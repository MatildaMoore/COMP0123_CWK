TI Entanglement degradation in causal diamonds
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW D
AB Entanglement degradation appears to be a generic prediction in relativistic quantum information whenever horizons restrict access to a region of spacetime. This property has been previously explored in connection with the Unruh effect, where a bipartite entangled system composed of an inertial observer (Alice) and a uniformly accelerated observer (Rob) was studied, with entanglement degradation caused by the relative acceleration-and with equivalent results for the case when Alice is freely falling into a black hole and Rob experiences a constant proper acceleration as a stationary near-horizon observer. In this work, we show that a similar degradation also occurs in the case of an entangled system composed of an inertial observer (Alice) and a "diamond observer" (Dave) with a finite lifetime. The condition of a finite lifetime is equivalent to the restriction of Dave's access within a causal diamond. Specifically, if the system starts in a maximally entangled state, prepared from Alice's perspective, entanglement degradation is enforced by the presence of the diamond's causal horizons.

TI Decomposing large unitaries into multimode devices of arbitrary size
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Decomposing complex unitary evolution into a series of constituent components is a cornerstone of practical quantum information processing. While the decomposition of an n x n unitary into a product of 2 x 2 subunitaries (which can for example be realized by beam splitters and phase shifters in linear optics) is well established, we show how for any m > 2 this decomposition can be generalized into a product of m x m subunitaries (which can then be realized by a more complex device acting on m modes). If the cost associated with building each m x m multimode device is less than constructing with m(m-1)/2 individual 2 x 2 devices, we show that the decomposition of large unitaries into m x m submatrices is more resource efficient and exhibits a higher tolerance to errors, than its 2 x 2 counterpart. This allows larger -scale unitaries to be constructed with lower errors, which is necessary for various tasks, not least boson sampling, the quantum Fourier transform, and quantum simulations.

TI Possible zero-magnetic field fractional quantization in
   In0.75Ga0.25As heterostructures
SO APPLIED PHYSICS LETTERS
AB In this Letter, we report a systematic study of a structure found in zero magnetic field at or near 0.2 x(e(2)/h) in In0.75Ga0.25As heterostructures, where e is the fundamental unit of charge and h is Planck's constant. This structure has been observed in many samples and stays at near constant conductance despite a large range of external potential changes, the stability indicating a quantum state. We have also studied the structure in the presence of high in-plane magnetic fields and find an anisotropy which can be related to the Rashba spin-orbit interaction and agrees with a recent theory based on the formation of coherent back-scattering. A possible state with conductance at 0.25 x(e(2)/h) has also been found. The quantum states described here will help with the fundamental understanding of low-dimensional electronic systems with strong spin-orbit coupling and may offer new perspectives for future applications in quantum information schemes.

TI Is the surface of Hofmann-like spin-crossover
   {Fe(pz)[Pt(CN)4]} the same as its bulk?
SO DALTON TRANSACTIONS
AB Temperature dependent X-ray photoemission spectroscopy (XPS) has been employed to examine the spin-crossover (SCO) transition in the nanocrystals of 3D Hoffman-like {Fe(pz)[Pt(CN)(4)]}. Consistent with the existing literature, the temperature-dependent variations in the Fe 2p core-level spectrum provide unambiguous evidence of the spin-state transition in this SCO complex. One of the many possible reasons behind a lack of discernible temperature-driven shifts in the binding energies of both the N 1s core-level components could be the immunity of its HS electronic configuration to thermal fluctuations. The high-spin fraction versus temperature plot, extrapolated from the XPS measurements, reveals that the surface of the nanocrystals of {Fe(pz)[Pt(CN)(4)]} is in the high-spin state at room temperature, rendering it promising for room-temperature spintronics and quantum information science applications.

TI Derivation of Emergent Spacetime Metric, Gravitational Potential and
   Speed of Light in Superfluid Vacuum Theory
SO UNIVERSE
AB Within the frameworks of the logarithmic superfluid model of physical vacuum, we demonstrate the emergence of four-dimensional curved spacetime from the dynamics of quantum Bose liquid in three-dimensional Euclidean space. We derive the metric tensor of this spacetime and study its special cases and limits, such as the linear-phase flow and linearized gravity limit. We show that the value of speed of light, which is a fundamental parameter in a theory of relativity, is a derived notion in superfluid vacuum theory: its value is a combination of the Planck constant and original parameters of the background superfluid. As for the gravitational potential, then it can be defined in terms of the quantum information entropy of the background superfluid. Thus, relativistic gravity and curved spacetime are shown to result from the dynamics of quantum excitations of the background superfluid being projected onto the measurement apparatus of a relativistic observer.

TI Minimal entanglement and emergent symmetries in low-energy QCD
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW C
AB We study low-energy scattering of spin-21 baryons from the perspective of quantum information science, focusing on the correlation between entanglement minimization and the appearance of accidental symmetries. The baryon transforms as an octet under the SU(3) flavor symmetry and its interactions below the pion threshold are described by contact operators in an effective field theory (EFT) of QCD. Despite there being 64 channels in the 2-to-2 scattering, only six independent operators in the EFT are predicted by SU(3). We show that successive entanglement minimization in SU(3 )-symmetric channels are correlated with increasingly large emergent symmetries in the EFT. In particular, we identify scattering channels whose entanglement suppression are indicative of emergent SU(6), SO(8), SU(8), and SU(16) symmetries. We also observe the appearance of non-relativistic conformal invariance in channels with unnaturally large scattering lengths. Improved precision from lattice simulations could help determine the degree of entanglement suppression, and consequently the amount of accidental symmetry, in low-energy QCD.

TI Atomic-Void van der Waals Channel Waveguides
SO NANO LETTERS
AB Layered van der Waals materials allow creating unique atomic-void channels with subnanometer dimensions. Coupling light into these channels may further advance sensing, quantum information, and single molecule chemistries. Here, we examine theoretically limits of light guiding in atomic-void channels and show that van der Waals materials exhibiting strong resonances, excitonic and polaritonic, are ideally suited for deeply subwavelength light guiding. We predict that excitonic transition metal dichalcogenides can squeeze >70% of optical power in just <lambda/100 thick channel in the visible and near-infrared. We also show that polariton resonances of hexagonal boron nitride allow deeply subwavelength (<lambda/500) guiding in the mid-infrared. We further reveal effects of natural material anisotropy and discuss the influence of losses. Such van der Waals channel waveguides while offering extreme optical confinement exhibit significantly lower loss compared to plasmonic counterparts, thus paving the way to low-loss and deeply subwavelength optics.

TI Degenerate squeezing in a dual-pumped integrated microresonator:
   Parasitic processes and their suppression
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Using a general Hamiltonian treatment, we theoretically study the generation of degenerate quadrature squeezing in a dual-pumped integrated microring resonator coupled to a waveguide. Considering a dual-pump four-wave mixing configuration in an integrated Si3N4 platform, and following the coupled-mode theory approach, we investigate the effects of parasitic quantum nonlinear optical processes on the generation of squeezed light. Considering five resonance modes in this approach allows us to include the most important four-wave mixing processes involved in such a configuration. We theoretically explore the effects of the pump detunings on different nonlinear processes and show that the effects of some of the parasitic processes are effectively neutralized by symmetrically detuning the two pumps. This yields a significant enhancement in the output squeezing quality without physically changing the structure, but suffers from the trade-off of requiring substantially higher pump power for a fixed target level of squeezing.

TI Dynamic Cooper Pair Splitter
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB Cooper pair splitters are promising candidates for generating spin-entangled electrons. However, the splitting of Cooper pairs is a random and noisy process, which hinders further synchronized operations on the entangled electrons. To circumvent this problem, we here propose and analyze a dynamic Cooper pair splitter that produces a noiseless and regular flow of spin-entangled electrons. The Cooper pair splitter is based on a superconductor coupled to quantum dots, whose energy levels are tuned in and out of resonance to control the splitting process. We identify the optimal operating conditions for which exactly one Cooper pair is split per period of the external drive and the flow of entangled electrons becomes noiseless. To characterize the regularity of the Cooper pair splitter in the time domain, we analyze the g(2) function of the output currents and the distribution of waiting times between split Cooper pairs. Our proposal is feasible using current technology, and it paves the way for dynamic quantum information processing with spinentangled electrons.

We introduce a number of techniques built on different geometric properties of the varieties of interest. Our main result is a simple characterization of the linear preservers of secant varieties of Segre varieties in many cases, including sigma r((Pn-1)xk) for all r 2J. We also characterize the linear preservers of several other sets of tensors, including subspace varieties, the variety of slice rank one tensors, symmetric tensors of bounded Waring rank, the variety of biseparable tensors, and hyperdeterminantal surfaces. Computational techniques and applications in quantum information theory are discussed.

AB Microresonator-based degenerate optical parametric oscillation (DOPO) has recently been explored as a compelling platform for all-optical computing and quantum information applications such as truly random number generation and the production of squeezed states of light. Emerging research has highlighted the potential of coupled microresonators, or photonic molecules, as a novel avenue for spectral engineering, unlocking an extra degree of freedom for the optimization of four-wave mixing interactions. Here, we demonstrate a single tunable DOPO within the coupled modes of a silicon nitride triplet-state photonic molecule. Our design introduces a distinctive mechanism for spectral engineering, using microheaters to individually tune the resonance spectral positions, thus enabling dynamic local dispersion control within the coupled modes. We successfully generated a DOPO signal with active efficiency control and explored the optical mode spacing in the tens of gigahertz range to use native phase-locked optical pumps driven by a radio frequency source.

TI Parallel beam splitting based on gradient metasurface: from classical to
   quantum
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB Gradient metasurfaces are extensively utilized for polarized beam splitting (BS) in classical and quantum optics. Specifically, their phase gradient allows the path and polarization of multiple output lights to be locked by corresponding inputs. However, the full potential of this unique path-polarization-locked property in multi-beam splitting has not been investigated. Here, we demonstrate that a single metasurface can function as sequentially linked beam splitters, enabling the parallelization of a series of BS processes, which provides a multi-beam interference capability. In the classical region, we demonstrate that parallel BS allows continuous modulation of output light intensity and polarization state through input polarization adjustment. While in the quantum realm, parallel BS introduces an additional path-polarization correlation into Hong-Ou-Mandel interference for orthogonal circularly polarized photons. The principle of parallel BS through the metasurface presents a versatile approach to manipulate light at the micro-scale, which will have potential applications in optical computing and on-chip quantum information processing.

TI Entanglement entropy, phase transition, and island rule for
   Reissner-Nordström-AdS black holes
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW D
AB This study focuses on the examination of the island rule within the context of four-dimensional Reissner-Nordstr & ouml;m-anti-de Sitter (4D RN-AdS) black holes, illuminating the intricate relationship between the entanglement entropy and phase transitions of black holes. The entanglement entropy of 4D RN-AdS black holes follows the anticipated linear growth pattern before ultimately declining to a constant value, in accordance with the well-established Page curve. The novelty of this study lies in the examination of the influence, previously unexplored, of the first-order phase transition on the shape and evolution of the Page curve in situations involving both eternal and evaporating black holes. Despite the morphological alterations of the curve induced by the transition, the inherent unitarity of the system persists. As the evaporation progresses, the Page curve displays diverse configurations, unveiling phenomena that are novel and defies traditional expectations, thereby enriching our comprehension of the thermodynamics of black holes interlinked with quantum information.

TI The Schmidt Rank for the Commuting Operator Framework
SO COMMUNICATIONS IN MATHEMATICAL PHYSICS
AB In quantum information theory, the Schmidt rank is a fundamental measure for the entanglement dimension of a pure bipartite state. Its natural definition uses the Schmidt decomposition of vectors on bipartite Hilbert spaces, which does not exist (or at least is not canonically given) if the observable algebras of the local systems are allowed to be general C*-algebras. In this work, we generalize the Schmidt rank to the commuting operator framework where the joint system is not necessarily described by the minimal tensor product but by a general bipartite algebra. We give algebraic and operational definitions for the Schmidt rank and show their equivalence. We analyze bipartite states and compute the Schmidt rank in several examples: the vacuum in quantum field theory, Araki-Woods-Powers states, as well as ground states and translation invariant states on spin chains which are viewed as bipartite systems for the left and right half chains. We conclude with a list of open problems for the commuting operator framework.

TI Interconversion between block coherence and multipartite entanglement in
   many-body systems
SO NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB Coherence is intrinsically related to projective measurement. When the fixed projective measurement involves higher-rank projectors, the coherence resource is referred to as block coherence, which comes from the superposition of orthogonal subspaces. Here, we establish a set of quantitative relations for the interconversion between block coherence and multipartite entanglement under the framework of the block-incoherent operations. It is found that the converted multipartite entanglement is upper bounded by the initial block coherence of single-party system. Moreover, the generated multipartite entanglement can be transferred to its subsystems and restored to block coherence of the initial single-party system by means of local block-incoherent operations and classical communication. In addition, when only the coarse-grained quantum operations are accessible for the ancillary subsystems, we further demonstrate that a lossless resource interconversion is still realizable, and give a concrete example in three four-level systems. Our results provide a versatile approach to utilize different quantum resources in a cyclic fashion.

TI Study of shear Alfve'n waves with Landau quantization effect in
   degenerate relativistic plasma
SO JOURNAL OF KING SAUD UNIVERSITY SCIENCE
AB In a ground breaking endeavor, we investigate a fundamental quantum property of fermions, specifically electrons, within a non -uniform quantized magnetic field, unveiling novel insights into shear Alfve'n waves in the relativistic realm of quantum plasma, particularly within the context of a degenerate Fermi gas. Employing the quantum magnetohydrodynamic model, we delve into the profound implications of the Landau quantization effect. This quantum phenomenon holds paramount importance across diverse fields such as condensed matter physics, astrophysics, and quantum information. Our study focuses on a plasma composed of degenerate relativistic electrons coexisting with cold fluid ions, which are non -degenerate particles. The findings of this research reveal substantial modifications in the thermodynamic, kinetic, and dispersion relation characteristics of shear Alfve'n waves when subjected to a non -uniform quantized magnetic field. This exploration offers a pioneering perspective on the intricate interplay between quantum physics and plasma dynamics, with implications for a wide array of scientific disciplines.

TI Semi-device-independent quantum random number generator with a broadband
   squeezed state of light
SO NPJ QUANTUM INFORMATION
AB Random numbers are a basic ingredient of simulation algorithms and cryptography, and play a significant part in computer simulation and information processing. One prominent feature of a squeezed light is its lower fluctuation and more randomness in a pair of orthogonal oriented quadratures, thus it prompts a significant application in not only quantum information and quantum precision measurement but also an excellent entropy source for true random number generation. Here we report a generation of a high-efficiency semi-device-independent quantum random number based on a broadband squeezed light, where a reliable randomness source is unnecessary and a noisy local oscillator is allowed for homodyne detection. The equivalent generation of private random bits is at a rate of 580.7 Mbps. In addition, the use of squeezed light at 1.3 mu m enables the transmission of entropy sources and local oscillators at the metropolitan scale, thus expanding the potential applications of quantum random number generators based on non-classical state of light.

TI Quantum coherent control in pulsed waveguide optomechanics
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Coherent control of traveling acoustic excitations in a waveguide system is an interesting way to manipulate and transduce classical and quantum information. So far, these interactions, often based on optomechanical resonators or Brillouin scattering, have been studied in the steady-state regime using continuous waves. However, waveguide experiments are often based on optical pump pulses, which require treatment in a dynamic framework. In this paper, we present an effective Hamiltonian formalism in the dynamic regime using optical pulses that links waveguide optomechanics and cavity optomechanics, which can be used in the classical and quantum regime including quantum noise. Based on our formalism, a closed solution for coupled-mode equation under the undepleted assumption is provided and we found that the strong coupling regime is already accessible in current Brillouin waveguides by using pulses. We further investigate several possible experiments within waveguide optomechanics, including Brillouin-based coherent transfer, Brillouin cooling, and optoacoustic entanglement.

TI Multivariate trace inequalities, p-fidelity, and universal recovery
   beyond tracial settings
SO JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICAL PHYSICS
AB Trace inequalities are general techniques with many applications in quantum information theory, often replacing the classical functional calculus in noncommutative settings. The physics of quantum field theory and holography, however, motivates entropy inequalities in type III von Neumann algebras that lack a semifinite trace. The Haagerup and Kosaki L-p spaces enable re-expressing trace inequalities in non-tracial von Neumann algebras. In particular, we show this for the generalized Araki-Lieb-Thirring and Golden-Thompson inequalities from the work of Sutter et al. [Commun. Math. Phys. 352(1), 37 (2017)]. Then, using the Haagerup approximation method, we prove a general von Neumann algebra version of universal recovery map corrections to the data processing inequality for relative entropy. We also show subharmonicity of a logarithmic p-fidelity of recovery. Furthermore, we prove that the non-decrease of relative entropy is equivalent to the existence of an L-1-isometry implementing the channel on both input states.

TI Nonreciprocal vortex isolator via topology-selective stimulated
   Brillouin scattering
SO SCIENCE ADVANCES
AB Optical nonreciprocity, which breaks the symmetry between forward and backward propagating optical waves, has become vital in photonic systems and enables many key applications. So far, all the existing nonreciprocal systems are implemented for linearly or randomly polarized fundamental modes. Optical vortex modes, with wavefronts that spiral around the central axis of propagation, have been extensively studied over the past decades and offer an additional degree of freedom useful in many applications. Here, we report a light-driven nonreciprocal isolation system for optical vortex modes based on topology-selective stimulated Brillouin scattering (SBS) in chiral photonic crystal fiber. The device can be reconfigured as an amplifier or an isolator by adjusting the frequency of the control signal. The experimental results show vortex isolation of 22 decibels (dB), which is at the state of the art in fundamental mode isolators using SBS. This device may find applications in optical communications, fiber lasers, quantum information processing, and optical tweezers.

TI Quantum non-Hermitian topological sensors
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB We investigate in the framework of quantum noise theory how the striking boundary sensitivity recently discovered in the context of non-Hermitian (NH) topological phases may be harnessed to devise novel quantum sensors. Specifically, we study a quantum-optical setting of coupled modes arranged in an array with broken ring geometry that would realize a NH topological phase in the classical limit. Using methods from quantum-information theory of Gaussian states, we show that a small coupling induced between the ends of the broken ring may be detected with a precision that increases exponentially in the number of coupled modes, e.g., by heterodyne detection of two output modes. While this robust effect only relies on reaching a NH topological regime, we identify a resonance phenomenon without direct classical counterpart that provides an experimental knob for drastically enhancing the aforementioned exponential growth. Our findings pave the way towards designing quantum NH topological sensors that may observe with high precision any physical observable that couples to the boundary conditions of the device.

TI Nanotrappy: An open-source versatile package for cold-atom trapping
   close to nanostructures
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Trapping cold neutral atoms in close proximity to nanostructures has raised a large interest in recent years, pushing the frontiers of cavity-QED and boosting the emergence of the waveguide-QED field of research. The design of efficient dipole trapping schemes in evanescent fields is a crucial requirement and a difficult task. Here we present an open-source Python package for calculating optical trapping potentials for neutral atoms, especially in the vicinity of nanostructures. Given field distributions and for a variety of trap configurations, nanotrappy computes the three-dimensional trapping potentials as well as the trap properties, ranging from trap positions to trap frequencies and state-dependent light shifts. We demonstrate the versatility for various seminal structures in the field, e.g., optical nanofiber, alligator slow-mode photonic-crystal waveguide, and microtoroid. This versatile package facilitates the systematic design of structures and provides a full characterization of trapping potentials with applications to the coherent manipulation of atoms and quantum information science.

TI Shaping Temporal Correlation of Biphotons in a Hot Atomic Ensemble
SO ADVANCED PHOTONICS RESEARCH
AB The biphoton states have served as one of the candidates for most quantum-enabled technologies. Moreover, with the benefit of photon-atom interactions, biphotons with controllable wave functions are particularly interesting in quantum information processes. Herein, an experimental realization of the shaping temporal correlation of biphotons from the four-wave mixing process in a hot Rb atomic ensemble is presented. Based on the slow-light effect and electromagnetically induced transparency in the group delay region, the precursor-like propagation is observed and separated from the rising edge of the delayed wave packets of biphotons temporal correlation. In addition, the application of an additional dressing field enriches the features of the biphotons temporal correlation such as the manipulation of the dispersion experienced by the generated photons and controllable coherent time. Furthermore, with a higher optical depth and stronger dressing coupling effect, the temporal correlation of biphotons is shaped from the group delay region to the Rabi oscillation region and even superposed of them.

TI Robust control and preservation of quantum steering, nonlocality, and
   coherence in open atomic systems
SO OPEN PHYSICS
AB We investigate the robustness of Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR) steering, nonlocality, and quantum coherence in a bipartite atomic system coupled to cavity fields under the influence of decoherence. The system consists of two non-interacting atoms, where each atom is confined within a cavity that interacts with another cavity field, which plays a crucial role in governing the dynamical evolution of two atoms. Through a combination of analytical and numerical investigations, we demonstrate that quantum steering, Bell nonlocality, and coherence can be not only preserved but also enhanced by appropriately tuning the cavity-cavity interaction strength, effectively mitigating environmental decoherence and extending the coherence lifetime of the system. Our results reveal that, under optimal conditions, steering, nonlocality, and coherence remain resilient against decoherence over extended timescales. These findings offer valuable insights into the controlled manipulation of quantum resources in open quantum systems and have significant implications for quantum information processing and secure communication technologies.

TI Quantum-Inspired Fusion for Open-Domain Question Answering
SO ELECTRONICS
AB Open-domain question-answering systems need models capable of referencing multiple passages simultaneously to generate accurate answers. The Rational Fusion-in-Decoder (RFiD) model focuses on differentiating between causal relationships and spurious features by utilizing the encoders of the Fusion-in-Decoder model. However, RFiD reliance on partial token information limits its ability to determine whether the corresponding passage is a rationale for the question, potentially leading to inappropriate answers. To address this issue, we propose a Quantum-Inspired Fusion-in-Decoder (QFiD) model. Our approach introduces a Quantum Fusion Module (QFM) that maps single-dimensional into multi-dimensional hidden states, enabling the model to capture more comprehensive token information. Then, the classical mixture method from quantum information theory is used to fuse all information. Based on the fused information, the model can accurately predict the relationship between the question and passage. Experimental results on two prominent ODQA datasets, Natural Questions and TriviaQA, demonstrate that QFiD outperforms the strong baselines in automatic evaluations.

TI Spatial multiplexing for robust optical vortex transmission with optical
   nonlinearity
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB Optical vortex beams, with phase singularity characterized by a topological charge (TC), introduces a new dimension for optical communication, quantum information, and optical light manipulation. However, the evaluation of TCs after beam propagation remains a substantial challenge, impeding practical applications. Here, we introduce vortices in lateral arrays (VOILA), a novel spatial multiplexing approach that enables simultaneous transmission of a lateral array of multiple vortices. Leveraging advanced learning techniques, VOILA effectively decodes TCs, even in the presence of strong optical nonlinearities simulated experimentally. Notably, our approach achieves substantial improvements in single-shot bandwidth, surpassing single-vortex scheme by several orders of magnitude. Furthermore, our system exhibits precise fractional TC recognition in both linear and nonlinear regimes, providing possibilities for high-bandwidth communication. The capabilities of VOILA promise transformative contributions to optical information processing and structured light research, with significant potential for advancements in diverse fields.(c) 2023 Optica Publishing Group under the terms of the Optica Open Access Publishing Agreement

TI A universal metasurface antenna to manipulate all fundamental
   characteristics of electromagnetic waves
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Metasurfaces have promising potential to revolutionize a variety of photonic and electronic device technologies. However, metasurfaces that can simultaneously and independently control all electromagnetics (EM) waves' properties, including amplitude, phase, frequency, polarization, and momentum, with high integrability and programmability, are challenging and have not been successfully attempted. Here, we propose and demonstrate a microwave universal metasurface antenna (UMA) capable of dynamically, simultaneously, independently, and precisely manipulating all the constitutive properties of EM waves in a software-defined manner. Our UMA further facilitates the spatial- and time-varying wave properties, leading to more complicated waveform generation, beamforming, and direct information manipulations. In particular, the UMA can directly generate the modulated waveforms carrying digital information that can fundamentally simplify the architecture of information transmitter systems. The proposed UMA with unparalleled EM wave and information manipulation capabilities will spark a surge of applications from next-generation wireless systems, cognitive sensing, and imaging to quantum optics and quantum information science.

AB G4CMP simulates phonon and charge transport in cryogenic semiconductor crystals using the Geant4 toolkit. The transport code is capable of simulating the propagation of acoustic phonons as well as electron and hole charge carriers. Processes for anisotropic phonon propagation, oblique charge-carrier propagation, and phonon emission by accelerated charge carriers are included. The simulation reproduces theoretical predictions and experimental observations such as phonon caustics, heat-pulse propagation times, and mean charge-carrier drift velocities. In addition to presenting the physics and features supported by G4CMP, this report outlines example applications from the dark matter and quantum information science communities. These communities are applying G4CMP to model and design devices for which the energy transported by phonons and charge carriers is germane to the performance of superconducting instruments and circuits placed on silicon and germanium substrates. The G4CMP package is available to download from GitHub: github.com/kelseymh/G4CMP.

TI Microcantilever-integrated photonic circuits for broadband laser beam
   scanning
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Laser beam scanning is central to many applications, including displays, microscopy, three-dimensional mapping, and quantum information. Reducing the scanners to microchip form factors has spurred the development of very-large-scale photonic integrated circuits of optical phased arrays and focal plane switched arrays. An outstanding challenge remains to simultaneously achieve a compact footprint, broad wavelength operation, and low power consumption. Here, we introduce a laser beam scanner that meets these requirements. Using microcantilevers embedded with silicon nitride nanophotonic circuitry, we demonstrate broadband, one- and two-dimensional steering of light with wavelengths from 410 nm to 700 nm. The microcantilevers have ultracompact similar to 0.1 mm(2) areas, consume similar to 31 to 46 mW of power, are simple to control, and emit a single light beam. The microcantilevers are monolithically integrated in an active photonic platform on 200-mm silicon wafers. The microcantilever-integrated photonic circuits miniaturize and simplify light projectors to enable versatile, power-efficient, and broadband laser scanner microchips.

TI Binuclear Lanthanide Complexes Based on 4-Picoline-N-oxide: From
   Sensitized Luminescence to Single-Molecule Magnet Characteristics
SO CRYSTAL GROWTH & DESIGN
AB : Lanthanide complexes featuring luminescent and/or single-molecule magnet (SMM) characteristic(s) are proposed candidates to develop molecule-based spintronics, memory, and quantum information processing (QIP) device architectures. Herein, we report on the luminescent and/or SMM characteristic(s) of charge-neutral binuclear lanthanide complexes-[Ln2Cl6(4picNO)4(mu 2-4-picNO)2]& BULL;2H2O (Ln3+ = Tb3+ ([Tb2]) or Dy3+ ([Dy2]); 4-picNO = 4-picoline-N-oxide). The Dy and Tb complexes show 4-picNO-sensitized luminescence with quantum yields in the solid state of 0.14% and 88%, respectively. The luminescent Dy complex is an SMM with a magnetization reversal barrier (Ueff) = 20.6(4) cm-1 under zero applied magnetic field, whereas the Tb complex is not an SMM. The facile preparation of [Ln2Cl6(4-picNO)4(mu 2-4-picNO)2]& BULL;2H2O complexes showing high luminescence quantum yield (Tb3+) and SMM characteristics (Dy3+) might prove useful toward the designing of analogue luminescent-SMM hybrids suitable for technological applications.

TI Spin coherence times of point defects in two-dimensional materials from
   first principles
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
AB The spin coherence times of 69 triplet defect centers in 45 different 2D host materials are calculated using the cluster-correlation expansion method with parameters of the spin Hamiltonian obtained from density-functional theory. Several of the triplets are found to exhibit extraordinarily large spin coherence times making them interesting for quantum information processing. The dependence of the spin coherence time on various factors, including the hyperfine coupling strength, the dipole-dipole coupling, and the nuclear g factors, are systematically investigated. The analysis shows that the spin coherence time is insensitive to the atomistic details of the defect center and rather is dictated by the nuclear-spin properties of the host material. Symbolic regression is then used to derive a simple expression for the spin coherence time, which is validated on a test set of 55 doublet defects unseen by the regression model. The simple expression permits order-of-magnitude estimates of the spin coherence time without expensive first-principles calculations.

TI Quantum Squeezing Induced Optical Nonreciprocity
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB We propose an all-optical approach to achieve optical nonreciprocity on a chip by quantum squeezing one of two coupled resonator modes. By parametric pumping a x(2)-nonlinear resonator unidirectionally with a classical coherent field, we squeeze the resonator mode in a selective direction due to the phasematching condition, and induce a chiral photon interaction between two resonators. Based on this chiral interresonator coupling, we achieve an all-optical diode and a three-port quasicirculator. By applying a second squeezed-vacuum field to the squeezed resonator mode, our nonreciprocal device also works for single-photon pulses. We obtain an isolation ratio of 40 dB for the diode and fidelity of > 98% for the quasicirculator, and insertion loss of < 1 dB for both. We also show that nonreciprocal transmission of strong light can be switched on and off by a relative weak pump light. This achievement implies a nonreciprocal optical transistor. Our protocol opens up a new route to achieve integrable all-optical nonreciprocal devices permitting chip-compatible optical isolation and nonreciporcal quantum information processing.

TI Interferometric spectroscopy with quantum light: Revealing
   out-of-time-ordering correlators
SO JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL PHYSICS
AB We survey the inclusion of interferometric elements in nonlinear spectroscopy performed with quantum light. Controlled interference of electromagnetic fields coupled to matter can induce constructive or destructive contributions of microscopic coupling sequences (histories) of matter. Since quantum fields do not commute, quantum light signals are sensitive to the order of light-matter coupling sequences. Matter correlation functions are thus imprinted by different field factors, which depend on that order. We identify the associated quantum information obtained by controlling the weights of different contributing pathways and offer several experimental schemes for recovering it. Nonlinear quantum response functions include out-of-time-ordering matter correlators (OTOCs), which reveal how perturbations spread throughout a quantum system (information scrambling). Their effect becomes most notable when using ultrafast pulse sequences with respect to the path difference induced by the interferometer. OTOCs appear in quantum-informatics studies in other fields, including black hole, high energy, and condensed matter physics.

TI Constraining rapidly oscillating scalar dark matter using dynamic
   decoupling
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW D
AB We propose and experimentally demonstrate a method for detection of a light scalar dark matter (DM) field through probing temporal oscillations of fundamental constants in an atomic optical transition. Utilizing the quantum information notion of dynamic decoupling (DD) in a tabletop setting, we are able to obtain model-independent bounds on variations of alpha and m(e) at frequencies up to the MHz scale. We interpret our results to constrain the parameter space of light scalar DM field models. We consider the generic case, where the couplings of the DM field to the photon and the electron are independent, as well as the case of a relaxion DM model, including the scenario of a DM boson star centered around Earth. Given the particular nature of DD, allowing one to directly observe the oscillatory behavior of coherent DM and considering future experimental improvements, we conclude that our proposed method could be complimentary to, and possibly competitive with, gravitational probes of light scalar DM.

TI Direct Experimental Certification of Quantum Non-Gaussian Character and
   Wigner Function Negativity of Single-Photon Detectors
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB Highly nonclassical character of optical quantum detectors, such as single-photon detectors, is essential for preparation of quantum states of light and a vast majority of applications in quantum metrology and quantum information processing. Therefore, it is both fundamentally interesting and practically relevant to investigate the nonclassical features of optical quantum measurements. Here we propose and experimentally demonstrate a procedure for direct certification of quantum non-Gaussianity and Wigner function negativity, two crucial nonclassicality levels, of photonic quantum detectors. Remarkably, we characterize the highly nonclassical properties of the detector by probing it with only two classical thermal states and a vacuum state. We experimentally demonstrate the quantum non-Gaussianity of a single-photon avalanche diode even under the presence of background noise, and we also certify the negativity of the Wigner function of this detector. Our results open the way for direct benchmarking of photonic quantum detectors with a few measurements on classical states.

TI A highly efficient photodetector for squeezed light measurement in the
   gigahertz range
SO APPLIED PHYSICS LETTERS
AB Squeezed light plays a crucial role in state-of-the-art quantum metrology and quantum information experiments. There is significant interest in utilizing squeezed states at high MHz and GHz frequencies. However, past efforts to build suitable photodetectors at these frequencies have yet to yield the required high quantum efficiency. Here, we present the development of a high-frequency balanced photodetector with near-unity quantum efficiency, realized with off-the-shelf components. The detector operates in balanced mode up to approximately 500 MHz, above which the differential frequency response limits its performance. To obtain high sensitivity above 500 MHz, the detector can be efficiently used in an unbalanced homodyne detection scheme. We employ our detector in this unbalanced mode to measure a squeezing comb up to 6.4 GHz, achieving a squeezing level of up to 10.7 dB. By sharing our experience, specifically in identifying the unequal frequency response as a limiting factor, we aim to enable and advance further developments in the field.

   States (Invited)
SO LASER & OPTOELECTRONICS PROGRESS
AB Antichiral topological photonic states are a new type of waveguide states that are robust against backscattering and immune to defects. They propagate unidirectionally in the same direction along two parallel boundaries of topological photonic crystal and show broad application potential in topological lasers, integrated optical circuits, and quantum information. This review focuses on the research progress in antichiral topological photonic states, starting from the Dirac model and derivation of the classical Haldane model, antichiral Haldane model, and heterogeneous Haldane model, which demonstrate the transmission behavior of different types of topological photonic states. In addition, the implementation of chiral edge states, antichiral edge states, and one-way bulk states in photonic crystals is discussed. Next, the construction of topological optical devices based on antichiral topological photonic states, such as compact unidirectional waveguides, topological ring cavities, and topological beam splitter, are introduced. Finally, the critical issues and future development trends in research on antichiral topological photonic states are analyzed.

TI Enhanced photon routing beyond the blockade limit via linear optics
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Directing indistinguishable photons from one input port into separate output ports is a fundamental operation in quantum information processing. The simplest scheme for achieving routing beyond random chance uses the photon blockade effect of a two-level emitter. But this approach is limited by a time-energy uncertainty relation. We show that a linear optical unitary transformation applied after the atom enables splitting efficiencies that exceed this time-energy limit. We show that the linear optical unitary improves the splitting efficiency from 67% to 82% for unentangled photon inputs, and from 77% to 90% for entangled photon inputs. We then optimize the temporal mode profile of the entangled photon wave function to attain the optimal splitting efficiency of 92%, a significant improvement over previous limits derived using a two-level atom alone. These results provide a path towards optimizing single photon nonlinearities and engineering programmable and robust photon-photon interactions for practical, high-fidelity quantum operations.

TI Efficient pathway to NaCs ground state molecules
SO NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB We present a study of two-photon pathways for the transfer of NaCs molecules to their rovibrational ground state. Starting from NaCs Feshbach molecules, we perform bound-bound excited state spectroscopy in the wavelength range from 900 nm to 940 nm, covering more than 30 vibrational states of the c(3)Sigma(+), b(3)Pi, and B-1 Pi electronic states. Analyzing the rotational substructure, we identify the highly mixed c(3)Sigma(+)(1) |v = 22 > similar to b(1)(3 Pi) |v = 54) state as an efficient bridge for stimulated Raman adiabatic passage. We demonstrate transfer into the NaCs ground state with an efficiency of up to 88(4)%. Highly efficient transfer is critical for the realization of many-body quantum phases of strongly dipolar NaCs molecules and high fidelity detection of single molecules, for example, in spin physics experiments in optical lattices and quantum information experiments in optical tweezer arrays.

TI Unidirectionally excited phonon polaritons in high-symmetry orthorhombic
   crystals
SO SCIENCE ADVANCES
AB Advanced control over the excitation of ultraconfined polaritons-hybrid light and matter waves-empowers unique opportunities for many nanophotonic functionalities, e.g., on-chip circuits, quantum information processing, and controlling thermal radiation. Recent work has shown that highly asymmetric polaritons are directly governed by asymmetries in crystal structures. Here, we experimentally demonstrate extremely asymmetric and unidirectional phonon polariton (PhP) excitation via directly patterning high-symmetry orthorhombic van der Waals (vdW) crystal alpha-MoO3. This phenomenon results from symmetry breaking of momentum matching in polaritonic diffraction in vdW materials. We show that the propagation of PhPs can be versatile and robustly tailored via structural engineering, while PhPs in low-symmetry (e.g., monoclinic and triclinic) crystals are largely restricted by their naturally occurring permittivities. Our work synergizes grating diffraction phenomena with the extreme anisotropy of high-symmetry vdW materials, enabling unexpected control of infrared polaritons along different pathways and opening opportunities for applications ranging from on-chip photonics to directional heat dissipation.

AB Scalable coherent control hardware for quantum information platforms is rapidly growing in priority as their number of available qubits continues to increase. As these systems scale, more calibration steps are needed, leading to challenges with system instability as calibrated parameters drift. Moreover, the sheer amount of data required to run circuits with large depth tends to balloon, especially when implementing state-of-the-art dynamical-decoupling gates which require advanced modulation techniques. We present a control system that addresses these challenges for trapped-ion systems, through a combination of novel features that eliminate the need for manual bookkeeping, reduction in data transfer bandwidth requirements via gate compression schemes, and other automated error handling techniques. Moreover, we describe an embedded pulse compiler that applies staged optimization, including compressed intermediate representations of parsed output products, performs in-situ mutation of compressed gate data to support high-level algorithmic feedback to account for drift, and can be run entirely on chip.

Tilted Weyl semimetals possess tilted Weyl cones at the Weyl nodes and are categorized to type-I with closed Fermi surfaces and type-II with overtilted Weyl cones and open Fermi surfaces. We find that the surface plasmon polariton dispersion of this system is nonreciprocal even in the absence of the external magnetic field. Moreover, we demonstrate that the tilt parameter has a profound effect in controlling this nonreciprocity. We reveal that the thin film of type-II Weyl semimetal hosts the surface plasmon polariton modes with the negative group velocity. Furthermore, we show that the angular optical spectra of this structure are highly asymmetric and this angular asymmetry in the absorptivity and reflectivity depends profoundly on the tilt parameter of the tilted Weyl semimetal. These exciting features propose employing the tilted Weyl semimetals in optical sensing devices, optical data storage, and devices for quantum information processing.

TI Isotropic all-electric spin analyzer based on a quantum ring with
   spin-orbit couplings
SO APPLIED PHYSICS LETTERS
AB Isotropic spin analysis is a key step in spintronics and could be useful in quantum information, which usually requires light as an essential component. It has not yet been realized in a solid-state device. Here, we propose an isotropic all electrical spin analyzer designed from a quantum ring with spin-orbit couplings by analytically and numerically modeling how the charge transmission rate depends on the polarization of the incident spin. The spin transport features are also demonstrated to be robust against ring structure defects, disorder, and a bias between the two leads at finite temperature in the nanoscale ring. Similar to the light polarizer/analyzer, this interesting two-dimensional electron system can be designed as a spin filter, spin polarizer, and a general spin analyzer with high resolution by simply tuning the spin-orbit couplings, which paves the way for realizing the tunable and integrable spintronics devices.

TI Squeezed light generation in periodically poled thin-film lithium
   niobate waveguides
SO NANOPHOTONICS
AB Squeezed states of light play a key role in quantum-enhanced sensing and continuous-variable quantum information processing. Realizing integrated squeezed light sources is crucial for developing compact and scalable photonic quantum systems. In this work, we demonstrate on-chip broadband vacuum squeezing at telecommunication wavelengths on the thin-film lithium niobate (TFLN) platform. Our device integrates periodically poled lithium niobate (PPLN) nanophotonic waveguides with low-loss edge couplers, comprising bilayer inverse tapers and an SU-8 polymer waveguide. This configuration achieves a fiber-to-chip coupling loss of 1.4 dB and a total homodyne detection loss of 4.0 dB, enabling a measured squeezing level of 1.4 dB. Additional measurements in a more efficient PPLN waveguide (without low-loss couplers) infer an on-chip squeezing level of approximately 10 dB at a pump power of 62 mW. These results underscore the potential of TFLN platform for efficient and scalable squeezed light generation.

TI High-throughput identification of spin-photon interfaces in silicon
SO SCIENCE ADVANCES
AB Color centers in host semiconductors are prime candidates as spin-photon interfaces for quantum applications. Finding an optimal spin-photon interface in silicon would move quantum information technologies toward a mature semiconducting host. However, the space of possible charged defects is vast, making the identification of candidates from experiments alone extremely challenging. Here, we use high-throughput first-principles computational screening to identify spin-photon interfaces among more than 1000 charged defects in silicon. The use of a single-shot hybrid functional approach is critical in enabling the screening of many quantum defects with a reasonable accuracy. We identify three promising spin-photon interfaces as potential bright emitters in the telecom band: Ti-i(+), Fe-i(0), and Ru-i(0). These candidates are excited through defect-bound excitons, stressing the importance of such defects in silicon for telecom band operations. Our work paves the way to further large-scale computational screening for quantum defects in semiconductors.

TI Extending the Spin Excitation Lifetime of a Magnetic Molecule on a
   Proximitized Superconductor
SO NANO LETTERS
AB Molecular spins on surfaces potentially used in quantum information processing and data storage require long spin excitation lifetimes. Normally, coupling of the molecular spin with the conduction electrons of metallic surfaces causes fast relaxation of spin excitations. However, the presence of superconducting pairing effects in the substrate can protect the excited spin from decaying. In this work, we show that a proximity-induced superconducting gold film can sustain spin excitations of a FeTPP-Cl molecule for more than 80 ns. This long value was determined by studying inelastic spin excitations of the S = 5/2 multiplet of FeTPP-Cl on Au films over V(100) using scanning tunneling spectroscopy. The spin lifetime decreases with increasing film thickness, along with the decrease of the effective superconducting gap. Our results elucidate the use of proximitized gold electrodes for addressing quantum spins on surfaces, envisioning new routes for tuning the value of their spin lifetime.

TI Genuine N-partite entanglement and distributed relationships in the
   background of dilation black holes
SO EUROPEAN PHYSICAL JOURNAL C
AB With the complexity of information tasks, the bipartite and tripartite entanglement can no longer meet our needs, and we need more entangled particles to process relativistic quantum information. In this paper, we study the genuine N-partite entanglement and distributed relationships for Dirac fields in the background of dilaton black holes. We present the general analytical expression including all physically accessible and inaccessible entanglement in curved spacetime. We find that the accessible N-partite entanglement exhibits irreversible decoherence as the increase of black hole's dilaton, and on the other hand the inaccessible N-partite entanglement increases from zero monotonically or non-monotonically, depending on the relative numbers of the accessible to the inaccessible modes, which forms a sharp contrast with the cases of bipartite and tripartite entanglement where the inaccessible entanglement increase only monotonically. We also find two distributed relationships between accessible and inaccessible N-partite entanglement in curved spacetime. The results give us a new understanding of the Hawking radiation.

TI Improving the spectral purity of single photons by a
   single-interferometer-coupled microring
SO CHINESE PHYSICS B
AB We experimentally engineer a high-spectral-purity single-photon source using a single-interferometer-coupled silicon microring. By the reconfiguration of the interferometer, different coupling conditions can be obtained, corresponding to different quality factors for the pump and signal/idler. The ratio between the quality factor of the pump and signal/idler ranges from 0.29 to 2.57. By constructing the signal-idler joint spectral intensity, we intuitively demonstrate the spectral correlation of the signal and idler. As the ratio between the quality factor of the pump and signal/idler increases, the spectral correlation of the signal and idler decreases, i.e., the spectral purity of the signal/idler photons increases. Furthermore, time-integrated second-order correlation of the signal photons is measured, giving a value up to 94.95 +/- 3.46%. Such high-spectral-purity photons will improve the visibility of quantum interference and facilitate the development of on-chip quantum information processing.

TI Gate control, g factors, and spin-orbit energy of p-type
   GaSb nanowire quantum dot devices
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
AB Proposals for quantum information applications are frequently based on the coherent manipulation of spins confined to quantum dots. For these applications, p-type III-V material systems promise a reduction of the hyperfine interaction while maintaining large g factors and strong spin-orbit interaction. In this Letter, we study bottom-gated device architectures to realize single and serial multiquantum dot systems in Schottky-contacted p-type GaSb nanowires. We find that the effect of potentials applied to gate electrodes on the nanowire is highly localized to the immediate vicinity of the gate electrode only, which prevents the formation of double quantum dots with commonly used device architectures. We further study the transport properties of a single quantum dot induced by bottom gating and find large gate-voltage dependent variations of the g* factors up to 8.1 +/- 0.2 as well as spin-orbit energies between 110 and 230 mu eV.

TI Nonseparability of multipartite systems in dilaton black hole
SO JOURNAL OF COSMOLOGY AND ASTROPARTICLE PHYSICS
AB We investigate the nonseparability of N-partite quantum systems by employing the Abe-Rajagopal (AR) q-conditional entropy for both free bosonic and fermionic fields in the background of a Garfinkle-Horowitz-Strominger (GHS) dilaton black hole. An intriguing finding is that the Hawking effect of the black hole can generate a net nonseparability of W state for fermionic field. Notably, we observe that fermionic nonseparability exhibits a stronger robustness than its bosonic counterpart, while fermionic coherence is found to be weaker than bosonic coherence within the dilaton black hole background. Additionally, our analysis reveals that the nonseparability of GHZ state is more pronounced than that of W state, yet quantum coherence of GHZ state is comparatively weaker than that of W state in dilaton spacetime. These results suggest that choosing the appropriate quantum resources for different particle types and quantum state configurations is essential for effectively tackling relativistic quantum information tasks.

TI New partial trace inequalities and distillability of Werner states
SO LETTERS IN MATHEMATICAL PHYSICS
AB One of the oldest problems in quantum information theory is to study if there exists a state with negative partial transpose which is undistillable [1]. This problem has been open for almost 30 years, and still no one has been able to give a complete answer to it. This work presents a new strategy to try to solve this problem by translating the distillability condition on the family of Werner states into a problem of partial trace inequalities, this is the aim of our first main result. As a consequence, we obtain a new bound for the 2-distillability of Werner states, which does not depend on the dimension of the system. On the other hand, our second main result provides new partial trace inequalities for bipartite systems, connecting some of them also with the separability of Werner states. Throughout this work, we also present numerous partial trace inequalities, which are valid for many families of matrices.

AB If a sender and a receiver lack precise knowledge about the communication line that connects them, designing a scheme to reliably transmit information becomes more challenging. This has been studied in classical and quantum information theory in the context of compound channel models and arbitrarily varying channel models. However, a fully quantum version of system uncertainty allows for an even more challenging coding scenario with entangled channel uses. This type of model has previously been investigated for classical and quantum capacity. Here, we address the problem of entanglement-assisted capacity in the presence of such system uncertainty. We find that, under the assumption of a finite environment dimension, it is equal to a corresponding compound capacity. Intriguingly, our results imply that in certain fully quantum arbitrarily varying channel models, the entanglement-assisted capacity can be positive while the classical capacity is equal to zero, a phenomenon that does not occur in regular single-channel coding.

TI Separable ball around any full-rank multipartite product state
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICS A-MATHEMATICAL AND THEORETICAL
AB We show that around any m-partite product state rho prod =rho 1 circle times......circle times rho m of full rank (that is det(rho(prod))not equal 0), there exists a finite-sized closed ball of separable states centered around.prod whose radius is ss := 21-m/2.min(.prod). Here, lambda min(rho prod) is the smallest eigenvalue of rho prod. We are assuming that the total Hilbert space is finite dimensional and we use the notion of distance induced by the Frobenius norm. Applying a scaling relation, we also give a new and simple sufficient criterion for multipartite separability based on trace: Tr[rho rho prod](2)/ Tr[rho(2)]>= Tr[rho(2)prod]- ss(2). Using the separable balls around the fullrank product states, we discuss the existence and possible sizes of separable balls around any multipartite separable states, which are important features for the set of all separable states. We discuss the implication of these separable balls on entanglement dynamics.

TI Data assimilation in operator algebras
SO PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF
   AMERICA
AB We develop an algebraic framework for sequential data assimilation of partially observed dynamical systems. In this framework, Bayesian data assimilation is embedded in a nonabelian operator algebra, which provides a representation of observables by multiplication operators and probability densities by density operators (quantum states). In the algebraic approach, the forecast step of data assimilation is represented by a quantum operation induced by the Koopman operator of the dynamical system. Moreover, the analysis step is described by a quantum effect, which generalizes the Bayesian observational update rule. Projecting this formulation to finite-dimensional matrix algebras leads to computational schemes that are i) automatically positivity-preserving and ii) amenable to consistent data-driven approximation using kernel methods for machine learning. Moreover, these methods are natural candidates for implementation on quantum computers. Applications to the Lorenz 96 multiscale system and the El Nino Southern Oscillation in a climate model show promising results in terms of forecast skill and uncertainty quantification.

TI Quantumness of Pure-State Ensembles via Coherence of Gram Matrix Based
   on Generalized α-z-Relative Renyi Entropy
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF THEORETICAL PHYSICS
AB The Gram matrix of a set of quantum pure states plays key roles in quantum information theory. It has been highlighted that the Gram matrix of a pure-state ensemble can be viewed as a quantum state, and the quantumness of a pure-state ensemble can thus be quantified by the coherence of the Gram matrix [Europhys. Lett. 134, 30003]. Instead of the l(1)-norm of coherence and the relative entropy of coherence, we utilize the generalized alpha-z-relative Renyi entropy of coherence of the Gram matrix to quantify the quantumness of a pure-state ensemble and explore its properties. We show the usefulness of this quantifier by calculating the quantumness of six important pure-state ensembles. Furthermore, we compare our quantumness with other existing ones and show their features as well as orderings.

TI Design of an optomagnonic crystal: Towards optimal magnon-photon mode
   matching at the microscale
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB We put forward the concept of an optomagnonic crystal: a periodically patterned structure at the microscale based on a magnetic dielectric, which can co-localize magnon and photon modes. The co-localization in small volumes can result in large values of the photon-magnon coupling at the single quanta level, which opens perspectives for quantum information processing and quantum conversion schemes with these systems. We study theoretically a simple geometry consisting of a one-dimensional array of holes with an abrupt defect, considering the ferrimagnet yttrium iron garnet (YIG) as the basis material. We show that both magnon and photon modes can be localized at the defect, and use symmetry arguments to select an optimal pair of modes in order to maximize the coupling. We show that an optomagnonic coupling in the kHz range is achievable in this geometry, and discuss possible optimization routes in order to improve both coupling strengths and optical losses.

As stabilizer states can be prepared efficiently using classical computers, and include classes of entangled states, it is quantum magic and fluctuations in quantum magic, together with entanglement, that determine computational resource requirements. As a measure of fluctuations in quantum magic, and hence the severity of the exponentially scaling classical computing resource requirements, induced by scattering, the "magic power" of the S-matrix is introduced. This provides indirect experimental constraints on quantum resources required to model nuclei and dense matter using fault-tolerant quantum computers. Using experimentally determined scattering phase shifts and mixing parameters, the magic power in nucleon-nucleon and hyperon-nucleon scattering, along with the magic in the deuteron, are found to exhibit interesting and distinct features. The E--baryon is identified as a potential candidate catalyst for enhanced spreading of magic and entanglement in dense matter, depending on in-medium decoherence.

TI Self-induced nonreciprocity from asymmetric photonic topological
   insulators
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW APPLIED
AB Photonic topological insulators and self-induced nonreciprocity based on nonlinear effects in asymmetric structures have garnered increased attention due to their potential applications in quantum information technologies and advanced photonic integrated circuits. In this study, we combine these two fields and present asymmetric photonic crystal designs based on all-dielectric checkerboard structures forming topological interfaces. The resulting topological photonic structures lead to the emergence of a narrowband leaky mode in their linear transmission response, accompanied by an edge state with topological protection. The incorporation of the nonlinear optical Kerr effect in the system results in spectral tunability and transmission nonreciprocity in the induced topological edge states, as the input beam intensity is increased, due to the introduction of asymmetric defects along the interface. We envision that the findings presented in our work will lead to tunable photonic topological insulators with a nonreciprocal response that promise to provide new avenues for the development of next-generation photonic devices and quantum optical technologies.

TI Cryogenic hybrid magnonic circuits based on spalled YIG thin films
SO JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYSICS
AB Yttrium iron garnet (YIG) magnonics has garnered significant research interest because of the unique properties of magnons (quasiparticles of collective spin excitation) for signal processing. In particular, hybrid systems based on YIG magnonics show great promise for quantum information science due to their broad frequency tunability and strong compatibility with other platforms. However, their broad applications have been severely constrained by substantial microwave loss in the gadolinium gallium garnet (GGG) substrate at cryogenic temperatures. In this study, we demonstrate that YIG thin films can be spalled from YIG/GGG samples. Our approach is validated by measuring hybrid devices comprising superconducting resonators and spalled YIG films, which exhibit anti-crossing features that indicate strong coupling between magnons and microwave photons. Such new capability of separating YIG thin films from GGG substrates via spalling and the integrated superconductor-YIG devices represent a significant advancement for integrated magnonic devices, paving the way for advanced magnon-based coherent information processing.

TI Strong radiative coupling between two quantum emitters with arbitrary
   mutual orientation via a silver nano-arc
SO PHYSICA SCRIPTA
AB Strong radiative coupling realizes coherent exchange of single excitation between two quantum emitters, while their dipole orientation influences the coupling strength in anisotropic environments. We propose a silver nano-arc with arbitrary radian which can support two hot spots of electric field with radian-independent resonant wavelength. Two quantum emitters resonant with the cavity mode, embedded inside the two hot spots and oriented along the nano-arc axis, can realize strong radiative coupling, verified by the large splitting and anti-crossing behavior in the spectrum and the population oscillation in the time domain. All these signatures of strong radiative coupling are robust against the nano-arc's curvature. Our work provides a flexible approach to realize strong radiative coupling between two quantum emitters with arbitrary mutual orientation and facilitates quantum information processing.

TI Quantum tomography of helicity states for general scattering processes
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW D
AB Quantum tomography has become an indispensable tool in order to compute the density matrix p of quantum systems in physics. Recently, it has further gained importance as a basic step to test entanglement and violation of Bell inequalities in high-energy particle physics. In this work, we present the theoretical framework for reconstructing the helicity quantum initial state of a general scattering process. In particular, we perform an expansion of p over the irreducible tensor operators { T L M } and compute the corresponding coefficients uniquely by averaging, under properly chosen Wigner D-matrices weights, the angular distribution data of the final particles. Besides, we provide the explicit angular dependence of a novel generalization of the production matrix Gamma and of the normalized differential cross section of the scattering. Finally, we rederive all our previous results from a quantum-information perspective using the WeylWigner-Moyal formalism and we obtain, in addition, simple analytical expressions for the Wigner P and Q symbols.

TI Enhanced spontaneous radiation of quantum dots based on modulated
   anapole states in dielectric metamaterial
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB Dielectric nanostructures exhibit low -loss electrical and magnetic resonance, making them ideal for quantum information processing. In this study, the periodic double -groove silicon nanodisk (DGSND) is used to support the anapole state. Based on the distribution properties of the electromagnetic field in anapole states, the anapoles are manipulated by cutting the dielectric metamaterial. Quantum dots (QDs) are used to stimulate the anapole and control the amplification of the photoluminescence signal within the QDs. By opening symmetrical holes in the long axis of the nanodisk in the dielectric metamaterial, the current distribution of Mie resonance can be adjusted. As a result, the toroidal dipole moment is altered, leading to an enhanced electric field ( E -field) and Purcell factor. When the dielectric metamaterial is deposited on the Ag substrate separated by the silicon dioxide (SiO 2 ) layer, the structure exhibits ultra -narrow perfect absorption with even higher E -field and Purcell factor enhancement compared to silicon (Si) nanodisks.

TI Entanglement Monogamy via Multivariate Trace Inequalities
SO COMMUNICATIONS IN MATHEMATICAL PHYSICS
AB Entropy is a fundamental concept in quantum information theory that allows to quantify entanglement and investigate its properties, for example its monogamy over multipartite systems. Here, we derive variational formulas for relative entropies based on restricted measurements of multipartite quantum systems. By combining these with multivariate matrix trace inequalities, we recover and sometimes strengthen various existing entanglement monogamy inequalities. In particular, we give direct, matrix-analysis-based proofs for the faithfulness of squashed entanglement by relating it to the relative entropy of entanglement measured with one-way local operations and classical communication, as well as for the faithfulness of conditional entanglement of mutual information by relating it to the separably measured relative entropy of entanglement. We discuss variations of these results using the relative entropy to states with positive partial transpose, and multipartite setups. Our results simplify and generalize previous derivations in the literature that employed operational arguments about the asymptotic achievability of information-theoretic tasks.

TI Compact and sturdy orbital angular momentum sorter without destroying
   photon states
SO JOURNAL OF OPTICS
AB The orbital angular momentum (OAM) has been widely studied and applied to many scientific fields, especially in optical communication and quantum information. In order to give full play to the high-dimensional characteristics of OAM, separating different OAM states is a fundamental requirement. Here we find a way to introduce the mode dependent phase shift by using Porro prism, design and manufacture a new kind of two-output OAM sorter. Our OAM sorter can separate two OAM states with different topological charges without destroying them. Because it is composed of several linear commonly optical elements, which can be closely pasted together, our OAM sorter is very compact and sturdy. Furthermore, by means of cascading, our design can be used for constructing an OAM sorter with multiple output ports. Therefore, our research should have great potential application prospects, especially in the communication protocol based on OAM.

TI Thermodynamics of Quantum Spin-Bath Depolarization
SO ENTROPY
AB We analyze here through exact calculations the thermodynamical effects in depolarizing a quantum spin-bath initially at zero temperature through a quantum probe coupled to an infinite temperature bath by evaluating the heat and entropy changes. We show that the correlations induced in the bath during the depolarizing process does not allow for the entropy of the bath to increase towards its maximal limit. On the contrary, the energy deposited in the bath can be completely extracted in a finite time. We explore these findings through an exactly solvable central spin model, wherein a central spin-1/2 system is homogeneously coupled to a bath of identical spins. Further, we show that, upon destroying these unwanted correlations, we boost the rate of both energy extraction and entropy towards their limiting values. We envisage that these studies are relevant for quantum battery research wherein both charging and discharging processes are key to characterizing the battery performance.

TI Experimental demonstration of classical analogous time-dependent
   superposition of states
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB One of the quantum theory concepts on which quantum information processing stands is superposition. Here we provide experimental evidence for the existence of classical analogues to the coherent superposition of energy states, which is made possible by the Hertz-type nonlinearity of the granules together with the external driving field. The granules' nonlinear vibrations are projected into the linear modes of vibration, which depend on one another through the phase and form a coherent superposition. We show that the amplitudes of the coherent states form the components of a state vector that spans a two-dimensional Hilbert space, and time enables the system to span its Hilbert space parametrically. Thus, the superposition of states can be exploited in two-state quantum-like computations without decoherence and wave function collapse. Finally, we demonstrate the experimental realization of applying a reversible Hadamard gate to a pure base state that brings the state into a superposition.

AB Two-dimensional (2D) van der Waals materials have found broad utility in a diverse range of applications including electronics, optoelectronics, renewable energy, and quantum information technologies. Meanwhile, exponentially growing digital data coupled with the ubiquity of artificial intelligence algorithms have generated significant interest in edge neuromorphic computing as an alternative to centralized cloud computing. The drive to incorporate neuroscience principles into computing hardware is motivated by the low power consumption, parallel processing, and reconfigurability of the human brain. The diverse library of 2D materials with atomic-level thicknesses, exceptional electrostatic tunability, and integration versatility is particularly well-suited for realizing bio-realistic synaptic and neuronal functionality. Here, we summarize past and present work in this field and outline the frontier challenges that have not yet been overcome. We also delineate potential solutions and suggest that the neuroscience principles of criticality and synchrony have the potential to inspire breakthrough applications of 2D materials in neuronal computing networks.

SO PHYSICAL REVIEW D
AB Quantum information observables, such as entanglement measures, provide a powerful way to characterize the properties of quantum states. We propose to use them to probe the structure of fundamental interactions and to search for new physics at high energy. Inspired by recent proposals to measure entanglement of top quark pairs produced at the LHC, we examine how higher-dimensional operators in the framework of the Standard Model effective field theory modify the Standard Model expectations. We explore two regions of interest in the phase space where the Standard Model produces maximally entangled states: at threshold and in the high-energy limit. We unveil a nontrivial pattern of effects, which depend on the initial state partons, q (q) over bar or gg, on whether only linear or up to quadratic Standard Model effective field theory contributions are included, and on the phase space region. In general, we find that higher-dimensional effects lower the entanglement predicted in the Standard Model.

TI Metamaterial engineered silicon photonic coupler for whispering gallery
   mode microsphere and disk resonators
SO OPTICA
AB Optical microresonators with high quality factors are key in photonic circuits requiring fine spectral filtering or resonant storage of optical power. Silicon (Si) photonics provides high-performance optoelectronic circuits but yields planar Si microresonators with rather low quality factors (Q < 10(5)). On the other hand, bulk resonators achieve exceptionally high quality factors, Q > 10(7). Si photonic waveguides and bulk resonators have very different sizes and refractive indices that preclude efficient coupling. Here, we show an efficient method to couple bulk resonators and Si waveguides based on subwavelength metamaterial engineering. We demonstrate up to 99% light coupling efficiency for microspheres and microdisks made of silica, lithium niobate, and calcium fluoride, with 0.3 - 3.6 mm diameter. This achievement could enable the heterogeneous integration of bulk resonators and silicon photonic circuits, with potential applications in sensing, communications, and quantum information.

SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Valley pseudospin in transition metal dichalcogenides monolayers intrinsically provides additional possibility to control valley carriers, raising a great impact on valleytronics in following years. The spin-valley locking directly contributes to optical selection rules which allow for valley-dependent addressability of excitons by helical optical pumping. As a binary photonic addressable route, manipulation of valley polarization states is indispensable while effective control methods at deep-subwavelength scale are still limited. Here, we report the excitation and control of valley polarization in h-BN/WSe2/h-BN and Au nanoantenna hybrid structure by electron beam. Near-field circularly polarized dipole modes can be excited via precise stimulation and generate the valley polarized cathodoluminescence via near-field interaction. Effective manipulation of valley polarization degree can be realized by variation of excitation position. This report provides a near-field excitation methodology of valley polarization, which offers exciting opportunities for deep-subwavelength valleytronics investigation, optoelectronic circuits integration and future quantum information technologies.

TI Multimode NOON-state generation with ultracold atoms via geodesic
   counterdiabatic driving
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB We present a protocol for the generation of NOON states with ultracold atoms, leveraging the Bose-Hubbard model in the self-trapping regime. By means of an optimized adiabatic protocol, we achieve a significant reduction in the time required for the preparation of highly entangled NOON states, involving two or more modes. Our method saturates the quantum speed limit, ensuring both efficiency and high fidelity in state preparation. A detailed analysis of the geodesic counterdiabatic driving protocol and its application to the Bose-Hubbard system highlights its ability to expand the energy gap, facilitating faster adiabatic evolution. Through perturbation theory, we derive effective parameters that emulate the counterdiabatic Hamiltonian, enabling experimentally viable implementations with constant physical parameters. This approach is demonstrated to yield exponential time savings compared with standard geodesic driving, making it a powerful tool for creating complex entangled states for applications in quantum metrology and quantum information. Our findings pave the way for scalable and precise quantum state control in ultracold atomic systems.

TI Sensing and Control of Single Trapped Electrons above 1 K
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW X
AB Electrons trapped on the surface of cryogenic substrates (liquid helium, solid neon, or hydrogen) are an emerging platform for quantum information processing made attractive by the inherent purity of the electron environment, the scalability of trapping devices, and the predicted long lifetime of electron spin states. Here we demonstrate the spatial control and detection of single electrons above the surface of liquid helium at temperatures above 1 K. A superconducting coplanar waveguide resonator is used to read out the charge state of an electron trap defined by gate electrodes beneath the helium surface. Dispersive frequency shifts are observed as the trap is loaded with electrons, from several tens down to single electrons. These frequency shifts are in good agreement with our theoretical model that treats each electron as a classical oscillator coupled to the cavity field. This sensitive charge readout scheme can aid efforts to develop largescale quantum processors that require the high cooling powers available in cryostats operating above 1 K.

Specifically, the integration of atomically thin semiconductors with antiferromagnetic two-dimensional materials holds great promise for advancing research. In this work, we successfully demonstrate a new synthesis approach for high-crystallinity CrCl3/MoS2 van der Waals heterostructures via a thermodynamically optimized chemical vapor transport (CVT) process on c-sapphire (0001) substrates. The 2H-MoS2 layers can be grown as monolayers or with varying twist angles whereas the deposition of CrCl3 layers in a second step forms the well-defined heterostructure. Of particular significance are the sharp and clean edges and faces of the crystals, indicating high-quality interfaces in the heterostructures. Raman spectroscopy, AFM and HRTEM confirm the monocrystalline character and precise structure of these layered nanomaterials, in which their intrinsic properties are preserved and unaffected by strain. This can pave the way for next-generation applications, particularly in valleytronics, opto-spintronics, and quantum information processing.

TI Nonreciprocal Superradiant Phase Transitions and Multicriticality in a
   Cavity QED System
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB We demonstrate the emergence of nonreciprocal superradiant phase transitions and novel multicriticality in a cavity quantum electrodynamics system, where a two-level atom interacts with two counterpropagating modes of a whispering-gallery-mode microcavity. The cavity rotates at a certain angular velocity and is directionally squeezed by a unidirectional parametric pumping chi & eth;2 & THORN; nonlinearity. The combination of cavity rotation and directional squeezing leads to nonreciprocal first- and second-order superradiant phase transitions. These transitions do not require ultrastrong atom-field couplings and can be easily controlled by the external pump field. Through a full quantum description of the system Hamiltonian, we identify two types of multicritical points in the phase diagram, both of which exhibit controllable nonreciprocity. These results open a new door for all-optical manipulation of superradiant transitions and multicritical behaviors in light-matter systems, with potential applications in engineering various integrated nonreciprocal quantum devices.

TI Sign switching of superexchange mediated by a few electrons in a
   nonuniform magnetic field br
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Long-range interaction between distant spins is an important building block for the realization of a large quantum-dot network in which couplings between pairs of spins can be selectively addressed. Recent experiments on the coherent oscillation of logical states between remote spins facilitated by intermediate electron states were the first step for large-scale quantum information processing. Reaching this ultimate goal requires extensive studies on the superexchange interaction in different quantum-dot spatial arrangements and electron configurations. Here, we consider a linear triple quantum dot with two antiparallel spins in the outer dots forming the logical states while varying numbers of electrons in the middle dot form a mediator, which facilitates the superexchange interaction. We show that the superexchange is enhanced when the number of mediating electrons increases. In addition, we show that forming a four-electron triplet in the mediator dot further enhances the superexchange strength. Our work can be a guide to scale up the quantum-dot array with controllable and dense connectivity.

TI Frequency-tunable Kerr-free three-wave mixing with a gradiometric SNAIL
SO APPLIED PHYSICS LETTERS
AB Three-wave mixing is a key process in superconducting quantum information processing, being involved in quantum-limited amplification and parametric coupling between superconducting cavities. These operations can be implemented by superconducting nonlinear asymmetric inductive element (SNAIL)-based devices that present a Kerr-free flux-bias point where unwanted parasitic effects, such as Stark shift, are suppressed. However, with a single flux-bias parameter, these circuits can only host one Kerr-free point, limiting the range of their applications. In this Letter, we demonstrate how to overcome this constraint by introducing the gradiometric SNAIL, a doubly flux biased superconducting circuit in which both effective inductance and Kerr coefficient can be independently tuned. Experimental data show the capability of the gradiometric SNAIL to suppress the Kerr effect in a three-wave mixing parametric amplifier over a continuum of flux bias points corresponding to a 1.7 GHz range of operating frequencies.& nbsp;Published under an exclusive license by AIP Publishing.

TI Coherent many-body Rabi oscillations via superradiance and
   superabsorption and the mean-field approach for a superradiant laser
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB The experimental success achieved in recent decades in the coherent manipulation of several Rabi cycles has led to a new stage in the physics of radiation-matter interaction. Motivated by this perspective, we propose here the engineering of coherent many-body Rabi oscillations (CMBROs) induced from the interactions of a moderately dense atomic sample with the environment and a high-finesse cavity mode. The CMBRO follows from the interplay between superradiance and superabsorption: the collective decay and absorption of the atomic sample inside the cavity. The equations we have derived for this interplay, based on the mean-field approximation, describe a two-level superradiant laser in an appropriate parameter regime, and its properties are also discussed. The control of quantum coherence according to the method presented here can be adapted to the implementation of quantum information processes as well as for the investigation of the fundamentals of quantum mechanics.

TI Suppression of the radiation squeezing in interacting quantum Hall edge
   channels
SO NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB We study the quantum fluctuations of the two quadratures of the emitted electromagnetic radiation generated by a quantum Hall device in a quantum point contact geometry. In particular, we focus our attention on the role played by the unavoidable electron-electron interactions between the two edge channels at filling factor two. We investigate quantum features of the emitted microwave radiation, such as squeezing, by studying the current fluctuations at finite frequency, accessible through a two-filters set-up placed just after the quantum point contact. We compare two different drives, respectively a cosine and a train of Lorentzian pulses, used for the injection of the excitations into the system. In both cases quantum features are reduced due to the interactions, however the Lorentzian drive is still characterized by a robust squeezing effect which can have important application on quantum information.

TI Estimation of the Laser Frequency Noise Spectrum by Continuous Dynamical
   Decoupling
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW APPLIED
AB Decoherence induced by laser frequency noise is one of the most important obstacles in quantum information processing. In order to suppress this decoherence, the noise power spectral density needs to be accurately characterized. In particular, the noise spectrum measurement based on the coherence characteristics of qubits would be a meaningful and still challenging method. Here, we theoretically analyze and experimentally obtain the spectrum of laser frequency noise based on the continuous dynamical decoupling technique. We first estimate the mixture-noise (including laser and magnetic noises) spectrum up to (2 pi)530 kHz by monitoring the transverse relaxation from an initial state +X, followed by a gradient descent data process protocol. Then the contribution from the laser noise is extracted by encoding the qubits on different Zeeman sublevels. We also investigate two sufficiently strong noise components by making an analogy between these noises and driving lasers whose linewidth is assumed to be negligible. This method is verified experimentally and finally helps to characterize the noise.

TI Quasiorthogonality of commutative algebras, complex Hadamard matrices,
   and mutually unbiased measurements
SO LINEAR ALGEBRA AND ITS APPLICATIONS
AB We deepen the theory of quasiorthogonal and approximately quasiorthogonal operator algebras through an analysis of the commutative algebra case. We give a new approach to calculate the measure of orthogonality between two such subalgebras of matrices, based on a matrix-theoretic notion we introduce that has a connection to complex Hadamard matrices. We also show how this new tool can yield significant information on the general non-commutative case. We finish by considering quasiorthogonality for the important subclass of commutative algebras that arise from mutually unbiased bases (MUBs) and mutually unbiased measurements (MUMs) in quantum information theory. We present a number of examples throughout the work, including a subclass that arises from group algebras and Latin squares. (c) 2025 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Inc.

TI Infrared beam-shaping on demand via tailored geometric phase
   metasurfaces employing the plasmonic phase-change material
   In3SbTe2
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Conventional optical elements are bulky and limited to specific functionalities, contradicting the increasing demand of miniaturization and multi-functionalities. Optical metasurfaces enable tailoring light-matter interaction at will, especially important for the infrared spectral range which lacks commercially available beam-shaping elements. While the fabrication of those metasurfaces usually requires cumbersome techniques, direct laser writing promises a simple and convenient alternative. Here, we exploit the non-volatile laser-induced insulator-to-metal transition of the plasmonic phase-change material In3SbTe2 (IST) for optical programming of large-area metasurfaces for infrared beam-shaping. We tailor the geometric phase of metasurfaces with rotated crystalline IST rod antennas to achieve beam steering, lensing, and beams carrying orbital angular momenta. Finally, we investigate multi-functional and cascaded metasurfaces exploiting enlarged holography, and design a single metasurface creating two different holograms along the optical axis. Our approach facilitates fabrication of large-area metasurfaces within hours, enabling rapid-prototyping of customized infrared meta-optics for sensing, imaging and quantum information.

TI A teleportation protocol in Schwarzschild-de Sitter space
SO JOURNAL OF HIGH ENERGY PHYSICS
AB We propose a new information transfer protocol for de Sitter space, using black holes as energy reservoirs. We consider antipodal observers in pure de Sitter space in the Bunch-Davis state. They can store Hawking modes from the cosmological horizon in a box. Alternatively, due to thermal fluctuations in de Sitter space, black holes formed through a pair-creation process can be used as energy reservoirs. We focus on the Nariai black hole case, which corresponds to an equilibrium state. Once the black hole is produced, energy pulses can be released into its interior, opening a traversable wormhole. We provide bounds for the amount of information that can be transferred. Specializing in (1+1)-dimensions, we explore how the teleportation protocol leads to an explicit geometric description of the information transmitted through an island region. The protocol uncovers quantum information aspects of de Sitter space, independently of any particular realization of de Sitter space holography.

TI Observation of first- and second-order dissipative phase transitions in
   a two-photon driven Kerr resonator
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB In open quantum systems, dissipative phase transitions (DPTs) emerge from the interplay between unitary evolution, drive, and dissipation. While second-order DPTs have been predominantly investigated theoretically, first-order DPTs have been observed in single-photon-driven Kerr resonators. We present here an experimental and theoretical analysis of both first and second-order DPTs in a two-photon-driven superconducting Kerr resonator. We characterize the steady state at the critical points, showing squeezing below vacuum and the coexistence of phases with different photon numbers. Through time resolved measurements, we study the dynamics across the critical points and observe hysteresis cycles at the first-order DPT and spontaneous symmetry breaking at the second-order DPT. Extracting the timescales of the critical phenomena reveals slowing down across five orders of magnitude when scaling towards the thermodynamic limit. Our results showcase the engineering of criticality in superconducting circuits, advancing the use of parametric resonators for critically-enhanced quantum information applications.

TI Sub-bandgap charge harvesting and energy up-conversion in metal halide
   perovskites: ab initio quantum dynamics
SO NPJ COMPUTATIONAL MATERIALS
AB Metal halide perovskites (MHPs) exhibit unusual properties and complex dynamics. By combining ab initio time-dependent density functional theory, nonadiabatic molecular dynamics and machine learning, we advance quantum dynamics simulation to nanosecond timescale and demonstrate that large fluctuations of MHP defect energy levels extend light absorption to longer wavelengths and enable trapped charges to escape into bands. This allows low energy photons to contribute to photocurrent through energy up-conversion. Deep defect levels can become shallow transiently and vice versa, altering the traditional defect classification into shallow and deep. While defect levels fluctuate more in MHPs than traditional semiconductors, some levels, e.g., Pb interstitials, remain far from band edges, acting as charge recombination centers. Still, many defects deemed detrimental based on static structures, are in fact benign and can contribute to energy up-conversion. The extended light harvesting and energy up-conversion provide strategies for design of novel solar, optoelectronic, and quantum information devices.

TI Unconventional phonon blockade effect in array of three coupled weakly
   nonlinear nanomechanical resonators
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB Phonon antibunching, a phenomenon arising from the quantum statistics of mechanical vibrations, has attracted significant attention due to its potential applications in quantum information processing, sensing, and energy harvesting. Here, we present a comprehensive investigation of phonon antibunching in a system consisting of three weakly nonlinear coupled nanomechanical resonators. We analytically derive and study the antibunching behavior of phonons in the proposed system and bring insight into the underlying mechanisms. The optimal phonon blockade results from destructive quantum interference due to distinct two-phonon excitation pathways. Due to this quantum interference, these unconventional phonon blockade systems can achieve antibunched statistics even in weakly nonlinear regimes, in contrast to conventional phonon blockade systems that require strong nonlinearity. We show that with the inclusion of an additional resonator, there are multiple additional two-phonon excitation pathways compared to two resonator cases, which results in stronger phonon antibunching and supports single phonon for longer duration. These findings are interesting for practical phononics using coupled-resonator systems.

TI Photoionisation detection of a single Er3+ ion with
   sub-100-ns time resolution
SO NATIONAL SCIENCE REVIEW
AB Efficient detection of single optical centres in solids is essential for quantum information processing, sensing and single-photon generation applications. In this work, we use radio-frequency (RF) reflectometry to electrically detect the photoionisation induced by a single Er3+ ion in Si. The high bandwidth and sensitivity of the RF reflectometry provide sub-100-ns time resolution for the photoionisation detection. With this technique, the optically excited state lifetime of a single Er3+ ion in a Si nano-transistor is measured for the first time to be 0.49 +/- 0.04 mu s. Our results demonstrate an efficient approach for detecting a charge state change induced by Er excitation and relaxation. This approach could be used for fast readout of other single optical centres in solids and is attractive for large-scale integrated optical quantum systems thanks to the multi-channel RF reflectometry demonstrated with frequency multiplexing techniques.

TI Interference in Quantum Field Theory: Detecting Ghosts with Phases
SO ANNALEN DER PHYSIK
AB This study discusses the implications of the principle of locality for interference in quantum field theory. As an example, it considers the interaction of two charges via a mediating quantum field and the resulting interference pattern in the Lorenz gauge. Using the Heisenberg picture, it is proposed that detecting relative phases or entanglement between two charges in an interference experiment is equivalent to accessing empirically the gauge degrees of freedom associated with the so-called ghost (scalar) modes of the field in the Lorenz gauge. These results imply that ghost modes are measurable and hence physically relevant, contrary to what is usually thought. They also raise interesting questions about the relation between the principle of locality and the principle of gauge-invariance. This analysis also applies to linearized quantum gravity in the harmonic gauge, and hence has implications for the recently proposed entanglement-based witnesses of non-classicality in gravity.

TI Selective Area Growth of PbTe Nanowire Networks on InP
SO ADVANCED FUNCTIONAL MATERIALS
AB Hybrid semiconductor-superconductor nanowires are promising candidates as quantum information processing devices. The need for scalability and complex designs calls for the development of selective area growth techniques. Here, the growth of large scale lead telluride (PbTe) networks is introduced by molecular beam epitaxy. The group IV-VI lead-salt semiconductor is an attractive material choice due to its large dielectric constant, strong spin-orbit coupling, and high carrier mobility. A crystal re-orientation process during the initial growth stages leads to single crystalline nanowire networks despite a large lattice mismatch, different crystal structure, and diverging thermal expansion coefficient to the indium phosphide (InP) substrate. The high quality of the resulting material is confirmed by Hall bar measurements, indicating mobilities up to 5600 cm(2) (Vs)(-1), and Aharonov-Bohm experiments, indicating a low-temperature phase coherence length exceeding 21 mu m. Together, these properties show the high potential of the system as a basis for topological networks.

TI Highly efficient, ultra-compact, and ultra-broadband bidirectional
   vertical coupler based on spin-directional locking
SO JOURNAL OF THE OPTICAL SOCIETY OF AMERICA B-OPTICAL PHYSICS
AB An ultra-compact and ultra-broadband polarization-selective bidirectional vertical coupler is proposed. The coupler is designed by coupling unique two-plane chiral pi-shaped plasmonic nanoantennas on top of a silicon-on-insulator waveguide. By taking advantage of the spin-directional locking principle and coupled nanoantennas, a circularly polarized incident light can be coupled into a specific direction through the waveguide, depending on its spin. Based on the full-vectorial finite element method, for a beam radius of 0.53 mu m, the coupler with a size of 1.07 x 0.5 mu m(2) provides maximum coupling efficiency and an extinction coefficient of 6.9 dB and 16.9dB across the telecommunication C to U bands, respectively, with a 2 dB bandwidth of >160 nm. The proposed coupler has potential applications in telecommunications, vertical cross-chip communications, and quantum information processing. (c) 2022 Optica Publishing Group

TI GHZ states as near-optimal states for reference frame alignment
SO QUANTUM INFORMATION PROCESSING
AB Let two coordinate systems, in possession of Alice and Bob, be related to each other by an unknown rotation R is an element of SO(3). Alice is to send identical states vertical bar psi 0  to Bob who will make measurements on the received state and will determine the rotation R. The task of Bob is to estimate these parameters of the rotation R by the best possible measurements. Based on the quantum Fisher information, we show that Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) states are near optimal states for this task. We show concrete measurements which will allow Bob to determine the rotation R. This shows that GHZ states, as superposition of macroscopically distinct states, are useful in yet another context in quantum information, namely in communicating the information of a whole coordinate system between two parties where no prior information is available on the relative orientation of the two frames.

TI Resource theory of imaginarity: Quantification and state conversion
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Complex numbers are widely used in both classical and quantum physics and are indispensable components for describing quantum systems and their dynamical behavior. Recently, the resource theory of imaginarity has been introduced, allowing for a systematic study of complex numbers in quantum mechanics and quantum information theory. In this work we develop theoretical methods for the resource theory of imaginarity, motivated by recent progress within theories of entanglement and coherence. We investigate imaginarity quantification, focusing on the geometric imaginarity and the robustness of imaginarity, and apply these tools to the state conversion problem in imaginarity theory. Moreover, we analyze the complexity of real and general operations in optical experiments, focusing on the number of unfixed wave plates for their implementation. We also discuss the role of imaginarity for local state discrimination, proving that any pair of real orthogonal pure states can be discriminated via local real operations and classical communication. Our study reveals the significance of complex numbers in quantum physics and proves that imaginarity is a resource in optical experiments.

TI Efficient all-optical modulator based on a periodic dielectric atomic
   lattice
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB All-optical devices used to process optical signals without electro-optical conversion plays a vital role in the next generation of optical information processing systems. We demonstrate an efficient all-optical modulator that utilizes a periodic dielectric atomic lattice produced in a gas of Rb-85 vapor. Four orders of diffraction patterns are observed when a probe laser is passed through the lattice. The frequency shift of the peak of each diffraction order can be tuned by adjusting the control laser power and two-photon detuning, enabling this device to be used as a multi-channel all-optical modulator. Both theoretical simulations and experimental results demonstrate that this modulator can operate over a frequency band extending from about 0 to 60 MHz. This work may pave the way for studying quantum information processing and quantum networking proposed in atomic ensembles.

TI Generation and dynamics of entangled fermion-photon-phonon states in
   nanocavities
SO NANOPHOTONICS
AB We develop the analytic theory describing the formation and evolution of entangled quantum states for a fermionic quantum emitter coupled simultaneously to a quantized electromagnetic field in a nanocavity and quantized phonon or mechanical vibrational modes. The theory is applicable to a broad range of cavity quantum optomechanics problems and emerging research on plasmonic nanocavities coupled to single molecules and other quantum emitters. The optimal conditions for a tripartite entanglement are realized near the parametric resonances in a coupled system. The model includes dissipation and decoherence effects due to coupling of the fermion, photon, and phonon subsystems to their dissipative reservoirs within the stochastic evolution approach, which is derived from the Heisenberg-Langevin formalism. Our theory provides analytic expressions for the time evolution of the quantum state and observables and the emission spectra. The limit of a classical acoustic pumping and the interplay between parametric and standard one-photon resonances are analyzed.

TI Light-driven modulation of proximity-enhanced functionalities in hybrid
   nano-scale systems
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Advancing quantum information and communication technology requires smaller and faster components with actively controllable functionalities. This work presents an all-optical strategy for dynamically modulating magnetic properties via proximity effects controlled by light. We demonstrate this concept using hybrid nanoscale systems composed of C-6(0) molecules proximitized to a cobalt metallic ferromagnetic surface, where proximity interactions are particularly strong. Our findings show that by inducing excitons in the C60 molecules with resonant ultrashort light pulses, we can significantly modify the interaction at the Cobalt/C60 interface, leading to a remarkable 60% transient shift in the frequency of the Co dipolar ferromagnetic resonance mode. This effect, detected via a specifically designed time-resolved Magneto-Optical Kerr Effect (tr-MOKE) experiment, persists on a timescale of hundreds of picoseconds. Since this frequency shift directly correlates with a transient change in the anisotropy field-an essential parameter for technological applications-our findings establish a new material platform for ultrafast optical control of magnetism at the nanoscale.

TI Quantum Tunneling of the Magnetization in Systems with Anisotropic 4f
   Ion Pairs: Rates from Low-Temperature Zero-Field Relaxation
SO ACS OMEGA
AB Anisotropic open shell 4f ions have magnetic moments that can be read and written as atomic bits. If it comes to quantum applications where the phase of the wave function has to be written, controlled, and read, it is advantageous to rely on more than one atom that carries the quantum information on the system because states with different susceptibilities may be addressed. Such systems are realized for pairs of lanthanides in single-molecule magnets, where four pseudospin states are found and mixed in quantum tunneling processes. For the case of endohedral fullerenes like Dy2S@C-82 or Tb2ScN@C-80, the quantum tunneling of the magnetization is imprinted in the magnetization lifetimes at sub-Kelvin temperatures. A (4 x 4) Hamiltonian that includes quantum tunneling of the magnetization and the dipole and exchange interaction between the two lanthanide magnetic moments predicts the lifting of the zero-field ground state degeneracy and nonlinear coupling to magnetic fields in such systems.

TI Demonstration of machine-learning-enhanced Bayesian quantum state
   estimation
SO NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB Machine learning (ML) has found broad applicability in quantum information science in topics as diverse as experimental design, state classification, and even studies on quantum foundations. Here, we experimentally realize an approach for defining custom prior distributions that are automatically tuned using ML for Bayesian quantum state estimation methods that generally better conform to the physical properties of the underlying system than standard fixed prior distributions. Previously, researchers have looked to Bayesian quantum state tomography for advantages like uncertainty quantification, the return of reliable estimates under any measurement condition, and minimal mean-squared error. However, practical challenges related to long computation times and conceptual issues concerning how to incorporate prior knowledge most suitably can overshadow these benefits. Using both simulated and experimental measurement results, we demonstrate that ML-defined prior distributions reduce net convergence times and provide a natural way to incorporate both implicit and explicit information directly into the prior distribution. These results constitute a promising path toward practical implementations of Bayesian quantum state tomography.

TI Identification of an Oxygen Defect in Hexagonal Boron Nitride
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY LETTERS
AB Paramagnetic fluorescent defects in two-dimensional hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) are promising building blocks for quantum information processing. Although numerous defect-related single-photon sources and a few quantum bits have been found, except for the boron vacancy, their identification is still elusive. Here, we demonstrate that the comparison of experimental and first-principles simulated electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectra is a powerful tool for defect identification in hBN, and first-principles modeling is inevitable in this process as a result of the dense nuclear spin environment of hBN. In particular, a recently observed EPR center is associated with the negatively charged oxygen vacancy complex by means of the many-body perturbation theory method on top of hybrid density functional calculations. To our surprise, the negatively charged oxygen vacancy complex produces a coherent emission around 2 eV with a well-reproducing previously recorded photoluminescence spectrum of some quantum emitters, according to our calculations.

TI Quantum thermodynamics under continuous monitoring: A general framework
SO AVS QUANTUM SCIENCE
AB The thermodynamics of quantum systems driven out of equilibrium has attracted increasing attention in the last decade, in connection with quantum information and statistical physics, and with a focus on non-classical signatures. While a first approach can deal with average thermodynamics quantities over ensembles, in order to establish the impact of quantum and environmental fluctuations during the evolution, a continuous quantum measurement of the open system is required. Here, we provide an introduction to the general theoretical framework to establish and interpret the thermodynamics for quantum systems whose nonequilibrium evolution is continuously monitored. We review the formalism of quantum trajectories and its consistent application to the thermodynamic scenario, where primary quantities such as work, heat, and entropy production can be defined at the stochastic level. The connection to irreversibility and fluctuation theorems is also discussed together with some recent developments, and we provide some simple examples to illustrate the general theoretical framework.

   from the Extreme Ultraviolet to the Far Infrared
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB We present a theoretical demonstration on the generation of entangled coherent states and of coherent state superpositions, with photon numbers and frequencies orders of magnitude higher than those provided by the current technology. This is achieved by utilizing a quantum mechanical multimode description of the single-and two-color intense laser field driven process of high harmonic generation in atoms. It is found that all field modes involved in the high harmonic generation process are entangled, and upon performing a quantum operation, lead to the generation of high photon number optical cat states spanning from the far infrared to the extreme ultraviolet spectral region. This provides direct insights into the quantum mechanical properties of the optical field in the intense laser matter interaction. Finally, these states can be considered as a new resource for fundamental tests of quantum theory, quantum information processing, or sensing with nonclassical states of light.

TI Dynamics and redistribution of entanglement and coherence in three

SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEOMETRIC METHODS IN MODERN PHYSICS
AB We study the dynamics and redistribution of entanglement and coherence in three time-dependent coupled harmonic oscillators. We resolve the Schrodinger equation by using time-dependent Euler rotation together with a linear quench model to obtain the state of vacuum solution. Such state can be translated to the phase space picture to determine the Wigner distribution. We show that its Gaussian matrix G(t) can be used to directly cast the covariance matrix sigma(t). To quantify the mixedness and entanglement of the state, one uses respectively linear and von Neumann entropies for three cases: fully symmetric, bi-symmetric and fully nonsymmetric. Then we determine the coherence, tripartite entanglement and local uncertainties and derive their dynamics. We show that the dynamics of all quantum information quantities are driven by the Ermakov modes. Finally, we use an homodyne detection to redistribute both resources of entanglement and coherence.

TI Quantum Aitchison geometry
SO INFINITE DIMENSIONAL ANALYSIS QUANTUM PROBABILITY AND RELATED TOPICS
AB Multiplying a likelihood function with a positive number makes no difference in Bayesian statistical inference, therefore after normalization the likelihood function in many cases can be considered as probability distribution. This idea led Aitchison to define a vector space structure on the probability simplex in 1986. Pawlowsky-Glahn and Egozcue gave a statistically relevant scalar product on this space in 2001, endowing the probability simplex with a Hilbert space structure. In this paper, we present the noncommutative counterpart of this geometry. We introduce a real Hilbert space structure on the quantum mechanical finite dimensional state space. We show that the scalar product in quantum setting respects the tensor product structure and can be expressed in terms of modular operators and Hamilton operators. Using the quantum analogue of the log-ratio transformation, it turns out that all the newly introduced operations emerge naturally in the language of Gibbs states. We show an orthonormal basis in the state space and study the introduced geometry on the space of qubits in details.

TI Quantum stochastic resonance in a single-photon emitter
SO COMMUNICATIONS PHYSICS
AB Stochastic resonance is a phenomenon in which fluctuations enhance an otherwise weak signal. It has been found in many different systems in paleoclimatology, biology, medicine, and physics. The classical stochastic resonance due to thermal noise has recently been experimentally extended to the quantum regime, where the fundamental randomness of individual quantum events provides the noise source. Here, we demonstrate quantum stochastic resonance in the single-electron tunneling dynamics of a periodically driven single-photon emitter, consisting of a self-assembled quantum dot that is tunnel-coupled to an electron reservoir. Such highly-controllable quantum emitters are promising candidates for future applications in quantum information technologies. We monitor the charge dynamics by resonant optical excitation and identify quantum stochastic resonance with the help of full counting statistics of tunneling events in terms of the Fano factor and extend the statistical evaluation to factorial cumulants to gain a deeper understanding of this far-reaching phenomenon.

AB Massive quantum oscillators are finding increasing applications in proposals for high-precision quantum sensors and interferometric detection of weak forces. Although optimal estimation of certain properties of massive quantum oscillators such as phase shifts and displacements have strict counterparts in the theory of quantum estimation of the electromagnetic field, the phase space anisotropy of the massive oscillator is characterized by a length scale parameter that is an independent target for quantum estimation methods. We show that displaced squeezed states and excited eigenstates of a massive oscillator exhibit Heisenberg scaling of the quantum Fisher information for the length scale with respect to excitation number, and discuss asymptotically unbiased and efficient estimation allowing to achieve the predicted sensitivity. We construct a sequence of entangled states of two massive oscillators that provides a boost in length scale sensitivity equivalent to appending a third massive oscillator to a non-entangled system, and a state of N oscillators exhibiting Heisenberg scaling with respect to the total energy.

TI Feedback-assisted quantum nondemolition measurement in an
   atom-light-correlated interferometer
SO NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB Quantum nondemolition (QND) measurement plays an essential role in quantum optics and quantum information. Here, a feedback-assisted atom-light-correlated interferometer (FALCI) is proposed and applied to the QND measurement of photon number, in which the phase of the probe acquires information about the photon number of the signal without perturbing it due to the AC-Stark effect. A beam splitter with adjustable reflectivity is employed as a feedback controller to enhance the performance of QND measurement. The FALCI harnesses interference between quantum-correlated atoms and light to perform the measurement. It is found that the quantum correlation can be enhanced by manipulating the feedback ratio. Furthermore, the QND measurement sensitivity is theoretically studied via homodyne detection. It is demonstrated that the FALCI can achieve the sensitivity enhancement with suitable feedback ratio. For the lossy case, feedback control can mitigate the effect of losses on the sensitivity.

TI Distinct Mechanisms of Triplet Pair Decay in Amorphous and Crystalline
   Heteroacene Thin Films
SO CHEMPHOTOCHEM
AB Triplet pairs (TT) in crystalline molecular semiconductors have unique spin properties of interest for quantum information or enhancing solar photoconversion. The population and diffusion dynamics of TT have been the subject of recent studies, both in covalent dimers and in crystalline systems. Here, we monitor the triplet population in neat polycrystalline and amorphous films of a heteroacene with known TT spectral properties and tunable spin polarization depending on the intermolecular geometry. Transient measurements reveal an anomalous power dependence in polycrystalline films that we attribute to the fast diffusion and interaction of dissociated triplet pairs confined to one-dimensional stacks of strongly coupled molecules. The nongeminate triplet interaction after dephasing facilitates conversion to the triplet 3TT and eventually T1+S0. Amorphous films have no power dependence and proceed directly from 1TT to 3TT and subsequently T1+S0 via state mixing facilitated by nonparallel geometries and weak exchange coupling.

TI Discrete Entropies of Chebyshev Polynomials
SO MATHEMATICS
AB Because of its flexibility and multiple meanings, the concept of information entropy in its continuous or discrete form has proven to be very relevant in numerous scientific branches. For example, it is used as a measure of disorder in thermodynamics, as a measure of uncertainty in statistical mechanics as well as in classical and quantum information science, as a measure of diversity in ecological structures and as a criterion for the classification of races and species in population dynamics. Orthogonal polynomials are a useful tool in solving and interpreting differential equations. Lately, this subject has been intensively studied in many areas. For example, in statistics, by using orthogonal polynomials to fit the desired model to the data, we are able to eliminate collinearity and to seek the same information as simple polynomials. In this paper, we consider the Tsallis, Kaniadakis and Varma entropies of Chebyshev polynomials of the first kind and obtain asymptotic expansions. In the particular case of quadratic entropies, there are given concrete computations.

TI Characterization of Two Fast-Turnaround Dry Dilution Refrigerators for
   Scanning Probe Microscopy
SO JOURNAL OF LOW TEMPERATURE PHYSICS
AB Low-temperature scanning probe microscopes (SPMs) are critical for the study of quantum materials and quantum information science. Due to the rising costs of helium, cryogen-free cryostats have become increasingly desirable. However, they typically suffer from comparatively worse vibrations than cryogen-based systems, necessitating the understanding and mitigation of vibrations for SPM applications. Here we demonstrate the construction of two cryogen-free dilution refrigerator SPMs with minimal modifications to the factory default and we systematically characterize their vibrational performance. We measure the absolute vibrations at the microscope stage with geophones and use both microwave impedance microscopy and a scanning single-electron transistor to independently measure tip-sample vibrations. Additionally, we implement customized filtering and thermal anchoring schemes and characterize the cooling power at the scanning stage and the tip electron temperature. This work serves as a reference to researchers interested in cryogen-free SPMs, as such characterization is not standardized in the literature or available from manufacturers.

TI Quantum control of exciton wave functions in 2D semiconductors
SO SCIENCE ADVANCES
AB Excitons-bound electron-hole pairs-play a central role in light-matter interaction phenomena and are crucial for wide-ranging applications from light harvesting and generation to quantum information processing. A long-standing challenge in solid-state optics has been to achieve precise and scalable control over excitonic motion. We present a technique using nanostructured gate electrodes to create tailored potential landscapes for excitons in 2D semiconductors, enabling in situ wave function shaping at the nanoscale. Our approach forms electrostatic traps for excitons in various geometries, such as quantum dots, rings, and arrays thereof. We show independent spectral tuning of spatially separated quantum dots, achieving degeneracy despite material disorder. Owing to the strong light-matter coupling of excitons in 2D semiconductors, we observe unambiguous signatures of confined exciton wave functions in optical reflection and photoluminescence measurements. This work unlocks possibilities for engineering exciton dynamics and interactions at the nanometer scale, with implications for optoelectronic devices, topological photonics, and quantum nonlinear optics.

TI Reconstructing black hole exteriors and interiors using entanglement and
   complexity
SO JOURNAL OF HIGH ENERGY PHYSICS
AB Based on the AdS/CFT correspondence, we study how to reconstruct bulk spacetime metrics by various quantum information measures on the boundary field theories, which include entanglement entropy, mutual information, entanglement of purification, and computational complexity according to the proposals of complexity=volume 2.0 and complexity=generalized volume. We present several reconstruction methods, all of which are free of UV divergence and most of which are driven by the derivatives of the measures with respect to the boundary scales. We illustrate that the exterior and interior of a black hole can be reconstructed using the measures of spatial entanglement and time-evolved complexity, respectively. We find that these measures always probe the spacetime in a local way: reconstructing the bulk metric in different radial positions requires the information at different boundary scales. We also show that the reconstruction method using complexity=volume 2.0 is the simplest and has a certain strong locality.

TI Tunable directional photon scattering from a pair of superconducting
   qubits
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB The two frequency-modulated superconducting qubits act as a trembling mirror for microwave photons with on-demand tunable directionality.
   The ability to control the direction of scattered light is crucial to provide flexibility and scalability for a wide range of on-chip applications, such as integrated photonics, quantum information processing, and nonlinear optics. Tunable directionality can be achieved by applying external magnetic fields that modify optical selection rules, by using nonlinear effects, or interactions with vibrations. However, these approaches are less suitable to control microwave photon propagation inside integrated superconducting quantum devices. Here, we demonstrate on-demand tunable directional scattering based on two periodically modulated transmon qubits coupled to a transmission line at a fixed distance. By changing the relative phase between the modulation tones, we realize unidirectional forward or backward photon scattering. Such an in-situ switchable mirror represents a versatile tool for intra- and inter-chip microwave photonic processors. In the future, a lattice of qubits can be used to realize topological circuits that exhibit strong nonreciprocity or chirality.

TI Robust method for certifying genuine high-dimensional quantum steering
   with multimeasurement settings
SO OPTICA
AB Genuine high-dimensional (HD) quantum steering was recently proposed for certifying HD entanglement in the onesided device-independent setting, as quantified by the Schmidt number [Phys. Rev. Lett. 126, 200404 (2021)]. As one of the central challenges in the steering test is the tolerated noise threshold, here we develop a more robust method for certifying genuineHDsteering in noisy environments. We derive genuineHDsteering criteria using multiple mutually unbiased bases, surpassing the previous restriction of only two measurement settings. Although the present multisetting criteria are not tight, we theoretically show that they are more robust to noise than the tight two-setting criteria. To test the practicality of our method under realistic conditions, we report an experimental demonstration using photonic orbital angular momentum entangled states in dimensions d = 3, 4, 5. Our work offers a more robust way to witness the entanglement dimension in practical one-sided device-independent quantum information processing.

TI High-dimensional discrete Fourier transform gates with a quantum
   frequency processor
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB The discrete Fourier transform (DFT) is of fundamental interest in photonic quantum information, yet the ability to scale it to high dimensions depends heavily on the physical encoding, with practical recipes lacking in emerging platforms such as frequency bins. In this article, we show that d-point frequency-bin DFTs can be realized with a fixed three-component quantum frequency processor (QFP), simply by adding to the electro-optic modulation signals one radio-frequency harmonic per each incremental increase in d. We verify gate fidelity F-W>0.9997 and success probability P-W>0.965 up to d = 10 in numerical simulations, and experimentally implement the solution for d = 3, utilizing measurements with parallel DFTs to quantify entanglement and perform tomography of multiple two-photon frequency-bin states. Our results furnish new opportunities for high-dimensional frequency-bin protocols in quantum communications and networking.

TI A Novel Approach to the Partial Information Decomposition
SO ENTROPY
AB We consider the "partial information decomposition" (PID) problem, which aims to decompose the information that a set of source random variables provide about a target random variable into separate redundant, synergistic, union, and unique components. In the first part of this paper, we propose a general framework for constructing a multivariate PID. Our framework is defined in terms of a formal analogy with intersection and union from set theory, along with an ordering relation which specifies when one information source is more informative than another. Our definitions are algebraically and axiomatically motivated, and can be generalized to domains beyond Shannon information theory (such as algorithmic information theory and quantum information theory). In the second part of this paper, we use our general framework to define a PID in terms of the well-known Blackwell order, which has a fundamental operational interpretation. We demonstrate our approach on numerous examples and show that it overcomes many drawbacks associated with previous proposals.

TI Numerical Engineering of Robust Adiabatic Operations
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW APPLIED
AB Adiabatic operations are powerful tools for robust quantum control in numerous fields of physics, chemistry, and quantum information science. The inherent robustness due to adiabaticity can, however, be impaired in applications requiring short evolution times. We present a single versatile gradient-based optimization protocol that combines adiabatic control with effective Hamiltonian engineering in order to design adiabatic operations tailored to the specific imperfections and resources of an experimental setup. The practicality of the protocol is demonstrated by engineering a fast, 2.3 Rabi cycle-long adiabatic inversion pulse for magnetic resonance with built-in robustness to Rabi field inhomogeneities and resonance offsets. The performance and robustness of the pulse is validated in a nanoscale force-detected magnetic resonance experiment on a solid-state sample, indicating an ensemble-averaged inversion accuracy of 99.997%. We further showcase the utility of our protocol by providing examples of adiabatic pulses robust to spin-spin interactions, parameter-selective operations, and operations connecting arbitrary states, each motivated by experiments.

TI Surface-acoustic-wave-controlled optomechanically induced transparency
   in a hybrid piezo-optomechanical planar distributed
   Bragg-reflector-cavity system
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB We propose a scheme that can generate tunable optomechanically induced transparency in a hybrid piezo-optomechanical cavity system. The system is composed of a high-quality planar distributed Bragg reflector cavity modified with an embedded Gaussian-shaped defect. Moreover, interdigitated transducers are fabricated on the surface of the cavity to generate surface acoustic waves. Under the actuation of the surface acoustic wave, the upper Bragg mirrors can be vibrated as a bulk acoustic resonator, and the distributed Bragg reflector cavity becomes a standard three-level optomechanical system. In this situation, we show that when a strong pump optical field and a weak probe optical field are simultaneously applied to the hybrid optomechanical cavity system, optomechanically induced transparency occurs under the quantum interference between different energy-level pathways. Our scheme can be applied in the fields of optical switches and quantum information processing in solid-state quantum systems.

TI Deformed Octonacci photonic crystal made of modified polyvinyl alcohol
   films with hybrid AgAlO2 nanoparticles for slowing optical signals
SO AIN SHAMS ENGINEERING JOURNAL
AB A high slowdown factor (SDF) of optical signals is achieved using an optimized and geometrically deformed quasi-periodic Octonacci photonic structure. Modified polyvinyl alcohol doped with 2.0 wt% AgAlO2 nanoparticles and pure polyvinyl alcohol are employed as the two constituent materials. The transfer matrix method and finite element method are utilized to determine the optical properties and the SDF for TE and TM polarization modes. The Octonacci distribution significantly influences the propagation speed of light. Increasing the optical thickness of the layers enhances the SDF. Further improvements are observed by applying geometric deformation to the layer thicknesses. A maximum SDF of 226.29 is obtained when the Octonacci sequence is set at the 7th iteration, the reference wavelength (lambda 0) is 1.5 mu m, and the deformation degree (h) is 0.1. The results are compared with previous studies. The proposed structure shows potential for applications in optical telecommunications, sensing, and quantum information processing.

TI Kullback-Leibler divergence as a measure of irreversible information
   loss near black hole horizons
SO EUROPEAN PHYSICAL JOURNAL PLUS
AB We present a unified theoretical framework that integrates information theory, thermodynamics, and general relativity to analyze the fundamental limit of decoding time-encoded signals in curved spacetime. In particular, we introduce the Kullback-Leibler divergence (KLD) as a quantitative measure of the mismatch between the transmitted and received symbol distributions induced by gravitational time dilation. Using a minimal communication model, we derive the critical radius at which information decoding becomes thermodynamically impossible due to the divergence of the KLD. We show that this radius approaches the Schwarzschild horizon in the limit where the information entropy cost becomes negligible relative to the transmission energy. This result provides a novel information-theoretic interpretation of the event horizon as a boundary of irreversible information loss governed by universal thermodynamic principles. Our framework offers new insights into the entropic and energetic constraints on communication in strong gravitational fields and may extend to general relativistic and quantum information settings.

TI Coherent population trapping for reservoir engineering and spin
   squeezing
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Spin squeezing has important applications in the field of quantum metrology and quantum information processing. Here we propose that coherent population trapping is well suitable for establishing cavity dissipation mechanism and generating a spin-squeezed state. An ensemble of N double A-type atoms is placed inside the two-mode optical cavity, where one A subsystem is driven resonantly by two strong control fields to form a dark resonance and the other A subsystem is coupled by two cavity vacuum fields and two external fields with large detunings. Due to the dark resonance, the atoms are trapped in a dark state and one has the maximal coherence between the two ground states. Two double off-resonance stimulated Raman scattering interactions are induced between fields and dressed atoms to establish a dissipative quantum dynamical process based on a collective cavity reservoir. As a result, strong stable spin squeezing is generated, which is verified by our numerical and analytical results.

TI A synthetic moving-envelope metasurface antenna for independent control
   of arbitrary harmonic orders
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Flexible frequency controls are crucial in many photonic and electronic applications, ranging from communications systems, spectroscopy, and metrology to quantum information processing. However, the state-of-the-art solutions based on nonlinear bulk media, electro-optic effect, and nonlinear metasurfaces incur very limited spectral controllability, and merely a couple of harmonic orders can be independently manipulated. Here, we theoretically propose and experimentally demonstrate synthetic moving-envelope metasurface antennas capable of simultaneously generating arbitrary harmonic orders and independently manipulating their wave properties in a software-defined manner. As proof-of-principle examples, we demonstrate unidirectional frequency transition, frequency comb generation, arbitrary harmonic orders independent control, and their applications in frequency-division multiplexing communications. All these complicated functionalities are achieved by the 1-bit spatiotemporally ON-OFF switching of meta-atoms of the waveguide-integrated metasurface antenna. Our proposed synthetic metasurface antenna solution greatly expands the frontiers of wave engineering and information manipulation, showing promising potential in wireless communications, spectroscopy, metrology, and quantum science.

TI Unambiguous joint detection of spatially separated properties of a
   single photon in the two arms of an interferometer
SO COMMUNICATIONS PHYSICS
AB The quantum superposition principle implies that a particle entering an interferometer evolves by simultaneously taking both arms. If a non-destructive, minimally-disturbing interaction coupling a particle property to a pointer is implemented on each arm while maintaining the path superposition, quantum theory predicts that, for a fixed state measured at the output port, certain particle properties can be associated with only one or the other path. This phenomenon is known as the quantum Cheshire cat effect. Here we report the realization of this prediction through joint observation of the spatial and polarization degrees of freedom of a single photon in the two respective arms of an interferometer. Significant pointer shifts ( similar to 50 microns), corresponding to measured weak values, are observed in each arm. This observation, involving coupling distinct properties of a quantum system in spatially separated regions, opens new possibilities for quantum information protocols and for tests of quantumness for mesoscopic systems.

TI Chirality-modulated photonic spin Hall effect in PT-symmetry
SO NANOPHOTONICS
AB The photonic spin Hall effect (PSHE), featured by a spin-dependent shift driven by its polarization handedness, is proposed to facilitate the applications in precision metrology and quantum information processing. Here, due to the magnetoelectric coupling of the chirality, the PSHE is accompanied with Goos-Hanchen and Imbert-Fedorov effects. Taking advantage of this superiority, the transverse shift (TS) and longitudinal shift (LS) can be applied simultaneously. Rearranging the PT-symmetric scattering matrix, the responsive PSHE near the exceptional points and their basic physical mechanisms are discussed in detail in the case of complex chirality kappa. Re[kappa] and Im[kappa] regulated the rich (at multi-angle), gaint (reach upper limit) and tunable (magnitude and direction) TS and LS, respectively. Based on the chirality-modulated PSHE, the novel applications in binary code conversion and barcode encryption are proposed systematically. By incorporating the quantum weak measurement technology, our applications provide new mechanisms to realize optoelectronic communication.

TI Attoscience in phase space
SO EUROPEAN PHYSICAL JOURNAL D
AB We provide a brief review of how phase space techniques are explored within strong-field and attosecond science. This includes a broad overview of the existing landscape, with focus on strong-field ionisation and rescattering, high-order harmonic generation, stabilisation and free-electron lasers. Furthermore, using our work on the subject, which deals with ionisation dynamics in atoms and diatomic molecules as well as high-order harmonic generation in inhomogeneous fields, we exemplify how such tools can be employed. One may for instance determine qualitatively different phase space dynamics, explore how bifurcations influence ionisation and high-harmonic generation, establish for which regimes classical and quantum correspondence works or fails, and what role different timescales play. Finally, we conclude the review highlighting the importance of the tools available in quantum optics, quantum information and physical chemistry to strong-field laser-matter interaction.

TI Prospects for sub-nanometer scale imaging of optical phenomena using
   electron microscopy
SO APPLIED PHYSICS LETTERS
AB Imaging of optical phenomena at the sub-nanometer scale can offer fundamental insights into the electronic or vibrational states in atomic-scale defects, molecules, and nanoparticles, which are important in quantum information, heterogeneous catalysis, optoelectronics, and structural biology. Several techniques have surpassed the traditional Abbe diffraction limit and attained spatial resolutions down to a few nanometers, but sub-nanometer scale optics has remained elusive. Here, we propose an approach that combines spectrally specific photoabsorption with sub-nanometer scale resolution transmission electron microscopy (TEM) of photoexcited electrons. We first estimate the signal level and conditions required for imaging nanoscale optical phenomena in core-shell quantum dots (QDs) like CdS/CdTe. Furthermore, we show the possibility of imaging photoexcited states of atomic-scale defects in a monolayer hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) using ab initio and high resolution (HR)TEM simulations. The ability to directly visualize photoexcited states at the sub-nanometer scale opens opportunities to study properties of individual quantum dots and atomic defects.

TI Optimized Spectral Purity of Heralded Single Photons at the Telecom
   O-Band
SO ADVANCED PHYSICS RESEARCH
AB We report on optimizing the spectral purity of heralded single photons in the telecom O-band, where single photons can be propagated with low loss and low dispersion in a standard telecom optical fiber. We numerically searched for various group-velocity-matching conditions and corresponding optimal poling structures of a potassium titanyl phosphate crystal for spontaneous parametric downconversion. Our poling optimization results using phase-matching coherence-length and sub-coherence-length modulation schemes show % spectral purity with pump wavelengths ranging from 603.8 to 887.3 nm. Some optimized configurations are feasible with off-the-shelf lasers and single-photon detectors. Moreover, by investigating noise photon spectra for different poling optimization methods, we show that, in practice, appropriate, gentle spectral filtering helps achieve high purity. This study will pave the way for developing practical quantum sources for quantum information applications at the telecom O-band.

TI Keeping the photon in the dark: Enabling quantum dot dark state control
   by chirped pulses and magnetic fields
SO SCIENCE ADVANCES
AB Dark excitons in quantum dots are not directly optically accessible, which has limited their use in practical applications. Nevertheless, they offer promising features such as substantially longer lifetimes compared to bright excitons, making them attractive candidates for quantum information processing. While previous theoretical and experimental studies have explored their potential, their full capabilities remain largely untapped. In this work, we demonstrate an all-optical storage and retrieval of the spin-forbidden dark exciton in a quantum dot from the ground state using chirped pulses and an in-plane magnetic field. Our experimental findings are in excellent agreement with theoretical predictions of the dynamics calculated using state-of-the-art product tensor methods. Our scheme enables an all-optical control of dark states without relying on any preceding decays. This opens up an unexplored dimension for optimal quantum control and time-bin entangled photon pair generation from quantum dots.

TI Evidence-Based Certification of Quantum Dimensions
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB Identifying a reasonably small Hilbert space that completely describes an unknown quantum state is crucial for efficient quantum information processing. We introduce a general dimension-certification protocol for both discrete and continuous variables that is fully evidence based, relying solely on the experimental data collected and no other unjustified assumptions whatsoever. Using the Bayesian concept of relative belief, we take the effective dimension of the state as the smallest one such that the posterior probability is larger than the prior, as dictated by the data. The posterior probabilities associated with the relative-belief ratios measure the strength of the evidence provide by these ratios so that we can assess whether there is weak or strong evidence in favor or against a particular dimension. Using experimental data from spectral-temporal and polarimetry measurements, we demonstrate how to correctly assign Bayesian plausible error bars for the obtained effective dimensions. This makes relative belief a conservative and easy-to-use model-selection method for any experiment.

TI Utilizing topological invariants for encoding and manipulating chiral
   phonon devices
SO APPLIED PHYSICS LETTERS
AB As a fundamental degree of freedom, phonon chirality is expected to promote the development of quantum information technology just like electron spin. Currently, central to this area is the realization of efficient transmission and control of chiral information. In this paper, we propose an approach by integrating topological theory, leveraging topologically invariant Chern numbers, to encode hexagonal lattice systems. Our investigation reveals the presence of topologically protected chiral interface states within the shared band gaps of both trivial and non-trivial system units. By precisely modulating the magnetic field distribution within the encoding system, we can effectively manipulate the topological pathways. Building upon this framework, we design and implement a chiral phonon three-port device. Through dynamic calculations, we demonstrate the transmission process of chiral information, showcasing the chiral phonon switching effect and logical OR operation. Our findings not only establish a fundamental mechanism for the manipulation and control of phonon chiral information but also provide a promising direction for research in harnessing chirality degrees of freedom in practical applications.

TI Indirect Cooling of Weakly Coupled Trapped-Ion Mechanical Oscillators
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW X
AB Cooling the motion of trapped ions to near the quantum ground state is crucial for many applications in quantum information processing and quantum metrology. However, certain motional modes of trapped -ion crystals can be difficult to cool due to weak or zero interaction between the modes and the cooling radiation, typically laser beams. We overcome this challenge by coupling a mode that interacts weakly with cooling radiation to one that interacts strongly with cooling radiation using parametric modulation of the trapping potential, thereby enabling indirect cooling of the weakly interacting mode. In this way, we demonstrate near -ground -state cooling of motional modes with weak or zero cooling radiation interaction in multi -ion crystals of the same and mixed ion species, specifically 9Be+-9Be+, 9Be+-25Mg+, and 9Be+-25Mg+-9Be+ crystals. This approach can be generally applied to any Coulomb crystal where certain motional modes cannot be directly cooled efficiently, including crystals containing molecular ions, highly charged ions, charged fundamental particles, or charged macroscopic objects.

TI Transport and entanglement growth in long-range random Clifford circuits
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Conservation laws can constrain entanglement dynamics in isolated quantum systems, manifest in a slowdown of higher Renyi entropies. Here, we explore this phenomenon in a class of long-range random Clifford circuits with U (1) symmetry where transport can be tuned from diffusive to superdiffusive. We unveil that the different hydrodynamic regimes reflect themselves in the asymptotic entanglement growth according to S(t) oc t1/z where the dynamical transport exponent z depends on the probability oc r-alpha of gates spanning a distance r. For sufficiently small alpha, we show that the presence of hydrodynamic modes becomes irrelevant such that S(t) behaves similarly in circuits with and without conservation law. We explain our findings in terms of the inhibited operator spreading in U(1)-symmetric Clifford circuits where the emerging light cones can be understood in the context of classical Levy flights. Our Letter sheds light on the connections between Clifford circuits and more generic many-body quantum dynamics.

TI On the foundations and extremal structure of the holographic entropy
   cone
SO DISCRETE APPLIED MATHEMATICS
AB The holographic entropy cone (HEC) is a polyhedral cone first introduced in the study of a class of quantum entropy inequalities. It admits a graph-theoretic description in terms of minimum cuts in weighted graphs, a characterization which naturally generalizes the cut function for complete graphs. Unfortunately, no complete facet or extreme-ray representation of the HEC is known. In this work, starting from a purely graph-theoretic perspective, we develop a theoretical and computational foundation for the HEC. The paper is self-contained, giving new proofs of known results and proving several new results as well. These are also used to develop two systematic approaches for finding the facets and extreme rays of the HEC, which we illustrate by recomputing the HEC on 5 terminals and improving its graph description. We also report on some partial results for 6 terminals. Some interesting open problems are stated throughout.(c) 2022 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Formation of photon molecules in nanoscale waveguides
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB We investigate the formation of photon bound states in a system of interacting photons inside nanoscale wires. The photons interact through the exchange of vibrational modes induced along the waveguide mainly due to radiation pressure. The problem of many-body photons is treated in using the formalism of contour Green's functions under the T-matrix approximation. The complex pole of the T matrix is a signature for the appearance of photon molecules. The analysis of such singularity provides the critical temperature at which the T-matrix approximation breaks down and photon molecules appear. For strongly interacting slow photons the amplitude of the photon-molecule wave function acquires a significant quantum nonlinear phase inside the nanowire. Photon bound states can be implemented for quantum information processing as quantum logic gates, e.g., for pi phase shift the photon molecule is shown to serve as a Z-controlled gate.

TI Optimal detection of ultra-broadband bi-photons with quantum nonlinear
   SU(1,1) interference
SO NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB The visibility of nonlinear SU(1,1) interference directly reflects the nonclassical properties of entangled bi-photons and squeezed light with practically unlimited bandwidth, high efficiency and ultra-high photon flux, orders of magnitude beyond the abilities of standard photo-detectors. We study experimentally the dependence of the SU(1,1) visibility on the phase matching conditions and beam parameters in a free-space configuration, and show that maximal SU(1,1) visibility requires extreme collinear conditions, which deviate from the conditions for maximal nonlinear conversion. We demonstrate near-ideal visibility of similar to 95% (limited only by internal loss) in an ultra-broadband SU(1,1), interferometer with over 120 THz of squeezed light bandwidth. Utilizing this analysis we demonstrate efficient detection of the spectral phase of single-cycle bi-photons and precise compensation of the dispersion over a full octave of bandwidth.

TI Magnetic field induced delocalization in hybrid electron-nuclear spin
   ensembles
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
AB We use field-cycling-assisted dynamic nuclear polarization and continuous radio-frequency (RF) driving over a broad spectral range to demonstrate magnetic-field-dependent activation of nuclear spin transport from strongly hyperfine-coupled C-13 sites in diamond. We interpret our observations with the help of a theoretical framework where nuclear spin interactions are mediated by electron spins. In particular, we build on the results from a four-spin toy model to show how otherwise localized nuclear spins must thermalize as they are brought in contact with a larger ancilla spin network. Further, by probing the system response to a variable driving field amplitude, we witness stark changes in the RF-absorption spectrum, which we interpret as partly due to contributions from heterogeneous multispin sets, whose zero-quantum transitions become RF active thanks to the hybrid electronnuclear nature of the system. These findings could prove relevant in applications to dynamic nuclear polarization, spin-based quantum information processing, and nanoscale sensing.

TI Fast computation of dissipative quantum systems with ensemble rank
   truncation
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB We introduce a new technique for the simulation of dissipative quantum systems. This method is composed of an approximate decomposition of the Lindblad equation into a Kraus map, from which one can define an ensemble of wave functions. Using principal component analysis, this ensemble can be truncated to a manageable size without sacrificing numerical accuracy. We term this method ensemble rank truncation (ERT), and find that in the regime of weak coupling, this method is able to outperform existing wave-function Monte Carlo methods by an order of magnitude in both accuracy and speed. We also explore the possibility of combining ERT with approximate techniques for simulating large systems [such as matrix product states (MPS)], and show that in many cases this approach will be more efficient than directly expressing the density matrix in its MPS form. We expect the ERT technique to be of practical interest when simulating dissipative systems for quantum information, metrology, and thermodynamics.

TI Embedded growth of visible InP quantum dot lasers in silicon nitride
   photonic integrated circuits
SO OPTICA
AB Integrated photonics using visible light is rapidly emerging as a powerful platform for applications including quantum information, biosensing, and displays. We present heteroepitaxial growth of visible red InP quantum dot lasers within pockets etched into SiNx /Si photonic integrated circuits (PICs) for on-chip light sources and amplifiers. While epitaxial 1.3 mu m InAs quantum dot lasers embedded within Si PICs were recently demonstrated, similar integration of red lasers remains unexplored. We achieve a low threshold current density of 450 A/cm2 with emission at 752 nm and uncoupled single-facet output power exceeding 10 mW at room temperature under continuous-wave injection. Although further work is needed to experimentally demonstrate coupling between the embedded lasers and SiNx waveguides, our results represent a critical step toward dense monolithic integration of visible red optical gain on PICs for on-chip applications.

TI Reversing quantum resource hierarchy: non-maximal multipartite
   entanglement in dilaton spacetime
SO EUROPEAN PHYSICAL JOURNAL C
AB It is commonly assumed that a maximally multipartite entangled state carries greater quantum resources than a non-maximally multipartite entangled state in the relativistic framework. In this work, we analyze genuine N-partite entanglement of fermionic modes near the event horizon of the Garfinkle-Horowitz-Strominger (GHS) black hole, quantified by concurrence. Remarkably, our results reveal that in dilaton spacetime the genuine multipartite entanglement of a maximally entangled state is actually smaller than that of a non-maximally entangled state. From the perspective of quantum resources, this implies that a non-maximally entangled state may outperform a maximally entangled one in the GHS black hole background, in clear contrast to previous expectations. Furthermore, given the experimental challenges in preparing a maximally entangled state and the relative feasibility of preparing a non-maximally entangled state, our findings suggest that employing a suitably chosen non-maximally entangled state as the initial resource in curved spacetime provides a more practical and advantageous strategy for quantum information tasks.

TI Magnetic moiré systems: a review
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICS-CONDENSED MATTER
AB This review synthesizes recent advancements in the study of moir & eacute; magnetism. This emerging field, at the intersection of twistronics, topology, and strongly correlated systems, explores novel phenomena that arise when moir & eacute; potentials influence the magnetism of two-dimensional (2D) systems. The manuscript presents recent advances highlighting the interfacial incongruity as a novel mechanism for regulating the magnetism of 2D materials and for the manifestation of various phenomena in twisted and mismatched magnetic 2D interfaces. The manuscript addresses seminal and recent experimental and theoretical advances associated with both small- and large-period magnetic moir & eacute; lattices, including novel magnetic phases, low-energy and topological magnetic excitations, magnetic and electronic transport, optical properties, phase transitions, and prospective applications of these materials. Moir & eacute; magnetism signifies a promising frontier for manipulating complex quantum states in quantum matter. The ongoing advances in this field are poised to impact condensed matter physics, materials science, and quantum information science.

TI Entangling power for symmetric multiqubit systems: A geometrical
   approach
SO ANNALS OF PHYSICS
AB Unitary gates with high entangling power are relevant for several quantum-enhanced technologies due to their entangling capabilities. For symmetric multiqubit systems, such as spin states or bosonic systems, the particle exchange symmetry restricts these gates and also the set of not-entangled states. In this work, we analyze the entangling power of unitary gates in these systems by reformulating it as an inner product between vectors with components given by SU(2) invariants. For small number of qubits, this approach allows us to study analytically the entangling power including the detection of the unitary gate that maximizes it. We observe that extremal unitary gates exhibit entanglement distributions with high rotational symmetry, same that are linked to a convex combination of Husimi functions of certain states. Furthermore, we explore the connection between entangling power and the Schmidt numbers admissible in some quantum state subspaces. Thus, the geometrical approach presented here suggests new paths for studying entangling power linked to other concepts in quantum information theory.

TI Nonreciprocal Strong Mechanical Squeezing Based on the Kerr Effect in
   Cavity-Magnon Optomechanical System
SO ADVANCED QUANTUM TECHNOLOGIES
AB In this study, a scheme is proposed to generate nonreciprocal strong mechanical squeezing in a cavity-magnon optomechanical system based on the Kerr nonlinearity of the yttrium-iron garnet (YIG) sphere. It is found that the magnon squeezing can be directly produced by the Kerr effect and it can induce strong mechanical squeezing through the squeezing transfer achieved by the cavity-magnon interaction and the optomechanical interaction. The results further show that the mechanical mode coupled to the cavity can achieve squeezing effect in the selected magnetic field direction, but not in the opposite one. Moreover, by properly adjusting the magnon effective detuning and the Kerr effect strength, the degree of squeezing of the mechanical mode can even beyond the 3-dB limit, and the optimal conditions for generating stronger squeezing are obtained. This work has important applications in the nonreciprocal quantum devices, quantum information processing, and quantum precision measurement.

TI 2D Time-Domain Spectroscopy for Determination of Energy and Momentum
   Relaxation Rates of Hydrogen-Like Donor States in Germanium
SO ACS PHOTONICS
AB We present measurements of the coherence times of excited states of hydrogen-like arsenic impurities in germanium (Ge:As) using a table-top two-dimensional time-domain spectroscopy (2D-TDS) system. We show that this laboratory system is capable of resolving the coherence lifetimes of atomic-like excited levels of impurity centers in semiconductors, such as those used in solid-state quantum information technologies, on a subpicosecond time scale. By fitting the coherent nonlinear response of the system with the known intracenter transition frequencies, we are able to monitor coherent population transfer and decay of the transitions from the 2p(0) and 2p(+/-) states for different low excitation pulse fields. Furthermore, by examining the off-diagonal resonances in the 2D frequency-domain map, we are able to identify coherences between excited electronic states that are not visible via conventional single-frequency pump-probe or Hahn-echo measurements.

TI Room Temperature Incorporation of Arsenic Atoms into the Germanium (001)
   Surface
SO ANGEWANDTE CHEMIE-INTERNATIONAL EDITION
AB Germanium has emerged as an exceptionally promising material for spintronics and quantum information applications, with significant fundamental advantages over silicon. However, efforts to create atomic-scale devices using donor atoms as qubits have largely focused on phosphorus in silicon. Positioning phosphorus in silicon with atomic-scale precision requires a thermal incorporation anneal, but the low success rate for this step has been shown to be a fundamental limitation prohibiting the scale-up to large-scale devices. Here, we present a comprehensive study of arsine (AsH3) on the germanium (001) surface. We show that, unlike any previously studied dopant precursor on silicon or germanium, arsenic atoms fully incorporate into substitutional surface lattice sites at room temperature. Our results pave the way for the next generation of atomic-scale donor devices combining the superior electronic properties of germanium with the enhanced properties of arsine/germanium chemistry that promises scale-up to large numbers of deterministically placed qubits.

TI Amorphous-silicon visible-light detector integrated on silicon nitride
   waveguides
SO OPTICS LETTERS
AB Visible-light integrated photonics is emerging as a promising technology for the realization of optical devices for applications in sensing, quantum information and communications, imaging, and displays. Among the existing photonic platforms, high-index-contrast silicon nitride (Si3N4) waveguides offer broadband transparency in the visible spectral range and a high scale of integration. As the complexity of photonic integrated circuits (PICs) increases, on-chip detectors are required to monitor their working point for reconfiguration and stabilization operations. In this Letter, we present a semi-transparent in-line power monitor integrated on Si3N4 waveguides that operates in the red-light wavelength range (660 nm). The proposed device exploits the photoconductivity of a hydrogenated amorphous-silicon (a-Si:H) film that is evanescently coupled to an optical waveguide. Experimental results show a responsivity of 30 mA/W, a sensitivity of -45 dBm, and a sub-mu s time response. These features enable the use of the proposed photoconductor for high-sensitivity monitoring and control of visible-light Si3N4 PICs. (C) 2022 Optica Publishing Group

TI Spin Quantum Heat Engine Quantified by Quantum Steering
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB Following the rising interest in quantum information science, the extension of a heat engine to the quantum regime by exploring microscopic quantum systems has seen a boon of interest in the last decade. Although quantum coherence in the quantum system of the working medium has been investigated to play a nontrivial role, a complete understanding of the intrinsic quantum advantage of quantum heat engines remains elusive. We experimentally demonstrate that the quantum correlation between the working medium and the thermal bath is critical for the quantum advantage of a quantum Szilard engine, where quantum coherence in the working medium is naturally excluded. By quantifying the nonclassical correlation through quantum steering, we reveal that the heat engine is quantum when the demon can truly steer the working medium. The average work obtained by taking different ways of work extraction on the working medium can be used to verify the real quantum Szilard engine.

AB We address dynamics of Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs) loaded into a one-dimensional four-color optical lattice (FOL) potential with commensurate wavelengths and tunable intensities. This configuration lends system-specific symmetry properties. The analysis identifies specific multi-parameter forms of the FOL potential which admits exact solitary-wave solutions. This newly found class of potentials includes more particular species, such as frustrated double-well superlattices, and bichromatic and three-color lattices, which are subject to respective symmetry constraints. Our exact solutions provide options for controllable positioning of density maxima of the localized patterns, and tunable Anderson-like localization in the frustrated potential. A numerical analysis is performed to establish dynamical stability and structural stability of the obtained solutions, which makes them relevant for experimental realization. The newly found solutions offer applications to the design of schemes for quantum simulations and processing quantum information.

TI Extending the Large Molecule Limit: The Role of Fermi Resonance in
   Developing a Quantum Functional Group
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY LETTERS
AB Polyatomic molecules equipped with optical cycling centers (OCCs), enabling continuous photon scattering during optical excitation, are exciting candidates for advancing quantum information science. However, as these molecules grow in size and complexity, the interplay of complex vibronic couplings on optical cycling becomes a critical but relatively unexplored consideration. Here, we present an extensive exploration of Fermi resonances in large-scale OCC-containing molecules using high-resolution dispersed laser-induced fluorescence and excitation spectroscopy. These resonances manifest as vibrational coupling leading to intensity borrowing by combination bands near optically active harmonic bands, which require additional repumping lasers for effective optical cycling. To mitigate these effects, we explore altering the vibrational energy level spacing through substitutions on the phenyl ring or changes in the OCC itself. While the complete elimination of vibrational coupling in complex molecules remains challenging, our findings highlight significant mitigation possibilities, opening new avenues for optimizing optical cycling in large polyatomic molecules.

TI Mechanism of Electron Spin Decoherence in a Partially Deuterated Glassy
   Matrix
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY LETTERS
AB Long electron spin coherence lifetimes are essential for applications in quantum information science and electron paramagnetic resonance, for instance, for nanoscale distance measurements in biomolecular systems using double electron-electron resonance. We experimentally investigate the decoherence dynamics under the Hahn echo sequence of the organic radical d(18)-TEMPO in a variably deuterated frozen water:glycerol matrix. The coherence time (phase memory time) T-M scales with proton concentration as [H-1](-0.65). For selectively deuterated matrices, decoherence is accelerated in the presence of proton clustering, that is, substantial short-range density in the proton-proton radial distribution functions (<3 angstrom). Simulations using molecular dynamics and many-body spin quantum dynamics show excellent agreement with experiment and show that geminal proton pairs such as CH2 and OH2 groups are major decoherence drivers. This provides a predictive tool for designing molecular systems with long electron spin coherence times.

TI High-speed programmable photonic circuits in a cryogenically compatible,
   visible-near-infrared 200 mm CMOS architecture
SO NATURE PHOTONICS
AB Recent advances in photonic integrated circuits have enabled a new generation of programmable Mach-Zehnder meshes (MZMs) realized by using cascaded Mach-Zehnder interferometers capable of universal linear-optical transformations on N input/output optical modes. MZMs serve critical functions in photonic quantum information processing, quantum-enhanced sensor networks, machine learning and other applications. However, MZM implementations reported to date rely on thermo-optic phase shifters, which limit applications due to slow response times and high power consumption. Here we introduce a large-scale MZM platform made in a 200 mm complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor foundry, which uses aluminium nitride piezo-optomechanical actuators coupled to silicon nitride waveguides, enabling low-loss propagation with phase modulation at greater than 100 MHz in the visible-near-infrared wavelengths. Moreover, the vanishingly low hold-power consumption of the piezo-actuators enables these photonic integrated circuits to operate at cryogenic temperatures, paving the way for a fully integrated device architecture for a range of quantum applications.

TI Kapitza-Dirac Blockade: A Universal Tool for the Deterministic
   Preparation of Non-Gaussian Oscillator States
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB Harmonic oscillators count among the most fundamental quantum systems with important applications in molecular physics, nanoparticle trapping, and quantum information processing. Their equidistant energy level spacing is often a desired feature, but at the same time a challenge if the goal is to deterministically populate specific eigenstates. Here, we show how interference in the transition amplitudes in a bichromatic laser field can suppress the sequential climbing of harmonic oscillator states (Kapitza-Dirac blockade) and achieve selective excitation of energy eigenstates, Schrodinger cat states, and other non-Gaussian states. This technique can transform the harmonic oscillator into a coherent two-level system or be used to build a large-momentum-transfer beam splitter for matter waves. To illustrate the universality of the concept, we discuss feasible experiments that cover many orders of magnitude in mass, from single electrons over large molecules to dielectric nanoparticles.

TI Strong plasmon-exciton coupling in transition metal dichalcogenides and
   plasmonic nanostructures
SO NANOSCALE
AB Achieving strong coupling between emitters and cavity photons holds an important position in the light-matter interaction due to its applications such as polariton lasing, all-optical switches, and quantum information processing. However, room-temperature polaritonic devices with subwavelength dimensions based on strong light-matter coupling are difficult to realize using traditional emitter-cavity coupled systems. In recent years, coupled systems constructed from plasmonic nanostructures and transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) have shown their potential in achieving room-temperature strong coupling and robustness in the nanofabrication processes. This minireview presents the recent progress in strong plasmon-exciton coupling in such plasmonic-TMD hybrid structures. Differing from a broader scope of strong coupling, we focus on the plasmon-exciton coupling between excitons in TMDs and plasmons in single nanoparticles, nanoparticle-over-mirrors, and plasmonic arrays. In addition, we discuss the future perspectives on the strong plasmon-exciton coupling at few-excitons level and the nonlinear response of these hybrid structures in the strong coupling regime.

TI Photon-mediated dipole-dipole interactions as a resource for quantum
   science and technology in cold atoms
SO QUANTUM SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB Photon-mediated dipole-dipole interactions arise from atom-light interactions, which are universal and prevalent in a wide range of open quantum systems. This pairwise and long-range spin-exchange interaction results from multiple light scattering among the atoms. A recent surge of interests and progresses in both experiments and theories promises this core mechanism of collective interactions as a resource to study quantum science and to envision next-generation applications in quantum technology. Here we summarize recent developments in both theories and experiments, where we introduce several central theoretical approaches and focus on cooperative light scattering from small sample of free-space atoms, an atom-waveguide coupled interface that hosts the waveguide QED, and topological quantum optical platforms. The aim of this review is to manifest the essential and distinct features of collective dynamics induced by resonant dipole-dipole interactions and to reveal unprecedented opportunities in enhancing the performance or offering new applications in light manipulations, quantum metrology, quantum computations, and light harvesting innovations.

TI Two-Party Quantum Private Comparison Protocol for Direct Secret
   Comparison
SO MATHEMATICS
AB In this paper, we leverage the properties of the swap test to evaluate the similarity of two qubits and propose a two-party quantum private comparison (QPC) protocol involving a semi-trusted third party (TP). The TP facilitates the comparison between participants without accessing their private information, other than the final comparison results. Our protocol encodes participants' secret integers directly into the amplitudes of single-photon states and introduces a novel method for secret-to-secret comparison rather than the traditional bit-to-bit comparison, resulting in improved scalability. To ensure security, the encoded single-photon states are concealed using rotation operations. The comparison results are derived through the implementation of the swap test. A simulation on the IBM Quantum Platform demonstrates the protocol's feasibility, and a security analysis confirms its robustness against potential eavesdropping and participant attacks. Compared with existing QPC protocols that employ bit-to-bit comparison methods, our approach offers improved practicality and scalability. Specifically, it integrates single-photon states, rotation operations, and the swap test as key components for direct secret comparison, facilitating easier implementation with quantum technology.

TI Technology roadmap for cold-atoms based quantum inertial sensor in space
SO AVS QUANTUM SCIENCE
AB Recent developments in quantum technology have resulted in a new generation of sensors for measuring inertial quantities, such as acceleration and rotation. These sensors can exhibit unprecedented sensitivity and accuracy when operated in space, where the free-fall interrogation time can be extended at will and where the environment noise is minimal. European laboratories have played a leading role in this field by developing concepts and tools to operate these quantum sensors in relevant environment, such as parabolic flights, free-fall towers, or sounding rockets. With the recent achievement of Bose-Einstein condensation on the International Space Station, the challenge is now to reach a technology readiness level sufficiently high at both component and system levels to provide "off the shelf" payload for future generations of space missions in geodesy or fundamental physics. In this roadmap, we provide an extensive review on the status of all common parts, needs, and subsystems for the application of atom-based interferometers in space, in order to push for the development of generic technology components.

TI Contacting individual graphene nanoribbons using carbon nanotube
   electrodes
SO NATURE ELECTRONICS
AB Individual graphene nanoribbons synthesized by an on-surface approach can be contacted with carbon nanotubes-with diameters as small as 1 nm-and used to make multigate devices that exhibit quantum transport effects such as Coulomb blockade and single-electron tunnelling.
   Graphene nanoribbons synthesized using bottom-up approaches can be structured with atomic precision, allowing their physical properties to be precisely controlled. For applications in quantum technology, the manipulation of single charges, spins or photons is required. However, achieving this at the level of single graphene nanoribbons is experimentally challenging due to the difficulty of contacting individual nanoribbons, particularly on-surface synthesized ones. Here we report the contacting and electrical characterization of on-surface synthesized graphene nanoribbons in a multigate device architecture using single-walled carbon nanotubes as the electrodes. The approach relies on the self-aligned nature of both nanotubes, which have diameters as small as 1 nm, and the nanoribbon growth on their respective growth substrates. The resulting nanoribbon-nanotube devices exhibit quantum transport phenomena-including Coulomb blockade, excited states of vibrational origin and Franck-Condon blockade-that indicate the contacting of individual graphene nanoribbons.

TI Prolonged Orbital Relaxation by Locally Modified Phonon Density of
   States for the SiV- Center in Nanodiamonds
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB Coherent quantum systems are a key resource for emerging quantum technology. Solid-state spin systems are of particular importance for compact and scalable devices. However, interaction with the solidstate host degrades the coherence properties. The negatively charged silicon vacancy center in diamond is such an example. While spectral properties are outstanding, with optical coherence protected by the defects symmetry, the spin coherence is susceptible to rapid orbital relaxation limiting the spin dephasing time. A prolongation of the orbital relaxation time is therefore of utmost urgency and has been tackled by operating at very low temperatures or by introducing large strain. However, both methods have significant drawbacks: the former requires use of dilution refrigerators and the latter affects intrinsic symmetries. Here, a novel method is presented to prolong the orbital relaxation with a locally modified phonon density of states in the relevant frequency range, by restricting the diamond host to below 100 nm. Subsequently measured coherent population trapping shows an extended spin dephasing time compared to the phononlimited time in a pure bulk diamond. The method works at liquid helium temperatures of few Kelvin and in the low-strain regime.

TI Suppressing non-radiative relaxation in a NIR single photon emitter: the
   impact of deuteration and temperature
SO CHEMICAL SCIENCE
AB The fluorescence quantum yield of organic NIR-emitters is typically limited by internal conversion (IC), restricting their applications in imaging and quantum technology. Here, we study the impact of deuteration and temperature on the emission properties of dibenzoterrylene (DBT) by bulk and single molecule spectroscopy. Based on simple photophysical modelling, we first clarify how IC affects the single molecule emission rate. Next, we show that deuteration of DBT leads to a concomitant increase in the fluorescence lifetime and quantum yield by up to 60%. This clear deuterium isotope effect indicates a significant contribution of C-H-vibrations in the IC process. The solvent-dependent changes in the IC rate of hydrogenated and deuterated compounds were found to follow the predictions of the energy gap law in the weak coupling limit. This view is supported by the very weak temperature dependence of the IC rate between 5 and 300 K. Our results not only shed light on the non-radiative relaxation of a topical polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon, but also pave the way for single molecule quantum emitters with high emission yields in the NIR.

   nanophotonic control of fluorescence energy transfer
SO JOURNAL OF MATERIALS CHEMISTRY C
AB Understanding the unresolved connection between a structured environment and F & ouml;rster resonance energy transfer (FRET) is critical in the realm of quantum light-matter interactions, especially for quantum technology applications. This crucial topic was explored by copolymerizing three emitters capable of energy transfer within two nanoparticle series (n1 and n2) that self-assembled into a crystalline colloidal array. Upon excitation, sequential energy transfer between the copolymerized derivatives of anthracene, naphthalimide, and rhodamine B within n1 and n2 resulted in emission spanning the visible spectrum. Nanophotonic control over the photoluminescence of n1 and n2 assembled in an ordered structure was demonstrated by red-shifting the partial photonic bandgap of the ordered structure through the emission spectra of the copolymerized emitters, which was achieved by dilution with deionized water. Nanophotonic manipulation of the energy transfer between the two FRET pairs copolymerized within n1 and n2 was observed, revealing insights in the context of light-matter interactions. Specifically, nanophotonic control over photoluminescence, energy transfer efficiency, and decay kinetics was demonstrated by strategic placement of the partial photonic bandgap.

   strategies in quantum education
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW PHYSICS EDUCATION RESEARCH
AB The present review intends to show the current state of teaching quantum-related content, to analyze and compare its learning efficiency, and to give a systemized overview of quantum-educational activities in the last years. We focus on teaching and learning elements, their innovative tools, and process-oriented studies that are empirically validated. In terms of content, we mainly concentrate on aspects of modern quantum technology. The final dataset for our analysis and synthesis included 50 studies published since 2017 and until the follow-up survey in February 2024. We have found that most of the teaching strategies described and investigated are in the field of quantum mechanics and are designed to provide an introduction to the rather broad and differentiated topic of quantum science. Studies specifically addressing mathematical concepts can exclusively be found for the target group of university students. Visualizing ideas or innovative social interventions to improve quantum learning is mainly found in schools while only a few approaches for further education show validated results. Tools most often examined in the studies reported were of digital nature, though some experiment-focused learning environments were also evaluated.

TI Singlet fission as a polarized spin generator for dynamic nuclear
   polarization
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Singlet fission (SF) can create spin-polarized quintet states in organic systems, but this effect and its potential applications have not been sufficiently explored. Here, authors demonstrate that SF in supramolecular assemblies of pentacene chromophores improves the sensitivity of magnetic resonance of water molecules through dynamic nuclear polarization in a water-glycerol glass.
   Singlet fission (SF), converting a singlet excited state into a spin-correlated triplet-pair state, is an effective way to generate a spin quintet state in organic materials. Although its application to photovoltaics as an exciton multiplier has been extensively studied, the use of its unique spin degree of freedom has been largely unexplored. Here, we demonstrate that the spin polarization of the quintet multiexcitons generated by SF improves the sensitivity of magnetic resonance of water molecules through dynamic nuclear polarization (DNP). We form supramolecular assemblies of a few pentacene chromophores and use SF-born quintet spins to achieve DNP of water-glycerol, the most basic biological matrix, as evidenced by the dependence of nuclear polarization enhancement on magnetic field and microwave power. Our demonstration opens a use of SF as a polarized spin generator in bio-quantum technology.

TI A Review of the High-Power All-Solid-State Single-Frequency
   Continuous-Wave Laser
SO MICROMACHINES
AB High-power all-solid-state single-frequency continuous-wave (CW) lasers have been applied in basic research such as atomic physics, precision measurement, radar and laser guidance, as well as defense and military fields owing to their intrinsic advantages of high beam quality, low noise, narrow linewidth, and high coherence. With the rapid developments of sciences and technologies, the traditional single-frequency lasers cannot meet the development needs of emerging science and technology such as quantum technology, quantum measurement and quantum optics. After long-term efforts and technical research, a novel theory and technology was proposed and developed for improving the whole performance of high-power all-solid-state single-frequency CW lasers, which was implemented by actively introducing a nonlinear optical loss and controlling the stimulated emission rate (SER) in the laser resonator. As a result, the output power, power and frequency stabilities, tuning range and intensity noise of the single-frequency lasers were effectively enhanced.

TI Enhancing self-discharging process with disordered quantum batteries
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW E
AB One of the most important devices emerging from quantum technology are quantum batteries. However, self-discharging, the process of charge wasting of quantum batteries due to decoherence phenomenon, limits their performance, measured by the concept of ergotropy and half-life time of the quantum battery. The effects of local field fluctuation, introduced by the disorder term in the Hamiltonian of the system, on the performance of the quantum batteries is investigated in this paper. The results reveal that the disorder term could compensate disruptive effects of the decoherence, i.e., self-discharging, and hence improve the performance of the quantum battery via ???incoherent gain of ergotropy??? procedure. Adjusting the strength of the disorder parameter to a proper value and choosing a suitable initial state of the quantum battery, the amount of free ergotropy, defined with respect to the free Hamiltonian, could exceed the amount of initial stored ergotropy. In addition harnessing the degree of the disorder parameter could help to enhance the half-life time of the quantum battery. This study opens perspective to further investigation of the performance of quantum batteries that explore disorder and many-body effects.

TI Visualizing atomic structure and magnetism of 2D magnetic insulators via
   tunneling through graphene
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB The discovery of two-dimensional (2D) magnetism combined with van der Waals (vdW) heterostructure engineering offers unprecedented opportunities for creating artificial magnetic structures with non-trivial magnetic textures. Further progress hinges on deep understanding of electronic and magnetic properties of 2D magnets at the atomic scale. Although local electronic properties can be probed by scanning tunneling microscopy/spectroscopy (STM/STS), its application to investigate 2D magnetic insulators remains elusive due to absence of a conducting path and their extreme air sensitivity. Here we demonstrate that few-layer CrI3 (FL-CrI3) covered by graphene can be characterized electronically and magnetically via STM by exploiting the transparency of graphene to tunneling electrons. STS reveals electronic structures of FL-CrI3 including flat bands responsible for its magnetic state. AFM-to-FM transition of FL-CrI3 can be visualized through the magnetic field dependent moire contrast in the dI/dV maps due to a change of the electronic hybridization between graphene and spin-polarised CrI3 bands with different interlayer magnetic coupling. Our findings provide a general route to probe atomic-scale electronic and magnetic properties of 2D magnetic insulators for future spintronics and quantum technology applications.

TI Intertwined Topological Phases in TaAs2 Nanowires with Giant
   Magnetoresistance and Quantum Coherent Surface Transport
SO ADVANCED MATERIALS
AB Nanowires (NWs) of topological materials are emerging as an exciting platform to probe and engineer new quantum phenomena that are hard to access in bulk phase. Their quasi-1D geometry and large surface-to-bulk ratio unlock new expressions of topology and highlight surface states. TaAs2, a compensated semimetal, is a topologically rich material harboring nodal-line, weak topological insulator (WTI), C2-protected topological crystalline insulator, and Zeeman field-induced Weyl semimetal phases. We report the synthesis of TaAs(2 )NWs in situ encapsulated in a dielectric SiO2 shell, which enable to probe rich magnetotransport phenomena, including metal-to-insulator transition and strong signatures of topologically nontrivial transport at remarkably high temperatures, direction-dependent giant positive, and negative magnetoresistance, and a double pattern of Aharonov-Bohm oscillations, demonstrating coherent surface transport consistent with the two Dirac cones of a WTI surface. The SiO2-encapsulated TaAs2 NWs show room-temperature conductivity up to 15 times higher than bulk TaAs2. The coexistence and susceptibility of topological phases to external stimuli have potential applications in spintronics and nanoscale quantum technology.

TI CVD diamond: a review on options and reality
SO FUNCTIONAL DIAMOND
AB In the future, electronic parts will penetrate everything, generating a new and fast-growing pollution problem. Future devices therefore need to be environmentally friendly with strong recycling options. A paradigm change in semiconductor technology is predicted based on applications of better suited materials which can fulfil these criteria. Carbon based materials and here especially diamond are promising candidates. Bulk and surface properties of diamond are introduced in combination with applications in power electronics, quantum technology, bio-and electrochemistry and MEMS. Large amounts of diamond seeds and wafers will be required to approach commercial markets. Their availability in combination with quality and size as well as required energies for production are introduced. The production of CVD diamond is currently about 100-250 times more intense with respect to energy than Silicon. A problem which is addressed by use of new solid-sates microwave sources. The definition of "green diamond" is given taking into account requirements with respect to energy and methane/hydrogen production. A brief discussion and comparison of diamond global markets and related potentials in comparison to SiC and GaN is given.

TI Scalable fabrication of hemispherical solid immersion lenses in silicon
   carbide through grayscale hard-mask lithography
SO APPLIED PHYSICS LETTERS
AB Grayscale lithography allows the creation of micrometer-scale features with spatially controlled height in a process that is fully compatible with standard lithography. Here, solid immersion lenses are demonstrated in silicon carbide using a fabrication protocol combining grayscale lithography and hard-mask techniques to allow nearly hemispherical lenses of 5lm radius to be etched into the substrate. Lens performance was benchmarked by studying the enhancement obtained in the optical collection efficiency for single quantum emitters hosted in silicon carbide. Enhancement by a factor of 4.461.0 was measured for emitters not registered to the center of the lens, consistent with devices fabricated through other methods. The grayscale hard-mask technique is highly reproducible, scalable, and compatible with CMOS technology, and device aspect ratios can be tuned after resist patterning by controlling the chemistry of the subsequent dry etch. These results provide a reproducible, low-cost, high-throughput and industrially relevant alternative to focused ion beam milling for the creation of high-aspectratio, rounded microstructures for quantum technology, and microphotonic applications.

TI Josephson Critical Currents and Related Effects in Ultracold Atomic
   Superfluid Sytems
SO CONDENSED MATTER
AB The Josephson and Proximity effects play a pivotal role in the design of superconducting devices for the implementation of quantum technology, ranging from the standard Al based to the more exotic twisted high-Tc junctions. Josephson critical currents have been recently investigated also in ultracold atomic systems where a potential barrier acts as a weak link. The unifying feature of the above systems, apart from being superconducting/superfluid, is the presence of spatial inhomogeneity, a feature that has to be properly taken into account in any theoretical approach employed to investigate them. In this work, we review the novel (dubbed LPDA for Local Phase Density Approximation) approach based on a coarse graining of the Bogoliubov-de Gennes (BdG) equations. Non-local and local forms of this coarse graining were utilized when investigating Proximity and Josephson effects. Moreover, the LPDA approach was further developed to include pairing fluctuations at the level of the non-self-consistent t-matrix approximation. The resulting approach, dubbed mLPDA (modified LPDA), can be used whenever inhomegeneity and fluctuations effects simultaneously play an important role.

TI Efficient frequency conversion based on resonant four-wave mixing
SO OPTICS LETTERS
AB Efficient frequency conversion of photons has important applications in optical quantum technology because the frequency range suitable for photon manipulation and communication usually varies widely. Recently, an efficient frequency conversion system using a double-A four-wave mixing (FWM) process based on electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT) has attracted considerable attention because of its potential to achieve a nearly 100% conversion efficiency (CE). To obtain such a high CE, the spontaneous emission loss in this resonant-type FWM system must be suppressed considerably. A simple solution is to arrange the applied laser fields in a backward configuration. However, the phase mismatch due to this configuration can cause a significant decrease in CE. Here, we demonstrate that the phase mismatch can be effectively compensated by introducing the phase shift obtained by two-photon detuning. Under optimal conditions, we observe a wavelength conversion from 780 to 795 nm with a maximum CE of 91.2% +/- 0.6% by using this backward FWM system at an optical depth of 130 in cold Rb-87 atoms. The current work represents an important step toward achieving lowloss, high-fidelity quantum frequency conversion based on EIT. (C) 2021 Optical Society of America

TI Ultrahigh-Reflectivity Circularly Polarized Mirrors Based on the
   High-Contrast Subwavelength Chiral Metasurface
SO PHOTONICS
AB The circularly polarized laser sources are core components for many optical applications such as biomedicine, quantum technology, and AR/VR. However, conventional techniques make it difficult to further diminish the size of circularly polarized lasers. Thus, the high-contrast subwavelength chiral metasurface (HCCM) with a 980 nm operating wavelength is numerically investigated. The HCCM is composed of chiral metasurfaces modulating the circular dichroism of reflectance and 6 pairs of Distributed Bragg Reflectors (DBR) with 55% reflectivity. The reason that the HCCM has an ultra-high reflectivity (99.9%) at the operating wavelength of 980 nm is the combination of the optical refractive index difference between the GaAs metasurface and the AlOx substrate and weak destructive interference in the AlOx support layer. In addition, the circular dichroism of the chiral metasurfaces (2.1%) is mainly caused by the displacement of two square air holes in opposite directions, thus transforming the unit cell of the metasurface from C2 symmetry to chiral symmetry. The reflector has the advantages of a simple structure and miniaturization, which is expected to greatly reduce the fabrication difficulty and cost of the circular polarization VCSELs.

TI Spectral stability of V2 centres in sub-micron 4H-SiC membranes
SO NPJ QUANTUM MATERIALS
AB Colour centres in silicon carbide emerge as a promising semiconductor quantum technology platform with excellent spin-optical coherences. However, recent efforts towards maximising the photonic efficiency via integration into nanophotonic structures proved to be challenging due to reduced spectral stabilities. Here, we provide a large-scale systematic investigation on silicon vacancy centres in thin silicon carbide membranes with thicknesses down to 0.25 mu m. Our membrane fabrication process involves a combination of chemical mechanical polishing, reactive ion etching, and subsequent annealing. This leads to highly reproducible membranes with roughness values of 3-4 A, as well as negligible surface fluorescence. We find that silicon vacancy centres show close-to lifetime limited optical linewidths with almost no signs of spectral wandering down to membrane thicknesses of similar to 0.7 mu m. For silicon vacancy centres in thinner membranes down to 0.25 mu m, we observe spectral wandering, however, optical linewidths remain below 200 MHz, which is compatible with spin-selective excitation schemes. Our work clearly shows that silicon vacancy centres can be integrated into sub-micron silicon carbide membranes, which opens the avenue towards obtaining the necessary improvements in photon extraction efficiency based on nanophotonic structuring.

TI Quasi-phase-matching enabled by van der Waals stacking
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Quasi-phase matching (QPM) is a technique extensively utilized in nonlinear optics for enhancing the efficiency and stability of frequency conversion processes. However, the conventional QPM relies on periodically poled ferroelectric crystals, which are limited in availability. The 3R phase of molybdenum disulfide (3R-MoS2), a transition metal dichalcogenide (TMDc) with the broken inversion symmetry, stands out as a promising candidate for QPM, enabling efficient nonlinear process. Here, we experimentally demonstrate the QPM at nanoscale, utilizing van der Waals stacking of 3R-MoS2 layers with specific orientation to realize second harmonic generation (SHG) enhancement beyond the non QPM limit. We have also demonstrated enhanced spontaneous parametric down-conversion (SPDC) via QPM of 3R-MoS2 homo-structure, enabling more efficient generation of entangled photon pairs. The tunable capacity of 3R-MoS2 van der Waals stacking provides a platform for tuning phase-matching condition. This technique opens interesting possibilities for potential applications in nonlinear process and quantum technology.
   Quasi-phase matching (QPM) is a well-known technique to improve the efficiency of frequency conversion processes in 3D nonlinear optical materials. Here, the authors report the implementation of nanoscale QPM in 2D 3R-stacked twisted MoS2, showing enhanced second harmonic generation and spontaneous parametric down-conversion.

TI Phase diffusion and noise temperature of a microwave amplifier based on
   single unshunted Josephson junction
SO COMMUNICATIONS IN NONLINEAR SCIENCE AND NUMERICAL SIMULATION
AB High-gain microwave amplifiers operating near quantum limit are crucial for development of quantum technology. However, a systematic theoretical modeling and simulations of their performance represent rather challenging tasks due to the occurrence of colored noises and nonlinearities in the underlying circuits. Here, we develop a response theory for such an amplifier whose circuit dynamics is based on nonlinear oscillations of an unshunted Josephson junction. The theory accounts for a subtle interplay between exponentially damped fluctuations around the stable limit cycle and the nonlinear dynamics of the limit cycle phase. The amplifier gain and noise spectrum are derived assuming a colored voltage noise at the circuit resistor. The derived expressions are generally applicable to any system whose limit cycle dynamics is perturbed by a colored noise and a harmonic signal. We also critically assess reliabilities of numerical methods of simulations of the corresponding nonlinear Langevin equations, where even reliable discretization schemes might introduce errors significantly affecting simulated characteristics at the peak performance.

TI Observation of Fermi Acceleration with Cold Atoms
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB Cosmic rays are deemed to be generated by a process known as "Fermi acceleration" in which charged particles scatter against magnetic fluctuations in astrophysical plasmas. The process itself is, however, universal, has both classical and quantum formulations, and is at the basis of dynamical systems with interesting mathematical properties, such as the celebrated Fermi-Ulam model. Despite its effectiveness in accelerating particles, Fermi acceleration has so far eluded unambiguous verifications in laboratory settings. Here, we realize a fully controllable Fermi accelerator by colliding ultracold atoms against engineered movable potential barriers. We demonstrate that our Fermi accelerator, which is only 100 mu m in size, can produce ultracold atomic jets with velocities above 0.5 m/s. Adding dissipation, we also experimentally test Bell's general argument for the ensuing energy spectra, which is at the basis of any model of cosmic ray acceleration. On the one hand, our Letter effectively opens the window to the use of cold atoms to study phenomena relevant for high energy astrophysics. On the other, the performance of our Fermi accelerator is competitive with those of best-in-class accelerating methods used in quantum technology and quantum colliders, but with substantially simpler implementation no fundamental physics limit.

TI Impact of nitrogen doping on homoepitaxial diamond (111) growth
SO DIAMOND AND RELATED MATERIALS
AB The impacts of nitrogen (N) doping on the lateral growth mode during two-dimensional (2D) nucleation, on the growth rate, and the incorporation of nitrogen (concentration [N]) of (111)-oriented diamond films were investigated by modulating the [N-2]/[CH4] gas admixture ratio. The 2D nucleation density first increased with increasing [N-2]/[CH4] ratio between 0.02 and 20%. Further increase of the [N-2]/[CH4] ratio to up 200% caused a decrease of the nucleation density. The growth rates showed the similar N-doping dependence as the nucleation density variation. This is attributed to an initial increase of CN radicals in the regime 0.02 to 20%, followed by a reduction of CHx radicals in the regime 20 to 200%. The nitrogen incorporation concentration increases with increasing the [N-2]/[CH4] ratio. The highest nitrogen concentration with 2 x 1020 atoms/cm(3) is detected with [N-2]/[CH4] = 200% and a relatively low nucleation density is achieved. These results are beneficial for the optimized formation of nitrogen-vacancy centers used in a quantum metrology and for device application such as inversion-channel diamond MOSFETs.

TI Maxwell's demon across the quantum-to-classical transition
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB In scenarios coined Maxwell's demon, information on microscopic degrees of freedom is used to seemingly violate the second law of thermodynamics. This has been studied in the classical as well as the quantum domain. In this paper, we study an implementation of Maxwell's demon that can operate in both domains. In particular, we investigate information-to-work conversion over the quantum-to-classical transition. The demon continuously measures the charge state of a double quantum dot and uses this information to guide electrons against a voltage bias by tuning the on-site energies of the dots. Coherent tunneling between the dots allows for the buildup of quantum coherence in the system. Under strong measurements, the coherence is suppressed, and the system is well-described by a classical model. As the measurement strength is further increased, the Zeno effect prohibits interdot tunneling. A Zeno-like effect is also observed for weak measurements, where measurement errors lead to fluctuations in the on-site energies, dephasing the system. We anticipate similar behaviors in other quantum systems under continuous measurement and feedback control, making our results relevant for implementations in quantum technology and quantum control.

TI Recent Advances in Positive Photoresists: Mechanisms and Fabrication
SO MATERIALS
AB Photoresists are fundamental materials in photolithography and are crucial for precise patterning in microelectronic devices, MEMS, and nanostructures. This paper provides an in-depth review of recent advancements in positive photoresist research and development, focusing on discussion regarding the underlying mechanisms governing their behavior, exploring innovative fabrication techniques, and highlighting the advantages of the photoresist classes discussed. The paper begins by discussing the need for the development of new photoresist technologies, highlighting issues associated with adopting extreme ultraviolet photolithography and addressing these challenges through the development of advanced positive-tone resist materials with improved patterning features, resolution, and sensitivity. Subsequently, it discusses the working mechanisms and synthesis methods of different types and subtypes of photoresists, starting from non-chemically amplified, organic, and inorganic-organic hybrid photoresists and progressing to dry film resists, with an emphasis on the upsides of each. The paper concludes by discussing how future research in the field of lithography-prioritizing concerns related to environmental impacts, improved photoresist material and properties, and utilization of advanced quantum technology-can assist with revolutionizing lithography techniques.

TI Doppler compensation for cavity-based atom interferometry
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB We propose and demonstrate a scheme for Doppler compensated optical cavity enhancement of atom interferometers at significantly increased mode diameters. This overcomes the primary limitations in cavity enhancement for atom interferometry, circumventing the cavity linewidth limit and enabling spatial mode filtering, power enhancement, and a large beam diameter simultaneously. This approach combines a magnified linear cavity with an intracavity Pockels cell. The Pockels cell induces a voltage-controlled birefringence allowing the cavity mode frequencies to follow the Raman lasers as they track gravitationally induced Doppler shifts, removing the dominant limitation of current cavity enhanced systems. A cavity is built to this geometry and shown to simultaneously realise Doppler compensation, a 5.8 +/- 0.15 mm 1/e(2) diameter beam waist and an enhancement factor of >5x at a finesse of 35. Mineable Gouy phase enables the suppression of higher order spatial modes and the avoidance of regions of instability. Atom interferometers will see increased contrast at extended interferometry times along with power enhancement and the reduction of optical aberrations. This is relevant to power constrained applications in quantum technology, alongside the absolute performance requirements of fundamental science.

TI High-flux, adjustable, compact cold-atom source
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB Magneto-optical traps (MOTs) are widely used for laser cooling of atoms. We have developed a high-flux compact cold-atom source based on a pyramidMOTwith a unique adjustable aperture that is highly suitable for portable quantum technology devices, including space-based experiments. The adjustability enabled an investigation into the previously unexplored impact of aperture size on the atomic flux, and optimisation of the aperture size allowed us to demonstrate a higher flux than any reported cold-atom sources that use a pyramid, LVIS, 3D-MOT or grating MOT. We achieved 2.1(1) x 10(10) atoms/s of Rb-87 with a mean velocity of 32(1) m/s, FWHM of 27.6(9) m/s and divergence of 59(4) mrad. Halving the total optical power to 195mW caused only a 20% reduction of the flux, and a 30% decrease in mean velocity. Methods to further decrease the velocity as required have been identified. The low power consumption and small size make this design suitable for a wide range of cold-atom technologies.

TI Spectral-focusing coherent anti-Stokes Raman scattering driven by bright
   correlated twin beams
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW APPLIED
AB An understanding of the interaction between bright correlated twin beams and matter is important for expanding the applications of optical quantum technology. In particular, it is worthwhile to clarify the advantages of twin-beam correlation in spectroscopic applications, since twin-beam sources that use parametric down-conversion have a wide range of wavelength tunability. Here, we theoretically and experimentally demonstrate that the spectral-focusing technique used in coherent anti-Stokes Raman scattering (CARS) can be implemented by twin beams without the use of ultrashort-pulse lasers. In typical spectral focusing using ultrashort pulses, spectral resolution is improved by narrowing the instantaneous frequency width due to frequency chirping. Similarly, we show theoretically that the formation of a chirp structure within the temporal correlation of twin beams produces an effect similar to typical spectral focusing. To experimentally demonstrate twin-beam spectral focusing, CARS spectroscopy of polyethylene is performed when the time delay between the chirped twin beams is set within the correlation width or it is set outside the correlation width. We observe that the spectral resolution is improved when the correlation is effective. By comparing with theoretical simulations, we confirm that the improvement is caused by frequency chirping.

TI Vibrational and vibronic structure of isolated point defects: The
   nitrogen-vacancy center in diamond
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
AB We present a theoretical study of vibrational and vibronic properties of a point defect in the dilute limit by means of first-principles density functional theory calculations. As an exemplar we choose the negatively charged nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center, a solid-state system that has served as a testbed for many protocols of quantum technology. We achieve low effective concentrations of defects by constructing dynamical matrices of large supercells containing tens of thousands of atoms. The main goal of the paper is to calculate luminescence and absorption lineshapes due to coupling to vibrational degrees of freedom. The coupling to symmetric alpha(1) modes is computed via the Huang-Rhys theory. Importantly, to include a nontrivial contribution of e modes we develop an effective methodology to solve the multimode E circle times e Jahn-Teller problem. Our results show that for NV centers in diamond a proper treatment of e modes is particularly important for absorption. We obtain good agreement with experiment for both luminescence and absorption. Finally, the remaining shortcomings of the theoretical approach are critically reviewed. The presented theoretical approach will benefit identification and future studies of point defects in solids.

TI Nanomechanical state amplifier based on optical inverted pendulum
SO COMMUNICATIONS PHYSICS
AB A contactless control of mean values and fluctuations of position and velocity of a nanoobject belongs among the key methods needed for ultra-precise nanotechnology and the upcoming quantum technology of macroscopic systems. An analysis of experimental implementations of such a control, including assessments of linearity and the effects of added noise, is required. Here, we present a protocol of linear amplification of mean values and fluctuations along an arbitrary phase space variable and squeezing along the complementary one, referred to as a nanomechanical state amplifier. It utilizes the experimental platform of a single optically levitating nanoparticle and the three-step protocol combines a controlled fast switching of the parabolic trapping potential to an inverted parabolic potential and back to the parabolic potential. The protocol can be sequentially repeated or extended to shape the nanomechanical state appropriately. Experimentally, we achieve amplification of position with a gain of divided by G divided by similar or equal to 2 and a classical squeezing coefficient above 4 dB in as short a timestep as one period of nanoparticle oscillations (7.6 mu s). Amplification in velocity, with the same parameters, squeezes the input noise and enhances force sensing.

TI Comparative study of divacancies in 3C-, 4H-, and 6H-SiC
SO APPLIED PHYSICS LETTERS
AB The divacancy comprising two neighboring vacant sites in the SiC lattice is a promising defect for applications in quantum technology. So far, most research has focused on the divacancy in 4H-SiC, whereas the divacancies in 6H- and 3C-SiC have received much less attention. Here, we outline arguments showing that the neutral charge state of the divacancies in the latter two polytypes is intrinsically stable, in contrast to that in 4H-SiC, where the photoluminescence quenches in most materials for certain excitation energies (below approximately 1.3 eV). Divacancies in 6H- and 3C-SiC are anticipated to remain stable for all excitation energies above resonant excitation. We provide ab initio calculation results for the charge transfer levels of divacancies in 6H- and 3C-SiC. We also show that the luminescence from the divacancy in 3C-SiC vanishes with increasing temperature toward room temperature because of the proximity of the excited state to the conduction band.

TI Quantum Science and Technologies in K-12: Supporting Teachers to

SO EDUCATION SCIENCES
AB Quantum science and computing represent a vital intersection between science and technology, gaining increasing importance in modern society. There is a pressing need to incorporate these concepts into the K-12 curriculum, equipping new generations with the tools to navigate and thrive in an evolving technological landscape. This study explores the professional learning of K-12 teachers (n = 49) related to quantum concepts and pedagogy. We used open-ended surveys, field notes, workshop artifacts, and interviews to examine teachers' perceptions of quantum and how they made connections between quantum and their curriculum. Our data reveal that most teachers were excited and interested in teaching quantum but were aware of potential barriers and concerns that might get in the way of teaching quantum. We found that teachers readily identified connections to math and science in their curriculum, but only a few made connections to computing. Enthusiasm for teaching quantum concepts was found in both elementary and secondary educators, suggesting a widespread recognition of its importance in preparing students for a future where quantum technology is a fundamental aspect of their lives and careers.

TI Back to the future of organolanthanide chemistry
SO CHEMICAL SCIENCE
AB At the dawn of the development of structural organometallic chemistry, soon after the discovery of ferrocene, the description of the LnCp(3) complexes, featuring large and mostly trivalent lanthanide ions, was rather original and sparked curiosity. Yet, the interest in these new architectures rapidly dwindled due to the electrostatic nature of the bonding between pi-aromatic ligands and 4f-elements. Almost 70 years later, it is interesting to focus on how the discipline has evolved in various directions with the reports of multiple catalytic reactivities, remarkable potential in small molecule activation, and the development of rich redox chemistry. Aside from chemical reactivity, a better understanding of their singular electronic nature - not precisely as simplistic as anticipated - has been crucial for developing tailored compounds with adapted magnetic anisotropy or high fluorescence properties that have witnessed significant popularity in recent years. Future developments shall greatly benefit from the detailed reactivity, structural and physical chemistry studies, particularly in photochemistry, electro- or photoelectrocatalysis of inert small molecules, and manipulating the spins' coherence in quantum technology.

TI Chimera Time-Crystalline Order in Quantum Spin Networks
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB Symmetries are well known to have had a profound role in our understanding of nature and are a critical design concept for the realization of advanced technologies. In fact, many symmetry-broken states associated with different phases of matter appear in a variety of quantum technology applications. Such symmetries are normally broken in spatial dimension, however, they can also be broken temporally leading to the concept of discrete time symmetries and their associated crystals. Discrete time crystals (DTCs) are a novel state of matter emerging in periodically driven quantum systems. Typically, they have been investigated assuming individual control operations with uniform rotation errors across the entire system. In this work we explore a new paradigm arising from nonuniform rotation errors, where two dramatically different phases of matter coexist in well defined regions of space. We consider a quantum spin network possessing long-range interactions where different driving operations act on different regions of that network. What results from its inherent symmetries is a system where one region is a DTC, while the second is ferromagnetic. We envision our work to open a new avenue of research on chimeralike phases of matter where two different phases coexist in space.

TI Mode structure of a broadband high gain parametric amplifier
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB A high gain parametric amplifier with a single-pass pulsed pump is known to generate broadband twin photon fields that are entangled in amplitude and phase but have complicated spectral correlation. Fortunately, they can be decomposed into independent temporal modes. However, the early treatment of the parametric interaction Hamiltonian at strong pumping does not consider the issue of the time-ordering problem of the interaction Hamiltonian and thus leads to the inaccurate conclusion that the mode structure and the temporal mode functions do not change as the gain increases. Recent studies have revealed the change of the spectrum with the gain of the process. In this paper we use an approach that is usually employed for treating nonlinear interferometers and avoids the time-ordering issue. This allows us to derive an evolution equation in differential-integral form. Numerical solutions for the high gain situation indicate a gain-dependent mode structure that has its mode distributions changed and mode functions broadened as the gain increases. This study will enable us to have a complete picture of the mode structure of parametric processes and produce high quality quantum sources for a variety of applications of quantum technology.

TI Modified divacancies in 4H-SiC
SO JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYSICS
AB Divacancies near or at lattice defects in SiC, the PL5-PL7 photoluminescence centers, are known to have more favorable optical and spin properties for applications in quantum technology compared to the usual divacancies. These centers were previously predicted to be diva-cancies near stacking faults. Using electron paramagnetic resonance, we observe PL5, PL6, and four other divacancy-like centers, labeled PLa-PLd, in electron-irradiated high-purity semi-insulating (HPSI) 4H-SiC. From the observed fine-structure D-tensors, we show that these centers including PL6, which has so far been believed to be an axial center, all have C-1h symmetry. Among these, PLa, PLc, and PLd are basal divacancies and PL5 and PL6 are slightly deviated from axial symmetry, while PLb is different from others with the principal D-zz axis of the D-tensor aligning at similar to 34 degrees off the c-axis. We show that these modified divacancies are only detected in one type of HPSI materials but not in commercial n- and p-type substrates or n-type pure epitaxial layers irradiated by electrons regardless of surface treatments which are known to create stacking faults.

TI Surface properties, chemical reactivity, and ambient stability of
   cadmium diarsenide CdAs2, a topological chiral material hosting
   Kramers-Weyl fermions
SO APPLIED SURFACE SCIENCE
AB Chiral materials showing Kramers-Weyl fermions represent a suitable platform for quantum technology, i.e., for engineering quantum solenoids, spin-torque devices, polarization-sensitive photodetectors based on quantized circular photogalvanic effect, etc. Accordingly, the stability of this class of materials in oxidative environments, such as the ambient atmosphere, should be carefully investigated to succeed in technology transfer. Here, taking as case-study example the well-recognized topological chiral system cadmium diarsenide (CdAs2), we assess its chemical reactivity towards ambient gases (oxygen and water) and air by density functional theory and experiments. The surface of CdAs2 evolves into an oxide skin, but its thickness remains nanometric even after one year in air, as directly imaged by high-resolution transmission electron microscopy. Accordingly, it is evident that future quantum devices based on Kramers-Weyl fermions could be stable in air, as the oxide layer formed on chiral quantum materials only represents a native oxide, which actually protects bulk features, including Kramers-Weyl fermions (correlated to bulk band structure), from degradation in air.

AB Coupling of light into optical fibers is important for many applications, while for commonly used step-index optical fibers it massively drops for oblique incident angles >15 degrees, limiting their operational range to a narrow angle interval. In this work, we address this issue via inclusion of dielectric concentric ring-type nanostructures located in the core region of commercially available step-index fibers. Modification of fiber facet with the optimized ring-like nanostructure leads to polarization- and azimuthally-independent enhancement of in-coupling efficiency across the entire angle interval from 15 to 85 degrees. We develop the analytical model and show the percent-level of light in-coupling efficiency even at angles as large as 70 degrees, addressing a domain that is out-of-reach for fibers with unstructured end faces. The main result of this work is the enhancement of the in-coupling efficiency at large incident angles (>30 degrees) by several orders of magnitude with respect to a bare fiber. The results obtained are promising for any application that demands to remotely collect light under large angles, such as in-vivo spectroscopy, biosensing or quantum technology.

TI Quantum-Assisted Variational Monte Carlo
SO PRECISION CHEMISTRY
AB Solving the ground state of quantum many-body systems remains a fundamental challenge in physics and chemistry. Recent advancements in quantum hardware have opened new avenues for addressing this challenge. Inspired by the quantum-enhanced Markov chain Monte Carlo (QeMCMC) algorithm, which was originally designed for sampling the Boltzmann distribution of classical spin models using quantum computers, we introduce a quantum-assisted variational Monte Carlo (QA-VMC) algorithm for solving the ground state of quantum many-body systems by adapting QeMCMC to sample the distribution of a (neural-network) wave function in VMC. The central question is whether such a quantum-assisted proposal can potentially offer a computational advantage over classical methods. Through numerical investigations for the Fermi-Hubbard model and molecular systems, we demonstrate that the quantum-assisted proposal exhibits larger absolute spectral gaps and reduced autocorrelation times compared to conventional classical proposals, leading to more efficient sampling and faster convergence to the ground state in VMC as well as a more accurate and precise estimation of physical observables. This advantage is especially pronounced for specific parameter ranges, where the ground-state configurations are more concentrated in some configurations separated by large Hamming distances. Our results underscore the potential of quantum-assisted algorithms to enhance classical variational methods for solving the ground state of quantum many-body systems.

AB Recent works have shown that quantum period-finding can be used to break many popular constructions (some block ciphers such as Even-Mansour, multiple MACs and AEs ...) in the superposition query model. So far, all the constructions broken exhibited a strong algebraic structure, which enables to craft a periodic function of a single input block. Recovering the secret period allows to recover a key, distinguish, break the confidentiality or authenticity of these modes.
   In this paper, we introduce the quantum linearization attack, a new way of using Simon's algorithm to target MACs in the superposition query model. Specifically, we use inputs of multiple blocks as an interface to a function hiding a linear structure. Recovering this structure allows to perform forgeries.
   We also present some variants of this attack that use other quantum algorithms, which are much less common in quantum symmetric cryptanalysis: Deutsch's, Bernstein-Vazirani's, and Shor's. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time these algorithms have been used in quantum forgery or key-recovery attacks.
   Our attack breaks many parallelizable MACs such as LightMac, PMAC, and numerous variants with (classical) beyond-birthday-bound security (LightMAC+, PMAC+) or using tweakable block ciphers (ZMAC). More generally, it shows that constructing parallelizable quantum-secure PRFs might be a challenging task.

TI Integer programming using a single atom
SO QUANTUM SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB Integer programming (IP), as the name suggests is an integer-variable-based approach commonly used to formulate real-world optimization problems with constraints. Currently, quantum algorithms reformulate the IP into an unconstrained form through the use of binary variables, which is an indirect and resource-consuming way of solving it. We develop an algorithm that maps and solves an IP problem in its original form to any quantum system possessing a large number of accessible internal degrees of freedom that are controlled with sufficient accuracy. This work leverages the principle of superposition to solve the optimization problem. Using a single Rydberg atom as an example, we associate the integer values to electronic states belonging to different manifolds and implement a selective superposition of different states to solve the full IP problem. The optimal solution is found within a few microseconds for prototypical IP problems with up to eight variables and four constraints. This also includes non-linear IP problems, which are usually harder to solve with classical algorithms when compared to their linear counterparts. Our algorithm for solving IP is benchmarked by a well-known classical algorithm (branch and bound) in terms of the number of steps needed for convergence to the solution. This approach carries the potential to improve the solutions obtained for larger-size problems using hybrid quantum-classical algorithms.

TI Robust resource-efficient quantum variational ansatz through an
   evolutionary algorithm
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Variational quantum algorithms (VQAs) are promising methods to demonstrate quantum advantage on near term devices as the required resources are divided between a quantum simulator and a classical optimizer. As such, designing a VQA which is resource-efficient and robust against noise is a key factor to achieve a potential advantage with the existing noisy quantum simulators. It turns out that a fixed VQA circuit design, such as the widely used hardware-efficient ansatz, is not necessarily robust against imperfections. In this work, we propose a genome-length-adjustable evolutionary algorithm to design a robust VQA circuit that is optimized over variations of both circuit ansatz and gate parameters, without any prior assumptions on circuit structure or depth. Remarkably, our method not only generates a noise-effect-minimized circuit with shallow depth, but also accelerates the classical optimization by substantially reducing the number of parameters. In this regard, the optimized circuit is far more resource-efficient with respect to both quantum and classical resources. As applications, based on two typical error models in VQA, we apply our method to calculate the ground energy of the hydrogen and the water molecules as well as the Heisenberg model. Simulations suggest that, compared with conventional hardware-efficient ansatz, our circuit-structure-tunable method can generate circuits apparently more robust against both coherent and incoherent noise and hence is more likely to be implemented on near-term devices.

TI An NTRU-like Message Recoverable Signature Algorithm
SO MATHEMATICS
AB An important feature of Nyberg-Rueppel type digital signature algorithms is message recovery, this signature algorithm can recover the original information from the signature directly by the verifier in the verification phase after signing the message. However, this algorithm is currently vulnerable to quantum attacks and its security cannot be guaranteed. Number Theory Research Unit (NTRU) is an efficient public-key cryptosystem and is considered to be one of the best quantum-resistant encryption schemes. This paper proposes an NTRU-like message recoverable signature algorithm to meet the key agreement requirements in the post-quantum world. This algorithm, designed for the Internet of Things (IoT), constructs a secure system using the Group-Based Message Recoverable Signature Algorithm (NR-GTRU), by integrating a Group-Based NTRU-Like Public-Key Cryptosystem (GTRU) with an efficient Nyberg-Rueppel type of NTRU digital signature algorithm (NR-NTRU). This signature algorithm, resistant to quantum algorithm attacks, offers higher security at the cost of a slight efficiency reduction compared to traditional NTRU signature algorithms, and features Nyberg-Rueppel message recovery, making it well-suited for IoT applications.

TI Enhancing Multi-Factor Authentication with Templateless 2D/3D Biometrics
   and PUF Integration for Securing Smart Devices
SO CRYPTOGRAPHY
AB Secure authentication in smart device ecosystems remains a critical challenge, particularly due to the irrevocability of compromised biometric templates in server-based systems. This paper presents a post-quantum secure multi-factor authentication protocol that combines templateless 2D and 3D facial biometrics, liveness detection, and Physical Unclonable Functions (PUFs) to achieve robust identity assurance. The protocol exhibits zero-knowledge properties, preventing adversaries from identifying whether authentication failure is due to the biometric, password, PUF, or liveness factor. The proposed protocol utilizes advanced facial landmark detection via dlib or mediapipe, capturing multi-angle facial data and mapping it. By applying a double-masking technique and measuring distances between randomized points, stabilized facial landmarks are selected through multiple images captured during enrollment to ensure template stability. The protocol creates high-entropy cryptographic keys, securely erasing all raw biometric data and sensitive keys immediately after processing. All key cryptographic operations and challenge-response exchanges employ post-quantum algorithms, providing resistance to both classical and quantum adversaries. To further enhance reliability, advanced error-correction methods mitigate noise in biometric and PUF responses, resulting in minimal FAR and FRR that meets industrial standards and resilience against spoofing. Our experimental results demonstrate this protocol's suitability for smart devices and IoT deployments requiring high-assurance, scalable, and quantum-resistant authentication.

TI Dissipative ground state preparation in ab initio electronic structure
   theory
SO NPJ QUANTUM INFORMATION
AB Dissipative engineering is a powerful tool for quantum state preparation, and has drawn significant attention in quantum algorithms and quantum many-body physics in recent years. In this work, we introduce a novel approach using the Lindblad dynamics to efficiently prepare the ground state for general ab initio electronic structure problems on quantum computers, without variational parameters. These problems often involve Hamiltonians that lack geometric locality or sparsity structures, which we address by proposing two generic types of jump operators for the Lindblad dynamics. Type-I jump operators break the particle number symmetry and should be simulated in the Fock space. Type-II jump operators preserves the particle number symmetry and can be simulated more efficiently in the full configuration interaction space. For both types of jump operators, we prove that in a simplified Hartree-Fock framework, the spectral gap of our Lindbladian is lower bounded by a universal constant. For physical observables such as energy and reduced density matrices, the convergence rate of our Lindblad dynamics with Type-I jump operators remains universal, while the convergence rate with Type-II jump operators only depends on coarse grained information such as the number of orbitals and the number of electrons. To validate our approach, we employ a Monte Carlo trajectory-based algorithm for simulating the Lindblad dynamics for full ab initio Hamiltonians, demonstrating its effectiveness on molecular systems amenable to exact wavefunction treatment.

TI Simulating Many-Body Systems with a Projective Quantum Eigensolver
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB We present a new hybrid quantum-classical algorithm for optimizing unitary coupled-cluster (UCC) wave functions deemed the projective quantum eigensolver (PQE), amenable to near-term noisy quantum hardware. Contrary to variational quantum algorithms, PQE optimizes a trial state using residuals (projections of the Schrodinger equation) rather than energy gradients. We show that the residuals may be evaluated by simply measuring two energy expectation values per element. We also introduce a selected variant of PQE (SPQE) that uses an adaptive ansatz built from arbitrary-order particle-hole operators, offering an alternative to gradient-based selection procedures. PQE and SPQE are tested on a set of molecular systems covering both the weak and strong correlation regimes, including hydrogen clusters with four to ten atoms and the BeH2 molecule. When employing a fixed ansatz, we find that PQE can converge disentangled (factorized) UCC wave functions to essentially identical energies as variational optimization while requiring fewer computational resources. A comparison of SPQE and adaptive variational quan tum algorithms shows that for ansatze containing the same number of parameters the two methods yield results of comparable accuracy. Finally, we show that for a target energy accuracy, SPQE provides a parameterization of similar size or more concise than the one obtained via selected configuration interaction and the density matrix renormalization group on one- to three-dimensional strongly correlated H10 systems in terms of number of variational parameters.

TI Transition Metal Dichalcogenides: Making Atomic-Level Magnetism Tunable
   with Light at Room Temperature
SO ADVANCED SCIENCE
AB The capacity to manipulate magnetization in 2D dilute magnetic semiconductors (2D-DMSs) using light, specifically in magnetically doped transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD) monolayers (M-doped TX2, where M = V, Fe, and Cr; T = W, Mo; X = S, Se, and Te), may lead to innovative applications in spintronics, spin-caloritronics, valleytronics, and quantum computation. This Perspective paper explores the mediation of magnetization by light under ambient conditions in 2D-TMD DMSs and heterostructures. By combining magneto-LC resonance (MLCR) experiments with density functional theory (DFT) calculations, we show that the magnetization can be enhanced using light in V-doped TMD monolayers (e.g., V-WS2, V-WSe2). This phenomenon is attributed to excess holes in the conduction and valence bands, and carriers trapped in magnetic doping states, mediating the magnetization of the semiconducting layer. In 2D-TMD heterostructures (VSe2/WS2, VSe2/MoS2), the significance of proximity, charge-transfer, and confinement effects in amplifying light-mediated magnetism is demonstrated. We attributed this to photon absorption at the TMD layer that generates electron-hole pairs mediating the magnetization of the heterostructure. These findings will encourage further research in the field of 2D magnetism and establish a novel design of 2D-TMDs and heterostructures with optically tunable magnetic functionalities, paving the way for next-generation magneto-optic nanodevices.
   Both experimentally and theoretically it is demonstrated that the magnetization of a 2D dilute magnetic semiconductor based on a V-doped transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD) monolayer or a 2D-TMD heterostructure composed of metallic (magnetic) and semiconducting (non-magnetic) TMD layers can be optically tuned. This establishes a novel direction for designing 2D-TMDs and heterostructures with optically tunable magnetic functionalities for next-generation nanodevices.image

TI How COVID-19 Hijacks the Cytoskeleton: Therapeutic Implications
SO LIFE-BASEL
AB The SARS-CoV-2 virus invades and replicates within host cells by "hijacking" biomolecular machinery, gaining control of the microtubule cytoskeleton. After attaching to membrane receptors and entering cells, the SARS-CoV-2 virus co-opts the dynamic intra-cellular cytoskeletal network of microtubules, actin, and the microtubule-organizing center, enabling three factors that lead to clinical pathology: (1) viral load due to intra-cellular trafficking, (2) cell-to-cell spread by filopodia, and (3) immune dysfunction, ranging from hyper-inflammatory cytokine storm to ineffective or absent response. These factors all depend directly on microtubules and the microtubule-organizing center, as do cell functions such as mitosis and immune cell movement. Here we consider how the SARS-CoV-2 virus may "hijack" cytoskeletal functions by docking inside the microtubule-organizing center's centriole "barrels", enabling certain interactions between the virus's positively charged spike ("S") proteins and negatively charged C-termini of the microtubules that the centriole comprises, somewhat like fingers on a keyboard. This points to the potential benefit of therapies aimed not directly at the virus but at the microtubules and microtubule-organizing center of the host cell on which the virus depends. These therapies could range from anti-microtubule drugs to low-intensity ultrasound (megahertz mechanical vibrations) externally applied to the vagus nerve at the neck and/or to the spleen (since both are involved in mediating inflammatory response). Given that ultrasound imaging machines suitable for vagal/splenic ultrasound are available for clinical trials in every hospital, we recommend an alternative therapeutic approach for COVID-19 based on addressing and normalizing the host cell microtubules and microtubule-organizing centers co-opted by the SARS-CoV-2 virus.

TI Virtual Screening of Phytochemicals by Targeting HR1 Domain of
   SARS-CoV-2 S Protein: Molecular Docking, Molecular Dynamics Simulations,
   and DFT Studies
SO BIOMED RESEARCH INTERNATIONAL
AB The recent COVID-19 pandemic has impacted nearly the whole world due to its high morbidity and mortality rate. Thus, scientists around the globe are working to find potent drugs and designing an effective vaccine against COVID-19. Phytochemicals from medicinal plants are known to have a long history for the treatment of various pathogens and infections; thus, keeping this in mind, this study was performed to explore the potential of different phytochemicals as candidate inhibitors of the HR1 domain in SARS-CoV-2 spike protein by using computer-aided drug discovery methods. Initially, the pharmacological assessment was performed to study the drug-likeness properties of the phytochemicals for their safe human administration. Suitable compounds were subjected to molecular docking to screen strongly binding phytochemicals with HR1 while the stability of ligand binding was analyzed using molecular dynamics simulations. Quantum computation-based density functional theory (DFT) analysis was constituted to analyze the reactivity of these compounds with the receptor. Through analysis, 108 phytochemicals passed the pharmacological assessment and upon docking of these 108 phytochemicals, 36 were screened passing a threshold of -8.5 kcal/mol. After analyzing stability and reactivity, 5 phytochemicals, i.e., SilybinC, Isopomiferin, Lycopene, SilydianinB, and Silydianin are identified as novel and potent candidates for the inhibition of HR1 domain in SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. Based on these results, it is concluded that these compounds can play an important role in the design and development of a drug against COVID-19, after an exhaustive in vitro and in vivo examination of these compounds, in future.

TI Quantum-inspired fluid simulation of two-dimensional turbulence with GPU
   acceleration
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Tensor network algorithms can efficiently simulate complex quantum many-body systems by utilizing knowledge of their structure and entanglement. These methodologies have been adapted recently for solving the Navier-Stokes equations, which describe a spectrum of fluid phenomena, from the aerodynamics of vehicles to weather patterns. Within this quantum-inspired paradigm, velocity is encoded as matrix product states (MPS), effectively harnessing the analogy between interscale correlations of fluid dynamics and entanglement in quantum many-body physics. This particular tensor structure is also called quantics tensor train (QTT). By utilizing NVIDIA's cuQuantum library to perform parallel tensor computations on GPUs, our adaptation speeds up simulations by up to 12.1 times. This allows us to study the algorithm in terms of its applicability, scalability, and performance. By simulating two qualitatively different but commonly encountered 2D flow problems at high Reynolds numbers up to 1 x 107 using a fourth-order time stepping scheme, we find that the algorithm has a potential advantage over direct numerical simulations in the turbulent regime as the requirements for grid resolution increase drastically. In addition, we derive the scaling chi = O(poly(1/F)) for the maximum bond dimension chi of MPS representing turbulent flow fields, with an error E, based on the spectral distribution of turbulent kinetic energy. Our findings motivate further exploration of related quantum algorithms and other tensor network methods.

TI General integer factorization algorithm based on Ising machine
SO EPJ QUANTUM TECHNOLOGY
AB Integer factorization, a fundamental problem in computational mathematics, holds critical significance for modern cryptography, particularly in RSA encryption. Traditional approaches such as the number field sieve face exponential complexity limitations, while Shor's quantum algorithm remains impractical due to hardware constraints. This study proposes a universal algorithm for integer factorization based on Ising machines by transforming the problem into a Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) formulation. The algorithm introduces an optimal reduction formula to optimize the parameter ranges of local field coefficients (h) and coupling coefficients (J) in the Ising model. Additionally, a non-uniform column grouping method is employed to resolve the conflict between coefficient ranges and carry auxiliary quantum bits(qubits), minimizing the number of auxiliary qubits with minimal compromise on coefficient ranges. Using this approach, we successfully factorized the 22-bit integer 2,093,809 with only 118 qubits. Extrapolating to existing photonic Ising machines with 100,000 qubits, our method demonstrates the potential to factorize 631-bit integers, highlighting its promise for efficient large-scale integer factorization. All results presented in this paper are obtained from simulations on Fixstars Amplify and D-Wave simulators.

TI Assessment of quinazoline derivatives as efficient corrosion inhibitor
   for carbon steel in acidic environment. A theoretical and practical
   analysis
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ELECTROCHEMICAL SCIENCE
AB Three quinazoline derivatives namely, 2-methylquinazoline (Q(I)), 1-amino-2-methylquinazolin-4(1 H)-one (Q(II)) and (E)-2-styrylquinazolin-4-ol (Q(III)) were evaluated for their capability to inhibit carbon steel (CSt) corrosion in a 0.5 M H2SO4 solution using chemical, electrochemical, and quantum computation methods. Density functional theory (DFT), Fukui function analysis, and Monte Carlo simulations (MCS) were employed to evaluate the corrosion inhibition efficiency of three quinazoline derivatives (Q(I), Q(II), and Q(III)) on the Fe(110) surface. The findings demonstrate that the inhibition efficiency (%eta) from all methods applied rises as quinazoline derivative concentrations rise and falls with increasing temperature. The values of %eta for Q(I), Q(II), and Q(III) using PDP methods was 94.81 %, 95.32 %, and 96.15 % at 1 x 10(-3)M, respectively. The results demonstrate that the %eta from all methods used rises as quinazoline derivative concentrations rise and falls with increasing temperature. PDP results confirm that quinazoline derivatives are a mixed inhibitor. The inhibition abilities of these derivatives were deduced from their potent adsorption on the CSt surface as demonstrated by the Langmuir isotherm. Quinazoline derivatives operated as efficient pitting inhibitors by transforming the pitting potential to the noble trends. All employed methods confirm that the % IE for Q(III) > Q(II) > Q(I). DFT and MCS calculations reveal Q(III) as the most effective inhibitor that agrees with experimental results.

TI Complexity growth and the Krylov-Wigner function
SO JOURNAL OF HIGH ENERGY PHYSICS
AB For any state in a D-dimensional Hilbert space with a choice of basis, one can define a discrete version of the Wigner function - a quasi-probability distribution which represents the state on a discrete phase space. The Wigner function can, in general, take on negative values, and the amount of negativity in the Wigner function has an operational meaning as a resource for quantum computation. In this note, we study the growth of Wigner negativity for a generic initial state under time evolution with chaotic Hamiltonians. We introduce the Krylov-Wigner function, i.e., the Wigner function defined with respect to the Krylov basis (with appropriate phases), and show that this choice of basis minimizes the early time growth of Wigner negativity in the large D limit. We take this as evidence that the Krylov basis (with appropriate phases) is ideally suited for a dual, semi-classical description of chaotic quantum dynamics at large D. We also numerically study the time evolution of the Krylov-Wigner function and its negativity in random matrix theory for an initial pure state. We observe that the negativity broadly shows three phases: it rises gradually for a time of O D \documentclass[12pt]{minimal} \usepackage{amsmath} \usepackage{wasysym} \usepackage{amsfonts} \usepackage{amssymb} \usepackage{amsbsy} \usepackage{mathrsfs} \usepackage{upgreek} \setlength{\oddsidemargin}{-69pt} \begin{document}$$ O\left(\sqrt{D}\right) $$\end{document} , then hits a sharp ramp and finally saturates close to its upper bound of D \documentclass[12pt]{minimal} \usepackage{amsmath} \usepackage{wasysym} \usepackage{amsfonts} \usepackage{amssymb} \usepackage{amsbsy} \usepackage{mathrsfs} \usepackage{upgreek} \setlength{\oddsidemargin}{-69pt} \begin{document}$$ \sqrt{D} $$\end{document} .

AB Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) are effective in providing more relevant items at higher rankings in recommender systems. However, in real-world scenarios, it is important to provide recommended items with diversity and novelty as well as relevance to each user's preference. Additionally, users often desire a wide range of recommendations not just based on their past search behaviors and histories. To enhance each user's satisfaction, it is important to develop a recommender system that provides much more relevant and diverse items. LightGCN can achieve this, which is a GCN-based recommender system that learns latent vectors of users and items using multiple layers of aggregation functions and an adjacency matrix. However, LightGCN often provides recommendations without diversity when the number of layers is insufficient. On the other hand, when the number is excessive, the accuracy declines, which is known as the over-smoothing problem. To overcome this, we propose a novel approach using a continuous-time quantum walk model derived from a quantum algorithm to reconstruct the user-item adjacency matrix of LightGCN, improving the relevance and diversity of recommendations. We release our codes.(1)

TI A quantum genetic-based routing protocol for real-time peer-to-peer

SO CLUSTER COMPUTING-THE JOURNAL OF NETWORKS SOFTWARE TOOLS AND
   APPLICATIONS
AB Conventional energy sources, such as coal and oil, contribute significantly to pollution and climate change, which explains our urgent need for cleaner, more efficient alternatives. The concept of the Energy Internet has emerged as a promising solution to these challenges. At the heart of the conceived network are energy routers that allow optimal energy distribution across the network through advanced routing protocols. In this paper, we propose a novel real-time, semi-decentralized energy routing protocol that combines Quantum Genetic Algorithms with a modified Greedy Search Algorithm to address the Efficient Path Problem and determine the optimal subset of producers for each consumer. The Greedy Search Algorithm is adapted to solve the path optimization problem, while the quantum algorithm is used for producer subset selection. Additionally, we implement a dynamic scheduling algorithm to handle congestion and collisions effectively. Simulations were conducted in Python on networks of varying sizes, and the results were compared with existing approaches. The findings demonstrate that the proposed protocol outperforms similar methods in both speed and the quality of optimal solutions.

TI Geometric Origin of Quantum Waves from Finite Action
SO QUANTUM REPORTS
AB Quantum mechanics postulates wave-particle duality and assigns amplitudes of the form eiS/& hbar;, yet no existing formulation explains why physical observables depend only on the phase of the action. Here we show that if the quantum of action & hbar;geom is finite, the classical action manifold R becomes compact under the identification S equivalent to S+2 pi & hbar;geom, yielding a U(1) action space on which only modular action is observable. Wave interference then follows as a geometric necessity: a finite action quantum forces physical amplitudes to live on a circle, while the classical limit arises when the modular spacing 2 pi & hbar;geom becomes negligible compared with macroscopic actions. We formulate this as a compact-action theorem. Chronon Field Theory (ChFT) provides the physical origin of & hbar;geom: its causal field Phi mu carries a quantized symplectic flux closed integral omega=& hbar;geom, making Planck's constant a geometric topological invariant rather than an imposed parameter. Within this medium, the Real-Now-Front (RNF) supplies a local reconstruction rule that reproduces the structure of the Feynman path integral, the Schr & ouml;dinger evolution, the Born rule, and macroscopic definiteness as consequences of geometric compatibility rather than supplemental postulates. Phenomenologically, identifying the electron as the minimal chronon soliton-carrying the fundamental unit of symplectic flux-links its spin, charge, and stability to topological properties of the chronon field, yielding concrete experimental signatures. Thus the compact-action/RNF framework provides a unified geometric origin for quantum interference, measurement, and matter, together with falsifiable predictions of ChFT.

TI Variational approach to quantum state tomography based on maximal
   entropy formalism
SO PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY CHEMICAL PHYSICS
AB Quantum state tomography is an integral part of quantum computation and offers the starting point for the validation of various quantum devices. One of the central tasks in the field of state tomography is to reconstruct, with high fidelity, the quantum states of a quantum system. From an experiment on a real quantum device, one can obtain the mean measurement values of different operators. With such data as input, in this report we employ the maximal entropy formalism to construct the least biased mixed quantum state that is consistent with the given set of expectation values. Even though, in principle, the reported formalism is quite general and should work for an arbitrary set of observables, in practice we shall demonstrate the efficacy of the algorithm on an informationally complete (IC) set of Hermitian operators. Such a set possesses the advantage of uniquely specifying a single quantum state from which the experimental measurements have been sampled and hence renders the rare opportunity not only to construct a least-biased quantum state but even replicate the exact state prepared experimentally within a preset tolerance. The primary workhorse of the algorithm is reconstructing an energy function which we designate as the effective Hamiltonian of the system, and parameterizing it with Lagrange multipliers, according to the formalism of maximal entropy. These parameters are thereafter optimized variationally so that the reconstructed quantum state of the system converges to the true quantum state within an error threshold. To this end, we employ a parameterized quantum circuit and a hybrid quantum-classical variational algorithm to obtain such a target state, making our recipe easily implementable on a near-term quantum device.

TI One-dimensional quantum walks with a time and spin-dependent phase shift
SO PHYSICS LETTERS A
AB We investigate the role of a time and spin-dependent phase shift on the evolution of one-dimensional discrete-time quantum walks. By employing Floquet engineering a time and spin-dependent phase shift (phi) is stroboscopically imprinted onto the walker's wave function at the end of each step of the walk. For a quantum walk driven by the standard protocol and with rational values of the phase factor, i.e., phi/2 pi = p/q we show with our numerical simulations that revivals with equal periods occur in the probability distribution of the walk. In the split-step quantum walk we employ two different coin operators which are parametrized by a parameter delta theta. By making use of delta theta as a control parameter we demonstrate that for phi/2 pi = p/q the walk exhibits three major types of dynamics: ballistic spreading, revivals, and localization. For an irrational value of phi/2 pi our results show revivals with unpredictable periods, and the walker remains localized in a small region of the lattice. Furthermore, in view of an experimental realization we investigate the robustness of revivals against noise in the phase shift. Our results show that signatures of revivals persist for smaller values of the noise parameter while these vanish for larger values. Our work is important in the context of quantum computation and simulation with quantum walks where different types of the walk dynamics can be engineered by making use of the time and spin-dependent phases shift, and the coin parameter as control knobs.

TI Quantum-enhanced signal processing via VQE for improved biomechanical
   feedback control
SO DIGITAL SIGNAL PROCESSING
AB The Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) is a hybrid quantum-classical algorithm that has demonstrated significant potential for solving quantum chemistry problems, particularly in determining the ground state energy of small molecules like H2. In this paper, we extend the application of VQE beyond quantum chemistry by utilizing it to analyze sensor data from engineered socks equipped with an accelerometer, and gyroscope sensors. Our goal is to explore the sensitivity of accelerometer and gyroscope signals to specific motion frequencies by encoding their data into the quantum states of the H2 molecule's qubits. We introduce an automatic control mechanism based on a classical feedback loop, where the output of the VQE is compared to the desired input, and corrective actions are applied using a constant K to ensure the output follows the input closely. This feedback loop is designed to assist the algorithm in managing local minima, noise, and computational challenges. Using this feedback-controlled VQE system, we optimize sensor signal analysis and determine which sensor exhibits higher sensitivity to specific biomechanical frequencies. Our experimental results indicate the potential flexibility of VQE in analyzing specific biomechanical data, providing preliminary insights into the broader applications of quantum algorithms in wearable technology. As quantum hardware advances, VQE may offer applications in complex systems and diverse fields, including personalized healthcare and motion capture.

TI Spatial search on Johnson graphs by discrete-time quantum walk
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICS A-MATHEMATICAL AND THEORETICAL
AB The spatial search problem aims to find a marked vertex of a finite graph using a dynamic with two constraints: (1) the walker has no compass and (2) the walker can check whether a vertex is marked only after reaching it. This problem is a generalization of unsorted database search and has many applications to algorithms. Classical algorithms that solve the spatial search problem are based on random walks and the computational complexity is determined by the hitting time. On the other hand, quantum algorithms are based on quantum walks and the computational complexity is determined not only by the number of steps to reach a marked vertex, but also by the success probability, since we need to perform a measurement at the end of the algorithm to determine the walker's position. In this work, we address the spatial search problem on Johnson graphs using the coined quantum walk model. Since Johnson graphs are vertex- and distance-transitive, we have found an invariant subspace of the Hilbert space, which aids in the calculation of the computational complexity. We have shown that, for every fixed diameter, the asymptotic success probability is 1/2 after taking pi root N/(2 root 2) steps, where N is the number of vertices of the Johnson graph.

TI Complexity of Quantum State Verification in the Quantum Linear Systems
   Problem
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB We analyze the complexity of quantum state verification in the context of solving systems of linear equations of the form A (x) over right arrow = (b) over right arrow. We show that any quantum operation that verifies whether a given quantum state is within a constant distance from the solution of the quantum linear systems problem requires q = Omega(kappa) uses of a unitary that prepares a quantum state vertical bar b >, proportional to (b) over right arrow, and its inverse in the worst case. Here,kappa is the condition number of matrix A. For typical instances, we show that q = Omega (root kappa) with high probability. These lower bounds are almost achieved if quantum state verification is performed using known quantum algorithms for the quantum linear systems problem. We also analyze the number of copies of vertical bar b > required by verification procedures of the prepare-and-measure type. In this case, the lower bounds are quadratically worse, being Omega (kappa(2)) in the worst case and Omega (kappa.) in typical instances with high probability. We discuss the implications of our results to known variational and related approaches to this problem, where state preparation, gate, and measurement errors will need to decrease rapidly with kappa for worst-case and typical instances if error correction is not used, and present some open problems.

TI Ising Hamiltonians for Constrained Combinatorial Optimization Problems
   and the Metropolis-Hastings Warm-Starting Algorithm
SO ADVANCED QUANTUM TECHNOLOGIES
AB Quantum approximate optimization algorithm (QAOA) is a promising variational quantum algorithm for combinatorial optimization problems. However, the implementation of QAOA is limited due to the requirement that the problems be mapped to Ising Hamiltonians and the nonconvex optimization landscapes. Although the Ising Hamiltonians for many NP hard problems have been obtained, a general method to obtain the Ising Hamiltonians for constrained combinatorial optimization problems (CCOPs) has not yet been investigated. In this paper, a general method is introduced to obtain the Ising Hamiltonians for CCOPs and the Metropolis-Hastings warm-starting algorithm for QAOA is presented which can provably converge to the global optimal solutions. The effectiveness of this method is demonstrated by tackling the minimum weight vertex cover (MWVC) problem, the minimum vertex cover (MVC) problem, and the maximal independent set problem as examples. The Ising Hamiltonian for the MWVC problem is obtained first time by using this method. The advantages of the Metropolis-Hastings warm-starting algorithm presented here is numerically analyzed through solving 30 randomly generated MVC cases with 1-depth QAOA.

TI A Depth-Progressive Initialization Strategy for Quantum Approximate
   Optimization Algorithm
SO MATHEMATICS
AB The quantum approximate optimization algorithm (QAOA) is known for its capability and universality in solving combinatorial optimization problems on near-term quantum devices. The results yielded by QAOA depend strongly on its initial variational parameters. Hence, parameter selection for QAOA becomes an active area of research, as bad initialization might deteriorate the quality of the results, especially at great circuit depths. We first discuss the patterns of optimal parameters in QAOA in two directions: the angle index and the circuit depth. Then, we discuss the symmetries and periodicity of the expectation that is used to determine the bounds of the search space. Based on the patterns in optimal parameters and the bounds restriction, we propose a strategy that predicts the new initial parameters by taking the difference between the previous optimal parameters. Unlike most other strategies, the strategy we propose does not require multiple trials to ensure success. It only requires one prediction when progressing to the next depth. We compare this strategy with our previously proposed strategy and the layerwise strategy for solving the Max-cut problem in terms of the approximation ratio and the optimization cost. We also address the non-optimality in previous parameters, which is seldom discussed in other works despite its importance in explaining the behavior of variational quantum algorithms.

TI Dynamic Transitive Closure-based Static Analysis through the Lens of
   Quantum Search
SO ACM TRANSACTIONS ON SOFTWARE ENGINEERING AND METHODOLOGY
AB Many existing static analysis algorithms suffer from cubic bottlenecks because of the need to compute a dynamic transitive closure (DTC). For the first time, this article studies the quantum speedups on searching subtasks in DTC-based static analysis algorithms using quantum search (e.g., Grover's algorithm). We first introduce our oracle implementation in Grover's algorithm for DTC-based static analysis and illustrate our quantum search subroutine. Then, we take two typical DTC-based analysis algorithms: context-free-language reachability and set constraint-based analysis, and show that our quantum approach can reduce the time complexity of these two algorithms to truly subcubic (O(N-2 root Npolylog(N))), yielding better results than the upper bound (O(N-3/log N)) of existing classical algorithms. Finally, we conducted a classical simulation of Grover's search to validate our theoretical approach, due to the current quantum hardware limitation of lacking a practical, large-scale, noise-free quantum machine. We evaluated the correctness and efficiency of our approach using IBM Qiskit on nine open-source projects and randomly generated edge-labeled graphs/constraints. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach and shed light on the promising direction of applying quantum algorithms to address the general challenges in static analysis.

TI An apologia for islands
SO JOURNAL OF HIGH ENERGY PHYSICS
AB Entanglement islands have played a key role in the recent derivation of the Page curve and other progress on the black hole information problem. Arising from the inclusion of connected wormhole saddles in a gravitational replica trick, islands signal that degrees of freedom in the black hole interior are not microscopically independent of the exterior Hawking radiation. Islands were originally discovered in the context of AdS/CFT coupled to an external, nongravitating reservoir, where the coupling gives graviton excitations an anomalous boundary scaling dimension (or "mass"). It has been claimed in the literature that this mass is crucial for the existence of islands and even the Page curve itself. In this paper, however, we explain how entanglement islands can also appear in setups with massless gravitons and no external reservoir, giving a number of examples including the entanglement wedges of boundary CFT regions, of radiation at null infinity in asymptotically flat spacetimes, and of radiation inside a semiclassical but gravitating spacetime. In each case, the Page curve is physically observable and can be determined with sufficiently careful experiments on many copies of the black hole. We give general arguments for the existence of gauge-invariant operators in gravity which are compactly supported to all orders in perturbation theory (whenever no isometries of the background spacetime exist) and refine a recently-proposed explicit construction of such operators. When applied to islands, these results - together with entanglement wedge reconstruction - guarantee that semiclassical operators in the island can be approximated by nonperturbative operators on the Hawking radiation.

TI Fractionally charged anyons generated by topological path fusion of
   propagating electron in magnetic flux lattice
SO NUCLEAR PHYSICS B
AB Anyon is collective excitation of two dimensional electron gas subjected to strong magnetic field, carrying fractional charges and exotic statistical character beyond fermion and boson. So far, anyons with serial fractional charges only exist in fractional quantum Hall effect. It is still a challenge to find new serial of fractional charges in other physical system and develop an unified mathematical physics theory based on the same root. Here a topological path fusion theory of propagating electrons in magnetic flux lattice is proposed to explore the physical origin of fractional charges based on a generalization of Feynman's path integral theory and Thurston's train track theory. This mathematical physics theory generated the existed serial of fractional charges in fractional quantum Hall effect and predicted new serial of fractional charges. A serial of irrational charges are predicted in one dimensional lattice of magnetic fluxes. Fractionally charged anyons are also generated in two dimensional and three dimensional lattice of train tracks of electric currents, revealing an exact correspondence between knot lattice model and train track model. A new explanation for the modular symmetry of complex Hall conductance and composite fermion in fractional quantum Hall effect is also derived from this topological path fusion theory. Experimental observation of anyon in three dimensions can be realized by constructing three dimensional interlocking magnetic fluxes or mapping magnetic fluxes into forbidden zones in multi-connected space filled by solid state material. A photonic crystal with porous nano-structures is a promising system for detecting fractional charges and paves a new way for topological quantum computation. (C) 2021 The Author(s).

TI An unified topological representation theory of the integral and
   fractional quantum Hall fluid by folding the membrane of quantum
   electron fluid
SO NUCLEAR PHYSICS B
AB How to understand the integral and fractional quantum Hall resistivity in an unified mathematical physics theory remained an unsolved problem in the past four decades. Here the quantum Hall fluid is modeled as electron fluid membrane that winds around magnetic fluxes. The train tracks of fractional quantum Hall fluid lies in the cross section edge surface of the folded membrane, which is spontaneously characterized by the knot lattice of magnetic fluxes in the bulk zone. The transition from the fractional Hall fluid to the integral Hall fluid is characterized by a geometric transformation in hyperbolic space. Both the integral and fractional Hall resistivity are unified into one exact resistivity equation, Rxy = (h/e2)B(m), B(m) = (n+v(m))-1, with respect to the bulk energy gap Delta E = heB(m)/Mc, that agrees with experimental measurements. This electron fluid membrane model provides a natural representation of Wen-Zee matrix formulation of topological fluid for quantum Hall effect under topological surgery and train track. When the electron fluid membrane in real space is mapped into momentum space, the Thouless-Kohmoto-Nightingale-Den Nijs (TKNN) formula of integral Hall conductance is generalized to fractional Hall conductance. The Thurston's train track in two dimensions is generalized to the folding laminar membranes in three dimensions, which predicted fractional quantum Hall fluid in three dimensions, and provided an analytical explanation on the measured competing phenomena between different fractional quantum Hall states. A fractional quantum Hall effect in hyperbolic space is predicted in the plane perpendicular to the conventional 2D electron gas in inhomogeneous magnetic field. This topological representation theory provides a different path to implement string theory and topological quantum computation by folding laminar quantum fluid.

TI Electronic structure theory with molecular point group symmetries on
   quantum annealers
SO JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL PHYSICS
AB Quantum computation has the potential to revolutionize quantum chemistry through major speedups in computation times and an exponential reduction in computational resources. Here, we combine the symmetry-adapted Jordan-Wigner encoding based on the full Boolean symmetry group Z(2)(k) with our new implementation of the Xia-Bian-Kais (XBK) method for improving the efficiency of electronic structure theory calculations on quantum annealers, particularly by reducing the number of qubits needed to achieve the same accuracy. By providing a more extensive symmetry-adapted encoding (SAE) than previous work, we are able to simulate molecules larger than those previously reported that have been studied using methods developed for quantum annealers and without using an active space. We calculated the potential energy surfaces of H-2, LiH, He-2, H2O, O-2, N-2, Li-2, F-2, CO, BH3, NH3, and CH4, with the largest molecule in the STO-6G basis set requiring 16 qubits with our SAE, and compared them with full configuration interaction results. The application of SAE to the XBK method provides an exponential reduction in the size of the Hilbert space and scales well with the size of the problem. It does not introduce significant additional errors for even or large values of a key variational parameter that determines the number of ancilla qubits used in the XBK method's Hamiltonian embedding, or for certain molecules such as He-2 and H2O. We provide an explanation for this behavior and a recommendation on the usage of our method. In addition, we briefly discuss the potential of extracting electronic excited states from our method.

TI Ubiquity of Rotational Symmetry Breaking in Superconducting Films, From
   Fe(Te,Se)/Bi2Te3 to Nb, and the Effect of
   Measurement Geometry
SO ADVANCED SCIENCE
AB FeTe0.5Se0.5/Bi2Te3 heterostructure is a promising new platform in the journey toward topological quantum computation, considering that first, FeTe0.5Se0.5 (FTS) is itself known to be a topological superconductor (TSC) and second, the heterostructure has topological interface states that can be proximitized into TSC even if FTS fails to become TSC on its own. Here, it is shown that this system exhibits quasi-2D superconductivity, and utilizing the standard in-plane magneto-transport measurements, two-fold anisotropy (a.k.a nematicity) is discovered in longitudinal resistance (Rxx) and critical current (Ic) measurements, even though the system exhibits globally 12-fold symmetry. Then, similar measurements are carried out on a polycrystalline niobium (Nb) thin film, a well-known s-wave elemental superconductor, and a similar two-fold symmetry is found even for this Nb system. This implies either that nematic behavior is ubiquitous or that the in-plane magneto-transport measurement scheme routinely used to detect nematicity, is not a reliable method to probe nematicity. It is shown that the angle-dependent response of vortices in the superconducting regime to the magnetic Lorentz force is very likely the main cause behind the ubiquitous nematic behaviors of this measurement scheme. In other words, this measurement scheme is intrinsically two-fold, and is therefore not suitable to detect the nematicity. Accordingly, all the previous reports of nematicity based on similar measurement practices, reported on various samples, including thin films, bulk crystals, and exfoliated flakes, need to be reinterpreted.

TI Calculations of in-gap states of ferromagnetic spin chains on s-wave
   wide-band superconductors
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
AB Magnetic impurities create in-gap states on superconductors. Recent experiments explore the topological properties of one-dimensional arrays of magnetic impurities on superconductors, because in certain regimes p-wave pairing can be locally induced leading to new topological phases. A byproduct of the new accessible phases is the appearance of zero-energy edge states that have non-Abelian exchange properties and can be used for topological quantum computation. Despite the large amount of theory devoted to these systems, most treatments use approximations that render their applicability limited when comparing with usual experiments of 1D impurity arrays on wide-band superconductors. These approximations either involve tight-binding-like approximations where the impurity energy scales match the minute energy scale of the superconducting gap and are many times unrealistic, or they assume strongly-bound in-gap states. Here, we use a theory for s-wave superconductors based on a wide-band normal metal, with any possible energy scale for the magnetic impurities and develop an efficient way of computing the well-known topological invariants of infinite chains. We perform concrete calculations on ferromagnetic spin chains using BCS Green's function for the superconductor and including Rashba coupling to compare with recent experimental results. The infinite-chain properties can be analytically obtained, giving us a way to compare with finite-chain calculations. We show that it is possible to converge to the infinite limit by doing finite-size numerical calculation, paving the way for numerical calculations not based on analytical Green's functions. As an application, we show that energy oscillations around zero with increasing number of atoms in the spin chain does not reflect the topological origin of the low-energy state.

TI Memristive switching in the surface of a charge-density-wave topological
   semimetal
SO SCIENCE BULLETIN
AB Owing to the outstanding properties provided by nontrivial band topology, topological phases of matter are considered as a promising platform towards low-dissipation electronics, efficient spin-charge conversion, and topological quantum computation. Achieving ferroelectricity in topological materials enables the non-volatile control of the quantum states, which could greatly facilitate topological electronic research. However, ferroelectricity is generally incompatible with systems featuring metallicity due to the screening effect of free carriers. In this study, we report the observation of memristive switching based on the ferroelectric surface state of a topological semimetal (TaSe 4 ) 2 I. We find that the surface state of (TaSe 4 ) 2 I presents out-of-plane ferroelectric polarization due to surface reconstruction. With the combination of ferroelectric surface and charge-density-wave-gapped bulk states, an electric-switchable barrier height can be achieved in (TaSe 4 ) 2 I-metal contact. By employing a multi-terminal-grounding design, we manage to construct a prototype ferroelectric memristor based on (TaSe 4 ) 2 I with on/off ratio up to 10 3 , endurance over 10 3 cycles, and good retention characteristics. The origin of the ferroelectric surface state is further investigated by first-principles calculations, which reveal an interplay between ferroelectricity and band topology. The emergence of ferroelectricity in (TaSe 4 ) 2 I not only demonstrates it as a rare but essential case of ferroelectric topological materials, but also opens new routes towards the implementation of topological materials in functional electronic devices.

TI Polarization-Dependent Selection Rules and Optical Spectrum Atlas of
   Twisted Bilayer Graphene Quantum Dots
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW X
AB Understanding how symmetries encode optical polarization information into selection rules in molecules and materials is important for their optoelectronic applications including spectroscopic analysis, display technology, and quantum computation. Here, we extend polarization-dependent selection rules from atoms to solid-state systems with various point groups with the help of the rotational operator for circular polarization and the twofold rotational operator (or reflection operator) for linear polarization. We use these new selection rules to study the optical properties of twisted bilayer graphene quantum dots (TBGQDs), which inherit advantages of graphene quantum dot including its ultrathin thickness, excellent biocompatibility, and shape- and size-tunable optical absorption or emission. We study how the electronic structures and optical properties of TBGQDs rely on size, shape, twist angle, and correlation effects for TBGQDs with 10 different point groups for which we obtain an optical selection rule database. We show how current operator matrix elements identify the generalized polarization-dependent selection rules. Our results show that both the electronic and optical band gaps follow power-law size scalings with a dominant role of the twist angle. We derive an atlas of optical conductivity spectra for both size and twist angle in TBGQDs. As a result of quantum confinement effects, in the atlas a new type of optical conductivity features emerges with multiple discrete absorption frequencies ranging from infrared to ultraviolet energy, allowing for applications in photovoltaic devices and photodetectors. The atlas and size scaling provide a full structure???symmetry-function interrelation and hence offer an excellent basis for the geometrical manipulation of optical properties of TBGQDs as building blocks for novel integrated carbon optoelectronics.

TI Modulating quantum tunnelling of magnetization in Dy isotopologue dimers
SO DALTON TRANSACTIONS
AB Qudits are anticipated to streamline quantum computation by minimizing iterations, lowering error rates, and facilitating error correction. It has been shown that Dy(iii)-based molecular systems can act as qudits with expanded Hilbert spaces. Achieving a robust intramolecular interaction, whether exchange or dipolar, is crucial for spanning the Hilbert space of qudits; hence, short Dy(iii)& ctdot;Dy(iii) distances are required. Looking for multilevel systems that can be employed as qudits, we have synthesized and characterized two dysprosium-based isotopologues: [163Dy2(BTFA)4(PHZP)2]0 (1(I=5/2)) and [164Dy2(BTFA)4(PHZP)2]0 (2(I=0)), where BTFA = 3-benzoyl-1,1,1-trifluoroacetone and PHZP = N '-[(E)-(pyrazin-2-yl)methylidene]pyrazine-2-carbohydrazonate. Both complexes showed slow magnetic relaxation at zero applied magnetic field. mu SQUID investigations, at milli-Kelvin temperatures, and direct and alternating current magnetic measurements reveal distinctions in the magnetic behavior between the two complexes and an operative interaction between the Dy(iii) centers. We find that the presence or absence of the nuclear spin plays a minor role in the magnetic properties above 2 K. On the contrary, at milli-Kelvin temperatures, mu SQUID studies show enhanced relaxation in 1(I=5/2), attributed to several quantum tunnelling pathways enabled by hyperfine and quadrupole interactions. The interplay between the antiferromagnetic coupling and enhanced relaxation indicates that the exchange coupling influences the relaxation mechanisms at different temperature ranges.
   Two dysprosium isotopologues show minimal nuclear spin effect above 2 K. At milli-Kelvin temperatures, relaxation increases in the nuclear spin-bearing system due to quantum tunneling of magnetization driven by hyperfine and quadrupole interactions.

TI Computational characterization of thermal and mechanical properties of
   single and bilayer germanene nanoribbon
SO COMPUTATIONAL MATERIALS SCIENCE
AB Two-dimensional germanene has provided a cornucopia of new functionalities in the field of nanotechnology owing to its remarkable electronic and thermoelectric attributes. The robust spin-orbit coupling and high carrier mobility give rise to many salient features including non-trivial topological properties, quantum spin-Hall state near room temperature, and topological superconductivity, rendering it an excellent contender for valleytronics, spintronics, and quantum computation. As such, an in-depth characterization of thermal and mechanical properties of germanene is crucial for its practical implication and efficient operation, which remains elusive. Here, we employed equilibrium molecular dynamics simulations utilizing Stillinger Weber potential to reveal the mechanical strength, melting temperature, and phonon thermal conductivity (PTC) of single-layer germanene nanoribbon (SLGeNR) and bilayer germanene nanoribbon (BiLGeNR). Effects of temperature, biaxial tensile and compressive strain, monovacancy defects, length and width of the nanoribbon on the PTC have been rigorously investigated. It has been found that PTC of SLGeNR could be substantially reduced by BiLGeNR. Our simulation results suggest that PTC of SLGeNR demonstrates an inverse relation with temperature, biaxial compressive strain, and monovacancy defects while biaxial tensile strain, length and width of the nanoribbon increases the PTC of SLGeNR significantly. To understand the PTC more profoundly, phonon density of state (PDOS) profiles have been studied. The BiLGeNR demonstrates more tensile strength as well as melting temperature compared to SLGeNR. This study offers a comprehensive guideline for engineering the TC as well as discloses important mechanical and melting characteristics of the SLGeNR and BiLGeNR for a wide range of applications in flexible nano-electronics and thermoelectric nanodevices.

TI Hierarchy of Topological Order From Finite-Depth Unitaries, Measurement,
   and Feedforward
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB Long-range entanglement-the backbone of topologically ordered states-cannot be created in finite time using local unitary circuits, or, equivalently, adiabatic state preparation. Recently, it has come to light that single-site measurements provide a loophole, allowing for finite-time state preparation in certain cases. Here we show how this observation imposes a complexity hierarchy on long-range entangled states based on the minimal number of measurement layers required to create the state, which we call "shots." First, similar to Abelian stabilizer states, we construct single-shot protocols for creating any non-Abelian quantum double of a group with nilpotency class 2 (such as D4 or Q8). We show that after the measurement, the wave function always collapses into the desired non-Abelian topological order, conditional on recording the measurement outcome. Moreover, the clean quantum double ground state can be deterministically prepared via feedforward-gates that depend on the measurement outcomes. Second, we provide the first constructive proof that a finite number of shots can implement the Kramers-Wannier duality transformation (i.e., the gauging map) for any solvable symmetry group. As a special case, this gives an explicit protocol to prepare twisted quantum doubles for all solvable groups. Third, we argue that certain topological orders, such as nonsolvable quantum doubles or Fibonacci anyons, define nontrivial phases of matter under the equivalence class of finite-depth unitaries and measurement, which cannot be prepared by any finite number of shots. Moreover, we explore the consequences of allowing gates to have exponentially small tails, which enables, for example, the preparation of any Abelian anyon theory, including chiral ones. This hierarchy paints a new picture of the landscape of long-range entangled states, with practical implications for quantum simulators.

TI Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer pairing of composite fermions
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
AB Topological pairing of composite fermions has led to remarkable ideas, such as excitations obeying nonAbelian braid statistics and topological quantum computation. We construct a p-wave paired Bardeen-CooperSchrieffer (BCS) wave function for composite fermions in the torus geometry, which is a convenient geometry for formulating momentum space pairing as well as for revealing the underlying composite-fermion Fermi sea. Following the standard BCS approach, we minimize the Coulomb interaction energy at half filling in the lowest and the second Landau levels, which correspond to filling factors nu = 1/2 and nu = 5/2 in GaAs quantum wells, by optimizing two variational parameters that are analogous to the gap and the Debye cutoff energy of the BCS theory. Our results show no evidence for pairing at nu = 1/2 but a clear evidence for pairing at nu = 5/2. To a good approximation, the highest overlap between the exact Coulomb ground state at nu = 5/2 and the BCS state is obtained for parameters that minimize the energy of the latter, thereby providing support for the physics of composite-fermion pairing as the mechanism for the 5/2 fractional quantum Hall effect. We discuss the issue of modular covariance of the composite-fermion BCS wave function, and calculate its Hall viscosity and pair correlation function. By similar methods, we look for but do not find an instability to s-wave pairing for a spin-singlet composite-fermion Fermi sea at half-filled lowest Landau level in a system where the Zeeman splitting has been set to zero.

TI Structural and magnetic properties of molecular beam epitaxy
   (MnSb2Te4)x(Sb2Te3</sub
   >)1-x topological materials with exceedingly high Curie
   temperature
SO APL MATERIALS
AB Tuning the properties of magnetic topological materials is of interest to realize exotic physical phenomena, new quantum phases and quasiparticles, and topological spintronic devices. However, current topological materials exhibit Curie temperature (T-C) values far below those needed for practical applications. In recent years, significant progress has been made to control and optimize T-C, particularly through defect-engineering of these structures. Most recently, we reported TC values up to 80 K for (MnSb2Te4)(x)(Sb2Te3)(1-x) when 0.7 <= x <= 0.85 by controlling the composition x and the Mn content in these structures during molecular beam epitaxy growth. In this study, we show further enhancement of the T-C, as high as 100 K, by maintaining high Mn content and reducing the growth rate from 0.9 nm/min to 0.5 nm/min. Derivative curves of the Hall resistance and the magnetization reveal the presence of two T-C components contributing to the overall value and suggest T-C1 and T-C2 have distinct origins: excess Mn in MnSb2Te4 septuple layers (SLs) and high Mn content in Sb2-yMnyTe3 quintuple layer (QL) alloys, respectively. To elucidate the mechanisms promoting higher T-C values in this system, we show evidence of enhanced structural disorder due to the excess Mn that occupies not only Sb sites but also Te sites, leading to the formation of a new crystal structure for these materials. Learning to control defects that enhance desired magnetic properties and understanding the mechanisms that promote high T-C in magnetic topological materials such as (Mn1+ySb2-yTe4)(x)(Sb(2-y)MnyTe3)1-x is of great importance to achieve practical quantum devices.

TI Phase stability of MoTe2 obtained by tellurization of
   sputtered molybdenum oxide: The influence of the thickness and the
   precursor crystallinity
SO JOURNAL OF SCIENCE-ADVANCED MATERIALS AND DEVICES
AB 1T' and 2H MoTe2 films were obtained by using isothermal close space tellurization of sputtered MoOx films onto amorphous fused silica or (100) oriented silicon substrates. The influence of the thickness and the crystalline state of the precursor thin films in the obtained phase was analyzed. With this aim, precursors films were sputtered with thicknesses ranging from 5 to 40 nm. From each thickness, one sample was annealed in the air before the tellurization process, and the other was tellurized as sputtered. Misoriented and preferentially oriented crystals were found in all samples, according to grazing incidence and theta-20 X-rays diffraction measurements, respectively. For samples prepared onto fused silica substrates, 1T' phase was favored for misoriented crystals except for the samples of the highest thickness tellurized with the annealed thin films precursor. In the case of oriented crystals, they presented a rather different behavior with samples tellurized from annealed precursors preferring the 2H phase. Some experiments performed using crystalline silicon substrates seem to indicate an important influence on the used substrate in the obtained phase. The control of the obtained MoTe2 phase is a relevant subject due to the potential emerging applications of both 1T' and 2H crystalline modifications in the context of topological superconductivity, fault-tolerant topological quantum computation, for example.

TI Observation of fractional edge excitations in nanographene spin chains
SO NATURE
AB Using scanning tunnelling microscopy and spectroscopy, fractional edge excitations are observed in nanographene spin chains, enabling the potential to study strongly correlated phases in purely organic materials.
   Fractionalization is a phenomenon in which strong interactions in a quantum system drive the emergence of excitations with quantum numbers that are absent in the building blocks. Outstanding examples are excitations with charge e/3 in the fractional quantum Hall effect(1,2), solitons in one-dimensional conducting polymers(3,4) and Majorana states in topological superconductors(5). Fractionalization is also predicted to manifest itself in low-dimensional quantum magnets, such as one-dimensional antiferromagnetic S = 1 chains. The fundamental features of this system are gapped excitations in the bulk(6) and, remarkably, S = 1/2 edge states at the chain termini(7-9), leading to a four-fold degenerate ground state that reflects the underlying symmetry-protected topological order(10,11). Here, we use on-surface synthesis(12) to fabricate one-dimensional spin chains that contain the S = 1 polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon triangulene as the building block. Using scanning tunnelling microscopy and spectroscopy at 4.5 K, we probe length-dependent magnetic excitations at the atomic scale in both open-ended and cyclic spin chains, and directly observe gapped spin excitations and fractional edge states therein. Exact diagonalization calculations provide conclusive evidence that the spin chains are described by the S = 1 bilinear-biquadratic Hamiltonian in the Haldane symmetry-protected topological phase. Our results open a bottom-up approach to study strongly correlated phases in purely organic materials, with the potential for the realization of measurement-based quantum computation(13).

TI Adaptive quantum accelerated imaging for space domain awareness
SO NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB The growth in space activity has increased the need for Space Domain Awareness (SDA) to ensure safe space operations. Imaging and detecting space targets is, however, challenging due to their dim appearance, small angular size/separation, dense distribution, and atmospheric turbulence. These challenges render space targets in ground-based imaging observations as point-like objects in the sub-Rayleigh regime, with extreme brightness contrast but a low photon budget. Here, we propose to use the recently developed quantum-accelerated imaging (QAI) for the SDA challenge. We mainly focus on three SDA challenges (1) minimal a priori assumptions (2) many-object problem (3) extreme brightness ratio. We also present results on source estimation and localization in the presence of atmospheric turbulence. QAI shows significantly improved estimation in position, brightness, and number of targets for all SDA challenges. In particular, we demonstrate up to 2.5 times better performance in source detection than highly optimized direct imaging in extreme scenarios like stars with a 1000 times brightness ratio. With over 10 000 simulations, we verify the increased resolution of our approach compared to conventional state-of-the-art direct imaging paving the way towards quantum optics approaches for SDA.

TI Fundamental bounds of wavefront shaping of spatially entangled photons
SO APL PHOTONICS
AB Wavefront shaping enables control of classical light through scattering media. Extending these techniques to spatially entangled photons promises new quantum applications, but their fundamental limits, especially when both photons scatter, remain unclear. Here, we theoretically and numerically investigate the enhancement of two-photon correlations in two specific output modes through thick scattering media. We analyze three configurations: shaping one photon after the medium, shaping both photons before the medium, and shaping both photons after the medium. We show that each configuration yields fundamentally different enhancements compared to classical expectations. For a system with N modes, we show that shaping one photon yields the classical enhancement eta approximate to (pi/4)N, while shaping both photons before the medium reduces it to eta approximate to (pi/4)2 N. However, in some symmetric detection schemes, when both photons are measured at the same mode, perfect correlations are restored with eta approximate to N, resembling digital optical phase conjugation. Conversely, shaping both photons after the medium leads to a complex, NP-hard-like optimization problem, yet achieves superior enhancements, up to eta approximate to 4.6N. These results reveal unique quantum effects in complex media and identify strategies for quantum imaging and communication through scattering environments.

TI Spacetime quantum and classical mechanics with dynamical foliation
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW D
AB The conventional phase space of classical physics treats space and time differently, and this difference carries over to field theories and quantum mechanics (QM). In this paper, the phase space is enhanced through two main extensions. First, we promote the time choice of the Legendre transform to a dynamical variable. Second, we extend the Poisson brackets of matter fields to a spacetime symmetric form. The ensuing "spacetime phase space" is employed to obtain an explicitly covariant version of Hamilton equations for relativistic field theories. A canonical-like quantization of the formalism is then presented in which the fields satisfy spacetime commutation relations and the foliation is quantum. In this approach, the classical action is also promoted to an operator and retains explicit covariance through its nonseparability in the matter-foliation partition. The problem of establishing a correspondence between the new noncausal framework (where fields at different times are independent) and conventional QM is solved through a generalization of spacelike correlators to spacetime. In this generalization, the Hamiltonian is replaced by the action, and conventional particles by off-shell particles. When the foliation is quantized, the previous map is recovered by conditioning on foliation eigenstates, in analogy with the Page and Wootters mechanism. We also provide an interpretation of the correspondence in which the causal structure of a given theory emerges from the quantum correlations between the system and an environment. This idea holds for general quantum systems and allows one to generalize the density matrix to an operator containing the information of correlators both in space and time.

TI Photonic spin Hall effect: fundamentals and emergent applications
SO OPTO-ELECTRONIC SCIENCE
AB The photonic spin Hall effect (SHE) refers to the transverse spin separation of photons with opposite spin angular momentum, after the beam passes through an optical interface or inhomogeneous medium, manifested as the spin-dependent splitting. It can be considered as an analogue of the SHE in electronic systems: the light's right-circularly polarized and left-circularly polarized components play the role of the spin-up and spin-down electrons, and the refractive index gradient replaces the electronic potential gradient. Remarkably, the photonic SHE originates from the spin-orbit interaction of the photons and is mainly attributed to two different geometric phases, i.e., the spin-redirection Rytov-VlasimirskiiBerry in momentum space and the Pancharatnam-Berry phase in Stokes parameter space. The unique properties of the photonic SHE and its powerful ability to manipulate the photon spin, gradually, make it a useful tool in precision metrology, analog optical computing and quantum imaging, etc. In this review, we provide a brief framework to describe the fundamentals and advances of photonic SHE, and give an overview on the emergent applications of this phenomenon in different scenes.

TI Investigation of Gaussian boson sampling under phase noise of the light
   source
SO ACTA PHYSICA SINICA
AB Gaussian boson sampling is one of the main promising approaches to realizing the quantum computational advantage, which also offers potential applications such as in dense subgraphs problem and quantum chemistry. However, the inevitable noise in experiment may weaken the quantum advantage of Gaussian boson sampling. Photon loss and photon partial indistinguishability are two major sources of noise. Their influence on the complexity of Gaussian boson sampling has been extensively studied in previous work. However, the phase noise of the input light source, a noise which is suitable for tailored for Gaussian boson sampling, has not been studied so far. Here, we investigate the phase noise of the input light source in Gaussian boson sampling through numerical simulation. We use the Monte Carlo method to calculate the output probability distribution under phase noise approximately. It is found that the phase noise of the light source can cause the input state to change from a Gaussian state into a non-Gaussian mixed state. For a given phase noise level, the fidelity of the non-Gaussian mixed state and the noise-free ideal state decreases monotonically as the mean photon number of input increases. Meanwhile, owing to the phase noise the deviation of the output probability distribution gradually increases with the number of detected photons increasing. Furthermore, the phase noise results in the capability of heavy sample generation (HOG), significantly decreasing. Finally, it is found that Gaussian boson sampling with photon loss is more tolerant to phase noise than the lossless case given that the mean photon number of input is the same. Our study is helpful in suppressing the phase noise in large-scale Gaussian boson sampling experiments.

TI Effects of multi-photon states in the calibration of single-photon
   detectors based on a portable bi-photon source
SO AVS QUANTUM SCIENCE
AB Single-photon detectors (SPDs) are ubiquitous in many protocols for quantum imaging, sensing, and communications. Many of these protocols critically depend on the precise knowledge of their detection efficiency. A method for the calibration of SPDs based on sources of quantum-correlated photon pairs uses single-photon detection to generate heralded single photons, which can be used as a standard of radiation at the single-photon level. These heralded photons then allow for precise calibration of SPDs in absolute terms. In this work, we investigate the absolute calibration of avalanche photodiodes based on a portable, commercial bi-photon source, and investigate the effects of multi-photon events from the spontaneous parametric down conversion (SPDC) process in these sources. We show that the multi-photon character of the bi-photon source, together with system losses, has a significant impact on the achievable accuracy for the calibration of SPDs. However, modeling the expected photon counting statistics from the squeezed vacuum in the SPDC process allows for accurate estimation of the efficiency of SPDs, assuming that the system losses are known. This study provides essential information for the design and optimization of portable bi-photon sources for their application in on-site calibration of SPDs with high accuracy, without requiring any other reference standard.

TI Examining the effectiveness of increasing EMCCD EM gain beyond standard
   manufacturer limits in determining photon pair correlations
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB Electron multiplying charge coupled device (EMCCD) cameras are widely used for single-photon detection in various quantum optics applications. For example, these EMCCD cameras have been extensively used to measure the position and momentum correlations between photon pairs produced by parametric down-conversion in the image and far-field planes of the down-conversion crystal, respectively. The camera's operating parameters are typically set to balance a high quantum efficiency while simultaneously maintaining a low number of erroneous photon detections, the latter being mainly attributable to clock-induced charge (CIC) events in the readout register. The visibility of the measured correlations is an indication of the quantum efficiency of detecting the photon pairs versus the prevalence of the unwanted CIC. In this work, we show that this correlation visibility can be enhanced by operating the EMCCD camera with the electron multiplying (EM) gain set well in excess of its standard operating conditions. This enhancement will be of interest to those using EMCCD detectors in quantum imaging, sensing and processing applications.

TI Mid-infrared microscopy via position correlations of undetected photons
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB Quantum imaging with undetected photons (QIUP) has recently emerged as a new powerful imaging tool. Exploiting the spatial entanglement of photon pairs, it allows decoupling of the sensing and detection wavelengths, facilitating imaging in otherwise challenging spectral regions by leveraging mature silicon-based detection technology. All existing implementations of QIUP have so far utilised the momentum correlations within the biphoton states produced by spontaneous parametric downconversion. Here, for the first time, we implement and examine theoretically and numerically the complementary scenario - utilising the tight position correlations formed within photon pairs at birth. This image plane arrangement facilitates high resolution imaging with comparative experimental ease, and we experimentally show resolutions below 10 mu m at a sensing wavelength of 3.7 mu m. Moreover, we present a quantitative numerical model predicting the imaging capabilities of QIUP for a wide range of parameters. Finally, by imaging mouse heart tissue at the mid-IR to reveal morphological features on the cellular level, we further demonstrate the viability of this technique for the life sciences. These results offer new perspectives on the capabilities of QIUP for label-free widefield mid-IR microscopy, enabling real-world biomedical as well as industrial imaging applications.

TI D-Branes, AdS/CFT, Dynamical Uhlmann Gauge, and Stabilisation of a
   Closed Causal Loop Geometry
SO UNIVERSE
AB I show here that if we construct D-branes not in the form of infinite superpositions of string modes, in order to satisfy the technical condition of coherence by means of eigenstates of annihilation operators, but instead insist on an approximate but much more physical and practical definition based on phase coherence, we obtain finite (and hence realistic) superpositions of string modes that would form realistic D-branes that would encode (at least as a semiclassical approximation) various quantum properties. Re-deriving the AdS/CFT duality by starting in the pre-Maldacena limit from such realistic D-branes would lead to quantum properties on the AdS side of the duality. Causal structures can be modified in various many-particle systems, including strings, D-branes, photons, or spins; however, there is a distinction between the emergence of an effective causal structure in the inner degrees of freedom of a material, in the form of a correlation-generated effective metric, for example, in a spin liquid system, and the emergence of a causal structure in an open propagating system by using classical light. I will show how an Uhlmann gauge construction would add stability to a modified causal structure that would retain the shape of a closed causal loop. Various other ideas related to the quantum origin of the string length are also discussed and an analogy of the emergence of string length from quantum correlations with the emergence of wavelength of an electromagnetic wave from coherence conditions of photon modes is presented.

TI Collective Neutrino Oscillations and Heavy-element Nucleosynthesis in
   Supernovae: Exploring Potential Effects of Many-body Neutrino
   Correlations
SO ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL
AB In high-energy astrophysical processes involving compact objects, such as core-collapse supernovae or binary neutron star mergers, neutrinos play an important role in the synthesis of nuclides. Neutrinos in these environments can experience collective flavor oscillations driven by neutrino-neutrino interactions, including coherent forward scattering and incoherent (collisional) effects. Recently, there has been interest in exploring potential novel behaviors in collective oscillations of neutrinos by going beyond the one-particle effective or "mean-field" treatments. Here, we seek to explore implications of collective neutrino oscillations, in the mean-field treatment and beyond, for the nucleosynthesis yields in supernova environments with different astrophysical conditions and neutrino inputs. We find that collective oscillations can impact the operation of the nu p-process and r-process nucleosynthesis in supernovae. The potential impact is particularly strong in high-entropy, proton-rich conditions, where we find that neutrino interactions can nudge an initial nu p-process neutron-rich, resulting in a unique combination of proton-rich low-mass nuclei as well as neutron-rich high-mass nuclei. We describe this neutrino-induced neutron-capture process as the "nu i-process." In addition, nontrivial quantum correlations among neutrinos, if present significantly, could lead to different nuclide yields compared to the corresponding mean-field oscillation treatments, by virtue of modifying the evolution of the relevant one-body neutrino observables.

TI Out-of-equilibrium dynamics of quantum many-body systems with long-range
   interactions
SO PHYSICS REPORTS-REVIEW SECTION OF PHYSICS LETTERS
AB Experimental progress in atomic, molecular, and optical platforms in the last decadehas stimulated strong and broad interest in the quantum coherent dynamics of manylong-range interactingparticles. The prominent collective character of these systems en-ables novel non-equilibrium phenomena with no counterpart in conventional quantumsystems with local interactions. Much of the theory work in this area either focussedon the impact of variable-range interaction tails on the physics of local interactions orrelied on mean-field-like descriptions based on the opposite limit of all-to-all infinite-range interactions. In this Report, we present a systematic and organic review of recentadvances in the field. Working with prototypical interacting quantum spin latticeswithout disorder, our presentation hinges upon a versatile theoretical formalism thatinterpolates between the few-body mean-field physics and the many-body physics ofquasi-local interactions. Such a formalism allows us to connect these two regimes,providing both a formal quantitative tool and basic physical intuition. We leveragethis unifying framework to review several findings of the last decade, including thepeculiar non-ballistic spreading of quantum correlations, counter-intuitive slowdownof entanglement dynamics, suppression of thermalization and equilibration, anomalousscaling of defects upon traversing criticality, dynamical phase transitions, and genuinelynon-equilibrium phases stabilized by periodic driving. The style of this Report is on thepedagogical side, which makes it accessible to readers without previous experience inthe subject matter.

TI Sensor-Equipped Unmanned Surface Vehicle for High-Resolution Mapping of
   Water Quality in Low- to Mid-Order Streams
SO ACS ES&T WATER
AB Longitudinal profiling of water quality via the deployment of sensors from watercraft has advanced the understanding of spatial patterns in large rivers and lakes; however, a similar approach in low-to mid-order streams is lacking. To fill this gap, we developed an unmanned surface vehicle (USV)-water quality measurement platform (the "AquaBOT"). The components of the AquaBOT included a nitrate sensor, multiparameter sonde (temperature, conductivity, turbidity, dissolved oxygen, chlorophyll), quantum sensor, and global positioning system (GPS) mounted to a small pontoon-style USV. The AquaBOT was tested in four streams and rivers in Iowa and Tennessee. All measured water quality parameters varied longitudinally, and greater ranges were generally observed along the low-order, agriculturally influenced streams in Iowa. Nitrate, in particular, was spatially heterogeneous. For example, during one run in early June, concentrations ranged from 10.5 to 12.5 mg N L-1 along a 2.3 km reach and hotspots were observed directly downstream of some tile drains. The spatial resolution of AquaBOT data collected in June was 10x higher than grab sampling data, and measurements were collected in less time and at a comparable cost. The AquaBOT can complement existing measurement approaches and will lead to advancements in understanding the processes driving water quality along the stream-to river continuum.

TI Exactly solvable dissipative dynamics and one-form strong-to-weak
   spontaneous symmetry breaking in interacting two-dimensional spin
   systems
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
AB We study the dissipative dynamics of a class of interacting "gamma-matrix" spin models coupled to a Markovian environment. For spins on an arbitrary graph, we construct a Lindbladian that maps to a non-Hermitian model of free Majorana fermions hopping on the graph with a background classical Z2 gauge field. We show, analytically and numerically, that the steady states and relaxation dynamics are qualitatively independent of the choice of the underlying graph, in stark contrast to the Hamiltonian case. We also show that the exponentially many steady states provide a concrete example of mixed-state topological order, in the sense of strong-to-weak spontaneous symmetry breaking of a one-form symmetry. While encoding only classical information, the steady states still exhibit long-range quantum correlations. Afterward, we examine the relaxation processes toward the steady state by numerically computing decay rates, which we generically find to be finite, even in the dissipationless limit. However, we identify symmetry sectors where fermion-parity conservation is enhanced to fermion-number conservation, where we can analytically bound the decay rates and prove that they vanish in the limits of both infinitely weak and infinitely strong dissipation. Finally, we show that while the choice of coherent dynamics is very flexible, exact solvability strongly constrains the allowed form of dissipation. Our work establishes an analytically tractable framework to explore nonequilibrium quantum phases of matter and the relaxation mechanisms toward them.

TI Optimizing Data Processing for Nanodiamond Based Relaxometry
SO ADVANCED QUANTUM TECHNOLOGIES
AB The nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center in diamond is a powerful and versatile quantum sensor for diverse quantities. In particular, relaxometry (or T1), can be used to detect magnetic noise at the nanoscale. For experiments with single NV centers the analysis of the data is well established. However, due to relatively low brightness and reproducibility it is beneficial for biological experiments to use ensembles. While increasing the number of NV centers in a nanodiamond leads to more signal, a standardized method to extract information from relaxometry experiments is still missing. This article uses T1 relaxation curves acquired at different concentrations of gadolinium ions to calibrate and optimize the entire data processing flow, from the acquired raw data to the extracted T1. In particular, a bootstrap is used to derive a signal to noise ratio (SNR) that can be quantitatively compared from one method to another. At first, T1 curves are extracted from photoluminescence pulses. This work compares integrating their signal through an optimized window as performed conventionally, to fitting a known function on it. Fitting the decaying T1 curves leads to the relevant T1 value. This work compares here the three most commonly used fit models that are, single, bi, and stretched exponential. This work finally investigates the effect of the bootstrap itself on the precision of the result as well as the use of a rolling window to increase time resolution.

TI Contactless measurement of muscle fiber conduction velocity-a novel
   approach using optically pumped magnetometers
SO JOURNAL OF NEURAL ENGINEERING
AB Objective. Muscle fiber conduction velocity (MFCV) describes the speed at which electrical activity propagates along muscle fibers and is typically assessed using invasive or surface electromyography. Because electrical currents generate magnetic fields, propagation velocity can potentially also be measured magnetically using magnetomyography (MMG), offering the advantage of a contactless approach. Approach. To test this hypothesis, we recorded MMG signals from the right biceps brachii muscle of 24 healthy subjects (12 male, 12 female) using a linear array of seven optically pumped magnetometers (OPMs). Subjects maintained muscle force for 30 s at 20%, 40%, and 60% of their maximum voluntary contraction. Main results. In 20 subjects, propagation of MMG signals was observable. Change in polarity and signal cancellation enabled localization of the innervation zone. We estimated the MFCV for each condition by cross-correlating double-differentiated MMG signals. To validate our results, we examined whether MFCV estimations increased with higher force levels, a well-documented characteristic of the neuromuscular system. The median MFCV significantly increased with force (p = 0.007), with median values of 3.2 m s -1 at 20%, 3.8 m s -1 at 40%, and 4.4 m s -1 at 60% across all 20 subjects. Significance. Our results establish the first measurements of magnetic MFCV in MMG using OPMs. These findings pave the way for further developments and application of quantum sensors for contactless clinical neurophysiology.

TI Random noise taming under phase control: spectral manipulation of an
   optically pumped atomic magnetometer by random telegraph noise
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB Optically pumped atomic magnetometer (OPAM), as a highly sensitive quantum sensor, is often significantly disturbed by low-frequency random noise, which seriously limits its measurement robustness. Motivated by this problem, we systematically studied the influence of various parameters of the statistical field related to random telegraph noise (RTN) on the dynamics and spectral characteristics of the OPAM, both theoretically and experimentally. The investigation revealed that the OPAM output spectrum shows a phase sensitivity similar to that induced by the squeezed vacuum field to the relative phase phi between the statistical field and the coherent driving field, and its physical essence originates from the phase-dependent reservoir formed by the statistical field. Specifically, the system spectrum is periodically modulated to phi, showing complementary regulation behavior of spectral peak and linewidth: when phi = 90 degrees, the system is almost insensitive to the RTN noise parameters, showing good robustness; however, when phi = 0 degrees, the system is highly responsive to the RTN parameters, showing obvious spectral broadening effect. Our results not only provide what we believe to be a new phase control strategy for the optimization of the OPAM under the background of low-frequency noise, but also provide theoretical and experimental path for the development of noise spectrum precision measurement and dynamical decoupling technology based on OPAM.

TI Thermal Atoms Facilitate Intensity Clipping Between Vectorial Dual-Beam
   Generated by a Single Metasurface Chip
SO ADVANCED SCIENCE
AB Manipulating vector beams is pivotal in fields such as particle manipulation, image processing, and quantum communication. Flexibly adjusting the intensity distribution of these beams is crucial for effectively realizing these applications. This study introduces a vectorial dual-beam system utilizing thermal atoms as the medium for modulating the intensity profile of vector beams. A single metasurface is employed to generate both the control and signal vector beams, each with unique vectorial characteristics. The shaping of the signal beam profile is facilitated by the interaction with thermal atoms, which can be controlled by adjusting the control vector beam. This spatially selective absorption is a result of the thermal atoms' response to the varying polarizations within the vector beams. In this experiment, two distinct metasurface chips are fabricated to generate vector beams with doughnut-shaped and Gaussian-shaped intensity profiles. By adjusting the incident power and polarization state of the control light, the doughnut-shaped signal beams can be converted into a rotational dual-lobed pattern or the dimensions of the Gaussian-distributed signal beams can be modified. This study introduces a novel vector beam shaping technique by integrating metasurfaces with thermal atoms, offering significant promise for future applications requiring miniaturization, dynamic operation, and versatile control capabilities.

AB Deployed optical clocks will improve positioning for navigational autonomy 1 , provide remote time standards for geophysical monitoring 2 and distributed coherent sensing 3 , allow time synchronization of remote quantum networks 4,5 and provide operational redundancy for national time standards. Although laboratory optical clocks now reach fractional inaccuracies below 10-18 (refs. 6,7 ), transportable versions of these high-performing clocks 8,9 have limited utility because of their size, environmental sensitivity and cost 10 . Here we report the development of optical clocks with the requisite combination of size, performance and environmental insensitivity for operation on mobile platforms. The 35 l clock combines a molecular iodine spectrometer, fibre frequency comb and control electronics. Three of these clocks operated continuously aboard a naval ship in the Pacific Ocean for 20 days while accruing timing errors below 300 ps per day. The clocks have comparable performance to active hydrogen masers in one-tenth the volume. Operating high-performance clocks at sea has been historically challenging and continues to be critical for navigation. This demonstration marks a significant technological advancement that heralds the arrival of future optical timekeeping networks.

TI Multicolored unidirectional reflection amplification based on two-photon
   resonance in the defective atomic lattice
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB Improving the performance of non-reciprocal photonic devices is one of the key factors for promoting the development of quantum networks. To achieve this goal, we propose a scheme to realize multicolored unidirectional reflection amplification in the defective atomic lattice, with all atoms trapped in each filled lattice cell being driven into a four-level diamond-type coherent gain atomic system by two coupling fields and two probe fields. Therefore, this scheme simultaneously achieves light amplification (resulting from the joint effect of the coherent gain atomic system and the distributed feedback mechanism of the atomic lattice) and non-reciprocity (arising from the symmetry-breaking effect of the defective atomic lattice) in a single physical system. Furthermore, we propose a reasonable scheme for obtaining equivalent results by reducing the energy level structure, and through numerical simulations and calculations, it is concluded that perfect unidirectional reflection amplification requires that the two-photon resonance is not only located in the gain region, but also satisfies the Bragg condition. This scheme can be used to design non-reciprocal photonic devices that are easily integrable, high-efficiency, and capable of flexible multi-channel manipulation.

TI A δ-free approach to quantization of transmission lines connected
   to lumped circuits
SO PHYSICA SCRIPTA
AB The quantization of systems composed of transmission lines connected to lumped circuits poses significant challenges, arising from the interaction between continuous and discrete degrees of freedom. A widely adopted strategy, based on the pioneering work of Yurke and Denker, entails representing the lumped circuit contributions using Lagrangian densities that incorporate Dirac delta-functions. However, this approach introduces complications, as highlighted in the recent literature, including divergent momentum densities, necessitating the use of regularization techniques. In this work, we introduce a delta-free Lagrangian formulation for a transmission line capacitively coupled to a lumped circuit without the need for a discretization of the transmission line or mode expansions. This is achieved by explicitly enforcing boundary conditions at the line ends in the principle of least action. In this framework, the quantization and the derivation of the Heisenberg equations of the network are straightforward. We obtain a reduced model for the lumped circuit in the quantum Langevin form, which is valid for any coupling strength between the line and the lumped circuit. We apply our approach to an analytically solvable network consisting of a semi-infinite transmission line capacitively coupled to an LC circuit and study the behavior of the network as the coupling strength varies.

TI Deep Link Entropy for Quantifying Edge Significance in Social Networks
SO APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL
AB Through online political communications, fragmented groups appear around ideological lines, which might form echo chambers if the communications within like-minded groups are dominant over the communications among different-minded groups, potentially contributing to political polarization and extremism. The antidote is the interactions between individuals who constitute social bridges between different minded groups. Hence, exploring the significance of connections between the individuals of a network is a center of attraction especially for the global connectivity and diffusion in networks. Based on the divergence of probability distributions of pairs of nodes, Link Entropy (LE) is a recently proposed method outperforming the others in quantifying edge significance. In this work, considering that the adjacent nodes of the two nodes of an edge are also in charge in determining its significance, we propose the Deep Link Entropy (DLE) method for a more precise quantification through taking into account the uncertainty distributions of the adjacent nodes as well. We show experimentally that DLE significantly outperforms LE especially in large-scale complex network with several groups or communities. We believe our method contributes to not only online political communications but a wide range of fields from biology to quantum networks, where edge significance has an operational meaning.

TI From Fibonacci Anyons to B-DNA and Microtubules via Elliptic Curves
SO QUANTUM REPORTS
AB By imposing finite order constraints on Fibonacci anyon braid relations, we construct the finite quotient G=Z5 & rtimes;2I, where 2I is the binary icosahedral group. The Gr & ouml;bner basis decomposition of its SL(2,C) character variety yields elliptic curves whose L-function derivatives L '(E,1) remarkably match fundamental biological structural ratios. Specifically, we demonstrate that the Birch-Swinnerton-Dyer conjecture's central quantity: the derivative L '(E,1) of the L-function at 1 encodes critical cellular geometries: the crystalline B-DNA pitch-to-diameter ratio (L '(E,1)=1.730 matching 34 & Aring;/20 & Aring;=1.70), the B-DNA pitch to major groove width (L '=1.58) and, additionally, the fundamental cytoskeletal scaling relationship where L '(E,1)=3.570 approximate to 25/7, precisely matching the microtubule-to-actin diameter ratio. This pattern extends across the hierarchy Z5 & rtimes;2P with 2P is an element of{2O,2T,2I} (binary octahedral, tetrahedral, icosahedral groups), where character tables of 2O explain genetic code degeneracies while 2T yields microtubule ratios. The convergence of multiple independent mathematical pathways on identical biological values suggests that evolutionary optimization operates under deep arithmetic-geometric constraints encoded in elliptic curve L-functions. Our results position the BSD conjecture not merely as abstract number theory, but as encoding fundamental organizational principles governing cellular architecture. The correspondence reveals arithmetic geometry as the mathematical blueprint underlying major biological structural systems, with Gross-Zagier theory providing the theoretical framework connecting quantum topology to the helical geometries that are essential for life.

TI Proximity-induced chiral quantum light generation in strain-engineered
   WSe2/NiPS3 heterostructures
SO NATURE MATERIALS
AB Quantum light emitters capable of generating single photons with circular polarization and non-classical statistics could enable non-reciprocal single-photon devices and deterministic spin-photon interfaces for quantum networks. To date, the emission of such chiral quantum light relies on the application of intense external magnetic fields, electrical/optical injection of spin-polarized carriers/excitons or coupling with complex photonic metastructures. Here we report the creation of free-space chiral quantum light emitters via the nanoindentation of monolayer WSe2/NiPS3 heterostructures at zero external magnetic field. These quantum light emitters emit with a high degree of circular polarization (0.89) and single-photon purity (95%), independent of pump laser polarization. Scanning diamond nitrogen-vacancy microscopy and temperature-dependent magneto-photoluminescence studies reveal that the chiral quantum light emission arises from magnetic proximity interactions between localized excitons in the WSe2 monolayer and the out-of-plane magnetization of defects in the antiferromagnetic order of NiPS3, both of which are co-localized by strain fields associated with the nanoscale indentations.
   Proximity-induced chiral quantum emission is generated by applying nanoindentation on monolayer WSe2 on an antiferromagnetic van der Waals material (NiPS3) at zero external magnetic fields, reporting a degree of circular polarization of 0.89 and a single-photon purity of 95%.

TI High-Fidelity Interconversion between Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger and W
   States through Floquet-Lindblad Engineering in Rydberg Atom Arrays
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW APPLIED
AB Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger and W states feature genuine tripartite entanglement that cannot be con-verted into each other by local operations and classical communication. Here, we present a dissipative protocol for deterministic interconversion between Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger and W states of three neutral 87Rb atoms arranged in an equilateral triangle of a two-dimensional array. With three atomic levels and diagonal van der Waals interactions of Rydberg atoms, the interconversion between tripartite entan-gled states can be efficiently accomplished in the Floquet-Lindblad framework through the periodic optical pump and dissipation engineering. We evaluate the feasibility of the existing methodology using the exper-imental parameters accessible to current neutral-atom platforms. We find that our scheme is robust against typical noises, such as laser phase noise and geometric imperfections of the atom array. In addition, our scheme can integrate the Gaussian soft quantum control technique, which further reduces the overall conversion time and increases the resilience to timing errors and interatomic distance fluctuations. The high-fidelity and robust tripartite entanglement interconversion protocol provides a route to save physical resources and enhance the computational efficiency of quantum networks formed by neutral-atom arrays.

TI Single tin-vacancy center in nanoscale diamond
SO DISCOVER NANO
AB Group-IV color centers in diamonds are promising not only as spin-photon interfaces for quantum networks but also as multicolor photoluminescence probes and all-optical temperature sensors for biological research. Therefore, generating group-IV color centers in detonation nanodiamonds (DNDs), the smallest class of diamond nanocrystals, has become a research focal point. This approach holds potential for the noninvasive introduction of diamond sensors into living cell organelles, enabling sensing of local structural and temperature changes with minimal disturbance. Following the successful generation of silicon- and germanium-vacancy centers in DNDs, the generation of tin-vacancy (SnV) centers was investigated. Similar to other group-IV color centers, the SnV centers exhibit strong photoluminescence. In addition, the SnV center offers a long spin coherence time compared with those of silicon- and germanium-vacancy centers. However, the strain induced by large Sn atoms poses substantial challenges for generating SnV centers in ultrasmall nanodiamonds. In this study, Sn-doped DNDs with a mean particle size of similar to 5 nm were subjected to a 3 days boiling acid treatment, which led to sharp zero-phonon lines of SnV centers at similar to 620 nm in the photoluminescence spectra. Photon autocorrelation measurements further revealed the presence of single SnV centers in these DNDs.

TI Interference-induced directional emission from an unpolarized two-level
   emitter into a circulating cavity
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Chiral coupling between quantum emitters and evanescent fields allows directional emission into nanophotonic devices and is now considered to be a vital ingredient for the realization of quantum networks. However, such coupling requires a well-defined circular dipole moment for the emitter???something difficult to achieve for solid-state emitters at room temperature due to thermal population of available spin states. Here, we demonstrate that a two-level emitter with a randomly polarized dipole moment can be made to emit directionally into a circulating cavity if a separate emitter is chirally coupled to the same cavity, for the case when both emitter-cavity couplings are strong but in the bad-cavity regime. Our analysis of this system first considers a transient scenario, which highlights the physical mechanism giving rise to the directional emission of the two-level emitter into the cavity. An alternative setup involving a weak laser field continuously driving the system is also considered, where the directionality (our proposed figure of merit for this scheme) is shown to be significantly more robust against noise processes. The results presented here take the form of approximate analytical expressions backed by complete numerical simulations of the system.

TI Spiderweb Nanomechanical Resonators via Bayesian Optimization: Inspired
   by Nature and Guided by Machine Learning
SO ADVANCED MATERIALS
AB From ultrasensitive detectors of fundamental forces to quantum networks and sensors, mechanical resonators are enabling next-generation technologies to operate in room-temperature environments. Currently, silicon nitride nanoresonators stand as a leading microchip platform in these advances by allowing for mechanical resonators whose motion is remarkably isolated from ambient thermal noise. However, to date, human intuition has remained the driving force behind design processes. Here, inspired by nature and guided by machine learning, a spiderweb nanomechanical resonator is developed that exhibits vibration modes, which are isolated from ambient thermal environments via a novel "torsional soft-clamping" mechanism discovered by the data-driven optimization algorithm. This bioinspired resonator is then fabricated, experimentally confirming a new paradigm in mechanics with quality factors above 1 billion in room-temperature environments. In contrast to other state-of-the-art resonators, this milestone is achieved with a compact design that does not require sub-micrometer lithographic features or complex phononic bandgaps, making it significantly easier and cheaper to manufacture at large scales. These results demonstrate the ability of machine learning to work in tandem with human intuition to augment creative possibilities and uncover new strategies in computing and nanotechnology.

TI Unconventional and robust light-matter interactions based on the
   non-Hermitian skin effect
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Lattice models featuring the non-Hermitian skin effect have attracted rapidly growing interest due to their nontrivial spectral topology and the exotic field dynamics they enable. Such non-Hermitian lattices provide a promising paradigm for engineering exotic light-matter interactions which benefit from the intrinsic chirality and unconventional (non-Bloch) band theory. Here we study a series of unconventional light-matter interactions between quantum emitters and the prototypical Hatano-Nelson model, and briefly discuss the case with an extended lattice model dubbed the bosonic Kitaev chain. We focus on the robustness of the dynamics against various imperfections and elucidate the underlying mechanisms. We consider both small emitters, which interact with the lattice at single sites, and giant emitters, coupling at multiple sites. The latter exhibit an exclusive amplification mechanism, which we find enables decoherence-free dynamics even in the presence of extra dissipation in the system. The protection from dissipation arises from the cooperation of the non-Hermiticity and the self-interference effect, and is therefore lacking for small emitters. These results not only provide deeper insights into the interplay of non-Hermiticity and various interference effects, but also have potential applications in engineering exotic spin Hamiltonians and quantum networks.

TI Long distance all-optical logic operations through a single multimode
   fiber empowered by wavefront shaping
SO PHOTONICS RESEARCH
AB Multimode fibers (MMFs) are a promising solution for high -throughput signal transmission in the time domain. However, crosstalk among different optical modes within the MMF scrambles input information and creates seemingly random speckle patterns at the output. To characterize this process, a transmission matrix (TM) can be used to relate input and output fields. Recent innovations use TMs to manipulate the output field by shaping the input wavefront for exciting advances in deep -brain imaging, neuron stimulation, quantum networks, and analog operators. However, these approaches consider input/output segments as independent, limiting their use for separate signal processing, such as logic operations. Our proposed method, which makes input/output segments as interdependent, adjusts the phase of corresponding output fields using phase bias maps superimposed on input segments. Coherent superposition enables signal logic operations through a 15 -m -long MMF. In experiments, a single optical logic gate containing three basic logic functions and cascading multiple logic gates to handle binary operands is demonstrated. Bitwise operations are performed for multi -bit logic operations, and multiple optical logic gates are reconstructed simultaneously in a single logic gate with polarization multiplexing. The proposed method may open new avenues for long-range logic signal processing and transmission via MMFs. (c) 2024 Chinese Laser Press

TI Scalable photonic integrated circuits for high-fidelity light control
SO OPTICA
AB Advances in laser technology have driven discoveries in atomic, molecular, and optical (AMO) physics and emerging applications, from quantum computers with cold atoms or ions, to quantum networks with solid-state color centers. This progress is motivating the development of a new generation of optical control systems that can manipulate the light field with high fidelity at wavelengths relevant for AMO applications. These systems are characterized by criteria: (C1) operation at a design wavelength of choice in the visible (VIS) or near-infrared (IR) spectrum, (C2) a scalable platform that can support large channel counts, (C3) high-intensity modulation extinction and (C4) repeatability compatible with low gate errors, and (C5) fast switching times. Here, we provide a pathway to address these challenges by introducing an atom control architecture based on VIS-IR photonic integrated circuit (PIC) technology. Based on a complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor fabrication process, this atom-control PIC (APIC) technology can meet system requirements (C1)-(C5). As a proof of concept, we demonstrate a 16-channel silicon-nitride-based APIC with (5.8 +/- 0.4) ns response times and >30 dB extinction ratio at a wavelength of 780 nm.

TI Polarization Decoupling Multi-Port Beam-Splitting Metasurface for
   Miniaturized Magneto-Optical Trap
SO ADVANCED SCIENCE
AB In regular magneto-optical trap (MOT) systems, the delivery of six circularly polarized (CP) cooling beams requires complex and bulky optical arrangements including waveplates, mirrors, retroreflectors, etc. To address such technique challenges, a beam delivery system for miniaturized MOT is proposed entirely based on meta-devices. The key component is a novel polarization decoupling multi-port beam-splitting (PD-MPBS) metasurface that relies on both propagation phase and geometric phase. The fabricated samples exhibit high beam-splitting power uniformity (within 4.4%) and polarization purities (91.3-93.2%). By leveraging such a beam-splitting device as well as a reflective beam-expanding meta-device, an integrated six-beam delivery system for miniaturized MOT application is implemented. The experimental results indicate that six expanded beams have been successfully delivered with uniform power (within 9.5%), the desired CP configuration, and a large overlapping volume (76.2 mm3). It is believed that a miniaturized MOT with the proposed beam delivery system is very promising for portable application of cold atom technology in precision measurement, atomic clock, quantum simulation, and computing, etc.

TI Phonon coupling versus pure dephasing in the photon statistics of
   cooperative emitters
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Realizing scalable quantum networks requires a meticulous level of understanding and mitigating the delete-rious effects of decoherence. Many quantum device platforms feature multiple decoherence mechanisms, often with a dominant mechanism seemingly fully masking others. In this paper, we show how access to weaker dephasing mechanisms can nevertheless be obtained for optically active qubits by performing two-photon coin-cidence measurements. To this end we theoretically investigate the impact of different decoherence mechanisms on cooperatively emitting quantum dots. Focusing on the typically dominant deformation-potential coupling to longitudinal acoustic phonons and typically much less severe additional sources of pure dephasing, we employ a numerically exact method to show that these mechanisms lead to very different two-photon coincidence signals. Moreover, surprisingly, the impact of the strongly coupled phonon environment is weak and leads to long-lived coherences. We trace this back to the superohmic nature of the deformation-potential coupling causing interemitter coherences to converge to a nonzero value on a short timescale, whereas pure dephasing contributions cause a complete decay of coherence over longer times. Our approach provides a practical means of investigating decoherence processes on different timescales in solid-state emitters, and thus contributes to understanding and possibly eliminating their detrimental influences.

AB We report the quantum correlated triple beams via cascaded four-wave mixing (CFWM) amplified in single hot atomic vapor. Experimentally, we show that strong quantum correlation of three light beams, among them any two's quantum correlation is characterized by the maximum value of intensity-difference squeezing (IDS) about -7.8 +/- 0.3 dB. We found there is IDS between two idler beams, because two pairs of Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen injections potentially exist in our system. Besides, CFWM can emit three-mode beams at three different frequencies, in which these beams can be well separated in the spatial domain. Moreover, much difference with other methods, the injecting probe field can manipulate the gain and IDS of output three-mode light beams, which is resulting from competition relationship between cascaded two four-wave mixing processes. More interestingly, Autler-Townes splitting of gain peaks of output signals due to dressing effect of pumping fields, will lead to the evolution of measured two- and three-mode IDS from single-mode to multi-mode at frequency domain. This result will provide a multimode quantum resource which can potentially realize multimode entanglement and quantum networks.

TI Quantum-Inspired Neural Network Model of Optical Illusions
SO ALGORITHMS
AB Ambiguous optical illusions have been a paradigmatic object of fascination, research and inspiration in arts, psychology and video games. However, accurate computational models of perception of ambiguous figures have been elusive. In this paper, we design and train a deep neural network model to simulate human perception of the Necker cube, an ambiguous drawing with several alternating possible interpretations. Defining the weights of the neural network connection using a quantum generator of truly random numbers, in agreement with the emerging concepts of quantum artificial intelligence and quantum cognition, we reveal that the actual perceptual state of the Necker cube is a qubit-like superposition of the two fundamental perceptual states predicted by classical theories. Our results finds applications in video games and virtual reality systems employed for training of astronauts and operators of unmanned aerial vehicles. They are also useful for researchers working in the fields of machine learning and vision, psychology of perception and quantum-mechanical models of human mind and decision making.

TI Single-spin Landau-Zener-St?ckelberg-Majorana interferometry of
   Zeeman-split states with strong spin-orbit interaction in a double
   quantum dot
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
AB Single-spin state evolution induced by the Landau-Zener-Stuckelberg-Majorana (LZSM) interference in a Zeeman-spit four-level system in a periodically driven double quantum dot is studied theoretically by the Floquet stroboscopic method. An interplay between spin-conserving and spin-flip tunneling processes with the electric dipole spin resonance (EDSR) that is induced in an individual dot and enhanced by the LZSM multiple level crossings with the neighboring quantum dot is investigated as a function of the microwave (MW) frequency, driving amplitude, interdot detuning, and magnetic field. A number of special points in the parameter space are identified, out of which all three features are merged. Under this triple-crossing resonance condition, the interdot tunneling is combined with a fast spin evolution in each dot at the EDSR frequency. Harmonics of the EDSR are revealed in the spin-dependent tunneling maps versus variable magnetic field and MW frequency. The results are applicable for both electron and hole systems with strong spin-orbit interaction and may be useful for developing new time-efficient schemes of the spin control and readout in qubit devices.

TI Regularized dynamical decoupling noise spectroscopy - a decoherence
   descriptor for radicals in glassy matrices
SO PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY CHEMICAL PHYSICS
AB Decoherence arises from a fluctuating spin environment, captured by its noise spectrum S(omega). Dynamical decoupling (DD) with n pi pulses extends the dephasing time if the associated filter function attenuates S(omega). Inversely, DD noise spectroscopy (DDNS) reconstructs S(omega) from DD data by approximating the filters pass band by a delta-function. This restricts application to qubit-like spin systems with inherently long dephasing times and/or many applicable pulses. We introduce regularized DDNS to lift this limitation and thereby infer S(omega) from DD traces of paramagnetic centers in glassy o-terphenyl and water-glycerol matrices recorded with n <= 5. For nitroxide radicals at low temperatures, we utilize deuteration to identify distinct matrix- and spin center-induced spectral features. The former extends up to a matrix-specific cut-off frequency and characterizes nuclear spin diffusion. We demonstrate that rotational tunneling of intramolecular methyl groups drives the latter process, whereas at elevated temperatures S(omega) reflects the classical methyl group reorientation. Ultimately, S(omega) visualizes and quantifies variations in the electron spins couplings and thus reports on the underlying spin dynamics as a powerful decoherence descriptor.

TI Manipulating solid-state spin concentration through charge transport
SO PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF
   AMERICA
AB Solid-state defects are attractive platforms for quantum sensing and simulation, e.g., in exploring many-body physics and quantum hydrodynamics. However, many interesting properties can be revealed only upon changes in the density of defects, which instead is usually fixed in material systems. Increasing the interaction strength by creating denser defect ensembles also brings more decoherence. Ideally one would like to control the spin concentration at will while keeping fixed decoherence effects. Here, we show that by exploiting charge transport, we can take some steps in this direction, while at the same time characterizing charge transport and its capture by defects. By exploiting the cycling process of ionization and recombination of NV centers in diamond, we pump electrons from the valence band to the conduction band. These charges are then transported to modulate the spin concentration by changing the charge state of material defects. By developing a wide-field imaging setup integrated with a fast single photon detector array, we achieve a direct and efficient characterization of the charge redistribution process by measuring the complete spectrum of the spin bath with micrometer-scale spatial resolution. We demonstrate a two-fold concentration increase of the dominant spin defects while keeping the T-2 of the NV center relatively unchanged, which also provides a potential experimental demonstration of the suppression of spin flip-flops via hyperfine interactions. Our work paves the way to studying many-body dynamics with temporally and spatially tunable interaction strengths in hybrid charge-spin systems.

   Directions of Tactile Internet and Immersive Communications
SO FUTURE INTERNET
AB Tactile Internet (TI) is an innovative paradigm for emerging generations of communication systems that support ultra-low latency and highly robust transmission of haptics, actuation, and immersive communication in real time. It is considered a critical facilitator for remote surgery, industrial automation, and extended reality (XR). Originally intended as a flagship application for the fifth-generation (5G) networks, their strict constraints, especially the one-millisecond end-to-end latency, ultra-high reliability, and seamless adaptation, present formidable challenges. These challenges are the bottleneck for evolution to sixth-generation (6G) networks; thus, new architects and technologies are urgently required. This survey systematically discusses the most important underlying technologies for TI and immersive communications. It especially highlights using software-defined networking (SDN) and edge intelligence (EI) as enabling technologies. SDN improves the programmability, adaptability, and dynamic control of network infrastructures. In contrast, EI exploits intelligence-based artificial intelligence (AI)-driven decision-making at the network edge for latency optimization, resource usage, and service offering. Moreover, this work describes other enabling technologies, including network function virtualization (NFV), digital twin, quantum computing, and blockchain. Furthermore, the work investigates the recent achievements and studies in which SDN and EI are combined in TI and presents their effect on latency reduction, optimum network utilization, and service stability. A comparison of several State-of-the-Art methods is performed to determine present limitations and gaps. Finally, the work provides open research problems and future trends, focusing on the importance of intelligent, autonomous, and scalable network topologies for defining the paradigm of TI and immersive communication systems.

TI From sensing to energy savings: A comprehensive survey on integrating
   emerging technologies for energy efficiency in WBANs
SO DIGITAL COMMUNICATIONS AND NETWORKS
AB Energy is essential for human existence, and its high consumption is a growing concern in today's technology-driven society. Global initiatives aim to reduce energy consumption and pollution by developing and deploying energy-efficient sensing technologies for long-term monitoring, control, automation, security, and interactions. Wireless Body Area Networks (WBANs) benefit a lot from the continuous monitoring capabilities of these sensing devices, which include medical sensors worn on or implanted in the human body for healthcare monitoring. Despite significant advancements, achieving energy efficiency in WBANs remains a significant challenge. A deep understanding of the WBAN architecture is essential to identify the causes of its energy inefficiency and develop novel energy-efficient solutions. We investigate energy efficiency issues specific to WBANs. We discuss the transformative impact that artificial intelligence and Machine Learning (ML) can have on achieving the energy efficiency of WBANs. Additionally, we explore the potential of emerging technologies such as quantum computing, nano-technology, biocompatible energy harvesting, and Simultaneous Wireless Information and Power Transfer (SWIPT) in enabling energy efficiency in WBANs. We focus on WBANs' architecture, hardware, and software components to identify key factors responsible for energy consumption in the WBAN environment. Based on our comprehensive review, we introduce an innovative, energy-efficient three-tier architecture for WBANs that employs ML and edge computing to overcome the limitations inherent in existing energy-efficient solutions. Finally, we summarize the lessons learned and highlight future research directions that will enable the development of energy-efficient solutions for WBANs.

TI An Efficient Quantum Blockchain Framework With Edge Computing for
   Privacy-Preserving 6G Networks
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB The advent of 6G networks places very high demands on ultra-low latency, high throughput, and quantum-secure communication to power Industry 5.0 use cases. Traditional blockchain architectures, given their decentralized and secure nature, often fall short in meeting the performance and security requirements of such an ecosystem. In this paper, we present a post-quantum blockchain architecture that employs CRYSTALS-Dilithium and SPHINCS+ for digital signatures and block and transaction verification, respectively, along with zk-STARKs to facilitate scalable zero-knowledge proof-based privacy, and a DPoS+VDFs consensus protocol to satisfy fairness and efficiency. We prototyped and evaluated the proposed framework with a benchmarking setup composed of Python, PQClean, liboqs, and Google Benchmark tools. Experimental results demonstrate that the system achieves a 40% reduction in latency, a 35% increase in transaction throughput, and a 25% reduction in computational overhead due to the integration of zk-STARK. Furthermore, finality time for consensus was reduced by 30% by using the hybrid DPoS-VDF consensus approach. Comparative studies with various lattice-, hash-, and code-based quantum cryptographic primitives have shown that CRYSTALS-Dilithium and SPHINCS+ outperform others in key generation, signing, and verification performance indicators, and thus qualify as optimal solutions for edge-centric 6G infrastructures. Conversely, zk-Starks showed near-optimal timeliness and verification effectiveness among the several examined zero-knowledge proof schemes. These findings validate the proposed framework as an efficient, scalable, and performance-enhanced blockchain solution for securing industrial ecosystems with latency sensitivity in a 6G-enabled environment.

TI A hybrid deep learning approach to solve optimal power flow problem in
   hybrid renewable energy systems
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB The reliable operation of power systems while integrating renewable energy systems depends on Optimal Power Flow (OPF). Power systems meet the operational demands by efficiently managing the OPF. Identifying the optimal solution for the OPF problem is essential to ensure voltage stability, and minimize power loss and fuel cost when the power system is integrated with renewable energy resources. The traditional procedure to find the optimal solution utilizes nature-inspired metaheuristic optimization algorithms which exhibit performance drop in terms of high convergence rate and local optimal solution while handling uncertainties and nonlinearities in Hybrid Renewable Energy Systems (HRES). Thus, a novel hybrid model is presented in this research work using Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) with Quantum Inspired Genetic Algorithm (DRL-QIGA). The DRL in the proposed model effectively combines the proximal policy network to optimize power generation in real-time. The ability to learn and adapt to the changes in a real-time environment makes DRL to be suitable for the proposed model. Meanwhile, the QIGA enhances the global search process through the quantum computing principle, and this improves the exploitation and exploration features while searching for optimal solutions for the OPF problem. The proposed model experimental evaluation utilizes a modified IEEE 30-bus system to validate the performance. Comparative analysis demonstrates the proposed model's better performance in terms of reduced fuel cost of $620.45, minimized power loss of 1.85 MW, and voltage deviation of 0.065 compared with traditional optimization algorithms.

TI Modification of Diamond Surface by Femtosecond Laser Pulses
SO PHOTONICS
AB The basic mechanisms of laser interaction with synthetic diamond are reviewed. The characteristics of the main regimes of diamond surface etching are considered. In addition to the well-known graphitization and ablation processes, nanoablation and accumulative graphitization, which have attracted relatively recent attention, are described in detail. The focus is on femtosecond (fs) laser exposure, which allows for the formation of a dense cold electron-hole plasma in the focal zone and minimal overheating in the surrounding area. This potentially opens the way to the development of unique laser-based technologies that combine physical and chemical processes for precise surface treatment and functionalization. The physical limitations that determine how precisely the diamond surface can be treated by short-pulsed laser radiation and possible ways to overcome them with the ultimate goal of removing ultrathin layers of the material are discussed. Special attention is paid to the novel possibility of inducing the local formation of point active defects-nitrogen vacancy (NV) complexes in the laser-irradiated zone. Such defects have been at the forefront of solid-state physics for the past thirty years due to continuous attempts to exploit their unique properties in quantum optics, quantum computing, magnetometry, probing, and other fields. Both regimes of NV center formation with and without graphitization of the diamond lattice are considered. Thus, it is shown that intense pulsed laser irradiation is a perfect tool for the processing of synthetic diamonds at the micro-, nano-, and even at the atomic level, which can be well controlled and managed.

TI Finite Block Length Analysis on Quantum Coherence Distillation and
   Incoherent Randomness Extraction
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INFORMATION THEORY
AB We give the first systematic study on the second order asymptotics of the operational task of coherence distillation with and without assistance. In the unassisted setting, we introduce a variant of randomness extraction framework where free incoherent operations are allowed before the incoherent measurement and the randomness extractors. We then show that the maximum number of random bits extractable from a given quantum state is precisely equal to the maximum number of coherent bits distillable from the same state. This relation enables us to derive tight second order expansions of both tasks in the independent and identically distributed setting. Remarkably, the incoherent operation classes that can empower coherence distillation for generic states all admit the same second order expansions, indicating their operational equivalence for coherence distillation in both asymptotic and large block length regimes. We then generalize the above line of research to the assisted setting, arising naturally in bipartite quantum systems where Bob distills coherence from the state at hand, aided by the benevolent Alice possessing the other system. More precisely, we introduce a new assisted incoherent randomness extraction task and establish an exact relation between this task and the assisted coherence distillation. It strengthens the one-shot relation in the unassisted setting and confirms that this cryptographic framework offers a new perspective to the study of quantum coherence distillation. Likewise, this relation yields second order characterizations to the assisted tasks. As by-products, we show the strong converse property of the tasks above from their second order expansions.

TI A Survey on Beyond 5G Network With the Advent of 6G: Architecture and
   Emerging Technologies
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB Nowadays, 5G is in its initial phase of commercialization. The 5G network will revolutionize the existing wireless network with its enhanced capabilities and novel features. 5G New Radio (5G NR), referred to as the global standardization of 5G, is presently under the 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) and can be operable over the wide range of frequency bands from less than 6GHz to mmWave (100GHz). 3GPP mainly focuses on the three major use cases of 5G NR that are comprised of Ultra-Reliable and Low Latency Communication (uRLLC), Massive Machine Type Communication (mMTC), Enhanced Mobile Broadband (eMBB). For meeting the targets of 5G NR, multiple features like scalable numerology, flexible spectrum, forward compatibility, and ultra-lean design are added as compared to the LTE systems. This paper presents a brief overview of the added features and key performance indicators of 5G NR. The issues related to the adaptation of higher modulation schemes and inter-RAT handover synchronization are well addressed in this paper. With the consideration of these challenges, a next-generation wireless communication architecture is proposed. The architecture acts as the platform for migration towards beyond 5G/6G networks. Along with this, various technologies and applications of 6G networks are also overviewed in this paper. 6G network will incorporate Artificial intelligence (AI) based services, edge computing, quantum computing, optical wireless communication, hybrid access, and tactile services. For enabling these diverse services, a virtualized network slicing based architecture of 6G is proposed. Various ongoing projects on 6G and its technologies are also listed in this paper.

TI Timing measurements with silicon single photon avalanche diodes:
   principles and perspectives [Invited]
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB Picosecond timing of single photons has laid the foundation of a great variety of applications, from life sciences to quantum communication, thanks to the combination of ultimate sensitivity with a bandwidth that cannot be reached by analog recording techniques. Nowadays, more and more applications could still be enabled or advanced by progress in the available instrumentation, resulting in a steadily increasing research interest in this field. In this scenario, single-photon avalanche diodes (SPADs) have gained a key position, thanks to the remarkable precision they are able to provide, along with other key advantages like ruggedness, compactness, large signal amplitude, and room temperature operation, which neatly distinguish them from other solutions like superconducting nanowire single-photon detectors and silicon photomultipliers. With this work, we aim at filling a gap in the literature by providing a thorough discussion of the main design rules and tradeoffs for silicon SPADs and the electronics employed along them to achieve high timing precision.

TI Electromagnetic Approach to Cavity Spintronics
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW APPLIED
AB The fields of cavity quantum electrodynamics and magnetism have recently merged into cavity spintronics, investigating a quasiparticle that emerges from the strong coupling between standing electromagnetic waves confined in a microwave cavity resonator and the quanta of spin waves, magnons. This phenomenon is now expected to be employed in a variety of devices for applications ranging from quantum communication to dark matter detection. To be successful, most of these applications require a vast control of the coupling strength, resulting in intensive efforts to understanding coupling by a variety of different approaches. Here, the electromagnetic properties of both resonator and magnetic samples are investigated to provide a comprehensive understanding of the coupling between these two systems. Because the coupling is a consequence of the excitation vector fields, which directly interact with magnetization dynamics, a highly accurate electromagnetic perturbation theory is employed that predicts the resonant hybrid mode frequencies for any field configuration within the cavity resonator. The coupling is shown to be strongly dependent not only on the excitation vector fields and sample?s magnetic properties but also on the sample?s shape. These findings are illustrated by applying the theoretical framework to two distinct experiments: a magnetic sphere placed in a three-dimensional resonator and a rectangular, magnetic prism placed in a two-dimensional resonator. The theory provides comprehensive understanding of the overall behavior of strongly coupled systems and it can be easily modified for a variety of other systems.

TI Analyzing and Unifying Robustness Measures for Excitation Transfer
   Control in Spin Networks
SO IEEE CONTROL SYSTEMS LETTERS
AB Recent achievements in quantum control have resulted in advanced techniques for designing controllers for applications in quantum communication, computing, and sensing. However, the susceptibility of such systems to noise and uncertainties necessitates robust controllers that perform effectively under these conditions to realize the full potential of quantum devices. The time-domain log-sensitivity and a recently introduced robustness infidelity measure (RIM) are two means to quantify controller robustness in quantum systems. The former can be found analytically, while the latter requires Monte-Carlo sampling. In this letter, the correlation between the log-sensitivity and the RIM for evaluating the robustness of single excitation transfer fidelity in spin chains and rings in the presence of dephasing is investigated. We show that the expected differential sensitivity of the error agrees with the differential sensitivity of the RIM, where the expectation is over the error probability distribution. Statistical analysis also demonstrates that the log-sensitivity and the RIM are linked via the differential sensitivity, and that the differential sensitivity and RIM are highly concordant. This unification of two means (one analytic and one via sampling) to assess controller robustness in a variety of realistic scenarios provides a first step in unifying various tools to model and assess robustness of quantum controllers.

TI Coherence of quantum non-Gaussian states via nonlinear absorption of
   quanta
SO QUANTUM SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB The linear and phase insensitive absorption of a single quanta via coherent interactions with a saturable system, even a single ground state qubit, is sufficient to deterministically generate quantum non-Gaussian states in an oscillator, even stimulated merely by increasing thermal oscillator energy. However, the resultant states only approach Fock states and therefore do not exhibit quantum coherence. Here we overcome this limitation using a minimal step: a nonlinear phase-insensitive absorption process added to the linear one. The coherent addition of such individually passive processes allows coherence to emerge and increase in phase space without an external drive and with minimal interaction requirements. The coherence of quantum non-Gaussian states emerges because the linear and nonlinear absorption processes are not mutually passive. In the simplest case rotationally symmetric Wigner functions of the oscillator Fock states convert their many negative regions to an extremely complex asymmetric structure in sharp contrast to the rotational symmetry of those obtained by the individual interactions. We extend this case to include an unsaturable absorber (oscillator) and analyse switching between linear and nonlinear absorptions, suitable for broad classes of experiments.

TI A C-band cryogenic gallium arsenide low-noise amplifier for quantum
   applications
SO CHIP
AB Large-scale superconducting quantum computers require massive numbers of high-performance cryogenic low-noise amplifiers (cryo-LNAs) for qubit readout. Here we presented a C-band monolithic microwave integrated circuit (MMIC) cryo-LNA for this purpose. This cryo-LNA is based on a 150 nm gallium arsenide (GaAs) pseudomorphic high electron mobility transistor (pHEMT) process and implemented with a three-stage cascaded architecture, where the first stage adopts careful impedance matching to optimize the noise and return loss. The integration of negative feedback loops adopted in the second and third stages enhances the overall stability. Moreover, the pHEMT self-bias and current multiplexing circuitry structure facilitate the reduction of power consumption and require only a single bias line. Operating at an ambient temperature of 3.6 K and consuming 15 mW, the cryoLNA demonstrates good performance in the C-band, reaching a minimum noise temperature of 4 K and an average gain of 40 dB. We further benchmarked this cryo-LNA with superconducting qubits, achieving an average single-shot dispersive readout fidelity of 98.3% without assistance from a quantum-limited parametric amplifier. The development of GaAs cryo-LNA diversifies technical support necessary for large-scale quantum applications

TI End-to-end protocol for high-quality quantum approximate optimization
   algorithm parameters with few shots
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB The quantum approximate optimization algorithm (QAOA) is a quantum heuristic for combinatorial optimization that has been demonstrated to scale better than state-of-the-art classical solvers for some problems. For a given problem instance, QAOA performance depends crucially on the choice of the parameters. While average-case optimal parameters are available in many cases, meaningful performance gains can be obtained by fine-tuning these parameters for a given instance. This task is especially challenging, however, when the number of circuit executions (shots) is limited. In this work, we develop an end-to-end protocol that combines multiple parameter settings and fine-tuning techniques. We use large-scale numerical experiments to optimize the protocol for the shot-limited setting and observe that optimizers with the simplest internal model (linear) perform best. We implement the optimized pipeline on a trapped-ion processor using up to 32 qubits and 5 QAOA layers, and we demonstrate that the pipeline is robust to small amounts of hardware noise. To the best of our knowledge, these are the largest demonstrations of QAOA parameter fine-tuning on a trapped-ion processor in terms of two-qubit gate count.

TI Detecting gravitational waves via coherence degradation induced by the
   Unruh effect
SO EUROPEAN PHYSICAL JOURNAL C
AB We investigate the effects of a gravitational wave background on the coherence degradation induced by the Unruh effect of a uniformly accelerated single-qubit and quantum interferometric circuit. In both systems, we use the formalism of the evolution of the density matrix of the detector-field system, where after the interaction the field degrees of freedom are traced out to obtain the reduced density matrix of the detector. In this background, we calculate the quantum coherence and interferometric visibility in the long-wavelength regime and large interaction time. Our results indicate that the gravitational wave transfers energy to the internal states of the detector, causing, together with the Unruh effect, changes in them, amplifying the coherence degradation of the system. This amplification occurs when the polarization modes of the gravitational wave are in resonance and have modulated amplitudes. For the case of a short-wavelength, the detector does not respond to the gravitational wave because its oscillation is so fast that the detector does not have time to respond within the system timescale. Therefore, it is possible to detect the signature of gravitational waves in the coherence degradation induced by the Unruh effect within the regimes studied here.

TI NbN-based half-flux-quantum element for integration with superconducting
   qubits
SO APPLIED PHYSICS LETTERS
AB Half-flux-quantum (HFQ) logic is a superconductor logic family comprising conventional Josephson junctions (0-JJs) and pi Josephson junctions (pi-JJs). The energy scale of HFQ logic can be flexibly reduced by phase shifts owing to pi-JJs; thus, HFQ circuits are a promising building block for qubit interface circuits. In this study, we demonstrate an NbN-based HFQ circuit element compatible with NbN-based superconducting qubits for all-NbN monolithic integration of qubits and HFQ circuits. The use of NbN is beneficial for both qubits and HFQ circuits owing to its high-quality junctions and high kinetic inductance. First, we developed a prototype of an NbN-based 0-JJ/pi-JJ hybrid fabrication process for designing HFQ circuits. We evaluated 0-JJs and pi-JJs fabricated through the hybrid process, which demonstrated that the 0-JJs had a small deviation with regard to critical current density and the pi-JJs had a sufficiently high critical current density to work as pi phase shifters. Furthermore, we fabricated an HFQ superconducting quantum interference device, which is one of the most fundamental elements in HFQ circuits, and observed clear HFQ-period modulation in the magnetic flux dependence of the maximum current at 4.2 K.

TI Control of Ge island coalescence for the formation of nanowires on
   silicon
SO NANOSCALE HORIZONS
AB Germanium nanowires could be the building blocks of hole-spin qubit quantum computers. Selective area epitaxy enables the direct integration of Ge nanowires on a silicon chip while controlling the device design, density, and scalability. For this to become a reality, it is essential to understand and control the initial stages of the epitaxy process. In this work, we highlight the importance of surface treatment in the reactor prior to growth to achieve high crystal quality and connected Ge nanowire structures. In particular, we demonstrate that exposure to AsH3 during the high-temperature treatment enhances lateral growth of initial Ge islands and promotes faster formation of continuous Ge nanowires in trenches. The Kolmogorov-Johnson-Mehl-Avrami crystallization model supports our explanation of Ge coalescence. These results provide critical insight into the selective epitaxy of horizontal Ge nanowires on lattice-mismatched Si substrates, which can be translated to other material systems.

TI Intersystem crossing and exciton-defect coupling of spin defects in
   hexagonal boron nitride
SO NPJ COMPUTATIONAL MATERIALS
AB Despite the recognition of two-dimensional (2D) systems as emerging and scalable host materials of single-photon emitters or spin qubits, the uncontrolled, and undetermined chemical nature of these quantum defects has been a roadblock to further development. Leveraging the design of extrinsic defects can circumvent these persistent issues and provide an ultimate solution. Here, we established a complete theoretical framework to accurately and systematically design quantum defects in wide-bandgap 2D systems. With this approach, essential static and dynamical properties are equally considered for spin qubit discovery. In particular, many-body interactions such as defect-exciton couplings are vital for describing excited state properties of defects in ultrathin 2D systems. Meanwhile, nonradiative processes such as phonon-assisted decay and intersystem crossing rates require careful evaluation, which competes together with radiative processes. From a thorough screening of defects based on first-principles calculations, we identify promising single-photon emitters such as Si-VV and spin qubits such as Ti-VV and Mo-VV in hexagonal boron nitride. This work provided a complete first-principles theoretical framework for defect design in 2D materials.

TI Redox conditions correlated with vibronic coupling modulate quantum
   beats in photosynthetic pigment-protein complexes
SO PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF
   AMERICA
AB Quantum coherences, observed as time-dependent beats in ultrafast spectroscopic experiments, arise when light-matter interactions prepare systems in superpositions of states with differing energy and fixed phase across the ensemble. Such coherences have been observed in photosynthetic systems following ultrafast laser excitation, but what these coherences imply about the underlying energy transfer dynamics remains subject to debate. Recent work showed that redox conditions tune vibronic coupling in the Fenna-Matthews-Olson (FMO) pigment-protein complex in green sulfur bacteria, raising the question of whether redox conditions may also affect the long-lived (>100 fs) quantum coherences observed in this complex. In this work, we perform ultrafast twodimensional electronic spectroscopy measurements on the FMO complex under both oxidizing and reducing conditions. We observe that many excited-state coherences are exclusively present in reducing conditions and are absent or attenuated in oxidizing conditions. Reducing conditions mimic the natural conditions of the complex more closely. Further, the presence of these coherences correlates with the vibronic coupling that produces faster, more efficient energy transfer through the complex under reducing conditions. The growth of coherences across the waiting time and the number of beating frequencies across hundreds of wavenumbers in the power spectra suggest that the beats are excitedstate coherences with a mostly vibrational character whose phase relationship is maintained through the energy transfer process. Our results suggest that excitonic energy transfer proceeds through a coherent mechanism in this complex and that the coherences may provide a tool to disentangle coherent relaxation from energy transfer driven by stochastic environmental fluctuations.

TI Modeling and Evaluating Superconducting Ferroelectric SQUID Circuits
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON QUANTUM ENGINEERING
AB Ferroelectric superconducting quantum interference device (Fe-SQUID) has recently emerged as a viable option to realize superconducting computing due to its voltage-controlled switching, which is essential to build large-scale digital circuits. This is the first work to model Fe-SQUID-based logic circuits and develop standard cell libraries compatible with existing electronic design automation (EDA) tool flows. We provide a comprehensive evaluation of the power consumption and performance of a wide range of Fe-SQUID-based arithmetic circuits, benchmarking them against the state-of-the-art 5 nm fin field-effect transistor (FinFET)-based circuits. Our 5 nm FinFET transistor model is validated against industrial measurements. The validation is conducted not only at room temperature but also at extremely low temperatures, down to 10 K, for fair comparisons against Fe-SQUID superconducting circuits. Our findings revealed that contrary to CMOS-based circuits, circuits realized using Fe-SQUID dissipate significantly more power. This presents a substantial challenge within the constraints of limited cooling power budgets in state-of-the-art cryostats.

TI Magnetoresistive-coupled transistor using the Weyl semimetal NbP
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Semiconductor transistors operate by modulating the charge carrier concentration of a channel material through an electric field coupled by a capacitor. This mechanism is constrained by the fundamental transport physics and material properties of such devices-attenuation of the electric field, and limited mobility and charge carrier density in semiconductor channels. In this work, we demonstrate a new type of transistor that operates through a different mechanism. The channel material is a Weyl semimetal, NbP, whose resistivity is modulated via a magnetic field generated by an integrated superconductor. Due to the exceptionally large electron mobility of this material, which reaches over 1,000,000 cm2/Vs, and the strong magnetoresistive coupling, the transistor can generate significant transconductance amplification at nanowatt levels of power. This type of device can enable new low-power amplifiers, suitable for qubit readout operation in quantum computers.
   L. Rocchino et al. experimentally demonstrate a magnetic field effect transistor based on the Weyl semimetal NbP as the active channel material. A gate magnetic field is generated by current flowing in an integrated superconductor NbN. The device operation relies on the extreme magnetoresistance of the NbP.

TI Sample-efficient model-based reinforcement learning for quantum control
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB We propose a model-based reinforcement learning (RL) approach for noisy time-dependent gate optimization with reduced sample complexity over model-free RL. Sample complexity is defined as the number of controller interactions with the physical system. Leveraging an inductive bias, inspired by recent advances in neural ordinary differential equations (ODEs), we use an autodifferentiable ODE, parametrized by a learnable Hamiltonian ansatz, to represent the model approximating the environment, whose time-dependent part, including the control, is fully known. Control alongside Hamiltonian learning of continuous time-independent parameters is addressed through interactions with the system. We demonstrate an order of magnitude advantage in sample complexity of our method over standard model-free RL in preparing some standard unitary gates with closed and open system dynamics, in realistic computational experiments incorporating single-shot measurements, arbitrary Hilbert space truncations, and uncertainty in Hamiltonian parameters. Also, the learned Hamiltonian can be leveraged by existing control methods like GRAPE (gradient ascent pulse engineering) for further gradient-based optimization with the controllers found by RL as initializations. Our algorithm, which we apply to nitrogen vacancy (NV) centers and transmons, is well suited for controlling partially characterized one- and two-qubit systems.

TI Nature and Origin of Operators Entering the Master Equation of an Open
   Quantum System
SO OPEN SYSTEMS & INFORMATION DYNAMICS
AB By exploiting the peculiarities of a recently introduced formalism for describing open quantum systems (the parametric representation with environmental coherent states) we derive an equation of motion for the reduced density operator of an open quantum system that has the same structure of the celebrated Gorini-Kossakowski-Sudarshan-Lindblad equation, but holds regardless of Markovianity being assumed. The operators in our result have explicit expressions in terms of the Hamiltonian describing the interactions with the environment, and can be computed once a specific model is considered. We find that, instead of a single set of Lindblad operators, in the general (non-Markovian) case there one set of Lindblad-like operators for each and every point of a symplectic manifold associated to the environment. This intricacy disappears under some assumptions (which are related to Markovianity and the classical limit of the environment), under which it is possible to recover the usual master-equation formalism. Finally, we find such Lindblad-like operators for two different models of a qubit in a bosonic environment, and show that in the classical limit of the environment their renown master equations are recovered.

TI Single-molecule mid-infrared spectroscopy and detection through
   vibrationally assisted luminescence
SO NATURE PHOTONICS
AB Room-temperature detection of molecular vibrations in the mid-infrared (MIR, lambda = 3-30 mu m) has numerous applications, including real-time gas sensing, medical imaging and quantum communication. However, existing technologies rely on cooled semiconductor detectors because of thermal noise limitations. One way to overcome this challenge is to upconvert the low-energy MIR photons into high-energy visible wavelengths (lambda = 500-800 nm) where detection of single photons is easily achieved using silicon technologies. This process suffers from weak cross-sections and the MIR-to-visible wavelength mismatch, limiting its efficiency. Here we exploit molecular emitters possessing both MIR and visible transitions from molecular vibrations and electronic states, coupled through Franck-Condon factors. By assembling molecules into a plasmonic nanocavity resonant at both MIR and visible wavelengths, and optically pumping them below the electronic absorption band, we show transduction of MIR light. The upconverted signal is observed as enhanced visible luminescence. Combining Purcell-enhanced visible luminescence with enhanced rates of vibrational pumping gives transduction efficiencies of >10%. MIR frequency-dependent upconversion gives the vibrational signatures of molecules assembled in the nanocavity. Transient picocavity formation further confines MIR light down to the single-molecule level. This allows us to demonstrate single-molecule MIR detection and spectroscopy that is inaccessible to any previous detector.

TI Electrically Tunable and Modulated Perovskite Quantum Emitters via
   Surface-Enhanced Landau Damping
SO ADVANCED MATERIALS
AB Tuning quantum emission to a specific wavelength at room temperature holds significant promise for enhancing secure quantum communication, particularly by aligning with the Fraunhofer lines in the solar spectrum. The integration of quantum emitters with phase-change materials enables emission wavelength modulation, especially when strong field enhancement is present. Antimony telluride (Sb2Te3) exhibits the potential to facilitate this functionality through its support of interband plasmonics and phase-change behavior. In this study, Sb2Te3 antennae are designed and fabricated to tune the emission energy of adjacent perovskite quantum dots (QDs) by over 570 meV. The underlying mechanism involves the localized surface plasmons (LSPs) on Sb2Te3 nanostructures, which exhibit a surface-enhanced Landau damping process that facilitates the decay of LSPs into electron-hole pairs. The generated hot electrons are then injected into perovskite QDs via the microscopic electron transport process, which can be triggered by the transition of Sb2Te3 from amorphous to a crystalline state, resulting in a significant emission energy shift from 1.64 to 2.21 eV. Furthermore, the emission energy of perovskite QDs on crystalline Sb2Te3 nanoantennae can be modulated through DC voltage bias, highlighting the potential for extensive wavelength tunability of quantum emitters integrated with electronic systems.

TI Analytical frequency-doubled HG modes in astigmatic mode converters for
   composite vortex beam generation
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB We present a powerful analytical framework that fully characterizes the propagation and astigmatic mode conversion (AMC) of frequency-doubled Her mite-Gaussian (HG) modes, enabling the deterministic generation of composite vortex beams (CVBs). Our approach is based on a rigorous modal decomposition, in which any frequency-doubled HG mode is expanded as a linear superposition of HG basis modes with analytically derived, fixed coefficients. The propagation of a frequency-doubled HG mode is described as the linear superposition of its constituent HG modes, each accumulating a distinct Gouy phase while maintaining its modal coefficient. Fundamentally, AMC acts as a unitary transformation, mapping the complete HG basis onto the full Laguer re-Gaussian (LG) basis in Hilbert space. This framework naturally expresses the resulting CVB as a linear superposition of LG modes, each inheriting the coefficient of its corresponding HG mode. The validity of our model is rigorously confirmed by excellent agreement between theoretical analysis, numerical simulations, and experimental measurements, which accurately reproduce the transverse intensity and phase profiles. This work establishes a groundbreaking paradigm for on-demand generation and control of complex structured light, offering significant advancements for optical manipulation, quantum communication, and high-dimensional information processing.

TI Superoxide- and semiquinone-linked activation of molecular hydrogen in
   metal-catalyst-free solution
SO FRONTIERS IN MOLECULAR BIOSCIENCES
AB The therapeutic effects of molecular hydrogen (H2), particularly in ischemia-reperfusion (I/R) injury and deleterious inflammation, have been increasingly attributed to its modulation of redox balance. However, the precise molecular mechanisms underlying H2-medated redox modulation, particularly in mitochondrial reverse electron transfer (RET)-driven superoxide (O2 center dot-) generation, remain unclear. Here we show that under membrane-less in-solution conditions, H2 modulates O2 center dot- kinetics in ways consistent with a tunneling-assisted electron transfer involving SQ radicals, without catalytic metals or hydrogenases. Using enzymatic (xanthine oxidase/hypoxanthine; XO/Hx) and non-enzymatic (potassium superoxide; KO2) systems combined with the O2 center dot--specific chemiluminescent probe, 2-methyl-6-p-methoxyethynyl-imidazopyrazinone (MPEC), we observed bell-shaped and U-shaped O2 center dot- kinetics as a function of H2. In Q-free assays, O2 center dot- appeared to activate H2, yielding a clear bell-shaped kinetic profile compatible with tunneling-assisted electron transfer from H2 to O2 center dot-. When Q was present, distinct U-shaped profiles emerged, consistent with Q center dot--mediated electron buffering followed by H2 activation. Electron spin resonance (ESR) radical scavenging experiments and quantitative high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) analyses confirmed transient semiquinone-mediated redox cycling leading to the formation of ubiquinol (QH2). Collectively, these in-solution data support a metal-free pathway for H2 participation in Q redox cycling that is compatible with tunneling-assisted electron transfer under defined in vitro conditions. These findings demonstrate the chemical feasibility of H2-driven Q reduction in-solution; the in vivo relevance remains to be determined.

TI Integrating frontiers: a holistic, quantum and evolutionary approach to
   conquering cancer through systems biology and multidisciplinary synergy
SO FRONTIERS IN ONCOLOGY
AB Cancer therapy is facing increasingly significant challenges, marked by a wide range of techniques and research efforts centered around somatic mutations, precision oncology, and the vast amount of big data. Despite this abundance of information, the quest to cure cancer often seems more elusive, with the "war on cancer" yet to deliver a definitive victory. A particularly pressing issue is the development of tumor treatment resistance, highlighting the urgent need for innovative approaches. Evolutionary, Quantum Biology and System Biology offer a promising framework for advancing experimental cancer research. By integrating theoretical studies, translational methods, and flexible multidisciplinary clinical research, there's potential to enhance current treatment strategies and improve outcomes for cancer patients. Establishing stronger links between evolutionary, quantum, entropy and chaos principles and oncology could lead to more effective treatments that leverage an understanding of the tumor's evolutionary dynamics, paving the way for novel methods to control and mitigate cancer. Achieving these objectives necessitates a commitment to multidisciplinary and interprofessional collaboration at the heart of both research and clinical endeavors in oncology. This entails dismantling silos between disciplines, encouraging open communication and data sharing, and integrating diverse viewpoints and expertise from the outset of research projects. Being receptive to new scientific discoveries and responsive to how patients react to treatments is also crucial. Such strategies are key to keeping the field of oncology at the forefront of effective cancer management, ensuring patients receive the most personalized and effective care. Ultimately, this approach aims to push the boundaries of cancer understanding, treating it as a manageable chronic condition, aiming to extend life expectancy and enhance patient quality of life.

TI A mathematical modeling of the mitochondrial proton leak via quantum
   tunneling
SO AIMS BIOPHYSICS
AB The mitochondrion is a vital intracellular organelle that is responsible for ATP production. It utilizes both the concentration gradient and the electrical potential of the inner mitochondrial membrane to drive the flow of protons from the intermembrane space to the matrix to generate ATP via ATP-synthase. However, the proton leak flow, which is mediated via the inner mitochondrial membrane and uncoupling proteins, can reduce the efficiency of ATP production. Protons can exhibit a quantum behavior within biological systems. However, the investigation of the quantum behavior of protons within the mitochondria is lacking particularly in the contribution to the proton leak. In the present study, we proposed a mathematical model of protons tunneling through the inner mitochondrial membrane and the mitochondrial carrier superfamily MCF including uncoupling proteins UCPs and the adenine nucleotide translocases ANTs. According to the model and its assumptions, the quantum tunneling of protons may contribute significantly to the proton leak if it is compared with the classical flow of protons. The quantum tunneling proton leak may depolarize the membrane potential, hence it may contribute to the physiological regulation of ATP synthesis and reactive oxygen species ROS production. In addition to that, the mathematical model of proton tunneling suggested that the protontunneling leak may depolarize the membrane potential to values beyond the physiological needs which in turn can harm the mitochondria and the cells. Moreover, we argued that the quantum proton leak might be more energetically favorable if it is compared with the classical proton leak. This may give the advantage for quantum tunneling of protons to occur since less energy is required to contribute significantly to the proton leak compared with the classical proton flow.

TI Quantum Tunneling-Induced Membrane Depolarization Can Explain the
   Cellular Effects Mediated by Lithium: Mathematical Modeling and
   Hypothesis
SO MEMBRANES
AB Lithium imposes several cellular effects allegedly through multiple physiological mechanisms. Membrane depolarization is a potential unifying concept of these mechanisms. Multiple inherent imperfections of classical electrophysiology limit its ability to fully explain the depolarizing effect of lithium ions; these include incapacity to explain the high resting permeability of lithium ions, the degree of depolarization with extracellular lithium concentration, depolarization at low therapeutic concentration, or the differences between the two lithium isotopes Li-6 and Li-7 in terms of depolarization. In this study, we implemented a mathematical model that explains the quantum tunneling of lithium ions through the closed gates of voltage-gated sodium channels as a conclusive approach that decodes the depolarizing action of lithium. Additionally, we compared our model to the classical model available and reported the differences. Our results showed that lithium can achieve high quantum membrane conductance at the resting state, which leads to significant depolarization. The quantum model infers that quantum membrane conductance of lithium ions emerges from quantum tunneling of lithium through the closed gates of sodium channels. It also differentiates between the two lithium isotopes (Li-6 and Li-7) in terms of depolarization compared with the previous classical model. Moreover, our study listed many examples of the cellular effects of lithium and membrane depolarization to show similarity and consistency with model predictions. In conclusion, the study suggests that lithium mediates its multiple cellular effects through membrane depolarization, and this can be comprehensively explained by the quantum tunneling model of lithium ions.

TI The collapse of the wave function as the mediator of free will in prime
   neurons
SO FRONTIERS IN NEUROSCIENCE
AB In our current view of reality, free will hangs on two opposing forces. On one side, we have determinism, which states that everything is already determined by our inner constituents, the atoms and molecules that form our bodies. On the other side, we have quantum mechanics and its view that everything in the quantum world is inherently random and probabilistic. None of these perspectives gives rise to the phenomenon of what we call free will, but here in this article, we provide an underlying mechanism for how free will should operate in our world. We propose that the collapse of the wave function is responsible for determining our free will in prime neurons. The collapse of the wave function is the process by which a particle passes from a state of superposition or being in several places at the same time to a definitive state with clearly established properties. Prime neurons are a class of neurons that are responsible for initiating a thought process or an action in our brains. But for this to operate, the collapse of the wave function must not act on regular matter, for that would yield a purely random result. We need a new and hypothetical particle, for which we have placed the term "soul/spirit particle." This soul/spirit particle has very specific features, as we have discussed in this article, and we have provided a mathematical model to explain its interaction with our inner physiology.

TI Isotope effects on radical pair performance in cryptochrome: A new
   hypothesis for the evolution of animal migration
SO BIOESSAYS
AB Mechanisms occurring at the atomic level are now known to drive processes essential for life, as revealed by quantum effects on biochemical reactions. Some macroscopic characteristics of organisms may thus show an atomic imprint, which may be transferred across organisms and affect their evolution. This possibility is considered here for the first time, with the aim of elucidating the appearance of an animal innovation with an unclear evolutionary origin: migratory behaviour. This trait may be mediated by a radical pair (RP) mechanism in the retinal flavoprotein cryptochrome, providing essential magnetic orientation for migration. Isotopes may affect the performance of quantum processes through their nuclear spin. Here, we consider a simple model and then apply the standard open quantum system approach to the spin dynamics of cryptochrome RP. We changed the spin quantum number (I) and g-factor of hydrogen and nitrogen isotopes to investigate their effect on RP's yield and magnetic sensitivity. Strong differences arose between isotopes with I = 1 and I = 1/2 in their contribution to cryptochrome magnetic sensitivity, particularly regarding Earth's magnetic field strengths (25-65 mu T). In most cases, isotopic substitution improved RP's magnetic sensitivity. Migratory behaviour may thus have been favoured in animals with certain isotopic compositions of cryptochrome.
   Mineral stable isotope fractionation makes likely that animals of the same species have common isotopic profiles. Isotopes affect the performance of quantum processes driving biochemical reactions. Certain profiles may thus promote the evolutionary origin of traits such as migratory ability, residing on a radical pair mechanism in the pigment cryptochrome.image

TI Mathematical Modeling of Ion Quantum Tunneling Reveals Novel Properties
   of Voltage-Gated Channels and Quantum Aspects of Their Pathophysiology
   in Excitability-Related Disorders
SO PATHOPHYSIOLOGY
AB Voltage-gated channels are crucial in action potential initiation and propagation and there are many diseases and disorders related to them. Additionally, the classical mechanics are the main mechanics used to describe the function of the voltage-gated channels and their related abnormalities. However, the quantum mechanics should be considered to unravel new aspects in the voltage-gated channels and resolve the problems and challenges that classical mechanics cannot solve. In the present study, the aim is to mathematically show that quantum mechanics can exhibit a powerful tendency to unveil novel electrical features in voltage-gated channels and be used as a promising tool to solve the problems and challenges in the pathophysiology of excitability-related diseases. The model of quantum tunneling of ions through the intracellular hydrophobic gate is used to evaluate the influence of membrane potential and gating free energy on the tunneling probability, single channel conductance, and quantum membrane conductance. This evaluation is mainly based on graphing the mathematical relationships between these variables. The obtained mathematical graphs showed that ions can achieve significant quantum membrane conductance, which can affect the resting membrane potential and the excitability of cells. In the present work, quantum mechanics reveals original electrical properties associated with voltage-gated channels and introduces new insights and implications into the pathophysiology of excitability- related disorders. In addition, the present work sets a mathematical and theoretical framework that can be utilized to conduct experimental studies in order to explore the quantum aspects of voltage-gated channels and the quantum bioelectrical property of biological membranes.

TI A simple Monte Carlo model for performance optimization of single photon
   avalanche diode
SO PHYSICA SCRIPTA
AB Single photon avalanche diode (SPAD) has the advantage of high internal gain, which is widely used in fluorescence detection and quantum communication. The high internal gain of the device is mainly due to avalanche multiplier effect. Therefore, it is of great significance to study avalanche multiplication effect for the design and performance optimization of SPAD devices. In this paper, a Simple Monte Carlo (SMC) model is implemented based on MATLAB, which includes interval phonon scattering and impact ionization of carriers. In this model, the electric field at different reverse bias voltages is extracted based on Technology-Computer- Aided- Design (TCAD). The model simulates the energy, velocity and impact ionization of carriers in the depletion region. The model has been verified on SPAD devices fabricated by 0.18um Bipolar - Complementary Metal Oxide Semiconductor - Diffused Metal Oxide Semiconductor (BCD) process. The SMC model simulates the dependence of the avalanche multiplication gain and excess noise factor of the SPAD device on the reverse bias voltage. In addition, the SMC model estimates the current-voltage (IV) characteristics and avalanche breakdown voltage of the device. In conclusion, the SMC model can provide guidance for the design and performance optimization of SPAD devices.

TI Harnessing data augmentation to quantify uncertainty in the early
   estimation of single-photon source quality
SO MACHINE LEARNING-SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB Novel methods for rapidly estimating single-photon source (SPS) quality have been promoted in recent literature to address the expensive and time-consuming nature of experimental validation via intensity interferometry. However, the frequent lack of uncertainty discussions and reproducible details raises concerns about their reliability. This study investigates the use of data augmentation, a machine learning technique, to supplement experimental data with bootstrapped samples and quantify the uncertainty of such estimates. Eight datasets obtained from measurements involving a single InGaAs/GaAs epitaxial quantum dot serve as a proof-of-principle example. Analysis of one of the SPS quality metrics derived from efficient histogram fitting of the synthetic samples, i.e. the probability of multi-photon emission events, reveals significant uncertainty contributed by stochastic variability in the Poisson processes that describe detection rates. Ignoring this source of error risks severe overconfidence in both early quality estimates and claims for state-of-the-art SPS devices. Additionally, this study finds that standard least-squares fitting is comparable to using a Poisson likelihood, and expanding averages show some promise for early estimation. Also, reducing background counts improves fitting accuracy but does not address the Poisson-process variability. Ultimately, data augmentation demonstrates its value in supplementing physical experiments; its benefit here is to emphasise the need for a cautious assessment of SPS quality.

TI Multi-Domain Modeling of Free-Running Harmonic Frequency Comb Formation
   in Terahertz Quantum Cascade Lasers
SO IEEE PHOTONICS JOURNAL
AB Optical frequency comb (OFC) emission in quantum cascade lasers (QCLs) is highly attractive for applications in metrology and sensing. Recently, coherent OFC mode-locking with large intermodal spacing was demonstrated in QCLs. These self-starting harmonic frequency combs (HFCs) show highly phase-stable operation and promise interesting perspectives towards optical or even quantum communication. Here, we present a detailed multi-domain modeling approach for the numerical study of QCLs. Our theoretical characterization is divided into stationary carrier transport simulations, based on the ensemble Monte Carlo method, and dynamical simulations of the light-matter interaction, based on multi-level Maxwell-density matrix equations. We investigate the influence of the chosen eigenstate basis on the gain spectrum and present self-consistent simulation results of stable HFC operation in a double metal terahertz QCL. In our simulations, the studied QCL gain medium shows self-starting harmonic mode-locking for different bias and waveguide configurations, resulting in a mode spacing of up to twelve times the cavity round trip frequency. Furthermore, we characterize the spectral time evolution of the coherent HFC formation process, yielding the spontaneous build-up of a dense multimode state which is gradually transferred into a broad and clear harmonic OFC state.

TI Shack-Hartmann Wavefront Sensing of Ultrashort Optical Vortices
SO SENSORS
AB Light beams carrying Orbital Angular Momentum (OAM), also known as optical vortices (OV), have led to fascinating new developments in fields ranging from quantum communication to novel light-matter interaction aspects. Even though several techniques have emerged to synthesize these structured-beams, their detection, in particular, single-shot amplitude, wavefront, and modal content characterization, remains a challenging task. Here, we report the single-shot amplitude, wavefront, and modal content characterization of ultrashort OV using a Shack-Hartmann wavefront sensor. These vortex beams are obtained using spiral phase plates (SPPs) that are frequently used for high-intensity applications. The reconstructed wavefronts display a helical structure compatible with the topological charge induced by the SPPs. We affirm the accuracy of the optical field reconstruction by the wavefront sensor through an excellent agreement between the numerically backpropagated and experimentally obtained intensity distribution at the waist. Consequently, through Laguerre-Gauss (LG) decomposition of the reconstructed fields, we reveal the radial and azimuthal mode composition of vortex beams under different conditions. The potential of our method is further illustrated by characterizing asymmetric Gaussian vortices carrying fractional average OAM, and a realtime topological charge measurement at a 10Hz repetition rate. These results can promote Shack-Hartmann wavefront sensing as a single-shot OV characterization tool.

TI GA-Synthesized Training Framework for Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy PID Control
   in High-Precision SPAD Thermal Management
SO MACHINES
AB This study presents a hybrid adaptive control strategy that integrates genetic algorithm (GA) optimization with an adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) for precise thermal regulation of single-photon avalanche diodes (SPADs). To address the nonlinear and disturbance-sensitive dynamics of SPAD systems, a performance-oriented dataset is constructed through multi-scenario simulations using settling time, overshoot, and steady-state error as fitness metrics. The genetic algorithm (GA) facilitates broad exploration of the proportional-integral-derivative (PID) controller parameter space while ensuring control stability by discarding low-performing gain combinations. The resulting high-quality dataset is used to train the ANFIS model, enabling real-time, adaptive tuning of PID gains. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed GA-ANFIS-PID controller significantly enhances dynamic response, robustness, and adaptability over both the conventional Ziegler-Nichols PID and GA-only PID schemes. The controller maintains stability under structural perturbations and abrupt thermal disturbances without the need for offline retuning, owing to the real-time inference capabilities of the ANFIS model. By combining global evolutionary optimization with intelligent online adaptation, this approach improves both accuracy and generalization, offering a practical and scalable solution for SPAD thermal management in demanding environments such as quantum communication, sensing, and single-photon detection platforms.

TI Evaluating the Effectiveness of Sodium Hypochlorite for Genomic DNA
   Decontamination
SO ENVIRONMENTAL DNA
AB Environmental DNA (eDNA) is an increasingly popular, sensitive, and cost-efficient method for studying biodiversity and detecting species. This noninvasive approach involves collecting environmental samples that contain genetic material shed by organisms into their surroundings. Due to the method's sensitivity, robust decontamination strategies are crucial, with sodium hypochlorite, commonly known as bleach, frequently employed. Despite its widespread use, there is no consensus on the most effective bleach concentration, leading to inconsistencies in how the chemical is used in research. This study aimed to determine the minimum concentration of bleach needed for effective decontamination. Genomic DNA of signal crayfish was treated with various concentrations of bleach, ranging from 0.01% to 5% (w/w). Results were observed using Qubit High Sensitivity reagents, quantitative PCR, agarose gel electrophoresis, and the Agilent TapeStation. Our results indicate that a minimum concentration of 0.5% (w/w) bleach is sufficient to prevent the detection of genomic DNA by the techniques tested. These results provide important insights into the use of bleach for decontamination in eDNA research. Establishing a standard bleach concentration for decontamination protocols will help to reduce inconsistencies and enhance the reliability of eDNA studies.

TI Experimental snapshot verification of non-Markovianity by quantum
   probing of convex coefficients
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB We apply the recently proposed quantum probing protocols with an unknown system-probe coupling to probe the convex coefficients in mixtures of commuting states. By using two reference states instead of one as originally suggested, we are able to probe both the lower and upper bounds for the convex coefficient. We perform extensive analysis for the roles of the parameters characterizing the double peaked Gaussian frequency spectrum in the Markovian-to-non-Markovian transition of the polarization dynamics of a single photon. We apply the probing of the convex coefficient to the transition-inducing frequency parameter and show that the non-Markovianity of the polarization dynamics can be confirmed with a single snapshot measurement of the polarization qubit performed at unknown time. Furthermore, we change the "known" measurement coupling that corresponds to our dynamics of interest to unknown measurement coupling and show that even for unknown measurement couplings the probing method is precise enough to confirm that using the "known coupling" would lead to non-Markovian polarization dynamics. We also show how the protocol can identify Markovian and non-Markovian time intervals in the dynamics. The results are validated with single-photon experiments.

TI Tunneling Current Through a Double Quantum Dots System
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB Electrostatically confined quantum dots in semiconductors hold the promise to achieve high scalability and reliability levels for practical implementation of solid-state qubits where the electrochemical potentials of each quantum dot can be independently controlled by the gate voltages.In this paper, the current and charge stability diagram of two-well potentials arising from electrostatically defined double quantum dot (DQD) are analytically realized. We propose to apply the Generalized Hubbard model to find the Hamiltonian of the system. The proposed analysis takes the tunnel coupling between the dots, Coulomb interaction, and Zeeman energy arising from an external magnetic field into account. Using quantum master equations to predict the probability of the final states in a DQD system, we study the tunneling current through two quantum dots coupled in series with two conducting leads, and therefore, the charge stability diagram is theoretically investigated. The impact of the tunnel coupling and Zeeman energy on the charge stability diagram is deeply discussed. The validity of the presented analysis is confirmed by experimental data as well as the classical capacitance model.

TI Active Tunable Pulse Shaping Using MoS2-Assisted
   All-Dielectric Metasurface
SO ADVANCED PHOTONICS RESEARCH
AB While optical pulse shapers have important applications in classical and quantum communication regimes and laser resonant cavities, engineering of group delay dispersion (GDD) remains one of their greatest challenges. Herein, by taking advantage of the electrically tunable optical properties of 2D material and the low-loss nature of dielectric material. This paper demonstrates how an active tunable all-dielectric metasurface assisted by 2D material can be leveraged to shape the temporal profile of a pulse. The proposed metasurface consists of an array of nanobars covered by a 2D sheet and positioned on a distributed Bragg reflector (DBR) as a perfect mirror to design a phase-only modulator. Upon introducing in-plane asymmetries, the quasi-bound state in the continuum (QBIC) resonance emerges under normal incidence, which subsequently leads to achieving both significant GDD and the two regimes of pulse stretching and compressing via boosting the effect of the permittivity variation of molybdenum disulfide (MoS2). The monolayer MoS2 proves to be an excellent substitute for other tunable materials with inherent dissipative loss in the visible frequency range. Following such an active tunable geometrically fixed configuration, various pulse-shaping operations are achieved, including compression (peak intensity up to 350%), expansion (peak intensity from 60%), splitting, and higher-order distortion.

TI Enantio-sensitive unidirectional light bending
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Structured light, which exhibits nontrivial intensity, phase, and polarization patterns in space, has key applications ranging from imaging and 3D micromanipulation to classical and quantum communication. However, to date, its application to molecular chirality has been limited by the weakness of magnetic interactions. Here we structure light's local handedness in space to introduce and realize an enantio-sensitive interferometer for efficient chiral recognition without magnetic interactions, which can be seen as an enantio-sensitive version of Young's double slit experiment. Upon interaction with isotropic chiral media, such chirality-structured light effectively creates chiral emitters of opposite handedness, located at different positions in space. We show that if the distribution of light's handedness breaks left-right symmetry, the interference of these chiral emitters leads to unidirectional bending of the emitted light, in opposite directions in media of opposite handedness, even if the number of the left-handed and right-handed emitters excited in the medium is exactly the same. Our work introduces the concepts of polarization of chirality and chirality-polarized light, exposes the immense potential of sculpting light's local chirality, and offers novel opportunities for efficient chiral discrimination, enantio-sensitive optical molecular fingerprinting and imaging on ultrafast time scales. Developing new methods for structuring light's chirality in space would be advantageous for various next-generation applications. Here, the authors report enantio-sensitive unidirectional light bending by interacting light with isotropic chiral media.

TI Study of Type II SPDC in Lithium Niobate for High Spectral Purity Photon
   Pair Generation
SO CRYSTALS
AB Recent advances of high-quality lithium niobate (LN) on insulator technology have revitalized the progress of novel chip-integrated LN-based photonic devices and accelerated application research. One of the promising technologies of interest is the generation of entangled photon pairs based on spontaneous parametric down-conversion (SPDC) in LNs. In this paper, we investigated, theoretically and numerically, Type II SPDC in two kinds of LNs-undoped and 5-mol% MgO doped LNs. In each case, both non-poled and periodically poled crystals were considered. The technique is based on the SPDC under Type II extended phase matching, where the phase matching and the group velocity matching are simultaneously achieved between interacting photons. The proposed approach has not yet been reported for LNs. We discussed all factors required to generate photon pairs in LNs, in terms of the beam propagation direction, the spectral position of photons, and the corresponding effective nonlinearities and walk-offs. We showed that the spectral positions of the generated photon pairs fall into the mid-infrared region with high potential for free-space quantum communication, spectroscopy, and high-sensitivity metrology. The joint spectral analyses showed that photon pairs can be generated with high purities of 0.995-0.999 with proper pump filtering.

TI Room Temperature Single Photon Detection at 1550 nm Using van der Waals
   Heterojunction
SO ADVANCED FUNCTIONAL MATERIALS
AB Single-photon detectors (SPDs) are crucial in applications ranging from space, biological imaging to quantum communication and information processing. The SPDs that operate at room temperature are of particular interest to broader application space as the energy overhead introduced by cryogenic cooling can be avoided. Although silicon-based single photon avalanche diodes (SPADs) are well-matured and operate at room temperature, the bandgap limitation restricts their operation at telecommunication wavelength (1550 nm) and beyond. InGaAs-based SPADs, on the other hand, are sensitive to 1550 nm photons but suffer from relatively lower efficiency, high dark count rate, afterpulsing probability, and pose hazards to the environment from the fabrication process. In this work, the properties of nanomaterials that can be leveraged to address these challenges are demonstrated and a room-temperature single-photon detector capable of operating at 1550 nm is realized. This is achieved by coupling a low bandgap (approximate to 350 meV) absorber (black phosphorus) to a sensitive van der Waals probe that is capable of detecting discrete electron fluctuation. The device is optimized for operation at 1550 nm and demonstrates an overall quantum efficiency of 21.4% (estimated as 42.8% for polarized light), and a minimum dark count of approximate to 720 Hz at room temperature.

TI Unbounded quantum advantage in communication complexity measured by
   distinguishability
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Communication complexity is a fundamental aspect of information science, concerned with the amount of communication required to solve a problem distributed among multiple parties. The standard quantification of one-way communication complexity relies on the minimal dimension of the communicated systems. In this paper, we measure the communication complexity of a task by the minimal distinguishability required to accomplish it, while leaving the dimension of the communicated systems unconstrained. Distinguishability is defined as the maximum probability of correctly guessing the sender's input from the message, quantifying the message's distinctiveness relative to the sender's input. This measure becomes especially relevant when maintaining the confidentiality of the sender's input is essential. After establishing the generic framework, we focus on three relevant families of communication complexity tasks-the random access codes, equality problems defined by graphs, and the pair-distinguishability tasks. We derive general lower bounds on the minimal classical distinguishability as a function of the success metric of these tasks. We demonstrate that quantum communication outperforms classical communication presenting explicit protocols and utilizing semidefinite programming methods. In particular, we demonstrate unbounded quantum advantage for random access codes and Hadamard graph-based equality problems. Specifically, we show that the classical-to-quantum ratio of minimal distinguishability required to achieve the same success metric escalates polynomially and exponentially with the complexity of these tasks, reaching arbitrarily large values.

TI Xenon-plasma focused ion beam processing of photonic microstructures
   with GaAs-based quantum dots
SO OPTICAL MATERIALS EXPRESS
AB So far, successful focused ion beam (FIB) based fabrication of photonic structures with quantum dots (QDs) has been limited to cases with above 1 mu m thick cap, usually in a form of a distributed Bragg reflector of a vertical cavity, which simultaneously protects the active region from the destructive influence of the ion beam. Here, we propose optimized xenon-plasma FIB (Xe-PFIB) technology as a fast and cost-efficient solution alternative to the commonly used combination of electron beam lithography and etching. We demonstrate a 3D processing of GaAs-based photonic microstructures with InGaAs QDs emitting close to the telecom O-band for cylindrical mesas with different cap thicknesses (50-650 nm) obtained by using two approaches: (i) Xe-PFIB for both reducing the cap thickness as well as the in-plane microstructure size, and (ii) wet chemical etching for cap layer removal and subsequent Xe-PFIB for the in-plane milling. The latter appeared more efficient when judging by photoluminescence intensity. Utilizing an additional protecting layer of platinum or carbon was also tested. Eventually, we for the first time show successful FIB-based fabrication of photonic microstructures with bright emission from single QDs capped with only 200 nm layer, which indicates the prospects of this technology for processing of efficient QD-based single-photon sources for quantum communication.

TI Unbounded randomness from uncharacterized sources
SO COMMUNICATIONS PHYSICS
AB Randomness is a central feature of quantum mechanics and an invaluable resource for both classical and quantum technologies. Commonly, in Device-Independent and Semi-Device-Independent scenarios, randomness is certified using projective measurements, and its amount is bounded by the quantum system's dimension. Here, we propose a Source-Device-Independent protocol, based on Positive Operator Valued Measurement (POVM), which can arbitrarily increase the number of certified bits for any fixed dimension. Additionally, the proposed protocol doesn't require an initial seed and active basis switching, simplifying its experimental implementation and increasing the generation rates. A tight lower-bound on the quantum conditional min-entropy is derived using only the POVM structure and the experimental expectation values, taking into account the quantum side-information. For symmetric POVM on the Bloch sphere, we derive closed-form analytical bounds. Finally, we experimentally demonstrate our method with a compact and simple photonic setup that employs polarization-encoded qubits and POVM up to 6 outcomes.
   The laws of quantum mechanics allow for the generation of genuine random numbers, but quantum random number generation schemes need additional assumptions on the sources and detection to ensure the security and their generation is limited by the system's dimension. The authors propose and experimentally demonstrate a quantum random number generation scheme based on positive operator valued measurements, lifting the requirement of a trusted source which can arbitrarily increase the number of certified bits for any dimension.

TI Control of Plexcitonic Strong Coupling via Substrate-Mediated Hotspot
   Nanoengineering
SO ADVANCED OPTICAL MATERIALS
AB Plexcitonic strong coupling has ushered in an era of room-temperature quantum electrodynamics at the nanoscale. Realizing its potential applications from single-molecule spectroscopy to room-temperature quantum technologies on an industrial level requires scalable and mass-producible plasmonic cavities that provide ease of access and control for quantum emitters. Here, a strategy for multidimensional hotspot engineering is proposed via a rational selection of substrates, which facilitates elevation of a gold bowtie nanocavity hotspot to the top of the device and provides a field enhancement of approximate to 482 (a 1.6-fold increase compared to a conventional bowtie-on-glass cavity at the bottom of the nanogap). The formation mechanism for these antenna modes is discussed from the perspective of charge carrier motion; and their advantages, particularly in view of their dominantly in-plane polarized near-fields, are further elaborated in a spatiotemporal study of plexcitonic strong coupling, which reveals ultrafast quantum dynamics and potential for applications related to 2D materials whose excitonic dipoles are typically oriented in-plane. The conceptual discovery of this substrate-enabled hotspot nanoengineering could readily be extended to tailor hotspots in other plasmonic platforms, and may inspire a plethora of novel research directions from plasmon-enhanced spectroscopy and sensing to the design of quantum logic gates and quantum metasurfaces.

TI A four-field quantum model of life, subjectivity, consciousness, and
   memory: integrating dual-brain psychology and biophoton quantum
   interactions
SO MEDICAL HYPOTHESES
AB Contemporary theories of life, consciousness, and memory rely on untestable theories that do not address the physical mechanisms behind the dramatic state changes that they attempt to explain, such as the change from matter (brain) to mind. Here, we propose a testable, novel, Four-Field Quantum Model comprising fundamental Life, Subjective, Awareness, and Memory Fields. These fields interact with biological systems through coherent emissions, serving as the mechanistic interface coupling coherence patterns (quantum, classical electromagnetic, and biophotonic) to the fields. I suggest that the observed qualitative state changes are due to symmetry-breaking transformations such as, by analogy, the effects of the Higgs fields' transformation of a massless particle to one with mass, or the photoelectric effect where a photon is essentially transformed into an electron, via its electric field. Mechanistically, the Life Field promotes biochemical processes to living states; the Subjective Field transforms structured neural information into non-conscious experiential agential content, ultimately non-conscious hemispheric selves; the Awareness Field converts these non-conscious states into conscious self experiences; and the Memory Field encodes and retrieves episodic and generational developmental memories. We suggest that structured hemispheric brain information interacts with the proposed quantum subjective field, involving symmetry-breaking processes that qualitatively transform the initial informational states into subjective states. Clinical evidence from unilateral transcranial photobiomodulation, informed by Dual-Brain Psychology, supports these proposed mechanisms, demonstrating therapeutic efficacy. This model remains speculative pending proposed experimental validation of the coherence effects. The mechanistic framework does provide testable predictions suitable for interdisciplinary research into life, consciousness, memory, and psychology.

TI Preparation and research progress of GaN-based avalanche photodetectors
SO MICROSTRUCTURES
AB The demand for single-photon high-sensitivity ultraviolet (UV) detection is continuously increasing in cutting-edge fields such as UV astronomy, environmental monitoring, and space communications. In particular, gallium nitride (GaN) is an ideal material for UV detection due to its wide bandgap (3.4 eV), strong radiation immunity, and visible/solar-blind properties. In this respect, avalanche photodetectors (APDs) are very promising candidates for single-photon UV detection due to their high sensitivity, large gain, high detection efficiency, and room temperature operation. This review summarizes the GaN avalanche breakdown characteristics, including current surge, positive temperature coefficient of Vbr, and non-linear characterization. In addition, recent advances in various structural types of GaN APDs, such as p-i-n, separated absorption multiplication, optimized edge termination, and polarization-enhanced structures, are presented. In addition, the directions and challenges for the future development of GaN APDs are discussed. Although GaN-based APDs have significantly improved their UV single-photon detection performance through structural innovations, noise control, linearity optimization, and process simplification remain the core challenges. In the future, the integration with two-dimensional material heterojunction and new light trapping structure is expected to break through the existing bottleneck and promote its application in frontier fields such as deep space exploration and quantum communication.

TI Investigation of Extracted Plasma Cell-Free DNA as a Biomarker in Foals
   with Sepsis
SO VETERINARY SCIENCES
AB Simple Summary Cell-free DNA (cfDNA) are pieces of DNA released from cells into body fluids. Previous studies in adult horses found that plasma cfDNA concentrations differed significantly between healthy horses and those with emergencies like colic. These studies also showed that accurate measurement of plasma cfDNA in adult horses required extraction, due to matrix effects of equine plasma. It's unclear if similar issues exist in foal plasma. In our study, we aimed to determine if foal plasma has similar interference, and if there are differences in cfDNA levels between healthy, sick non-septic (SNS), and septic foals. Cell-free DNA was measured directly in plasma and after extracting it using a kit in 60 foals. Direct measurement of cfDNA in foal plasma was found to be inaccurate due to matrix effect. However, even after cfDNA extraction, there were no significant differences in plasma cfDNA levels or the ratio of cfDNA to neutrophils between healthy foals, SNS foals, and septic foals. Future research should focus on understanding how neutrophils function during foal sepsis.Abstract Cell-free DNA (cfDNA) is fragmented extracellular DNA that is released from cells into various body fluids. Previously published data from adult horses supports cfDNA as a potential disease biomarker, but also shows that direct measurement in plasma is inaccurate due to matrix effect. It is currently unknown whether a similar matrix effect exists in foal plasma. Given this, the objectives of the current study were to investigate foal plasma for potential matrix effect during fluorescence measurement of cfDNA using a Qubit fluorometer, and to determine whether neat and/or extracted plasma cfDNA concentrations are significantly different in healthy, sick non-septic (SNS) or septic foals. We hypothesized that matrix effect would interfere with accurate fluorescent measurement of cfDNA in foal plasma. Further, we hypothesized that mean extracted cfDNA concentrations, and/or extracted cfDNA:neutrophil ratio, would be elevated in plasma of septic foals compared to healthy or SNS foals. Cell-free DNA was measured in neat plasma, and following DNA extraction with a commercial kit, from 60 foals. Foal plasma exhibited both autofluorescence and non-specific dye binding, confirming matrix effect. However, even with extraction, no significant difference was found in cfDNA concentrations, or cfDNA:neutrophil ratios, between healthy (sepsis score <= 5), SNS (sepsis score 6-11 and negative blood culture), or septic (sepsis score >= 12 +/- positive blood culture) foals. Our data show that matrix effect interferes with accurate Qubit measurement of cfDNA in foal plasma and supports previous findings that plasma cfDNA concentrations are not associated with sepsis diagnosis in foals. Further research is needed to better understand neutrophil function and dysfunction in foal sepsis.

TI Quantum mechanical aspects of cardiac arrhythmias: A mathematical model
   and pathophysiological implications
SO AIMS BIOPHYSICS
AB Cardiac arrhythmias are serious myocardial electrical disturbances that affect the rate and rhythm of heartbeats. Despite the rapidly accumulating data about the pathophysiology and the treatment, new insights are required to improve the overall clinical outcome of patients with cardiac arrhythmias. Three major arrhythmogenic processes can contribute to the pathogenesis of cardiac arrhythmias; 1) enhanced automaticity, 2) afterdepolarization-triggered activity and 3) reentry circuits. The mathematical model of the quantum tunneling of ions is used to investigate these mechanisms from a quantum mechanical perspective. The mathematical model focuses on applying the principle of quantum tunneling to sodium and potassium ions. This implies that these ions have a non-zero probability of passing through the gate, which has an energy that is higher than the kinetic energy of ions. Our mathematical findings indicate that, under pathological conditions, which affect ion channels, the quantum tunneling of sodium and potassium ions is augmented. This augmentation creates a state of hyperexcitability that can explain the enhanced automaticity, after depolarizations that are associated with triggered activity and a reentry circuit. Our mathematical findings stipulate that the augmented and thermally assisted quantum tunneling of sodium and potassium ions can depolarize the membrane potential and trigger spontaneous action potentials, which may explain the automaticity and afterdepolarization. Furthermore, the quantum tunneling of potassium ions during an action potential can provide a new insight regarding the formation of a reentry circuit. Introducing these quantum mechanical aspects may improve our understanding of the pathophysiological mechanisms of cardiac arrhythmias and, thus, contribute to finding more effective anti-arrhythmic drugs.

   matter systems
SO RESPONSIVE MATERIALS
AB Circularly polarized luminescent (CPL) materials have received significant attention in the field of fundamental science recently. These materials offer substantial advancement of technological applications, such as optical data storage, displays, and quantum communication. Various strategies have been proposed in self-assembled materials consisting of inorganic, organic, and hybrid systems, particularly in the chiral orientationally ordered soft matter systems (e.g., chiral liquid crystals (LCs) and LC polymers). However, developing scientific approaches to achieve the pronounced and steerable circularly polarized light emission remains challenging. Herein, we present a comprehensive review on the recent development of CPL materials based on chiral LCs, including thermotropic LCs (cholesteric LCs and bent-core LCs), lyotropic LCs (nanocellulose LCs and polyacetylene-based LCs), and LC polymers (cholesteric LC-based polymers, helical nanofibers, and helical network). In addition, the fundamental mechanisms, design principles, and potential applications based on these chiral LCs and LC polymers in soft matter systems are systematically reviewed. This review summarizes with a prospect on the latent challenges, which can strengthen our understanding of the basic principles of CPL in chiral orientationally ordered soft matter systems and provide a new insight into the progress in several fields, such as chemistry, materials science, optics, electronics, and biology.

TI Enhancing Accuracy of Quantum-Selected Configuration Interaction
   Calculations Using Multireference Perturbation Theory: Application to
   Aromatic Molecules
SO ACS OMEGA
AB Quantum-selected configuration interaction (QSCI) is a novel quantum-classical hybrid algorithm for quantum chemistry calculations. This method identifies electron configurations having large weights for the target state using quantum devices and allows CI calculations to be performed with the selected configurations on classical computers. In principle, the QSCI algorithm can take advantage of the ability to handle large configuration spaces while reducing the negative effects of noise on the calculated values. At present, QSCI calculations are limited by qubit noise during the input state preparation and measurement processes, restricting them to small active spaces. These limitations make it difficult to perform calculations with quantitative accuracy. The present study demonstrates a computational scheme based on multireference perturbation theory calculations on a classical computer, using the QSCI wave function as a reference. This method was applied to ground and excited state calculations for two typical aromatic molecules, naphthalene and tetracene. The incorporation of the perturbation treatment was found to provide improved accuracy. Extension of the reference space based on the QSCI-selected configurations as a means of further improvement was also investigated.

TI Irreversibility beyond Landauer's principle: is it possible to perform
   erasure using the quantum homogenizer?
SO NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB Erasure is fundamental for information processing. It is also key in connecting information theory and thermodynamics, as it is a logically irreversible task. We provide a new angle on this connection, noting that there may be an additional cost to erasure, that is not captured by standard results such as Landauer's principle. To make this point we use a model of irreversibility based on constructor theory-a recently proposed generalization of the quantum theory of computation. The model uses a machine called the 'quantum homogenizer', which has the ability to approximately realise the transformation of a qubit from any state to any other state and remain approximately unchanged, through overall entirely unitary interactions. We argue that when performing erasure via quantum homogenization there is an additional cost to performing the erasure step of the Szilard's engine, because it is more difficult to reliably produce pure states in a cycle than to produce maximally mixed states. We also discuss the implications of this result for the cost of erasure in more general terms.

TI Limitations of tensor-network approaches for optimization and sampling:
   A comparison to quantum and classical Ising machines
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW APPLIED
AB Optimization problems pose challenges across various fields. In recent years, quantum annealers have emerged as a promising platform for tackling such challenges. Here, to provide an additional perspective, we develop a heuristic tensor-network-based algorithm to reveal the low-energy spectra of Ising spin-glass systems with interaction graphs relevant to present-day quantum annealers. Our deterministic approach combines a branch-and-bound search strategy with an approximate calculation of marginals via tensor-network contractions. Its application to quasi-two-dimensional lattices with large unit cells of up to 24 spins, realized in current quantum annealing processors, requires a dedicated approach that uses sparse structures in the tensor-network representation and GPU hardware acceleration. We benchmark our approach on random problems defined on Pegasus and Zephyr graphs with up to a few thousand spins, comparing it against the D-Wave Advantage quantum annealer and the simulated bifurcation algorithm, with the latter representing an emerging class of classical Ising solvers. In addition to examining the quality of the best solutions, we compare the diversity of low-energy states sampled by all the solvers. For the largest considered independent and identically distributed problems with over 5000 spins, the state-of-theart tensor-network approaches lead to solutions that are 0.1% to 1% worse than the best solutions obtained by Ising machines while being 2 orders of magnitude slower. We attribute these results to approximate contraction failures. For embedded tile planting instances, our approach reaches approximately 0.1% from the planted ground state, a factor of 3 better than the Ising solvers. While all three methods can output diverse low-energy solutions-e.g., differing by at least a quarter of spins with energy error below 1%-our deterministic branch-and-bound approach finds sets of a few such states at most. In contrast, both Ising machines prove capable of sampling sets of thousands of such solutions.

TI The π-π architectures reveal a hidden quantum code linking aromaticity
   to light interaction
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB Bioinformatics models illustrate interactions among aromatic rings. Aromatic molecules and groups exist in multiple systems, ranging from biological substances to materials. However, the nature of these non-covalent interactions remains a matter of controversy and uncertainty. This study presents a theoretical approach to uncover the code behind pi-pi non-covalent interactions using benzene dimers as a prototype. Orbital and electrostatic interactions influence the solid-state conformation of these complexes. Electron delocalization occurs from the donor benzene into the empty lobe of the pz orbital of one carbon atom in the acceptor benzene. The associated charge transfer accounts for the interaction energy between the dimers, functioning like a highly entangled qubit. Additionally, from a quantum-mechanical perspective, the response to an optical radiation field is regarded as an interaction that causes the field to mix the energy levels of the electronic system. Here, we present our analysis of the parallel alignment of aromatic coupling and light-pi interactions based on our model of electron pairs in oscillatory resonant quantum states.

TI Emergent ferromagnetism with superconductivity in Fe(Te,Se) van der
   Waals Josephson junctions
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Ferromagnetism and superconductivity are two key ingredients for topological superconductors, which can serve as building blocks of fault-tolerant quantum computers. Adversely, ferromagnetism and superconductivity are typically also two hostile orderings competing to align spins in different configurations, and thus making the material design and experimental implementation extremely challenging. A single material platform with concurrent ferromagnetism and superconductivity is actively pursued. In this paper, we fabricate van der Waals Josephson junctions made with iron-based superconductor Fe(Te,Se), and report the global device-level transport signatures of interfacial ferromagnetism emerging with superconducting states for the first time. Magnetic hysteresis in the junction resistance is observed only below the superconducting critical temperature, suggesting an inherent correlation between ferromagnetic and superconducting order parameters. The 0-pi phase mixing in the Fraunhofer patterns pinpoints the ferromagnetism on the junction interface. More importantly, a stochastic field-free superconducting diode effect was observed in Josephson junction devices, with a significant diode efficiency up to 10%, which unambiguously confirms the spontaneous time-reversal symmetry breaking. Our work demonstrates a new way to search for topological superconductivity in iron-based superconductors for future high T-c fault-tolerant qubit implementations from a device perspective.

TI Photoswitchable quantum electrodynamics in a hybrid plasmonic quantum
   emitter
SO CHIP
AB The design and preparation of quantum states free from environmental decohering effects is critically important for the development of on-chip quantum systems with robustness. One promising strategy is to harness quantum state superposition to construct decoherencefree subspace (DFS), which is termed dark state. Typically, the excitation of dark states relies on anti-phase-matching on two qubits and the inter-qubit distance is of wavelength scale, which limits the development of compact quantum chips. In the current work, a hybrid plasmonic quantum emitter was proposed, which was composed of strongly correlated quantum emitters intermediated by a plasmonic nanocavity. Through turning the plasmonic loss from drawback into advantage, the anti-phase-matching rule was broken by rapidly decaying the superposed bright state and preparing a sub-100 nm dark state with decay rate reduced by 3 orders of magnitudes. More interestingly, the dark state could be optically switched to a single-photon emitter with enhanced brightness through photon-blockade, with the quantum second order correlation function at zero delay showing a wide range of tunability down to 0.02.

TI Miniaturized magnetic-field sensor based on nitrogen-vacancy centers
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW APPLIED
AB The nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center in diamond is a prime candidate for quantum sensing technologies. Here, we present a fully integrated and mechanically robust fiber-based endoscopic sensor with a tip diameter of 1.25 mm. On its tip, a direct laser-writing process is used to secure a diamond containing NV centers above the fiber's core inside a polymer structure. Additionally, a metallic direct laser-written antenna structure next to the fiber facet allows efficient microwave manipulation of NV-center spins. The sensor achieves a shot-noise-limited magnetic-field sensitivity of 5.9 nT/i/Hz using a 15-mu m-sized micro-diamond at a microwave power of 50 mW and an optical power of 2.15 mW. Using lock-in techniques, we measure a sensitivity of 51.8 nT/i/Hz. Furthermore, we introduce a dual-fiber concept that enables, in combination with a direct laser-written structure, independent guiding of excitation and fluorescence light and thus reduces background autofluorescence. Moreover, controlled guiding of excitation light to the diamond while avoiding sample illumination may enable operation in light-sensitive environments such as biological tissue. While the demonstrated sensitivity is achieved using a single-fiber configuration, the dual-fiber approach provides a path toward integrating smaller diamonds, where autofluorescence would otherwise limit performance. We demonstrate the capability of vector magnetic-field measurements in the type of magnetic field used in state-of-the-art ultracold quantum gas experiments, opening a potential arena in which high resolution and high sensitivity are required.

TI Poor Man's Majorana Tetron
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB The Majorana tetron is a prototypical topological qubit stemming from the ground-state degeneracy of a superconducting island hosting four Majorana modes. This degeneracy manifests as an effective non-local spin degree of freedom, the most paradigmatic signature of which is the topological Kondo effect. Degeneracies of states with different fermionic parities also characterize minimal Kitaev chains, which have lately emerged as a platform to realize and study unprotected versions of Majorana modes, dubbed poor man's Majorana modes. Here, we introduce the "poor man's Majorana tetron," comprising four quantum dots coupled via a floating superconducting island. Its charging energy yields nontrivial correlations among the dots, although, unlike a standard tetron, it is not directly determined by the fermionic parity of the Majorana modes. The poor man's tetron displays parameter regions with a twofold-degenerate ground state with odd fermionic parity, which gives rise to an effective Anderson impurity model when coupled to external leads. We show that this system can approach a regime featuring the topological Kondo effect under a suitable tuning of experimental parameters. Therefore, the poor man's tetron is a promising device to observe the nonlocality of Majorana modes and their related fractional conductance.

TI Mean field analysis of reverse annealing for code-division
   multiple-access multiuser detection
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Code-division multiple-access (CDMA) multiuser detection is a kind of signal recovery problem. The main problem of CDMA multiuser detection is to estimate the original signal from the degraded information. In CDMA multiuser detection, the first-order phase transition happens. The first-order phase transition degrades the estimation performance. To avoid or mitigate the first-order phase transition, we apply adiabatic reverse annealing (ARA) to CDMA multiuser detection. In ARA, we introduce the initial Hamiltonian, which corresponds to the prior information of the original signal into quantum annealing (QA) formulation. The ground state of the initial Hamiltonian is the initial candidate solution. By using the prior information of the original signal, ARA enhances the performance of QA for CDMA multiuser detection. We evaluate the typical ARA performance of CDMA multiuser detection by means of statistical mechanics using the replica method. At first, we consider the oracle cases where the initial candidate solution is randomly generated with a fixed fraction of the original signal in the initial state. In the oracle cases, the first-order phase transition can be avoided or mitigated by ARA if we prepare for the proper initial candidate solution. We validate our theoretical analysis with quantum Monte Carlo simulations. The theoretical results to avoid the first-order phase transition are consistent with the numerical results. Next, we consider the practical cases where we prepare for the initial candidate solution obtained by commonly used algorithms. We show that the practical algorithms can exceed the threshold to avoid the first-order phase transition. Finally, we test the performance of ARA with the initial candidate solution obtained by the practical algorithm. In this case, ARA cannot avoid the first-order phase transition even if the initial candidate solution exceeds the threshold to avoid the first-order phase transition.

TI Many-fermion simulation from the contracted quantum eigensolver without
   fermionic encoding of the wave function
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Quantum computers potentially have an exponential advantage over classical computers for the quantum simulation of many-fermion quantum systems. Nonetheless, fermions are more expensive to simulate than bosons due to the fermionic encoding???a mapping by which the qubits are encoded with fermion statistics. Here we generalize the contracted quantum eigensolver (CQE) to avoid fermionic encoding of the wave function. In contrast to the variational quantum eigensolver, the CQE solves for a many-fermion stationary state by minimizing the contraction (projection) of the Schr??dinger equation onto two fermions. We avoid fermionic encoding of the wave function by contracting the Schr??dinger equation onto an unencoded pair of particles. Solution of the resulting contracted equation by a series of unencoded two-body exponential transformations generates an unencoded wave function from which the energy and two-fermion reduced density matrix (2-RDM) can be computed. We apply the unencoded and the encoded CQE algorithms to the hydrogen fluoride molecule, the dissociation of oxygen O2, and a series of hydrogen chains. Both algorithms show comparable convergence towards the exact ground-state energies and 2-RDMs, but the unencoded algorithm has computational advantages in terms of state preparation and tomography.

TI Automated graph-based detection of quantum control schemes: Application
   to molecular laser cooling
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB One of the demanding frontiers in ultracold quantum science is identifying laser cooling schemes for complex atoms and molecules out of their vast spectra of internal states. Motivated by the prospect of expanding the set of available ultracold molecules for applications in fundamental physics, chemistry, astrochemistry, and quantum simulation, we propose and demonstrate an automated graph-based search approach for viable laser cooling schemes. The method is time efficient, reproduces the results of previous manual searches, and reveals a plethora of new potential laser cooling schemes. We discover laser cooling schemes for YO, C2, OH+, CN, and CO2, including surprising schemes that start from highly excited states or do not rely on a strong main transition. A central insight of this work is that the reinterpretation of quantum states and transitions between them as a graph can dramatically enhance the ability to identify new quantum control schemes for complex quantum systems. As such, this approach will also apply to complex atoms and, in fact, any complex many-body quantum system with a discrete spectrum of internal states.

TI Terahertz linear/non-linear anomalous Hall conductivity of moire TMD
   hetero-nanoribbons as topological valleytronics materials
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB Twisted moire van der Waals heterostructures hold promise to provide a robust quantum simulation platform for strongly correlated materials and realize elusive states of matter such as topological states in the laboratory. We demonstrated that the moire bands of twisted transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD) hetero-nanoribbons exhibit non-trivial topological order due to the tendency of valence and conduction band states in K valleys to form giant band gaps when spin-orbit coupling (SOC) is taken into account. Among the features of twisted WS2/MoS2 and WSe2/MoSe2, we found that the heavy fermions associated with the topological flat bands and the presence of strongly correlated states, enhance anomalous Hall conductivity (AHC) away from the magic angle. By band analysis, we showed that the topmost conduction bands from the +/- K-valleys are perfectly flat and carry a spin/valley Chern number. Moreover, we showed that the non-linear anomalous Hall effect in moire TMD hetero-nanoribbons can be used to manipulate terahertz (THz) radiation. Our findings establish twisted heterostructures of group-VI TMD nanoribbons as a tunable platform for engineering topological valley quantum phases and THz non-linear Hall conductivity.

TI Accuracy of quantum simulators with ultracold dipolar molecules: A
   quantitative comparison between continuum and lattice descriptions
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB With rapid progress in control and manipulation of ultracold magnetic atoms and dipolar molecules, the quan-tum simulation of lattice models with strongly interacting dipole-dipole interactions (DDIs) and high densities is now within experimental reach. This rapid development raises the issue about the validity of quantum simulation in such regimes. In this study, we address this question by performing a full quantitative comparison between the continuum description of a one-dimensional gas of dipolar bosons in an optical lattice and the single-band Bose-Hubbard lattice model that it quantum simulates. By comparing energies and density distributions and calculating direct overlaps between the continuum and lattice many-body wave functions, we demonstrate that in regimes of strong DDIs and high densities the continuum system fails to recreate the desired lattice model. Two-band Hubbard models become necessary to reduce the discrepancy observed between continuum and lattice descriptions, but appreciable deviations in the density profile still remain. Our study elucidates the role of strong DDIs in generating physics beyond lowest-band descriptions and should offer a guideline for the calibration of near-term dipolar quantum simulators.

AB Ab initio electronic-structure has remained dichotomous between achievable accuracy and length-scale. Quantum many-body (QMB) methods realize quantum accuracy but fail to scale. Density functional theory (DFT) scales favorably but remains far from quantum accuracy. We present a framework that breaks this dichotomy by use of three interconnected modules: (i) invDFT: a methodological advance in inverse DFT linking QMB methods to DFT; (ii) MLXC: a machine-learned density functional trained with invDFT data, commensurate with quantum accuracy; (iii) DFT-FE-MLXC: an adaptive higher-order spectral finite-element (FE) based DFT implementation that integrates MLXC with efficient solver strategies and HPC innovations in FE-specific dense linear algebra, mixed-precision algorithms, and asynchronous compute-communication. We demonstrate a paradigm shift in DFT that not only provides an accuracy commensurate with QMB methods in ground-state energies, but also attains an unprecedented performance of 659.7 PFLOPS (43.1% peak FP64 performance) on 619,124 electrons using 8,000 GPU nodes of Frontier supercomputer.

Rich integrability structure is reflected also in transport: picking an arbitrary U(1) gate and varying the gate duration one will transition through different phases, including fractal ballistic transport, Kardar-Parisi-Zhang superdiffusion at the critical manifold that also contains helix states, diffusion, and localization. To correctly explain transport the non-local SU(2) symmetries do not matter, while the inhomogeneous local ones that almost commute with the propagator do.

The qubits' excited states have a very long controlled mean life time about several seconds. We can perform quantum computations by manipulating the qubits of electric dipolar molecules just like those of neutral atoms. When the qubits are used for quantum computations, the dipolar moments' orientations will harmonically oscillate along an external electric field and they will not change the directions: along or against the electric field, so the qubits can be large-scalely manufactured in graphene system. The radius of Rydberg blockade is about 100 nm.

TI Phonon pumping by modulating the ultrastrong vacuum
SO SCIPOST PHYSICS
AB The vacuum (i.e., the ground state) of a system in ultrastrong light-matter coupling contains particles that cannot be emitted without any dynamical perturbation and is thus called virtual. We propose a protocol for inducing and observing real mechanical excitations of a mirror enabled by the virtual photons in the ground state of a tripartite system, where a resonant optical cavity is ultrastrongly coupled to a two-level system (qubit) and, at the same time, optomechanically coupled to a mechanical resonator. Real phonons are coherently emitted when the frequency of the two-level system is modulated at a frequency comparable to that of the mechanical resonator and, therefore much lower than the optical frequency. We demonstrate that this hybrid effect is a direct consequence of the virtual photon population in the ground state. Within a classical physics analogy, attaching a weight to a spring only changes its resting position, whereas dynamically modulating the weight makes the system oscillate. In our case, however, the weight is the vacuum itself. We propose and accurately characterize a hybrid superconductingoptomechanical setup based on available state-of-the-art technology, where this effect can be experimentally observed.

TI Evolution of Quantum Systems with a Discrete Energy Spectrum in an
   Adiabatically Varying External Field
SO SYMMETRY-BASEL
AB We introduce a new approach for describing nonstationary quantum systems with a discrete energy spectrum. The essence of this approach is that we describe the evolution of a quantum system in a time-dependent basis. In a sense, this approach is similar to the description of the system in the interaction representation. However, the time dependence of the basic states of the representation is determined not by the evolution operator with a time-independent Hamiltonian but by the eigenstates of the time-dependent Hamiltonian defined at the current time. The time dependence of the basic states of the representation leads to the appearance of an additional term in the Schr & ouml;dinger equation, which in the case of slowly changing parameters of the Hamiltonian can be considered as a small perturbation. The adiabatic representation is suitable in cases where it is impossible to apply the standard interaction representation. The application of the adiabatic representation is illustrated by the example of two spins connected by a magnetic dipole-dipole interaction in a slowly varying external magnetic field.

TI Quantum Private Comparison Based on Four-Particle Cluster State
SO APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL
AB A quantum private comparison (QPC) protocol enables two parties to securely compare their private data without disclosing the actual values to one another, utilizing quantum mechanics to maintain confidentiality. Many current QPC protocols mainly concentrate on comparing the equality of private information between two users during a single execution, which restricts their scalability. To overcome this limitation, we present an efficient QPC protocol aimed at evaluating the equality of private information between two groups of users in one execution. This is achieved by leveraging the entanglement correlations present in each particle of a four-particle cluster state. In our approach, users encode their private data using bit flip or phase shift operators on the quantum sequence they receive, which is then sent back to a semi-trusted party which then determines whether the secrets of the two groups are equal and communicates the results to the users. By employing this method and facilitating the distributed transmission of the quantum sequence, our protocol achieves a qubit efficiency of 50%. Security analyses reveal that neither external attacks nor insider threats can successfully compromise the confidentiality of private data.

TI A multifunctional pseudo-[6]oxocarbon molecule innate to six accessible
   oxidation states
SO CHEM
AB Multi -electron redox behavior is common for inorganic compounds but exceptionally rare for organic molecules. Herein, the synthesis and full characterization of a simple organic molecule carrying the formula benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']tris([1,2,5]thiadiazole) 2,2,5,5,8,8-hexaoxide, abbreviated as tripak, are presented. Tripak constitutes a derivative of the thermodynamically unstable [6]oxocarbon C6O6, where all C=O groups are transformed into three dioxothiadiazole units, leaving a C6 ring in the center. The electron -withdrawing dioxothiadiazoles allow for a peerless uptake of six electrons by tripak in five consecutive reduction steps, and five of the six possible valence forms were fully investigated. Remarkably, the number of stored electrons elicits different types of aromaticity, ranging from non -aromatic to Hu<spacing diaeresis>ckel to Baird, and multifunctionality. Tripak0 features strong anion -Ts binding of halides. Tripak1- and tripak3- represent radicals, and the former is innate to qubit properties. Tripak2- is a blue dye with red fluorescence, and tripak4- emerges as a diradicaloid with a nearly zero singlet -triplet gap.

TI On the Refinement of Cartan Decomposition: An Implicit Commutative
   Substructure in su(2n)
SO RESULTS IN MATHEMATICS
AB The Cartan decomposition of a semisimple Lie algebra is pivotal in both theoretical exploration and practical application. It generalizes the classical spectral, polar, and singular value decompositions found in linear algebra. This paper explores an advanced refinement of the Cartan decomposition of su(2(n)), arising from the parameterization of a Hamiltonian for quantum simulation. Specifically, given an AI-type Cartan decomposition g = k circle plus p of any Lie subalgebra g in su(2(n)), where p = (p) over tilde circle plus h and is the maximal abelian subalgebra in p, it is revealed that both the subalgebra and the (p) over tilde corresponding (which is generally not a subalgebra) can further be partitioned, respectively, as the direct sums of equal-dimensional commutative Lie subalgebras. With respect to the involution theta(g) = -g(T), any Lie subalgebra g in su(2(n)) with nondegenerate Cartan decomposition can thus be fully decomposed as the orthogonal direct sum of h and pairs of commutative Lie subalgebras over k and (p) over tilde, all of which, except h, share the same dimension.

TI High-Energy Collision of Quarks and Mesons in the Schwinger Model: From
   Tensor Networks to Circuit QED
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB With the aim of studying nonperturbative out-of-equilibrium dynamics of high-energy particle collisions on quantum simulators, we investigate the scattering dynamics of lattice quantum electrodynamics in 1 + 1 dimensions. Working in the bosonized formulation of the model and in the thermodynamic limit, we use uniform-matrix-product-state tensor networks to construct multiparticle wave-packet states, evolve them in time, and detect outgoing particles post collision. This facilitates the numerical simulation of scattering experiments in both confined and deconfined regimes of the model at different energies, giving rise to rich phenomenology, including inelastic production of quark and meson states, meson disintegration, and dynamical string formation and breaking. We obtain elastic and inelastic scattering cross sections, together with time-resolved momentum and position distributions of the outgoing particles. Furthermore, we propose an analog circuit-QED implementation of the scattering process that is native to the platform, requires minimal ingredients and approximations, and enables practical schemes for particle wave-packet preparation and evolution. This study highlights the role of classical and quantum simulation in enhancing our understanding of scattering processes in quantum field theories in real time.

TI Deconstructing Vibrational Motions on the Potential Energy Surfaces of
   Hydrogen-Bonded Complexes
SO CCS CHEMISTRY
AB Internal vibrations underlie transient structure formation, spectroscopy, and dynamics. However, at least two challenges exist when aiming to elucidate the contributions of vibrational motions on the potential energy surfaces. One is the acquisition of well-resolved experimental infrared spectra, and the other is the development of efficient theoretical methodologies that reliably predict band positions, relative intensities, and substructures. Here, we report size-specific infrared spectra of ammonia clusters to address these two challenges. Unprecedented agreement between experiment and state-of-the-art quantum simulations reveals that the vibrational spectra are mainly contributed by proton-donor ammonia. A striking Fermi resonance observed at approximately 3210 and 3250 cm-1 originates from the coupling of NH symmetric stretch fundamentals with overtones of free and hydrogen-bonded NH bending, respectively. These novel, intriguing findings contribute to a better understanding of vibrational motions in a large variety of hydrogen-bonded complexes with orders of magnitude improvements in spectral resolution, efficiency, and specificity.

TI One-dimensional Kronig-Penney superlattices at the
   LaAlO3/SrTiO3 interface
SO NATURE PHYSICS
AB Semiconductor heterostructures(1) and ultracold neutral atomic lattices(2) capture many of the essential properties of one-dimensional electronic systems. However, fully one-dimensional superlattices are highly challenging to fabricate in the solid state due to the inherently small length scales involved. Conductive atomic force microscope lithography applied to an oxide interface can create ballistic few-mode electron waveguides with highly quantized conductance and strongly attractive electron-electron interactions(3). Here we show that artificial Kronig-Penney-like superlattice potentials can be imposed on such waveguides, introducing a new superlattice spacing that can be made comparable to the mean separation between electrons. The imposed superlattice potential fractures the electronic subbands into a manifold of new subbands with magnetically tunable fractional conductance. The lowest plateau, associated with ballistic transport of spin-singlet electron pairs(3), shows enhanced electron pairing, in some cases up to the highest magnetic fields explored. A one-dimensional model of the system suggests that an engineered spin-orbit interaction in the superlattice contributes to the enhanced pairing observed in the devices. These findings are an advance in the ability to design new families of quantum materials with emergent properties and the development of solid-state one-dimensional quantum simulation platforms.

TI Hunting for quantum-classical crossover in condensed matter problems
SO NPJ QUANTUM INFORMATION
AB The intensive pursuit for quantum advantage in terms of computational complexity has further led to a modernized crucial question of when and how will quantum computers outperform classical computers. The next milestone is undoubtedly the realization of quantum acceleration in practical problems. Here we provide a clear evidence and arguments that the primary target is likely to be condensed matter physics. Our primary contributions are summarized as follows: 1) Proposal of systematic error/runtime analysis on state-of-the-art classical algorithm based on tensor networks; 2) Dedicated and high-resolution analysis on quantum resource performed at the level of executable logical instructions; 3) Clarification of quantum-classical crosspoint for ground-state simulation to be within runtime of hours using only a few hundreds of thousand physical qubits for 2d Heisenberg and 2d Fermi-Hubbard models, assuming that logical qubits are encoded via the surface code with the physical error rate of p = 10-3. To our knowledge, we argue that condensed matter problems offer the earliest platform for demonstration of practical quantum advantage that is order-of-magnitude more feasible than ever known candidates, in terms of both qubit counts and total runtime.

TI Entanglement-enabled decoherence-free transmission of two-color photons
   through a single mode fiber
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB We demonstrate decoherence-tolerant transmission of a Bell state through a singlemode fiber (SMF) using the photon frequency degree of freedom. To this end, a slightly nondegenerate polarization-entangled singlet, |'F-⟩ = (|HV⟩ - |VH⟩)/ 2, is localized at the SMF as the depolarization channel subject to random noise due to incessant fiber bending. Two-photon beats and quantum state tomography jointly verify the absence of collective decoherence, showing that |'F-⟩ is the sought-after one-dimensional decoherence-free subspace (DFS) pertaining to SMF. Efficient splitting and combining of photon streams in our DFS help outperform the DFS in time domain. This motivates us to attempt DFS-enabled fault-tolerant fiber transmission of biphoton qubits. Two-photon BB84 protocol is implemented in a polarization-maintaining fiber to which dephasing noise is relevant so that a two-dimensional DFS is appropriate. A low bit error rate 5.4% is achieved by encoding one-qubit information onto the biphoton state in spite of significant polarization fluctuation. Our scalable frequency-based DFS has a natural affinity for wavelength division multiplexing in fiber communication by design and as such is extensible to multi-particle entanglement.

TI A Novel Semi-Quantum Private Comparison Scheme Using Bell Entangle
   States
SO CMC-COMPUTERS MATERIALS & CONTINUA
AB Private comparison is the basis of many encryption technologies, and several related Quantum Private Comparison (QPC) protocols have been published in recent years. In these existing protocols, secret information is encoded by using conjugate coding or orthogonal states, and all users are quantum participants. In this paper, a novel semi-quantum private comparison scheme is proposed, which employs Bell entangled states as quantum resources. Two semi-quantum participants compare the equivalence of their private information with the help of a semi-honest third party (TP). Compared with the previous classical protocols, these two semi-quantum users can only make some particular action, such as to measure, prepare and reflect quantum qubits only in the classical basis {vertical bar 0); vertical bar 1 >}, and TP needs to perform Bell basis measurement on reflecting qubits to obtain the results of the comparison. Further, analysis results show that this scheme can avoid outside and participant attacks and its' qubit efficiency is better than the other two protocols mentioned in the paper.

TI Measures of complexity and entanglement in many-fermion systems
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW C
AB There is no unique and widely accepted definition of the complexity measure (CM) of a many-fermion wave function in the presence of interactions. The simplest many-fermion wave function is a Slater determinant. In shell-model or configuration interaction (CI) and other related methods, the state is represented as a superposition of a large number of Slater determinants, which in the case of CI calculations reaches about 20 billion terms [Johnson, arXiv:1809.07869]. Although in practice this number has been used as a CM for decades, it is ill defined: it is not unique, and it depends on the particular type and the number of single-particle wave functions used to construct the Slater determinants. The canonical wave functions and/or natural orbitals [Lowdin, Adv. Phys. 5, 1 (1956); Lowdin and Shull, Phys. Rev. 101, 1730 (1956); Bardeen et al., Phys. Rev. 108, 1175 (1957); N. N. Bogoljubov, Il Nuovo Cimento 7, 794 (1958); Valatin, Il Nuovo Cimento 7, 843 (1958); de Gennes, Superconductivity of Metals and Alloys (CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL, 1999); Ring and Schuck, The Nuclear Many-Body Problem, 1st ed. (Springer-Verlag, Berlin, 2004)] and their corresponding occupation probabilities are intrinsic properties of any many-body wave function, irrespective of the representation, and they provide a unique solution to characterize the CM. The non-negative orbital entanglement entropy, which vanishes for a Slater determinant, provides the simplest CM, while a more complete measure of complexity is the entanglement spectrum. We illustrate these aspects in the case of a complex nonequilibrium time-dependent process, induced nuclear fission described within a real-time density functional theory framework extended to superfluid systems, which can describe simultaneously the long-range and the short-range correlations between fermions. The orbital entanglement entropy of the fissioning nucleus illustrates the localization mechanism of the many-body wave function in Fock and/or Hilbert space. The (minimal) number of Slater determinants required to represent such a complex many-body wave function with a well-defined number of particles in the case presented here is about 10500. The realistic case of the highly nonequilibrium nuclear fission process illustrated here is equivalent to a system of 23.328 x 109 interacting quantum spin-1/2 particles, a very large system for the study of quantum entanglement.

TI Observation of Near-Critical Kibble-Zurek Scaling in Rydberg Atom Arrays
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB The Kibble-Zurek scaling reveals the universal dynamics when a system is linearly ramped across a symmetry-breaking phase transition. However, in reality, inevitable finite-size effects or symmetrybreaking perturbations can often smear out the critical point and render the phase transition into a smooth crossover. In this Letter, we show experimentally that the precise Kibble-Zurek scaling can be retained in the near-critical crossover regime, not necessarily crossing the critical point strictly. The key ingredient to achieving this near-critical Kibble-Zurek scaling is that the system size and the symmetry-breaking field must be appropriately scaled following the variation of ramping speeds. The experiment is performed in a reconfigurable Rydberg atom array platform, where the Rydberg blockade effect induces a Z2 symmetrybreaking transition. The atom array platform enables precise control of the system size and the zigzag geometry as a symmetry-breaking field. Therefore, we can demonstrate notable differences in the precision of the Kibble-Zurek scaling with or without properly scaling the system size and the zigzag geometry. Our results strengthen the Kibble-Zurek scaling as an increasingly valuable tool for investigating phase transition in quantum simulation platforms.

TI Programmable All-Optical Spin Simulator with Artificial Gauge Fields
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB The coupling of lasers plays an important role in a variety of research activities, from generating highpower lasers to investigating out-of-equilibrium coupled systems. This Letter presents our investigations of Hermitian coupling in arrays of lasers, where it is possible to control both the amplitude and phase of the coupling and generate artificial gauge fields. The Hermitian coupling is demonstrated in three laser array geometries: a square array of 100 lasers with controlled laser coupling for obtaining continuous control over the phase-locked state, a triangular array of 130 lasers with controlled chirality of the lasers, and a ring array of eight lasers with a controlled topological charge. In the square array, we implemented arbitrary laser coupling with a precision of 2 pi=120 radians, enabling the attainment of arbitrary phase-locking states. In the triangular array, we controlled the chirality of the lasers with 99% purity. In the ring array, the introduction of an artificial gauge field revealed discrete quantized first-order transitions between distinct topological phase-locking states. The results pave the way for exploring spin systems with programmable coupling in an all-optical spin simulator.

TI Creation of an Fe3P Schreibersite Density Functional Tight
   Binding Model for Astrobiological Simulations
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY A
AB The mineral schreibersite, e.g., Fe3P, is commonly found in iron-rich meteorites and could have served as an abiotic phosphorus source for prebiotic chemistry. However, atomistic calculations of its degradation chemistry generally require quantum simulation approaches, which can be too computationally cumbersome to study sufficient time and length scales for this process. In this regard, we have created a computationally efficient semiempirical quantum density functional tight binding (DFTB) model for iron and phosphorus-containing materials by adopting an existing semiautomated workflow that represents many-body interactions by linear combinations of Chebyshev polynomials. We have utilized a relatively small training set to optimize a DFTB model that is accurate for schreibersite physical and chemical properties, including its bulk properties, surface energies, and water absorption. We then show that our model shows strong transferability to several iron phosphide solids as well as multiple allotropes of iron metal. Our resulting DFTB parametrization will allow us to interrogate schreibersite aqueous decomposition at longer time and length scales than standard quantum approaches, providing for more detailed investigations of its role in prebiotic chemistry on early Earth.

TI Observation of a Lee-Huang-Yang Fluid
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB We observe monopole oscillations in a mixture of Bose-Einstein condensates, where the usually dominant mean-field interactions are canceled. In this case, the system is governed by the next-order Lee-Huang-Yang (LHY) correction to the ground state energy, which describes the effect of quantum fluctuations. Experimentally such a LHY fluid is realized by controlling the atom numbers and interaction strengths in a K-39 spin mixture confined in a spherical trap potential. We measure the monopole oscillation frequency as a function of the LHY interaction strength as proposed recently by Jrgensen et al. [Phys. Rev. Lett. 121, 173403 (2018)] and find excellent agreement with simulations of the complete experiment including the excitation procedure and inelastic losses. This confirms that the system and its collective behavior are initially dominated by LHY interactions. Moreover, the monopole oscillation frequency is found to be stable against variations of the involved scattering lengths in a broad region around the ideal values, confirming the stabilizing effect of the LHY interaction. These results pave the way for using the nonlinearity provided by the LHY term in quantum simulation experiments and for investigations beyond the LHY regime.

TI Extracting Higher Central Charge from a Single Wave Function
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB A (2 + 1)D topologically ordered phase may or may not have a gappable edge, even if its chiral central charge c- is vanishing. Recently, it was discovered that a quantity regarded as a "higher" version of chiral central charge gives a further obstruction beyond c- to gapping out the edge. In this Letter, we show that the higher central charges can be characterized by the expectation value of the partial rotation operator acting on the wave function of the topologically ordered state. This allows us to extract the higher central charge from a single wave function, which can be evaluated on a quantum computer. Our characterization of the higher central charge is analytically derived from the modular properties of edge conformal field theory, as well as the numerical results with the nu = 1/2 bosonic Laughlin state and the non -Abelian gapped phase of the Kitaev honeycomb model, which corresponds to U(1)2 and Ising topological order, respectively. The Letter establishes a numerical method to obtain a set of obstructions to the gappable edge of (2 + 1)D bosonic topological order beyond c-, which enables us to completely determine if a (2 + 1)D bosonic Abelian topological order has a gappable edge or not. We also point out that the expectation values of the partial rotation on a single wave function put a constraint on the low -energy spectrum of the bulk -boundary system of (2 + 1)D bosonic topological order, reminiscent of the Lieb-Schultz-Mattis-type theorems.

TI The Li plus CaF → Ca plus LiF chemical reaction under cold conditions
SO PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY CHEMICAL PHYSICS
AB The calcium monofluoride (CaF) molecule has emerged as a promising candidate for precision measurements, quantum simulation, and ultracold chemistry experiments. Inelastic and reactive collisions of laser cooled CaF molecules in optical tweezers have recently been reported and collisions of cold Li atoms with CaF are of current experimental interest. In this paper, we report ab initio electronic structure and full-dimensional quantum dynamical calculations of the Li + CaF -> LiF + Ca chemical reaction. The electronic structure calculations are performed using the internally contracted multi-reference configuration-interaction method with Davidson correction (MRCI + Q). An analytic fit of the interaction energies is obtained using a many-body expansion method. A coupled-channel quantum reactive scattering approach implemented in hyperspherical coordinates is adopted for the scattering calculations under cold conditions. Results show that the Li + CaF reaction populates several low-lying vibrational levels and many rotational levels of the product LiF molecule and that the reaction is inefficient in the 1-100 mK regime allowing sympathetic cooling of CaF by collisions with cold Li atoms.

TI Super-Resolution Diamond Magnetic Microscopy of Superparamagnetic
   Nanoparticles
SO ACS NANO
AB Scanning-probe and wide-field magnetic microscopes based on nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamond have enabled advances in the study of biology and materials, but each method has drawbacks. Here, we implement an alternative method for nanoscale magnetic microscopy based on optical control of the charge state of NV centers in a dense layer near the diamond surface. By combining a donut-beam super-resolution technique with optically detected magnetic resonance spectroscopy, we imaged the magnetic fields produced by single 30 nm iron-oxide nanoparticles. The magnetic microscope has a lateral spatial resolution of similar to 100 nm, and it resolves the individual magnetic dipole features from clusters of nanoparticles with interparticle spacings down to similar to 190 nm. The magnetic feature amplitudes are more than an order of magnitude larger than those obtained by confocal magnetic microscopy due to the narrower optical point-spread function and the shallow depth of NV centers. We analyze the magnetic nanoparticle images and sensitivity as a function of the microscope's spatial resolution and show that the signal-to-noise ratio for nanoparticle detection does not degrade as the spatial resolution improves. We identify sources of background fluorescence that limit the present performance, including diamond second-order Raman emission and imperfect NV charge state control. Our method, which uses <10 mW laser power and can be parallelized by patterned illumination, introduces a promising format for nanoscale magnetic imaging.

TI Quantum loss sensing with two-mode squeezed vacuum state under noisy and
   lossy environment
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB We investigate quantum advantages in loss sensing when the two-mode squeezed vacuum state is used as a probe. Following an experimental demonstration in PRX 4, 011049, we consider a quantum scheme in which the signal mode is passed through the target and a thermal noise is introduced to the idler mode before they are measured. We consider two detection strategies of practical relevance: coincidence-counting and intensity-difference measurement, which are widely used in quantum sensing and imaging experiments. By computing the signal-to-noise ratio, we verify that quantum advantages persist even under strong thermal background noise, in comparison with the classical scheme which uses a single-mode coherent state that directly suffers from the thermal noise. Such robustness comes from the fact that the signal mode suffers from the thermal noise in the classical scheme, while in the quantum scheme, the idler mode does. For a fairer comparison, we further investigate a different setup in which the thermal noise is introduced to the signal mode in the quantum schemes. In this new setup, we show that the quantum advantages are significantly reduced. Remarkably, however, under an optimum measurement scheme associated with the quantum Fisher information, we show that the two-mode squeezed vacuum state does exhibit a quantum advantage over the entire range of the environmental noise and loss. We expect this work to serve as a guide for experimental demonstrations of quantum advantages in loss parameter sensing, which is subject to lossy and noisy environment.

TI General-purpose quantum architecture search based on deep reinforcement
   learning
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Reinforcement learning (RL) shows promise for automated quantum circuit design but often stalls due to a "fidelity trap": by optimizing only state fidelity, agents overlook entanglement structure and become stranded in suboptimal, overly complex circuits, resulting in significantly reduced search efficiency. In this paper, we propose a scheme that overcomes this barrier by implementing an entanglement-aware learning framework and enhancing the agent's reward function with a direct, quantitative measure of entanglement. This approach offers a more comprehensive physical description of the state space. We demonstrate the efficacy of this principle on three- and four-qubit state-synthesis tasks within an expanded gate set. For this problem, where the fidelity-driven agent systematically fails to discover the minimal-depth circuit, our entanglement-aware agent consistently succeeds. This transformative result is highly robust against variations in initial random seeds and extends to multiqubit systems even in the presence of noise. Our findings establish a generalizable principle that incorporating entanglement as an auxiliary reward can significantly enhance RL-based solutions for a broad class of fidelity-centric tasks in quantum physics and pave the way for scalable, automated discovery on near-term quantum devices.

TI Entangling Interactions Between Artificial Atoms Mediated by a Multimode
   Left-Handed Superconducting Ring Resonator
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB Superconducting metamaterial transmission lines implemented with lumped circuit elements can exhibit left-handed dispersion, where the group and phase velocity have opposite sign, in a frequency range relevant for superconducting artificial atoms. Forming such a metamaterial transmission line into a ring and coupling it to qubits at different points around the ring results in a multimode bus resonator with a compact footprint. Using flux -tunable qubits, we characterize and theoretically model the variation in the coupling strength between the two qubits and each of the ring -resonator modes. Although the qubits have negligible direct coupling between them, their interactions with the multimode ring resonator result in both a transverse exchange coupling and a higher -order ZZ interaction between the qubits. As we vary the detuning between the qubits and their frequency relative to the ring -resonator modes, we observe significant variations in both of these interqubit interactions, including zero crossings and changes of sign. The ability to modulate interaction terms such as the ZZ scale between zero and large values for small changes in qubit frequency provides a promising pathway for implementing entangling gates in a system capable of hosting many qubits.

TI Topology, criticality, and dynamically generated qubits in a stochastic
   measurement-only Kitaev model
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
AB We consider a paradigmatic solvable model of topological order in two dimensions, Kitaev's honeycomb Hamiltonian, and turn it into a measurement-only dynamics consisting of stochastic measurements of two-qubit bond operators. We find an entanglement phase diagram that resembles that of the Hamiltonian problem in some ways, while being qualitatively different in others. When one type of bond is dominantly measured, we find area-law entangled phases that protect two topological qubits (on a torus) for a time exponential in system size. This generalizes the recently proposed idea of Floquet codes, where logical qubits are dynamically generated by a time-periodic measurement schedule, to a stochastic setting. When all types of bonds are measured with comparable frequency, we find a critical phase with a logarithmic violation of the area law, which sharply distinguishes it from its Hamiltonian counterpart. The critical phase has the same set of topological qubits, as diagnosed by the tripartite mutual information, but protects them only for a time polynomial in system size. Furthermore, we observe an unusual behavior for the dynamical purification of mixed states, characterized at late times by the dynamical exponent z = 1/2, a superballistic dynamics made possible by measurements.

TI Experimentally Verified, Fast Analytic, and Numerical Design of
   Superconducting Resonators in Flip-Chip Architectures
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON QUANTUM ENGINEERING
AB In superconducting quantum processors, the predictability of device parameters is of increasing importance as many laboratories scale up their systems to larger sizes in a 3-D-integrated architecture. In particular, the properties of superconducting resonators must be controlled well to ensure high-fidelity multiplexed readout of qubits. Here, we present a method, based on conformal mapping techniques, to predict a resonator's parameters directly from its 2-D cross-section, without computationally heavy and time-consuming 3-D simulation. We demonstrate the method's validity by comparing the calculated resonator frequency and coupling quality factor with those obtained through 3-D finite-element-method simulation and by measurement of 15 resonators in a flip-chip-integrated architecture. We achieve a discrepancy of less than 2% between designed and measured frequencies for 6-GHz resonators. We also propose a design method that reduces the sensitivity of the resonant frequency to variations in the interchip spacing.

TI Symmetry resolved entanglement of excited states in quantum field
   theory. Part I. Free theories, twist fields and qubits
SO JOURNAL OF HIGH ENERGY PHYSICS
AB The excess entanglement resulting from exciting a finite number of quasiparticles above the ground state of a free integrable quantum field theory has been investigated quite extensively in the literature. It has been found that it takes a very simple form, depending only on the number of excitations and their statistics. There is now mounting evidence that such formulae also apply to interacting and even higher-dimensional quantum theories. In this paper we study the entanglement content of such zero-density excited states focusing on the symmetry resolved entanglement, that is on 1+1D quantum field theories that possess an internal symmetry. The ratio of charged moments between the excited and grounds states, from which the symmetry resolved entanglement entropy can be obtained, takes a very simple and universal form, which in addition to the number and statistics of the excitations, now depends also on the symmetry charge. Using form factor techniques, we obtain both the ratio of moments and the symmetry resolved entanglement entropies in complex free theories which possess U(1) symmetry. The same formulae are found for simple qubit states.

TI Tailoring optical emission of silicon-vacancy centers in two-dimensional
   diamond nanosheets via a two-step oxidation approach
SO FUNCTIONAL DIAMOND
AB Incorporating two-dimensional (2D) diamond nanosheets with fluorescent color centers exhibits great potential in the application of quantum sensing. However, color centers always show poor optical emission in chemical-vapor-deposited (CVD) diamond nanomaterials. To address this issue, Si doped diamond/graphite hybrid films were successfully fabricated in microwave-plasma CVD device. The films consist of diamond-core/graphite-shell nanosheets with high amount of diamond nanocrystalline particles. Two post treatments of acid oxidation and annealing in air were used to tailor photoluminescence (PL) of silicon-vacancy (SiV) centers. The SiV centers in the oxidized samples exhibit small PL increase compared with the as-deposited samples with SiV PL quenching. It is found that the graphite phase is selectively etched away with the presence of nanocrystalline diamond particles during the treatment of acid oxidation while the nanocrystalline diamond particles are efficiently removed with the presence of graphite using the air annealing method. Based on this result, a two-step approach of acid oxidation followed by air annealing was conducted to etch the non-diamond phase, forming diamond nanosheets. The SiV centers exhibit significant PL enhancement with a maximum value of 28 folds, compared with the single-step oxidized samples. The Raman and XPS results reveal that such PL increase originates from direct bonding of oxygen on the sp3 carbon. Therefore, our work provides a feasible approach to prepare 2D diamond nanosheets with high-brightness color centers.

TI Engineering Optically Active Defects in Hexagonal Boron Nitride Using
   Focused Ion Beam and Water
SO ACS NANO
AB Hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) has emerged as a promising material platform for nanophotonics and quantum sensing, hosting optically active defects with exceptional properties such as high brightness and large spectral tuning. However, precise control over deterministic spatial positioning of emitters in hBN remained elusive for a long time, limiting their proper correlative characterization and applications in hybrid devices. Recently, focused ion beam (FIB) systems proved to be useful to engineer several types of spatially defined emitters with various structural and photophysical properties. Here we systematically explore the physical processes leading to the creation of optically active defects in hBN using FIB and find that beam-substrate interaction plays a key role in the formation of defects. These findings are confirmed using transmission electron microscopy, which reveals local mechanical deterioration of the hBN layers and local amorphization of ion beam irradiated hBN. Additionally, we show that, upon exposure to water, amorphized hBN undergoes a structural and optical transition between two defect types with distinctive emission properties. Moreover, using super-resolution optical microscopy combined with atomic force microscopy, we pinpoint the exact location of emitters within the defect sites, confirming the role of defected edges as primary sources of fluorescent emission. This lays the foundation for FIB-assisted engineering of optically active defects in hBN with high spatial and spectral control for applications ranging from integrated photonics, to nanoscale sensing, and to nanofluidics.

TI Interaction between giant atoms in a one-dimensional structured
   environment
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Giant atoms, quantum emitters that couple to light at multiple discrete points, are emerging as a new paradigm in quantum optics due to their many promising properties, such as decoherence-free interaction. While most previous work has considered giant atoms coupled to open continuous waveguides or a single giant atom coupled to a structured bath, here we study the interaction between two giant atoms mediated by a structured waveguide, e.g., a photonic crystal waveguide. This environment is characterized by a finite energy band and a band gap, which affect atomic dynamics beyond the Markovian regime. Here we show that, inside the band, decoherence-free interaction is possible for different atom-cavity detunings, but is degraded from the continuous-waveguide case by time delay and other non-Markovian effects. Outside the band, where atoms interact through the overlap of bound states, we find that giant atoms can interact more strongly and over longer distances than small atoms for some parameters, for instance, when restricting the maximum coupling strength achievable per coupling point. The results presented here may find applications in quantum simulation and quantum gate implementation.

TI Simulating graphene dynamics in synthetic space with photonic rings
SO COMMUNICATIONS PHYSICS
AB Photonic honeycomb lattices have attracted broad interests for their fruitful ways in manipulating light, which yet hold difficulties in achieving arbitrary reconfigurability and hence flexible functionality due to fixed geometry configurations. Here we theoretically propose to construct the honeycomb lattice in a one-dimensional ring array under dynamic modulations, with an additional synthetic dimension created by connecting the frequency degree of freedom of light. Such a system is highly re-configurable with parameters flexibly controlled by external modulations. Therefore, various physical phenomena associated with graphene including Klein tunneling, valley-dependent edge states, effective magnetic field, as well as valley-dependent Lorentz force can be simulated in this lattice, which exhibits important potentials for manipulating photons in different ways. Our work unveils an alternative platform for constructing the honeycomb lattice in a synthetic space, which holds complex functionalities and could be important for optical signal processing as well as quantum simulation.
   Photonic honeycomb lattices have attracted attention for their interesting optical properties, but are complicated to reconfigure after fabrication. This work proposes to reduce this complexity to a 1D ring-resonator array by using only one real dimension and one synthetic dimension.

TI Ground state of Rydberg-dressed Bose gas confined in periodic moire
   lattices*
SO ACTA PHYSICA SINICA
AB The experimental realization of Rydberg dressing and spin-orbit coupling greatly broadens the research field of ultracold atoms as a quantum simulation platform. Very recently, moire lattices have attracted intensive study, ranging from condensed matter to ultracold physics. In this paper, the ground-state structure of Rydberg-dressed Bose gas with spin-orbit coupling and confined in moire lattices is studied, and the effects of nonlocal Rydberg interaction and spin-orbit coupling on the ground state of the system are explored. Our results show that the system has no translational symmetry due to the presence of nonlocal Rydberg interaction, and more and more regular periodic structures present with the increases of the strength of nonlocal Rydberg interaction. In the presence of spin-orbit coupling, the Hamiltonian of the system has an imaginary part, and the phase of the system is not uniformly distributed. It is found that the ground state of the system with spin-orbit coupling present more abundant internal structure base on these periodic structures. The results pave the way for future study of moire physics in ultracold atom system.

TI Few quantum walkers for the generation of vortex creep on bosonic flux
   ladders
SO NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB We investigate the quantum-classical correspondence of vortex creep within the framework of quantum ladder lattice with artificial gauge. By introducing operators to characterize microscopic vortices in the bosonic flux ladder, we focus on quantum walks initiated from states with one, two and four particles localized at the central sites of the ladder. In the single-particle systems, we observe an asymmetric spreading of vortices stemming from the specific construction of the initial states and the gauge choice. In the two- and four-particle systems, comparisons across different conditions reveal that the individual application of flux and interactions slows down particle propagation due to pairing and vortex formation. Notably, when both flux and interaction are present concurrently, our results demonstrate that the mean square displacement (MSD) of the vortices grows significantly slower than the typical MSD similar to t2 for quantum walk, instead approaching the characteristic behavior of classical walk MSD similar to t. This indicates that the observed spreading process is consistent with the classical walk of vortices formed by circulating particles, i.e. vortex creep in superconductors.

TI Polariton creation in coupled cavity arrays with spectrally disordered
   emitters
SO MATERIALS FOR QUANTUM TECHNOLOGY
AB Integrated photonics has been a promising platform for analog quantum simulation of condensed matter phenomena in strongly correlated systems. To that end, we explore the implementation of all-photonic quantum simulators in coupled cavity arrays with integrated ensembles of spectrally disordered emitters. Our model is reflective of color center ensembles integrated into photonic crystal cavity arrays. Using the Quantum Master equation and the Effective Hamiltonian approaches, we study energy band formation and wavefunction properties in the open quantum Tavis-Cummings-Hubbard framework. We find conditions for polariton creation and (de)localization under experimentally relevant values of disorder in emitter frequencies, cavity resonance frequencies, and emitter-cavity coupling rates. To quantify these properties, we introduce two metrics, the polaritonic and nodal participation ratios, that characterize the light-matter hybridization and the node delocalization of the wavefunction, respectively. These new metrics combined with the Effective Hamiltonian approach prove to be a powerful toolbox for cavity quantum electrodynamical engineering of solid-state systems.

TI Probing Critical Behavior of Long-Range Transverse-Field Ising Model
   through Quantum Kibble-Zurek Mechanism
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB The trapped-ion quantum simulator has demonstrated qualitative properties of different physical models for up to tens of ions. In particular, a linear ion chain naturally hosts long-range Ising interactions under the laser driving, which has been used for various phenomena, such as quantum phase transition, localization, thermalization, and information propagation. For near-term practical usage, a central task is to find more quantitative applications of the noisy quantum simulators that are robust to small errors in the parameters. Here we report the quantum simulation of a long-range transverse-field Ising model using up to 61 ions and probe the critical behavior of its quantum phase transition through the Kibble-Zurek mechanism. By calibrating and verifying the coupling coefficients, we realize the same model for increasing ion numbers, so as to extract a critical exponent free of the finite-size effect. For ferromagnetic interaction, our exper-imental result agrees with the previous numerical prediction. As for the antiferromagnetic case, signals are too weak to fit a critical exponent due to the frustration in the interaction, but still consistent with the theory.

TI Tuning Electron Spin Coherence in Carbon Nanospheres through Defect
   Engineering
SO ACS NANO
AB This study investigates spin decoherence in large disordered carbon nanosphere (CNS) particles with a focus on predicting and extending the electron spin qubit decoherence time (T 2). We present and experimentally validate a simple analytical model that predicts T 2 and reveal how defects-such as carbon vacancies, hydrogen chemisorption, and substitutional impurities-along with their concentration and distribution, impact T 2. This model offers insights into the interplay among spin density distribution, structural defects, and isotopic composition, demonstrating the role of defect minimization through controlled annealing in enhancing spin coherence. Through comparison with experimental data, we validate our model and demonstrate that spin polarization in the CNS is likely evenly distributed over a characteristic region of approximately 5 nm for T 2 similar to 200 ns. Based on these findings, we propose a synthetic protocol involving a confined annealing procedure that extends the spin lifetime in the CNS to up to 362 ns. With observed improvements in T 2, our findings provide valuable guidelines for optimizing electron spin coherence time in quantum devices and spintronic applications.

TI 3XOR Games with Perfect Commuting Operator Strategies Have Perfect
   Tensor Product Strategies and are Decidable in Polynomial Time
SO COMMUNICATIONS IN MATHEMATICAL PHYSICS
AB We consider 3XOR games with perfect commuting operator strategies. Given any 3XOR game, we show existence of a perfect commuting operator strategy for the game can be decided in polynomial time. Previously this problem was not known to be decidable. Our proof leads to a construction, showing a 3XOR game has a perfect commuting operator strategy iff it has a perfect tensor product strategy using a 3 qubit (8 dimensional) GHZ state. This shows that for perfect 3XOR games the advantage of a quantum strategy over a classical strategy (defined by the quantum-classical bias ratio) is bounded. This is in contrast to the general 3XOR case where the optimal quantum strategies can require high dimensional states and there is no bound on the quantum advantage. To prove these results, we first show equivalence between deciding the value of an XOR game and solving an instance of the subgroup membership problem on a class of right angled Coxeter groups. We then show, in a proof that consumes most of this paper, that the instances of this problem corresponding to 3XOR games can be solved in polynomial time.

TI Negatively charged boron vacancy center in diamond
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
AB Impurity-vacancy complexes in diamond are an attractive family of spin defects since NV-, SiV-, GeV-, and SnV- have emerged as promising platforms for quantum applications. Although boron is most easily incorporated into diamond, a boron-vacancy complex in the negative charge state (BV-) has eluded experimental observation. This center was theoretically predicted as another promising spin qubit. In this work, we experimentally observed an electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectrum identified as BV- in synthetic diamonds via a Fermi-level tuning. Fingerprints of BV- such as the spin multiplicity of S = 1, C-3v symmetry, and the zero-field splitting (D = 2913 MHz), in addition to B-10 and B-11 hyperfine (HF) interactions, have been confirmed. Moreover, optically pumped spin polarization has been observed with 3.0-3.6 eV excitation. However, unlike the NV- center, the photoluminescence as well as optically detected magnetic resonance from BV- have not been confirmed even at low temperatures. We speculate that the Jahn-Teller instability in the triplet excited states of the NV- and BV- centers results in different optical properties.

TI Harmonic dual dressing of spin-1/2 systems
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Controlled modifications of the magnetic response of a two-level system are produced in dressed systems by one high-frequency, strong, and nonresonant electromagnetic field. This quantum control is greatly enhanced and enriched by a harmonic, commensurable, and orthogonally oriented dual dressing, as discussed here. The secondary field enables a fine tuning of the qubit response, with control parameter amplitude, harmonic content, spatial orientation, and phase relation. Our analysis, mainly based on a perturbative approach with respect to the driving strength, includes also nonperturbative numerical solutions. The Zeeman response becomes anisotropic in a triaxial geometry and includes a nonlinear quadratic contribution. The long-time dynamics is described by an anisotropic effective magnetic field representing the handle for the system full engineering. Through the low-order harmonic mixing, the bichromatic driving generates a synthetic static field modifying the system dynamics. The spin temporal evolution includes a micromotion at harmonics of the driving frequency whose role in the spin detection is examined. Our dressing increases the two-level energy splitting, improving the spin detection sensitivity. In the weak-field direction it compensates the static fields applied in different geometries. The results presented here lay a foundation for additional applications to be harnessed in quantum simulations.

TI Investigation of Microwave Loss Induced by Oxide Regrowth in High-Q
   Niobium Resonators
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW APPLIED
AB The coherence of state-of-the-art superconducting qubit devices is predominantly limited by two-levelsystem defects, which are found primarily at amorphous interface layers. Reducing microwave loss from these interfaces by proper surface treatments is key to pushing the device performance forward. Here, we study niobium resonators after removing the native oxides with a hydrofluoric acid etch. We investigate the reappearance of microwave losses introduced by surface oxides that grow after exposure to air. We find that microwave loss in resonators are reduced by approximately an order of magnitude: internal Q factors increase from 1 x 106 to 7 x 106 in the single-photon regime when oxides are removed and device exposure to air is no longer than 16 min. Furthermore, we observe that Nb2O5 is the only surface oxide that grows significantly within the first 200 h, following the extended Cabrera-Mott growth model. In this time, microwave losses scale linearly with the Nb2O5 thickness, with an extracted loss tangent, tan delta Nb2O5, of about 1 x 10-2. Our findings are of particular interest for devices spanning from superconducting qubits, quantum-limited amplifiers, and microwave kinetic inductance detectors to single-photon detectors.

TI Progress and perspectives on weak-value amplification
SO PROGRESS IN QUANTUM ELECTRONICS
AB Weak-value amplification (WVA) is a metrological protocol that effectively amplifies ultra-small physical effects, making it highly applicable in the fields of quantum sensing and metrology. However, the amplification effect is achieved through post-selection, which leads to a significant decrease in signal intensity. Consequently, there is a heated debate regarding the trade-off between the amplification effect and the success probability of post-selection, questioning whether WVA surpasses conventional measurement (CM) in terms of measurement precision. Extensive research indicates that the specific theoretical assumptions and experimental conditions play crucial roles in determining the respective advantages of WVA and CM. WVA provides new perspectives for recognizing the important role of post-selection in precision metrology. It demonstrates significant advantages in two aspects: (i) WVA based on the phase space interaction provides feasible strategies to practically achieve the Heisenberg-scaling precision using only classical resources. (ii) WVA exhibits robustness against certain types of technical noise and imperfections of detectors. Moreover, WVA allows for various modifications to extend the applicable scope and enhance the metrological performance in corresponding situations. Despite substantial progress in recent years, the inherent connection between the advantages of WVA and its unique features remains incompletely understood. In this paper, we systematically review the recent advances in the WVA scheme, with a particular focus on the ultimate precision of WVA under diverse conditions. Our objective is to provide a comprehensive perspective on the benefits of WVA in precision measurement and facilitate the realization of its full potential.

TI Isotope-agnostic motional ground-state cooling of neutral Yb atoms
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Efficient high-fidelity ground-state cooling of motional degrees of freedom is crucial for applications in quantum simulation, computing, and metrology. Here, we demonstrate direct ground-state cooling of fermionic 171Yb and bosonic 174Yb atoms in two-and three-dimensional magic-wavelength optical lattices on the ultranarrow clock transition. Its high spectral resolution offers the potential for reaching extremely low temperatures. To ensure efficient cooling, we develop a chirped sideband cooling scheme, where we sweep the clock-laser frequency to mitigate the effects of spatial trap inhomogeneities. We further generalize the theoretical description of sideband spectra to higher-dimensional lattices for precise thermometry. We achieve 2D ground-state fractions of 97% for 171Yb with an average motional occupation of n<overline> 0.015 and provide a direct comparison with 174Yb, reaching similar cooling performance. Applying the same scheme in 3D results in n<overline> 0.15 limited by layer-to-layer inhomogeneities in the vertical direction. These results demonstrate efficient motional ground-state cooling in optical lattices, especially for bosonic alkaline-earth(-like) atoms, where other methods are not applicable, opening the door to novel protocols for quantum science applications with neutral atoms.

TI Accelerating the approach of dissipative quantum spin systems towards
   stationarity through global spin rotations
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB We consider open quantum systems whose dynamics is governed by a time-independent Markovian Lindblad master equation. Such systems approach their stationary state on a timescale that is determined by the spectral gap of the generator of the master equation dynamics. In a recent paper [Carollo et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 127, 060401 (2021)] it was shown that under certain circumstances it was possible to exponentially accelerate the approach to stationarity by performing a unitary transformation of the initial state. This phenomenon can be regarded as the quantum version of the so-called Mpemba effect. The transformation of the initial state removes its overlap with the dynamical mode of the open system dynamics that possesses the slowest decay rate and, thus, determines the spectral gap. Whereas this transformation can be exactly constructed in some cases, it is, in practice, challenging to implement. Here we show that even far simpler transformations constructed by a global unitary spin rotation allow to exponentially speed up relaxation. We demonstrate this using simple dissipative quantum spin systems, which are relevant for current quantum simulation and computation platforms based on trapped atoms and ions.

TI A Two-Party Quantum Parliament
SO ALGORITHMS
AB This paper introduces the first functional model of a quantum parliament that is dominated by two parties or coalitions, and may or may not contain independent legislators. We identify a single crucial parameter, aptly named free will radius, which can be used as a practical measure of the quantumness of the parties and the parliament as a whole. The free will radius used by the two parties determines the degree of independence that is afforded to the representatives of the parties. Setting the free will radius to zero degrades the quantum parliament to a classical one. On the other hand, setting the free will radius to its maximum value 1 makes the representatives totally independent. Moreover, we present a quantum circuit in Qiskit with which we simulate the operation of the quantum parliament under various scenarios. The experimental results allow us to arrive at some novel and fundamental conclusions that, we believe, provide new insights into the operation and the traits of a possible future quantum parliament. Finally, we propose the game "Passing the Bill," which captures the operation of the quantum parliament and basic options available to the leadership of the two parties.

TI Fractionalized prethermalization in the one-dimensional Hubbard model
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
AB Prethermalization phenomena in driven systems are generally understood via a local Floquet Hamiltonian obtained from a high-frequency expansion. Remarkably, recently it has been shown that a driven Kitaev spin liquid with fractionalized excitations can realize a quasistationary state that is not captured by this paradigm. Instead distinct types of fractionalized excitations are characterized by vastly different temperatures-a phenomenon dubbed fractionalized prethermalization. In our work, we analyze fractionalized prethermalization in a driven one-dimensional Hubbard model at strong coupling which hosts spin-charge fractionalization. At intermediate frequencies quasisteady states emerge which are characterized by a low spin and high charge temperature with lifetimes set by two competing processes: the lifetime of the quasiparticles determined by Fermi's Golden rule and the exponentially long lifetime of a Floquet prethermal plateau. We classify drives into three categories, each giving rise to distinct (fractional) prethermalization dynamics. Resorting to a time-dependent variant of the Schrieffer-Wolff transformation, we systematically analyze how these drive categories are linked to the underlying driven Hubbard model, thereby providing a general understanding of the emergent thermalization dynamics. We discuss routes toward an experimental realization of this phenomenon in quantum simulation platforms.

TI Finite-temperature spectrum at the symmetry-breaking linear to zigzag
   transition
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
AB We investigate the normal-mode spectrum of a trapped ion chain at the symmetry-breaking linear to zigzag transition and at finite temperatures. For this purpose, we modulate the amplitude of the Doppler cooling laser to excite and measure mode oscillations. The expected mode softening at the critical point, a signature of the second-order transition, is not observed. Numerical simulations show that this is mainly due to the finite temperature of the chain. Inspection of the trajectories suggest that the thermal shifts of the normal-mode spectrum can be understood by the ions collectively jumping between the two ground-state configurations of the symmetry-broken phase. We develop an effective analytical model, which allows us to reproduce the low-frequency spectrum as a function of the temperature and close to the transition point. In this model, the frequency shift of the soft mode is due to the anharmonic coupling with the high-frequency modes of the spectrum, acting as an averaged effective thermal environment. Our study could prove important for implementing ground-state laser cooling close to the critical point.

TI Generation of shallow nitrogen-vacancy centers in diamond with carbon
   ion implantation
SO ACTA PHYSICA SINICA
AB The shallow nitrogen-vacancy center of diamond exhibits excellent sensitivity and resolution in the magnetic detection and quantum sensing areas. Compared with other methods, low-energy carbon ion implantation does not need high-purity diamond nor introduce new impurity atoms, but the formation mechanism of nitrogen-vacancy center is not clear. In this work, shallow nitrogen-vacancy centers are created in the diamond by low energy carbon ion implantation and vacuum annealing, and the transformation mechanism of nitrogen-vacancy centers in diamond is studied by Raman spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and positron annihilation analysis. The results show that shallow nitrogen-vacancy centers can be obtained by carbon ion implantation combined with vacuum annealing. After implantation, superficial layer of diamond shows the damage zone including lattice distortion and amorphous carbon, and carbon-vacancy cluster defects (carbon atoms are surrounded by vacancy clusters) are generated. In the vacuum annealing process, the damaged area gradually transforms into the diamond structure through the recovery of the distortion area and the solid-phase epitaxy of the amorphous carbon area, accompanied by the continuous dissociation of carbon-vacancy cluster defects. When samples are annealed at 850 and 900 degrees C, the structure of the damaged area is partially repaired. While annealing at 950 degrees C, not only the damaged layer is basically recovered, but also nitrogen atoms capture the single vacancy obtained by the dissociation of carbon vacancy clusters, forming the nitrogen-vacancy centers.

TI An Engineer's Brief Introduction to Microwave Quantum Optics and a
   Single-Port State-Space Representation
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON QUANTUM ENGINEERING
AB Classical microwave circuit theory is incapable of representing some phenomena at the quantum level. To include quantum statistical effects, various theoretical treatments can be employed. Quantum input-output network (QION) theory is one such treatment. Another formalism, called SLH theory, incorporates scattering matrices (S), coupling vectors (L), and system Hamiltonians (H). These theoretical treatments require a reformulation of classical microwave theory. To make these topics comprehensible to an electrical engineer, we demonstrate some underpinnings of microwave quantum optics in terms of microwave engineering. For instance, we equate traveling-wave phasors in a transmission line (V-0(+)) directly to bosonic field operators. Furthermore, we extend QION to include a state-space representation and a transfer function for a single port quantum network. This serves as a case study to highlight how microwave methodologies can be applied in open quantum systems. Although the same conclusion could be found from a full SLH theory treatment, our method was derived directly from first principles of QION.

TI Impact of the central frequency of environment on non-Markovian dynamics
   in piezoelectric optomechanical devices
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB The piezoelectric optomechanical devices supply a promising experimental platform to realize the coherent and effective control and measurement of optical circuits working in Terahertz (THz) frequencies via superconducting electron devices typically working in Radio (MHz) frequencies. However, quantum fluctuations are unavoidable when the size of mechanical oscillators enter into the nanoscale. The consequences of the noisy environment are still challenging due to the lack of analytical tools. In this paper, a semi-classical and full-quantum model of piezoelectric optomechanical systems coupled to a noisy bosonic quantum environment are introduced and solved in terms of quantum-state diffusion (QSD) trajectories in the non-Markovian regime. We show that the noisy environment, particularly the central frequency of the environment, can enhance the entanglement generation between optical cavities and LC circuits in some parameter regimes. Moreover, we observe the critical points in the coefficient functions, which can lead the different behaviors in the system. Besides, we also witness the entanglement transfers between macroscopic objects due to the memory effect of the environment. Our work can be applied in the fields of electric/ optical switches, and long-distance distribution in a large-scale quantum network.

TI First and Second Law of Thermodynamics Constraints in the Lifshitz
   Theory of Dispersion Forces
SO ATOMS
AB The presence of dominant interatomic dispersion forces on the nanoscale holds the promise for breakthrough applications in key areas of quantum sensing, such as accelerometry, as well as nano-manipulation and energy storage. In order to do work, nano-machines enabled by dispersion forces must exchange energy with the surrounding environment. Such processes can be described in terms of thermodynamical engine cycles involving individual atoms or material boundaries, separated by possibly empty gaps and interacting via time-dependent dispersion forces. The fundamental strategy indispensable to achieve dispersion force time-modulation, demonstrated experimentally by independent groups on different scales, is based on the illumination of interacting, semiconducting elements by appropriate radiation beams. Here we analyze the operation of ideal nano-engines in the quasi-static regime by means of the Lifshitz theory of dispersion forces involving semiconducting boundary or atom irradiation. Firstly, we verify that the First Law of Thermodynamics is satisfied so that the total energy of the system is rigorously conserved. Secondly, we show that, within this first approximate treatment, the Second Law of Thermodynamics may be violated for extremely small interboundary gap widths. We identify important limitations to be addressed to determine whether this is a reliable conclusion. The technological and historic backdrops are presented, and important topics for future research are identified.

TI Fully-Optimized Quantum Metrology: Framework, Tools, and Applications
SO ADVANCED QUANTUM TECHNOLOGIES
AB This tutorial introduces a systematic approach for addressing the key question of quantum metrology: For a generic task of sensing an unknown parameter, what is the ultimate precision given a constrained set of admissible strategies. The approach outputs the maximal attainable precision (in terms of the maximum of quantum Fisher information) as a semidefinite program and optimal strategies as feasible solutions thereof. Remarkably, the approach can identify the optimal precision for different sets of strategies, including parallel, sequential, quantum SWITCH-enhanced, causally superposed, and generic indefinite-causal-order strategies. The tutorial consists of a pedagogic introduction to the background and mathematical tools of optimal quantum metrology, a detailed derivation of the main approach, and various concrete examples. As shown in the tutorial, applications of the approach include, but are not limited to, strict hierarchy of strategies in noisy quantum metrology, memory effect in non-Markovian metrology, and designing optimal strategies. Compared with traditional approaches, the approach here yields the exact value of the optimal precision, offering more accurate criteria for experiments and practical applications. It also allows for the comparison between conventional strategies and the recently discovered causally-indefinite strategies, serving as a powerful tool for exploring this new area of quantum metrology.
   This tutorial provides a meticulous exploration of quantum metrology, introducing a systematic framework as a valuable tool for optimizing precision in quantum sensing. It guides readers through optimization techniques, practical applications, and the intricacies of quantum control, serving as a useful resource for those delving into quantum parameter estimation. image

TI Scattering of mesons in quantum simulators
SO NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB Simulating real-time evolution in theories of fundamental interactions represents one of the central challenges in contemporary theoretical physics. Cold-atom platforms stand as promising candidates to realize quantum simulations of non-perturbative phenomena in gauge theories, such as vacuum decay and hadron collisions, in prohibitive conditions for direct experiments. In this work, we demonstrate that present-day quantum simulators can imitate linear particle accelerators, giving access to S-matrix measurements of elastic and inelastic meson collisions in low-dimensional abelian gauge theories. Considering for definiteness a (1 + 1)-dimensional Z(2)-lattice gauge theory realizable with Rydberg-atom arrays, we present protocols to observe and measure selected meson-meson scattering processes. We provide a benchmark theoretical study of scattering amplitudes in the regime of large fermion mass, including an exact solution valid for arbitrary coupling strength. This allows us to discuss the occurrence of inelastic scattering channels, featuring the production of new mesons with different internal structures. We present numerical simulations of realistic wavepacket collisions, which reproduce the predicted cross section peaks. This work highlights the potential of quantum simulations to give unprecedented access to real-time scattering dynamics.

TI Trade-off between information gain and disturbance in local
   discrimination of entangled quantum states
SO QUANTUM SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB We establish an information gain-disturbance trade-off relation in local state discrimination. Our result demonstrates a fundamental limitation of local strategy to discriminate entangled quantum states without disturbance, which becomes more difficult as the entanglement of the states to be discriminated increases. For a set of maximally entangled states (MESs), the capability of local strategy is tightly suppressed, as random guessing without measurements saturates the bound provided by the trade-off relation. We also show that the trade-off can be circumvented when local operations are aided by pre-shared entanglement. To simultaneously achieve correct guessing of state and non-disturbance, an entirely different strategy from conventional state discrimination should be adopted to lower the cost of pre-shared entanglement. We explicitly propose an adaptive and non-destructive strategy based on the stabilizer formalism, which shows a strict advantage over conventional teleportation-based approaches in pre-shared entanglement cost for discriminating a set of MESs. As an application of the trade-off relation, we propose an entanglement certification protocol that is robust against depolarizing noise and generalize it to multipartite scenarios in a quantum network.

TI Out-of-time-ordered correlators and the Loschmidt echo in the quantum
   kicked top: how low can we go?
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICS D-APPLIED PHYSICS
AB The out-of-time-ordered correlators (OTOCs) and the Loschmidt echo are two measures that are now widely being explored to characterize sensitivity to perturbations and information scrambling in complex quantum systems. Studying few qubits systems collectively modeled as a kicked top, we solve exactly the three- and four-qubit cases, giving analytical results for the OTOC and the Loschmidt echo. While we may not expect such few-body systems to display semiclassical features, we find that there are clear signatures of the exponential growth of OTOC even in systems with as low as four qubits in appropriate regimes, paving way for possible experimental measurements. We explain qualitatively how classical phase space structures like fixed points and periodic orbits have an influence on these quantities and how our results compare to the large-spin kicked top model. Finally we point to a peculiar case at the border of quantum-classical correspondence which is solvable for any number of qubits and yet has signatures of exponential sensitivity in a rudimentary form.

SO CHAOS SOLITONS & FRACTALS
AB Quantum droplets, stabilized by beyond-mean-field effects, represent a novel and intriguing state of matter in quantum many-body systems. While previous studies have focused primarily on dipolar and contact-interacting systems, quadrupolar condensates remain relatively unexplored. In this work, we explore the formation, structural properties, and dynamical behaviors of quantum droplets in a two-component quadrupolar Bose-Einstein condensate confined to a quasi-two-dimensional geometry. By incorporating quadrupole-quadrupole interactions (QQIs) and Lee-Huang-Yang (LHY) corrections into an extended Gross-Pitaevskii equation, we systematically study both ground-state and vortex-state droplets. Analytical results obtained via the Thomas-Fermi approximation predict flat-topped density profiles and linear scaling between effective area and particle number. These predictions are corroborated by numerical simulations, which also reveal the saturation of peak density and chemical potential at large norm. Furthermore, vortex quantum droplets exhibit anisotropic elliptical morphologies due to the directional nature of QQIs, with their aspect ratios significantly tunable by varying the particle number and quadrupolar interaction strength. Collision dynamics demonstrate rich behavior modulated by velocity and topology: ground-state droplets transition from inelastic merging to quasi-elastic scattering and quantum penetration, while vortex droplets exhibit phase-induced repulsion, fragmentation, and topologically protected tunneling. These findings offer a comprehensive understanding of how higher-order interactions and quantum fluctuations govern the formation and stability of quadrupolar droplets. This work lays a theoretical foundation for experimental realization and opens new directions for exploring anisotropic quantum fluids, topological excitations, and applications in quantum sensing and simulation.

TI Stable Unpaired Electron States in the Lu-Lu Bond Leading to the Absence
   of Odd-Even Parity in the Kondo Effect of Lu2@C82
   Transistors
SO NANO LETTERS
AB Spin qubits constructed in endohedral fullerenes benefit from the protective shielding of the carbon cage, which effectively mitigates external decoherence and enables ultralong coherence times. However, endohedral fullerene spin qubits face the challenge of charge transfer in complex electrical environments, such as during qubit readout or large-scale integration, which can induce spin state modifications. In this study, we developed transistors based on the endohedral fullerene Lu2@C82 and observed the absence of parity dependence in the Kondo effect; this result was contradictory to the typical behavior of the Kondo effect observed in C60. Density functional theory calculations revealed that upon electron loss, a spin-1/2 electron predominantly from the s-orbitals formed in the Lu-Lu bond and its orbital energy was significantly lower than that of the highest occupied molecular orbital. Based on these results, Lu2@C82 held stable unpaired electron states across multiple charge states and has potential applications in spin quantum devices.

TI Quantum-circuit refrigeration of a superconducting microwave resonator
   well below a single quantum
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB We experimentally demonstrate a recently proposed single-junction quantum-circuit refrigerator (QCR) as an in situ tunable low-temperature environment for a superconducting 4.7 GHz resonator. With the help of a transmon qubit, we measure the populations of the different resonator Fock states, thus providing reliable access to the temperature of the engineered electromagnetic environment and its effect on the resonator. We demonstrate coherent and thermal resonator states and that the on-demand dissipation provided by the QCR can drive these to a small fraction of a photon on average, even if starting above 1 K. We observe that the QCR can be operated either with a dc bias voltage or a gigahertz rf drive, or a combination of these. The bandwidth of the rf drive is not limited by the circuit itself and consequently, we show that 2.9 GHz continuous and 10 ns pulsed drives lead to identical desired refrigeration of the resonator. These observations answer to the shortcomings of previous works where the Fock states were not resolvable and the QCR exhibited slow charging dynamics. Thus, this work introduces a versatile tool to study open quantum systems, quantum thermodynamics, and to quickly reset superconducting qubits.

TI Achieving the Heisenberg limit with Dicke states in noisy quantum
   metrology
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Going beyond the standard quantum limit in noisy quantum metrology is an important and challenging task. Here we show how Dicke states can be used to surpass the standard quantum limit and achieve the Heisenberg limit in open quantum systems. The system we study has qubits symmetrically coupled to a resonator, and our objective is to estimate the coupling between the qubits and the resonator. The time -dependent quantum Fisher information with respect to the coupling is studied for this open quantum system where the same decay rates are assumed on all qubits. We show that when the system is initialized to a Dicke state with an optimal excitation number one can go beyond the standard quantum limit and achieve the Heisenberg limit even for finite values of the decays on the qubit and the resonator, particularly when the qubits and resonator are strongly coupled. We compare our results against the highly entangled GHZ state and a completely separable state and show that the GHZ state performs quite poorly, whereas under certain noise conditions the separable state is able to go beyond the standard quantum limit due to subsequent interactions with a resonator.

TI Thermal rectification through a nonlinear quantum resonator
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
AB We present a comprehensive and systematic study of thermal rectification in a prototypical low-dimensional quantum system-a nonlinear resonator: we identify necessary conditions to observe thermal rectification and we discuss strategies to maximize it. We focus, in particular, on the case where anharmonicity is very strong and the system reduces to a qubit. In the latter case, we derive general upper bounds on rectification which hold in the weak system-bath coupling regime, and we show how the Lamb shift can be exploited to enhance rectification. We then go beyond the weak-coupling regime by employing different methods: (i) including cotunneling processes, (ii) using the nonequilibrium Green's function formalism, and (iii) using the Feynman-Vernon path integral approach. We find that the strong coupling regime allows us to violate the bounds derived in the weak-coupling regime, providing us with clear signatures of high-order coherent processes visible in the thermal rectification. In the general case, where many levels participate to the system dynamics, we compare the heat rectification calculated with the equation of motion method and with a mean-field approximation. We find that the former method predicts, for a small or intermediate anharmonicity, a larger rectification coefficient.

TI Dephasing-assisted entanglement in a system of strongly coupled qubits
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB Creation of entangled states of quantum systems with low decoherence rates is a cornerstone in practical implementation of quantum computations. Processes of separate dephasing in each qubit in experimentally feasible systems is commonly accepted to destroy entanglement. In this work, we consider a system of two strongly coupled qubits that interact with dephasing reservoirs. We demonstrate that interaction with dephasing reservoirs can contribute to the formation of a long-lived mixed entangled state with nonzero concurrence. The weight of the subradiant state in this mixed state tends toward unity if the dephasing rate is much larger than the radiative rate and less than the coupling constant between qubits. The lifetime of this state is proportional to the exponent of the ratio of the coupling constant to environmental temperature and can be, by orders of magnitude, larger than the system's characteristic dephasing and dissipation times. Therefore, high dephasing, along with strong coupling, contributes to the creation of an entangled state with a long lifetime. This result paves the way for creation of long-lived entangled states.

TI V-LDAA: A New Lattice-Based Direct Anonymous Attestation Scheme for
   VANETs System
SO SECURITY AND COMMUNICATION NETWORKS
AB Privacy protection and message authentication issues in VANETs have received great attention in academia. Many authentication schemes in VANETs have been proposed, but most of them are based on classical difficult problems such as factorization in RSA setting or Elliptic Curve setting and are therefore not quantum resistant. If a quantum computer becomes available in the next few decades, the security of these schemes will be at stake. This paper presents a vehicular lattice-based direct anonymous attestation (V-LDAA) scheme adopting an optimized signature scheme based on automorphism stability which achieves postquantum security. A distributed pseudonym update and vehicle revocation mechanism based on the lattice is introduced in this paper, which means vehicles can update their pseudonyms and revoke the identity certificate by themselves without the need for pseudonym resolutions or CRLs checking. Compared with the existing lattice-based attestation schemes in VANETs, computation costs during signing and verification operations in V-LDAA are no longer related to the number of users, which makes it suitable for large-scale VANETs. Security analysis shows that V-LDAA resists TPM theft attacks and provides users with user-controlled anonymity, user-controlled unlinkability, and unforgeability against quantum adversaries. Experimental results show that V-LDAA reduces the blind signature size by 18%. The speed of blind signing is increased by 30%, and blind verification operation is accelerated 3 times compared with the existing lattice-based direct anonymous attestation (LDAA) scheme.

TI Perfect non-reciprocal reflection amplification in closed loop coherent
   gain atomic system
SO ACTA PHYSICA SINICA
AB High-performance non-reciprocal photonic devices can improve the efficiency of optical quantum manipulation, information processing, and quantum simulation effectively. The enhanced optical signal can simultaneously amplify the weak signal output by the quantum system and isolate the sensitive quantum system from the back-scattered external noise, which is the core technology of high-performance photonic devices. In our previous work (2023 Opt. Express 31 38228), we have achieved dynamic control of unidirectional reflection amplification based on four-wave mixing gain and the use of coupling field intensity varying linearly with position. In this work, we design a simple three-level closed loop coherent gain atomic system, setting the intensity of coupling field to be varying with position step shape to break the spatial symmetry of probe susceptibility, and achieving perfect non-reciprocal reflection light amplification. In contrast, the stepped variation of coupling field intensity is easier to adjust in experiment, greatly reducing the difficulty in the experiment. Specifically, the system introduces phase modulation. By changing the phase, the frequency region of probe gain and absorption can be switched, which makes the modulation of reflection amplification more flexible.

TI Long-range electron-electron interactions in quantum dot systems and
   applications in quantum chemistry
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Long-range interactions play a key role in several phenomena of quantum physics and chemistry. To study these phenomena, analog quantum simulators provide an appealing alternative to classical numerical methods. Gate-defined quantum dots have been established as a platform for quantum simulation, but for those experiments the effect of long-range interactions between the electrons did not play a crucial role. Here we present a detailed experimental characterization of long-range electron-electron interactions in an array of gate-defined semiconductor quantum dots. We demonstrate significant interaction strength among electrons that are separated by up to four sites, and show that our theoretical prediction of the screening effects matches well the experimental results. Based on these findings, we investigate how long-range interactions in quantum dot arrays may be utilized for analog simulations of artificial quantum matter. We numerically show that about ten quantum dots are sufficient to observe binding for a one-dimensional H-2-like molecule. These combined experimental and theoretical results pave the way for future quantum simulations with quantum dot arrays and benchmarks of numerical methods in quantum chemistry.

TI Quantum Chaos and the Spectrum of Factoring
SO ADVANCED QUANTUM TECHNOLOGIES
AB The factorization ensemble is a set to which integer factorable numbers N '=x ' y ', having the same trivial factorization complexity, belong. Hence, the Rivest-Shamir-Adleman (RSA) cryptographic moduli pertain to this set. A function E[x ',y '] can be defined therein which will be associated to the energy of a system of ions in a Penning trap. This is the quantum factoring simulator hypothesis connecting quantum mechanics with number theory. Here, a possible setup of the simulator from the magnetron energies of a Coulomb crystal in a cylindrical trap is described. Then, quantum mechanically, these energies may have only discrete values. To test the validity of the simulator hypothesis, evidence of this kind of discreteness from the statistics of the E[x ',y ']s of a large random sample of RSA moduli is reported; indeed, their unfolded distance probability distribution fits to a Gaussian Unitary Ensemble, exactly as required if they actually correspond to the quantum energy levels spacing of a magnetically confined system that exhibits chaos. The confirmation of these predictions is consistent with the quantum simulator hypothesis and, thereby, it points to the existence of a liaison between quantum mechanics and number theory.

TI Fabrication of Al/AlOx/Al junctions with high uniformity and
   stability on sapphire substrates
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB Tantalum and aluminum on sapphire are widely used platforms for qubits of long coherent time. As quantum chips scale up, the number of Josephson junctions on sapphire increases. Thus, both the uniformity and stability of the junctions are crucial to quantum devices, such as scalable superconducting quantum computer circuit, and quantum-limited amplifiers. By optimizing the fabrication process, especially, the conductive layer during the electron beam lithography process, Al/AlOx/Al junctions of sizes ranging from 0.0169 to 0.04 mu m(2) on sapphire substrates were prepared. The relative standard deviation of room temperature resistances (R-N)-sigma(RN)/< R-N > of these junctions is better than 1.7% on 15 mm x 15 mm chips, and better than 2.66% on 2 inch wafers, which is the highest uniformity on sapphire substrates has been reported. The junctions are robust and stable in resistances as temperature changes. The resistances increase by the ratio of 9.73% relative to R-N as the temperature ramp down to 4 K, and restore their initial values in the reverse process as the temperature ramps back to room temperature. After being stored in a nitrogen cabinet for 100 days, the resistance of the junctions changed by1.16% on average. The demonstration of uniform and stable Josephson junctions in large area paves the way for the fabrication of superconducting chip of hundreds of qubits on sapphire substrates.

TI Fast Quantum State Reconstruction via Accelerated Non-Convex Programming
SO PHOTONICS
AB We propose a new quantum state reconstruction method that combines ideas from compressed sensing, non-convex optimization, and acceleration methods. The algorithm, called Momentum-Inspired Factored Gradient Descent (MiFGD), extends the applicability of quantum tomography for larger systems. Despite being a non-convex method, MiFGD converges provably close to the true density matrix at an accelerated linear rate asymptotically in the absence of experimental and statistical noise, under common assumptions. With this manuscript, we present the method, prove its convergence property and provide the Frobenius norm bound guarantees with respect to the true density matrix. From a practical point of view, we benchmark the algorithm performance with respect to other existing methods, in both synthetic and real (noisy) experiments, performed on the IBM's quantum processing unit. We find that the proposed algorithm performs orders of magnitude faster than the state-of-the-art approaches, with similar or better accuracy. In both synthetic and real experiments, we observed accurate and robust reconstruction, despite the presence of experimental and statistical noise in the tomographic data. Finally, we provide a ready-to-use code for state tomography of multi-qubit systems.

TI High-Precision Mapping of Diamond Crystal Strain Using Quantum
   Interferometry
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW APPLIED
AB Crystal-strain variation imposes significant limitations on many quantum sensing and information applications for solid-state defect qubits in diamond. Thus, the precision measurement and control of diamond crystal strain is a key challenge. Here, we report diamond strain measurements with a unique set of capabilities, including micron-scale spatial resolution, a millimeter-scale field of view, and a 2-order-of-magnitude improvement in volume-normalized sensitivity over previous work, reach ,J ing 5(2) x 10(-8)/root Hz mu m(-3) (with spin-strain coupling coefficients representing the dominant systematic uncertainty). We use strain-sensitive spin-state interferometry on ensembles of nitrogen-vacancy (N-V) color centers in single-crystal bulk diamond with low strain gradients. This quantum interferometry technique provides insensitivity to magnetic-field inhomogeneity from the electronic and nuclear spin bath, thereby enabling long N-V-ensemble electronic spin dephasing times and enhanced strain sensitivity, as well as broadening the potential applications of the technique beyond isotopically enriched or high-purity diamond. We demonstrate the strain-sensitive measurement protocol first on a confocal scanning laser microscope, providing quantitative measurement of sensitivity as well as three-dimensional strain mapping; and second on a wide-field-imaging quantum diamond microscope. Our strain-microscopy technique enables fast, sensitive characterization for diamond material engineering and nanofabrication; as well as diamond-based sensing of strains applied externally, as in diamond anvil cells or embedded diamond stress sensors, or internally, as by crystal damage due to particle-induced nuclear recoils.

TI Optimal bi-planar gradient coil configurations for diamond
   nitrogen-vacancy based diffusion-weighted NMR experiments
SO MAGNETIC RESONANCE MATERIALS IN PHYSICS BIOLOGY AND MEDICINE
AB Introduction Diffusion weighting in optically detected magnetic resonance experiments involving diamond nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers can provide valuable microstructural information. Bi-planar gradient coils employed for diffusion weighting afford excellent spatial access, essential for integrating the NV-NMR components. Nevertheless, owing to the polar tilt of roughly 55(?) of the diamond NV center, the primary magnetic field direction must be taken into account accordingly.Methods To determine the most effective bi-planar gradient coil configurations, we conducted an investigation into the impact of various factors, including the square side length, surface separation, and surface orientation. This was accomplished by generating over 500 bi-planar surface configurations using automated methods. Results We successfully generated and evaluated coil layouts in terms of sensitivity and field accuracy. Interestingly, inclined bi-planar orientations close to the NV-NMR setup's requirement, showed higher sensitivity for the transverse gradient chan-nels than horizontal or vertical orientations. We fabricated a suitable solution as a three-channel bi-planar double-layered PCB system and experimentally validated the sensitivities at 28.7mT/m/A and 26.8mT/m/A for the transverse G(X) and G(y) gradients, and 26mT/m/A for the G(z) gradient.Discussion We found that the chosen relative bi-planar tilt of 35? represents a reasonable compromise in terms of overall performance and allows for easier coil implementation with a straight, horizontal alignment within the overall experimental setup.

TI Quantum microwave electric field measurement technology based on
   enhancement electric filed resonator
SO ACTA PHYSICA SINICA
AB Rydberg atoms based quantum microwave measurement technology has significant advantages such as self -calibration, traceability, high sensitivity and stable uniformity of measurement. In this work, from the dimension of traditional electromagnetic theory, an electric field local enhancement technique for quantum microwave measurements is developed to improve the sensitivity of quantum microwave receiver. The theoretical basis of this method comes from the different mechanisms of realization of microwave reception in quantum microwave receivers and classical receiver. Classic receivers use antennas to collect microwave energy in space to signal reception; quantum microwave receivers measure the strength of the electric field in the path of a laser beam in an atomic gas chamber (the beam is about 100 mu m in diameter) to realize the signal reception. Therefore, the sensitivity of quantum microwave receiver can be improved by increasing the electric field strength in the path of laser beam. The critical physical mechanism is the multi-beam interference at the open end and the short-circuited end of the structure. The results show that with the decrease of gap height of parallel plates, the enhancement factor of electric field strength increases rapidly and the power density compression capability is greatly improved. The |69D5/2 ⟩ experiments verify that the structure can achieve a 25 dB electric field enhancement at 2.1 GHz. This research is expected to be helpful in improving the sensitivity of measurement based on atomic measurement capabilities and in promoting the practical development of quantum microwave measurement technology.

TI Classical and Quantum Physical Reservoir Computing for Onboard
   Artificial Intelligence Systems: A Perspective
SO DYNAMICS
AB Artificial intelligence (AI) systems of autonomous systems such as drones, robots and self-driving cars may consume up to 50% of the total power available onboard, thereby limiting the vehicle's range of functions and considerably reducing the distance the vehicle can travel on a single charge. Next-generation onboard AI systems need an even higher power since they collect and process even larger amounts of data in real time. This problem cannot be solved using traditional computing devices since they become more and more power-consuming. In this review article, we discuss the perspectives on the development of onboard neuromorphic computers that mimic the operation of a biological brain using the nonlinear-dynamical properties of natural physical environments surrounding autonomous vehicles. Previous research also demonstrated that quantum neuromorphic processors (QNPs) can conduct computations with the efficiency of a standard computer while consuming less than 1% of the onboard battery power. Since QNPs are a semi-classical technology, their technical simplicity and low cost compared to quantum computers make them ideally suited for applications in autonomous AI systems. Providing a perspective on the future progress in unconventional physical reservoir computing and surveying the outcomes of more than 200 interdisciplinary research works, this article will be of interest to a broad readership, including both students and experts in the fields of physics, engineering, quantum technologies and computing.

TI Remotely preparing optical Schrodinger cat states via homodyne detection
   in nondegenerate triple-photon spontaneous downconversion
SO QUANTUM SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB Optical downconversion is a key resource for generating nonclassical states. Very recently, direct nondegenerate triple-photon spontaneous downconversion (NTPSD) with bright photon triplets and strong third-order correlations has been demonstrated in a superconducting device (2020 Phys. Rev. X 10 011011). Besides, linear and nonlinear tripartite entanglement in this process have also been predicted (2018 Phys. Rev. Lett. 120 043601; 2020 Phys. Rev. Lett. 125 020502). In this paper, we consider the generation of nonclassical optical quantum superpositions and investigate nonlinear quantum steering effects in NTPSD. We find that large-size Schrodinger cat states of one downconverted mode can be achieved when the other two modes are subjected to homodyne detection. Also, a two-photon Bell entangled state can be generated when only one mode is homodyned. We further reveal that such ability of remote state steering originates from nonlinear quantum steerable correlations among the triplets. This is specifically embodied by the seeming violation of the Heisenberg uncertainty relation for the inferred variances of two noncommutating higher-order quadratures of downconverted modes, based on the outcomes of homodyne detection on the other mode, i.e., nonlinear quantum steering, compared to original Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen steering. Our results demonstrate non-Gaussian nonclassical features in NTPSD and would be useful for the fundamental tests of quantum physics and implementations of optical quantum technologies.

TI Hardware-Efficient Quantum Phase Estimation via Local Control
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB Quantum phase estimation plays a central role in quantum simulation as it enables the study of spectral properties of many-body quantum systems. Most variants of the phase estimation algorithm require the application of the global unitary evolution conditioned on the state of one or more auxiliary qubits, posing a significant challenge for current quantum devices. In this work, we present an approach to quantum phase estimation that uses only locally controlled operations, resulting in a significantly reduced circuit depth. At the heart of our approach are efficient routines to measure the complex phase of the expectation value of the time-evolution operator, the so-called Loschmidt echo, for both circuit dynamics and Hamiltonian dynamics. By tracking changes in the phase during the dynamics, the routines trade circuit depth for increased sampling cost and classical postprocessing. Our approach does not rely on reference states and is applicable to any efficiently preparable state, regardless of its correlations. We provide a comprehensive analysis of the sample complexity and illustrate the results with numerical simulations. Our methods offer a practical pathway for measuring spectral properties in large many-body quantum systems using current quantum devices.

TI Inferring interpretable dynamical generators of local quantum
   observables from projective measurements through machine learning
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW APPLIED
AB To characterize the dynamical behavior of many-body quantum systems, one is usually interested in the evolution of so-called order parameters rather than in characterizing the full quantum state. In many situations, these quantities coincide with the expectation value of local observables, such as the magnetization or the particle density. In experiment, however, these expectation values can only be obtained with a finite degree of accuracy due to the effects of the projection noise. Here, we utilize a machine-learning approach to infer the dynamical generator governing the evolution of local observables in a many-body system from noisy data. To benchmark our method, we consider a variant of the quantum Ising model and generate synthetic experimental data, containing the results of N projective measurements at M sampling points in time, using the time-evolving block-decimation algorithm. As we show, across a wide range of parameters the dynamical generator of local observables can be approximated by a Markovian quantum master equation. Our method is not only useful for extracting effective dynamical generators from manybody systems but may also be applied for inferring decoherence mechanisms of quantum simulation and computing platforms.

TI Speedup of the quantum adiabatic algorithm using delocalization
   catalysis
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB We propose a method to speed up the quantum adiabatic algorithm using catalysis by many-body delocalization. This is applied to random-field antiferromagnetic Ising spin models. The algorithm is catalyzed in such a way that the evolution approximates a Heisenberg model in the middle of its course, and the model is in a delocalized phase. We show numerically that we can speed up the standard algorithm for finding the ground state of the random-field Ising model using this idea. We also demonstrate that the speedup is due to gap amplification, even though the underlying model is not frustration-free. The crossover to speedup occurs at roughly the value of the interaction which is known to be the critical one for the delocalization transition. We also calculate the participation ratio and entanglement entropy as a function of time: Their time dependencies indicate that the system is exploring more states and that they are more entangled than when there is no catalyst. Together, all these pieces of evidence demonstrate that the speedup is related to delocalization. Even though only relatively small systems can be investigated, the evidence suggests that the scaling of the method with system size is favorable. Our method is illustrated by experimental results from a small online IBM quantum computer, showing how to verify the method in future as such machines improve. The cost of the catalytic method compared with the standard algorithm is only a constant factor.

TI A magnon scattering platform
SO PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF
   AMERICA
AB Scattering experiments have revolutionized our understanding of nature. Examples include the discovery of the nucleus [R. G. Newton, Scattering Theory of Waves and Particles (1982)], crystallography [U. Pietsch, V. HolATIN SMALL LETTER Y WITH ACUTE, T. Baumback, High-Resolution X-Ray Scattering (2004)], and the discovery of the double-helix structure of DNA [J. D. Watson, F. H. C. Crick, Nature 171, 737-738]. Scattering techniques differ by the type of particles used, the interaction these particles have with target materials, and the range of wavelengths used. Here, we demonstrate a two-dimensional table-top scattering platform for exploring magnetic properties of materials on mesoscopic length scales. Long-lived, coherent magnonic excitations are generated in a thin film of yttrium iron garnet and scattered off a magnetic target deposited on its surface. The scattered waves are then recorded using a scanning nitrogen vacancy center magnetometer that allows subwavelength imaging and operation under conditions ranging from cryogenic to ambient environment. While most scattering platforms measure only the intensity of the scattered waves, our imaging method allows for spatial determination of both amplitude and phase of the scattered waves, thereby allowing for a systematic reconstruction of the target scattering potential. Our experimental results are consistent with theoretical predictions for such a geometry and reveal several unusual features of the magnetic response of the target, including suppression near the target edges and a gradient in the direction perpendicular to the direction of surface wave propagation. Our results establish magnon scattering experiments as a platform for studying correlated many-body systems.

TI Breaking the rate-distance limitation of measurement-device-independent
   quantum secret sharing
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Currently most progress on quantum secret sharing suffers from rate-distance bound, and thus the key rates are limited. In addition to the limited key rate, the technical difficulty and the corresponding cost together prevent large-scale deployment. Furthermore, the performance of most existing protocols is analyzed in the asymptotic regime without considering participant attacks. Here we report a measurement-device-independent quantum secret-sharing protocol with improved key rate and transmission distance. Based on spatial multiplexing, our protocol shows it can break rate-distance bounds over network under at least ten communication parties. Compared with other protocols, our work improves the secret key rate by more than two orders of magnitude and has a longer transmission distance. We analyze the security of our protocol in the composable framework considering participant attacks and evaluate its performance in the finite-size regime. In addition, we investigate applying our protocol to digital signatures where the signature rate is improved more than 107 times compared with existing protocols. We anticipate that our quantum secret-sharing protocol will provide a solid future for multiparty applications on the quantum network.

TI Eavesdropper localization for quantum and classical channels via
   nonlinear scattering
SO OPTICA QUANTUM
AB Optical fiber networks are part of the important critical infrastructure and known to be prone to eavesdropping attacks. Hence, cryptographic methods have to be used to protect communication. Quantum key distribution (QKD), at its core, offers information theoretical security based on the laws of physics. In deployments, one has to take into account practical security and resilience. The latter includes the localization of a possible eavesdropper after an anomaly has been detected by the QKD system to avoid denial-of-service. Here, we present an approach to eavesdropper location that can be employed in quantum as well as classical channels using stimulated Brillouin scattering. The tight localization of the acoustic wave inside the fiber channel using correlated pump and probe waves allows discovery of the coordinates of a potential threat within centimeters. We demonstrate that our approach outperforms conventional optical time-domain reflectometry (OTDR) in the task of localizing an evanescent outcoupling of 1 % with centimeter precision inside standard optical fibers. The system is furthermore able to clearly distinguish commercially available standard SMF28 from different manufacturers, paving the way for fingerprinted fibers in high-security environments.

TI Transmission estimation at the quantum Cramer-Rao bound with macroscopic
   quantum light
SO EPJ QUANTUM TECHNOLOGY
AB The field of quantum metrology seeks to apply quantum techniques and/or resources to classical sensing approaches with the goal of enhancing the precision in the estimation of a parameter beyond what can be achieved with classical resources. Theoretically, the fundamental minimum uncertainty in the estimation of a parameter for a given probing state is bounded by the quantum Cramer-Rao bound. From a practical perspective, it is necessary to find physical measurements that can saturate this fundamental limit and to show experimentally that it is possible to perform measurements with the required precision to do so. Here we perform experiments that saturate the quantum Cramer-Rao bound for transmission estimation over a wide range of transmissions when probing the system under study with a continuous wave bright two-mode squeezed state. To properly take into account the imperfections in the generation of the quantum state, we extend our previous theoretical results to incorporate the measured properties of the generated quantum state. For our largest transmission level of 84%, we show a 62% reduction over the optimal classical protocol in the variance in transmission estimation when probing with a bright two-mode squeezed state with -8 dB of intensity-difference squeezing. Given that transmission estimation is an integral part of many sensing protocols, such as plasmonic sensing, spectroscopy, calibration of the quantum efficiency of detectors, etc., the results presented promise to have a significant impact on a number of applications in various fields of research.

TI A New Quantum Multiparty Simultaneous Identity Authentication Protocol
   with the Classical Third-Party
SO ENTROPY
AB To guarantee information security in communication, quantum identity authentication plays a key role in politics, economy, finance, daily life and other fields. In this paper, a new quantum multiparty simultaneous identity authentication protocol with Greenberger-Home-Zeilinger (GHZ) state is presented. In this protocol, the authenticator and the certified parties are the participants with quantum ability, whereas the third party is a classical participant. Here, the third-party is honest and the other two parties may be dishonest. With the help of a classical third-party, a quantum authenticator and the multiple certified parties can implement two-way identity authentication at the same time. It reduces the quantum burden of participants and lowers down the trustworthiness, which makes the protocol be feasible in practice. Through further security analysis, the protocol can effectively prevent an illegal dishonest participant from obtaining a legitimate identity. It shows that the protocol is against impersonation attack, intercept-measure-resend attack and entangle-measure attack, etc. In all, the paper provides positive efforts for the subsequent security identity authentication in quantum network.

TI Fiber-taper collected emission from NV centers in high-Q/V diamond
   microdisks
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB Fiber -coupled microdisks are a promising platform for enhancing the spontaneous emission from color centers in diamond. The measured cavity -enhanced emission from the microdisk is governed by the effective volume (V) of each cavity mode, the cavity quality factor (Q), and the coupling between the microdisk and the fiber. Here we observe room temperature photoluminescence from an ensemble of nitrogen -vacancy centers into high Q/V microdisk modes, which when combined with coherent spectroscopy of the microdisk modes, allows us to elucidate the relative contributions of these factors. The broad emission spectrum acts as an internal light source facilitating mode identification over several cavity free spectral ranges. Analysis of the fiber taper collected microdisk emission reveals spectral filtering both by the cavity and the fiber taper, the latter of which we find preferentially couples to higher -order microdisk modes. Coherent mode spectroscopy is used to measure Q - 1 x 105 - the highest reported values for diamond microcavities operating at visible wavelengths. With realistic optimization of the microdisk dimensions, we predict that Purcell factors of -50 are within reach.

TI Controlling the spontaneous emission of the telecom O-band centers in
   Silicon-on-Insulator with coherent dipole-quadrupole interactions on a
   silicon pillar lattice
SO JOURNAL OF LUMINESCENCE
AB The G-center in silicon-on-insulator (SOI) has emerged as a relevant single photon source due to the zero-phonon line at 1278 nm, matching the O-band of optical telecommunication wavelengths. Due to the weak emission of the G-center from planar SOI, it is necessary to enhance its emission, in terms of collection efficiency and fluorescence enhancement, to further study its optical properties for application in quantum technologies. Here we design a fabrication-ready SOI Mie-resonator made of a lattice of silicon nanopillars on silica to achieve the spontaneous emission enhancement of single G-centers. Using Si nanopillars lattice on silica with period and dimensions optimized, owing to the coherent superposition of the electric dipolar and magnetic quadrupolar electromagnetic Mie-scattering moments of the individual pillars to the periodic lattice, we show the G-center emission/decay rate enhancement averaged over it's possible dipole orientations is about 13 times compared to bulk. This corresponds to a fluorescence enhancement of about 125 times compared to bulk and about 5-6 times compared to an optimized single pillar with photon collection with a confocal objective. These results provide a fabrication pathway for out-of-plane single photon collection from the SOI G-center or other telecom O-band single-photon sources for their potential deployment in CMOS-compatible quantum optical technologies.

TI Active control of mid-wavelength infrared non-linearity in silicon
   photonic crystal slab
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB Natural materials' inherently weak nonlinear response demands the design of artificial substitutes to avoid optically large samples and complex phase-matching techniques. Silicon photonic crystals are promising artificial materials for this quest. Their nonlinear properties can be modulated optically, paving the way for applications ranging from ultrafast information processing to quantum technologies. A two-dimensional 15- mu m-thick silicon photonic structure, comprising a hexagonal array of air holes traversing the slab's thickness, has been designed to support a guided resonance for the light with a wavelength of 4-mu m. At the resonance conditions, a transverse mode of the light is strongly confined between the holes in the "veins" of the silicon component. Owing to the confinement, the structure exhibits a ratio of nonlinear to linear absorption coefficients threefold higher than the uniform silicon slab of the same thickness. A customised time-resolved Z-scan method with provisions to accommodate ultrafast pump-probe measurements was used to investigate and quantify the non-linear response. We show that optically pumping free charge carriers into the structure decouples the incoming light from the resonance and reduces the non-linear response. The time-resolved measurements suggest that the decoupling is a relatively long-lived effect on the scale comparable to the non-radiative recombination in the bulk material. Moreover, we demonstrate that the excited free carriers are not the source of the nonlinearity, as this property is determined by the structure design.

TI Extending the planar theory of anyons to quantum wire networks
SO SCIPOST PHYSICS
AB The braiding of the worldlines of particles restricted to move on a network (graph) is governed by the graph braid group, which can be strikingly different from the standard braid group known from two-dimensional physics. It has been recently shown that imposing the compatibility of graph braiding with anyon fusion for anyons exchanging at a single wire junction leads to new types of anyon models with the braiding exchange operators stemming from solutions of certain generalised hexagon equations. In this work, we establish these graph-braided anyon fusion models for general wire networks. We show that the character of braiding strongly depends on the graph-theoretic connectivity of the given network. In particular, we prove that triconnected networks yield the same braiding exchange operators as the planar anyon models. In contrast, modular biconnected networks support independent braiding exchange operators in different modules. Consequently, such modular networks may lead to more efficient topological quantum computer circuits. Finally, we conjecture that the graph-braided anyon fusion models will possess the (generalised) coherence property where certain polygon equations determine the braiding exchange operators for an arbitrary number of anyons. We also extensively study solutions to these polygon equations for chosen low-rank multiplicity-free fusion rings, including the Ising theory, quantum double of Z2, and Tambara-Yamagami models. We find numerous solutions that do not appear in the planar theory of anyons.

TI Photon-Assisted Quantum Phase Transitions in a Cavity Optomechanical
   System with Two Nonlinear Mechanical Modes
SO ANNALEN DER PHYSIK
AB Photon-assisted quantum phase transitions (QPTs) are studied in a cavity optomechanical system that consists of one optical cavity and two nonlinear mechanical resonators and explore ground-state properties of quantum phases. It is indicated that the cavity mode can induce effective two-phonon tunneling interaction between two mechanical resonators. It is found that QPTs between the localization phase (LP) and delocalization phase (DP) of phonons can happen through tuning the phonon tunneling interaction. It is shown that the photon-assisted QPT is the second order QPT. Ground-state properties of the quantum phases are also investigated. It is indicated that the ground state of the LP is a separable squeezed state while the ground state of the DP is an entangled state. The results open a new way to engineer quantum phases and QPTs in macroscopic mechanical systems and can benefit a wide range of criticality-enhanced quantum sensing applications.

TI Depth profiling of microwave nitrogen-terminated polycrystalline diamond
   surfaces by energy-dependent X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy
SO APPLIED SURFACE SCIENCE
AB Nitrogen-terminated diamonds hold promise for stabilizing near-surface NV - centers, which is essential for reliable quantum sensing. Among various surface preparation methods, microwave (MW) nitrogen plasma, known for its minimal surface damage, appears as the most effective choice. In this investigation, we explore the nature of nitrogen bonding of polycrystalline diamond (PCD) surfaces exposed to MW nitrogen plasma using Xray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS) depth profiling and Near-Edge X-ray Absorption Fine Structure (NEXAFS) spectroscopy at the C K - and N K -edges. XPS depth profiling with atomic resolution, achieved by varying the probing photon energy using synchrotron radiation and supported by a physical model considering the associated inelastic mean free path, suggests a surface of almost fully saturated nitrogen in two main bonding configurations of similar contribution and a low coverage of similar to 5 % of graphene-like islands residing atop the nitrogen-terminated diamond surface. The thermal stability of these surface groups is monitored by in situ annealing up to 700 degrees C. The depth profiles reveal that nitrogen atoms do not diffuse in the diamond crystal, resulting in excellent diamond crystallinity in the first atomic planes below the surface. C K -edge NEXAFS analysis reveals the position of unoccupied surface states within the diamond bandgap, opening new perspective on the stabilization of near-surface NV - centers.

TI Super-Operator Linear Equations and Their Applications to Quantum
   Antennas and Quantum Light Scattering
SO APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL
AB In this paper, we develop a resolvent method for super-operator equations with applications in quantum optics. Our approach is based on the novel concept of a linear super-operator acting on the Hilbert subspace of vector or scalar linear operators satisfying physically reasonable commutation relations. The super-operator equations for the electromagnetic (EM) field operators are formulated for the problems of quantum antenna emission and quantum light scattering by a dielectric body. The general solution of super-operator equation is presented in terms of the classical resolvent. In contrast to the classical case, it includes the ancillary components associated with the quantum noise even in the absence of absorption. The reason for this lies in the energy exchange between different spatial regions with various bases for the field presentation (which looks like losses or gain from the point of view of the correspondent region). A number of examples (a two-element dipole antenna, a plane dielectric layer, and a dielectric cylinder with a circular cross section) which demonstrate the physical mechanism of the appearance of noise are considered. It is shown that antenna emission or scattering transforms the coherent properties of quantum light. This leads to a new way of controlling coherence in a direction-dependent manner, a feature that can be useful in various applications of quantum technologies, including quantum radars and lidars, and quantum antennas.

TI Timestamp boson sampling
SO APPLIED PHYSICS REVIEWS
AB Quantum advantage, benchmarking the computational power of quantum machines outperforming all classical computers in a specific task, represents a crucial milestone in developing quantum computers and has been driving different physical implementations since the concept was proposed. A boson sampling machine, an analog quantum computer that only requires multiphoton interference and single-photon detection, is considered to be a promising candidate to reach this goal. However, the probabilistic nature of photon sources and the inevitable loss in evolution network make the execution time exponentially increasing with the problem size. Here, we propose and experimentally demonstrate a timestamp boson sampling scheme that can effectively reduce the execution time for any problem size. By developing a time-of-flight storage technique with a precision up to picosecond level, we are able to detect and record the complete time information of 30 individual modes out of a large-scale 3D photonic chip. We perform the three-photon injection and one external trigger experiment to demonstrate that the timestamp protocol works properly and effectively reduce the execution time. We further verify that timestamp boson sampler is distinguished from other samplers in the case of limited datasets through the three heralded single photons injection experiment. The timestamp protocol can speed up the sampling process, which can be widely applied in multiphoton experiments at low-sampling rate. The approach associated with newly exploited resource from time information can boost all the count-rate-limited experiments, suggesting an emerging field of timestamp quantum optics.

TI Calculating transition amplitudes by variational quantum deflation
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) is an appealing candidate for the application of near-term quantum computers. A technique introduced in [Higgot et al., Quantum 3, 156 (2019)], which is named variational quantum deflation (VQD), has extended the ability of the VQE framework for finding excited states of a Hamiltonian. However, no method to evaluate transition amplitudes between the eigenstates found by the VQD without using any costly Hadamard-test-like circuit has been proposed despite its importance for computing properties of the system such as electronic oscillator strengths of molecules. Here we propose a method to evaluate transition amplitudes between the eigenstates obtained by the VQD avoiding any Hadamard-test-like circuit. Our method relies only on the ability to estimate overlap between two states, so it does not restrict to the VQD eigenstates and applies for general situations. To support the significance of our method, we provide a comparison of three previously proposed methods to find excited states with numerical simulation of three molecules (lithium hydride, diazene, and azobenzene) and find that the VQD method exhibits the best performance among the three methods within the scope of noiseless simulation. Finally, we demonstrate the validity of our method by calculating the oscillator strength of lithium hydride, comparing results from numerical simulations and real-hardware experiments on the cloud enabled quantum computer IBMQ Rome. Our results illustrate the superiority of the VQD to find excited states and widen its applicability to various quantum systems.

TI Representation theory of coherent photons and application to CNOT
   operation for spin and orbital angular momentum
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB Coherent photons have both spin and orbital angular momentum, and the superposition state among orthogonal states can describe a qubit. Here, we show the internal structure of coherent photons with spin and orbital angular momentum can be described by a representation theory of Lie algebra and Lie group. As an application of this theory, we have experimentally demonstrated the controlled-NOT (CNOT) operation, using a standard green laser diode. We have used beam splitters and waveplates to generate the macroscopic entangled light source with amplitudes and phases, controlled by rotating the waveplates. By applying the Bell projection to the entangled light, the far-field image of the light shows an expected dipole shape in the superposition state of left and right vortices, allowing to identify the state from the image. Then, we have used a polarisation dependent beam splitter to split the spin state, and we applied a NOT operation, made of a pair of cylindrical lenses, only for a vortex with a chosen polarisation, and recombined the beams after the operation. The proposed architecture could be used for a platform to manipulate qubits, made of macroscopically coherent photons.

TI Critical unstable qubits: An application to the
   B0B0 meson system
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW D
AB We extend our previous work on a novel class of unstable qubits which we have identified recently and called them critical unstable qubits (CUQs). The characteristic property of CUQs is that the energylevel and decay-width vectors, E and Gamma, are orthogonal to one another, and the key parameter r 1/4 Gamma / 2E is less than 1. Most remarkably, CUQs exhibit two atypical behaviors: (i) they display coherence-decoherence oscillations in a co-decaying frame of the system described by a unit Bloch vector b, and (ii) the unit Bloch vector b describing a pure CUQ sweeps out unequal areas during equal intervals of time, while rotating about the vector E. The latter anharmonic phenomenon emerges beyond the usual oscillatory pattern due to the energy-level difference of the two-level quantum system, which governs an ordinary qubit. By making use of a Fourier series decomposition, we define anharmonicity observables that quantify the degree of nonsinusoidal oscillation of a CUQ. We apply the results of our formalism to the B0 B<overline>0-meson system and derive, for the first time, generic upper limits on these new observables.

TI Performance of Spectrophotometric and Fluorometric DNA Quantification
   Methods
SO ANALYTICA
AB Accurate DNA quantification is a highly important method within molecular biology. Methods widely used to quantify DNA are UV spectrometry and fluorometry. In this research, seven different DNA samples and one blank (MilliQ ultrapure water) were quantified by three analysts using one spectrophotometric (i.e., a NanoDrop instrument) and three fluorometric (i.e., the AccuGreen High Sensitivity kit, the AccuClear Ultra High Sensitivity kit, and the Qubit dsDNA HS Assay kit) methods. An analysis of variance (ANOVA) scheme was used to determine the influence of the analyst, the method, and the combination of analyst and method, on DNA quantification. For most samples, the measured DNA concentration was close to or slightly above the concentration of 10 ng/mu L as specified by the supplier. Results obtained by the three analysts were equal. However, it was found that, compared to the fluorometric kits, the used spectrophotometric instrument in the case of fish DNA samples tends to overestimate the DNA concentration. Therefore, if sufficient sample volume is available, a combination of a spectrophotometric and a fluorometric method is recommended for obtaining data on the purity and the dsDNA concentration of a sample.

TI Design of Linkable Ring Signature Scheme Based on the MP-LWE Problem and
   Its Application in IoV
SO IET INFORMATION SECURITY
AB Ensuring the information security and privacy of users in the Internet of Vehicles (IoV) is crucial for gaining user trust and promoting the application of vehicular networks. This article designs an efficient linkable ring signature (LRS) scheme on the basis of the middle-product learning with errors (MP-LWE) problem and applies it to vehicular networks to resist quantum computer attacks. First, a new authentication scheme based on the MP-LWE problem is proposed. In addition, it is demonstrated to be compatible with the DualRing framework. Then, according to the transformation of DualRing, a new efficient ring signature scheme based on the MP-LWE problem is obtained. With anti-collision hash functions to assign a specific tag to each user, this ring signature scheme is converted into a secure LRS scheme. Subsequently, under the random oracle model, the unforgeability, anonymity, and linkability of the LRS scheme are shown. Furthermore, by integrating the scheme constructed in this article with blockchain technology and applying it to IoV scenarios, it effectively ensures the privacy of vehicle identities during communication and the reliability of messages and significantly improves communication efficiency. The signature length of the LRS scheme designed in the present study is 4-20 times shorter than that of similar schemes. Regarding time overhead, the total time overhead of our scheme can be reduced by 14.72%-40.38%.

TI Non-Markovianity in collision models with initial intra-environment
   correlations
SO NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB Collision models (CMs) describe an open system interacting in sequence with elements of an environment, termed ancillas. They have been established as a useful tool for analyzing non-Markovian open quantum dynamics based on the ability to control the environmental memory through simple feedback mechanisms. In this work, we investigate how ancilla-ancilla (AA) entanglement can serve as a mechanism for controlling the non-Markovianity of an open system, focusing on an operational approach to generating correlations within the environment. To this end, we first demonstrate that the open dynamics of CMs with sequentially generated correlations between groups of ancillas can be mapped onto a composite CM, where the memory part of the environment is incorporated into an enlarged Markovian system. We then apply this framework to an all-qubit CM, and show that non-Markovian behavior emerges only when the next incoming pair of ancillas are entangled prior to colliding with the system. On the other hand, when system-ancilla collisions precede AA entanglement, we find the open dynamics to always be Markovian. Our findings highlight how certain qualitative features of inter-ancilla correlations can strongly influence the onset of system non-Markovianity.

TI Gradient-Descent Quantum Process Tomography by Learning Kraus Operators
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB We perform quantum process tomography (QPT) for both discrete-and continuous-variable quantum systems by learning a process representation using Kraus operators. The Kraus form ensures that the reconstructed process is completely positive. To make the process trace preserving, we use a constrained gradient-descent (GD) approach on the so-called Stiefel manifold during optimization to obtain the Kraus operators. Our ansatz uses a few Kraus operators to avoid direct estimation of large process matrices, e.g., the Choi matrix, for low-rank quantum processes. The GD-QPT matches the performance of both compressed-sensing (CS) and projected least-squares (PLS) QPT in benchmarks with two-qubit random processes, but shines by combining the best features of these two methods. Similar to CS (but unlike PLS), GD-QPT can reconstruct a process from just a small number of random measurements, and similar to PLS (but unlike CS) it also works for larger system sizes, up to at least five qubits. We envisage that the data -driven approach of GD-QPT can become a practical tool that greatly reduces the cost and computational effort for QPT in intermediate-scale quantum systems.

SO ENTROPY
AB Entanglement swapping is gaining widespread attention due to its application in entanglement distribution among different parts of quantum appliances. We investigate the entanglement swapping for pure and noisy systems, and argue different entanglement quantifiers for quantum states. We explore the relationship between the entanglement of initial states and the average entanglement of final states in terms of concurrence and negativity. We find that if initial quantum states are maximally entangled and we make measurements in the Bell basis, then average concurrence and average negativity of final states give similar results. In this case, we simply obtain the average concurrence (average negativity) of the final states by taking the product of concurrences (negativities) of the initial states. However, the measurement in non-maximally entangled basis during entanglement swapping degrades the average swapped entanglement. Further, the product of the entanglement of the initial mixed states provides an upper bound to the average swapped entanglement of final states obtained after entanglement swapping. The negativity work well for weak entangled noisy states but concurrence gives better results for relatively strong entanglement regimes. We also discuss how successfully the output state can be used as a channel for the teleportation of an unknown qubit.

TI Abrupt energy flipping in a continuously observed Rabi driven quantum
   bit
SO RESULTS IN PHYSICS
AB In the presence of a periodic external drive, the mean value of the energy of a two-level quantum system (or qubit) displays the well-known Rabi oscillatory dynamics that is usually described within the rotating wave approximation. In order to calculate its standard deviation, we get rid of this latter and obtain a huge ratio (of order unity) of standard deviation over mean value. This is due to the large-amplitude high-frequency oscillations of the internal as well as of the overall phase of the two-level system. In presence of continuous measurement of, say, the ground state energy that yields the quantum Zeno effect, the system remains frozen in its ground state as long as the dynamics of the driven system allows its energy to stay within its Rabi standard deviation. When reaching the boundary, the energy suddenly flips over to the excited level in order to stay further within its standard deviation. We model this energy flip by use of parametrized quantum transitions and show that it can be defined as the result of action quantization. We check our theory by recovering the so-called "quantum jumps" published by Minev et al. (2019).

TI Two-level systems coupled to Graphene plasmons: A Lindblad equation
   approach
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MODERN PHYSICS B
AB In this paper, we review the theory of open quantum systems and macroscopic quantum electrodynamics, providing a self-contained account of many aspects of these two theories. The former is presented in the context of a qubit coupled to a electromagnetic thermal bath, the latter is presented in the context of a quantization scheme for surface-plasmon polaritons (SPPs) in graphene based on Langevin noise currents. This includes a calculation of the dyadic Green's function (in the electrostatic limit) for a Graphene sheet between two semi-infinite linear dielectric media, and its subsequent application to the construction of SPP creation and annihilation operators. We then bring the two fields together and discuss the entanglement of two qubits in the vicinity of a graphene sheet which supports SPPs. The two qubits communicate with each other via the emission and absorption of SPPs. We find that a Schrodinger cat state involving the two qubits can be partially protected from decoherence by taking advantage of the dissipative dynamics in graphene. A comparison is also drawn between the dynamics at zero temperature, obtained via Schrodinger's equation, and at finite temperature, obtained using the Lindblad equation.

TI Driven dynamics of a quantum dot electron spin coupled to a bath of
   higher-spin nuclei
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
AB The interplay of optical driving and hyperfine interactions between an electron confined in a quantum dot and its surrounding nuclear spin environment produces a range of interesting physics stemming from the creation of dynamic nuclear polarization. In this paper, we go beyond the ubiquitous spin-1/2 approximation for nuclear spins and present a comprehensive theoretical framework for an optically driven electron spin in a self-assembled quantum dot coupled to a nuclear spin bath of arbitrary spin. Using a dynamical mean-field approach, we compute the nuclear spin polarization distribution with and without the quadrupolar coupling. We find that while hyperfine interactions drive dynamic nuclear polarization in such a way that the electron spin precession becomes synchronized with the driving, quadrupolar couplings counteract this phenomenon. The tension between these mechanisms is imprinted on the steady-state electron spin evolution, providing a way to measure the importance of quadrupolar interactions in a quantum dot. Our results show that higher-spin effects such as quadrupolar interactions can have a significant impact on the generation of dynamic nuclear polarization and how it influences the electron spin evolution.

TI Environmentally friendly synthesis of quantum dots and their
   applications in diverse fields from the perspective of environmental
   compliance: A review
SO DISCOVER NANO
AB Semiconductor Quantum-dots (QDs), characterized by their unique optoelectronic tunability, high efficiency, and multifunctionality, have emerged as transformative materials in diverse fields, including display technologies, energy conversion, solar cells, biomedical applications, and quantum technologies. With ongoing advancements in material synthesis and device engineering, the application scope of QDs is anticipated to expand further, thereby driving interdisciplinary technological innovations and fostering breakthroughs across multiple scientific fields. However, in recent years, the rapid development of Cd, Pb, and Hg-based QDs has raised significant environmental and biological concerns due to the inherent toxicity of these heavy metals. Consequently, these materials have been classified as restricted substances by major global entities, including international organizations, the European Union, and the United States, through international treaties and domestic legislation. To mitigate legal risks associated with environmental pollution, the development of non-toxic and environmentally friendly (eco-friendly) QDs has become imperative. This review focuses on several eco-friendly QDs, such as indium phosphide (InP), copper indium sulfide (CuInS2), and graphene QDs (GQDs), from the perspective of environmental compliance. It comprehensively discusses their synthesis methods, application domains, and the advantages and disadvantages of different preparation techniques, along with their environmental impacts. Finally, the review summarizes the existing challenges, limitations, and potential solutions for the development of environmentally benign QDs.

TI A universal speed limit for spreading of coherence
SO NATURE
AB Discoveries of fundamental limits for the rates of physical processes, from the speed of light to the Lieb-Robinson bound for information propagation1,2, often lead to breakthroughs in the understanding of the underlying physics. Here we observe such a limit for a paradigmatic many-body phenomenon, the spreading of coherence during the formation of a weakly interacting Bose-Einstein condensate3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17-18. We study condensate formation in an isolated homogeneous atomic gas19,20 that is initially far from equilibrium, in an incoherent low-energy state, and condenses as it relaxes towards equilibrium. Tuning the interatomic interactions that drive condensation, we show that the spreading of coherence through the system is initially slower for weaker interactions and faster for stronger ones, but always eventually reaches the same limit, at which the square of the coherence length grows at a universal rate given by the ratio of Planck's constant and the particle mass, or, equivalently, by the quantum of velocity circulation associated with a quantum vortex. These observations are robust to changes in the initial state, the gas density, and the system size. Our results provide benchmarks for theories of universality far from equilibrium21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33-34, are relevant for quantum technologies that rely on large-scale coherence, and invite similar measurements in other systems.

TI Exact lattice bosonization of finite N matrix quantum mechanics
   and c=1
SO JOURNAL OF HIGH ENERGY PHYSICS
AB We describe a new exact lattice bosonization of matrix quantum mechanics (equivalently of non-relativistic fermions) that is valid for arbitrary rank N of the matrix. It is based on the exact operator bosonization of non-relativistic fermions introduced earlier in [1]. The trace identities, which characterize finite rank matrices, are automatically incorporated in the bosonic theory. The finite number N of fermions is reflected in the finite number N of bosonic annihilation-creation operators, and equivalently to the finite number N of lattice points. The fermion Hamiltonian is exactly mappable to a bosonic Hamiltonian. At large N, the latter becomes local and corresponds to the lattice version of a relativistic boson Hamiltonian, with a lattice spacing of order 1/N. The finite lattice spacing leads to a finite entanglement entropy (EE) of the bosonic theory, which reproduces the finite EE of the fermionic theory. Such a description is not available in the standard bosonization in terms of fermion density fluctuations on the Fermi surface, which does not have a built-in short distance cut-off (see, however, a recent description of the finiteness of the fermionic EE in a collective field theory formalism [2]). The bosonic lattice constructed in our work is equipped with a geometry that is determined by the matrix potential or equivalently by the shape of the Fermi surface. Our bosonization also works in the double scaled c = 1 matrix model; in particular the bosonic EE again turns out to be finite, with the short distance cut-off turning into gsls, and reproduces the matrix result. Once again, this is to be contrasted with the conventional dual 2D string theory, where the bosonic EE is naturally identified with that of the "tachyon", the massless string mode, where one may imagine the short-distance cut-off to be the string length ls. This appears to indicate our bosonization as a different dual description to the c = 1 matrix model appropriate for "local physics" like quantum entanglement, by contrast with the conventional duality to the eigenvalue density which works well for asymptotic observables like S-matrices. We briefly discuss possible relation of our bosonization to D0 branes.

TI Effects of the thin-film thickness on superconducting NbTi microwave
   resonators for on-chip cryogenic thermometry
SO SUPERCONDUCTOR SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY
AB Superconducting microwave resonators have recently gained a primary importance in the development of cryogenic applications, such as circuit quantum electrodynamics, electron spin resonance spectroscopy and particles detection for high-energy physics and astrophysics. In this work, we investigate the influence of the film thickness on the temperature response of microfabricated Nb50Ti50 superconducting resonators. S-shaped split ring resonators (S-SRRs), approximately 20nm to 150nm thick, are designed to be electromagnetically coupled with standard Cu coplanar waveguides (CPWs) and their microwave properties are characterised at temperatures below 10K. The combined contributions of the kinetic inductance LK(T) increase and the decreasing loaded quality factor QL, for thinner films, induce an optimum condition on the temperature sensitivity and resolution of the resonators. A noise equivalent temperature as low as (0.53 +/- 0.09)mu KHz-1/2, at 1Hz, is reported for 100nm thick resonators at 4.2K. We also asses the possibility of implementing a multiplexed frequency readout, allowing for the simultaneous temperature tracking of several sensors along a single CPW. Such results demonstrate the possibility to perform a distributed cryogenic temperature monitoring, with a sub- mu K resolution. Thus, the application of superconducting S-SRRs, eventually benefiting from an even higher LK(T), for a further miniaturisation, as well as a back-end integration directly on-chip, can be envisioned for the accurate monitoring of localised temperature of devices operating in cryogenic conditions.

TI Polar Codes for Module-LWE Public Key Encryption: The Case of Kyber
SO CRYPTOGRAPHY
AB In modern society, the Internet is one of the most used means of communication. Thus, secure information transfer is inevitably of major importance. Computers nowadays use encryption methods based on arithmetic operations to turn messages into ciphertexts that are practically impossible for an attacker to reverse-engineer using a classical computer. Lately, it has been proven that this is possible in a post-quantum setting where quantum computers of considerable size are available to attackers. With the advance of technology of quantum computers, it is now more necessary than ever before to construct encryption schemes that cannot be broken either using a classical or a quantum computer. The National Institute of Technology and Standards (NIST) has orchestrated a competition, and numerous encryption schemes have been proposed. The NIST has identified one algorithm to be standardized for the post-quantum era. This algorithm is called CRYSTALS-Kyber and is based on module learning with errors (MLWE). This paper investigates how to apply error correcting codes in order to create some excess decryption failure rate (DFR) and to take advantage of that in order to re-tune Kyber's parameters in the pursuit of higher security. By applying Polar Codes, Kyber's security was managed to be increased by 54.4% under a new set of parameters, while keeping the decryption failure rate well below the upper acceptable bound set by the NIST.

TI Role of Boron in Assisting the Super-Enhancement of Emissions from
   Carbon-Implanted Silicon
SO MATERIALS
AB The super enhancement of silicon band edge luminescence when co-implanted with boron and carbon is reported. The role of boron in the band edge emissions in silicon was investigated by deliberately introducing defects into the lattice structures. We aimed to increase the light emission intensity from silicon by boron implantation, leading to the formation of dislocation loops between the lattice structures. The silicon samples were doped with a high concentration of carbon before boron implantation and then annealed at a high temperature to activate the dopants into substitutional lattice sites. Photoluminescence (PL) measurements were performed to observe the emissions at the near-infrared region. The temperatures were varied from 10 K to 100 K to study the effect of temperature on the peak luminescence intensity. Two main peaks could be seen at similar to 1112 and 1170 nm by observing the PL spectra. The intensities shown by both peaks in the samples incorporated with boron are significantly higher than those in pristine silicon samples, and the highest intensity in the former was 600 times greater than that in the latter. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) was used to study the structure of post-implant and post-anneal silicon sample. The dislocation loops were observed in the sample. Through a technique compatible with mature silicon processing technology, the results of this study will greatly contribute to the development of all Si-based photonic systems and quantum technologies.

TI Theory of Edge Effects and Conductance for Applications in
   Graphene-Based Nanoantennas
SO APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL
AB In this paper, we present a theory of edge effects in graphene for its applications to nanoantennas in the THz, infrared, and visible frequency ranges. The novelty of the presented model is reflected in its self-consistency, which is reached due to the formulation in terms of dynamical conductance instead of ordinary surface conductivity. The physical model of edge effects is based on using the concept of the Dirac fermion and the Kubo approach. In contrast with earlier well-known and widely used models, the surface conductance becomes non-homogeneous and non-local. The numerical simulations of the spatial behavior of the surface conductance were performed in a wide range of values, known from the literature, for the graphene ribbon widths and electrochemical potential. It is shown that if the length exceeds 800 nm, our model agrees with the classical Drude conductivity model with a relatively high degree of accuracy. For rather short lengths, the conductance exhibits a new type of spatial oscillations, which are not present in the ordinary conductivity model. These oscillations modify the form of effective boundary conditions and integral equations for electromagnetic field at the surface of graphene-based antenna. The developed theory opens a new way for realizing electrically controlled nanoantennas by changing the electrochemical potential via gate voltage. The obtained results may be applicable for the design of different carbon-based nanodevices in modern quantum technologies.

TI Atomic fluctuations lifting the energy degeneracy in Si/SiGe quantum
   dots
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Electron spins in Si/SiGe quantum wells suffer from nearly degenerate conduction band valleys, which compete with the spin degree of freedom in the formation of qubits. Despite attempts to enhance the valley energy splitting deterministically, by engineering a sharp interface, valley splitting fluctuations remain a serious problem for qubit uniformity, needed to scale up to large quantum processors. Here, we elucidate and statistically predict the valley splitting by the holistic integration of 3D atomic-level properties, theory and transport. We find that the concentration fluctuations of Si and Ge atoms within the 3D landscape of Si/SiGe interfaces can explain the observed large spread of valley splitting from measurements on many quantum dot devices. Against the prevailing belief, we propose to boost these random alloy composition fluctuations by incorporating Ge atoms in the Si quantum well to statistically enhance valley splitting.
   Spin qubits in Si/SiGe quantum dots suffer from variability in the valley splitting which will hinder device scalability. Here, by using 3D atomic characterization, the authors explain this variability by random Si and Ge atomic fluctuations and propose a strategy to statistically enhance the valley splitting

TI Field-theoretical approach to open quantum systems and the Lindblad
   equation
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB We develop a systematic field-theoretical approach to open quantum systems based on condensed-matter many-body methods. The time evolution of the reduced density matrix for the open quantum system is determined by a transmission matrix. Developing diagrammatic perturbation theory, invoking Wick???s theorem in connection with a Caldeira-Leggett quantum oscillator environment in thermal equilibrium, the transmission matrix satisfies a Dyson equation characterized by an irreducible kernel. Unlike the Nakajima-Zwanzig and standard approaches, the Dyson equation is equivalent to a general non-Markovian master equation for the reduced density matrix, incorporating secular effects and independent of the initial preparation. The kernel is determined by a systematic diagrammatic expansion in powers of the interaction. We consider the Born approx-imation for the kernel. Applying a condensed-matter pole or, equivalently, a quasiparticle-type approximation, equivalent to the usual assumption of a timescale separation, we derive a master equation of the Markov type. Furthermore, imposing the rotating-wave approximation, we obtain a Markov master equation of the Lindblad form. To illustrate the method, we consider the standard example of a single qubit coupled to a thermal heat bath.

TI Determination of Dynamical Quantum Phase Transitions in Strongly
   Correlated Many-Body Systems Using Loschmidt Cumulants
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW X
AB Dynamical phase transitions extend the notion of criticality to nonstationary settings and are characterized by sudden changes in the macroscopic properties of time-evolving quantum systems. Investigations of dynamical phase transitions combine aspects of symmetry, topology, and nonequilibrium physics; however, progress has been hindered by the notorious difficulties of predicting the time evolution of large, interacting quantum systems. Here, we tackle this outstanding problem by determining the critical times of interacting many-body systems after a quench using Loschmidt cumulants. Specifically, we investigate dynamical topological phase transitions in the interacting Kitaev chain and in the spin-1 Heisenberg chain. To this end, we map out the thermodynamic lines of complex times, where the Loschmidt amplitude vanishes, and identify the intersections with the imaginary axis, which yield the real critical times after a quench. For the Kitaev chain, we can accurately predict how the critical behavior is affected by strong interactions, which gradually shift the time at which a dynamical phase transition occurs. We also discuss the experimental perspectives of predicting the first critical time of a quantum many-body system by measuring the energy fluctuations in the initial state, and we describe the prospects of implementing our method on a near-term quantum computer with a limited number of qubits. Our work demonstrates that Loschmidt cumulants are a powerful tool to unravel the far-from-equilibrium dynamics of strongly correlated many-body systems, and our approach can immediately be applied in higher dimensions.

TI Directional Coupling to a λ/5000 Nanowaveguide
SO ACS NANO
AB Silicon-based microdevices are considered promising candidates for consolidating several terahertz technologies into a common and practical platform. The practicality stems from the relatively low loss, device compactness, ease of fabrication, and wide range of available passive and active functionalities. Nevertheless, typical device footprints are limited by diffraction to several hundreds of micrometers, which hinders emerging nanoscale applications at terahertz frequencies. While metallic gap modes provide nanoscale terahertz confinement, efficiently coupling to them is difficult. Here, we present and experimentally demonstrate a strategy for efficiently interfacing subterahertz radiation (lambda = 1 mm) to a waveguide formed by a nanogap, etched in a gold film, that is 200 nm (lambda/5000) wide and up to 4.5 mm long. The design principle relies on phase matching dielectric and nanogap waveguide modes, resulting in efficient directional coupling between them when they are placed side-by-side. Broadband far-field terahertz transmission experiments through the dielectric waveguide reveal a transmission dip near the designed wavelength due to resonant coupling. Near-field measurements on the surface of the gold layer confirm that such a dip is accompanied by a transfer of power to the nanogap, with an estimated coupling efficiency of similar to 10%. Our approach efficiently interfaces millimeter waves with nanoscale waveguides in a tailored and controllable manner, with important implications for on-chip nanospectroscopy, telecommunications, and quantum technologies.

TI Tunable entangled photon-pair generation in a liquid crystal
SO NATURE
AB Liquid crystals, with their ability to self-assemble, strong response to an electric field and integrability into complex systems, are key materials in light-beam manipulation(1). The recently discovered ferroelectric nematic liquid crystals(2,3) also have considerable second-order optical nonlinearity, making them a potential material for nonlinear optics(4,5). Their use as sources of quantum light could considerably extend the boundaries of photonic quantum technologies(6). However, spontaneous parametric down-conversion, the basic source of entangled photons(7), heralded single photons(8) and squeezed light(9), has so far not been observed in liquid crystals-or in any liquids or organic materials. Here we implement spontaneous parametric down-conversion in a ferroelectric nematic liquid crystal and demonstrate electric-field tunable broadband generation of entangled photons, with an efficiency comparable to that of the best nonlinear crystals. The emission rate and polarization state of photon pairs is markedly varied by applying a few volts or twisting the molecular orientation along the sample. A liquid-crystal source enables a special type of quasi-phase matching(10), which is based on the molecular twist structure and is therefore reconfigurable for the desired spectral and polarization properties of photon pairs. Such sources promise to outperform standard nonlinear optical materials in terms of functionality, brightness and the tunability of the generated quantum state. The concepts developed here can be extended to complex topological structures, macroscopic devices and multi-pixel tunable quantum light sources.

TI Prolonged photostability in hexagonal boron nitride quantum emitters
SO COMMUNICATIONS MATERIALS
AB Hexagonal boron nitride is a promising host for single-photon quantum emitters, but irreversible loss of emission by photobleaching hinders its practical use. Here, the mechanistic investigation of hBN emitters reveals two distinct photobleaching lifetimes, suggesting a way to mitigate the shorter, environmentally sensitive, bleaching process.
   Single-photon emitters are crucial building blocks for optical quantum technologies. Hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) is a promising two-dimensional material that hosts bright, room-temperature single-photon emitters. However, photo instability is a persistent challenge preventing practical applications of these properties. Here, we reveal the ubiquitous photobleaching of hBN vacancy emitters. Independent of the source or the number of hBN layers, we find that the photobleaching of a common emission at 1.98 +/- 0.05 eV can be described by two consistent time constants, namely a first bleaching lifetime of 5 to 10 s, and a second bleaching lifetime in the range of 150 to 220 s. Only the former is environmentally sensitive and can be significantly mitigated by shielding O-2, whereas the latter could be the result of carbon-assisted defect migration. Annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscopy of photobleached hBN allows for visualizing vacancy defects and carbon substitution at single atom resolution, supporting the migration mechanism along with X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. Thermal annealing at 850 degrees C of liquid exfoliated hBN eliminates both bleaching processes, leading to persistent photostability. These results represent a significant advance to potentially engineer hBN vacancy emitters with the photostability requisite for quantum applications.

TI Magnetic nature and hyperfine interactions of transition metal atoms
   adsorbed on ultrathin insulating films: a challenge for DFT
SO PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY CHEMICAL PHYSICS
AB The magnetic ground state and the hyperfine coupling parameters of some first-row transition metal (TM) atoms (Ti, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, and Ni) adsorbed on ultrathin insulating oxide films are studied by means of DFT calculations. The results obtained using GGA, screened hybrid, and GGA+U functionals are compared for TMs adsorbed on free-standing MgO(100). Then, the case of adsorption on MgO mono- and bilayers supported on Ag(100) is studied using GGA+U. Along with the problematic aspects inherent to the calculation of hyperfine coupling constants, a critical dependence on the magnetic state and electron configuration of the TM is reported, which implies a real challenge for the state-of-the-art DFT methods. In the cases where all functionals considered provide a coherent magnetic and electron configuration, however, the calculated hyperfine parameters do not depend significantly on the choice of the functional. In this respect, the role of the metal support in the hyperfine coupling constants is highly system-dependent and becomes crucial in all cases where the support modifies the oxidation state of the adatom, induces a change in the bonding site or simply induces a rearrangement of the orbital energy diagram. This has important implications for the modelling of single TM atoms deposited on insulating ultrathin films supported on metals for application in quantum technologies or as memory devices.

TI Bright and Stable Single-Photon Emission in Zinc-Alloyed CsPbBr3
   Nanocrystals Through Controlled Auger Recombination
SO SMALL
AB Single-photon sources (SPS) are indispensable for various quantum technologies. Colloidal lead halide perovskites (LHPs) have recently attracted significant attention as SPS due to their excellent electrical and optical properties at room temperature. However, their practical application is hindered by their poor stability and a trade-off between single-photon purity and non-blinking emission, the latter being essential for light-emitting diode (LED) and laser applications. In this study, Zn-alloyed CsPbBr3 nanocrystals (Zn-NCs) are successfully synthesized using ZnBr2 as a dopant, achieving superior optical properties compared to the undoped pristine nanocrystals (P-NCs). This approach simultaneously replaces toxic Pb2(+) with Zn2(+) and eliminates deep trap states associated with halide vacancies through Br- passivation. This resulted in exceptional stability and a near-unity photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) of the treated nanocrystals (NCs). Single-particle photoluminescence (PL) studies reveal that Zn-NCs exhibit superior single-photon purity, reduced blinking, and greater photostability compared to their undoped counterparts. Femtosecond transient absorption spectroscopy (fs-TAS) showed that Zn alloying accelerates nonradiative Auger recombination, thereby suppressing multiphoton emission and consequently enhancing single-photon purity. By integrating results from multiple techniques, it is demonstrated that Zn2+ alloying in the CsPbBr3 NC lattice significantly enhanced the stability, brightness, and single-photon purity while simultaneously minimizing the blinking.

TI Simplified Josephson-junction fabrication process for reproducibly
   high-performance superconducting qubits
SO APPLIED PHYSICS LETTERS

   50
   mu s (
   Q > 1.5 x 1
   0
   6). Current shadow-evaporation techniques for aluminum-based Josephson junctions require a separate lithography step to deposit a patch that makes a galvanic, superconducting connection between the junction electrodes and the circuit wiring layer. The patch connection eliminates parasitic junctions, which otherwise contribute significantly to dielectric loss. In our patch-integrated cross-type junction technique, we use one lithography step and one vacuum cycle to evaporate both the junction electrodes and the patch. This eliminates a key bottleneck in manufacturing superconducting qubits by reducing the fabrication time and cost. In a study of more than 3600 junctions, we show an average resistance variation of 3.7% on a wafer that contains forty
   0.5 x 0.5-cm(2) chips, with junction areas ranging between 0.01 and 0.16 mu m(2). The average on-chip spread in resistance is 2.7%, with 20 chips varying between 1.4% and 2%. For the junction sizes used for transmon qubits, we deduce a wafer-level transition-frequency variation of 1.7%-2.5%. We show that 60%-70% of this variation is attributed to junction-area fluctuations, while the rest is caused by tunnel-junction inhomogeneity. Such high frequency predictability is a requirement for scaling-up the number of qubits in a quantum computer.

TI Microfluidics and Nanofluidics in Strong Light-Matter Coupling Systems
SO NANOMATERIALS
AB The combination of micro- or nanofluidics and strong light-matter coupling has gained much interest in the past decade, which has led to the development of advanced systems and devices with numerous potential applications in different fields, such as chemistry, biosensing, and material science. Strong light-matter coupling is achieved by placing a dipole (e.g., an atom or a molecule) into a confined electromagnetic field, with molecular transitions being in resonance with the field and the coupling strength exceeding the average dissipation rate. Despite intense research and encouraging results in this field, some challenges still need to be overcome, related to the fabrication of nano- and microscale optical cavities, stability, scaling up and production, sensitivity, signal-to-noise ratio, and real-time control and monitoring. The goal of this paper is to summarize recent developments in micro- and nanofluidic systems employing strong light-matter coupling. An overview of various methods and techniques used to achieve strong light-matter coupling in micro- or nanofluidic systems is presented, preceded by a brief outline of the fundamentals of strong light-matter coupling and optofluidics operating in the strong coupling regime. The potential applications of these integrated systems in sensing, optofluidics, and quantum technologies are explored. The challenges and prospects in this rapidly developing field are discussed.

TI High kinetic inductance NbTiN films for quantum limited travelling wave
   parametric amplifiers
SO PHYSICA SCRIPTA
AB A wide-bandwidth and low-noise amplification chain in the microwave regime is crucial for the efficient read-out of quantum systems based on superconducting detectors, such as Microwave Kinetic Inductance Detectors (MKIDs), Transition Edge Sensors (TESs), Magnetic Microcalorimeters (MMCs), and RF cavities, as well as qubits. Kinetic Inductance Travelling Wave Parametric Amplifiers (KI-TWPAs) operated in a three-wave mixing fashion have demonstrated exceptional dynamic range and low-noise performance, approaching the quantum limit. These amplifiers can be fabricated using a single layer of a high kinetic inductance film as weakly dispersive artificial transmission lines, with the ability to control the phase-matched bandwidth through dispersion engineering. In this study, we present the optimisation of the rf sputter-deposition process of NbTiN films using a Nb80%Ti20% target, with the goal of achieving precise control over film characteristics, resulting in high kinetic inductance while maintaining a high transition temperature. The parameter landscape related to the different sputtering conditions, such as pressure, power, and nitrogen flow, has been explored and the film thickness has been used as a fine-tuning parameter to adjust the properties of the final NbTiN films used for the fabrication of KI-TWPAs. As a final result, we have obtained a NbTiN film with a kinetic inductance of 8.5 pH/sq which we have exploited to fabricate KI-TWPA prototype devices, showing promising amplification performance.

TI Observation of large spontaneous emission rate enhancement of quantum
   dots in a broken-symmetry slow-light waveguide
SO NPJ QUANTUM INFORMATION
AB Quantum states of light and matter can be manipulated on the nanoscale to provide a technological resource for aiding the implementation of scalable photonic quantum technologies. Experimental progress relies on the quality and efficiency of the coupling between photons and internal spin states of quantum emitters. Here we demonstrate a nanophotonic waveguide platform with embedded quantum dots (QDs) that enables both Purcell-enhanced emission and strong chiral coupling. The design uses slow-light effects in a glide-plane photonic crystal waveguide with QD tuning to match the emission frequency to the slow-light region. Simulations were used to map the chirality and Purcell enhancement depending on the position of a dipole emitter relative to the air holes. The highest Purcell factors and chirality occur in separate regions, but there is still a significant area where high values of both can be obtained. Based on this, we first demonstrate a record large radiative decay rate of 17 +/- 2 ns(-1) (60 +/- 6 ps lifetime) corresponding to a 20 +/- 2 fold Purcell enhancement. This was achieved by electric-field tuning of the QD to the slow-light region and quasi-resonant phonon-side band excitation. We then demonstrate a 5 +/- 1 fold Purcell enhancement for a dot with high degree of chiral coupling to waveguide modes, substantially surpassing all previous measurements. Together these demonstrate the excellent prospects for using QDs in scalable implementations of on-chip spin-photonics relying on chiral quantum optics.

TI Orientation-Dependent Interaction between the Magnetic Plasmons in Gold
   Nanocups and the Excitons in WS2 Monolayer and Multilayer
SO ACS NANO
AB The integration of two-dimensional transition metal dichalcogenides with plasmonic nanostructures is extremely attractive for the investigation of the resonance coupling between plasmons and excitons, which offers a framework for the study of cavity quantum electrodynamics and is of great potential for exploring diverse quantum technologies. Herein we report on the coupling between the magnetic plasmons supported by individual asymmetric Au nanocups and the excitons in WS2 monolayer and multilayer. Resonance coupling with the strength varying from weak to strong regimes is realized by adjusting the orientation of the individual Au nanocups on WS2 monolayer. Different energy detunings between the magnetic plasmons and the excitons are achieved by varying the size of the Au nanocup. The Rabi splitting energies extracted at zero detuning are up to 106 meV. The anticrossing feature is observed in the measured scattering spectra and simulated absorption spectra, which indicates that the resonance coupling between the magnetic plasmons in the Au nanocup and the excitons in WS2 monolayer enters the strongly coupled regime. A dependence of the coupling strength on the layer number is further observed when the Au nanocups are coupled with WS2 multilayer. Our study suggests a promising approach toward the realization of different coupling regimes in a simple hybrid system made of individual Au nanocups and two-dimensional materials.

TI Seeing quantum effects in experiments
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW PHYSICS EDUCATION RESEARCH
AB [This paper is part of the Focused Collection on Instructional labs: Improving traditions and new directions.] Quantum mechanics is a field often considered very mathematical, abstract, and unintuitive. One way some instructors are hoping to help familiarize their students with these complex topics is to have the students see quantum effects in experiments in undergraduate instructional labs. Here, we present results from an interview study about what it means to both instructors and students to see quantum effects in experiments. We focus on a popular set of quantum optics experiments and find that students believe they are observing quantum effects and achieving related learning goals by working with these experiments. Although it is not possible to see the quantum phenomena directly with their eyes, students point out different aspects of the experiments that contribute to them observing quantum effects. This often includes seeing the experimental results, sometimes in conjunction with interacting with or understanding part of the experiment. There is additional variation across student achievement of the various related learning goals, ranging from many of the students being excited about these experiments and making a connection between the mathematical theory and the experiments to only some of the students seeing a connection between these experiments and quantum technologies. This work can help instructors consider the importance and framing of quantum experiments and raises questions about when and how in the curriculum quantum experiments can be best utilized and how to make related learning goals available to all students.

TI Time-Resolved Diamond Magnetic Microscopy of Superparamagnetic
   Iron-Oxide Nanoparticles
SO ACS NANO
AB Superparamagnetic iron-oxide nanoparticles (SPIONs) are promising probes for biomedical imaging, but the heterogeneity of their magnetic properties is difficult to characterize with existing methods. Here, we perform wide-field imaging of the stray magnetic fields produced by hundreds of isolated similar to 30 nm SPIONs using a magnetic microscope based on nitrogen-vacancy centers in diamond. By analyzing the SPION magnetic field patterns as a function of the applied magnetic field, we observe substantial field-dependent transverse magnetization components that are typically obscured with ensemble characterization methods. We found negligible hysteresis in each of the three magnetization components for nearly all SPIONs in our sample. Most SPIONs exhibit a sharp Langevin saturation curve, enumerated by a characteristic polarizing applied field, B c. The B c distribution is highly asymmetric, with a standard deviation (sigma c = 1.4 mT) that is larger than the median (0.6 mT). Using time-resolved magnetic microscopy, we directly record SPION Neel relaxation, after switching off a 31 mT applied field, with a temporal resolution of similar to 60 ms, which is limited by the ring-down time of the electromagnet coils. For small bias fields |B hold| = 1.5-3.5 mT, we observe a broad range of SPION Neel relaxation times - from milliseconds to seconds - that are consistent with an exponential dependence on B hold. Our time-resolved diamond magnetic microscopy study reveals rich SPION sample heterogeneity and may be extended to other fundamental studies of nanomagnetism.

TI Enhancement of Magnetic Shielding Based on Low-Noise Materials,
   Magnetization Control, and Active Compensation: A Review
SO MATERIALS
AB Magnetic-shielding technologies play a crucial role in the field of ultra-sensitive physical measurement, medical imaging, quantum sensing, etc. With the increasing demand for the accuracy of magnetic measurement, the performance requirements of magnetic-shielding devices are also higher, such as the extremely weak magnetic field, gradient, and low-frequency noise. However, the conventional method to improve the shielding performance by adding layers of materials is restricted by complex construction and inherent materials noise. This paper provides a comprehensive review about the enhancement of magnetic shielding in three aspects, including low-noise materials, magnetization control, and active compensation. The generation theorem and theoretical calculation of materials magnetic noise is summarized first, focusing on the development of spinel ferrites, amorphous, and nanocrystalline. Next, the principles and applications of two magnetization control methods, degaussing and magnetic shaking, are introduced. In the review of the active magnetic compensation system, the forward and inverse design methods of coil and the calculation method of the coupling effect under the ferromagnetic boundary of magnetic shield are explained in detail, and their applications, especially in magnetocardiography (MCG) and magnetoencephalogram (MEG), are also mainly described. In conclusion, the unresolved challenges of different enhancement methods in materials preparation, optimization of practical implementation, and future applications are proposed, which provide comprehensive and instructive references for corresponding research.

TI Quantum force sensing by digital twinning of atomic Bose-Einstein
   condensates
SO COMMUNICATIONS PHYSICS
AB High sensitivity detection plays a vital role in science discoveries and technological applications. While intriguing methods utilizing collective many-body correlations and quantum entanglements have been developed in physics to enhance sensitivity, their practical implementation remains challenging due to rigorous technological requirements. Here, we propose an entirely data-driven approach that harnesses the capabilities of machine learning, to significantly augment weak-signal detection sensitivity. In an atomic force sensor, our method combines a digital replica of force-free data with anomaly detection technique, devoid of any prior knowledge about the physical system or assumptions regarding the sensing process. Our findings demonstrate a significant advancement in sensitivity, achieving an order of magnitude improvement over conventional protocols in detecting a weak force of approximately 10-25N. The resulting sensitivity reaches 1.7 ( 4 ) x 1 0 - 25 N / Hz \documentclass[12pt]{minimal} \usepackage{amsmath} \usepackage{wasysym} \usepackage{amsfonts} \usepackage{amssymb} \usepackage{amsbsy} \usepackage{mathrsfs} \usepackage{upgreek} \setlength{\oddsidemargin}{-69pt} \begin{document}$$1.7(4)\times 1{0}<^>{-25}\,{{{{{{{\rm{N}}}}}}}}/\sqrt{{{{{{{{\rm{Hz}}}}}}}}}$$\end{document} . Our machine learning-based signal processing approach does not rely on system-specific details or processed signals, rendering it highly applicable to sensing technologies across various domains.
   In this study, the authors propose a generic machine-learning-assisted framework to improve the overall performance of quantum sensing application. In the context of an atomic force sensor, this entirely data-driven approach, which involves generating the digital twinning of experimental data, demonstrates an order of magnitude improvement in sensitivity compared to conventional protocols.

TI Exciton Formation Dynamics and Band-Like Free Charge-Carrier Transport
   in 2D Metal Halide Perovskite Semiconductors
SO ADVANCED FUNCTIONAL MATERIALS
AB Metal halide perovskite (MHP) semiconductors have driven a revolution in optoelectronic technologies over the last decade, in particular for high-efficiency photovoltaic applications. Low-dimensional MHPs presenting electronic confinement have promising additional prospects in light emission and quantum technologies. However, the optimisation of such applications requires a comprehensive understanding of the nature of charge carriers and their transport mechanisms. This study employs a combination of ultrafast optical and terahertz spectroscopy to investigate phonon energies, charge-carrier mobilities, and exciton formation in 2D (PEA)(2)PbI4 and (BA)(2)PbI4 (where PEA is phenylethylammonium and BA is butylammonium). Temperature-dependent measurements of free charge-carrier mobilities reveal band transport in these strongly confined semiconductors, with surprisingly high in-plane mobilities. Enhanced charge-phonon coupling is shown to reduce charge-carrier mobilities in (BA)(2)PbI4 with respect to (PEA)(2)PbI4. Exciton and free charge-carrier dynamics are disentangled by simultaneous monitoring of transient absorption and THz photoconductivity. A sustained free charge-carrier population is observed, surpassing the Saha equation predictions even at low temperature. These findings provide new insights into the temperature-dependent interplay of exciton and free-carrier populations in 2D MHPs. Furthermore, such sustained free charge-carrier population and high mobilities demonstrate the potential of these semiconductors for applications such as solar cells, transistors, and electrically driven light sources.

TI Above-Room-Temperature Ferromagnetism in Large-Scale Epitaxial
   Fe3GaTe2/Graphene van der Waals Heterostructures
SO ACS NANO
AB Fe3GaTe2 (FGaT), a two-dimensional (2D) layered ferromagnetic metal, exhibits a high Curie temperature (T-C) of similar to 360 K along with strong perpendicular magnetic anisotropy (PMA), making it a promising material candidate for next-generation energy-efficient magnetic devices. However, the vast majority of studies on FGaT to date have been limited to millimeter-sized bulk crystals and exfoliated flakes, which are unsuitable for practical applications and integration into device processing. Also, its combination with other 2D materials to form van der Waals (vdW) heterostructures has only been achieved by flake stacking. Consequently, the controlled large-area growth of FGaT and related heterostructures remains largely unexplored. In this work, we demonstrate the high-quality, large-area growth of epitaxial FGaT thin films on single-crystalline graphene/SiC templates using molecular beam epitaxy. Structural characterization confirms the high crystalline quality of the continuous FGaT/graphene vdW heterostructures. Temperature-dependent magnetization and anomalous Hall measurements reveal robust PMA with an enhanced T-C well above room temperature, reaching up to 400 K. Furthermore, X-ray absorption and X-ray magnetic circular dichroism spectra provide insight into the spin and orbital magnetic moment contributions, further validating the high T-C and robust PMA. These findings are highly significant for the future development of high-performance spintronic devices based on 2D heterostructures, with potential applications in next-generation data storage, logic processing, and quantum technologies.

TI Coupling nitrogen-vacancy center spins in diamond to a grape dimer
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW APPLIED
AB Two grapes irradiated inside a microwave (MW) oven typically produce a series of sparks and can ignite a violent plasma. The underlying cause of the plasma has been attributed to the formation of morphological-dependent resonances (MDRs) in the aqueous dielectric dimers that lead to the generation of a strong evanescent MW hotspot between them. Previous experiments have focused on the electric field component of the field as the driving force behind the plasma ignition. Here we couple an ensemble of nitrogen-vacancy (N-V) spins in nanodiamonds (NDs) to the magnetic field component of the dimer MW field. We demonstrate the efficient coupling of the N-V spins to the MW magnetic field hotspot formed between the grape dimers using optically detected magnetic resonance (ODMR). The ODMR measurements are performed by coupling N-V spins in NDs to the evanescent MW fields of a copper wire. When placing a pair of grapes around the NDs and matching the ND position with the expected magnetic field hotspot, we see an enhancement in the ODMR contrast by more than a factor of 2 compared to the measurements without grapes. Using finite-element modeling, we attribute our experimental observation of the field enhancement to the MW hotspot formation between the grape dimers. The present study not only validates previous work on understanding grape-dimer resonator geometries, but it also opens up another avenue for exploring alternative MW resonator designs for quantum technologies.

TI Advanced fiber in-coupling through nanoprinted axially symmetric
   structures
SO APPLIED PHYSICS REVIEWS
AB Here, we introduce and demonstrate nanoprinted all-dielectric nanostructures located on fiber end faces as a novel concept for the efficient coupling of light into optical fibers, especially at multiple incidence angles and across large angular intervals. Taking advantage of the unique properties of the nanoprinting technology, such as flexibly varying the width, height, and gap distance of each individual element, we realize different polymeric axial-symmetric structures, such as double-pitch gratings and aperiodic arrays, placed on the facet of commercial step-index fibers. Of particular note is the aperiodic geometry, enabling an unprecedentedly high average coupling efficiency across the entire angular range up to 80 degrees, outperforming regular gratings and especially bare fibers by orders of magnitude. The excellent agreement between simulation and experiment clearly demonstrates the quality of the fabricated structures and the high accuracy of the nanoprinting process. Our approach enables realizing highly integrated and ready-to-use fiber devices, defining a new class of compact, flexible, and practically relevant all-fiber devices beyond the state-of-art. Applications can be found in a variety of cutting-edge fields that require highly efficient light collection over selected angular intervals, such as endoscopy or quantum technologies. Furthermore, fiber functionalization through nanoprinting represents a promising approach for interfacing highly complex functional photonic structures with optical fibers. (c) 2023 Author(s).

TI Large Angular Momentum
SO MAGNETISM
AB The quantum states of a spin 12 (a qubit) are parametrized by the space CP1 similar to S2, the Bloch sphere. A spin j for a generic j (a 2j+1-state system) is represented instead by a point in a larger space, CP2j. Here we study the state of a single angular momentum/spin in the limit j ->infinity. A special class of states, |j,n >is an element of CP2j, with spin oriented towards definite spatial directions, n is an element of S2, i.e., (J<^><middle dot>n)|j,n >=j|j,n >, are found to behave as classical angular momenta, jn, in this limit. Vice versa, general spin states in CP2j do not become classical, even at a large j. We study these questions by analyzing the Stern-Gerlach processes, the angular momentum composition rule, and the rotation matrix. Our observations help to better clarify how classical mechanics emerges from quantum mechanics in this context (e.g., with the unique trajectories of a particle carrying a large spin in an inhomogeneous magnetic field) and to make the widespread idea that large spins somehow become classical more precise.

AB Estimating the state preparation fidelity of highly entangled states on noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices is an important task for benchmarking and application considerations. Unfortunately, exact fidelity measurements quickly become prohibitively expensive, as they scale exponentially as O(3(N)) for N-qubit states, using full state tomography with measurements in all Pauli bases combinations. However, Somma et al. [20] established that the complexity could be drastically reduced when looking at fidelity lower bounds for states that exhibit symmetries, such as Dicke States and GHZ States. For larger states, these bounds still need to be tight enough to provide reasonable estimations on NISQ devices. For the first time and more than 15 years after the theoretical introduction, we report meaningful lower bounds for the state preparation fidelity of all Dicke States up to N = 10, and all GHZ states up to N = 20 on Quantinuum H1 ion-trap systems using efficient implementations of recently proposed scalable circuits for these states. Our achieved lower bounds match or exceed previously reported exact fidelities on superconducting systems for much smaller states. This work provides a path forward to benchmarking entanglement as NISQ devices improve in size and quality.

TI Real-time optimal quantum control of mechanical motion at room
   temperature
SO NATURE
AB The ability to accurately control the dynamics of physical systems by measurement and feedback is a pillar of modern engineering(1). Today, the increasing demand for applied quantum technologies requires adaptation of this level of control to individual quantum systems(2,3). Achieving this in an optimal way is a challenging task that relies on both quantum-limited measurements and specifically tailored algorithms for state estimation and feedback(4). Successful implementations thus far include experiments on the level of optical and atomic systems(5-7). Here we demonstrate real-time optimal control of the quantum trajectory(8) of an optically trapped nanoparticle. We combine confocal position sensing close to the Heisenberg limit with optimal state estimation via Kalman filtering to track the particle motion in phase space in real time with a position uncertainty of 1.3 times the zero-point fluctuation. Optimal feedback allows us to stabilize the quantum harmonic oscillator to a mean occupation of 0.56 +/- 0.02 quanta, realizing quantum ground-state cooling from room temperature. Our work establishes quantum Kalman filtering as a method to achieve quantum control of mechanical motion, with potential implications for sensing on all scales. In combination with levitation, this paves the way to full-scale control over the wavepacket dynamics of solid-state macroscopic quantum objects in linear and nonlinear systems.
   Optimal quantum control of an optically trapped nanoparticle in its ground state is demonstrated at room temperature, using Kalman filtering to track its quantum trajectory in real time.

TI Ultrabroadband (Vis-NIR) Emission in Single-Component Perovskite LEDs
   via Tailored Multi-Exciton Energy Transfer Pathways
SO ADVANCED MATERIALS
AB The development of ultrabroadband light sources spanning the visible (Vis) to near-infrared (NIR) range is of fundamental importance for cutting-edge applications in communication, metrology, and quantum technologies. Although phosphor-converted LEDs have extended emission, they still suffer from spectral gaps, inadequate color rendering, and constrained NIR output. Here, a promising approach is introduced by tailoring multi-exciton energy transfer pathways to realize ultrabroadband Vis-to-NIR emission in Sb3(+)/Ln3(+) co-doped vacancy-ordered Cs2HfCl6 perovskite nanocrystals. By systematically optimizing Sb3(+) and Ln3(+) doping concentrations, excitation wavelengths, and lanthanide ion selection, the energy transfer pathways between singlet and triplet self-trapped exciton (STE) states and lanthanide energy levels are modulated. This design facilitates broad spectral tunability through energy distribution control among emission centers, improves radiative efficiency by reducing energy losses during transfer processes, and promotes stable performance by mitigating excessive energy accumulation. The resulting single-component LED based on Sb3(+)/Pr3(+) co-doped NCs delivers broadband emission extending to approximate to 1200 nm, high spectral quality (CRI similar to 98.1, R9 similar to 98), strong visible/NIR PLQY (approximate to 80%), and steady operation over 50 h. The findings provide insight into energy transfer engineering in low-dimensional perovskites and offer a viable route toward emerging ultrabroadband solid-state light sources.

TI Dynamic Polarization Control of Nonlinear Terahertz Photoresponse via
   Topological Phase Transitions
SO RESEARCH
AB Precise modulation of topologically protected states via external stimuli, such as electric, optical, and magnetic fields, is a cornerstone for advancing robust topological photonics and quantum technologies. However, the realization of dynamic and noninvasive control remains constrained by the high-energy thresholds of conventional stimuli, which can disrupt delicate topological states. Here, we employ low-energy terahertz excitation to directly probe the photoresponse across a temperature-induced topological phase transition in ultrathin ZrTe5, a material at the intersection of topological physics and low-dimensional systems, leveraging its unique ability to interact with low-energy quasiparticle states without compromising coherence in the system. We observe a giant and robust nonlinear terahertz photoresponse characterized by in situ tunable geometric properties of Bloch quasiparticles. The response exhibits colossal behavior and a sign reversal across a temperature-driven topological phase transition, linked to a nonvanishing Berry curvature dipole that serves as a direct marker of symmetry-breaking evolution between weak (m < 0) and strong (m > 0) topological insulator phases. The observed device exhibits a response time of similar to 1 mu s with a noise equivalent power of 5.6 pW/Hz(0.5) across the 0.5-THz range, demonstrating the potential of topological phase transitions for terahertz detection. These findings underscore the potential of low-energy terahertz excitation for dynamically polarizing and controlling topological states in ultrathin materials, offering a versatile framework for exploring symmetry-breaking phenomena and advancing next-generation optoelectronic devices.

TI Quantum chaos, randomness and universal scaling of entanglement in
   various Krylov spaces
SO SCIPOST PHYSICS
AB Multipartite entanglement is a crucial resource for advancing quantum technologies, with considerable research efforts directed toward achieving its rapid and scalable generation. In this work, we derive an analytical expression for the time-averaged quantum Fisher information (QFI), enabling the detection of scalable multipartite entanglement dynamically generated by all quantum chaotic systems governed by Dyson's ensembles. Our approach integrates concepts of randomness and quantum chaos, demonstrating that the QFI is universally determined by the structure and dimension of the Krylov space that confines the chaotic dynamics. In particular, the QFI ranges from N2/3 for N qubits in the permutation-symmetric subspace (e.g. for chaotic kicked top models with long-range interactions), to N when the dynamics extend over the full Hilbert space with or without bit reversal symmetry or parity symmetry (e.g. in chaotic models with shortrange Ising-like interactions). In the former case, the QFI reveals multipartite entanglement among N/3 qubits and highlights the power of chaotic collective spin systems in generating scalable multipartite entanglement. Interestingly this result can be related to isotropic substructures in the Wigner distribution of chaotic states and demonstrates the efficacy of quantum chaos for Heisenberg-scaling quantum metrology. Finally, our general expression for the QFI agrees with that obtained for random states and, differently from out-of-time-order-correlators, it can also distinguish chaotic from integrable unstable spin dynamics.

TI Interplay Between Security, Privacy and Trust in 6G-Enabled Intelligent
   Transportation Systems
SO IEEE OPEN JOURNAL OF INTELLIGENT TRANSPORTATION SYSTEMS
AB Advancements in sixth-generation (6G) wireless technology are expected to transform the transportation sector by enabling faster, more reliable, and more intelligent mobility services. 6G-enabled Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) offer ultra-low-latency communication, massive connectivity, and advanced analytics that support safer, more efficient, and more sustainable mobility. Despite these benefits, 6G-ITS introduces significant security, privacy, and trust challenges that must be addressed to ensure safe deployment and sustained public confidence. This paper reviews the opportunities and challenges of 6G-ITS with a focus on security, privacy, and trust, including the dual role of quantum technologies that strengthen cryptographic mechanisms while introducing novel attack surfaces. The paper highlights the benefits of 6G for transportation, including improved communication performance, enhanced device interoperability, advanced data analytics, and increased automation across transportation management and communication systems. A taxonomy of attack models in 6G-ITS is provided, alongside a comparison of security threats in 5G-ITS and 6G-ITS and corresponding mitigation strategies. The findings highlight the need for a comprehensive, multi-layered security framework that spans physical infrastructure, network protocols, data management, application security, and trust mechanisms to ensure the integrity and resilience of future 6G transportation ecosystems.

TI Optically addressable spin defects coupled to bound states in the
   continuum metasurfaces
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Van der Waals (vdW) materials, including hexagonal boron nitride (hBN), are layered crystalline solids with appealing properties for investigating light-matter interactions at the nanoscale. hBN has emerged as a versatile building block for nanophotonic structures, and the recent identification of native optically addressable spin defects has opened up exciting possibilities in quantum technologies. However, these defects exhibit relatively low quantum efficiencies and a broad emission spectrum, limiting potential applications. Optical metasurfaces present a novel approach to boost light emission efficiency, offering remarkable control over light-matter coupling at the sub-wavelength regime. Here, we propose and realise a monolithic scalable integration between intrinsic spin defects in hBN metasurfaces and high quality (Q) factor resonances, exceeding 102, leveraging quasi-bound states in the continuum (qBICs). Coupling between defect ensembles and qBIC resonances delivers a 25-fold increase in photoluminescence intensity, accompanied by spectral narrowing to below 4 nm linewidth and increased narrowband spin-readout efficiency. Our findings demonstrate a new class of metasurfaces for spin-defect-based technologies and pave the way towards vdW-based nanophotonic devices with enhanced efficiency and sensitivity for quantum applications in imaging, sensing, and light emission.
   Previous research reported enhanced emission from spin defects in hBN by coupling to optical resonators; however, this approach has limited scalability. Here the authors use a monolithic metasurface featuring quasi bound states fabricated from hBN to enhance photoemission and optical spin-readout efficiency of defects in the same material.

TI Exploiting Organometallic Chemistry to Functionalize Small Cuprous Oxide
   Colloidal Nanocrystals
SO JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN CHEMICAL SOCIETY
AB The ligand chemistry of colloidal semiconductor nanocrystals mediates their solubility, band gap, and surface facets. Here, selective organometallic chemistry is used to prepare small, colloidal cuprous oxide nanocrystals and to control their surface chemistry by decorating them with metal complexes. The strategy is demonstrated using small (3-6 nm) cuprous oxide (Cu2O) colloidal nanocrystals (NC), soluble in organic solvents. Organometallic complexes are coordinated by reacting the surface Cu-OH bonds with organometallic reagents, M(C6F5)(2), M = Zn(II) and Co(II), at room temperature. These reactions do not disrupt the Cu2O crystallinity or nanoparticle size; rather, they allow for the selective coordination of a specific metal complex at the surface. Subsequently, the surface-coordinated organometallic complex is reacted with three different carboxylic acids to deliver Cu-O-Zn(O2CR') complexes. Selective nanocrystal surface functionalization is established using spectroscopy (IR, F-19 NMR), thermal gravimetric analyses (TGA), transmission electron microscopy (TEM, EELS), and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). Photoluminescence efficiency increases dramatically upon organometallic surface functionalization relative to that of the parent Cu2O NC, with the effect being most pronounced for Zn(II) decoration. The nanocrystal surfaces are selectively functionalized by both organic ligands and well-defined organometallic complexes; this synthetic strategy may be applicable to many other metal oxides, hydroxides, and semiconductors. In the future, it should allow NC properties to be designed for applications including catalysis, sensing, electronics, and quantum technologies.

TI Waveguide-Integrated Two-Dimensional Material Photodetectors in
   Thin-Film Lithium Niobate
SO ADVANCED PHOTONICS RESEARCH
AB Thin-film lithium niobate on insulator (LNOI) is a promising platform for optical communications, microwave photonics, and quantum technologies. While many high-performance devices like electro-optic modulators and frequency comb sources have been achieved on LNOI platform, it remains challenging to realize photodetectors (PDs) on LNOI platform using simple and low-cost fabrication techniques. 2D materials are excellent candidates to achieve photodetection since they feature strong light-matter interaction, excellent mechanical flexibility, and potential large-scale complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor-compatible fabrication. Herein, this demand is addressed using an LNOI-2D material platform, and two types of high-performance LNOI waveguide-integrated 2D material PDs, namely graphene and tellurium (Te), are addressed. Specifically, the LNOI-graphene PDs feature broadband operations at telecom and visible wavelengths, high normalized photocurrent-to-dark current ratios up to 3 x 10(6) W-1, and large 3-dB photoelectric bandwidths of approximate to 40 GHz, simultaneously. The LNOI-Te PDs on the other hand provide ultrahigh responsivities of 7 A W-1 under 0.5 V bias for telecom signals while supporting GHz frequency responses. The results show that the versatile properties of 2D materials and their excellent compatibility with LNOI waveguides could provide important low-cost solutions for system operating point monitoring and high-speed photoelectric conversion in future LNOI photonic integrated circuits.

TI Tuning lower dimensional superconductivity with hybridization at a
   superconducting-semiconducting interface
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB The influence of interface electronic structure is vital to control lower dimensional superconductivity and its applications to gated superconducting electronics, and superconducting layered heterostructures. Lower dimensional superconductors are typically synthesized on insulating substrates to reduce interfacial driven effects that destroy superconductivity and delocalize the confined wavefunction. Here, we demonstrate that the hybrid electronic structure formed at the interface between a lead film and a semiconducting and highly anisotropic black phosphorus substrate significantly renormalizes the superconductivity in the lead film. Using ultra-low temperature scanning tunneling microscopy and spectroscopy, we characterize the renormalization of lead's quantum well states, its superconducting gap, and its vortex structure which show strong anisotropic characteristics. Density functional theory calculations confirm that the renormalization of superconductivity is driven by hybridization at the interface which modifies the confinement potential and imprints the anisotropic characteristics of the semiconductor substrate on selected regions of the Fermi surface of lead. Using an analytical model, we link the modulated superconductivity to an anisotropy that selectively tunes the superconducting order parameter in reciprocal space. These results illustrate that interfacial hybridization can be used to tune superconductivity in quantum technologies based on lower dimensional superconducting electronics.

TI 3D-Mapping and Manipulation of Photocurrent in an Optoelectronic Diamond
   Device
SO ADVANCED MATERIALS
AB Establishing connections between material impurities and charge transport properties in emerging electronic and quantum materials, such as wide-bandgap semiconductors, demands new diagnostic methods tailored to these unique systems. Many such materials host optically-active defect centers which offer a powerful in situ characterization system, but one that typically relies on the weak spin-electric field coupling to measure electronic phenomena. In this work, charge-state sensitive optical microscopy is combined with photoelectric detection of an array of nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers to directly image the flow of charge carriers inside a diamond optoelectronic device, in 3D and with temporal resolution. Optical control is used to change the charge state of background impurities inside the diamond on-demand, resulting in drastically different current flow such as filamentary channels nucleating from specific, defective regions of the device. Conducting channels that control carrier flow, key steps toward optically reconfigurable, wide-bandgap optoelectronics are then engineered using light. This work might be extended to probe other wide-bandgap semiconductors (SiC, GaN) relevant to present and emerging electronic and quantum technologies.
   Electrical currents flowing inside diamond are detected in three dimensions using the charge state of nitrogen-vacancy (NV) defects, which act as a trip-wire detector for hole current. Time-resolved imaging and direct measurement of photocurrent is combined with optical engineering of nitrogen impurities to reveal the complex dynamics of charge transport in a wide-bandgap semiconductor. image

TI Quantum control and Berry phase of electron spins in rotating levitated
   diamonds in high vacuum
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Levitated diamond particles in high vacuum with internal spin qubits have been proposed for exploring macroscopic quantum mechanics, quantum gravity, and precision measurements. The coupling between spins and particle rotation can be utilized to study quantum geometric phase, create gyroscopes and rotational matter-wave interferometers. However, previous efforts in levitated diamonds struggled with vacuum level or spin state readouts. To address these gaps, we fabricate an integrated surface ion trap with multiple stabilization electrodes. This facilitates on-chip levitation and, for the first time, optically detected magnetic resonance measurements of a nanodiamond levitated in high vacuum. The internal temperature of our levitated nanodiamond remains moderate at pressures below 10-5 Torr. We have driven a nanodiamond to rotate up to 20 MHz (1.2 x 109 rpm), surpassing typical nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center electron spin dephasing rates. Using these NV spins, we observe the effect of the Berry phase arising from particle rotation. In addition, we demonstrate quantum control of spins in a rotating nanodiamond. These results mark an important development in interfacing mechanical rotation with spin qubits, expanding our capacity to study quantum phenomena.
   Levitated nanodiamonds containing NV centers promise applications in quantum technologies, but they require experiments in high vacuum. Here the authors report on-chip levitation of nanodiamonds in high vacuum using a surface ion trap, showing spin read-out and fast rotation above NV center spin dephasing time.

TI Extending Spin Dephasing Time of Perfectly Aligned Nitrogen-Vacancy
   Centers by Mitigating Stress Distribution on Highly Misoriented
   Chemical-Vapor-Deposition Diamond
SO ADVANCED QUANTUM TECHNOLOGIES
AB Extending the spin-dephasing time (T-2(*)) of perfectly aligned nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in large-volume chemical vapor deposition (CVD) diamonds leads to enhanced DC magnetic sensitivity. However, T-2(*) of the NV centers is significantly reduced by the stress distribution in the diamond film as its thickness increases. To overcome this issue, we developed a method to mitigate the stress distribution in the CVD diamond films, leading to a T-2(*) extension of the ensemble NV centers. CVD diamond films of approximate to 60 mu m thickness with perfectly aligned NV centers are formed on (111) diamond substrates with misorientation angles of 2.0 degrees, 3.7 degrees, 5.0 degrees, and 10.0 degrees. The study found that T-2(*) of the ensemble of NV centers increased to approach its value limited only by the electron and nuclear spin bath with increasing the misorientation angle. Microscopic stress imaging revealed that the stress distribution was highly inhomogeneous along the depth direction in the CVD diamond film at low misorientation angles, whereas the inhomogeneity was largely suppressed on highly misoriented substrates. The reduced stress distribution possibly originates from the reduction of the dislocation density in the CVD diamond. This study provides an important method for synthesizing high-quality diamond materials for use in highly sensitive quantum sensors.

TI Symmetry of the Hyperfine and Quadrupole Interactions of Boron Vacancies
   in a Hexagonal Boron Nitride
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY C
AB The concept of optically addressable spin states of deep-level defects in wide band gap materials is successfully applied for the development of quantum technologies. Recently discovered negatively charged boron vacancy defects (VB-) in hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) potentially allow a transfer of this concept onto atomic-thin layers due to the van der Waals nature of the defect host. Here, we experimentally explore all terms of the VB- spin Hamiltonian reflecting interactions with the three nearest nitrogen atoms by means of conventional electron spin resonance and high frequency (94 GHz) electron-nuclear double resonance. We establish symmetry, aniso-tropy, and principal values of the corresponding hyperfine interaction (HFI) and nuclear quadrupole interaction (NQI). The HFI can be expressed in the axially symmetric form as A perpendicular to = 45.5 +/- 0.9 MHz and A parallel to = 87 +/- 0.5 MHz, while the NQI is characterized by quadrupole coupling constant Cq = 1.96 +/- 0.05 MHz with slight rhombisity parameter eta = (Pxx - Pyy)/Pzz = -0.070 +/- 0.005. Utilizing a conventional approach based on a linear combination of atomic orbitals and HFI values measured here, we reveal that almost all spin density (approximate to 84%) of the VB- electron spin is localized on the three nearest nitrogen atoms. Our findings serve as valuable spectroscopic data and direct experimental demonstration of the VB- spin localization in a single two-dimensional BN layer.

TI Scalable Etch-Free Transfer of Low-Dimensional Materials From Metal
   Films to Diverse Substrates
SO ADVANCED MATERIALS INTERFACES
AB Low-dimensional materials hold great promises for exploring emergent physical phenomena, nanoelectronics, and quantum technologies. Their synthesis often depends on catalytic metal films, from which the synthesized materials must be transferred to insulating substrates to enable device functionality and minimize interfacial interactions during quantum investigations. Conventional transfer methods, such as chemical etching or electrochemical delamination, degrade material quality, limit scalability, or prove incompatible with complex device architectures. Here, a scalable, etch-free transfer technique is presented, employing Field's metal (51% In, 32.5% Bi, and 16.5% Sn by weight) as a low-melting-point mechanical support to gently delaminate low-dimensional materials from metal films without causing damage. Anchoring the metal film during separation prevents tearing and preserves material integrity. As a proof of concept, atomically precise graphene nanoribbons (GNRs) are transferred from Au(111)/mica to dielectric substrates, including silicon dioxide (SiO2) and single-crystalline lanthanum oxychloride (LaOCl). Comprehensive characterization confirms the preservation of structural and chemical integrity throughout the transfer process. Wafer-scale compatibility and device integration are demonstrated by fabricating GNR-based field-effect transistors (GNRFETs) that exhibit room-temperature switching with on/off current ratios exceeding 103. This method provides a scalable and versatile platform for integrating low-dimensional materials into advanced low-dimensional materials-based technologies.

TI Isotope Substitution and Polytype Control for Point Defects
   Identification: The Case of the Ultraviolet Color Center in Hexagonal
   Boron Nitride
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW X
AB Defects in crystals can have a transformative effect on the properties and functionalities of solid-state systems. Dopants in semiconductors are core components in electronic and optoelectronic devices. The control of single color centers is at the basis of advanced applications for quantum technologies. Unintentional defects can also be detrimental to the crystalline structure and hinder the development of novel materials. Whatever the research perspective, the identification of defects is a key, but complicated, and often long-standing issue. Here, we present a general methodology to identify point defects by combining isotope substitution and polytype control, with a systematic comparison between experiments and first-principles calculations. We apply this methodology to hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) and its ubiquitous color center emitting in the ultraviolet spectral range. From isotopic purification of the host h-BN matrix, a local vibrational mode of the defect is uncovered, and isotope-selective carbon doping proves that this mode belongs to a carbon-based center. Then, by varying the stacking sequence of the host h-BN matrix, we unveil different optical responses to hydrostatic pressure for the nonequivalent configurations of this ultraviolet color center. We conclude that this defect is a carbon dimer in the honeycomb lattice of h-BN. Our results show that tuning the stacking sequence in different polytypes of a given crystal provides unique fingerprints contributing to the identification of defects in 2D materials.

TI Blue Quantum Emitter in Hexagonal Boron Nitride and a Carbon Chain
   Tetramer: a First-Principles Study
SO ACS APPLIED NANO MATERIALS
AB Single-photon emitters in hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) exhibit compelling optical properties, such as high brightness and photostability, making them promising candidates for applications in emerging nanophotonic and quantum technologies. However, their further progress would greatly benefit from the identification of their chemical nature, which in most cases is still under debate. Among the various emitters observed in h-BN, blue quantum emitters (435 nm), also known as B-centers, are unique not only due to their promising optical properties but also because they can be fabricated at specific locations via electron-beam irradiation. Herein, ab initio calculations are used to demonstrate that the properties of a carbon chain tetramer are in excellent agreement with the characteristics of blue quantum emitters. The calculated zero-phonon line (ZPL) energy (3.13 eV) and radiative lifetime (1.62 ns) of the carbon chain tetramer align well with experimental observations. The relatively weak electron-phonon coupling indicates intense emission at the ZPL, and the Debye-Waller factor of 0.25 is consistent with experimental data. We demonstrate that, despite the absence of an inversion center in the carbon chain tetramer, it exhibits a negligible linear Stark effect, consistent with experimental findings. Additionally, our hypothesis explains the experimental observation that the formation of blue emitters is only possible in samples containing numerous ultraviolet emitters, which are probably identical to carbon dimers.

TI Routing Challenges and Enabling Technologies for 6G-Satellite Network
   Integration: Toward Seamless Global Connectivity
SO TECHNOLOGIES
AB The capabilities of 6G networks surpass those of existing networks, aiming to enable seamless connectivity between all entities and users at any given time. A critical aspect of achieving enhanced and ubiquitous mobile broadband, as promised by 6G networks, is merging satellite networks with land-based networks, which offers significant potential in terms of coverage area. Advanced routing techniques in next-generation network technologies, particularly when incorporating terrestrial and non-terrestrial networks, are essential for optimizing network efficiency and delivering promised services. However, the dynamic nature of the network, the heterogeneity and complexity of next-generation networks, and the relative distance and mobility of satellite networks all present challenges that traditional routing protocols struggle to address. This paper provides an in-depth analysis of 6G networks, addressing key enablers, technologies, commitments, satellite networks, and routing techniques in the context of 6G and satellite network integration. To ensure 6G fulfills its promises, the paper emphasizes necessary scenarios and investigates potential bottlenecks in routing techniques. Additionally, it explores satellite networks and identifies routing challenges within these systems. The paper highlights routing issues that may arise in the integration of 6G and satellite networks and offers a comprehensive examination of essential approaches, technologies, and visions required for future advancements in this area. 6G and satellite networks are associated with technical terms such as AI/ML, quantum computing, THz communication, beamforming, MIMO technology, ultra-wide band and multi-band antennas, hybrid channel models, and quantum encryption methods. These technologies will be utilized to enhance the performance, security, and sustainability of future networks.

TI A holistic understanding of optical properties in amorphous H-terminated
   Si-nanostructures: Combining TD-DFT with AIMD
SO RESULTS IN OPTICS
AB Silicon, traditionally known as an indirect band gap semiconductor, unveils intriguing properties at the nanoscale, stemming from deviations from k-conservation rules within nanostructures. In our study, we scrutinized four hydrogenated Si 0D-nanostructures-Si10H16, Si14H20, Si18H24, and Si22H28-to unravel their dynamic stability under thermal fluctuations and optical characteristics. We initiated our exploration by employing the TD-DFT framework to generate and analyze the optical properties of these geometrically optimized nanostructures. Simultaneously, we conducted ab initio molecular dynamics simulations to examine the structural robustness and thermal stability of the four structures. Leveraging the Car-Parrinello molecular dynamics approach within the Quantum ESPRESSO open software suite, we observed temperature evolution and stability differences among the nanostructures at targeted temperatures 40 and 300 K. Our subsequent investigation delved into the Turbo-Lanczos time-dependent DFT method, unraveling the optical properties and excited-state dynamics of hydrogenated Si nanostructures. The results unveiled shifts towards higher energy absorption edges E0, accompanied by alterations in the permittivity tensor, complex refractive index, oscillator strength, and reflectivity. Notably, the analysis revealed an enlarged HOMO-LUMO gap, distinctive from bulk Si. Furthermore, our models predicted the elimination of phase-dependent E1/E2 optical transition peaks in the imaginary part of the dielectric function, and a gradual decrease in the low-frequency dielectric response with increased hydrogenation of the amorphous structures. These findings underscore the promising applications of hydrogenating Si nanostructures in diverse technological domains such as optoelectronics, memristors, sensors, and quantum computing. Their tunable optical properties, size-dependent behaviors, and compatibility with existing siliconbased devices make them particularly appealing for next-generation technologies.

AB Programmable photonic integrated circuits represent an emerging technology that amalgamates photonics and electronics, paving the way for light-based information processing at high speeds and low power consumption. Programmable photonics provides a flexible platform that can be reconfigured to perform multiple tasks, thereby holding great promise for revolutionizing future optical networks and quantum computing systems. Over the past decade, there has been constant progress in developing several different architectures for realizing programmable photonic circuits that allow for realizing arbitrary discrete unitary operations with light. Here, we systematically investigate a general family of photonic circuits for realizing arbitrary unitaries based on a simple architecture that interlaces a fixed intervening layer with programmable phase shifter layers. We introduce a criterion for the intervening operator that guarantees the universality of this architecture for representing arbitrary N x N \documentclass[12pt]{minimal} \usepackage{amsmath} \usepackage{wasysym} \usepackage{amsfonts} \usepackage{amssymb} \usepackage{amsbsy} \usepackage{mathrsfs} \usepackage{upgreek} \setlength{\oddsidemargin}{-69pt} \begin{document}$$N \times N$$\end{document} unitary operators with N + 1 \documentclass[12pt]{minimal} \usepackage{amsmath} \usepackage{wasysym} \usepackage{amsfonts} \usepackage{amssymb} \usepackage{amsbsy} \usepackage{mathrsfs} \usepackage{upgreek} \setlength{\oddsidemargin}{-69pt} \begin{document}$$N+1$$\end{document} phase layers. We explore this criterion for different photonic components, including photonic waveguide lattices and meshes of directional couplers, which allows the identification of several families of photonic components that can serve as the intervening layers in the interlacing architecture.

TI X- and Ku-Band SiGe-HBT Voltage-Controlled Ring Oscillators
   for Cryogenic Applications
SO IEEE JOURNAL ON EXPLORATORY SOLID-STATE COMPUTATIONAL DEVICES AND
   CIRCUITS
AB The theory, design, and implementation of emitter-coupled logic (ECL)-based voltagecontrolled ring oscillators (R-VCOs) operating at X- and Ku-bands for cryogenic applications are presented. Five- and seven-stage R-VCOs were fabricated in a 130-nm SiGe:C BiCMOS process technology. They provide differential multi-phased local oscillator (LO) signals with a maximum time resolution of 5.4 ps and can operate at both room temperature (RT) and cryogenic temperature (CT). For designing under cryogenic conditions (6 K), the compact model HICUM/L2was extended, and the corresponding model parameters were extracted at CTs. The implemented 5-/7-stage R-VCOs offer an adjustable frequency range of 9.7-16.5 GHz (52%) and 8.4-13.3 GHz (45%), respectively, with a maximum core power dissipation of 153 and 165 mW. At 6 K, the frequency of operation can be increased up to 18 GHz, while the power dissipation increases by only 30 mW. The R-VCOs occupy a very compact active area of 0.04 and 0.12 mm(2). The phase noise of the R-VCOs at 16.5/13 GHz at an offset frequency of 10-MHz is 106.3/107.3 dBc/Hz. They provide up to 6 dBm of saturated differential output power. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time an hetero-junction bipolar transistor (HBT)-based 5-/7-stage R-VCO is being presented at X- and Ku-band that can operate under cryogenic conditions.

TI Generative machine learning with tensor networks: Benchmarks on
   near-term quantum computers
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Noisy, intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) computing devices have become an industrial reality in the last few years, and cloud-based interfaces to these devices are enabling the exploration of near-term quantum computing on a range of problems. As NISQ devices are too noisy for many of the algorithms with a known quantum advantage, discovering impactful applications for near-term devices is the subject of intense research interest. We explore a quantum-assisted machine learning (QAML) workflow using NISQ devices through the perspective of tensor networks (TNs), which offer a robust platform for designing resource-efficient and expressive machine learning models to be dispatched on quantum devices. In particular, we lay out a framework for designing and optimizing TN-based QAML models using classical techniques, and then compiling these models to be run on quantum hardware, with demonstrations for generative matrix product state (MPS) models. We put forth a generalized canonical form for MPS models that aids in compilation to quantum devices, and demonstrate greedy heuristics for compiling with a given topology and gate set that outperforms known generic methods in terms of the number of entangling gates, e.g., CNOTs, in some cases by an order of magnitude. We present an exactly solvable benchmark problem for assessing the performance of MPS QAML models and also present an application for the canonical MNIST handwritten digit dataset. The impacts of hardware topology and day-to-day experimental noise fluctuations on model performance are explored by analyzing both raw experimental counts and statistical divergences of inferred distributions. We also present parametric studies of depolarization and readout noise impacts on model performance using hardware simulators.

By varying the process parameters, MoS2 sheets are controllably synthesized in a vertical or horizontal orientation with respect to the diamond grain facets, which leads to a pronounced impact on the electronic and optoelectronic properties of the heterostructures. Raman, SEM, AFM, KPFM, and SKP analyses show the influence of the MoS2 orientation and thickness on the work function, surface potential, spatially and spectrally resolved photovoltage, and charge transfer kinetics. The aligned growth of MoS2 nanosheets and their properties are elucidated by molecular mechanics and time-dependent DFT calculations, which explain the mechanism of the assembly and the related optoelectronic effects in a straightforward way. The major switching point occurs precisely at 11 nm of the MoS2 thickness/length. The highest photoresponse of 350 meV and favorable charge transfer are observed for the vertical MoS2 arrangement on diamond, yet without a covalent bond. The results and theoretical model hint at broader implications beyond the MoS2-diamond system.

TI Fabrication of customized low-loss optical resonators by combination of
   FIB-milling and CO2 laser smoothing
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB Fabry-Perot cavities are essential tools for applications like precision metrology, optomechanics and quantum technologies. A major challenge is the creation of microscopic spherical mirror structures which allow the precise matching with the wavefront of a Gaussian beam, while providing high surface quality. We present a novel fabrication technique, enabling the creation of customized microscopic cavity mirror structures over a wide range of geometrical parameters, by combining focused ion beam (FIB) milling and CO2 laser smoothing. While FIB milling allows us to imprint features on the mirror substrate with a resolution on the nanometer scale, the application of defocused CO2 laser pulses consistently reduces remaining surface deformations down to a roughness of sigma RMS = 0.2 nm. The average deviation of the profile from a spherical shape is kept below a few nanometers. This technique enables the customized and repeatable fabrication of low loss optics on a wide range of optical substrates, including optical fibers. Thus, Fabry-Perot cavities can be fabricated with pre-defined modal volume, high finesse and tailored ellipticity. Since the structural shape of the mirror is created by FIB milling, its pixel-by-pixel nature of the writing process can be used to create arbitrary structures with resolution given by the FIB milling. At the same time, the surface quality is given by the CO2 laser smoothing processes, without degrading the FIB milled shape.

TI A survey on Cryptoagility and Agile Practices in the light of quantum
   resistance
SO INFORMATION AND SOFTWARE TECHNOLOGY
AB Context: Crypto-agility, a name that stems from agile methodologies for software development, means the ability to modify quickly and securely cryptographic algorithms in the event of a compromise. The advent of quantum computing poses existential threats to current cryptography, having the power to breach current cryptography systems. Objective: We investigated whether and to what extent agile practices for software development are suited to support crypto-agility, or not. In particular, we discuss their usefulness in the context of substituting current algorithms with quantum-resistant ones. Method: First, we analyzed the literature to define a subset of 15 agile practices potentially relevant to cryptographic software development. Then, we developed a questionnaire to assess the suitability of agile practices for obtaining crypto-agility. We performed a Web search of relevant documents about cryptoagility and quantum resistance and sent their authors the questionnaire. We also sent the questionnaire to cybersecurity officers of four Italian firms. We analyzed and discussed the responses to 32 valid questionnaires. Results: The respondents' affiliations are evenly distributed between researchers and developers. Most of them are active, or somehow active, in quantum-resistant cryptography and use agile methods. Most of the agile practices are deemed to be quite useful, or very useful to get crypto-agility, the most effective being Continuous Integration and Coding Standards; the least appreciated is Self-organizing Team. Conclusion: According to researchers and developers working in the field, the safe transition of cryptographic algorithms to quantum-resistant ones can benefit from the adoption of many agile practices. Further software engineering research is needed to integrate agile practices in more formal cryptographic software development processes.

TI Probing quantum devices with radio-frequency reflectometry
SO APPLIED PHYSICS REVIEWS
AB Many important phenomena in quantum devices are dynamic, meaning that they cannot be studied using time-averaged measurements alone. Experiments that measure such transient effects are collectively known as fast readout. One of the most useful techniques in fast electrical readout is radio-frequency reflectometry, which can measure changes in impedance (both resistive and reactive) even when their duration is extremely short, down to a microsecond or less. Examples of reflectometry experiments, some of which have been realised and others so far only proposed, include projective measurements of qubits and Majorana devices for quantum computing, real-time measurements of mechanical motion and detection of non-equilibrium temperature fluctuations. However, all of these experiments must overcome the central challenge of fast readout: the large mismatch between the typical impedance of quantum devices (set by the resistance quantum) and of transmission lines (set by the impedance of free space). Here, we review the physical principles of radio-frequency reflectometry and its close cousins, measurements of radio-frequency transmission and emission. We explain how to optimise the speed and sensitivity of a radio-frequency measurement, and how to incorporate new tools such as superconducting circuit elements and quantum-limited amplifiers into advanced radio-frequency experiments. Our aim is three-fold: to introduce the readers to the technique, to review the advances to date and to motivate new experiments in fast quantum device dynamics. Our intended audience includes experimentalists in the field of quantum electronics who want to implement radio-frequency experiments or improve them, together with physicists in related fields who want to understand how the most important radio-frequency measurements work.

TI Nonlinear amplitude inversion using a hybrid quantum genetic algorithm
   and the exact zoeppritz equation
SO PETROLEUM SCIENCE
AB The amplitude versus offset/angle (AVO/AVA) inversion which recovers elastic properties of subsurface media is an essential tool in oil and gas exploration. In general, the exact Zoeppritz equation has a relatively high accuracy in modelling the reflection coefficients. However, amplitude inversion based on it is highly nonlinear, thus, requires nonlinear inversion techniques like the genetic algorithm (GA) which has been widely applied in seismology. The quantum genetic algorithm (QGA) is a variant of the GA that enjoys the advantages of quantum computing, such as qubits and superposition of states. It, however, suffers from limitations in the areas of convergence rate and escaping local minima. To address these shortcomings, in this study, we propose a hybrid quantum genetic algorithm (HQGA) that combines a self-adaptive rotating strategy, and operations of quantum mutation and catastrophe. While the self-adaptive rotating strategy improves the flexibility and efficiency of a quantum rotating gate, the operations of quantum mutation and catastrophe enhance the local and global search abilities, respectively. Using the exact Zoeppritz equation, the HQGA was applied to both synthetic and field seismic data inversion and the results were compared to those of the GA and QGA. A number of the synthetic tests show that the HQGA requires fewer searches to converge to the global solution and the inversion results have generally higher accuracy. The application to field data reveals a good agreement between the inverted parameters and real logs. (C) 2021 The Authors. Publishing services by Elsevier B.V. on behalf of KeAi Communications Co.

TI Evolution of Artificial Intelligence-Based OT Cybersecurity Models in
   Energy Infrastructures: Services, Technical Means, Facilities and
   Algorithms
SO ENERGIES
AB Critical energy infrastructures (CEIs) are fundamental pillars for economic and social development. However, their accelerated digitalization and the convergence between operational technologies (OTs) and information technologies (ITs) have increased their exposure to advanced cyber threats. This study examines the evolution of OT cybersecurity models with artificial intelligence in the energy sector between 2015 and 2024, through a systematic literature review following a four-phase method (planning, development, results, and analysis). To this end, we answer the following questions about the aspects of CEI cybersecurity models: What models exist? What energy services, technical means, and facilities do they encompass? And what algorithms do they include? From an initial set of 1195 articles, 52 studies were selected, which allowed us to identify 49 cybersecurity models classified into seven functional categories: detection, prediction and explanation; risk management; regulatory compliance; collaboration; response and recovery; architecture-based protection; and simulation. These models are related to 10 energy services, 6 technical means, 10 types of critical facilities, and 15 AI algorithms applied transversally. Furthermore, the integrated and systemic relationship of these study aspects has been identified in an IT-OT cybersecurity model for CEIs. The results show a transition from conventional approaches to solutions based on machine learning, deep learning, federated learning, and blockchain. Algorithms such as CNN, RNN, DRL, XAI, and FL are highlighted, which enhance proactive detection and operational resilience. A broader coverage is also observed, ranging from power plants to smart grids. Finally, five key challenges are identified: legacy OT environments, lack of interoperability, advanced threats, emerging IIoT and quantum computing risks, and low adoption of emerging technologies.

TI Gate-controlled superconductivity and quantum interference in 300 mm
   CMOS-compatible ZrN nanostructures
SO APL MATERIALS
AB The interplay of alternative materials, large-scale integration technologies, and innovative devices plays a pivotal role on the way to fault-tolerant quantum computing. In this context, gate-controlled superconductivity (GCS) emerges as a key enabling technology, promising to advance superconducting logic and quantum electronics, complementing conventional approaches based on Josephson effects and quantum interference. Here, we demonstrate all-metallic superconducting ZrN nanostructures on silicon, fabricated entirely using a subtractive, monolithic dry-etch approach with a 300 mm CMOS-compatible process flow. For Dayem-bridge weak links with decreasing width down to 27 nm, we observe T-c of 7.3 K, width-dependent switching characteristics, and a progressive approach of the tunneling limit. In laterally gated Dayem-bridge and nanowire devices, we observe GCS with full suppression of the critical current, where required gate voltages < 5 V promise compatibility with CMOS interfaces. Asymmetries in polarity-dependent power injection via field emission support GCS models that attribute the effect to quasiparticle relaxation through phonon emission. Additional asymmetries in the GCS effect suggest an influence of the substrate condition after dry etching. Field emission features in the gated nanowire device imply superimposed current paths along the gate edge and corners. Finally, we analyze magnetic interference in Dayem-bridge weak links and superconducting quantum interference devices, where quantum interference is governed by Josephson effects and inductance loop asymmetries. Our results contribute to the scaling efforts in hybrid superconducting electronics and quantum-processing units. (c) 2025 Author(s).

TI Secure Lattice-Based Signature Scheme for Internet of Things
   Applications
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB The enormous benefits of Internet of Things (IoT) technology have driven its deployment in various applications. Additionally, the development of quantum computers has directed attention towards lattice-based cryptography. Consequently, the computational capabilities of quantum computers pose a threat to the security of the existing IoT signature mechanisms. Quantum computers are proficient at unraveling the complexity bound of computationally hard problems like the integer factorization problem (IFP) and the discrete logarithm problem (DLP). As a result, security is an essential requirement for the IoT communication network against quantum attacks. The amalgamation of certificateless public key cryptosystems (CL-PKC) and lattice-based cryptography (LBC) is one of the solution for alleviating these security menaces. Lucidly, CL-PKC prevents key escrow issues and key management problems; LBC prevents quantum attacks. The Shortest Integer Solution (SIS) problem, which the NTRU lattices offer, serves as the basis for this paper's introduction of a certificateless signature mechanism for IoT environments. By adopting the Random Oracle Model, we demonstrated the security of the suggested mechanism against Type 1 and Type 2 attackers. Furthermore, security analysis and performance evaluation demonstrate robust communication, as evidenced by metrics such as the computational cost of CL-Sign and CL-Verify phases at 536 mu s , 376.81 mu s and communication cost of KGC at 418 bits, CL-Sign at 532 bits and CL-Verify at 446 bits. Also, we calculate the cost of single-message signature generation and verification on an IoT device. These results show that the suggested mechanism's security and computational efficiency are more reliable, and efficient than other relevant competing frameworks.

TI Chiral metasurface device in near-infrared region designed by
   rectangular arrays
SO JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYSICS
AB Polarization is one of the fundamental properties of light and has an important application value, involving multiple fields, such as imaging, display, quantum computing, and biosensing. The artificial metasurface can achieve comprehensive control of electromagnetic waves, such as amplitudes, phases, and polarization states. Compared to traditional optical devices, the metasurfaces have advantages, such as small size and diverse functions, meeting the needs of modern optical systems for ultra-lightweight, ultra-compact, and multifunctional optical components. Chiral media are widely presented in various macroscopic and microscopic systems in nature. Circular dichroism (CD) is commonly used to describe the difference in absorption rates of left-handed circularly polarized light and right-handed circularly polarized light in chiral media. However, the optical response of chiral media in nature is usually weak and mainly located in the ultraviolet band, which limits their detection sensitivity and practical application range. In this work, we proposed a chiral metasurface model with four rectangular holes with proper rotation. By rotating the rectangular or elliptical holes at a certain angle, the symmetry of the structure is disrupted, making it chiral. The proposed metasurface devices were fabricated, and the optical measurements were performed, which were in good agreement with the designs. The normalized CD values are around 0.01 at the near-infrared region. This work provides a complete procedure of the metasurface device and initials chiral-tunable flat meta-devices. It also has broad application prospects in fields, such as polarization imaging, life sciences, and drug chiral detection. (c) 2024 Author(s).

TI Real-Time Measurements of Photonic Microchips with Femtometer-Scale
   Spectral Precision and Ultrahigh Sensitivity
SO LASER & PHOTONICS REVIEWS
AB Photonic integrated circuits (PICs) are enabling breakthroughs in several areas, including quantum computing, neuromorphic processors, wearable devices, and more. Nevertheless, existing PIC measurement methods lack the spectral precision, speed, and sensitivity required for refining current applications and exploring new frontiers such as point-of-care or wearable biosensors. Here, the "sweeping optical frequency mixing method (SOHO)" is presented, surpassing traditional PIC measurement methods with real-time operation, 30 dB higher sensitivity, and over 100 times better spectral resolution. Leveraging the frequency mixing process with a sweeping laser, SOHO excels in simplicity, eliminating the need for advanced optical components and additional calibration procedures. Its superior performance is demonstrated on ultrahigh-quality factor (Q) fiber-loop resonators (Q = 46 x 106), as well as microresonators, realized on a new optical waveguide platform. An experimental spectral resolution of 19.1 femtometers is demonstrated using an 85-meter-long unbalanced fiber Mach Zehnder Interferometer, constrained by noise resulting from the extended fiber length, while the theoretical resolution is calculated to be 6.2 femtometers, limited by the linewidth of the reference laser. With its excellent performance metrics, SOHO has the potential to become a vital measurement tool in photonics, excelling in high-speed and high-resolution measurements of weak optical signals.
   Here, a novel photonic integrated circuit (PIC) measurement method termed the "sweeping optical frequency mixing method (SOHO)", is introduced. It leverages the principles of optical frequency mixing by incorporating a sweeping laser, a fixed-wavelength laser, and custom control software. It surpasses the traditional PIC measurement methods with real-time operation, 30 dB higher signal-to-noise ratio, and over 100 times better spectral resolution. image

TI KMB4O6F3 (M = Co, Fe): two-dimensional
   magnetic fluorooxoborates with triangular lattices directed by
   triangular BO3 units
SO DALTON TRANSACTIONS
AB Frustrated magnetic systems are of great interest owing to their spin liquid state for application in quantum computing. However, experimentally, spin liquid has not been realized. Thus, experimental explorations of frustrated magnetic systems including triangular lattices are still urgent, particularly for directed synthesis compared to random exploration. Herein, for the first time, directed by the use of a triangular unit of the BO3 anion group, two novel layered magnetic fluorooxoborates KMB4O6F3 (M = Co 1, Fe 2) with triangular lattices have been hydrothermally synthesized and characterized. Compounds 1 and 2 are isostructural and crystallize in the P2(1)/c space group with layered magnetic triangular lattices, which are further separated by K+ ions. Magnetic susceptibility curves of both 1 and 2 show no lambda-anomaly peak down to a low temperature of 2 K in the absence of a magnetic long-range ordering transition, which are further confirmed by the heat capacity results. The magnetic-field dependence of magnetization at 2 K shows saturation of 2.20(mu B )for 1 and 4.24(mu B )for 2, respectively, at 7 T, after roughly subtracting the Van Vleck paramagnetic contribution. Further in-depth investigation of the underlying physics at a lower temperature below 2 K would be subsequently performed. Moreover, thermal stability and FT-IR and UV-vis-NIR spectroscopy with optical bandgap properties are also reported. Most importantly, our work provides a promising method to experimentally realize specific magnetic lattices (e.g. triangular lattices) directed by the use of triangular groups (e.g. BO3) as the functional unit.

TI The role of agentic AI in shaping a smart future: A systematic review
SO ARRAY
AB Artificial intelligence (AI), particularly Agentic AI, is increasingly critical for addressing the demand for speed, efficiency, and customer focus in modern organizations. However, the rapid evolution of Agentic AI, including Generative AI (GenAI) agents, has outpaced a cohesive understanding of its applications, challenges, and strategic implications. This narrative review explores the role of Agentic AI in shaping an intelligent future, focusing on its key attributes-autonomy, reactivity, proactivity, and learning ability-and its potential to transform organizational performance. We identify a research gap in synthesizing the diverse capabilities of Agentic AI (e. g., multimodal processing, hierarchical architectures, and machine learning outsourcing) and providing actionable strategies for adoption. The paper examines how Agentic AI enables autonomous decision-making, automates processes, and enhances efficiency through tools like LangChain, CrewAI, AutoGen, and AutoGPT. It highlights the transition from assisted ("Copilot") to autonomous ("Autopilot") models and the importance of hierarchical agent structures for system coordination. Key contributions include a framework for organizations to formulate GenAI strategies, addressing business needs, tool selection, human resource training, and risk management. Findings reveal that Agentic AI significantly improves productivity, reduces costs, and drives innovation, though challenges such as privacy, security, and ethical concerns remain. Future research should focus on industry-specific case studies to deepen understanding, explore the ethical and social impacts (e.g., privacy, data security, labor market effects), and investigate the integration of Agentic AI with emerging technologies like quantum computing. This review provides a foundation for researchers and practitioners to leverage Agentic AI effectively while addressing its limitations and opportunities.

TI Femtosecond Direct Laser Writing of Conductive and Electrically
   Switchable PEDOT:PSS Optical Nanostructures
SO ADVANCED OPTICAL MATERIALS
AB Microscale three-dimensional (3D)-printing, with its remarkable precision and ability to create complex structures, has transformed a wide range of applications, from micro-optics and photonics to endoscopy and quantum technologies. In these fields, miniaturization plays a crucial role in unlocking new capabilities. However, despite these advancements, most 3D-printed optical structures have remained static, lacking dynamic behavior and tunability. In this study, a novel approach is presented that combines direct laser writing with the electrically switchable optical properties of the conductive polymer poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrene sulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS). This integration facilitates the creation of dynamic structures directly on 3D-printed objects, marking a significant step toward adaptive optical devices. The fabrication of electrically tunable structures is demonstrated via direct laser writing using PEDOT:PSS on indium tin oxide (ITO)-coated glass substrates, as well as beneath and atop static 3D-printed structures. It is found that electrical conductivity as well as the greyscale behavior of PEDOT:PSS remains intact after direct laser writing. The switching speed, durability, and gradual tunability of the material are explored upon complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS)-compatible voltages ranging from -3 to +2 V. In the future, this advancement opens exciting possibilities in adaptive micro-optics, such as switchable apertures printed directly onto micro-optical lenses.

TI Optimized Lambda Exonuclease Digestion or Purification Using
   Streptavidin-Coated Beads: Which One Is Best for Successful DNA Aptamer
   Selection?
SO METHODS AND PROTOCOLS
AB The high failure rate of the in vitro aptamer selection process by SELEX (Systematic Evolution of Ligands by EXponential enrichment) limits the production of these innovative oligonucleotides and, consequently, limits their potential applications. The generation of single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) is a critical step of SELEX, directly affecting the enrichment and the selection of potential binding sequences. The main goal of this study was to confirm the best method for generating ssDNA by comparing the purification of ssDNA, using streptavidin-coated beads, and lambda exonuclease digestion, and by improving ssDNA recovery through protocol improvements. In addition, three techniques for quantifying the ssDNA generated (Qubit vs. Nanodrop (TM) vs. gel quantification) were compared, and these demonstrated the accuracy of the gel-based quantification method. Lambda exonuclease digestion was found to be more efficient for ssDNA recovery than purification using streptavidin-coated beads, both quantitatively and qualitatively. In conclusion, this work provides a detailed and rigorous protocol for generating ssDNA, improving the chances of a successful aptamer selection process.

TI Coherent Excitation of Bound Electron Quantum State With Quantum
   Electron Wavepackets
SO FRONTIERS IN PHYSICS
AB We present a fully quantum model for the excitation of a bound electron based on the "free-electron bound-electron resonant interaction" (FEBERI) scheme. The bound electron is modeled as a quantum two-level system (TLS) at any initial quantum (qubit) state, and the free electron is presented as a pre-shaped quantum electron wavepacket (QEW). In the case that the QEW is short or modulated at optical frequency, the TLS quantum state may be coherently controlled with multiple modulation-correlated QEWs. For this case, we derive the transition probability of the TLS due to interaction with a multi-particle beam based on an analytical approximate solution of the Schrodinger equation that amounts to using Born's probabilistic interpretation of the quantum electron wavefunction. We verify the credibility of the analytical model at its validity ranges using a fully quantum density matrix computation procedure. It is shown that the transition probability can grow quadratically with the number of correlated QEWs and exhibit Rabi oscillation. The study indicates a possibility of engineering the quantum state of a TLS by utilizing a beam of shaped QEWs.

   Bibliometric Analysis
SO EDUCATION SCIENCES
AB Quantum physics is an essential field of science education research, which reflects the high relevance of research on quantum physics and its technologies all around the globe. In this paper, we report on a bibliometric analysis of the science education research community's scientific output in the area of quantum physics in the period from 2000 to 2021. A total of 1520 articles published in peer-reviewed physics and science education journals were retrieved from Web of Science and Scopus databases to conduct bibliometric analysis. This study aims to provide an overview of quantum physics education research in terms of scientific production, preferred publication venues, most involved researchers and countries (including collaborations), and research topics. The main findings point to a continuous increase in research output in the field of quantum physics education over the last two decades. Furthermore, they indicate a shift regarding the research foci. While formerly mainly papers on the teaching of quantum physics content were published, recently, an increase in the relevancy of empirical studies on the teaching and learning of quantum physics can be observed.

AB This paper is dedicated to Michael J. Duff on the occasion of his 70th birthday. I discuss some issues of M-theory/string theory/supergravity closely related to Mike's interests. I describe a relation between STU black hole entropy, the Cayley hyperdeterminant, the Bhargava cube and a three-qubit Alice-Bob-Charlie triality symmetry. I shortly describe my recent work with Gunaydin, Linde and Yamada on M-theory cosmology (Gunaydin et al. 2020 M-theory cosmology, octonions, error-correcting codes (http://arxiv.org/abs/2008.01494)), inspired by the work of Duff with Ferrara and Borsten, Levay, Marrani et al. Here, we have seven-qubits, a party including Alice, Bob, Charlie, Daisy, Emma, Fred and George. Octonions and Hamming error-correcting codes are at the base of these models. They lead to seven benchmark targets of future cosmic microwave background missions looking for primordial gravitational waves from inflation. I also show puzzling relations between the fermion mass eigenvalues in these cosmological models, the exceptional Jordan eigenvalue problem and black hole entropy. The symmetry of our cosmological models is illustrated by beautiful pictures of a Coxeter projection of the root system of E7.

TI Laser assist quantum dot scattering with Gaussian potential
SO PHYSICS OPEN
AB Laser-assisted quantum dot (QD) scattering with a Gaussian potential explores the interaction of QDs with incident laser fields, influencing their scattering dynamics with several parameters. It has wide applications in quantum computing, nanophotonics, optoelectronics, precise quantum state manipulation, biosensing, medical imaging, and photovoltaics, where laser control enhances QD performance for improved efficiency and sensitivity. This study investigates the differential cross-section (DCS) in laser field with QD (dressed gaussian potential) and field free electron. This is theoretical work, to developed new model of DCS for considered system, Kroll-Watson approximation, Volko wave functions and S-matrix and T-matrix are used as theoretical tools. After the development of model different parameters are used like incidence energies (0 to 5 eV), scattering angles (0 to 60 degrees), QDsizes (0 to 10 & Aring;), and laser-dressed parameters (0 to 40 & Aring;) to study the nature of DCS, for validation of parameter's authors used secondary data from published work. The nature of developed equation was computed using MATLAB online student package. The observation shows that the DCS decrease with increasing in incident energy of electron and scattering angle while increase with QDs size as well as laser-dressed parameters. Also, the observation shows DCS for zero-order Bessel function is higher DCS than other higher order Bessel function. Additionally, the observation also shows DCS for elliptical polarization found higher than linear polarization. This shows DCS is effects by different parameters as well as assumption consider in this study. This means the system also goes effect when such QD is used in applied field as mention above. So, it is necessary to study the DCS of QD under various condition.

TI Leveraging Quantum LSTM for High-Accuracy Prediction of Viral Mutations
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB The rapid mutations of viruses such as COVID-19 pose significant challenges for vaccine development and effective disease management. In response to these challenges, this study introduces a novel quantum-enhanced LSTM (QLSTM) model designed to predict genetic mutations, specifically focusing on viral protein sequences. The QLSTM model leverages quantum computing techniques, including superposition and entanglement, to improve the model's ability to handle the high-dimensional, nonlinear structure inherent in viral genomic datasets. These quantum enhancements allow the model to capture complex relationships in the data, improving its accuracy and performance in mutation detection compared to traditional methods. To improve model predictions, we use two key preprocessing techniques TF-IDF for efficient feature extraction and PCA for dimensionality reduction of genomic sequences. TF-IDF helps the model focus on the most informative nucleotide features, while PCA reduces the size of the data, making the model computationally efficient without sacrificing important information. The one-hot encoding technique is a standard technique in machine learning for encoding protein sequences into data that can be used in neural networks.The proposed QLSTM outperformed existing deep learning architectures such as the Attention-Augmented Convolutional Neural Network (AACNN), Stacked Recurrent Neural Network (Stacked RNN), Retention Network (RetNet), and Bidirectional Long Short Term Memory (BiLSTM). These results indicate that QLSTM not only provides high accuracy in mutation predictions in SARS-CoV-2 protein sequences but also provides deep insights into the functional implications of such mutations. The model identifies mutation hotspots that affect virus spread, immune evasion, and protein structure, providing key biological insights for future vaccine development and therapeutic strategies.

TI Quantization Conductance of InSb Quantum-Well Two-Dimensional Electron
   Gas Using Novel Spilt Gate Structures
SO JOURNAL OF NANO RESEARCH
AB Electron transport behaviour in InSb semiconductor could significantly changes when the conduction is restricted to two-dimensions. Semiconductor materials are effective tools to characterize electron transport in this aspect because the energy separation between transverse modes in a low-dimensional semiconductor device are always inversely proportional to the effective mass, in the same way as for sub-bands in a parabolic potential. Therefore, in this article, a range of novel device geometries were designed, fabricated and characterized to investigate the ballistic transport of electrons in low-dimensional InSb structures using surface-gated devices to restrict the degrees of freedom (dimensionality) of the active conducting channel. In this framework, designs of gates (i.e., line, loop, and solid discussed later) have been used over a range of gate dimensions. Consistent measurement of quantized conductance would be promising for both low-power electronics and low-temperature transport physics where split gates are typically used for charge sensing. This article presents an experimental results of quantization conductance obtained for the range geometries of novel gates, and some model consideration of the implications of the material choice. Furthermore, the etching techniques (wet and dry) exhibited a significant decrease in Ohmic contact resistance from around 35 k Omega to only roughly 250 Omega at room temperature. Interestingly a possible 0.7 anomaly conduction was observed with a loop gate structure. This work showed perfectly that the two-dimensional electron gases can be formed in narrow gap InSb quantum wells (QWs) which make this configuration device a promising candidate for topological quantum computing and next-generation integrated circuit applications.

TI Critical Lengths of Kitaev Chains for Majorana Zero Modes with a
   Microsecond Coherence Time and a Quantized Conductance Signature
SO MATERIALS
AB The problems of disorder and insufficient system length are generally regarded as central problems in the realization of Majorana zero modes (MZM), which are a promising platform for realizing fault-tolerant topological quantum computing (TQC). In this work, we analyze eigenenergy spectra and transport properties of finite Kitaev chains using quantum transport simulations in a wide design space of hopping amplitude (t), superconductor pairing (Delta), and electrochemical potential. Our goal is to determine critical or minimum acceptable chain lengths to obtain oscillation-free MZMs with suitable microsecond coherence times, and observable zero-bias conductance peaks (ZBCP) quantized almost at similar to 2e(2)/h. Due to qualitative equivalence of the Kitaev and Oreg-Lutchyn models, we approximately determine the foreseeable critical length of topological superconducting nanowires (TS NWs) as well. We find that the ZBCP length requirement is looser in comparison to the limit imposed by the coherence time. For a large t/Delta mismatch of similar to 40 corresponding to the experimental TS NWs, the first condition sets the minimum length to 344 sites (approximate to 5.5 mu m), while the second condition requires 605 sites (approximate to 9.7 mu m). The calculated lengths are far from the reported experimental hybrid device dimensions, explaining difficulties in observing MZMs in TS NWs fabricated so far. Nonetheless, a decreasing t/Delta mismatch allows for shorter systems, which argues in favor of the proximitized quantum dot path for MZMs in a solid-state system.

TI Adiabatic Time Evolution of Highly Excited States
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB Adiabatic time evolution of quantum systems is a widely used tool with applications ranging from state preparation through simplifications of computations and topological transformations to optimization and quantum computing. Adiabatic time evolution generally works well for gapped ground states, but not for thermal states in the middle of the spectrum that lack a protecting energy gap. Here we show that quantum many-body scars-a particular type of highly excited states-are suitable for adiabatic time evolution despite the absence of a protecting energy gap. Considering two rather different models, namely a one-dimensional model constructed from tensor networks and a two-dimensional fractional quantum Hall model with anyons, we find that the quantum scars perform similarly to gapped ground states with respect to adiabatic dynamics when the required final adiabatic fidelity is around 0.99. The maximum speed at which the scar state of the one-dimensional model can be adiabatically transformed decreases as a power law with system size, as opposed to exponentially for both generic thermal and disorder-driven localized states. At constant and very low ramp speed, we find that the deviation of the fidelity from unity scales linearly with ramp speed for scar states, but quadratically for gapped ground states. The gapped ground states hence perform better when the required adiabatic fidelities are very high, such as 0.9999 and above. We identify two mechanisms for leakage out of the scar state and use them to explain our results. While manipulating a single, isolated ground state is common in quantum applications, adiabatic evolution of scar states provides the flexibility to manipulate an entire tower of ground-state-like states simultaneously in a single system.

TI Preparation and characterization of SbSeI thin films
SO JOURNAL OF SCIENCE-ADVANCED MATERIALS AND DEVICES
AB Metal chalcohalides are promising candidates for next-generation technologies that include energy conversion, information storage, and quantum computing. Among them, antimony selenoiodide (SbSeI) has received rising interest for different optoelectronic devices, including photovoltaics, due to its bandgap energy, strong optical absorption, stability, and earth abundant, low-cost, and low toxicity constituents. In this work, SbSeI thin films were prepared through a two-step process. At first, antimony selenide (Sb2Se3) thin films were deposited at 300 degrees C (Sb2Se3-300) and at room temperature (Sb2Se3-RT) onto molybdenum covered soda-lime glass substrates by a magnetron sputtering method. The formation of SbSeI thin films was performed by isothermally annealing the as-deposited Sb2Se3 thin films in sealed quartz ampoules in the atmosphere of antimony iodide (SbI3) with the presence of 100 Torr of argon pressure. The influence of the annealing temperature and time during the iodization of different types of substrates on the morphology and composition of SbSeI thin films was investigated. The well-oriented and dense single-phase SbSeI thin films with stoichiometric composition and single-crystal micro-columnar structures were achieved by annealing Sb2Se3-RT in SbI3 atmosphere at 250 degrees C for 5 min under 100 Torr of Ar pressure. The room temperature photoluminescence (RT-PL) of SbSeI exhibited a broad asymmetric PL band with a maximum at 1.67 eV. The low-temperature (T = 8 K) PL study of SbSeI showed a broad and asymmetric PL band at 1.4 eV, being quite distant from the bandgap. This PL band at 1.4 eV with obtained small thermal quenching activation energy of 12.7 meV is proposed to originate from the deep donor-deep acceptor pair (DD-DA) recombination.

TI QBIoT: A Quantum Blockchain Framework for IoT with an Improved
   Proof-of-Authority Consensus Algorithm and a Public-Key Quantum
   Signature
SO CMC-COMPUTERS MATERIALS & CONTINUA
AB The Internet of Things (IoT) is a network system that connects physical devices through the Internet, allowing them to interact. Nowadays, IoT has become an integral part of our lives, offering convenience and smart functionality. However, the growing number of IoT devices has brought about a corresponding increase in cybersecurity threats, such as device vulnerabilities, data privacy concerns, and network susceptibilities. Integrating blockchain technology with IoT has proven to be a promising approach to enhance IoT security. Nevertheless, the emergence of quantum computing poses a significant challenge to the security of traditional classical cryptography used in blockchain, potentially exposing it to quantum cyber-attacks. To support the growth of the IoT industry, mitigate quantum threats, and safeguard IoT data, this study proposes a robust blockchain solution for IoT that incorporates both classical and post-quantum security measures. Firstly, we present the Quantum-Enhanced Blockchain Architecture for IoT (QBIoT) to ensure secure data sharing and integrity protection. Secondly, we propose an improved Proof of Authority consensus algorithm called "Proof of Authority with Random Election" (PoARE), implemented within QBIoT for leader selection and new block creation. Thirdly, we develop a public- key quantum signature protocol for transaction verification in the blockchain. Finally, a comprehensive security analysis of QBIoT demonstrates its resilience against cyber threats from both classical and quantum adversaries. In summary, this research introduces an innovative quantum-enhanced blockchain solution to address quantum security concerns within the realm of IoT. The proposed QBIoT framework contributes to the ongoing development of quantum blockchain technology and offers valuable insights for future research on IoT security.

TI Dynamics of decoherence in a noisy driven environment
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB We analyze the decoherence dynamics of a central spin coupled to a spin chain with a time-dependent noisy magnetic field, focusing on how noise influences the system's decoherence. Our results show that decoherence due to the nonequilibrium critical dynamics of the environment is amplified in the presence of uncorrelated and correlated Gaussian noise. We demonstrate that decoherence factor consistently signals the critical points, and exhibits exponential scaling with the system size, the square of noise intensity, and the noise correlation time at the critical points. We find that strong coupling between the qubit and the environment leads to partial revivals of decoherence, which diminish with increasing noise intensity or decreasing noise correlation time. In contrast, weak coupling leads to monotonic enhanced decoherence. The numerical results illustrate that, the revivals decay and scale exponentially with noise intensity. Moreover, the revivals increase and indicate linear or power law scaling with noise correlation time depending on how the correlated noise is fast or slow. Additionally, we explore the non-Markovianity of the dynamics, finding that it decays in the presence of noise but increases as the noise correlation time grows.

TI Quantum and Data Signals in a Single Fiber-Multiplexing by Smart Use of
   High-Grade Filters
SO IEEE COMMUNICATIONS LETTERS
AB In this letter, we present the latest findings in coexistence of two rather different classes of optical signals in one fiber - classical data signals and quantum signals. The most significant and notable difference between the two is the optical power, which is several orders (7 or more) of magnitude distinct from each other. There are several approaches to address this issue - in this letter, at a glance, the realistic and practical approach, which relies on the selection of high-grade optical filters, was chosen. Rigorous, however affordable, optical filtering is required to avoid any possible crosstalk, not only from the classical data signals but also from the spontaneous nonlinear Raman scattering effect. In our experimental verification, it has been demonstrated that the selection of high-grade transmission components is a crucial element in the success of multiplexing strong and weak optical signals in a single fiber. In real-world applications, this approach significantly reduces infrastructure costs by eliminating the need for additional fiber.

TI Variational Monte Carlo with large patched transformers
SO COMMUNICATIONS PHYSICS
AB Large language models, like transformers, have recently demonstrated immense powers in text and image generation. This success is driven by the ability to capture long-range correlations between elements in a sequence. The same feature makes the transformer a powerful wavefunction ansatz that addresses the challenge of describing correlations in simulations of qubit systems. Here we consider two-dimensional Rydberg atom arrays to demonstrate that transformers reach higher accuracies than conventional recurrent neural networks for variational ground state searches. We further introduce large, patched transformer models, which consider a sequence of large atom patches, and show that this architecture significantly accelerates the simulations. The proposed architectures reconstruct ground states with accuracies beyond state-of-the-art quantum Monte Carlo methods, allowing for the study of large Rydberg systems in different phases of matter and at phase transitions. Our high-accuracy ground state representations at reasonable computational costs promise new insights into general large-scale quantum many-body systems.
   Ground state representations with artificial neural network methods enable high-accuracy simulations of quantum many-body systems. The authors study the performance of the transformer network architecture on this task and demonstrate its vast potential for novel findings in quantum physics.

TI Nodes and Spin Windings for Topological Transitions in Light-Matter
   Interactions
SO ADVANCED QUANTUM TECHNOLOGIES
AB The anisotropic quantum Rabi model (QRM) is the fundamental model of light-matter interactions with indispensable counter-rotating terms in ultra-strong couplings. By extracting different levels of topological information a new light is shed on the energy spectrum of the anisotropic QRM. Besides conventional topological transitions (TTs) at gap closing, abundant unconventional TTs are unveiled underlying level anticrossings without gap closing by tracking the wave-function nodes, including a particular unconventional TT which turns out to be universal for different energy levels. On the other hand, it is found that the nodes have a correspondence to spin windings, which not only endows the nodes a more explicit topological character in supporting single-qubit TTs but also turns the topological information physically detectable. Furthermore, hidden small-spin-knot transitions are exposed for the ground state, while more kinds of spin-knot transitions emerge in excited states including unmatched node numbers and spin winding numbers. Based on node sorting, algebraic formulation is established to decode the topological information encoded geometrically in the wave functions and spin windings.

TI Probing sign structure using measurement-induced entanglement
SO QUANTUM
AB The sign structure of quantum states is closely connected to quantum phases of matter, yet detecting such fine-grained properties of amplitudes is subtle. Here we employ as a diagnostic measurement -induced entanglement (MIE)??? the average entanglement generated between two par-ties after measuring the rest of the system. We propose that for a sign-free state, the MIE upon measuring in the sign-free ba-sis decays no slower than correlations in the state before measurement. Concretely, we prove that MIE is upper bounded by mutual information for sign-free stabilizer states (essentially CSS codes), which es-tablishes a bound between scaling dimen-sions of conformal field theories describ-ing measurement-induced critical points in stabilizer systems. We also show that for sign-free qubit wavefunctions, MIE be-tween two qubits is upper bounded by a simple two-point correlation function, and we verify our proposal in several criti-cal ground states of one-dimensional sys-tems, including the transverse field and tri-critical Ising models. In contrast, for states with sign structure, such bounds can be violated, as we illustrate in critical hy-brid circuits involving both Haar or Clif-ford random unitaries and measurements, and gapless symmetry-protected topologi-cal states.

TI Binding Sites, Vibrations and Spin-Lattice Relaxation Times in
   Europium(II)-Based Metallofullerene Spin Qubits
SO CHEMISTRY-A EUROPEAN JOURNAL
AB To design molecular spin qubits with enhanced quantum coherence, a control of the coupling between the local vibrations and the spin states is crucial, which could be realized in principle by engineering molecular structures via coordination chemistry. To this end, understanding the underlying structural factors that govern the spin relaxation is a central topic. Here, we report the investigation of the spin dynamics in a series of chemically designed europium(II)-based endohedral metallofullerenes (EMFs). By introducing a unique structural difference, i. e. metal-cage binding site, while keeping other molecular parameters constant between different complexes, these manifest the key role of the three low-energy metal-displacing vibrations in mediating the spin-lattice relaxation times (T-1). The temperature dependence of T-1 can thus be normalized by the frequencies of these low energy vibrations to show an unprecedentedly universal behavior for EMFs in frozen CS2 solution. Our theoretical analysis indicates that this structural difference determines not only the vibrational rigidity but also spin-vibration coupling in these EMF-based qubit candidates.

TI Thermal release tape-assisted semiconductor membrane transfer process
   for hybrid photonic devices embedding quantum emitters
SO MATERIALS FOR QUANTUM TECHNOLOGY
AB The ability to combine different materials enables a combination of complementary properties and device engineering that cannot be found or exploited within a single material system. In the realm of quantum nanophotonics, one might want to increase device functionality by, for instance, combining efficient classical and quantum light emission available in III-V semiconductors, low-loss light propagation accessible in silicon-based materials, fast electro-optical properties of lithium niobate, and broadband reflectors and/or buried metallic contacts for local electric field application or electrical injection of emitters. However, combining different materials on a single wafer is challenging and may result in low reproducibility and/or low yield. For instance, direct epitaxial growth requires crystal lattice matching for producing of defect-free films, and wafer bonding requires considerable and costly process development for high bond strength and yield. We propose a transfer printing technique based on the removal of arrays of free-standing membranes and their deposition onto a host material using a thermal release adhesive tape-assisted process. This approach is versatile, in that it poses limited restrictions on the transferred and host materials. In particular, we transfer 190 nm-thick GaAs membranes that contain InAs quantum dots and which have dimensions up to about 260 mu m x 80 mu m onto a gold-coated silicon substrate. We show that the presence of a back reflector combined with the etching of micropillars significantly increases the extraction efficiency of quantum light from a single quantum dot line, reaching photon fluxes exceeding 8 x 10(5) photons per second. This flux is four times higher than the highest count rates measured from emitters outside the pillars on the same chip. Given its versatility and ease of processing, this technique provides a path to realising hybrid quantum nanophotonic devices that combine virtually any material in which free-standing membranes can be made onto any host substrate, without specific compatibility issues and/or requirements.

TI Manganese doping for enhanced magnetic brightening and circular
   polarization control of dark excitons in paramagnetic layered hybrid
   metal-halide perovskites
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Materials combining semiconductor functionalities with spin control are desired for the advancement of quantum technologies. Here, we study the magneto-optical properties of novel paramagnetic Ruddlesden-Popper hybrid perovskites Mn:(PEA)(2)PbI4 (PEA=phenethylammonium) and report magnetically brightened excitonic luminescence with strong circular polarization from the interaction with isolated Mn2+ ions. Using a combination of superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID) magnetometry, magneto-absorption and transient optical spectroscopy, we find that a dark exciton population is brightened by state mixing with the bright excitons in the presence of a magnetic field. Unexpectedly, the circular polarization of the dark exciton luminescence follows the Brillouin-shaped magnetization with a saturation polarization of 13% at 4K and 6T. From high-field transient magneto-luminescence we attribute our observations to spin-dependent exciton dynamics at early times after excitation, with first indications for a Mn-mediated spin-flip process. Our findings demonstrate manganese doping as a powerful approach to control excitonic spin physics in Ruddlesden-Popper perovskites, which will stimulate research on this highly tuneable material platform with promise for tailored interactions between magnetic moments and excitonic states. Combining magnetic and semiconducting properties in a single material offers great technological potential, all the more so if these are coupled with good optical properties. Here, Neumann et al. present a Manganese doped Ruddlesden-Popper perovskite with this trifecta of attributes.

TI Ultrastable optical frequency transfer and attosecond timing in deployed
   multicore fiber
SO OPTICA
AB The telecommunications industry's deployment of billions of kilometers of optical fiber has created a vast global network that can be exploited for additional applications such as environmental sensing, quantum networking, and international clock comparisons. However, for reasons such as the unidirectionality of long-haul fiber links, telecom fiber networks cannot always be adapted for important applications beyond data transmission. Fortunately, new multicore optical fibers create the opportunity for application coexistence with data traffic, creating multifunctional networks. Toward that end, we propose and demonstrate the faithful transfer of ultrastable optical signals through deployed multicore fiber in a way that is compatible with the unidirectionality of long-haul fiber optic systems, demonstrating fractional frequency instability of 3 x 10-19 at 10,000 s. By supporting state-of-the-art optical atomic clocks, subsea multicore fibers can break the distance barrier for ultrastable optical frequency transfer, opening the door to intercontinental optical clock comparisons at the highest level, with applications in fundamental physics, relativistic geodesy, and the redefinition of the second.

TI High extinction-ratio thin-film lithium niobate modulator integrated
   with TE-pass waveguide polarizer
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB Thin-film lithium niobate (TFLN) modulators are expected to play a key role in next- generation optical communication systems. In this work, we present the design, fabrication, and characterization of a TFLN Mach-Zehnder modulator (TFLN-MZM) with high extinction ratio (ER). The fabricated modulator has achieved the ER of 41 dB by integrating a waveguide polarizer, an intentional input-output waveguide misalignment, and a Mach-Zehnder interferometer (MZI) structure composed of 1 x 2 multimode interferometers (MMIs). The polarization extinction ratio (PER) of this integrated waveguide polarizer is 38 dB, effectively filtering out all polarizations except the transverse electric (TE) mode. The measured half-wave voltage (V pi) for the fabricated modulator with a modulation arm length of 3.3 mm is 7.9 V, corresponding to a voltage-length product of 2.6 V<middle dot>cm. The proposed modulator improves the extinction ratio without the need for additional control circuits, and thus it has wide applications in optical communication, quantum key distribution, lidar, fiber-optic distributed acoustic sensing (DAS), etc. (c) 2025 Optica Publishing Group under the terms of the Optica Open Access Publishing Agreement

TI Quantum Mechanics MP2 and CASSCF Study of Coordinate Quasi-Double Bonds
   in Cobalt(II) Complexes as Single Molecule Magnets
SO NANOMATERIALS
AB Co(II) complexes have shown promising applications as single-molecule magnets (SMMs) in quantum computing and structural biology. Deciphering the Co(II) complexes may facilitate the development of SMM materials. Structural optimizations and calculations of chemical and magnetic properties were performed for Co(II) complexes with a tripodal tetradentate phenolate-amine ligand using MP2/aug-cc-pvdz, MP2/Def2svp, and CASSCF/Def2svp methods. The Second Order Perturbation Theory Analysis of Fock Matrix in NBO Basis unravels that Co(II) ions form unusual coordinate quasi-double bonds with ligand oxygen donor atoms, and the bond strengths range from 142.01 kcal/mol to 167.36 kcal/mol but lack further spectrometric evidence. The average 151.70 kcal/mol of the Co(II-O coordinates quasi-double bonds are formed mainly by two lone pairs of electrons from the ligand phenolate donor oxygen atoms. Dispersion forces contribute 24%, 28%, 27%, and 31% to the Co(II)-ligand interaction. Theoretical results of ZFS D, transversal ZFS E, and g-factor agree well with the experimental values. Magnetic susceptibility parameters calculated based on 5 doublet roots account for 85% of results computed 40 doublet roots are specified. These insights may aid in the rational design of SMM materials and Co(II) porphyrin fullerene conjugate for CO2 electroreduction with superior magnetic properties.

TI Density matrix emulation of quantum recurrent neural networks for
   multivariate time series prediction
SO MACHINE LEARNING-SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB Quantum recurrent neural networks (QRNNs) are robust candidates for modelling and predicting future values in multivariate time series. However, the effective implementation of some QRNN models is limited by the need for mid-circuit measurements. Those increase the requirements for quantum hardware, which in the current noisy intermediate-scale quantum era does not allow reliable computations. Emulation arises as the main near-term alternative to explore the potential of QRNNs, but existing quantum emulators are not dedicated to circuits with multiple intermediate measurements. In this context, we design a specific emulation method that relies on density matrix formalism. Using a compact tensor notation, we provide the mathematical formulation of the operator-sum representation involved. This allows us to show how the present and past information from a time series is transmitted through the circuit, and how to reduce the computational cost in every time step of the emulated network. In addition, we derive the analytical gradient and the Hessian of the network outputs with respect to its trainable parameters, which are needed when the outputs have stochastic noise due to hardware errors and a finite number of circuit shots (sampling). We finally test the presented methods using a hardware-efficient ansatz and four diverse datasets that include univariate and multivariate time series, with and without sampling noise. In addition, we compare the model with other existing quantum and classical approaches. Our results show how QRNNs can be trained with numerical and analytical gradients to make accurate predictions of future values by capturing non-trivial patterns of input series with different complexities.

AB Breast cancer is one of the most aggressive types of cancer, and its early diagnosis is crucial for reducing mortality rates and ensuring timely treatment. Computer-aided diagnosis systems provide automated mammography image processing, interpretation, and grading. However, since the currently existing methods suffer from such issues as overfitting, lack of adaptability, and dependence on massive annotated datasets, the present work introduces a hybrid approach to enhance breast cancer classification accuracy. The proposed Q-BGWO-SQSVM approach utilizes an improved quantum-inspired binary Grey Wolf Optimizer and combines it with SqueezeNet and Support Vector Machines to exhibit sophisticated performance. SqueezeNet's fire modules and complex bypass mechanisms extract distinct features from mammography images. Then, these features are optimized by the Q-BGWO for determining the best SVM parameters. Since the current CAD system is more reliable, accurate, and sensitive, its application is advantageous for healthcare. The proposed Q-BGWO-SQSVM was evaluated using diverse databases: MIAS, INbreast, DDSM, and CBIS-DDSM, analyzing its performance regarding accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, precision, F1 score, and MCC. Notably, on the CBIS-DDSM dataset, the Q-BGWO-SQSVM achieved remarkable results at 99% accuracy, 98% sensitivity, and 100% specificity in 15-fold cross-validation. Finally, it can be observed that the performance of the designed Q-BGWO-SQSVM model is excellent, and its potential realization in other datasets and imaging conditions is promising. The novel Q-BGWO-SQSVM model outperforms the state-of-the-art classification methods and offers accurate and reliable early breast cancer detection, which is essential for further healthcare development.

TI Lattice Boltzmann simulations for soft flowing matter
SO PHYSICS REPORTS-REVIEW SECTION OF PHYSICS LETTERS
AB Over the last decade, the Lattice Boltzmann method has found major scope for the simulation of a large spectrum of problems in soft matter, from multiphase and multicomponent microfluidic flows, to foams, emulsions, colloidal flows, to name but a few. Crucial to many such applications is the role of supramolecular interactions which occur whenever mesoscale structures, such as bubbles or droplets, come in close contact, say of the order of tens of nanometers. Regardless of their specific physicochemical origin, such near-contact interactions are vital to preserve the coherence of the mesoscale structures against coalescence phenomena promoted by capillarity and surface tension, hence the need of including them in Lattice Boltzmann schemes. Strictly speaking, this entails a complex multiscale problem, covering about six spatial decades, from centimeters down to tens of nanometers, and almost twice as many in time. Such a multiscale problem can hardly be taken by a single computational method, hence the need for coarse-grained models for the near-contact interactions. In this review, we shall discuss such coarse-grained models and illustrate their application to a variety of soft flowing matter problems, such as soft flowing crystals, strongly confined dense emulsions, flowing hierarchical emulsions, soft granular flows, as well as the transmigration of active droplets across constrictions. Finally, we conclude with a few considerations on future developments in the direction of quantum-nanofluidics, machine learning, and quantum computing for soft flows applications.

TI Ab-Initio calculations on physical properties of Dirac semimetal AMgBi
   (A=K, Rb, Cs)
SO JOURNAL OF SOLID STATE CHEMISTRY
AB This study presents a comprehensive first-principles investigation of the structural, mechanical, vibrational, thermodynamic and electronic properties of AMgBi (A = K, Rb, Cs) compounds using Density Functional Theory. Also, the effect of substituting alkali atoms on the physical properties has been discussed. The tetragonal PbClFtype structure has been confirmed by the analysis and the results revealed good agreement between calculated and experimental lattice parameters for KMgBi. The mechanical properties have been investigated for the first time for RbMgBi and CsMgBi. The mechanical stability of the materials in the ground state has been confirmed through the use of obtained elastic constants. Furthermore, derived parameters from elastic constants such as bulk modulus, shear modulus, and Poisson's ratio indicated that the materials are brittle and exhibited anisotropic mechanical behavior due to their layered structure. This study conducts a detailed analysis of phonon modes, explores their connections to thermal and elastic properties, visualizes the movements of phonon modes at the gamma point, determines Born effective charges, and discusses LO/TO splitting, which is for the first time for RbMgBi and CsMgBi. Phonon dispersion calculations confirmed the dynamical stability of the compounds and revealed the presence of phonon band gaps, supporting their quasi-two-dimensional nature. Investigation of thermodynamic properties using the quasi-harmonic approximation has shown the temperature dependence of internal energy, Helmholtz free energy, specific heat, and entropy for the first time for all compounds. The materials exhibited relatively low thermal conductivity, following the order KMgBi > RbMgBi > CsMgBi. The calculated Gr & uuml;neisen parameter values were found to be 1.42, 1.44, and 1.53 for KMgBi, RbMgBi, and CsMgBi, respectively, suggesting relatively weak anharmonicity within the materials.

TI ZrNb(CO) RF Superconducting Thin Film with High Critical Temperature in
   the Theoretical Limit
SO ADVANCED ELECTRONIC MATERIALS
AB Superconducting radio-frequency (SRF) resonators are critical components for particle accelerator applications, such as free-electron lasers, and for emerging technologies in quantum computing. Developing advanced materials and their deposition processes to produce RF superconductors that yield n & omega; surface resistances is a key metric for the wider adoption of SRF technology. Here, ZrNb(CO) RF superconducting films with high critical temperatures (T-c) achieved for the first time under ambient pressure are reported. The attainment of a T-c near the theoretical limit for this material without applied pressure is promising for its use in practical applications. A range of T-c, likely arising from Zr doping variation, may allow a tunable superconducting coherence length that lowers the sensitivity to material defects when an ultra-low surface resistance is required. The ZrNb(CO) films are synthesized using a low-temperature (100 - 200 & DEG;C) electrochemical recipe combined with thermal annealing. The phase transformation as a function of annealing temperature and time is optimized by the evaporated Zr-Nb diffusion couples. Through phase control, one avoids hexagonal Zr phases that are equilibrium-stable but degrade T-c. X-ray and electron diffraction combined with photoelectron spectroscopy reveal a system containing cubic & beta;-ZrNb mixed with rocksalt NbC and low-dielectric-loss ZrO2. Proof-of-concept RF performance of ZrNb(CO) on an SRF sample test system is demonstrated. BCS resistance trends lower than reference Nb, while quench fields occur at approximately 35 mT. The results demonstrate the potential of ZrNb(CO) thin films for particle accelerators and other SRF applications.

TI Quantum Chaotic Butterfly Optimization Algorithm With Ranking Strategy
   for Constrained Optimization Problems
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB Nature-inspired metaheuristic optimization algorithms, e.g., the butterfly optimization algorithm (BOA), have become increasingly popular. The BOA, which adapts the food foraging and social behaviors of butterflies, involves randomly defined, algorithmic-dependent parameters that affect the exploration and exploitation strategies, which negatively influences the overall performance of the algorithm. To address this issue and improve performance, this paper proposes a modified BOA, i.e., the quantum chaos BOA (QCBOA), that relies on chaos theory and quantum computing techniques. Chaos mapping of unpredictable and divergent behavior helps tune critical parameters, and the quantum wave concept helps the representative butterflies in the algorithm explore the search space more effectively. The proposed QCBOA also implements a ranking strategy to maintain balance between the exploration and exploitation phases, which is lacking in conventional BOAs. To evaluate reliability and efficiency, the proposed QCBOA is tested against a well-utilized set of 20 benchmark functions and travelling salesman problem which belongs to the class of combinatorial optimization problems. Besides, the proposed method is also adopted to photovoltaic system parameter extraction to demonstrate its application to real-word problems. An extensive comparative study was also conducted to compare the performance of QCBOA with that of the conventional BOAs, fine-tuned particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm, differential evolution (DE), and genetic algorithm (GA). The results demonstrate that, chaos functions with the quantum wave concept yield better performance for most tested cases and comparative results in the rest of the cases. The speed of convergence also increased compared to the conventional BOAs. The proposed QCBOA is expected to provide better results in other real-word optimization problems and benchmark functions.

TI Enhancing Security and Authenticity in Immersive Environments
SO INFORMATION
AB Immersive environments have brought a great transformation in human-computer interaction by enabling realistic and interactive experiences within simulated or augmented spaces. In these immersive environments, virtual assets such as custom avatars, digital artwork, and virtual real estate play an important role, often holding a substantial value in both virtual and real worlds. However, this value also makes them attractive to fraudulent activities. As a result, ensuring the authenticity and integrity of virtual assets is of concern. This study proposes a cryptographic solution that leverages digital signatures and hash algorithms to secure virtual assets in immersive environments. The system employs RSA-2048 for signing and SHA-256 hashing for binding the digital signature to the asset's data to prevent tampering and forgery. Our experimental evaluation demonstrates that the signing process operates with remarkable efficiency; over ten trials, the signing time averaged 17.3 ms, with a narrow range of 16-19 ms and a standard deviation of 1.1 ms. Verification times were near-instantaneous (0-1 ms), ensuring real-time responsiveness. Moreover, the signing process incurred a minimal memory footprint of approximately 4 KB, highlighting the system's suitability for resource-constrained VR applications. Simulations of tampering and forgery attacks further validated the system's capability to detect unauthorized modifications, with a 100% detection rate observed across multiple trials. While the system currently employs RSA, which may be vulnerable to quantum computing in the future, its modular design ensures crypto-agility, allowing for the integration of quantum-resistant algorithms as needed. This work not only addresses immediate security challenges in immersive environments but also lays the groundwork for broader applications, including regulatory compliance for financial virtual assets.

TI An Algorithm for Reversible Logic Circuit Synthesis Based on Tensor
   Decomposition
SO ACM TRANSACTIONS ON QUANTUM COMPUTING
AB An algorithm for reversible logic synthesis is proposed. The task is, for a given n-bit substitution map, to find a sequence of reversible logic gates that implements the map. The gate library adopted in this work consists of multiple-controlled Toffoli gates with m control bits, where m is an element of {0,& mldr;,n-1} . Controlled gates with large m(> 2) are then further decomposed into smaller gates ( m <= 2 ). A primary goal in designing the algorithm is to reduce the number of Toffoli gates, which is known to be universal. The main idea is to view an n-bit substitution map as a rank-2n tensor and to transform it such that the resulting map can be written as a tensor product of a rank-(2n-2) tensor and the 2x 2 identity matrix. It can then be seen that the transformed map acts nontrivially on n-1 bits only, meaning that the map to be synthesized becomes (n-1)-bit substitution. This size reduction process is iteratively applied until it reaches a tensor product of only 2x 2 matrices. The time complexity of the algorithm is exponential in n, as most previously known heuristic algorithms for reversible logic synthesis are, but it terminates within reasonable time for not too large n, which may find practical uses. As stated earlier, our primary target is to reduce the number of Toffoli gates in the output circuit. Benchmark results show that the algorithm works well for hard benchmark functions, but it does not seem advantageous when the function is structured. As an application, the algorithm is applied to find reversible circuits for cryptographic substitution boxes, which are often required in quantum cryptanalysis.

TI Wiener-Hopf factorization approach to a bulk-boundary correspondence and
   stability conditions for topological zero-energy modes
SO ANNALS OF PHYSICS
AB Both the physics and applications of fermionic symmetry-protected topological phases rely heavily on a principle known as bulk-boundary correspondence, which predicts the emergence of protected boundary-localized energy excitations (boundary states) if the bulk is topologically non-trivial. Current theoretical approaches formulate a bulk-boundary correspondence as an equality between a bulk and a boundary topological invariant, where the latter is a property of boundary states. However, such an equality does not offer insight into the stability or the sensitivity of the boundary states to external perturbations. To solve this problem, we adopt a technique known as the Wiener-Hopf factorization of matrix functions. Using this technique, we first provide an elementary proof of the equality of the bulk and the boundary invariants for one-dimensional systems with arbitrary boundary conditions in all Altland- Zirnbauer symmetry classes. This equality also applies to quasi-one-dimensional systems (e.g., junctions) formed by bulks belonging to the same symmetry class. We then show that only topologically non-trivial Hamiltonians can host stable zero-energy edge modes, where stability refers to continuous deformation of zero-energy excitations with external perturbations that preserve the symmetries of the class. By leveraging the Wiener-Hopf factorization, we establish bounds on the sensitivity of such stable zero-energy modes to external perturbations. Our results show that the Wiener-Hopf factorization is a natural tool to investigate bulk-boundary correspondence in quasi-one-dimensional fermionic symmetry-protected topological phases. Our results on the stability and sensitivity of zero-energy modes are especially valuable for applications, including Majorana-based topological quantum computing.

TI Designing Next-Generation Molecular Logic Circuits: Photonic
   Concatenation in Upconverting Nanocrystals
SO ADVANCED OPTICAL MATERIALS
AB Computers and computing systems are getting an increasingly essential role in society, as revealed by the current emergence of Artificial Intelligence. The further increase in computer systems and digitalization of society will certainly demand innovative computing systems with higher processing speeds at low energetic and capital costs. Remarkable developments in the last five years have been reported for quantum computing; nevertheless, photonic and molecular computing has also been evolving with the potential of reaching the maximum possible miniaturization by using molecules as building blocks for basilar logic systems. One of the main challenges for molecular logic is the logical connection between molecular elements, called concatenation. Until now, concatenation of molecular logic gates has been exclusively reported using chemical species, with obvious practical limitations. In this work, the first photonic concatenation of a NAND with an AND molecular logic gate is presented. The logic system is implemented on nanoplatforms of Yb3+/Er3+ core@shell Sr2YF7 nanocrystals that are used to define combinatory logic gates and temperature-reconfigurable logic systems. The results show that upconverting nanocrystals are promising platforms for the development of solid-state molecular logic devices. These devices can reproduce the logical operations that are currently implemented in electronic devices.

TI D2DSec: An efficient quantum-safe authentication scheme for secure in
   coverage Device-to-Device communication in 5G networks
SO JOURNAL OF INFORMATION SECURITY AND APPLICATIONS
AB Device-to-Device (D2D) communication in a 5G network offers direct interaction between devices in close vicinity, bypassing the need for 5G network infrastructure for user data transmission. This approach enhances network performance by reducing traffic on the 5G core network, extending coverage, and minimizing communication latency. D2D communication is classified into three use-case scenarios based on the network's coverage: In-coverage, Relay coverage, and Out-of-coverage. In the In-coverage scenario, both communicating devices operate in the network's coverage area. As D2D communication gains increasing attention, the need for a secure authentication and key agreement scheme becomes paramount. While public key infrastructure (PKI) solutions, such as RSA and ECC, are widely used, they are vulnerable to quantum attacks, particularly Shor's algorithm. To address this challenge, we propose a lightweight authentication and key agreement scheme. The significance of the proposal is that it enhances resistance to quantum attacks by leveraging symmetric key techniques and the SHA3-512 hash function, offering robustness against Grover's algorithm and avoiding vulnerabilities associated with Shor's algorithm. This ensures a higher level of security in anticipation of emerging quantum threats, given the rapid advancements in quantum computing. Validation through BAN logic and AVISPA confirms the scheme's resilience against various threats, while performance analysis highlights its efficiency with minimal computation and communication overhead. The computation overhead of the devices is measured at 931.04 ms for the Arduino Uno Rev 3, 37.14 ms for the ESP8266, and 2.96 ms for the Raspberry Pi 4, while the communication overhead is measured to be 7920 bits.

TI Past, present, and future of hybrid plasmonic waveguides for photonics
   integrated circuits
SO NANOTECHNOLOGY AND PRECISION ENGINEERING
AB This article addresses the past, present, and future status of hybrid plasmonic waveguides (HPWs). It presents a comprehensive review of HPW-based photonic integrated circuits (PICs), covering both passive and active devices, as well as potential application of on-chip HPW-based devices. HPW-based integrated circuits (HPWICs) are compatible with complementary metal oxide semiconductor technology, and their matched refractive indices enables the adaptation of existing fabrication processes for silicon-on-insulator designs. HPWs combine plasmonic and photonic waveguide components to provide strong confinement with longer propagation length L-p of HP modes with nominal losses. These HPWs are able to make a trade-off between low loss and longer L-p, which is not possible with independent plasmonic and photonic waveguide components owing to their inability to simultaneously achieve low propagation loss with rapid and effective all-optical functionality. With HPWs, it is possible to overcome challenges such as high Ohmic losses and enhance the functional performance of PICs through the use of multiple discrete components. HPWs have been employed not only to guide transverse magnetic modes but also for optical beam manipulation, wireless optical communication, filtering, computation, sensing of bending, optical signal emission, and splitting. They also have the potential to play a pivotal role in optical communication systems for quantum computing and within data centers. At present, HPW-based PICs are poised to transform wireless chip-to-chip communication, a number of areas of biomedical science, machine learning, and artificial intelligence, as well as enabling the creation of densely integrated circuits and highly compact photonic devices.

TI The versatility of the Cholesky decomposition in electronic structure
   theory
SO WILEY INTERDISCIPLINARY REVIEWS-COMPUTATIONAL MOLECULAR SCIENCE
AB The resolution-of-the-identity (RI) or density fitting (DF) approximation for the electron repulsion integrals (ERIs) has become a standard component of accelerated and reduced-scaling implementations of first-principles Gaussian-type orbital electronic-structure methods. The Cholesky decomposition (CD) of the ERIs has also become increasingly deployed across quantum chemistry packages in the last decade, even though its early applications were mostly limited to high-accuracy methods such as coupled-cluster theory and multiconfigurational approaches. Starting with a summary of the basic theory underpinning both the CD and RI/DF approximations, thus underlining the extremely close relation of the CD and RI/DF techniques, we provide a brief and largely chronological review of the evolution of the CD approach from its birth in 1977 to its current state. In addition to being a purely numerical procedure for handling ERIs, thus providing robust and computationally efficient approximations to the exact ERIs that have been found increasingly useful on modern computer platforms, CD also offers highly accurate approaches for generating auxiliary basis sets for the RI/DF approximation on the fly due to the deep mathematical connection between the two approaches. In this review, we aim to provide a concise reference of the main techniques employed in various CD approaches in electronic structure theory, to exemplify the connection between the CD and RI/DF approaches, and to clarify the state of the art to guide new implementations of CD approaches across electronic structure programs.

TI Ab initio calculations of structural, electronic, optical, and magnetic
   properties of delafossite SMoO2 (S?=?Na, K, Rb, Cs) for
   spintronics
SO APPLIED PHYSICS A-MATERIALS SCIENCE & PROCESSING
AB Half metallic ferromagnetic (HMF) are key materials for quantum computing information storage devices and green energy. So, the structural, electronic, optical, and magnetic properties of SMoO2 (S = Na, K, Rb, Cs) are studied by quantum simulations based on density functional theory (DFT) within WIEN2K code. The Perdew - Burke - Ernzerhof (PBE + GGA) was used for the exchange correlation potential to study the said compounds. The volume optimization properties indicated that these compounds have minimum ground state energy in monoclinic crystal structure with space group 12 C2/m. Moreover, electronic band gap properties and density of states (DOS) graphs depicted the metallic nature for spin up a channel and semiconductor nature for spin down channel. This confirms the half-metallic ferromagnetism (HMF), and Heisenberg's classical model confirms the 100% spin polarization. Various frequency dependent optical parameters explain the optical properties. The double exchange process, crystal field energy ?E-cry, direct ?(x)(d), and indirect exchange energies ?(x)(pd), is demonstrated by the quantum ferromagnetic behavior. The negative value of ?(x)(pd) and magnetic exchange constants confirm the ferromagnetism due to the quantum exchange mechanism of electrons. In addition to the above, it has been noted from the density of states that Mo d-states are responsible for the response of half metallic nature of these compounds. The magnetic parameter values of SMoO2 (S = Na, K, Rb, and Cs) show higher magnetic moment and major contribution coming from the Mo atom. Hence the studied results show that these compounds are valuable materials for spintronic applications.

TI Quantum Processing in Fusion of SAR and Optical Images for Deep
   Learning: A Data-Centric Approach
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB Deep learning techniques are very prominent in processing remotely sensed synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images for real-time, high-impact applications, such as image classification, object detection, and semantic segmentation. The accuracy of deep learning models, such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs), depends on the quality of the input data. Compared to the model-centric approach, where the model parameters are optimized during training, the data-centric approach can enhance the performance accuracy as data quality is improved before training the models. Improving the data quality of SAR images is challenging as SAR image properties are different from optical images. Image fusion techniques proved to enhance the quality of SAR images when combined with optical images. Many fusion techniques exist for combining SAR and optical images in the classical domain. This paper proposes a novel approach to using quantum computing for the image fusion of SAR and optical images. Eight different quantum techniques are used to process and fuse the images. We designed and created a dataset for land-use classification by collecting data using the Google Earth Engine. The quality metric measurements show that the quality of SAR images has improved by using the proposed quantum processing techniques. In addition, performance evaluation of the deep learning CNNs on the dataset was carried out for all quantum processing techniques. Our approach improved the classification accuracy from 82.64%, with only SAR images for training, to 95.36% using the proposed image fusion techniques.

TI A continuous-wave photon-pair source operating in L-band through
   spontaneous four-wave mixing in birefringent ZBLAN fiber
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB A continuous-wave (CW) photon-pair source operating in the L-band was successfully realized based on spontaneous four-wave mixing (SFWM) by using short length of a birefringent ZBLAN fiber. A type-III phase-matched SFWM process was utilized by pumping a birefringent ZBLAN fiber with pump photons polarized along the slow axis, where signal and idler photons were generated with polarizations aligned to the vertical axis of the birefringent ZBLAN fiber. The phase-matching curve was calculated, and the joint spectral intensity was analyzed under 1310 nm pumping conditions. Then, we experimentally generated signal and idler photons with center wavelengths of 1117 and 1578 nm using a 1310 nm CW laser as a pump light source and measured their quantum optical properties. The maximum coincidence-to-accidental ratio was calculated to be 22, resulting in a photon-pair brightness of 3.16 x 104 pairs/s/nm/mW. The results show the feasibility of using ZBLAN fibers in quantum optics as an efficient platform for generating a quantum light source.

TI Quantum-Inspired Secure Wireless Communication Protocol Under Spatial
   and Local Gaussian Noise Assumptions
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB Inspired by quantum key distribution, we consider wireless communication between Alice and Bob when the noise generated in the intermediate space between Alice and Bob is controlled by Eve. Our model divides the channel noise into two parts, the noise generated during the transmission and the noise generated in the detector. Eve is allowed to control the former, but is not allowed to do the latter. While the latter is assumed to be a Gaussian random variable, the former is not assumed to be a Gaussian random variable. In this situation, using backward reconciliation and random sampling, we propose a protocol to generate secure keys between Alice and Bob under the assumption that Eve's detector has a Gaussian noise and Eve is not so close to Alice's transmitting device. In our protocol, the security criteria are quantitatively guaranteed even with finite block-length code based on the evaluation of error of the estimation of the channel.

TI Shaping entangled photons through emulated turbulent atmosphere
SO OSA CONTINUUM
AB Scattering by atmospheric turbulence is one of the main challenges in creating long free-space optical links, and specifically links of entangled photons. Classical compensation methods are hard to apply to entangled photons, due to inherently low signal to noise ratios and the fragility of entanglement. We have recently shown that we can use a bright laser beam that pumps spontaneous parametric down conversion to control the spatial correlations between entangled photons for compensating their scattering. In this work, we apply the pump-shaping technique to compensate for the scrambling of correlations between entangled photons that scatter by emulated atmospheric turbulence. We use a spatial light modulator and Kolmogorov's turbulence model to emulate atmospheric turbulence in the lab, and enhance the entangled photons' signal by a factor of fifteen using pump optimization. We show this for both a static and dynamic emulated atmosphere, and also demonstrate the compensation of the scattering of a higher-order mode. Our results can open the door towards realizing free-space quantum links with entangled photons, used in applications such as quantum key distribution.

TI High-quality Si/SiGe heterojunctions on transferred SiGe nanomembranes
SO ACTA PHYSICA SINICA
AB Strained silicon technology employing strain-relaxed SiGe virtual substrates has become pivotal factor in advancing group IV semiconductor electronics, photonic devices, silicon-based quantum computing architectures, and neuromorphic devices. Although existing approaches using Si/SiGe superlattice buffers and compositionally graded SiGe layers can produce high-quality SiGe virtual substrates, defects including threading dislocations and crosshatch patterns still limit further performance enhancement. This study demonstrates a method of fabricating fully elastically relaxed SiGe nanomembranes that effectively suppresses the formation of both threading dislocations and crosshatch patterns. The fabrication process comprises three key steps: 1) epitaxially growing Si/SiGe/Si heterostructures on silicon-on-insulator substrates via molecular beam epitaxy (MBE), 2) fabricating periodic pore arrays by using photolithography and reactive ion etching, and 3) selectively wet etching and subsequently transferring nanomembranes to Si(001) substrates. Subsequently, a Si/SiGe heterostructure is grown on the SiGe nanomembranes via MBE. The full elastic relaxation state of the SiGe nanomembranes and the fully strained state of the Si quantum well in the epitaxial Si/SiGe heterostructures are verified using Raman spectroscopy. Surface root-mean-square roughness value is 0.323 nm for the SiGe nanomembrane transferred to the silicon substrate and 0.118 nm for the epitaxial Si/SiGe heterostructure, which are demonstrated through atomic force microscopy measurements. Through electron channel contrast imaging, it is demonstrated that the Si/SiGe heterostructures grown on SiGe nanomembranes have uniform surface contrast and no detectable threading dislocations. Comparatively, the silicon substrate region exhibits high-density threading dislocations accompanied by stacking faults. Cross-sectional transmission electron microscope analysis shows atomically sharp and defect-free interfaces. This research lays a critical foundation for developing high-mobility two-dimensional electron gas systems and high-performance quantum bits.

TI A Robust Heuristics for the Online Job Shop Scheduling Problem
SO ALGORITHMS
AB The job shop scheduling problem (JSSP) is a popular NP-hard problem in combinatorial optimization, due to its theoretical appeal and its importance in applications. In practical applications, the online version is much closer to the needs of smart manufacturing in Industry 4.0 and 5.0. Here, the online version of the job shop scheduling problem is solved by a heuristics that governs local queues at the machines. This enables a distributed implementation, i.e., a digital twin can be maintained by local processors which can result in high speed real time operation. The heuristics at the level of probabilistic rules for running the local queues is experimentally shown to provide the solutions of quality that is within acceptable approximation ratios to the best known solutions obtained by the best online algorithms. The probabilistic rule defines a model which is not unlike the spin glass models that are closely related to quantum computing. Major advances of the approach are the inherent parallelism and its robustness, promising natural and likely successful application to other variations of JSSP. Experimental results show that the heuristics, although designed for solving the online version, can provide near-optimal and often even optimal solutions for many benchmark instances of the offline version of JSSP. It is also demonstrated that the best solutions of the new heuristics clearly improve over the results obtained by heuristics based on standard dispatching rules. Of course, there is a trade-off between better computational time and the quality of the results in terms of makespan criteria.

TI Privacy-Preserving Hybrid Federated Learning Framework for Mental
   Healthcare Applications: Clustered and Quantum Approaches
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB Privacy-preserving approaches are essential in health- care applications where sensitive data is involved. Federated learning (FL) has emerged as a widely adopted approach for collaboratively training decentralized models without sharing individual health records. However, ensuring privacy in health- care data, both during training and when clients exchange their models with a central server, remains a challenge. Bias, fairness, clients heterogeneity, and constrained computation are also challenging factors. To address this challenge, in this paper, a communication-efficient and privacy-preserving hybrid Federated learning (HFL) framework is specifically designed for mental healthcare applications. Two HFL approaches, namely Clustered Federated Learning (CFL) and Quantum Federated Learning (QFL), have been proposed. CFL focuses on leveraging the learning behaviour of clients and Conversely, QFL introduces a new phase to FL by incorporating a variational quantum classifier (VQC) for classification tasks. Angle encoding is used for a quantum state preparation to enhance data encoding and learning the quantum model. Experiments were conducted on independent and identically distributed (iid) and non-independent and identically distributed (non-iid) data to evaluate the performance of the proposed methods with state-of-the-art results available in the literature. The results demonstrate exceptional performance in the case of QFL, achieving an accuracy of 84.00%. CFL also exhibits promising results with an accuracy of 78.396%. Additionally, QFL achieves 18.75% better recall and CFL has 6.24% better precision than traditional FL. Nevertheless, it's crucial to remember that every model has advantages and disadvantages of its own.

AB This paper analyzes the identified key elements that are needed by the Industrial sector to ensure the seamless transition of enterprises from the "4.0 paradigm" - based on digitalization and technologies, to the "5.0 paradigm" - focused on resilience, "green" mindset and human-centric approach. The basis of this analysis is a research survey conducted within a century-old European technology company, focused on automotive products, with over 20 locations spread on more than 10 countries and on 4 continents. The goal of this paper is to identify both the needs of the Industrial sector concerning the "5.0 Transition" and the focus points for the CoDEMO 5.0 project, concerning what the Industry players expect from this Consortium. Moreover, this paper aims to define a process in which these two elements combine harmoniously so that a continuous positive feedback loop is established and, if implemented on a wider scale, could establish a new way of working among the EU Industrial actors, thanks to the collaborative network that shall be established. Concerning this study, such a collaborative network is composed of a "triple-helix" formed by the Customer (OEM manufacturer), the Supplier (automotive company), and the Academic Partner. Such partnership will enable the OEM to come out with new, and groundbreaking products that stand out from their competitors, thanks to the supplier that is creating these products which in turn, can develop them thanks to the academic partner that prepares highly skilled professionals for the current and future emerging technologies from Industrial sector like Artificial Intelligence, machine learning, blockchain, quantum computing, IIoTs, etc.

TI pH-Switching of the luminescent, redox, and magnetic properties in a
   spin crossover cobalt(II) molecular nanomagnet
SO CHEMICAL SCIENCE
AB The ability of mononuclear first-row transition metal complexes as dynamic molecular systems to perform selective functions under the control of an external stimulus that appropriately tunes their properties may greatly impact several domains of molecular nanoscience and nanotechnology. This study focuses on two mononuclear octahedral cobalt( II) complexes of formula {[Co-II(HL)(2)][Co-II(HL) L]}(ClO4)(3)$9H(2)O (1) and [(CoL2)-L-II]$5H(2)O (2) [ HL = 4'-(4-carboxyphenyl)-2,2':6',2''-terpyridine], isolated as a mixed protonated/hemiprotonated cationic salt or a deprotonated neutral species. This pair of pH isomers constitutes a remarkable example of a dynamic molecular system exhibiting reversible changes in luminescence, redox, and magnetic (spin crossover and spin dynamics) properties as a result of ligand deprotonation, either in solution or solid state. In this last case, the thermal-assisted spin transition coexists with the field-induced magnetisation blockage of "faster" or "slower" relaxing low-spin Co-II ions in 1 or 2, respectively. In addition, pH- reversible control of the acid-base equilibrium among dicationic protonated, cationic hemiprotonated, and neutral deprotonated forms in solution enhances luminescence in the UV region. Besides, the reversibility of the one- electron oxidation of the paramagnetic low-spin CoII into the diamagnetic low-spin Co-III ion is partially lost and completely restored by pH decreasing and increasing. The fine- tuning of the optical, redox, and magnetic properties in this novel class of pH-responsive, spin crossover molecular nanomagnets offers fascinating possibilities for advanced multifunctional and multiresponsive magnetic devices for molecular spintronics and quantum computing such as pHeffect spin quantum transformers.

TI Internal dynamics in condensed matter, as studied by spin relaxation:
   some examples from 75 years
SO EUROPEAN PHYSICAL JOURNAL H
AB The present year 2021 celebrates the 75th anniversary of the nuclear magnetic resonance method (NMR), which has had an immense importance for several branches of physics, chemistry and biology. The splitting of resonances and the shifts in their positions are seemingly inexhaustible sources of information for organic chemistry and biology. It was first introduced for the study of nuclear spins and their associated magnetic properties and when it was observed that resonance lines were broadened by the action of fluctuating local magnetic fields it was first seen as a limitation for the exact determination of nuclear properties. However, it was soon realized that the broadening contained important information on the dynamics of atoms, molecules or cooperative spin systems surrounding the nuclei and spin perturbations became a well-developed tool for investigation of internal dynamics in liquids and solids, over time-ranges from seconds down to femtoseconds. The present article is an attempt to review this latter line of development and to pick out a series of examples of internal dynamics in different physical systems published over the past 75 years. Examples include motions of particles in solids, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), critical phenomena around phase transitions, functioning of biomolecules and recent applications to spintronics and quantum computing. Other spin-based spectroscopies followed in the tracks of NMR with use of electron spins (in electron spin resonance ESR also called electron paramagnetic resonance EPR, and ferromagnetic resonance, FMR), excited nuclear states (by observation of perturbations in angular correlation of gamma-rays, PAC) and later also muon spins (muon spin relaxation, MuSR), from which other examples are selected.

TI Temperature-Compensated Multi-Level CMOS Modulators Operating From 10 K
   to 300 K for Cryogenic Interconnects
SO IEEE JOURNAL OF MICROWAVES
AB This work presents temperature-compensated cryogenic complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) modulators operating over a 10 K to 300 K temperature range, suitable for intra- and inter-thermal cryogenic communications. Conventional metal-based coax cables suffer from a fundamental trade-off between thermal load and frequency-dependent attenuation, where lower thermal load results in higher electromagnetic attenuation. The recent surge in cryogenic high-performance computing and quantum computing has driven the demand for scalable cryogenic interconnect solutions. New techniques in optical fibers and millimeter-wave backscatter transceivers have demonstrated the ability to transport digital data between thermally isolated temperatures without the need for coaxial cables. Our new modulator can integrate (at the package or chip level) with millimeter-wave transmitters co-located on the same thermal condition while supporting bandwidth-efficient modulations such as multi-level pulse amplitude modulations. Based on this motivation, we implemented a current-steering 2-bit modulator in a 65-nanometer (nm) bulk CMOS process. The modulator achieves a data rate of 13 gigabits per second (Gb/s) while consuming 15.4 mW under a 1.2 V supply at 10 K, resulting in an energy efficiency of 1.18 picojoules per bit (pJ/b). In addition to previously demonstrated optical fibers and millimeter-wave backscatter, we implemented a 150 GHz (GHz) transmitter utilizing the same current-steering modulator scheme in a 28-nm CMOS process. We established contactless connections between thermally isolated systems operating at 10 K and 300 K, achieving a data rate of 8 Gb/s.

TI Intrinsic Ferromagnetic Semiconductors with High Saturation
   Magnetization from Hybrid Perovskites
SO ADVANCED MATERIALS
AB Ferromagnetic semiconductors (FMS) enable simultaneous control of both charge and spin transport of charge carriers, and they have emerged as a class of highly desirable but rare materials for applications in spin field-effect transistors and quantum computing. Organic-inorganic hybrid perovskites with high compositional adjustability and structural versatility can offer unique benefits in the design of FMS but has not been fully explored. Here, a series of molecular FMSs based on the 2D organic-inorganic hybrid perovskite structure, namely (2ampy)CuCl4, (3ampy)CuCl4, and (4ampy)CuCl4, is demonstrated, which exhibits high saturation magnetization, dramatic temperature-dependent conductivity change, and tunable ferromagnetic resonance. Magnetic measurements reveal a high saturation magnetization up to 18.56 emu g-1 for (4ampy)CuCl4, which is one of the highest value among reported hybrid FMSs to date. Conductivity studies of the three FMSs demonstrate that the smaller adjacent octahedron distance in the 2D layer results in higher conductivity. Systematic ferromagnetic resonance investigation shows that the gyromagnetic ratio and Landau factor values are strongly dependent on the types of organic cations used. This work demonstrates that 2D hybrid perovskite materials can simultaneously possess both tunable long-range ferromagnetic ordering and semiconductivity, providing a straightforward strategy for designing and synthesizing high-performance intrinsic FMSs.
   A new type of ferromagnetic semiconductor is obtained by exploiting the perovskite structure. The obtained (4ampy)CuCl4 exhibits a remarkably saturated magnetization up to 18.56 emu g-1, which is one of the highest-ever-reported values for organic/inorganic hybrid intrinsic ferromagnetic semiconductors.image

TI Coherence in the Ferroelectric A3ClO (A = Li, Na) Family of
   Electrolytes
SO MATERIALS
AB Coherence is a major caveat in quantum computing. While phonons and electrons are weakly coupled in a glass, topological insulators strongly depend on the electron-phonon coupling. Knowledge of the electron-phonon interaction at conducting surfaces is relevant from a fundamental point of view as well as for various applications, such as two-dimensional and quasi-1D superconductivity in nanotechnology. Similarly, the electron-phonon interaction plays a relevant role in other transport properties e.g., thermoelectricity, low-dimensional systems as layered Bi and Sb chalcogenides, and quasi-crystalline materials. Glass-electrolyte ferroelectric energy storage cells exhibit self-charge and self-cycling related to topological superconductivity and electron-phonon coupling; phonon coherence is therefore important. By recurring to ab initio molecular dynamics, it was demonstrated the tendency of the Li3ClO, Li2.92Ba0.04ClO, Na3ClO, and Na2.92Ba0.04ClO ferroelectric-electrolytes to keep phonon oscillation coherence for a short lapse of time in ps. Double-well energy potentials were obtained while the electrolyte systems were thermostatted in a heat bath at a constant temperature. The latter occurrences indicate ferroelectric type behavior but do not justify the coherent self-oscillations observed in all types of cells containing these families of electrolytes and, therefore, an emergent type phenomenon where the full cell works as a feedback system allowing oscillations coherence must be realized. A comparison with amorphous SiO2 was performed and the specific heats for the various species were calculated.

TI Next Generation Multifunctional Nano-Science of Advanced Metal Complexes
   with Quantum Effect and Nonlinearity
SO BULLETIN OF THE CHEMICAL SOCIETY OF JAPAN
AB My research target can be described as "Next Generation Multifunctional Nano-Science of Advanced Metal Complexes with Quantum Effect and Nonlinearity". My work encompasses four important key areas: (1) inorganic-organic hybrid systems, (2) nano-size and nano-space, (3) bottom-up and self-assembly, and (4) nonlinearity and quantum effect. Among them, nonlinearity and quantum effect are the most important for nanoscience of advanced metal complexes. I have been working on these two topics (nonlinearity and quantum effect) simultaneously for more than 40 years. As for quantum effect, I have focused on Haldane gap systems, single-chain magnets (SCMs), single-molecule magnets (SMMs), Kondo resonance on SMMs, photo-switchable SMMs, metallic conducting SMMs, SMMs encapsulated into single-walled carbon nanotube (SWCNT), and metal-organic framework (MOF)-spintronics for spin qubits, for pursuing high-density memory devices and quantum computing. As for nonlinearity, I have focused on quasi-one-dimensional halogen-bridged metal complexes (MX-Chains; M = Pt, Pd, and Ni; X = Cl, Br, and I) with nonlinear excitons such as solitons and polarons, strongly electron-correlated Ni(III) complexes with gigantic third-order optical nonlinearity, and phase transitions and charge fluctuations between Pd(III) averaged states (= Mott insulator) and Pd(II)-Pd(IV) mixed-valence states (= charge density wave states), for pursuing optical communication, optical switching, and optical computing. In this review article, I will describe the above main topics (quantum effect and nonlinearity) according to my research history of more than 40 years, respectively. Finally, I will propose future perspectives for the two topics.

TI Automation of quantum dot measurement analysis via explainable machine
   learning
SO MACHINE LEARNING-SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB The rapid development of quantum dot (QD) devices for quantum computing has necessitated more efficient and automated methods for device characterization and tuning. Many of the measurements acquired during the tuning process come in the form of images that need to be properly analyzed to guide the subsequent tuning steps. By design, features present in such images capture certain behaviors or states of the measured QD devices. When considered carefully, such features can aid the control and calibration of QD devices. An important example of such images are so-called triangle plots, which visually represent current flow and reveal characteristics important for QD device calibration. While image-based classification tools, such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs), can be used to verify whether a given measurement is good and thus warrants the initiation of the next phase of tuning, they do not provide any insights into how the device should be adjusted in the case of bad images. This is because CNNs sacrifice prediction and model intelligibility for high accuracy. To ameliorate this trade-off, a recent study introduced an image vectorization approach that relies on the Gabor wavelet transform (Schug et al 2024 Proc. XAI4Sci: Explainable Machine Learning for Sciences Workshop (AAAI 2024) (Vancouver, Canada) pp 1-6). Here we propose an alternative vectorization method that involves mathematical modeling of synthetic triangles to mimic the experimental data. Using explainable boosting machines, we show that this new method offers superior explainability of model prediction without sacrificing accuracy. This work demonstrates the feasibility and advantages of applying explainable machine learning techniques to the analysis of QD measurements, paving the way for further advances in automated and transparent QD device tuning.

TI Compact and Low-Latency FPGA-Based Number Theoretic Transform
   Architecture for CRYSTALS Kyber Postquantum Cryptography Scheme
SO INFORMATION
AB In the modern era of the Internet of Things (IoT), especially with the rapid development of quantum computers, the implementation of postquantum cryptography algorithms in numerous terminals allows them to defend against potential future quantum attack threats. Lattice-based cryptography can withstand quantum computing attacks, making it a viable substitute for the currently prevalent classical public-key cryptography technique. However, the algorithm's significant time complexity places a substantial computational burden on the already resource-limited chip in the IoT terminal. In lattice-based cryptography algorithms, the polynomial multiplication on the finite field is well known as the most time-consuming process. Therefore, investigations into efficient methods for calculating polynomial multiplication are essential for adopting these quantum-resistant lattice-based algorithms on a low-profile IoT terminal. Number theoretic transform (NTT), a variant of fast Fourier transform (FFT), is a technique widely employed to accelerate polynomial multiplication on the finite field to achieve a subquadratic time complexity. This study presents an efficient FPGA-based implementation of number theoretic transform for the CRYSTAL Kyber, a lattice-based public-key cryptography algorithm. Our hybrid design, which supports both forward and inverse NTT, is able run at high frequencies up to 417 MHz on a low-profile Artix7-XC7A100T and achieve a low latency of 1.10 mu s while achieving state-of-the-art hardware efficiency, consuming only 541-LUTs, 680 FFs, and four 18 Kb BRAMs. This is made possible thanks to the newly proposed multilevel pipeline butterfly unit architecture in combination with employing an effective coefficient accessing pattern.

TI AI-Empowered Fog/Edge Resource Management for IoT Applications: A
   Comprehensive Review, Research Challenges, and Future Perspectives
SO IEEE COMMUNICATIONS SURVEYS AND TUTORIALS
AB The proliferation of ubiquitous Internet of Things (IoT) sensors and smart devices in several domains embracing healthcare, Industry 4.0, transportation and agriculture are giving rise to a prodigious amount of data requiring ever-increasing computations and services from cloud to the edge of the network. Fog/Edge computing is a promising and distributed computing paradigm that has drawn extensive attention from both industry and academia. The infrastructural efficiency of these computing paradigms necessitates adaptive resource management mechanisms for offloading decisions and efficient scheduling. Resource Management (RM) is a non-trivial issue whose complexity is the result of heterogeneous resources, incoming transactional workload, edge node discovery, and Quality of Service (QoS) parameters at the same time, which makes the efficacy of resources even more challenging. Hence, the researchers have adopted Artificial Intelligence (AI)-based techniques to resolve the above-mentioned issues. This paper offers a comprehensive review of resource management issues and challenges in Fog/Edge paradigm by categorizing them into provisioning of computing resources, task offloading, resource scheduling, service placement, and load balancing. In addition, existing AI and non-AI based state-of-the-art solutions have been discussed, along with their QoS metrics, datasets analysed, limitations and challenges. The survey provides mathematical formulation corresponding to each categorized resource management issue. Our work sheds light on promising research directions on cutting-edge technologies such as Serverless computing, 5G, Industrial IoT (IIoT), blockchain, digital twins, quantum computing, and Software-Defined Networking (SDN), which can be integrated with the existing frameworks of fog/edge-of-things paradigms to improve business intelligence and analytics amongst IoT-based applications.

TI Temperature effects in spin-dependent Hall currents in an ideal skyrmion
   gas
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
AB The quest for novel reliable and fast-performing logic and memory elements in classical and quantum computing requires discoveries of new effects in novel quantum materials. Skyrmions are such magnetic textures where electron scattering can essentially change the shape and location of the skyrmion, which can be used as a memory element being more efficient than domain walls as a memory device in classical computing. Because the skyrmion motion is sensitive even to very small currents, we study electron scattering by skyrmions in an ideal skyrmion gas in a ferromagnetic environment. In such systems, the direct and Hall currents become spin-dependent. For applications, it is important to consider a Hall effect in the whole range of temperatures under the assumption of the skyrmion existence. In this study, we find the nonmonotonic temperature dependence of the direct spin-up conductivity, i.e., the conductivity for the current directed along the applied electric field due to the electrons with the spin parallel to the ferromagnetic moment. Such a behavior contradicts the traditional understanding where the temperature only increases the value of the conductivity. The spin-down Hall conductivity is found to be even more dramatic exhibiting a conductivity sign change (i.e., a change in the current direction) with temperature for small skyrmion sizes. The found effects strongly depend on Fermi energy. The most pronounced dependencies take place if the Fermi energy is slightly below and above the bottom of the upper (spin-down) energy band of an ideal two-dimensional electron gas. In addition, we also find that the direct and Hall resistivities, rho(xx) and rho(xy), are independent of the exchange integral J for 2J > epsilon(F).

TI Revealing hidden spin polarization in centrosymmetric van der Waals
   materials on ultrafast timescales
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB One of the key challenges for spintronic and quantum technologies is to achieve active control of the spin angular momentum of electrons in nanoscale materials on ultrafast, femtosecond timescales. While conventional ferromagnetic materials and materials supporting spin texture suffer both from conceptional limitations in miniaturization and inefficiency of optical and electronic manipulation, non-magnetic centrosymmetric layered materials with hidden spin polarization may offer an alternative pathway to manipulate the spin degree of freedom by external stimuli. Here we demonstrate an approach for generating transient spin polarization on a femtosecond timescale in the otherwise spin-unpolarized band structure of the centrosymmetric 2H-stacked group VI transition metal dichalcogenide WSe2. Using ultrafast optical excitation of a fullerene layer grown on top of WSe2, we trigger an ultrafast interlayer electron transfer from the fullerene layer into the WSe2 crystal. The resulting transient charging of the C60/WSe2 interface leads to a substantial interfacial electric field that by means of spin-layer-valley locking ultimately creates ultrafast spin polarization without the need of an external magnetic field. Our findings open a novel pathway for true optical engineering of spin functionalities such as the sub-picosecond generation and manipulation of ultrafast spin currents in 2D heterostructures.
   A major challenge for spin-based information technologies is the generation of spin polarization in otherwise nonmagnetic materials. Here, Arnoldi et al. demonstrate how ultrafast laser excitations can be used to generate spin polarization in a fullerene/tungsten diselenide heterostructure.

TI Toward nonthermal control of excited quantum materials: framework and
   investigations by ultrafast electron scattering and imaging
SO COMPTES RENDUS PHYSIQUE
AB Quantum material systems upon applying ultrashort laser pulses provide a rich platform to access excited material phases and their transformations that are not entirely like their equilibrium counterparts. The addressability and potential controls of metastable or long-trapped out-of-equilibrium phases have motivated interests both for the purposes of understanding the nonequilibrium physics and advancing the quantum technologies. Thus far, the dynamical spectroscopic probes eminently focus on microscopic electronic and phonon responses. For characterizing the long-range dynamics, such as order parameter fields and fluctuation effects, the ultrafast scattering probes offer direct sensitivity. Bridging the connections between the microscopic dynamics and macroscopic responses is central toward establishing the nonequilibrium physics behind the light-induced phases. Here, we present a path toward such understanding by cross-examining the structure factors associated with different dynamical states obtained from ultrafast electron scattering, imaging, and modeling. We give the basic theoretical framework on describing the non-equilibrium scattering problems and briefly describe how such framework relates to the out-of-equilibrium phenomena. We give effective models outlining the emergences of nonthermal critical points, hidden phases, and non-equilibrium relaxational responses from vacuum-suspended rare-earth tritellurides, tantalum disulfides thin films, and vanadium dioxide nanocrystalline materials upon light excitations.

TI Multigap superconductivity at an unconventional Lifshitz transition in a
   three-dimensional Rashba heterostructure at the atomic limit
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
AB It is well known that the critical temperature of multigap superconducting three-dimensional (3D) heterostructures at atomic limit (HAL) made of a superlattice of atomic layers with an electron spectrum made of several quantum subbands can be amplified by a shape resonance driven by the contact exchange interaction between different gaps. The T-C amplification is achieved tuning the Fermi level near the singular nodal point at a Lifshitz transition for opening a neck. Recently high interest has been addressed to the breaking of inversion symmetry which leads to a linear-in-momentum spin-orbit induced spin splitting, universally referred to as Rashba spin-orbit coupling (RSOC) also in 3D layered metals. However the physics of multigap superconductivity near unconventional Lifshitz transitions in 3D HAL with RSOC, being in a non-BCS regime, is not known. The key result of this work getting the superconducting gaps by Bogoliubov theory and the 3D electron wave functions by solution of the Dirac equation is the feasibility of tuning multigap superconductivity by suitably matching the spin-orbit length with the 3D superlattice period. It is found that the presence of the RSOC amplifies both the k dependent anisotropic gap function and the critical temperature when the Fermi energy is tuned near the circular nodal line. Our results suggest a method to effectively vary the effect of RSOC on macroscopic superconductor condensates via the tuning of the superlattice modulation parameter in a way potentially relevant for spintronics functionalities in several existing experimental platforms and tunable materials needed for quantum devices for quantum computing.

TI Responsible AI in structural engineering: a framework for ethical use
SO FRONTIERS IN BUILT ENVIRONMENT
AB The integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) into structural engineering holds great promise for advancing analysis, design, and maintenance. However, it also raises critical ethical and governance challenges-including bias, lack of transparency, accountability gaps, and equity concerns-which are particularly significant in a discipline where public safety is paramount. This study addresses these issues through eight fictional but realistic case studies that illustrate plausible ethical dilemmas, such as algorithmic bias in predictive models and tensions between AI-generated recommendations and human engineering judgment. In response, the study proposes a structured framework for responsible AI implementation, organized into three key domains: (i) Technical Foundations (focusing on bias mitigation, robust validation, and explainability); (ii) Operational and Governance Considerations (emphasizing industry standards and human-in-the-loop oversight); and (iii) Professional and Societal Responsibilities (advocating for equity, accessibility, and ethical awareness among engineers). The framework offers actionable guidance for engineers, policymakers, and researchers seeking to align AI adoption with ethical principles and regulatory standards. Beyond offering practical tools, the study explores broader theoretical and institutional implications of AI, including risks associated with model drift, the need for lifecycle oversight, and the importance of cultural and geographic adaptability. It also outlines future challenges and opportunities, such as incorporating AI ethics into engineering education and considering the ethical impact of emerging technologies like quantum computing and digital twins. Rather than offering prescriptive answers, the study aims to initiate an essential dialogue on the evolving role of AI in structural engineering, equipping stakeholders to manage its benefits and risks while upholding trust, fairness, and public safety.

TI Temporally stable rotational coherent states for molecular simulations.
   II. Symmetric rotor case
SO JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL PHYSICS
AB Following our preceding work on spherical and linear rotors [C. Stopera and J. A. Morales, J. Chem. Phys. 152, 134112 (2020)], we reformulate an earlier rotational coherent state (CS) set to obtain a temporally stable (TS) CS set for symmetric rotors. Being TS, the new CSs remain within its own set during dynamics by evolving exclusively through their parameters. The TS CS set is now appropriate to reconstruct quantum rotational properties from classical-mechanics simulations of chemical reactions. Following literature precedents, we enforce temporal stability by incorporating action-angle-related phase factors into two parameters of the original CS set. Proofs and final expressions of the symmetric-rotor CS turn out more intricate than those of its spherical-rotor counterpart. We demonstrate and examine the key properties of the new CS set: continuity, resolution of unity, temporal stability, action identity, minimum uncertainty relationships, and quasi-classical behavior. Regarding the last property, we demonstrate that the body-fixed z-component of the CS angular momentum average evolves exactly as its classical counterpart, and that the x- and y-components display an astonishing analogy with their classical counterparts in terms of functional form, precession angular velocities, amplitudes, and phases. We elucidate some of these properties via computer simulations of a rotating benzene molecule represented with the CS set. We discuss the utilization of this CS set to reconstruct quantum rotational properties of symmetric-rotor molecules from classical-mechanics simulations. The new CS set is appropriate to establish quantum-classical connections for rotational properties in chemical dynamics, statistical mechanics, spectroscopy, nuclear physics, and quantum computing.

TI Leveraging computer-aided drug design for the discovery of phytohormone
   analogs: A review
SO PLANT STRESS
AB Natural phytohormones regulate plant growth, development, and stress responses, but discovering novel analogs is challenging due to complex signaling pathways, limited structural diversity, and the high cost of conventional methods. Computer-aided drug design (CADD) has emerged as a vital tool in modern phytohormone research, expediting lead compound discovery and facilitating the exploration of new phytohormone analogs. This review delves into the definition, historical evolution, key software, and representative examples of CADD applications. Notably, it provides the first comprehensive analysis of CADD's role in identifying analogs of phytohormone, including auxin, gibberellin (GA), cytokinin (CTK), abscisic acid (ABA), ethylene (ETH), and brassinolide (BR), as well as its broader applications in the study of stress-related plant metabolites. Key computational methodologies such as structure-activity relationship (SAR) analysis, molecular docking, and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations have become central to the rational design of new phytohormone analogs. Most studies focus on developing receptor-targeted agonists or antagonists, with some efforts given to their synthesis or metabolic pathways. Among the six primary phytohormones, ABA analogs are the most extensively studied, resulting in highly efficient and versatile compounds. In contrast, BR analogs remain underexplored, despite their significant agricultural potential. The pursuit of phytohormone analogs via CADD, however, faces significant challenges. These include the need for more accurate models and advanced algorithms to predict hormone-receptor interactions and metabolic pathways. Nevertheless, emerging technologies such as quantum computing and artificial intelligence (AI) promise to enhance the precision and efficiency of predictive modeling and simulations, paving the way for breakthroughs in phytohormone research.

TI Enhancing feature selection for multi-pose facial expression recognition
   using a hybrid of quantum inspired firefly algorithm and artificial bee
   colony algorithm
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB Facial expression recognition (FER) has advanced applications in various disciplines, including computer vision, Internet of Things, and artificial intelligence, supporting diverse domains such as medical escort services, learning analysis, fatigue detection, and human-computer interaction. The accuracy of these systems is of utmost concern and depends on effective feature selection, which directly impacts their ability to accurately detect facial expressions across various poses. This research proposes a new hybrid approach called QIFABC (Hybrid Quantum-Inspired Firefly and Artificial Bee Colony Algorithm), which combines the Quantum-Inspired Firefly Algorithm (QIFA) with the Artificial Bee Colony (ABC) method to enhance feature selection for a multi-pose facial expression recognition system. The proposed algorithm uses the attributes of both the QIFA and ABC algorithms to enhance search space exploration, thereby improving the robustness of features in FER. The firefly agents initially move toward the brightest firefly until identified, then search transition to the ABC algorithm, targeting positions with the highest nectar quality. In order to evaluate the efficacy of the proposed QIFABC algorithm, feature selection is also conducted using QIFA, FA, and ABC algorithms. The evaluated features are utilized for classifying face expressions by utilizing the deep neural network model, ResNet-50. The presented FER system has been tested using multi-pose facial expression benchmark datasets, including RaF (Radboud Faces) and KDEF (Karolinska Directed Emotional Faces). Experimental results show that the proposed QIFABC with ResNet50 method achieves an accuracy of 98.93%, 94.11%, and 91.79% for front, diagonal, and profile poses on the RaF dataset, respectively, and 98.47%, 93.88%, and 91.58% on the KDEF dataset.

TI Explainable AI-Driven Quantum Deep Neural Network for Fault Location in
   DC Microgrids
SO ENERGIES
AB Fault location in DC microgrids (DCMGs) is a critical challenge due to the system's inherent complexities and the demand for high reliability in modern power systems. This study proposes an explainable artificial intelligence (XAI)-based quantum deep neural network (QDNN) framework to address fault localization challenges in DCMGs. First, voltage signals from the DCMG are collected and analyzed using high-order synchrosqueezing transform to detect traveling waves (TWs) and extract critical fault parameters such as time of arrival, magnitude, and polarity of the first and second TWs. These features are fed into the proposed QDNN model that integrates advanced learning techniques for accurate fault localization. The cumulative distance from the fault point to the bus connecting the DCMG to the power network is considered the output vector. The model uses a combination of deep learning and quantum computing techniques to extract features and improve accuracy. To ensure transparency, an XAI technique called Shapley additive explanations (SHAP) is applied, enabling system operators to identify critical fault features. The SHAP-based explainability framework plays a critical role in translating the model's predictions into actionable insights, ensuring that the proposed solution is not only accurate but also practically implementable in real-world scenarios. The results demonstrate the QDNN framework's superior accuracy in fault localization even in noisy environments and with high-resistance faults, independent of voltage levels and DCMG configurations, making it a robust solution for modern power systems.

TI Dynamic Session Key Allocation with Time-Indexed Ascon for Low-Latency
   Cloud-Edge-End Communication
SO CMC-COMPUTERS MATERIALS & CONTINUA
AB With the rapid development of Cloud-Edge-End (CEE) computing, the demand for secure and lightweight communication protocols is increasingly critical, particularly for latency-sensitive applications such as smart manufacturing, healthcare, and real-time monitoring. While traditional cryptographic schemes offer robust protection, they often impose excessive computational and energy overhead, rendering them unsuitable for use in resource-constrained edge and end devices. To address these challenges, in this paper, we propose a novel lightweight the NIST-endorsed Ascon algorithm, the DSKA-TIA introduces a time-indexed session key generation mechanism that derives unique, ephemeral keys for each communication round. The scheme supports bidirectional key separation to isolate uplink and downlink data, thereby minimizing the risk of key reuse and compromise. Additionally, mutual authentication is integrated through nonce-based validation and one-time token exchanges, ensuring entity legitimacy and protection against impersonation and replay attacks. We validate the performance of DSKA-TIA through implementation on a resource-constrained microcontroller platform. Results show that our scheme achieves significantly lower latency and computational cost compared to baseline schemes such as AES and standard Ascon. Security analysis demonstrates high entropy in key generation, resistance to brute-force and replay attacks, and robustness against eavesdropping and key compromise. The protocol also exhibits resilience to quantum computing threats by relying on symmetric encryption principles and randomized key selection. Given its efficiency, scalability, and temporal security enhancements, DSKA-TIA is well-suited for real-time, secure communication in heterogeneous CEE environments. Future work will explore post-quantum extensions and deployment in domains such as smart agriculture and edge-based healthcare.

TI Predictions of delafossite-hosted honeycomb and kagome phases
SO PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY CHEMICAL PHYSICS
AB Delafossites, typically denoted by the formula ABO2, are a class of layered materials that exhibit a wide range of electronic and optical properties. Recently, the idea of modifying these delafossites into ordered kagome or honeycomb phases via strategic doping has emerged as a potential way to tailor these properties. In this study, we use high-throughput density functional theory calculations to explore many possible candidate kagome and honeycomb phases by considering dopants selected from the parent compounds of known ternary delafossite oxides from the inorganic crystal structure database. Our results indicate that while A-site in existing delafossites can host a limited range of elemental specifies, and display a low propensity for mixing or ordering, the oxide sub-units in the BO2 much more readily admit guest species. Our study identifies four candidate B-site kagome and fifteen candidate B-site honeycombs with a formation energy more than 50 meV f.u.-1 below other competing phases. The ability to predict and control the formation of these unique structures offers exciting opportunities in materials design, where innovative properties can be engineered through the selection of specific dopants. A number of these constitute novel correlated metals, which may be of interest for subsequent efforts in synthesis. These novel correlated metals may have significant implications for quantum computing, spintronics, and high-temperature superconductivity, thus inspiring future experimental synthesis and characterization of these proposed materials.
   Delafossites (ABO2) are a class of layered materials with triangular A and B sub-lattices. Via high-throughput ab initio calculations over a wide range of delafossites, we identify delafossites that preferentially admit guest species in honeycomb or kagome arrangements to form new ternary compounds.

TI Emergence of Moire Dirac Fermions at the Interface of Topological and 2D
   Magnetic Insulators
SO ACS NANO
AB Dirac Fermions on the surface of the topological insulator are spin-momentum locked and topologically protected, making them interesting for spintronics and quantum computing applications. When in proximity to magnetism and superconductivity, these electronic states could result in quantum anomalous Hall effect and Majorana Fermions, respectively. An even more dramatic enrichment of the topological insulators' physics is expected for moire superlattices, where, analogously to the twisted graphene layers, electronic correlations could be strongly enhanced, a task previously notoriously difficult to achieve in topological matter. Until now, the experimental confirmation of such moire properties has remained elusive. Here, we grow the two-dimensional van der Waals magnetic insulators FeX2 (where X = Cl or Br) on top of the topological insulator Bi2Se3 and establish a moire superlattice formation at the interface. By means of scanning tunneling microscopy and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy, we investigate the electronic properties of the formed moire superlattice and demonstrate its tunability via the film choice. We reveal replicated Dirac cones and focus on their intersections, which, in the case of FeBr2/Bi2Se3, occur below the Fermi level. We identify the signatures of small gaps at the intersections around the M i points that we attribute to the moire interaction. These findings point to the specific type of magnetic moire potential that breaks the time-reversal symmetry at these points but not at the Gamma point. Our observations provide an intriguing scenario of correlated topological phases induced by moire superlattice that may result in topological superconductivity, high Chern number phases, and exotic noncollinear magnetic textures.

TI DNA Sequence and Structure under the Prism of Group Theory and Algebraic
   Surfaces
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MOLECULAR SCIENCES
AB Taking a DNA sequence, a word with letters/bases A, T, G and C, as the relation between the generators of an infinite group pi, one can discriminate between two important families: (i) the cardinality structure for conjugacy classes of subgroups of pi is that of a free group on one to four bases, and the DNA word, viewed as a substitution sequence, is aperiodic; (ii) the cardinality structure for conjugacy classes of subgroups of pi is not that of a free group, the sequence is generally not aperiodic and topological properties of pi have to be determined differently. The two cases rely on DNA conformations such as A-DNA, B-DNA, Z-DNA, G-quadruplexes, etc. We found a few salient results: Z-DNA, when involved in transcription, replication and regulation in a healthy situation, implies (i). The sequence of telomeric repeats comprising three distinct bases most of the time satisfies (i). For two-base sequences in the free case (i) or non-free case (ii), the topology of pi may be found in terms of the SL(2,C) character variety of pi and the attached algebraic surfaces. The linking of two unknotted curves-the Hopf link-may occur in the topology of pi in cases of biological importance, in telomeres, G-quadruplexes, hairpins and junctions, a feature that we already found in the context of models of topological quantum computing. For three- and four-base sequences, other knotting configurations are noticed and a building block of the topology is the four-punctured sphere. Our methods have the potential to discriminate between potential diseases associated to the sequences.

TI REAL TIME ENTERPRISE AS A PLATFORM OF SUPPORT MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS
SO FOUNDATIONS OF MANAGEMENT
AB The current, fast market changes require enterprises to dynamically adapt the way they conduct their business. This poses many challenges for information technology. Market requirements for immediate response to business changes became the basis of the idea of a real-time information processing (RTE) company. RTE provides real-time information to employees and business partners. Integrated IT systems supporting management constitute a common platform - the foundation of a real-time enterprise. The aim of the article is to present the basic problems of building an IT system that is the basis of a realtime information processing (RTE) company. It is a summary of our work on this type of system. The article justifies the thesis about the need to build a system for the RTE's requirements and the conditions of its implementation. Such a system is designed to provide employees and business partners with the information they need in real time. The use of integrated systems such as ERP, CRM, SCM, and so on provides the ability to implement the main business processes of a real-time enterprise. The article presents both literature analysis and the characteristics of own work on designing IT systems for RTE. Particular attention was paid to the analysis of success factors (determinants) in system design and the use of MUST methodology (MUST is a Danish acronym for theories of and methods for design activities). The final part of the article presents a proposal for further work on IT systems for RTE in the context of existing trends such as DARQ technology (Distributed Ledger, Artificial Intelligence, Extended Reality, Quantum computing).

AB Long integer multiplication is a fundamental kernel in various scientific areas, including numerical linear algebra, cryptography, and quantum computing. Toom-Cook-k algorithms run in Theta(n(logk (2k-1))) and are often favored in practice over the Theta (n(2)) schoolbook algorithm. Faults are a major bottleneck in large-scale computing. The growing size of machines and decreasing operating voltages led to a reduction in the mean time between failures, with modern exascale systems experiencing an error per second. While standard fault-tolerant solutions, such as checkpoint-restart and replication, are straightforward to implement, they incur significant overhead and limit overall system utilization. Algorithm-based fault-tolerant solutions offer a more efficient alternative by leveraging the algorithm's structure, for instance, by incorporating erasure codes into the algorithm. Nissim, Schwartz, and Spiizer (2024) proposed an algorithm-based fault-tolerant solution for the parallel Toom-Cook algorithm. Their solution incurs minor arithmetic and communication costs overheads, but requires a considerable number of additional processors.
   We extend their methodology and introduce a fault-tolerant parallel Toom-Cook-k algorithm that significantly reduces the number of additional required processors, from (2k - 1) center dot f to f, where f is the number of tolerable simultaneous faults. Our error-correcting technique integrates Toom-Cook's inherent fault-tolerance properties and combines them with the fault-tolerant BFS-DFS method of Birnbaum et al. (2020). Our solution preserves similarly low arithmetic and communication overheads, representing a substantial improvement in the efficiency and practicality of fault-tolerant Toom-Cook algorithms.

TI Compassionate Care with Autonomous AI Humanoid Robots in Future
   Healthcare Delivery: A Multisensory Simulation of Next-Generation Models
SO BIOMIMETICS
AB The integration of AI and robotics in healthcare raises concerns, and additional issues regarding autonomous systems are anticipated. Effective communication is crucial for robots to be seen as "caring", necessitating advanced mechatronic design and natural language processing (NLP). This paper examines the potential of humanoid robots to autonomously replicate compassionate care. The study employs computational simulations using mathematical and agent-based modeling to analyze human-robot interactions (HRIs) surpassing Tetsuya Tanioka's TRETON. It incorporates stochastic elements (through neuromorphic computing) and quantum-inspired concepts (through the lens of Martha Rogers' theory), running simulations over 100 iterations to analyze complex behaviors. Multisensory simulations (visual and audio) demonstrate the significance of "dynamic communication", (relational) "entanglement", and (healthcare system and robot's function) "superpositioning" in HRIs. Quantum and neuromorphic computing may enable humanoid robots to empathetically respond to human emotions, based on Jean Watson's ten caritas processes for creating transpersonal states. Autonomous AI humanoid robots will redefine the norms of "caring". Establishing "pluralistic agreements" through open discussions among stakeholders worldwide is necessary to align innovations with the values of compassionate care within a "posthumanist" framework, where the compassionate care provided by Level 4 robots meets human expectations. Achieving compassionate care with autonomous AI humanoid robots involves translating nursing, communication, computer science, and engineering concepts into robotic care representations while considering ethical discourses through collaborative efforts. Nurses should lead the design and implementation of AI and robots guided by "technological knowing" in Rozzano Locsin's TCCN theory.

TI Fixed-point Encoding and Architecture Exploration for Residue Number
   Systems
SO ACM TRANSACTIONS ON ARCHITECTURE AND CODE OPTIMIZATION
AB Residue Number Systems (RNS) demonstrate the fascinating potential to serve integer addition/ multiplication-intensive applications. The complexity of Artificial Intelligence (AI) models has grown enormously in recent years. From a computer system's perspective, ensuring the training of these large-scale AI models within an adequate time and energy consumption has become a big concern. Matrix multiplication is a dominant subroutine in many prevailing AI models, with an addition/multiplication-intensive attribute. However, the data type of matrix multiplication within machine learning training typically requires real numbers, which indicates that RNS benefits for integer applications cannot be directly gained by AI training. The state-of-the-art RNS real-number encodings, including floating-point and fixed-point, have defects and can be further enhanced. To transform default RNS benefits to the efficiency of large-scale AI training, we propose a low-cost and high-accuracy RNS fixed-point representation: Single RNS Logical Partition (S-RNS-Logic-P) representation with Scaling-down Postprocessing Multiplication (SD-Post-Mul). . Moreover, we extend the implementation details of the other two RNS fixed-point methods: Double RNS Concatenation and S-RNS-Logic-P representation with Scaling-down Preprocessing Multiplication. . We also design the architectures of these three fixed-point multipliers. In empirical experiments, our S-RNS-Logic-P representation with SD-Post-Mul method achieves less latency and energy overhead while maintaining good accuracy. Furthermore, this method can easily extend to the Redundant Residue Number System to raise the efficiency of error-tolerant domains, such as improving the error correction efficiency of quantum computing.

TI Proximal nitrogen reduces the fluorescence quantum yield of
   nitrogen-vacancy centres in diamond
SO NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB The nitrogen-vacancy colour centre in diamond is emerging as one of the most important solid-state quantum systems. It has applications to fields including high-precision sensing, quantum computing, single photon communication, metrology, nanoscale magnetic imaging and biosensing. For all of these applications, a high quantum yield of emitted photons is desirable. However, diamond samples engineered to have high densities of nitrogen-vacancy centres show levels of brightness varying significantly within single batches, or even within the same sample. Here we show that nearby nitrogen impurities quench emission of nitrogen-vacancy centres via non-radiative transitions, resulting in a reduced fluorescence quantum yield. We monitored the emission properties of nitrogen-vacancy centre ensembles from synthetic diamond samples with different concentrations of nitrogen impurities. All samples were irradiated with high energy electrons to create high densities of nitrogen-vacancy centres relative to the concentration of nitrogen impurities. While at low nitrogen densities of 1.81 ppm we measured a lifetime of 13.9 ns, we observed a strong reduction in lifetime with increasing nitrogen density. We measure a lifetime as low as 4.4 ns at a nitrogen density of 380 ppm. The change in lifetime matches a reduction in relative fluorescence quantum yield from 77.4% to 32% with an increase in nitrogen density from 88 ppm to 380 ppm, respectively. These results will inform the conditions required to optimise the properties of diamond crystals devices based on the fluorescence of nitrogen-vacancy centres. Furthermore, this work provides insights into the origin of inhomogeneities observed in high-density nitrogen-vacancy ensembles within diamonds and nanodiamonds.

TI Ibuprofen degradation using a Co-doped carbon matrix derived from peat
   as a peroxymonosulphate activator
SO ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH
AB The wider presence of pharmaceuticals and personal care products in nature is a major cause for concern in society. Among pharmaceuticals, the anti-inflammatory drug ibuprofen has commonly been found in aquatic and soil environments. We produced a Co-doped carbon matrix (Co-P 850) through the carbonization of Co2+ saturated peat and used it as a peroxymonosulphate activator to aid ibuprofen degradation. The properties of Co-P 850 were analysed using field emission scanning electron microscopy, energy filtered transmission electron microscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. The characterization results showed that Co/Fe oxides were generated and tightly embedded into the carbon matrix after carbonization. The degradation results indicated that high temperature and slightly acidic to neutral conditions (pH = 5 to 7.5) promoted ibuprofen degradation efficiency in the Co-P 850/peroxymonosulphate system. Analysis showed that approx. 52% and 75% of the dissolved organic carbon was removed after 2 h and 5 h of reaction time, respectively. Furthermore, the existence of chloride and bicarbonate had adverse effects on the degradation of ibuprofen. Quenching experiments and electron paramagnetic resonance analysis confirmed that SO4 center dot-, (OH)-O-center dot and O-2(center dot-); radicals together contributed to the high ibuprofen degradation efficiency. In addition, we identified 13 degradation intermediate compounds and an ibuprofen degradation pathway by mass spectrometry analysis and quantum computing. Based on the results and methods presented in this study, we propose a novel way for the synthesis of a Co-doped catalyst from spent NaOH-treated peat and the efficient catalytic degradation of ibuprofen from contaminated water.

TI Hybrid Quantum-Safe Cryptographic Scheme With Secure Key Exchange and
   Signature Scheme
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB Hybrid cryptographic protocol was proposed by integrating quantum-safe algorithms (Kyber and Dilithium) together with a classical ECDSA-based signature scheme to verify secure proof on blockchain. Since quantum computers pose some loopholes in existing cryptography algorithms, the proposed mechanism addresses those vulnerabilities by maintaining compatibility with the existing infrastructure. The protocol integrates post-quantum key exchange to derive shared secrets securely. The shared secrets are used to enable hybrid encryption for efficient data protection. Additionally, the implementation uses a dual-signature approach, using quantum safe and classical signatures. These signatures are combined to ensure robust and tamper-resistant proof verification. The deployed solution validates its feasibility and efficiency for smart contract-based verification. The protocol maintains backward compatibility with existing systems while providing strong resistance to quantum attacks. Benchmark results demonstrate the system's scalability and robustness under high transaction loads, with efficient gas usage for on-chain proof validation. This approach paves the way for post-quantum secure applications, including verifiable proofs, secure key exchanges, and decentralized systems resilient to quantum adversaries.

TI Practical quantum access network over a 10 Gbit/s Ethernet passive
   optical network
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB Quantum key distribution (QKD) provides an information-theoretically secure method to share keys between legitimate users. To achieve large-scale deployment of QKD, it should be easily scalable and cost-effective. The infrastructure construction of quantum access network (QAN) expands network capacity and the integration between QKD and classical optical communications reduces the cost of channel. Here, we present a practical downstream QAN over a 10 Gbit/s Ethernet passive optical network (10G-EPON), which can support up to 64 users. In the full coexistence scheme using the single feeder fiber structure, the co-propagation of QAN and 10G-EPON signals with 9 dB attenuation is achieved over 21 km fiber, and the secure key rate for each of 16 users reaches 1.5 kbps. In the partial coexistence scheme using the dual feeder fiber structure, the combination of QAN and full-power 10G-EPON signals is achieved over 11 km with a network capacity of 64-user. The practical QAN over the 10G-EPON in our work implements an important step towards the achievement of large-scale QKD infrastructure.

TI Low-Noise InGaAs/InP Single-Photon Avalanche Diodes for Fiber-Based and
   Free-Space Applications
SO IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN QUANTUM ELECTRONICS
AB We present the design and the experimental characterization of a new InGaAs/InP single-photon avalanche diode (SPAD), with two different diameters: i) a 10 mu m device, suitable for optical fiber-based quantum applications; ii) a 25 mu mone, more appropriate for free-space applications. Compared to a previous generation, we improved the design of the double zinc diffusion and optimized the layer structure. We achieved low dark count rate, around 1 kcps and 4 kcps at 225 K and 5 V excess bias for 10 mu m and 25 mu m devices, respectively, and down to few tens of counts per seconds at 175 K for the 10 mu m detector. At 5 V excess bias and 225 K temperature, both devices also show a high photon detection efficiency (33% at 1064 nm, 31% at 1310 nm and 25% at 1550 nm for the 10 mu m SPAD). Afterpulsing has been measured with a custom readout integrated circuit, achieving very low probability values. Timing jitter is comparable to previous-generation devices.

TI Direct Laser Writing of Nucleation Sites for Patterned Diamond Growth
SO JOURNAL OF ELECTRONIC MATERIALS
AB Direct laser writing (3D printing) is rapidly emerging as a versatile method for fabricating novel 3D structures that are needed for quantum computing, superconducting devices, selective coatings, and biomedical sensors. Here, we have created 2D patterns with potential for 3D diamond structures by direct laser writing lithography, which are carbonized in an inert Ar atmosphere at 540 degrees C and then used as nucleation sites for diamond growth via hot-filament chemical vapor deposition (HFCVD). An array of 3D structures was fabricated via a two-photon polymerization process using a photo-polymeric resin on Si (100) and sapphire (0001) substrates. These 3D structures carbonized by thermal annealing show approximately 45-55% sp(3) content, as confirmed by Raman spectroscopy and x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analytical techniques. As per the end application of the device, the computer-aided design (CAD) of the structure can be modified to innovative shapes that can be carbonized to provide selective nucleation sites for placing diamond crystallites at the desired locations, which is an important component for device fabrication. The diamond crystallites show a distinctive Raman peak upshift in the range of 1333-1335 cm(-1) with a full width at half maximum of <= 5 cm(-1), indicating some strain across the diamond and Si (100) substrate. A fourfold growth morphology with {111} planes of diamond crystallites is shown by high-resolution scanning electron microscopy (HR-SEM), which correlates with the <100> growth of diamond. Additionally, we show the possibility of creating 3D structures in Q-carbon phase with embedded nanodiamond crystallites via pulsed laser annealing (PLA) of carbonized structures.

TI Gravitoelectric effect in the condensed magnetic sea
SO IET QUANTUM COMMUNICATION
AB Trapped graviton in magnetic seas induces magnetic fields as a function of time in the additional space. The Soon Joe generator made the Graviton set behave as free relativistic quantum particles. The current and voltage generated when the LED was turned on and off were measured five times. Measurements were made in units of 1/1000 of a second, and the measured data were summed. In the LED off-state, the average current was -2.87E-03 (A), and the average voltage was -1.44E-01 (V) in VH and 6.83E-01 (V) in VL. The average current in the LED on-stage was -4.28E-03, the VH was 2.14E-01, and the VL was 6.57E-01. The voltage difference was -8.27E-01 in the off-stage and -8.71E-01 in the on-stage. Less current was generated in the off-stage, with less voltage difference. In this experiment, we confirmed that the graviton generates the current, and with the photons, more current is generated. This explains why the interactive induction protocol of gravitons or photons can be used to experiment with the magnetic field's ability to communicate or transfer energy with relativistic quantum particles. The gravitoelectric effect explains the photoelectric effect elements, and graviton has induced electricity as a physical entity in the magnetic sea.
   The Soon Joe generator produced a certain amount of electricity in the dark stationary state. Gravity or gravitational wave can induce the magnetic seas because gravitons captured in the magnetic seas should induce the gravitoelectric effect without the photoelectric effects. As a result, we formulated a new law for magnetism on Earth.image

TI Influence of Hydrophobicity on Excitonic Coupling in DNA-Templated
   Indolenine Squaraine Dye Aggregates
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY C
AB Control over the strength of excitonic coupling in molecular dye aggregates is a substantial factor for the development of technologies such as light harvesting, optoelectronics, and quantum computing. According to the molecular exciton model, the strength of excitonic coupling is inversely proportional to the distance between dyes. Covalent DNA templating was proved to be a versatile tool to control dye spacing on a subnanometer scale. To further expand our ability to control photophysical properties of excitons, here, we investigated the influence of dye hydrophobicity on the strength of excitonic coupling in squaraine aggregates covalently templated by DNA Holliday Junction (DNA HJ). Indolenine squaraines were chosen for their excellent spectral properties, stability, and diversity of chemical modifications. Six squaraines of varying hydrophobicity from highly hydrophobic to highly hydrophilic were assembled in two dimer configurations and a tetramer. In general, the examined squaraines demonstrated a propensity toward face-to-face aggregation behavior observed via steady-state absorption, fluorescence, and circular dichroism spectroscopies. Modeling based on the Kuhn-Renger-May approach quantified the strength of excitonic coupling in the squaraine aggregates. The strength of excitonic coupling strongly correlated with squaraine hydrophobic region. Dimer aggregates of dichloroindolenine squaraine were found to exhibit the strongest coupling strength of 132 meV (1065 cm(-1)). In addition, we identified the sites for dye attachment in the DNA HJ that promote the closest spacing between the dyes in their dimers. The extracted aggregate geometries, and the role of electrostatic and steric effects in squaraine aggregation are also discussed. Taken together, these findings provide a deeper insight into how dye structures influence excitonic coupling in dye aggregates covalently templated via DNA, and guidance in design rules for exciton-based materials and devices.

Despite its promising benefits in the current production landscape, Industry 5.0 faces critical challenges in scalability, workforce transition to collaborate with advanced technologies, high production costs, and privacy and security challenges in the post-quantum era. Thus, necessitates a shift towards more advanced Industrial paradigm that modernize and reinvent operations to synergize with high end sustainable and scalable machineries, products and processes. Industry 6.0 is defined as ubiquitous, hyper-customer driven, virtualized, and sustainable manufacturing, where focus is towards hyper-connected factories and dynamic supply chains. Industry 6.0 is expected to connect cross-vertical applications, and in this paper, we present a tutorial-based survey on the vision, technical landscape, and advancements which would drive the Industry 6.0. New concepts are introduced over Industry 5.0 processes to support industrial applications like supply-chain based productions, human-robotic industrial pipelines, green computing, and generative artificial intelligence (GAI) induction in control processes. We highlight the key enablers to support the 6.0 vision-automated digital twins, metaverseassisted virtual production, 6G, dew computing, GAI Cobots Networks (GOBOTs), Internet-of-Anything (IoX), quantum-assisted nano production, and other technologies. We highlight the reference architecture, Industry 6.0 vision, features, components, and the threats surrounding Industry 6.0, and solutions. We also present the sustainability aspects of Industry 6.0, and finally discuss future challenges and directions. The article is presented to assist researchers, industry practitioners, and allied stakeholders to design cost-effective, customized, and process driven Industrial operations.

TI Introducing a Novel Controller for Combined Load Frequency Control and
   Automatic Voltage Regulation of Interconnected Microgrids
SO IET RENEWABLE POWER GENERATION
AB The microgrid exhibits low inertia levels and small X/R ratios. Consequently, load changes can adversely affect microgrid stability. However, frequency and voltage oscillations can be mitigated through the use of a load frequency control (LFC) system and an automatic voltage regulator (AVR), which serve as secondary control mechanisms. Additionally, the integration of photovoltaic (PV) and wind turbine (WT) in microgrids complicates the performance of LFC and voltage control due to the uncertainties associated with these renewable sources. Therefore, it is essential to employ a suitable controller with optimal parameters. To address this, this paper introduces a novel control technique known as the tilt-proportional-integral-derivative second-order derivative controller (TPIDD2) to concurrently manage the voltage and frequency of microgrids. It also incorporates an intelligent optimisation algorithm integrated with quantum computing, referred to as quantum teaching-learning-based optimisation (QTLBO), to achieve optimal control parameters. The test system consists of a two-area interconnected microgrid, where each area includes various sources such as PV, WT, fuel cell (FC), diesel generator, and battery energy storage system (BESS). The integral of time multiplied by the squared error (ITSE) is utilised as the objective function. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed controller, it is compared with the proportional-integral-derivative (PID) controller. From the ITSE perspective, the proposed controller is 71.96% more effective than the PID controller. Furthermore, the results obtained using QTLBO are contrasted with those from teaching-learning based optimization (TLBO), differential evolution (DE), and RCGA.

TI A Processing and Analytics System for Microscopy Data Workflows: The
   Pycroscopy Ecosystem of Packages
SO ADVANCED THEORY AND SIMULATIONS
AB Major advancements in fields as diverse as biology and quantum computing have relied on a multitude of microscopy techniques. Despite the considerable proliferation of these instruments, significant bottlenecks remain in terms of processing, analysis, storage, and retrieval of the acquired datasets. Aside from lack of file standards, individual domain-specific analysis packages are often disjoint from the underlying datasets, and thus keeping track of analysis and processing steps remains tedious for the end-user, hampering reproducibility. Here, the pycroscopy ecosystem of packages is introduced, an open-source python-based ecosystem underpinned by a common data model. The data model, termed the N-dimensional spectral imaging data format, is realized in pycroscopy's sidpy package. This package is built on top of dask arrays, thus leveraging dask array attributes, but expanding them to accelerate microscopy relevant analysis and visualization. Several examples of the use of the pycroscopy ecosystem to create workflows for data ingestion and analysis of scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) and scanning probe microscopy data are shown. Adoption of such standardized routines will be critical to usher in the next generation of autonomous instruments where processing, computation, and meta-data storage will be critical to overall experimental operations.
   The pycroscopy ecosystem of packages enables ingestion, machine learning and statistical analysis, processing, and visualization of a large variety of microscopy data from many different vendors in a reproducible and accessible fashion. This ecosystem enables rapid generation of analytical workflows that can form the basis of autonomous laboratories leveraging experiments with computation and simulations for physical discovery.image

TI Quantum Firefly Secure Routing for Fog Based Wireless Sensor Networks
SO INTELLIGENT AUTOMATION AND SOFT COMPUTING
AB Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) become an integral part of Internet of Things (IoT) and finds their applicability in several domains. As classical WSN faces several issues in service-based IoT applications, fog computing has been introduced in real-time, enabling local data processing and avoid raw data transmission to cloud servers. The Fog-based WSN generally involves advanced nodes, normal nodes, and some Fog Nodes (FN). Though the Fog-based WSN offers several benefits, there is a need to develop an effective trust-based secure routing protocol for data transmission among Cluster Heads (CHs) and FNs. In this view, this paper presents a Quantum Firefly Optimization based Multi -Objective Secure Routing (QFO-MOSR) protocol for Fog-based WSN. The main intention of the QFO-MOSR technique is to derive an optimal selection of routes between CHs and FNs in the network. The QFO-MOSR technique has incorporated the concepts of quantum computing and Firefly (FF) optimization algorithm inspired by the flashing behaviour of FFs. In addition, a multi-objective fitness function is derived by the QFO-MOSR technique using seven objectives: distance, inter-cluster distance, energy, delay, intra-cluster distance, link lifetime, and trust. The proposed routing technique derives a fitness function including trust factor from ensuring security. The design of the QFO-MOSR technique with a multi-objective fitness function shows the novelty of the work. To validate the performance of the QFO-MOSR technique, a series of experiments were carried out, and the results are investigated in terms of different measures. The experimental analysis ensured that the QFO-MOSR technique is superior to other methods in terms of different measures.

This review examines the preparation, characterization, and potential applications of lanthanide compounds in these unusual oxidation states. Experimental methods discussed include advanced techniques such as infrared spectroscopy, ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy, X-ray absorption near edge structure, and electron paramagnetic resonance, which facilitate the indepth analysis of the physicochemical properties of these compounds. Stabilization mechanisms, including ligand effects, electronic interactions, and geometric factors, are also explored. Notably, the stabilization of Ln(I)-based clusters is attributed to B82- ligand interactions, symmetry transitions (Cs -> C7v), and electronic delocalization effects. Lanthanide(II) complexes, synthesized via salt metathesis, reductive pathways, and transmetalation, are stabilized by ligands such as N-heterocyclic carbenes, cyclopentadienyl, and silylamide derivatives, with reductions using potassium graphite enabling their isolation in solvents like toluene and THF. These complexes exhibit diverse geometries, including bent metallocenes and distorted octahedral structures, with 18-crown-6 facilitating unique coordination environments, making them valuable for catalysis, quantum computing, bioimaging, and OLED applications. Ln(IV) species, such as Tb(IV) and Pr(IV) complexes, exhibit enhanced covalency through electron rich siloxide and phosphinimine ligands, with ligand-field stabilization energies rationalized via density functional theory calculations. The +V oxidation state, observed in PrO2+ and (eta 2-O2)PrO2, has been confirmed through gas-phase ionization experiments, revealing Pr---N and Pr--O bonds. These findings expand the understanding of lanthanide chemistry and open avenues for innovative applications in catalysis, medicine, materials science, and environmental monitoring.

TI A Deep Quantum Convolutional Neural Network Based Facial Expression
   Recognition For Mental Health Analysis
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON NEURAL SYSTEMS AND REHABILITATION ENGINEERING
AB The purpose of this work is to analyze how new technologies can enhance clinical practice while also examining the physical traits of emotional expressiveness of face expression in a number of psychiatric illnesses. Hence, in this work, an automatic facial expression recognition system has been proposed that analyzes static, sequential, or video facial images from medical healthcare data to detect emotions in people's facial regions. The proposed method has been implemented in five steps. The first step is image preprocessing, where a facial region of interest has been segmented from the input image. The second component includes a classical deep feature representation and the quantum part that involves successive sets of quantum convolutional layers followed by random quantum variational circuits for feature learning. Here, the proposed system has attained a faster training approach using the proposed quantum convolutional neural network approach that takes O(log (n)). In contrast, the classical convolutional neural network models have O(n(2)) time. Additionally, some performance improvement techniques, such as image augmentation, fine-tuning, matrix normalization, and transfer learning methods, have been applied to the recognition system. Finally, the scores due to classical and quantum deep learning models are fused to improve the performance of the proposed method. Extensive experimentation with Karolinska-directed emotional faces (KDEF), Static Facial Expressions in the Wild (SFEW 2.0), and Facial Expression Recognition 2013 (FER-2013) benchmark databases and compared with other state-of-the-art methods that show the improvement of the proposed system.

TI An automatic and intelligent brain tumor detection using Lee sigma
   filtered histogram segmentation model
SO SOFT COMPUTING
AB Brain tumors are the second important origin of death worldwide. The early and exact identification of brain tumors is significant for the healing process. With accelerating diagnoses, medicine as well as pricing, quantum computing permits disruptive cases to providers. Quantum improved deep learning was especially significant to the sector. However, the conventional machine learning method faces main challenges to achieve accurate brain tumor detection with MRI images. Therefore, this paper proposes a novel technique called Lee sigma filtered histogram segmentation (LSFHS) for accurately detecting brain tumors with minimal time consumption. LSFHS technique is based on preprocessing, segmentation, feature extraction and classification. Input MRI image is preprocessed using adaptive Lee sigma filter in the first hidden layer to minimize noise significantly. In hidden layer 2, gray bimodal histogram segmentation is performed to partition a preprocessed image into a number of segments. Multiple features are extracted from the input image in the third hidden layer. Output layer uses the TanH activation function to match extracted features with disease features for detecting brain tumors. Experimental evaluation is carried out on factors, namely peak signal-to-noise ratio, tumor detection accuracy, error rate and tumor detection with a number of MRI images. The results illustrate LSFHS technique increases tumor detection accuracy by 14% and 25% faster tumor detection time, and reduces the error rate by 58% compared to state-of-the-art works. Qualitative and quantitative results illustrate that our proposed LSFHS technique attains greater performance than state-of-the-art methods. LSFHS technique is designed to detect brain tumors at an earlier stage with higher tumor detection accuracy and less time.

TI Quantum-inspired complex convolutional neural networks
SO APPLIED INTELLIGENCE
AB Quantum-inspired artificial neural network is an interesting research area, which combines quantum computing and deep learning. Several models of quantum-inspired neuron with real-valued weights have been proposed, and they were mainly used to build the three-layer feedforward neural networks. In this work, we improve the convolutional neural networks (CNNs) by utilizing the quantum-inspired way of data representation and convolutional operation. Specifically, we first improve the quantum-inspired neuron by exploiting the complex-valued weights, which have richer representational capacity and better non-linearity. Moreover, we extend the method implementing the quantum-inspired neurons to perform convolutional operations, and naturally draw the models of quantum-inspired convolutional neural networks (QICNNs) capable of processing high-dimensional data. Here five specific types of QICNNs are proposed, which are different in the way of implementing the convolutional layers and fully connected layers. We establish the detail mathematical framework to implement the QICNNs. The performances of accuracy, convergence and robustness of the five QICNNs against the classical counterpart are tested using the MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets. The results show that (1) the QICNN can achieve higher classification accuracy (up to 99.65%) than the classical CNN when using the MNIST dataset; (2) the QICNN has faster convergence speed, which means that QICNN can be trained easily than classical CNN when they have a similar number of parameters; (3) the QICNN has better robustness in the case of employing different way of weight initialization or rotating the input data. It is expected that our QICNNs can outperform the classical counterparts in more practical learning tasks.

TI Simulation of High-Efficiency Resonant-Cavity-Enhanced GeSn
   Single-Photon Avalanche Photodiodes for Sensing and Optical Quantum
   Applications
SO IEEE SENSORS JOURNAL
AB Two novel resonant-cavity-enhanced (RCE) GeSn single-photon avalanche photodiode (SPAD) detectors are designed and simulated for high-efficiency single-photon detection at 1550 and 2000 nm wavelength at room temperature for sensing and optical quantum applications. The RCE GeSn SPAD consists of a PIPIN GeSn/Si heterostructures embedded in an optical cavity formed by a distributed Bragg reflector (DBR) and GeSn surface. The results show that high photon absorption efficiency and avalanche triggering probabilities can be achieved by careful design of DBR reflectors, GeSn absorber, doping concentrations of Si charge sheet layer and multiplication layer, which lead to a high single-photon detection efficiency (SPDE) of similar to 80%, which is promising for emerging quantum applications demanding high SPDE, such as linear optical quantum computing. The noise equivalent power (NEP) and dark count rate (DCR) as a function of threading dislocations density (TDD) are examined as well. It is found that the device could operate near room temperature with a similar DCR level to that of Ge SPAD operating at low temperature. A NEP of similar to 3 x 10(-15) W/Hz(1/2) is observed from RCE GeSn SPAD for 1550 nm wavelength at room temperature. This work shows that the proposed RCE GeSn SPADs are promising candidates for high-efficiency single-photon detection in short-wave infrared (SWIR) regime for sensing and optical quantum applications.

TI Simple formulation of no-cloning and no-hiding that admits efficient and
   robust verification
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Incompatibility is a feature of quantum theory that sets it apart from classical theory, and the inability to clone an unknown quantum state is one of the most fundamental instances. The no-hiding theorem is another such instance that arises in the context of the black-hole information paradox, and can be viewed as being dual to no-cloning. Here, we formulate both of these fundamental features of quantum theory in a single form that is amenable to efficient verification, and that is robust to errors arising in state preparation and measurements. We extend the notion of unitarity-an average figure of merit that for quantum theory captures the coherence of a quantum channel-to general physical theories. Then, we introduce the notion of compatible unitarity pair (CUP) sets, that correspond to the allowed values of unitarities for compatible channels in the theory. We show that a CUP set constitutes a simple "fingerprint" of a physical theory, and that incompatibility can be studied through them. We derive information-disturbance constraints on quantum CUP sets that encode both the no-cloning/broadcasting and no-hiding theorems of quantum theory. We then develop randomized benchmarking protocols that efficiently estimate quantum CUP sets and provide simulations using IBMQ of the simplest instance. Finally, we discuss ways in which CUP sets and quantum no-go theorems could provide additional information to benchmark quantum devices.

TI Experimental Full-Domain Mapping of Quantum Correlation in
   Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt Scenarios
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW APPLIED
AB Quantum correlation between two parties serves as a useful resource in the surging applications of quan-tum information. The Bell nonlocality and quantum steering have been proposed to describe nonclassicalcorrelations against local-hidden-variable and local-hidden-state theories, respectively. To characterizethe two types of nonclassical correlations, various nonlocality and steering inequalities have been estab-lished, and the amount of inequality violation serves as a helpful indicator for many entanglement-basedtasks. Quantum state tomography has been employed for measuring quantum states, while the methodrequires intensive computation and does not directly verify either nonlocality or steering over the fulldomain independent of established theories. Here, we experimentally map the full-domain correlationwith bipartite states for nonlocality and quantum steering in Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt scenarios. Themeasurement of the maps automatically accounts for detection imperfections. Furthermore, we demon-strate the application of the correlation maps in the entanglement-based quantum key distribution protocolwith arbitrary bipartite states. The correlation maps show direct measurements and simple interpretationsthat can answer fundamental questions about nonlocality and quantum steering as well as contribute toquantum information applications in a straightforward manner.

TI Optical fibre-based quantum random number generator: stochastic
   modelling and measurements
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB In this work, we present a study of a quantum random number generation system based on a branching path approach with spatial superposition principle, realised using fibre optics. The analysis of the experimental system was supported by the development of a stochastic model of the entropy source, which, to the best of the authors' knowledge, has not yet been properly described. This resulted in the analytical equations for the probability of possible output quantum states depending on the initial properties of the system. Based on the presented model, the quantum efficiency and the Shannon entropy were calculated and compared with experimentally obtained values, which resulted in full agreement between these data. Additional statistical tests were performed on random numbers obtained theoretically and experimentally to confirm their high degree of randomness and their usability in cryptographic applications. The fact that the developed system is based on fibre optics allows it to operate in stable conditions with a final efficiency at the level of 15%, which provides a random number generation rate of about 8 kb/s. The developed system is used as an input to the quantum key distribution system, which has possible applications in cryptography or military and commercial secure communications.

TI Efficient quantum digital signatures over long distances with likely bit
   strings
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW APPLIED
AB Quantum digital signatures (QDSs) can provide information -theoretic security of messages against forgery and repudiation. Compared with previous QDS protocols that focus on signing one -bit messages, hash function-based QDS protocols can save quantum resources and are able to sign messages of arbitrary length. Using the idea of likely bit strings, we propose an efficient QDS protocol with hash functions over long distances. Our method of likely bit strings can be applied to any quantum key distribution-based QDS protocol to significantly improve the signature rate and dramatically increase the secure signature distance of QDS protocols. In order to save computing resources, we propose an improved method where Alice participates in the verification process of Bob and Charlie. This eliminates the computational complexity relating to the huge number of all likely strings. We demonstrate the advantages of our method and our improved method with the example of sending -or -not -sending QDS. Under typical parameters, both our method and our improved method can improve the signature rate by more than 100 times and increase the signature distance by about 150 km compared with hash function-based QDS protocols without likely bit strings.

TI A New Memory-Processing Unit Model Based on Spiking Neural P Systems
   with Dendritic and Synaptic Behavior for Kronecker Matrix-Matrix
   Multiplication
SO MATHEMATICS
AB Currently, Kronecker Matrix-Matrix Multiplication play a crucial role in many advanced applications across science and engineering, such as Quantum Computing (Tensor Representation of Quantum States, Quantum Gate Construction), Machine Learning and Data Science (Kernel Methods, Tensor Decompositions), and Signal and Image Processing (Multi-dimensional Filtering, Compression Algorithms). However, the implementation of the Kronecker Matrix-Matrix Multiplication increasingly relies on systems with enhanced computational capabilities. Specifically, current implementations expend large amounts of external memory and requires a large number of processing units to perform this operation. As is commonly acknowledged, cutting-edge high-performance computing schemes still faces limitations in terms of energy and performance due to the bottleneck in data transfer between processing units and memory. To mitigate this limitation, memory processing units (MPUs) enable direct computation on in-memory data, reducing latency and eliminating the need for data transfer. On the other hand, spiking neural P systems, with their inherent parallelism and distributed processing capabilities, are therefore well-suited as foundational components for implementing such memory architectures efficiently. From the mathematical point of view, we present for the first time a neural, synaptic, and dendritic model to support the Kronecker Matrix-Matrix multiplication. To this end, the proposed spiking neural P system with their cutting-edge variants, such as anti-spikes, communication on request, synaptic weights, and dendritic-axonal delays, facilitates the creation of neural memory cells and spike-based routers. Hence, these elements potentially allow the design of novel processing memory architectures that markedly enhance data transfer efficiency between computational units and memory.

TI Alternating MSA and Mo-QEA to Design Slow-Time Coded PRF-Set in
   Pulse-Doppler Radar
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB In this paper, we propose a novel framework based on a multivariable hybrid optimization algorithm that integrates single-objective modified simulated annealing (MSA) and multi-objective quantum-inspired evolutionary algorithm (Mo-QEA) layers based on the impact of the slow-time phase coding for minimizing unwanted signals at the output of matching filters, on the frequency spectrum of pulsed-Doppler radars. Slow-time codes alter the spectrum's structure and result in increasing the blind areas within the blind-zone map (BZM). The hybrid framework comprises two layers that identify the optimum pulse repetition frequency (PRF) set and slow-time code by considering spectrum disturbances. The first layer employs the MSA for PRF set optimization. Modifications to the SA include restructured loops based on the perturbation functions. The outer loop considers the overall PRF set structure (overall direction and step-ODS), while the inner loop conducts a sequential search based on the cost function's standard deviation and small increments. The output of this layer serves as the foundation for the subsequent layer, where the phase sequence of each PRF is optimized to concurrently minimize blind areas due to the M of N criterion and grating lobes through Mo-QEA. Innovations are mutation-like operators and tournament selection to enhance the diversity of generated solutions, alongside rotation gates in quantum computing. Our research highlights a previously unexplored relationship between BZM and slow-time coding, demonstrating improved performance for each layer compared to existing studies.

TI Direct ultrafast carrier imaging in a perovskite microlaser with optical
   coherence microscopy
SO OPTICA
AB Nanophotonics is an actively developing field of optics that finds application in various areas, from biosensing to quantum computing. The study of ultrafast modulation of the refractive index Delta is an important task in nanophotonics, since it reveals the features of light-matter interaction inside devices. With the development of active photonic devices such as emitters and modulators, there is a growing need for Delta n imaging techniques with both high spatial and high temporal resolutions. Here, we report on an all-optical ultrafast Delta n imaging method based on phase-sensitive optical coherence microscopy with a resolution of 1 ps in time and 0.5 mu m in space and a sensitivity to Delta n down to 10(-3) RIU. The advantages of the method are demonstrated on emerging nanophotonic devices-perovskite microlasers, in which the ultrafast spatiotemporal dynamics of the refractive index during lasing is quantitatively visualized, illustrating the features of relaxation and diffusion of carriers in perovskites. The developed method allows us to estimate the ultrafast carrier diffusion and relaxation constants simultaneously and to show that the CsPbBr3 perovskite carrier diffusion coefficient is low compared to other semiconductors even during lasing at high carrier densities, which leads to high localization of the generated carrier cloud, and, consequently, to high fluorescence and lasing efficiency. The resulting technique is a versatile method for studying ultrafast carrier transport via Delta n imaging, paving an avenue for the applications of optical coherence tomography and microscopy in the research of nanophotonic devices and materials.

TI Alternating-bias assisted annealing of amorphous oxide tunnel junctions
SO COMMUNICATIONS MATERIALS
AB Superconducting quantum bits (qubits) rely on ultra-thin, amorphous oxide tunneling barriers that can have significant inhomogeneities and defects as grown. This can result in relatively large uncertainties and deleterious effects in the circuits, limiting the scalability. Finding a robust solution to the junction reproducibility problem has been a long-standing goal in the field. Here, we demonstrate a transformational technique for controllably tuning the electrical properties of aluminum-oxide tunnel junctions. This is accomplished using a low-voltage, alternating-bias applied individually to the tunnel junctions, with which resistance tuning by more than 70% can be achieved. The data indicates an improvement of coherence and reduction of two-level system defects. Transmission electron microscopy shows that the treated junctions are predominantly amorphous, albeit with a more uniform distribution of alumina coordination across the barrier. This technique is expected to be useful for other devices based on ionic amorphous materials.
   Amorphous aluminum oxide tunnel junctions are important for cryogenic and room temperature devices. Here, the authors demonstrate the use of alternating-bias-assisted annealing for transforming and tuning transmon qubit junctions, where giant increases in excess of 70% in the room temperature resistance can be achieved.

TI Investigation of plasma cell-free DNA as a potential biomarker in horses
SO JOURNAL OF VETERINARY DIAGNOSTIC INVESTIGATION
AB Plasma cell-free DNA (cfDNA) is a biomarker of ischemia, systemic inflammation, and mortality in humans with gastrointestinal disease. Cell-free DNA has not been investigated as a biomarker for equine colic, to our knowledge. We hypothesized that cfDNA could be measured accurately in neat equine plasma using a benchtop fluorometer and that plasma cfDNA would be elevated in emergency patients compared to healthy horses. Plasma was obtained from blood collected in Roche DNA stabilizing tubes. We used the Qubit 4 fluorometer and 1x dsDNA HS assay kit to measure cfDNA concentration in neat patient plasma and following DNA extraction of plasma with a commercial kit. Assay precision and linearity of dilution were satisfactory for neat plasma cfDNA, but DNA spike and recovery results were variable. Further, cfDNA concentrations in paired neat plasma and extracted-plasma samples (n = 66) were not correlated. Median extracted-plasma cfDNA was higher in emergency patients (n = 50) and a subgroup of colic patients (n = 36), compared to healthy horses (n = 19). Our results with extracted-plasma samples provide proof of concept for further investigation of plasma cfDNA as a biomarker in horses.

TI Local indistinguishability and incompleteness of entangled orthogonal
   bases: Method to generate two-element locally indistinguishable
   ensembles
SO ANNALS OF PHYSICS
AB We relate the phenomenon of local indistinguishability of orthogonal states with the properties of unextendibility and un-completability of entangled bases for bipartite and multipartite quantum systems. We prove that all two-qubit unextendible entangled bases are of size three and they cannot be perfectly distinguished by separable measurements. We identify a method of constructing two-element orthogonal ensembles, based on the concept of unextendible entangled bases, that can potentially lead to information sharing applications. Two-element ensembles form the fundamental unit of ensembles, and yet does not offer locally indistinguishable ensembles for pure state elements. Going over to mixed states does open this possibility, but can be difficult to identify. The method provided using unextendible entangled bases can be used for their systematic generation. In multipartite systems, we find a class of unextendible entangled bases for which the unextendibility property remains conserved across all bipartitions. We also identify nonlocal operations, local implementation of which require entangled resource states from a higher-dimensional quantum system. (C) 2021 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

   using spiders
SO ELECTRONIC PROCEEDINGS IN THEORETICAL COMPUTER SCIENCE
CT Electronic Proceedings in Theoretical Computer Science
CY SEP 08-10, 2021
CL Hagenberg, AUSTRIA
AB We give a complete presentation for the fragment, ZX &, of the ZX-calculus generated by the Z and X spiders (corresponding to copying and addition) along with the not gate and the and gate. To prove completeness, we freely add a unit and counit to the category TOF generated by the Toffoli gate and ancillary bits, showing that this yields the full subcategory of finite ordinals and functions with objects powers of two; and then perform a two way translation between this category and ZX &. A translation to some extension of TOF, as opposed to some fragment of the ZX-calculus, is a natural choice because of the multiplicative nature of the Toffoli gate. To this end, we show that freely adding counits to the semi-Frobenius algebras of a discrete inverse category is the same as constructing the Cartesian completion. In particular, for a discrete inverse category, the category of classical channels, the Cartesian completion and adding counits all produce the same category. Therefore, applying these constructions to TOF produces the full subcategory of finite ordinals and partial maps with objects powers of two. By glueing together the free counit completion and the free unit completion, this yields "qubit multirelations."

TI A Quantum-Inspired Hybrid Artificial Neural Network for Identifying the
   Dynamic Parameters of Mobile Car-Like Robots
SO MATHEMATICS
AB Accurate prediction of a robot's dynamic parameters, including mass and moment of inertia, is essential for adequate motion planning and control in autonomous systems. Traditional methods often depend on manual computation or physics-based modelling, which can be time-consuming and approximate for intricate, real-world environments. Recent advances in machine learning, primarily through artificial neural networks (ANNs), offer profitable alternatives. However, the potential of quantum-inspired models in this context remains largely uncharted. The current research assesses the predictive performance of a classical artificial neural network (CANN) and a quantum-inspired artificial neural network (QANN) in estimating a car-like mobile robot's mass and moment of inertia. The predictive accurateness of the models was considered by minimizing a cost function, which was characterized as the RMSE between the predicted and actual values. The outcomes indicate that while both models demonstrated commendable performance, QANN consistently surpassed CANN. On average, QANN achieved a 9.7% reduction in training RMSE, decreasing from 0.0031 to 0.0028, and an 84.4% reduction in validation RMSE, dropping from 0.125 to 0.0195 compared to CANN. These enhancements highlight QANN's singular predictive accuracy and greater capacity for generalization to unseen data. In contrast, CANN displayed overfitting tendencies, especially during the training phase. These findings emphasize the significance of quantum-inspired neural networks in enhancing prediction precision for involved regression tasks. The QANN framework has the potential for wider applications in robotics, including autonomous vehicles, uncrewed aerial vehicles, and intelligent automation systems, where accurate dynamic modelling is necessary.

TI Robust Inverse Quantum Fourier Transform Inspired Algorithm for
   Unsupervised Image Segmentation
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB Image segmentation is a crucial task in computer vision. In this study, we propose a method based on inverse quantum Fourier transform (IQFT) and develop a robust IQFT-inspired algorithm for unsupervised image segmentation. The proposed method leverages the underlying mathematical mechanism of the IQFT to cluster the input image pixels automatically and efficiently into different segments. Specifically, by considering the correlation between the within-cluster mean sum of squared error (MSSE) and the probability of quantum measurements, the proposed robust algorithm significantly improves the segmentation performance. It is an unsupervised method with characteristics similar to k-means, i.e., the proposed method does not require training. Extensive evaluation of the proposed method has been carried out, showing that it outperforms the classical k-means on the PASCAL VOC 2012 segmentation benchmark by as much as 4.21%, the Flowers dataset by as much as 4.4%, and the xVIEW2 challenge dataset by as much as 11.1% in terms of Intersection-Over-Union (IoU). It is also demonstrated that the proposed method has comparable or mixed performance compared to recent more complex approaches. However, compared to approaches such as GrabCut, which require a measure of the user interaction, and deep learning-based methods, which require generative models and deep feature extraction algorithms, the proposed method does not require training or user involvement. This makes it a promising choice for applications that do not have access to data before deployment or have very limited training data.

TI Frontiers in atomic-level manufacturing: atomic-scale electrochemical
   deposition
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF EXTREME MANUFACTURING
AB Atomic-level manufacturing, as the "keystone" of future technology, marks the transformative shift from the micro/nano era based on "classical theory" to the atomic era grounded in "quantum theory". It enables the precise control of matter arrangement and composition at the atomic scale, thereby achieving large-scale production of atomically precise and structured products. Electrochemical deposition (ECD), a typical "atom addition" fabrication method for electrochemical atomic and close-to-atomic scale manufacturing (EC-ACSM), enables precise control over material properties at the atomic scale, allowing breakthroughs in revolutionary performance of semiconductors, quantum computing, new materials, nanomedicine, etc. This review explores the fundamentals of EC-ACSM, particularly at the electrode/electrolyte interface, and investigates maskless ECD techniques, highlighting their advantages, limitations, and the role of in situ monitoring and advanced simulations in the process optimization. However, atomic electrochemical deposition faces significant challenges in precise control over atom-ion interactions, electrode-electrolyte interfacial dynamics, and surface defects. In the future, overcoming these obstacles is critical to advancing EC-ACSM and unlocking its full potential in scalability for industrial applications. EC-ACSM can drive the highly customized design of materials and offer strong technological support for the development of future science, ushering in a new atomic era of material innovation and device manufacturing.
   The fundamentals and the technological advancements of atomic-scale electrochemical deposition are summarized.In situ monitoring techniques for atomic-scale electrode/electrolyte interfacial dynamics are addressed.Atomic simulations are investigated for understanding the electrochemical process at the atomic and electron scales.The advanced applications, future development directions, and challenges of atomic-scale electrochemical deposition are outlined.

TI Observation of Topological Chirality Switching Induced Freezing of a
   Skyrmion Crystal
SO ADVANCED MATERIALS
AB Magnetic skyrmions are topologically protected quasi-particles with a well-defined chirality. Control over their chirality is proposed as an additional feature for encoding data bits or as qubits in quantum computing due to their high efficiency and stability against achiral magnetic textures. Here it is shown that an in-plane magnetic field can be utilized to reshape the energy barriers between different skyrmionic bubbles (e.g., Bloch type, type-II) enabling spontaneous chirality fluctuations with a frequency that increases with the strength of the in-plane field. The insulating van der Waals ferromagnet CrBr3 is used as an archetypal system for low damping, reduced energy dissipation and a high number of magnetic phases to capture the chirality dynamics in real time through cryo-Lorentz transmission electron microscopy. It is observed that the interplay between the intrinsic Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction and out-of-plane field biased the chirality dynamics, favoring one handedness over the other. A remarkable consequence of the spontaneous chirality switching mechanism is that it induces a freezing (or crystallization) process in the skyrmion lattice. As the bubbles fluctuate between Bloch and type-II they elongate and shrink parallel to the in-plane field. Subsequently, the overall lattice crystallizes along the in-plane field direction, inducing a phase transition from a disordered liquid state to a hexatic phase where skyrmions are highly ordered resembling that of a solid. The results indicate chirality as an active element in the creation of topologically protected skyrmion crystals unveiling pathways toward chiral spintronic device platforms with tunable embedded configuration.

TI Bulk nonlinear metamaterials for generation of quantum light
SO APPLIED PHYSICS REVIEWS
AB Quantum states of light, such as fixed photon number (Fock) states, entangled states, and squeezed states, offer important advantages with respect to classical states of light, such as coherent states and thermal states, in different areas: they enable secure communication and distribution of encryption keys, enable realization of sensors with higher sensitivity and resolution, and are considered candidates for quantum computing and simulation applications. To accommodate these applications, suitable methods for generating the quantum states are needed. Today, the quantum states are often produced by a spontaneous nonlinear process in a standard nonlinear material, followed by a series of optical elements necessary for encoding the desired state on the generated photons. In this review, we consider an alternative approach of structuring the nonlinearity of the crystal so that the desired quantum state will be generated directly at the crystal, without the need for additional elements. Our main focus here is on bulk crystals having structured second-order nonlinearity. The rising interest in these nonlinear metamaterials is fueled by advancements in the ability to efficiently simulate and design spontaneous parametric downconversion (SPDC) processes, as well as by new capabilities of structuring the nonlinearity of ferroelectric crystals, either by electric field poling or by laser-induced writing. As a result, nonlinear metamaterials were recently used to directly shape the spatial and spectral correlations of quantum light that is generated in SPDC. The paper covers the theoretical background and the design and fabrication methods of bulk nonlinear metamaterials for generating quantum light, as well as a series of demonstrations of the use of metamaterials in quantum optical applications.

TI Security of image transfer and innovative results for
   (p,q)-Bernstein-Schurer p,q )-Bernstein-Schurer operators
SO AIMS MATHEMATICS
AB With the advent of quantum computing, traditional cryptography algorithms are at risk of being broken. Post-quantum encryption algorithms, developed to include mathematical challenges to make it impossible for quantum computers to solve problems, are constantly being updated to ensure that sensitive information is protected from potential threats. In this study, a hybrid examination of a (p,q)-Bernstein-type p,q )-Bernstein-type polynomial, which is an argument that can be used for encryption algorithms with a post-quantum approach, was made from a mathematical and cryptography perspective. In addition, we have aimed to present a new useful operator that approximates functions and can be used in cases where it is not possible to work with functions in the fields of technology, medicine, and engineering. Based on this idea, a new version of the (p,q)-Bernstein-Schurer p,q )-Bernstein-Schurer operator was introduced in our study on a variable interval and the convergence rate was calculated with two different methods. At the same time, the applications of the theoretical situation in the study were presented with the help of visual illustrations and tables related to the approach. Additionally, our operator satisfied the statistical-type Korovkin theorem and is suitable for variable interval approximation. This is the first paper to study the statistical convergence properties of (p,q)-Bernstein-Schurer p,q )-Bernstein-Schurer operators defined on a variable bounded interval, to obtain special matrices with the help of (p,q)-basis p,q )-basis functions, and to give an application of (p,q)-type p,q )-type operators for encrypted image transmission.

TI Quantum bit error rate timing jitter dependency on multi-mode fibers
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB The full time-jitter response of a single-photon detector can make a significant contribution to the quantum bit error rate (QBER) of high repetition rate quantum key distribution (QKD) implementations. Although there have been studies into understanding the contribution for single-mode optical fiber coupled single-photon detectors, the contribution of larger, multimode core diameters to the QBER have not been explored in detail. With the growing importance of free-space QKD, which typically use multimode fibers to reduce coupling loss, it is vitally important to understand how the multimode fiber coupling will impact the total QBER. This work studies the impact of the time-jitter contribution to QBER when coupling a commercial off -the-shelf silicon single-photon avalanche diode with various multimode fibers while simulating operating at 1 GHz with empirical measurements taken at 1 MHz repetition rate. It was found that step-index multimode fibers can significantly increase the QBER, while graded-index fibers can provide an QBER contribution similar to a single-mode fiber. The results highlight that there is a significant benefit in using graded index multimode fibers for a free-space QKD receiver, particularly for high repetition rate applications.

TI Robust Quantum-Assisted Discrete Design of Industrial Smart Energy
   Utility Systems with Long-Term Operational Uncertainties: A Case Study
   of a Food and Cosmetic Industry in Germany
SO ENERGIES
AB The industrial sector is a major contributor to energy-related CO2 emissions in Europe, making the transition to renewable energy solutions essential. Decarbonization strategies integrate renewable energy sources, power-to-heat technologies, and energy storage systems into existing production sites to enhance sustainability and flexibility. However, a key challenge lies in designing energy systems that remain robust under long-term operational uncertainties. Usually the design of each energy system component is discrete, as it is manufactured in a predetermined size. Classical state-of-the-art coupled design and operational optimization methods are based on continuous design variables, which might give sub-optimal solutions. This study overcomes this limitation by employing novel, computationally efficient robust quantum-classical discrete-design methods. Traditional approaches often optimize operations for a single year due to the computational limitations of operational optimization algorithms, leading to designs that lack robustness. By incorporating long-term operational uncertainties, this approach ensures that selected energy-system configurations minimize both CO2 emissions and costs while maintaining resilience to variations in weather conditions and demand fluctuations. Robust discrete designs which consider operational uncertainties show 12% less global warming impact (GWI) with 27% higher total annualized cost (TAC) compared to designs based on operational optimization without uncertainty. A novel quantum-assisted non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm (QANSGA-II) shows accuracy up to 90%, which leads to 27% less computational effort than the NSGA-II algorithm. This novel method can help industries to search larger and more optimal robust discrete-design spaces for making decarbonization decisions.

AB INFN has been running a distributed infrastructure (the Tier-1 at Bologna-CNAF and 9 Tier-2 centres) for more than 20 years which currently offers about 150000 CPU cores and 120 PB of space both in tape and disk storage, serving more than 40 international scientific collaborations. This Grid-based infrastructure was augmented in 2019 with the INFN Cloud: a production quality multi-site federated Cloud infrastructure, composed by a core backbone, and which is able to integrate other INFN sites and public or private Clouds as well. The INFN Cloud provides a customizable and extensible portfolio offering computing and storage services spanning the IaaS, PaaS and SaaS layers, with dedicated solutions to serve special purposes, such as ISO-certified regions for the handling of sensitive data. INFN is now revising and expanding its infrastructure to tackle the challenges expected in the next 10 years of scientific computing adopting a "cloud-first" approach, through which all the INFN data centres will be federated via the INFN Cloud middleware and integrated with key HPC centres, such as the pre-exascale Leonardo machine at CINECA. In such a process, which involves both the infrastructures and the higher level services, initiatives and projects such as the "Italian National Centre on HPC, Big Data and Quantum Computing" (funded in the context of the Italian "National Recovery and Resilience Plan") and the Bologna Technopole are precious opportunities that will be exploited to offer advanced resources and services to universities, research institutions and industry. In this paper we describe how INFN is evolving its computing infrastructure, with the ambition to create and operate a national vendorneutral, open, scalable, and flexible "datalake" able to serve much more than just INFN users and experiments.

TI Chiroptical Response Inversion and Enhancement of Room-Temperature
   Exciton-Polaritons Using 2D Chirality in Perovskites
SO ADVANCED MATERIALS
AB Although chiral semiconductors have shown promising progress in direct circularly polarized light (CPL) detection and emission, they still face potential challenges. A chirality-switching mechanism or approach integrating two enantiomers is needed to discriminate the handedness of a given CPL; additionally, a large material volume is required for sufficient chiroptical interaction. These two requirements pose significant obstacles to the simplification and miniaturization of the devices. Here, room-temperature chiral polaritons fulfilling dual-handedness functions and exhibiting a more-than-two-order enhancement of the chiroptical signal are demonstrated, by embedding a 40 nm-thick perovskite film with a 2D chiroptical effect into a Fabry-Perot cavity. By mixing chiral perovskites with different crystal structures, a pronounced 2D chiroptical effect is accomplished in the perovskite film, featured by an inverted chiroptical response for counter-propagating CPL. This inversion behavior matches the photonic handedness switch during CPL circulation in the Fabry-Perot cavity, thus harvesting giant enhancement of the chiroptical response. Furthermore, affected by the unique quarter-wave-plate effects, the polariton emission achieves a chiral dissymmetry of & PLUSMN;4% (for the emission from the front and the back sides). The room-temperature polaritons with the strong dissymmetric chiroptical interaction shall have implications on a fundamental level and future on-chip applications for biomolecule analysis and quantum computing.
   The light-matter interaction between a 2D chiroptical film and a Fabry-Perot cavity is investigated. The chiroptical response inversion of the 2D chiroptical film shall be ideally suited to the circularly polarized light switching feature in the Fabry-Perot cavity, resulting in the enhancement effect in the chiroptical signal.image

TI Lightweight Multifactor Authentication Scheme for NextGen Cellular
   Networks
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB With increased interest in 6G (6th Generation) cellular networks that can support intelligently small-cell communication will result in effective device-to-device (D2D) communication. High throughput requirement in 5G/6G cellular technology requires each device to act as intelligent transmission relays. Inclusion of such intelligence relays and support of quantum computing at D2D may compromise existing security mechanisms and may lead towards primitive attacks such as impersonation attack, rouge device attack, replay attack, MITM attack, and DoS attack. Thus, an effective yet lightweight security scheme is required that can support existing low computation devices and can address the challenges that 5G/6G poses. This paper proposes a Lightweight ECC (elliptic curve cryptography)-based Multifactor Authentication Protocol (LEMAP) for miniaturized mobile devices. LEMAP is the extension of our previous published work TLwS (trust-based lightweight security scheme) which utilizes ECC with Elgamal for achieving lightweight security protocol, confidentiality, integrity, and non-repudiation. Multi-factor Authentication is based on OTP (Biometrics, random number), timestamp, challenge, and password. This scheme has mitigated the above-mentioned attacks with significantly lower computation cost, communication cost, and authentication overhead. We have proven the correctness of the scheme using widely accepted Burrows-Abadi-Needham (BAN) logic and analyzed the performance of the scheme by using a simulator. The security analysis of the scheme has been conducted using the Discrete Logarithm Problem to verify any quantum attack possibility. The proposed scheme works well for 5G/6G cellular networks for single and multihop scenarios.

TI Resolving Jahn-Teller induced vibronic fine structure of silicon vacancy
   quantum emission in silicon carbide
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
AB Point defects in semiconductors are promising single-photon emitters (SPEs) for quantum computing, communication, and sensing applications. However, factors such as emission brightness, purity. and indistinguishability are limited by interactions between localized defect states and the surrounding environment. Therefore, it is important to map the full emission spectrum from each SPE, to understand the complex interplay between the different defect configurations, their surroundings, and external perturbations. Herein, we investigate a family of regularly spaced sharp luminescence peaks appearing in the near-infrared portion of photoluminescence (PL) spectra from n-type 4H-SiC samples after irradiation. This periodic emitter family, labeled the L lines, is only observed when the zero-phonon line signatures of the negatively charged Si vacancy (so-called V lines) are present. The L lines appear with 1.45 meV and 1.59 meV energy spacing after H and He irradiation and increase linearly in intensity with fluence-reminiscent of the intrinsic defect trend. Furthermore, we monitor the dependence of the L-line emission energy and intensity on heat treatments, electric field strength, and PL collection temperature, discussing these data in the context of the L lines. Based on the strong similarity between the irradiation, electric field, and thermal responses of the L and V lines, the L lines are attributed to the Si vacancy in 4H-SiC. The regular and periodic appearance of the L lines provides strong arguments for a vibronic origin explaining the oscillatory multipeak spectrum. To account for the small energy separation of the L lines, we propose a model based on rotations of distortion surrounding the Si vacancy driven by a dynamic Jahn-Teller effect.

TI Transmission of quantum-secured images
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB The secure transmission of an image can be accomplished by encoding the image information, securely communicating this information, and subsequently reconstructing the image. Alternatively, here we show how the image itself can be directly transmitted while ensuring that the presence of any eavesdropper is revealed in a way akin to quantum key distribution (QKD). We achieve this transmission using a photon-pair source with the deliberate addition of a thermal light source as background noise. One photon of the pair illuminates the object, which is masked from an eavesdropper by adding indistinguishable thermal photons, the other photon of the pair acts as a time reference with which the intended recipient can preferentially filter the image carrying photons from the background. These reference photons are themselves made sensitive to the presence of an eavesdropper by traditional polarisation-based QKD encoding. Interestingly the security verification is performed in the two-dimensional polarisation-basis, but the image information is encoded in a much higher-dimensional, hence information-rich, pixel basis. In our example implementation, our image comprises of 152 independent pixels. Beyond the secure transmission of images, our approach to the distribution of secure high-dimensional information may offer new high-bandwidth approaches to QKD.

TI Laser-induced molecular contamination de-risking activity for the Laser
   Interferometer Space Antenna
SO APPLIED OPTICS
AB The Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) will be the first space-based gravitational wave observatory. LISA uses continuous-wave, infrared laser beams propagating among three widely separated spacecrafts to measure their distances with picometer accuracy via time-delay interferometry. These measurements put very high demands on the laser wavefront and are thus very sensitive to any deposits on laser optics that could be induced by laser-induced molecular contamination (LIMC). In this work, we describe the results of an extensive experimental test campaign assessing LIMC related risks for LISA. We find that the LIMC concern for LISA, even considering the high demands on the laser wavefront, may be greatly reduced compared to that observed at shorter wavelengths or with pulsed laser radiation. This result is very promising for LISA as well as for other space missions using continuous-wave, infrared laser radiation, e.g., in free space laser communication or quantum key distribution.Published by Optica Publishing Group under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 License.

TI Two-Mode Bosonic State Tomography with Single-Shot Joint-Parity
   Measurement of a Trapped Ion
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB The full characterization of a continuous-variable quantum system is a challenging problem. For the trapped-ion system, a number of methods of measuring the quantum states have been developed, including the measurement of the Q quasiprobability function and the density-matrix elements in the Fock basis, but these approaches are often slow and difficult to scale to multimode states. Here, we demonstrate a novel and powerful scheme for measuring a continuous-variable quantum state that uses the direct single-shot measurement of the joint parity of the phonon states of a trapped ion. We drive a spin-dependent bichromatic beam-splitter interaction that coherently exchanges phonons between different harmonic oscillator modes of the ion. This interaction encodes the joint-parity information into the relative phase between the two spin states, enabling measurement of the combined phonon-number parity across multiple modes in a single shot. Leveraging this capability, we directly measure multimode Wigner quasiprobability distributions to perform quantum state tomography of an entangled coherent state, and calculate various quantum informational quantities with a model-based estimation of the density matrix. We further show that the single-shot joint-parity measurement can be used to detect parity-flip errors in real time. By postselecting the parity-measurement outcomes, we experimentally demonstrate the partial recovery of coherence, effectively implementing an error-mitigation technique. Lastly, we identify the various sources of error affecting the fidelity of the spin-dependent beam-splitter operation and study the feasibility of high-fidelity operations. The interaction studied in this work can be extended to more than two modes, and is highly relevant to continuous-variable quantum computing and quantum metrology.

TI Optimizing effective anisotropy in magnetic tunnel junctions for
   operation at cryogenic temperatures
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW APPLIED
AB The development of working cryogenic memories is very important for the scalability and feasibility of quantum computing. In this context, FeCoB/MgO-based spin-transfer-torque magnetic random-access memories emerge as promising candidates to address this challenge. At low temperatures, the reduction in thermal noise allows for a lower energy barrier while retaining sufficient memory performance. Since the effective anisotropy of the system is directly proportional to the energy barrier, understanding how it varies with material parameters and temperature is crucial. In this work, we present an experimental method for extrapolating the thin-film magnetic properties measured at room temperature to the electrical properties of nanofabricated devices at various targeted temperatures. We employ magneto-optical Kerreffect (MOKE) magnetometry to calculate the effective anisotropy energy density across the entire 100mm wafer surface at room temperature. This method is entirely adapted to probe wafers of various sizes, and it is found to be faster and equivalent to conventional methods, such as vibrating sample magnetometry and superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID) magnetometry. The temperature evolution of magnetic anisotropy is further investigated using SQUID magnetometry from 300 to 10 K. Finally, the critical switching voltage from 300 to 40 K is measured for various nanofabricated devices with different FeCoB storage-layer thicknesses. A model correlating the switching voltage of these devices with the effective anisotropy at the thin-film level is used to explain their temperature and thickness dependencies. These results confirm the validity of the MOKE method presented in this work and its potential in selecting devices across the wafer to function at a given operational target temperature.

TI Single-molecule Magnets (SMM) spin channels connecting FeMn
   antiferromagnet and NiFe ferromagnetic electrodes of a tunnel junction
SO JOURNAL OF MAGNETISM AND MAGNETIC MATERIALS
AB The integration of single-molecule magnets (SMMs) into magnetic tunnel junctions (MTJs) offers significant potential for advancing molecular spintronics, particularly for next-generation memory devices, quantum computing, and energy storage technologies such as solar cells. In this study, we present the first demonstration of SMM-induced spin-dependent properties in an antiferromagnet-based MTJ molecular spintronic device (MTJMSD). We engineered cross-junction-shaped devices comprising FeMn/AlOx/NiFe MTJs. The AlOx barrier thickness where the exposed junction edges meet was comparable to the SMM length, facilitating the incorporation of SMM molecules as spin channels for spin-dependent transport. The SMM channels enabled long-range magnetic moment ordering around molecular junctions, which were precisely engineered via fabrication processes. The SMM, composed of a[Mn6(mu 3-O)2(H2N-sao)6(6-atha)2(EtOH)6] (H2N-saoH = salicylamidoxime, 6-atha = 6-acetylthiohexanoate) complex, featured thioester groups at the ends that upon hydrolysis they form bonds with the magnetic electrodes. SMMtreated junctions demonstrated a significant current enhancement, reaching up to 7 mu A at an input voltage of 60 mV. Furthermore, SMM-doped junctions exhibited current stabilization in the mu A range at lower temperatures, whereas the bare electrodes showed current suppression to the picoampere range. Magnetization measurements conducted at 55 K and 300 K on pillar-shaped devices revealed a reduction in magnetic moment at low temperatures. Additionally, Kelvin probe atomic force microscopy (KPAFM) measurements confirmed that SMM integration transformed the electronic properties over long ranges.These findings are attributed to the spin channels formed between magnetic metal electrodes, which enhance spin polarization at each magnetic electrode. Our research highlights the potential of using antiferromagnetic materials, characterized by minimal stray fields and zero net magnetization, to transform MTJMSD devices.

AB Rapid single-flux quantum (RSFQ) is one of the most advanced cryogenic superconductive electronics technologies. With orders of magnitude smaller power dissipation, RSFQ is an attractive technology for cloud computing, aerospace electronics, and high-speed interfacing with quantum computing systems. Technological challenges however greatly complicate the realization of VLSI-complexity RSFQ systems. For example, gate-level pipelining in SFQ systems incurs a significant area overhead due to the need for path balancing. This issue is particularly detrimental to SFQ systems due to the limited layout density of RSFQ systems. Multiple advanced SFQ logic cells exist that can be efficiently realized using SFQ technology. For example, a T1-cell can realize the full adder function with only half the area required by the conventional realization. This cell however imposes complex constraints on input signal timing, complicating its use. Multiphase clocking, recently proposed to reduce the path balancing overhead, is an effective tool for controlling the timing of the signals within a network. By utilizing multiphase clocking, the timing of the input signals of the T1-cells can be efficiently satisfied, enabling its use within the SFQ networks. In this paper, we propose a two-stage SFQ technology mapping methodology supporting the T1-cells. During the logic synthesis stage, specific parts of the SFQ network are replaced by efficient T1-cells. During the retiming stage, phases are assigned to each logic gate within the network and DFFs are inserted to satisfy the timing constraints. Using our method, the area of the SFQ networks is reduced, on average, by 6% with up to 25% reduction in optimizing the 128-bit adder.

TI Analog programming of CMOS-compatible
   Al2O3/TiO2-x memristor at 4.2K after
   metal-insulator transition suppression by cryogenic reforming
SO APPLIED PHYSICS LETTERS
AB Exploration of memristors' behavior at cryogenic temperatures has become crucial due to the growing interest in quantum computing and cryogenic electronics. In this context, our study focuses on the characterization at cryogenic temperatures (4.2K) of TiO2-x-based memristors fabricated with a CMOS-compatible etch-back process. We demonstrate a so-called cryogenic reforming (CR) technique performed at 4.2K to overcome the well-known metal-insulator transition (MIT), which limits the analog behavior of memristors at low temperatures. This cryogenic reforming process was found to be reproducible and led to a durable suppression of the MIT. This process allowed to reduce by similar to 20% the voltages required to perform DC resistive switching at 4.2K. Additionally, conduction mechanism studies of memristors before and after cryogenic reforming from 4.2 to 300K revealed different behaviors above 100K, indicating a potential change in the conductive filament stoichiometry. The reformed devices exhibit a conductance level that is 50 times higher than ambient-formed memristor, and the conduction drop between 300 and 4.2K is 100 times smaller, indicating the effectiveness of the reforming process. More importantly, CR enables analog programming at 4.2K with typical read voltages allowing to store up to 4bits of information on a single CR memristor. Suppressing the MIT improved the analog switching dynamics of the memristor leading to similar to 250% larger on/off ratios during long-term depression (LTD)/long-term potentiation (LTP) resistance tuning. This enhancement opens up the possibility of using TiO2-x-based memristors to be used as synapses in neuromorphic computing at cryogenic temperatures.

TI Futuristic view of the Internet of Quantum Drones: Review, challenges
   and research agenda
SO VEHICULAR COMMUNICATIONS
AB The disruptive technology of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), or drones, is a trend with increasing applications and practical relevance in the current and future society. Despite the common interest in drones for commercial deliveries, the use of this disruptive technology can be examined in the contexts of other world strategic demands such as climate change issues and traffic management. As of very recently, some drone-related futuristic disruptive technologies, including quantum drones (QD), the Internet of Quantum Drones (IoQDs), and a constellation of quantum satellites (CQS), are expected to be a breakthrough technology in strategic areas of society. However, prior research has not adequately examined and explored the potential applications of these drone-related futuristic disruptive technologies for social concern. Therefore, this study investigates how QD, IoQDs, and CQS can be applied in new contexts in real-time applications in strategic areas of societal interest, especially during the quantum age. Overall, our results unveil new potential and advanced applications to drone-related disruptive technologies in recognized and new contexts. Two relevant implications are highlighted. First, this research inaugurates new contexts regarding the use of drone-related technologies enabled by the Internet in themes of economic and social concerns. Second, from a futuristic point of view, the study examines the main challenges, risks, and advantages of the practical use of these technologies. We conclude this research with a summary of the main gaps and scientific challenges to the field and propose opportunities for future research. (C) 2022 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Inc.

TI A Davydov Ansatz approach to accurate system-bath dynamics in the
   presence of multiple baths with distinct temperatures
SO JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL PHYSICS
AB We perform benchmark simulations using the time-dependent variational approach with the multiple Davydov Ansatz (mDA) to study real-time nonequilibrium dynamics in a single qubit model coupled to two thermal baths with distinct temperatures. A broad region of the parameter space has been investigated, accompanied by a detailed analysis of the convergence behavior of the mDA method. In addition, we have compared our mD2 results to those from two widely adopted, numerically "exact" techniques: the methods of hierarchical equations of motion (HEOM) and the quasi-adiabatic path integral (QUAPI). It is found that the mDA approach in combination with thermal field dynamics yields numerically accurate, convergent results in nearly all regions of the parameter space examined, including those that pose serious challenges for QUAPI and HEOM. Our results reveal that mDA offers a highly adaptable framework capable of capturing long-time dynamics, even in challenging regimes where other methods face limitations. These findings underscore the potential of mDA as a versatile tool for exploring quantum thermodynamics, energy transfer processes, and non-equilibrium quantum systems.

TI A cryogenic electro-optic interconnect for superconducting devices
SO NATURE ELECTRONICS
AB A major challenge to the scalability of cryogenic computing platforms is the heat load associated with the growing number of electrical cable connections between the superconducting circuitry and the room-temperature environment. Compared with electrical cables, optical fibres have significantly lower thermal conductivity and are widely used in modern telecommunications. However, optical modulation at cryogenic temperatures remains relatively unexplored. Here we report the cryogenic electro-optical readout of a superconducting electromechanical circuit using a commercial titanium-doped lithium niobate modulator. We demonstrate coherent spectroscopy by measuring optomechanically induced transparency and incoherent thermometry by encoding the mechanical sidebands in an optical signal. We also show that our modulators can maintain their room-temperature Pockels coefficient at 800 mK. Further optimization of the modulator design-for example, by using longer waveguides and materials with a higher Pockels coefficient-could reduce the added noise of our setup to similar levels as current semiconductor microwave amplifiers.
   A commercial titanium-doped lithium niobate phase modulator can be employed at temperatures as low as 800 mK for the electro-optical readout of a superconducting electromechanical circuit at 15 mK.

TI Predicted strong coupling of solid-state spins via a single magnon mode
SO MATERIALS FOR QUANTUM TECHNOLOGY
AB We propose an approach to realize a hybrid quantum system composed of a diamond nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center spin coupled to a magnon mode of the low-damping, low-moment organic ferrimagnet vanadium tetracyanoethylene. We derive an analytical expression for the spin-magnon cooperativity as a function of NV position under a micron-scale perpendicularly magnetized disk, and show that, surprisingly, the cooperativity will be higher using this magnetic material than in more conventional materials with larger magnetic moments, due to in part to the reduced demagnetization field. For reasonable experimental parameters, we predict that the spin-magnon-mode coupling strength is g similar to 2 pi x 10 kHz. For isotopically pure C-12 diamond we predict strong coupling of an NV spin to the unoccupied magnon mode, with cooperativity C-lambda = 15 for a wide range of NV spin locations within the diamond, well within the spatial precision of NV center implantation. Thus our proposal describes a practical pathway for single-spin-state-to-single-magnon-occupancy transduction and for entangling NV centers over micron length scales.

TI The multi-photon induced Fano effect
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB The ordinary Fano effect occurs in many-electron atoms and requires an autoionizing state. With such a state, photo-ionization may proceed via pathways that interfere, and the characteristic asymmetric resonance structures appear in the continuum. Here we demonstrate that Fano structure may also be induced without need of auto-ionization, by dressing the continuum with an ordinary bound state in any atom by a coupling laser. Using multi-photon processes gives complete, ultra-fast control over the interference. We show that a line-shape index q near unity (maximum asymmetry) may be produced in hydrogenic silicon donors with a relatively weak beam. Since the Fano lineshape has both constructive and destructive interference, the laser control opens the possibility of state-selective detection with enhancement on one side of resonance and invisibility on the other. We discuss a variety of atomic and molecular spectroscopies, and in the case of silicon donors we provide a calculation for a qubit readout application. Fano resonances occur in many platforms that have auto-ionizing states. Here the authors show that auto-ionizing states are not required for multi-photon Fano resonance in a Si:P system with significant screening by using a pump-probe method.

TI Clifford-Deformed Surface Codes
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB Various realizations of Kitaev's surface code perform surprisingly well for biased Pauli noise. Attracted by these potential gains, we study the performance of Clifford -deformed surface codes (CDSCs) obtained from the surface code by the application of single-qubit Clifford operators. We first analyze CDSCs on the 3 x 3 square lattice and find that, depending on the noise bias, their logical error rates can differ by orders of magnitude. To explain the observed behavior, we introduce the effective distance d', which reduces to the standard distance for unbiased noise. To study CDSC performance in the thermodynamic limit, we focus on random CDSCs. Using the statistical mechanical mapping for quantum codes, we uncover a phase diagram that describes random CDSC families with 50% threshold at infinite bias. In the high -threshold region, we further demonstrate that typical code realizations outperform the thresholds and subthreshold logical error rates, at finite bias, of the best-known translationally invariant codes. We demonstrate the practical relevance of these random CDSC families by constructing a translation -invariant CDSC belonging to a high-performance random CDSC family. We also show that our translation -invariant CDSC outperforms well-known translation -invariant CDSCs, such as the XZZX and XY codes.

TI Mixed-Sandwich Titanium(III) Qubits on Au(111): Electron Delocalization
   Ruled by Molecular Packing
SO NANO LETTERS
AB Organometallic sandwich complexes are versatile molecular systems that have been recently employed for single-molecule manipulation and spin sensing experiments. Among related organometallic compounds, the mixed-sandwich S = 1/2 complex (eta(8)-cyclooctatetraene)(eta(5)-cyclopentadienyl)titanium, here [CpTi(cot)], has attracted interest as a spin qubit because of the long coherence time. Here the structural and chemical properties of [CpTi(cot)] on Au(111) are investigated at the monolayer level by experimental and computational methods. Scanning tunneling microscopy suggests that adsorption occurs in two molecular orientations, lying and standing, with a 3:1 ratio. XPS data evidence that a fraction of the molecules undergo partial electron transfer to gold, while our computational analysis suggests that only the standing molecules experience charge delocalization toward the surface. Such a phenomenon depends on intermolecular interactions that stabilize the molecular packing in the monolayer. This orientation dependent molecule-surface hybridization opens exciting perspectives for selective control of the molecule-substrate spin delocalization in hybrid interfaces.

TI Experimental characterization of the quantum many-body localization
   transition
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB As strength of disorder enhances beyond a threshold value in many-body systems, a fundamental transformation happens through which the entire spectrum localizes, a phenomenon known as many-body localization. This has profound implications as it breaks down fundamental principles of statistical mechanics, such as thermalization and ergodicity. Due to the complexity of the problem, the investigation of the many-body localization transition has remained a big challenge. The experimental exploration of the transition point is even more challenging as most of the proposed quantities for studying such an effect are practically infeasible. Here, we experimentally implement a scalable protocol for detecting the many-body localization transition point, using the dynamics of an N = 12 superconducting qubit array. We show that the sensitivity of the dynamics to random samples becomes maximum at the transition point, which leaves its fingerprints in all spatial scales. By exploiting three quantities, each with a different spatial resolution, we identify the transition point with an excellent match between simulation and experiment. In addition, one can detect the evidence of a mobility edge through slight variation of the transition point as the initial state varies. The protocol is easily scalable and can be performed across various physical platforms.

TI Optimal Conversion from Classical to Quantum Randomness via Quantum
   Chaos
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB Quantum many-body systems provide a unique platform for exploring the rich interplay between chaos, randomness, and complexity. In a recently proposed paradigm known as deep thermalization, random quantum states of system A are generated by performing projective measurements on system B following chaotic Hamiltonian evolution acting jointly on AB. In this scheme, the randomness of the projected state ensemble arises from the intrinsic randomness of the outcomes when B is measured. Here, we propose a modified scheme in which classical randomness injected during the protocol is converted by quantum chaos into quantum randomness of the resulting state ensemble. We show that for generic chaotic systems this conversion is optimal in that each bit of injected classical entropy generates as much additional quantum randomness as adding an extra qubit to B. This significantly enhances the randomness of the projected ensemble without imposing additional demands on the quantum hardware. Our scheme can be easily implemented on typical analog quantum simulators, providing a more scalable route for generating quantum randomness valuable for many applications. In particular, we demonstrate that the accuracy of a shadow tomography protocol can be substantially improved.

TI Correlating aluminum layer deposition rates, Josephson junction
   microstructure, and superconducting qubits' performance
SO ACTA MATERIALIA
AB An ultra-thin aluminum oxide layer is a key component for Josephson junctions (JJ) in superconducting quantum bits (qubits). This layer serves as a barrier layer for Cooper pairs tunneling between the superconducting electrodes and significantly influences the overall performance of the junction. In this study, we investigate the impact of aluminum deposition rates on the microstructure and chemical variation of the aluminum oxide layer, as well as the device's yields and qubits' lifetimes. Surprisingly, although the oxide layer roughness and thickness variation improve noticeably with an increasing Al deposition rate from 0.5 & Aring;/s to 5 & Aring;/s, the qubit's coherence time is almost unchanged. We attribute this to the fact that Cooper pairs tunnel only through the thinnest region of the barrier. Additionally, we revealed a stress-induced grain boundary sliding short-circuit failure mechanism in the JJ. Our discovery provides a vital understanding of oxide microstructure and JJ functionality, which are critical for improving the coherence time of superconducting qubits.

TI A Theory of Inaccessible Information
SO QUANTUM
AB What would be the consequences if there were fundamental limits to our ability to experimentally explore the world? In this work we seriously consider this question. We start by assuming the existence of statements whose truth value is not experimentally accessible. That is, there is no way, not even in theory, to directly test if these statements are true or false. We further develop a theory in which experimentally accessible statements are a union of a fixed minimum number of inaccessible statements. For example, the value of truth of the statements a and b is not accessible, but the value of truth of the statement "a or b" is accessible. We do not directly assume probability theory, we exclusively define experimentally accessible and inaccessible statements and build on these notions using the rules of classical logic. We find that an interesting structure emerges. Developing this theory, we relax the logical structure, naturally obtaining a derivation of a constrained quasi- probabilistic theory rich in structure that we name theory of inaccessible information. Surprisingly, the simplest model of theory of inaccessible information is the qubit in quantum mechanics. Along the path for the construction of this theory, we characterise and study a family of multiplicative information measures that we call inaccessibility measures.

TI In situ tuning of optomechanical crystals with
   nano-oxidation
SO OPTICA
AB Optomechanical crystals are a promising device platform for quantum transduction and sensing. Precise targeting of the optical and acoustic resonance frequencies of these devices is crucial for future advances on these fronts. However, fabrication disorder in these wavelength-scale nanoscale devices typically leads to inhomogeneous resonance frequencies. Here we achieve in situ, selective frequency tuning of optical and acoustic resonances in silicon optomechanical crystals via electric field-induced nano-oxidation using an atomic-force microscope. Our method can achieve a tuning range >2 nm (0.13%) for the optical resonance wavelength in the telecom C -band, and >60 MHz (1.2%) for the acoustic resonance frequency at 5 GHz. The tuning resolution of 1.1 pm for the optical wavelength and 150 kHz for the acoustic frequency allows us to spectrally align multiple optomechanical crystal resonators using a pattern generation algorithm. Our results establish a method for precise post-fabrication tuning of optomechanical crystals. This technique can enable coupled optomechanical resonator arrays, scalable resonant optomechanical circuits, and frequency matching of microwave-optical quantum transducers.

TI Multi-Port Memory Design in Quantum Cellular Automata Using Logical
   Crossing
SO INFORMACIJE MIDEM-JOURNAL OF MICROELECTRONICS ELECTRONIC COMPONENTS AND
   MATERIALS
AB Memory and its data communication play a vital role in deciding the performance of a Processor. In order to obtain a high performance computing machine, memory access has to be equally faster. In this paper, Dual port memory with Set/Reset is designed using Majority Voter in Quantum-dot Cellular Automata (QCA). Dual port memory consists of basic functional blocks such as 2 to 4 decoder, Control Logic Block (CLB), Address Checker Block (ACB), Memory Cell (MC), Data Router block and Input/Output block. These functional units are constructed using the 3 input majority voters. QCA is one of the recent technologies for the design of nanometer level digital components. The functionality of Dual Port Memory has been simulated and verified in QCADesigner 2.0.3. A novel crossover method called Logical Crossing is utilized to improve the area of the proposed design. The logical crossing does the data transmission with the support of proper Clock zone assignment. the logical crossing based QCA layouts are optimized in terms of area and number of cell counts. It is observed that 29.81%, 18.27%, 8.32%, 11.57% and 3.69% are the percentage of improvement in the number of cells in Decoder, ACB, CLB, Data Router and Memory Cell respectively. Also, 25.7196, 16.83%, 8.62%, 4.74% and 3.73% of improvement is achieved in the area for Decoder, ACB, CI B, Data Router and Memory Cell respectively. In addition to that the proposed Dual port memory using logical crossing attains improvement in the area by 8.26%; that is made possible due to the 8.65% reduction in the number of cells required for its construction. Moreover, the quantum circuits of the RAM are obtained using the RCViewer+ tool. The quantum cost constant inputs, the number of gates, garbage output and total cost are estimated as 285, 67, 57, 50 and 516 respectively.

Quantum supremacy experiments have been a major step forward, but gaps remain between the theory behind these experiments and their actual implementations. In this work we initiate the study of the complexity of quantum random circuit sampling experiments with realistic amounts of noise.
   Actual quantum supremacy experiments have high levels of uncorrected noise and exponentially decaying fidelities. It is natural to ask if there is any signal of exponential complexity in these highly noisy devices. Surprisingly, we show that it remains hard to compute the output probabilities of noisy random quantum circuits without error correction. More formally, so long as the noise rate of the device is below the error detection threshold, we show it is #P-hard to compute the output probabilities of random circuits with a constant rate of noise per gate. This hardness persists even though these probabilities are exponentially close to uniform. Therefore the small deviations away from uniformity are hard to compute, formalizing an important intuition behind Google's supremacy claim.
   Interestingly these hardness results also have implications for the complexity of experiments in a low-noise setting. The issue here is that prior hardness results for computing output probabilities of random circuits are not robust enough to imprecision to connect with the Stockmeyer argument for hardness of sampling from circuits with constant fidelity. We exponentially improve the robustness of prior results to imprecision, both in the cases of Random Circuit Sampling and BosonSampling. In the latter case we bring the proven hardness within a constant factor in the exponent of the robustness required for hardness of sampling for the first time. We then show that our results are in tension with one another - the high-noise result implies the low-noise result is essentially optimal, even with generalizations of our techniques.

TI The rise of stochasticity in physics
SO EUROPEAN PHYSICAL JOURNAL PLUS
AB In the last 175 years, the physical understanding of nature has seen a revolutionary change. Until about 1850, Newton's theory and the mechanical world view derived from it provided the dominant view of the physical world, later supplemented by Maxwell's theory of the electromagnetic field. That approach was entirely deterministic and free of probabilistic concepts. In contrast to that conceptual edifice, today many fields of physics are governed by probabilistic concepts. Statistical mechanics in its classical or quantum version and random-matrix theory are obvious examples. Quantum mechanics is an intrinsically statistical theory. Classical chaos and its quantum manifestations also require a stochastic approach. The paper describes how a combination of discoveries and conceptual problems undermined the mechanical world view, led to novel concepts, and shaped the modern understanding of physics. As essential causes, I list Clausius' formulation of the second law of thermodynamics, the very large number of molecules in a macroscopic gas container which caused Maxwell to formulate his statistical kinetic theory, Boltzmann's statistical approach which attempted to reconcile irreversibility as manifest in the second law of thermodynamics with Newtonian mechanics, the discovery of radioactivity and of discrete spectral lines in the emission of light from stars and atoms that could not be understood in classical terms, Poincare's discovery of unstable orbits in the astronomical three-body problem, and black-body radiation that led Planck to the discovery of the quantum of action. A further cause was the need to compensate for incomplete knowledge. Wigner introduced random-matrix theory because the nuclear Hamiltonian was largely unknown. That theory now governs the statistical theory of nuclear reactions. It has spread to many fields of physics, from the theory of electron transport through mesoscopic samples to quantum chromodynamics, to Andreev scattering, to the SYK model used in astrophysics and condensed-matter theory, to two-dimensional gravity, to random quantum circuits, and even to number theory.

TI Nanometer-thick molecular beam epitaxy Al films capped with in
   situ deposited Al2O3-High-crystallinity,
   morphology, and superconductivity
SO JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYSICS
AB Achieving high material perfection in aluminum (Al) films and their associated Al/AlOx heterostructures is essential for enhancing the coherence time in superconducting quantum circuits. We grew Al films with thicknesses ranging from 3 to 30 nanometers (nm) epitaxially on sapphire substrates using molecular beam epitaxy (MBE). An integral aspect of our work involved electron-beam (e-beam) evaporation to directly deposit aluminum oxide (Al2O3) films on the freshly grown ultrathin epitaxial Al films in an ultra-high-vacuum (UHV) environment. This in situ oxide deposition is critical for preventing the oxidation of parts of the Al films, avoiding the formation of undesired native oxides, and thereby preserving the nm-thick Al films in their pristine conditions. The thicknesses of our Al films in the study were accurately determined; for example, coherence lengths of 3.0 and 20.2 nm were measured in the nominal 3.0 and 20 nm thick Al films, respectively. These Al films were epitaxially grown on sapphire substrates, showing an orientational relationship, denoted as Al ( 111 ) < 2(1) over bar(1) over bar > parallel to sapphire ( 0001 ) [2(1) over bar(1) over bar 0 ]. The Al/sapphire interface was atomically ordered without any interfacial layers, as confirmed by in situ reflection high-energy electron diffraction (RHEED) and cross-sectional scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM). All sample surfaces exhibited smoothness with a roughness in the range of 0.1-0.2 nm. The Al films are superconducting with critical temperatures ranging from 1.23 to around 2 K, depending on the film thickness. (C) 2024 Author(s).

TI Magneton bistability in quantum dot-double cavity optomechanical
   coupling system
SO ACTA PHYSICA SINICA
AB Magnons, as quasiparticles arising from spin wave excitations in magnetic materials, have demonstrated significant application potential in quantum information technology, spintronics, and microwave engineering in recent years. The cavity magnon optomechanical system, serving as a key platform for investigating magneto-optical interactions, has advanced the exploration of nonlinear dynamical behaviors and the innovative design of quantum devices through strong coupling between magnons, photons, and phonons. However, traditional single-cavity systems face limitations in terms of tunability, long-range interactions, and nonlinear enhancement, making them insufficient for complex quantum control requirements. In recent years, dual-cavity systems have become a research hotspot due to their multidimensional control capabilities achieved through inter-cavity coupling, such as photon mode splitting and enhanced nonlinear Kerr effects. Meanwhile, semiconductor quantum dots, provide a novel pathway for regulating magnon dynamics due to their tunable nonlinear response characteristics. In this work, we construct a novel coupled quantum system by integrating quantum dots and a dual-cavity architecture, and investigate the bistable phenomena under both forward and backward driving field inputs. By comparing the third-order nonlinear equations governing magnon populations in the two scenarios, we derive the impedance matching condition. When this condition is satisfied, the magnon responses induced by forward driving field and backward driving field are identical. Conversely, under impedance mismatch, the magnon responses exhibit different behaviors. Specifically, when the impedance matching condition is violated, the dual-cavity magnon optomechanical system incorporating three-level quantum dot molecules exhibits a lower bistability threshold than its counterpart without quantum dots. This allows for a transition from low steady state to high steady state while reducing the driving field strength, thereby achieving switching functionality at lower input power. Furthermore, we establish a multiparameter cooperative control model, revealing a three-dimensional parameter space formed by tunneling coupling, cavity-quantum dot coupling, and inter-cavity coupling. By adjusting these coupling strengths, the bistability threshold and hysteresis loop width can be effectively controlled, thereby modulating the driving field intensity required for bistability. This system is expected to experimentally observe the magnonic bistability through the vector network analyzer-based detection of abrupt changes in transmission or absorption windows in reflection spectra. Such capabilities can advance data signal transmission, switching devices, and memory technologies, and has the potential to serve as components of large-scale quantum information processing units. Additionally, this research may find important applications in the field of magnetic spintronics.

TI Spin properties in droplet epitaxy grown telecom quantum dots
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
AB We investigate the spin properties of InAs/InGaAs/InP quantum dots grown by metalorganic vapor-phase epitaxy (MOVPE) deposition using droplet epitaxy, which emits in the telecom C band. Using pump-probe Faraday ellipticity measurements, we determine electron and hole g factors of agea = 0.93 and agha = 0.47, with the electron g factor being nearly twice as low as typical molecular beam epitaxy Stranski-Krastanov (SK) grown samples. Most significantly, we measure a longitudinal spin relaxation time T1 = 3.0 mu s, representing an order of magnitude improvement over comparable MBE SK grown samples. Despite significant electron g-factor anisotropy, we observed that it is reduced relative to similar material composition samples grown with MBE or MOVPE SK methods. We attribute this g-factor anisotropy and spin lifetime improvements to the enhanced structural symmetry achieved via MOVPE droplet epitaxy, which mitigates the inherent structural asymmetry in strain-driven growth approaches for InAs/InP quantum dots. These results demonstrate that MOVPE droplet epitaxy-grown InAs/InGaAcompresss/InP quantum dots exhibit favorable spin properties for potential implementation in quantum information applications.

TI Generation and control of high-reflection-efficiency perfect vortex
   beams based on all-dielectric metasurfaces
SO CHINESE OPTICS LETTERS
AB In recent years, the perfect vortex beam with independent wavefront spiral correlation has attracted extensive attention since its beam diameter is independent of topological charge. Perfect vortex beams are expected to make significant progress in optical fiber communications, particle manipulation, quantum information, and other areas. Traditional optical devices are difficult to integrate into the system due to their large size. In this paper, we design and realize a perfect vortex beam with a high reflection efficiency of 90.17% by an all-dielectric metasurface through a Pancharatnam-Berry (PB) phase modulation structure. The cross-polarization conversion efficiency measured by experiment is 89.81%. By modulating the parameter r(0) in the phase function, we can achieve flexible manipulation of topological charges and ring diameters. In addition, we also demonstrate the generation of a four-channel perfect vortex beam array based on the Dammann grating, with a beam uniformity of 40%. Our research will be of great significance for the realization of compact and multifunctional on-chip integrated photonic devices.

TI Time-dependent quantum geometric tensor and some applications
SO PHYSICA SCRIPTA
AB We define a time-dependent extension of the quantum geometric tensor to describe the geometry of the time-parameter space for a quantum state by considering small variations in both time and wave function parameters. Compared to the standard quantum geometric tensor, this tensor introduces new temporal components, enabling the analysis of systems with non-time-separable or explicitly time-dependent quantum states and encoding new information about these systems. In particular, the time-time component of this tensor is related to the energy dispersion of the system. We applied this framework to a harmonic/inverted oscillator, a time-dependent harmonic oscillator, and a chain of generalized harmonic/inverted oscillators. We show some results on the scalar curvature associated with the time-dependent quantum geometric tensor and the generalized Berry curvature behavior on the transition from harmonic oscillators to inverted ones. Furthermore, we analyze the entanglement for the chain through purity analysis, obtaining that the purity for any excited state is zero in the mentioned transitions.

TI High-Extinction Photonic Filters by Cascaded Mach-Zehnder
   Interferometer-Coupled Resonators
SO PHOTONICS
AB In this study, we demonstrate high-extinction stop-band photonic filters based on Mach-Zehnder interferometer (MZI)-coupled silicon nitride (Si3N4) resonators fabricated using I-line lithography technology. Leveraging the low-loss silicon nitride waveguide, our approach enables the creation of stable, high-performance filters suitable for applications in quantum and nonlinear photonics. With destructive interference at the feedback loop, photonic filters with an extinction ratio of 35 dB are demonstrated with four cascaded MZI-coupled resonators. This cascading design not only enhances the filter's extinction but also improves its spectral sharpness, providing a more selective stop-band profile. Experimental results agree well with the theoretical results, showing linear scaling of extinction ratios with the number of cascaded MZI-coupled resonators. The scalability of this architecture opens the possibility for further integration and optimization in complex photonic circuits, where high extinction ratios and precise wavelength selectivity are critical for advanced signal processing and quantum information applications.

TI The chirality-induced spin selectivity effect in asymmetric spin
   transport: from solution to device applications
SO CHEMICAL SCIENCE
AB The chirality-induced spin selectivity (CISS) effect has garnered significant interest in the field of molecular spintronics due to its potential to create spin-polarized electrons without the need for a magnet. Recent studies devoted to CISS effects in various chiral materials demonstrate exciting prospects for spintronics, chiral recognition, and quantum information applications. Several experimental studies have confirmed the applicability of chiral molecules in spin-filtering properties, influencing spin-polarized electron transport and photoemission. Researchers aim to predict CISS phenomena and apply this concept to practical applications by compiling experimental results. To expand the possibilities of spin manipulation and create new opportunities for spin-based technologies, researchers are diligently exploring different chiral organic and inorganic materials for probing the CISS effect. This ongoing research holds promise for developing novel spin-based technologies and advancing the understanding of the intricate relationship between chirality and electron spin. The review highlights the remarkable experimental and theoretical frameworks related to the CISS effect, its impact on spintronics, and its relevance in other scientific areas.

TI Gauge-Invariant Quantum Thermodynamics: Consequences for the First Law
SO ENTROPY
AB The universality of classical thermodynamics rests on the central limit theorem, due to which, measurements of thermal fluctuations are unable to reveal detailed information regarding the microscopic structure of a macroscopic body. When small systems are considered and fluctuations become important, thermodynamic quantities can be understood in the context of classical stochastic mechanics. A fundamental assumption behind thermodynamics is therefore that of coarse graining, which stems from a substantial lack of control over all degrees of freedom. However, when quantum systems are concerned, one claims a high level of control. As a consequence, information theory plays a major role in the identification of thermodynamic functions. Here, drawing from the concept of gauge symmetry-essential in all modern physical theories-we put forward a new possible intermediate route. Working within the realm of quantum thermodynamics, we explicitly construct physically motivated gauge transformations which encode a gentle variant of coarse graining behind thermodynamics. As a first application of this new framework, we reinterpret quantum work and heat, as well as the role of quantum coherence.

TI Time alignment quantum illumination based on single real-time
   coincidence counting
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB We propose and demonstrate an improved quantum illumination protocol based on the time correlation of twin photons, for the high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of target detection and signal reconstruction in the strong noise environment. The Hong-Ou-Mandel (HOM) interferometer is applied after the spontaneous parametric down-conversion (SPDC) process to construct a probing twin-beam in which the photon times are precisely aligned between the beams. At the radar receiver, we put forward a single real-time coincidence counting (SRCC) method on a series of time slices to reconstruct the probe signals of pulse radar and calculate the SNR advantages against the conventional pulse radar, as well as the quantum illumination (QI) protocol. Our main achievements in this research are the realization of real-time detection of quantum information while acquiring a higher SNR than QI and classical illumination (CI) protocols, as well as its demonstration of strong robustness to noise and losses, which also proposes what we believe to be a novel way for quantum target detection.

TI Topological metasurface: from passive toward active and beyond
SO PHOTONICS RESEARCH
AB Metasurfaces are subwavelength structured thin films consisting of arrays of units that allow the control of polarization, phase, and amplitude of light over a subwavelength thickness. Recent developments in topological photonics have greatly broadened the horizon in designing metasurfaces for novel functional applications. In this review, we summarize recent progress in the research field of topological metasurfaces, first from the perspectives of passive and active in the classical regime, and then in the quantum regime. More specifically, we begin by examining the passive topological phenomena in two-dimensional photonic systems, including both time-reversal broken systems and time-reversal preserved systems. Subsequently, we discuss the cutting-edge studies of active topological metasurfaces, including nonlinear topological metasurfaces and reconfigurable topological metasurfaces. After overviewing topological metasurfaces in the classical regime, we show how they could provide a new platform for quantum information and quantum many-body physics. Finally, we conclude and describe some challenges and future directions of this fast-evolving field. (c) 2023 Chinese Laser Press

TI Oscillating bound states in non-Markovian photonic lattices
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB It is known that the superposition of two bound states in the continuum (BICs) leads to the phenomenon of an oscillating bound state, where excitations mediated by the continuum modes oscillate persistently. We perform exact calculations for the oscillating BICs in a one-dimensional photonic lattice coupled to a "giant atom" at multiple points. Our work is significantly distinct from previous proposals of oscillating BICs in continuous waveguide systems due to the presence of a finite energy band contributing band-edge effects. In particular, we show that the bound states outside the energy band are detrimental to the oscillating BIC phenomenon, and can be suppressed by increasing either the number of coupling points or the separation between each coupling point. Crucially, non-Markovianity is necessary for the existence of oscillating BICs, and the oscillation amplitude increases with the characteristic delay time of the giant atom interactions. We also propose an initialization scheme in the BIC subspace. Our work be experimentally implemented on current photonic waveguide array platforms and opens up prospects in utilizing reservoir engineering for the storage of quantum information in photonic lattices.

TI Calibrated Two-Port Microwave Measurement up to 26.5 GHz for Wide

SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INSTRUMENTATION AND MEASUREMENT
AB To realize a quantum information processing system, it is necessary not only to increase the number of physical qubits but also to cooperatively operate a multitude of cryogenic microwave components, such as cables, circulators, and amplifiers for controlling or reading them. Therefore, it is essential to develop metrological methods to precisely evaluate the microwave scattering parameters of each component at low temperatures. Here, we report a calibrated microwave measurement method for a wide temperature range of 4-300 K. At each temperature, we performed a full two-port calibration, which enables us to precisely measure the scattering parameters of various cryogenic microwave components up to 26.5 GHz by using 3.5-mm connectors as the reference planes. We carefully verified the validity of the calibration impedance elements and demonstrated our method by evaluating the temperature-dependent characteristics of a coaxial cable and a circulator.

TI Creating Quantum Emitters in Hexagonal Boron Nitride Deterministically
   on Chip-Compatible Substrates
SO NANO LETTERS
AB Two-dimensional hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) that hosts room-temperature single-photon emitters (SPEs) is promising for quantum information applications. An important step toward the practical application of hBN is the on-demand, position-controlled generation of SPEs. Strategies reported for deterministic creation of hBN SPEs either rely on substrate nanopatterning that is not compatible with integrated photonics or utilize radiation sources that might introduce unpredictable damage or contamination to hBN. Here, we report a radiation-and lithography-free route to deterministically activate hBN SPEs by nanoindentation with atomic force microscopy (AFM). The method applies to hBN flakes on flat silicon dioxide-silicon substrates that can be readily integrated into on-chip photonic devices. The achieved SPE yields are above 30% for multiple indent sizes, and a maximum yield of 36% is demonstrated for indents around 400 nm. Our results mark an important step toward the deterministic creation and integration of hBN SPEs with photonic and plasmonic devices.

TI Min-entropy as a resource for one-shot private state transfer, quantum
   masking, and state transition
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB We give an operational meaning to the min-entropy of a quantum state as a resource measure for various interconnected tasks. In particular, we show that the min-entropy without smoothing measures the amount of quantum information that can be hidden or encoded perfectly in the one-shot setting when the quantum state is used as a randomness or correlation source. First, we show that the min-entropy of entanglement of a pure bipartite state is the maximum number of qubits privately transferable when the state is used as a quantum one-time pad. Then, through the equivalence of quantum secret sharing-like protocols, it is also shown that the min-entropy of a quantum state is the maximum number of qubits that can be masked when the state is used as a randomness source for a quantum masking process. Consequently, we show that the min-entropy of a quantum state is half the size of the quantum state it can catalytically dephase. This gives a necessary and sufficient condition for catalysts for state transition processes.

TI Revisiting algebraic attacks on MinRank and on the rank decoding problem
SO DESIGNS CODES AND CRYPTOGRAPHY
AB The Rank Decoding problem (RD) is at the core of rank-based cryptography. Cryptosystems such as ROLLO and RQC, which made it to the second round of the NIST Post-Quantum Standardization Process, as well as the Durandal signature scheme, rely on it or its variants. This problem can also be seen as a structured version of MinRank, which is ubiquitous in multivariate cryptography. Recently, Bardet et al. (in: Canteaut and Ishai, Advances in cryptology-EUROCRYPT 2020, Springer, Cham, 2020; Advances in cryptologyASIACRYPT 2020, international conference on the theory and application of cryptology and information security, 2020. Proceedings, 2020) proposed attacks based on two new algebraic modelings, namely the MaxMinorsmodelingwhich is specific toRDand the Support-Minors modeling which applies to MinRank in general. Both improved significantly the complexity of algebraic attacks on these two problems. In the case of RD and contrarily to what was believed up to now, these new attacks were shown to be able to outperform combinatorial attacks and this even for very small field sizes. However, we prove here that the analysis performed in Bardet et al. (in: Advances in cryptology-ASIACRYPT 2020, international conference on the theory and application of cryptology and information security, 2020. Proceedings, 2020) for one of these attacks which consists in mixing the MaxMinors modeling with the Support-Minors modeling to solve RD is too optimistic and leads to underestimate the overall complexity. This is done by exhibiting linear dependencies between these equations and by considering an Fqm version of these modelings which turns out to be instrumental for getting a better understanding of both systems. Moreover, by working over F-q(m) rather than over F-q, we are able to drastically reduce the number of variables in the system and we (i) still keep enough algebraic equations to be able to solve the system, (ii) are able to analyze rigorously the complexity of our approach. This new approach may improve the older MaxMinors approach on RD from Bardet et al. (in: Canteaut and Ishai, Advances in cryptology-EUROCRYPT 2020, Springer, Cham, 2020; Advances in cryptology-ASIACRYPT 2020, international conference on the theory and application of cryptology and information security, 2020. Proceedings, 2020) for certain parameters. We also introduce a new hybrid approach on the Support-Minors system whose impact is much more general since it applies to any MinRank problem. This technique improves significantly the complexity of the Support-Minors approach for small to moderate field sizes.

TI PHOENIX-Paderborn highly optimized and energy efficient solver for
   two-dimensional nonlinear Schrödinger equations with integrated
   extensions
SO COMPUTER PHYSICS COMMUNICATIONS
AB In this work, we introduce PHOENIX, a highly optimized explicit open-source solver for two-dimensional nonlinear Schr & ouml;dinger equations with extensions. The nonlinear Schr & ouml;dinger equation and its extensions (Gross-Pitaevskii equation) are widely studied to model and analyze complex phenomena in fields such as optics, condensed matter physics, fluid dynamics, and plasma physics. It serves as a powerful tool for understanding nonlinear wave dynamics, soliton formation, and the interplay between nonlinearity, dispersion, and diffraction. By extending the nonlinear Schr & ouml;dinger equation, various physical effects such as non-Hermiticity, spin-orbit interaction, and quantum optical aspects can be incorporated. PHOENIX is designed to accommodate a wide range of applications by a straightforward extendability without the need for user knowledge of computing architectures or performance optimization. The high performance and power efficiency of PHOENIX are demonstrated on a wide range of entry-class to high-end consumer and high-performance computing GPUs and CPUs. Compared to a more conventional MATLAB implementation, a speedup of up to three orders of magnitude and energy savings of up to 99.8% are achieved. The performance is compared to a performance model showing that PHOENIX performs close to the relevant performance bounds in many situations. The possibilities of PHOENIX are demonstrated with a range of practical examples from the realm of nonlinear (quantum) photonics in planar microresonators with active media including exciton-polariton condensates. Examples range from solutions on very large grids, the use of local optimization algorithms, to Monte Carlo ensemble evolutions with quantum noise enabling the tomography of the system's quantum state. Program summary Program Title: PHOENIX CPC Library link to program files: https://doi.org/10.17632/kthy8wj3n5.1 Developer's repository link: https://github.com/Schumacher-Group-UPB/PHOENIX/ Licensing provision: MIT Programming language: C++, CUDA Nature of problem: Time evolution of two-dimensional nonlinear systems such as Bose-Einstein condensates, nonlinear optical systems or hybrid light-matter systems (e.g., exciton-polariton condensates).

The use of CPU and GPU and the precision used (fp32/fp64) can be set when compiling the code. Sub-grid decomposition is possible for optimal cache efficiency. The solver provides a framework that allows users unfamiliar with the details of GPU and CPU parallelization to extend the set of equations with additional terms.

TI Superconducting flip-chip devices using indium microspheres on
   Au-passivated Nb or NbN as under-bump metallization layer
SO APPLIED PHYSICS LETTERS
AB Superconducting flip-chip interconnects are crucial for the three-dimensional integration of superconducting circuits in sensing and quantum technology applications. We demonstrate a simplified approach for a superconducting flip-chip device using commercially available indium microspheres and an in-house-built transfer stage for bonding two chips patterned with superconducting thin films. We use a gold-passivated niobium or niobium nitride layer as an under-bump metallization (UBM) layer between an aluminum-based superconducting wiring layer and the indium interconnect. At millikelvin temperatures, our flip-chip assembly can transport a supercurrent with tens of milliamperes, limited by the smallest geometric feature size and critical current density of the UBM layer and not by the indium interconnect. We show that the pressed indium interconnect itself can carry a supercurrent exceeding 1 A due to its large size of about 500 mu m diameter. Our flip-chip assembly does require neither electroplating nor patterning of indium. The assembly process does not need a flip-chip bonder and can be realized with a transfer stage using a top chip with transparency or through-vias for alignment. These flip-chip devices can be utilized in applications that require few superconducting interconnects carrying large currents at millikelvin temperatures.

TI Fiber-based 3D nano-printed holography with individually
   phase-engineered remote points
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB The generation of tailored light fields with spatially controlled intensity and phase distribution is essential in many areas of science and application, while creating such patterns remotely has recently defined a key challenge. Here, we present a fiber-compatible concept for the remote generation of complex multi-foci three-dimensional intensity patterns with adjusted relative phases between individual foci. By extending the well-known Huygens principle, we demonstrate, in simulations and experiments, that our interference-based approach enables controlling of both intensity and phase of individual focal points in an array of spots distributed in all three spatial directions. Holograms were implemented using 3D nano-printing on planar substrates and optical fibers, showing excellent agreement between design and implemented structures. In addition to planar substrates, holograms were also generated on modified single-mode fibers, creating intensity distributions consisting of about 200 individual foci distributed over multiple image planes. The presented scheme yields an innovative pathway for phase-controlled 3D digital holography over remote distances, yielding an enormous potential application in fields such as quantum technology, life sciences, bioanalytics and telecommunications. Overall, all fields requiring precise excitation of higher-order optical resonances, including nanophotonics, fiber optics and waveguide technology, will benefit from the concept.

TI Giant All-Optical Modulation of Second-Harmonic Generation Mediated by
   Dark Excitons
SO ACS PHOTONICS
AB All-optical control of nonlinear photonic processes in nanomaterials is of significant interest from a fundamental viewpoint and with regard to applications ranging from ultrafast data processing to spectroscopy and quantum technology. However, these applications rely on a high degree of control over the nonlinear response, which still remains elusive. Here, we demonstrate giant and broadband all-optical ultrafast modulation of second-harmonic generation (SHG) in monolayer transition-metal dichalcogenides mediated by the modified excitonic oscillation strength produced upon optical pumping. We reveal a dominant role of dark excitons to enhance SHG by up to a factor of similar to 386 at room temperature, 2 orders of magnitude larger than the current state-of-the-art all-optical modulation results. The amplitude and sign of the observed SHG modulation can be adjusted over a broad spectral range spanning a few electronvolts with ultrafast response down to the sub-picosecond scale via different carrier dynamics. Our results not only introduce an efficient method to study intriguing exciton dynamics, but also reveal a new mechanism involving dark excitons to regulate all-optical nonlinear photonics.

TI Scanning tunneling microscopy of ultrathin indium intercalated between
   graphene and SiC using confinement heteroepitaxy
SO APPLIED PHYSICS LETTERS
AB Large-scale and air-stable two-dimensional metal layers intercalated at the interface between epitaxial graphene and SiC offer an appealing material for quantum technology. The atomic and electronic details, as well as the control of the intercalated metals within the interface, however, remain very limited. In this Letter, we explored ultrathin indium confined between graphene and SiC using cryogenic scanning tunneling microscopy, complemented by first-principle density functional theory. Bias-dependent imaging and tunneling spectroscopy visualize a triangular superstructure with a periodicity of 14.7 +/- 3 & Aring; and an occupied state at about -1.6 eV, indicating proof of highly crystalline indium. The scanning tunneling microscopy tip was used to manipulate the number of indium layers below graphene, allowing to identify three monatomic In layers and to tune their corresponding electronic properties with atomic precision. This further allows us to attribute the observed triangular superstructure to be solely emerging from the In trilayer, tentatively explained by the lattice mismatch induced by lattice relaxation in the topmost In layer. Our findings provide a microscopic insight into the structure and electronic properties of intercalated metals within the graphene/SiC interface and a unique possibility to manipulate them with atomic precision using the scanning probe technique.

TI The kinetics of carbon pair formation in silicon prohibits reaching
   thermal equilibrium
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Thermal equilibrium is reached when the system assumes its lowest energy. This can be hindered by kinetic reasons; however, it is a general assumption that the ground state can be eventually reached. Here, we show that this is not always necessarily the case. Carbon pairs in silicon have at least three different configurations, one of them (B-configuration) is the G photoluminescence centre. Experiments revealed a bistable nature with the A-configuration. Electronic structure calculations predicted that the C-configuration is the real ground state; however, no experimental evidence was found for its existence. Our calculations show that the formation of the A- and B-configurations is strongly favoured over the most stable C-configuration which cannot be realized in a detectable amount before the pair dissociates. Our results demonstrate that automatized search for complex defects consisting of only the thermodynamically most stable configurations may overlook key candidates for quantum technology applications.
   Computational search for defect centers in semiconductors typically assumes that the defects realize the most thermodynamically stable configuration. Here the authors demonstrate, for a complex defect in silicon, that this is not always the case if the kinetics of defect formation is taken into account.

TI A bimodal lattice-based linearly homomorphic signature for chain-based
   implicit data storage scheme
SO DISCOVER COMPUTING
AB As the demand for cross-domain collaborative verification grows in fields such as healthcare and industrial Internet of Things, achieving secure and efficient verification of heterogeneous data has become a critical challenge. Traditional linear homomorphic signature schemes face a dilemma: if multi-modal data is merged into a single signature, although the integrity is preserved, it leads to inefficiencies as the entire dataset must be reconstructed and re-signed upon local updates, making it susceptible to padding rule attacks; if signed independently, the cross-domain logical associations are disrupted, allowing attackers to conduct combinatorial fraud by substituting signatures from individual domains. To address these challenges, this paper proposes an innovative solution. Firstly, based on the lattice intersection method and the Chinese Remainder Theorem, a Bimodal Linearly Homomorphic Signature Scheme (BLHS) is designed: by constructing a bimodal lattice structure using coprime moduli, two types of heterogeneous data are embedded into interlocked algebraic spaces, generating short signatures that satisfy cross-domain constraints. The security of this scheme is reduced to the computational hardness of the Short Integer Solution (SIS) problem, strictly proving its unforgeability, and achieving weak context hiding to ensure the privacy of original data during linear combination operations. Secondly, with the rapid development of distributed technologies such as the Internet of Things and blockchain, the long-term storage of massive amounts of interrelated data faces dual challenges of space efficiency and cross-domain verification. Traditional data storage methods exhibit linear growth in storage overhead with respect to data length. To address the space efficiency bottleneck in long-term data storage, based on the proposed BLHS scheme, a Chain-based Implicit Data Storage Scheme (CIDSS) is introduced. The core idea of this scheme is to compress a data sequence into a single end signature for storage through chain-based recursive binding and implicit encoding, thereby achieving constant-level space complexity. The term "chain-based" refers to the use of NTRU equations over polynomial rings to recursively bind the current signature to the generation process of subsequent data blocks, forming an unforgeable dependency chain. The term "implicit" refers to storing only the end signature and recovering the complete historical data layer by layer through reverse solving of the NTRU equation. Theoretical analysis indicates that the scheme trades computational burden for storage efficiency, reducing the traditional explicit storage's O(k) space overhead to a constant level, making it suitable for long-term data archiving and verification scenarios in resource-constrained environments.

TI Strategies for simulating the time evolution of Hamiltonian lattice
   field theories
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Simulating the time evolution of quantum field theories given some Hamiltonian H requires developing algorithms for implementing the unitary operator e-iHt. A variety of techniques exist that accomplish this task, with the most common technique used so far being Trotterization, which is a special case of the application of a product formula. However, other techniques exist that promise better asymptotic scaling in certain parameters of the theory being simulated, the most efficient of which are based on the concept of block encoding. In this work we study the performance of such algorithms in simulating lattice field theories. We derive and compare the asymptotic gate complexities of several commonly used simulation techniques in application to Hamiltonian lattice field theories. Using the scalar phi 4 theory as a test, we also perform numerical studies and compare the gate costs required by product formulas and signal-processing-based techniques to simulate time evolution. For the latter, we use the linear combination of unitaries (LCU) construction augmented with the quantum Fourier transform circuit to switch between the field and momentum eigenbases, which leads to immediate order-of-magnitude improvement in the cost of preparing the block encoding. This paper also includes a pedagogical review of the techniques used, in particular product formulas, LCU, qubitization, quantum signal processing, as well as the technique for simulating geometrically-local Hamiltonians developed by Haah, Hastings, Kothari, and Low.

TI Mechanical performance dataset for alloy with applications at low
   temperatures
SO SCIENTIFIC DATA
AB Modern technologies such as liquid fuels (hydrogen, oxygen), superconductivity, and quantum technology require materials to serve at very low temperatures, pushing the bounds of material performance by demanding a combination of strength and toughness to tackle various challenges. Steel alloys are among the most commonly used materials in cryogenic applications. Meanwhile, aluminum and titanium alloys are increasingly recognized for their potential in aerospace and the transportation sectors. Emerging multi-principal element alloys such as medium-entropy and high-entropy alloys offer superior low-temperature mechanical performance, greatly expanding the space for material design. A comprehensive dataset of these low-temperature metallic alloys has been curated from literature and made available in an open repository to meet the need for validated data sources in research and development. The dataset construction workflow incorporates automated extraction using state-of-the-art machine learning and natural language processing techniques, supplemented by manual inspection and correction to improve data extraction efficiency and ensure dataset quality. The product dataset encompasses key performance parameters such as yield strength, tensile strength, elongation at fracture, and Charpy impact energy. The accompanying metadata, detailing material types, chemical compositions, processing and testing conditions, are provided in a standardized format to promote data-driven research in material screening, design, and discovery.

TI Toward Secure and Resilient Networks: A Zero-Trust Security Framework
   with Quantum Fingerprinting for Devices Accessing Network
SO MATHEMATICS
AB The importance of network security has increased with the emergence of networked systems in contemporary computing, making it an essential aspect of protecting digital assets and safeguarding against cyber threats. The current security mechanisms, which rely on cryptographic keys, may be susceptible to a number of attacks, such as media access control (MAC) spoofing, which might provide unauthorized users access to network resources. This study introduces a new approach, namely a zero-trust security framework with quantum fingerprinting for devices accessing a network, that utilizes quantum technology to protect networks from security threats and intruders. The proposed architecture relies on quantum fingerprinting to authenticate devices trying to access the network, and it is built on the zero-trust security concept. The framework is intended to offer a thorough, multi-layered approach to network security that may change in response to evolving security risks and specifications. By protecting against MAC spoofing and other types of device impersonation, the adoption of quantum fingerprinting adds another degree of protection. The proposed framework may be used to construct a reliable and scalable network security solution in different network environments.

TI Sympathetic cooling of a trapped proton mediated by an LC circuit
SO NATURE
AB Efficient cooling of trapped charged particles is essential to many fundamental physics experiments(1,2), to high-precision metrology(3,4) and to quantum technology(5,6). Until now, sympathetic cooling has required close-range Coulomb interactions(7,8), but there has been a sustained desire to bring laser-cooling techniques to particles in macroscopically separated traps(5,9,10), extending quantum control techniques to previously inaccessible particles such as highly charged ions, molecular ions and antimatter. Here we demonstrate sympathetic cooling of a single proton using laser-cooled Be+ ions in spatially separated Penning traps. The traps are connected by a superconducting LC circuit that enables energy exchange over a distance of 9 cm. We also demonstrate the cooling of a resonant mode of a macroscopic LC circuit with laser-cooled ions and sympathetic cooling of an individually trapped proton, reaching temperatures far below the environmental temperature. Notably, as this technique uses only image-current interactions, it can be easily applied to an experiment with antiprotons(1), facilitating improved precision in matter-antimatter comparisons(11) and dark matter searches(12,13).
   A single electromagnetically trapped proton is sympathetically cooled to below ambient temperature by coupling it through a superconducting LC circuit to a laser-cooled cloud of Be+ ions stored in a spatially separated trap.

TI Spectral recovery of broadband waveforms via cross-phase modulation
   based tunable Talbot amplifier
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB Physical processes in the Fourier domain play a crucial role in various applications such as spectroscopy, quantum technology, ranging, radio -astronomy, and telecommunications. However, the presence of stochastic noise poses a significant challenge in the detection of broadband spectral waveforms, especially those with limited power. In this study, we propose and experimentally demonstrate a cross -phase modulation (XPM) based spectral Talbot amplifier to recover the broadband spectral waveforms in high fidelity. Through the combination of spectral phase filtering and XPM nonlinear effect in an all -fiber configuration, we demonstrate spectral purification of THz-bandwidth spectral waveforms submerged in strong noise. The proposed spectral Talbot amplifier provides tunable amplification factors from 3 to 10, achieved by flexible control on the temporal waveform of the pump and the net dispersion. We demonstrate up to 10 -dB remarkable improvement on optical signal-to-noise ratio (OSNR) while preserving the spectral envelope. Furthermore, our system allows frequency -selective reconstruction of noisy input spectra, introducing a new level of flexibility for spectral recovery and information extraction. We also evaluate numerically the impact of pump intensity deviation on the reconstructed spectral waveforms. Our all -optical approach presents a powerful means for effective recovery of broadband spectral waveforms, enabling information extraction from a noise -buried background.

TI Rapid generation of all-optical 39K Bose-Einstein condensates using a
   low-field Feshbach resonance
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Ultracold potassium is an interesting candidate for quantum technology applications and fundamental research as it allows controlling intra-atomic interactions via low-field magnetic Feshbach resonances. However, the realization of high-flux sources of Bose-Einstein condensates remains challenging due to the necessity of optical trapping to use magnetic fields as free parameters. We investigate the production of all-optical 39K Bose-Einstein condensates with different scattering lengths using a Feshbach resonance near 33 G. By tuning the scattering length in a range between 75a0 and 300a0 we demonstrate a tradeoff between evaporation speed and final atom number and decrease our evaporation time by a factor of 5 while approximately doubling the evaporation flux. To this end, we are able to produce fully condensed ensembles with 5.8 x 104 atoms within 850-ms evaporation time at a scattering length of 232a0 and 1.6 x 105 atoms within 3.9 s at 158a0, respectively. We deploy a numerical model to analyze the flux and atom number scaling with respect to scattering length, identify current limitations, and simulate the optimal performance of our setup. Based on our findings we describe routes towards high-flux sources of ultracold potassium for inertial sensing.

TI Outcomes from a workshop on a national center for quantum education
SO EPJ QUANTUM TECHNOLOGY
AB In response to numerous programs seeking to advance quantum education and workforce development in the United States, experts from academia, industry, government, and professional societies convened for a National Science Foundation-sponsored workshop in February 2024 to explore the benefits and challenges of establishing a national center for quantum education. Broadly, such a center would foster collaboration and build the infrastructure required to develop a diverse and quantum-ready workforce. The workshop discussions focused on how a center could uniquely address gaps in public, K-12, and undergraduate quantum information science and engineering (QISE) education. Specifically, the community identified activities that, through a center, could lead to an increase in student awareness of quantum careers, boost the number of educators trained in quantum-related subjects, strengthen pathways into quantum careers, enhance the understanding of the US quantum workforce, and elevate public engagement with QISE. Core proposed activities for the center include professional development for educators, coordinated curriculum development and curation, expanded access to educational laboratory equipment, robust evaluation and assessment practices, network building, and enhanced public engagement with quantum science.

TI External Control Over Magnon-Magnon Coupling in a Two-Dimensional Array
   of Square-Shaped Nanomagnets
SO ADVANCED QUANTUM TECHNOLOGIES
AB The field of hybrid magnonics has gained significant momentum in recent years, driven by its potential to enable coherent information transfer and quantum transduction. This study delves into the tunable magnon-magnon coupling within a two-dimensional (2D) array of Ni80Fe20 (Permalloy) square nanomagnets by modulating its internal magnetic field configuration. Using a broadband ferromagnetic resonance (FMR) spectroscopy, the influence of the orientation of external magnetic field and microwave power on the coupling properties are systematically investigated. These findings reveal a pronounced anticrossing behavior, indicative of robust magnon-magnon coupling, whose strength can be tuned through both static and dynamic external parameters. The ability to modulate coupling strengths in this system highlights its potential for developing flexible and adaptive magnonic devices, crucial for future applications in quantum information processing and spintronic technologies. This work not only broadens the understanding of magnon-magnon interactions in complex geometries but also opens new avenues for the design of next-generation quantum magnonic systems.

TI Synchronous micromechanically resonant programmable photonic circuits
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Programmable photonic integrated circuits (PICs) are emerging as powerful tools for control of light, with applications in quantum information processing, optical range finding, and artificial intelligence. Low-power implementations of these PICs involve micromechanical structures driven capacitively or piezoelectrically but are often limited in modulation bandwidth by mechanical resonances and high operating voltages. Here we introduce a synchronous, micromechanically resonant design architecture for programmable PICs and a proof-of-principle 1x8 photonic switch using piezoelectric optical phase shifters. Our design purposefully exploits high-frequency mechanical resonances and optically broadband components for larger modulation responses on the order of the mechanical quality factor Qm while maintaining fast switching speeds. We experimentally show switching cycles of all 8 channels spaced by approximately 11 ns and operating at 4.6 dB average modulation enhancement. Future advances in micromechanical devices with high Qm, which can exceed 10000, should enable an improved series of low-voltage and high-speed programmable PICs.
   MEMS-based photonic integrated circuits (PICs) are often limited in speed by mechanical resonances. Here the authors report a programmable architecture for PICs which uses mechanical eigenmodes for synchronized, resonantly enhanced optical modulation.

TI Gaps labeling theorem for the bubble-diamond self-similar graphs
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICS A-MATHEMATICAL AND THEORETICAL
AB Motivated by the appearance of fractals in several areas of physics, especially in solid state physics and the physics of aperiodic order, and in other sciences, including the quantum information theory, we present a detailed spectral analysis for a new class of fractal-type diamond graphs, referred to as bubble-diamond graphs, and provide a gap-labeling theorem in the sense of Bellissard for the corresponding probabilistic graph Laplacians using the technique of spectral decimation. Labeling the gaps in the Cantor set by the normalized eigenvalue counting function, also known as the integrated density of states, we describe the gap labels as orbits of a second dynamical system that reflects the branching parameter of the bubble construction and the decimation structure. The spectrum of the natural Laplacian on limit graphs is shown generically to be pure point supported on a Cantor set, though one particular graph has a mixture of pure point and singularly continuous components.

TI 3D permanent magnetic lattices for ultracold atoms
SO PHYSICA SCRIPTA
AB We introduce 3D permanent magnetic lattices for ultracold atoms which can be created by arbitrary number of 2D arrays of square permanent magnetic slabs plus a bias magnetic field. Instead of the square magnets, we can also use magnetic films with square holes. We find analytical expressions for the location of the nonzero magnetic field minima and physical quantities such as trap depths, absolute value of the magnetic field and curvatures as well as trap frequencies at each minimum. We show that most of them, including the trap depths, modulation depths, and trap frequencies can be controlled by the bias field. Accessible trap depths and trap frequencies in the permanent magnetic lattices are much higher compared to the optical lattices. Between the magnetic layers, the trap frequencies are higher compared to above the top layer (under the bottom layer). In principle, our method can be generalized to other 2D permanent magnetic lattices and we show how to transform a 2D lattice of a given geometry into 3D by using multiple layers of magnets.

TI Constructing multipartite Bell inequalities from stabilizers
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Bell inequality with a self-testing property has played an important role in quantum information processing with both fundamental and practical significance. However, it is generally challenging to find Bell inequalities used for self-testing multipartite states, and actually, there are not many known candidates. In this work we propose a systematic framework to construct Bell inequalities from stabilizers which are maximally violated by general stabilizer states, with two observables for each local party. We show that the constructed Bell inequalities can self-test any stabilizer state if and only if these stabilizers can uniquely determine the state in a device -dependent manner. This bridges the gap between device-independent and device-dependent verification methods. Our framework can provide plenty of Bell inequalities for self-testing N-party stabilizer states. Among them, we give two families of Bell inequalities with different advantages: (1) a family of Bell inequalities with a constant ratio of quantum and classical bounds using 2N correlations, and (2) single pair inequalities improving on all previous robustness self-testing bounds using N + 1 correlations, which are both efficient and robust for realizations in multipartite systems.

TI Noise resilience in path-polarization hyperentangled probe states
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICS B-ATOMIC MOLECULAR AND OPTICAL PHYSICS
AB Most quantum systems that are used for generating entanglement and for practical applications are not isolated from the environment, and are hence susceptible to noise. Entanglement in more than one degree of freedom between two systems, known as hyperentanglement, is known to have certain advantages, including robustness against noise over conventional entangled states. Quantum illumination, imaging and communication schemes that involve sending one photon from a pair of entangled photons and retaining the other photon usually involve exposing only the signal photon to environmental noise. The disruptive nature of noise degrades entanglement and other correlations which are crucial for many of these applications. In this paper, we study the advantages of using photon pairs in certain path-polarization hyperentangled states in a noisy interaction where photons in only one of the paths are affected by noise. We model such noise and study the effect of noise on the correlations present in the hyperentangled photons. Three different methods, entanglement negativity, entanglement witnesses and Bell nonlocality are used to show the resilience of path-polarization hyperentangled probe state against noise.

   phononic crystals
SO NATURE ELECTRONICS
AB Topological phononic crystals can manipulate elastic waves that propagate in solids without being backscattered, and could be used to develop integrated acousto-electronic systems for classical and quantum information processing. However, acoustic topological metamaterials have been mainly limited to macroscale systems that operate at low (kilohertz to megahertz) frequencies. Here we report a topological valley Hall effect in nanoelectromechanical aluminium nitride membranes at gigahertz (up to 1.06 GHz) frequencies. We visualize the propagation of elastic waves through phononic crystals with high sensitivity (10-100 fm) and spatial resolution (10-100 nm) using transmission-mode microwave impedance microscopy. The valley Hall edge states, which are protected by band topology, are observed in both real and momentum space. Robust valley-polarized transport is evident from wave transmission across local disorder and around sharp corners. We also show that the system can be used to create an acoustic beamsplitter.
   High-frequency elastic waves can propagate across local disorder and around sharp corners in nanoelectromechanical aluminium nitride membranes; this behaviour can be directly imaged using microwave microscopy.

TI Nonvolatile voltage-tunable ferroelectric-superconducting quantum
   interference memory devices
SO APPLIED PHYSICS LETTERS
AB Superconductivity serves as a unique solid-state platform for electron interference at a device-relevant lengthscale, which is essential for quantum information and sensing technologies. As opposed to semiconducting transistors that are operated by voltage biasing at the nanometer scale, superconductive quantum devices cannot sustain voltage and are operated with magnetic fields, which impose a large device footprint, hindering miniaturization and scalability. Here, we introduce a system of superconducting materials and devices that have a common interface with a ferroelectric layer. An amorphous superconductor was chosen for reducing substrate-induced misfit strain and for allowing low-temperature growth. The common quantum pseudowavefunction of the superconducting electrons was controlled by the nonvolatile switchable polarization of the ferroelectric by means of voltage biasing. A controllable change of 21% in the critical temperature was demonstrated for a continuous film geometry. Moreover, a controllable change of 54% in the switching current of a superconducting quantum interference device was demonstrated. The ability to voltage bias superconducting devices together with the nonvolatile nature of this system paves the way to quantum-based memory devices.

TI Anisotropic Magnon-Magnon Coupling in Synthetic Antiferromagnets
SO CHINESE PHYSICS LETTERS
AB Magnon-magnon coupling in synthetic antiferromagnets advances it as hybrid magnonic systems to explore the quantum information technologies. To induce magnon-magnon coupling, the parity symmetry between two magnetization needs to be broken. Here we experimentally demonstrate a convenient method to break the parity symmetry by the asymmetric structure. We successfully introduce a magnon-magnon coupling in Ir-based synthetic antiferromagnets CoFeB(10 nm)/Ir(t (Ir) = 0.6 nm, 1.2 nm)/CoFeB(13 nm). Remarkably, we find that the weakly uniaxial anisotropy field (similar to 20 Oe) makes the magnon-magnon coupling anisotropic. The coupling strength presented by a characteristic anticrossing gap varies in the range between 0.54 GHz and 0.90 GHz for t (Ir) = 0.6 nm, and between 0.09 GHz and 1.4 GHz for t (Ir) = 1.2 nm. Our results demonstrate a feasible way to induce magnon-magnon coupling by an asymmetric structure and tune the coupling strength by varying the direction of in-plane magnetic field. The magnon-magnon coupling in this highly tunable material system could open exciting perspectives for exploring quantum-mechanical coupling phenomena.

TI SPECTRAL ANALYSIS OF MATRIX SCALING AND OPERATOR SCALING
SO SIAM JOURNAL ON COMPUTING
AB We present a spectral analysis of a continuous scaling algorithm for matrix scaling and operator scaling. The main result is that if the input matrix or operator has a spectral gap, then a natural gradient flow has linear convergence. This implies that a simple gradient descent algorithm also has linear convergence under the same assumption. The spectral gap condition for operator scaling is closely related to the notion of quantum expander studied in quantum information theory. The spectral analysis also provides bounds on some important quantities of the scaling problems, such as the condition number of the scaling solution and the capacity of the matrix and operator. These results can be used in various applications of scaling problems, including matrix scaling on expander graphs, permanent lower bounds on random matrices, the Paulsen problem on random frames, and Brascamp Lieb constants on random operators. In some applications, the inputs of interest satisfy the spectral condition and we prove significantly stronger bounds than the worst case bounds.

TI THz-assisted population inversion in strong-field excitation
SO SCIENTIA SINICA-PHYSICA MECHANICA & ASTRONOMICA
AB Strong-field excitation provides new methods and means for coherent population of Rydberg states. In this study, we numerically solve the time-dependent Schro<spacing diaeresis>dinger equation to investigate the strong-field excitation and radiation dynamics under the cooperative interaction of terahertz (THz) and femtosecond strong laser pulses. In the radiation spectrum, the Rydberg states excited by the strong field are manifested as resonance peaks with energy below the ionization threshold. By using THz fields to control the electron motion on sub-optical cycles, we achieve modulation of Rydberg state population and high-order harmonic radiation under the influence of a strong laser field. We analyze the variation of the excited state population with THz intensity, frequency, and the angle between the infrared field polarization and the THz field. Our results show that, with the assistance of the THz field, population inversion occurs between the Rydberg states. This study provides a feasible scheme for THz amplification based on Rydberg atoms and holds significant implications for THz amplification, high-sensitivity detection, and quantum information processing.

TI Sculpting photoproducts with DNA origami
SO CHEM
AB Natural light -harvesting systems spatially organize densely packed dyes in different configurations to either transport excitons or convert them into charged photoproducts, with high efficiency. In contrast, artificial photosystems like organic solar cells and lightemitting diodes lack this fine structural control, limiting their efficiency. Thus, biomimetic multi -dye systems are needed to organize dyes with the sub-nanometer spatial control required to "sculpt"resulting photoproducts. Here, we synthesize 11 distinct perylene diimide (PDI) dimers integrated into DNA origami nanostructures and identify dimer architectures that offer discrete control over exciton transport versus charge separation. The large structural space and site tunability of origami uniquely provide controlled PDI dimer packing to form distinct excimer photoproducts that are sensitive to interdye configurations. In the future, this platform will enable large-scale programmed assembly of dyes mimicking natural systems to sculpt distinct photophysical products needed for a broad range of optoelectronic devices, including solar energy converters and quantum information processors.

TI Electro-optically programmable photonic circuits enabled by wafer-scale
   integration on thin-film lithium niobate
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Programmable photonic circuits performing universal linear-optical transformations underpin vital functions in photonic quantum information processing, quantum-enhanced sensor networks, machine learning, and many other intriguing applications. Recent advances in photonic integrated circuits facilitate monolithic integration of externally controlled Mach-Zehnder interferometers (MZIs) which can implement arbitrary unitary transformation on a large number of input/output modes. In this work, we demonstrate a 4 x 4 programmable linear photonic circuit on lithium niobate on an insulator platform employing fast, power-efficient, and low-loss electro-optical phase shifters, showing enormous advantages in terms of configuration rate and power consumption. Our device composed of cascaded MZIs possesses a total on-chip power dissipation of only 1.5 mW when operating at 100 MHz modulation rate. Our MZIs exhibit high bandwidth of 22.5 GHz, fast switching with 160-ps rise time and 120-ps fall time, low insertion loss of 0.15 dB, and on-chip extinction ratio of -34 dB for both cross and bar routes.

TI Geometric origin of intrinsic dark counts in superconducting nanowire
   single-photon detectors
SO SUPERCONDUCTIVITY
AB The dark count is one of the key physical issues for superconducting nanowire single-photon detectors (SNSPDs) that limits various applications for optical quantum information and classical optics. When the bias current approaches the switching current of SNSPDs, the dark count is actually dominated by the intrinsic dark counts (iDCs). However, the origin of iDCs and its relation to constrictions remains unclear for practical SNSPDs. We herein systematically characterize the iDCs of the SNSPDs with and without artificial geometric constrictions by applying the differential readout method. For these devices with constrictions, we have observed distinct Gaussian distributions in the temporal distribution of iDCs, in which the time difference between the distributions is consistent with the geometric distance between constrictions, and the rates of iDCs produced by each constriction are in good agreement with constrictions' widths. With respect to practical SNSPDs, surprisingly, we also observe several Gaussian distributions in the temporal domain and it shows no significant dependence on the devices' sizes, demonstrating that the iDCs of SNSPDs are mainly dominated by a few specific constrictions.

TI Electron-spin interaction in the spin-Peierls phase of the organic spin
   chain (o-DMTTF)2X (X=Cl, Br, I)
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
AB We investigate the electron spin resonance of the organic spin-Peierls chain (o-DMTTF)2X with X = Cl, Br, and I. We describe the temperature dependence of the spin gap during the phase transition and quantify the dimerization parameter 8. At the lowest temperatures, the susceptibility is governed by defects in the spin dimerized chain. Such strongly correlated defects are the consequence of breaks in the translational symmetry of the chain. In the vicinity of the defects the spins are polarized antiferomagnetically forming a magnetic soliton: a spin 12 quasiparticle of size ruled by 8 pinned to the defects. For (o-DMTTF)2Br and (o-DMTTF)2Cl, we show that the one-half of the total number of solitons are in isolation (as singles) whereas the other half form pairs (soliton dimers) with a strong magnetic coupling. The Rabi oscillations of both the single soliton and the soliton dimer are observed, which is a prerequisite in the context of quantum information.

TI Single-Photon Emitters in Layered Van der Waals Materials
SO PHYSICA STATUS SOLIDI B-BASIC SOLID STATE PHYSICS
AB Single-photon emitters (SPEs) have recently been discovered in various atomically thin materials. Their properties, controllability, and the possibility of their monolithic integration in electronic and photonic device structures make them attractive candidates for a wide range of applications in quantum information and communication, and also in other fields of physics and technology. In this review article, an overview of SPEs in layered van der Waals materials and their physical properties is given, theoretical concepts for the modeling of their level structure and their coupling to phonons are presented, and techniques for the creation and localization of these emitters in the host material are described. Perspectives for their application in various fields, such as their coupling to photonic resonators and waveguides, their control by external electric fields or strain, and their integration in optomechanical devices are discussed. Finally, functionalities relying on properties beyond single-photon emission are briefly addressed.

TI Measurement of the thulium ion spin Hamiltonian in an yttrium gallium
   garnet host crystal
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
AB We characterize the magnetic properties for thulium ion energy levels in the Y3Ga5O12 (Tm:YGG) lattice with the goal to improve decoherence and reduce linewidth broadening caused by local host spins and crystal imperfections. More precisely, we measure hyperfine tensors for the lowest level of H-3(6) and excited H-3(4) states using a combination of spectral hole burning, absorption spectroscopy, and optically detected nuclear magnetic resonance. By rotating the sample through a series of angles with an applied external magnetic field, we measure and analyze the orientation dependence of the Tm3+ ion's spin Hamiltonian. Using this spin Hamiltonian, we propose a set of orientations to improve material properties that are important for light-matter interaction and quantum information applications. Our results yield several important external field directions: some to extend optical coherence times, another to improve spin inhomogeneous broadening, and yet another that maximizes mixing of the spin states for specific sets of ions, which allows improving optical pumping and creation of lambda systems in this material.

TI Adiabatic speedup in cutting a spin chain via zero-area pulse control
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB The adiabatic quantum information processing task requires that the evolution of a system must be kept in its instantaneous eigenstate. However, normally the adiabaticity will be ruined due to the interaction between the system and the noisy environment in its long evolution time. Here, in this paper, we show that zero-area pulse control can be used to realize the adiabatic process in a nonadiabatic regime. A concrete example is provided where one spin chain is cut into two chains. The pulse function is applied in the laboratory frame and suitable pulse conditions are obtained numerically. We find that compared with the pulse conditions obtained in the adiabatic frame, the results are similar for low-energy-level systems but tend to deviate when the system's energy level increases. We then obtain the pulse conditions theoretically by writing the control Hamiltonian in the adiabatic frame. It is found that a sequence of pulses with intensities tuned by a time-dependent energy difference is required to guarantee an effective adiabatic speedup.

TI Photonics Breakthroughs 2024: Nearfield Observation of Spin-Orbit
   Interactions at Nanoscale
SO IEEE PHOTONICS JOURNAL
AB The spin-orbit interaction (SOI) of light describes the interaction between spin angular momentum, related to circular polarization, and orbital angular momentum, associated with spatial wavefront structures. While typically trivial in conventional farfield optics, the SOI can become significant at subwavelength scales in the nearfield, where complex vectorial light fields arise. This phenomenon offers exciting prospects for applications in micro-/nano-photonic devices, optical sensing and quantum information technology. In this review, we highlight recent advances in the investigation of the SOI, with particular emphasis on the demonstration of accurate nearfield SOI characterization using photoinduced force microscopy. This technique enables direct, high-resolution mapping of longitudinal and transverse nearfield components of sharply focused optical vortex beams, providing quantitative insight into the spin-to-orbit conversion process. We also discuss existing challenges and outline future directions for exploratory research on the SOI of light in advanced optical systems.

TI Spatially Deterministic Integration of hBN Single-Photon Emitters on SiN
   Waveguides Via Femtosecond Laser Processing
SO ADVANCED OPTICAL MATERIALS
AB A post-fabrication method is demonstrated that enables spatially deterministic integration of hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) single-photon emitters onto silicon nitride (SiN) waveguides. Mechanically exfoliated hBN flakes are dry-transferred onto pre-fabricated SiN waveguides, and localized femtosecond laser irradiation is employed to induce defects with sub-microscale spatial precision. Confocal photoluminescence mapping reveals multiple laser-written bright defects, among which one emitter exhibits narrow spectral linewidth and polarization dependence characteristic of a dipole emitter. The emitter exhibits high brightness and temporal stability, and second-order photon correlation measurements confirm its single-photon nature. Furthermore, on-chip excitation via the SiN waveguide is successfully achieved, demonstrating the compatibility of the approach with mature photonic platform technologies. This deterministic integration technique offers a scalable pathway for incorporating quantum emitters into photonic circuits, paving the way for the development of quantum information processing and communication systems with 2D material hybrid photonic devices.

TI First Encapsulation of Organometallic Single-Molecule Magnet into
   Single-Walled Carbon Nanotubes
SO ANGEWANDTE CHEMIE-INTERNATIONAL EDITION
AB An air-sensitive DyCp3 (Cp- = cyclopentadienyl) single-molecule magnet (SMM) complex (1) is encapsulated into single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) to construct hybrid materials that are resistant to moisture and oxygen. The hybrid materials with independent slow-magnetic-relaxing centers are expected to become a key component of the next generation of information process devices based on spintronics. The resilience to moisture and oxygen further broadens its manufacturing methods and application scenarios. Furthermore, upon encapsulation into SWCNTs, DyCp3 exhibited clear ac frequency dependence in the ac magnetic susceptibility at a zero-dc field. This indicates that the guest molecule's slow magnetic relaxation properties are preserved, which is crucial and necessary to realize SMMs-based quantum information processing, by allowing a sufficient time window for quantum gate operations. This result exemplifies that encapsulation of air-sensitive organometallic SMMs into SWCNTs enhances their chemical stability and their magnetic relaxation time at a zero-dc magnetic field, which provides a novel method for their further applications.

TI A programmable platform for photonic topological insulators
SO NANOPHOTONICS
AB In the past decade, the field of topological photonics has gained prominence exhibiting consequential effects in quantum information science, lasing, and large-scale integrated photonics. Many of these topological systems exhibit protected states, enabling robust travel along their edges without being affected by defects or disorder. Nonetheless, conventional topological structures often lack the flexibility for implementing different topological models and for tunability postfabrication. Here, we present a method to implement magnetic-like Hamiltonians supporting topologically protected edge modes on a general-purpose programmable silicon photonic mesh of interferometers. By reconfiguring the lattice onto a two-dimensional mesh of ring resonators with carefully tuned couplings, we show robust edge state transport even in the presence of manufacturing tolerance defects. We showcase the system's reconfigurability by demonstrating topological insulator lattices of different sizes and shapes and introduce edge and bulk defects to underscore the robustness of the photonic edge states. Our study paves the way for the implementation of photonic topological insulators on general-purpose programmable photonics platforms.

TI Coherent control of an optical tweezer phonon laser
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB The creation and manipulation of coherence continues to capture the attention of scientists and engineers. The optical laser is a canonical example of a system that, in principle, exhibits complete coherence. Recent research has focused on the creation of coherent, laser -like states in other physical systems. The phonon laser is one example where it is possible to amplify self -sustained mechanical oscillations. A single mode phonon laser in a levitated optical tweezer has been demonstrated through appropriate balance of active feedback gain and damping. In this work, coherent control of the dynamics of an optical tweezer phonon laser is used to share coherence between its different modes of oscillation, creating a multimode phonon laser. The coupling of the modes is achieved by periodically rotating the asymmetric optical potential in the transverse focal plane of the trapping beam via trap laser polarization rotation. The presented theory and experiment demonstrate that coherence can be transferred across different modes of an optical tweezer phonon laser, and are a step toward using these systems for precision measurement and quantum information processing.

TI Strong coupling of quantum emitters and the exciton polariton in
   MoS2 nanodisks
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
AB As a quasiparticle formed by light and excitons in semiconductors, the exciton polariton (EP) as a quantum bus is promising for the development of quantum interconnect devices at room temperature. However, the significant damping of EPs in the material generally causes a loss of quantum information. We propose a mechanism to overcome the destructive effect of a damping EP on its mediated correlation dynamics of quantum emitters (QEs). Via an investigation of the near-field coupling between two QEs and the EP in a monolayer MoS2 nanodisk, we find that, with the complete dissipation of the QEs efficiently avoided, a persistent quantum correlation between the QEs can be generated and stabilized even to their steady state. This is due to the fact that, upon decreasing the QE-MoS2 distance, the QEs become so hybridized with the EP that one or two bound states are formed between them. Our result supplies a useful way to avoid the destructive impact of EP damping, and it refreshes our understanding of the light-matter interaction in an absorbing medium.

TI Robust population transfer of spin states by geometric formalism
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Accurate population transfer of uncoupled or weakly coupled spin states is crucial for many quantum information-processing tasks. In this paper, we propose a fast and robust scheme for population transfer which combines invariant-based inverse engineering and geometric formalism for robust quantum control. Our scheme is not constrained by the adiabatic condition and therefore can be implemented quickly. It can also effectively suppress the dominant noise in spin systems, which together with the fast feature guarantees the accuracy of the population transfer. Moreover, the control parameters of the driving Hamiltonian in our scheme are easy to design because they correspond to the curvature and torsion of a three-dimensional visual space curve derived by using geometric formalism for robust quantum control. We test the efficiency of our scheme by numerically simulating the ground-state population transfer in N-15 nitrogen-vacancy centers and comparing our scheme with stimulated Raman transition, stimulated Raman adiabatic passage, and conventional shortcuts to adiabaticity based schemes, three types of schemes popularly used for population transfer. The numerical results clearly show that our scheme is advantageous over these previous ones.

TI In situ detection of RF breakdown on microfabricated surface ion
   traps
SO JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYSICS
AB Microfabricated surface ion traps are a principal component of many ion-based quantum information science platforms. The operational parameters of these devices are pushed to the edge of their physical capabilities as the experiments strive for increasing performance. When the applied radio-frequency (RF) voltage is increased excessively, the devices can experience damaging electric discharge events known as RF breakdown. We introduce two novel techniques for in situ detection of RF breakdown, which we implemented while characterizing the breakdown threshold of surface ion traps produced at Sandia National Laboratories. In these traps, breakdown did not always occur immediately after increasing the RF voltage, but often minutes or even hours later. This result is surprising in the context of the suggested mechanisms for RF breakdown in vacuum. Additionally, the extent of visible damage caused by breakdown events increased with the applied voltage. To minimize the probability for damage when RF power is first applied to a device, our results strongly suggest that the voltage should be ramped up over the course of several hours and monitored for breakdown.

TI Toward high-power terahertz radiation sources based on ultrafast lasers
SO JOURNAL OF MATERIALS CHEMISTRY C
AB The development of new photon sources has propelled scientific and technological breakthroughs across disciplines, ranging from atomic physics and quantum technology to optoelectronics, chemistry, and biomedical devices. This is particularly evident with emerging photon sources of previously unattainable high power, allowing for the clear deconvolution of semiconductor energy states and the elucidation of the dynamics of quasi-particles and molecular vibrations. Terahertz (THz) radiation, once considered a gap in the electromagnetic spectrum, has become readily accessible with advancements in ultrafast optics. While various sources and detectors are available, their output intensity based on typical femtosecond lasers remains still limited to approximately 0.5 mW at 1 THz, constraining their widespread applications. In this review, we explore the main mechanisms and recent advancements in THz radiation generation using nonlinear optics, optoelectronics, and plasma. We summarize their characteristics by examining their performance across different optical configurations. Additionally, we review a novel approach utilizing acoustic waves, initially proposed approximately 15 years ago, but only limited subsequent progress has been made. We delineate the challenges associated with this approach and propose potential solutions, highlighting the significance of further investigation and improvement, which could potentially catalyze a breakthrough in this field.
   A breakthrough to achieve high-power THz sources is needed. This review covers recent advancements in laser-based THz generation, specifically using ultrafast lasers.

TI Conversion from W to Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger states in the
   Rydberg-blockade regime of neutral-atom systems:
   Dynamical-symmetry-based approach
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB We investigate the possibilities for a deterministic conversion between two important types of maximally entangled multiqubit states, namely, W and Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) states, in the Rydberg-blockade regime of a neutral-atom system where each atom is subject to four external laser pulses. Such interconversions between W states and their GHZ counterparts have quite recently been addressed using the method of shortcuts to adiabaticity, more precisely techniques based on Lewis-Riesenfeld invariants [R.-H. Zheng et al., Phys. Rev. A 101, 012345 (2020)]. Motivated in part by this recent work, we revisit the W to GHZ state-conversion problem using a fundamentally different approach, which is based on the dynamical symmetries of the system and a Lie-algebraic parametrization of its permissible evolutions. In contrast to the previously used invariant-based approach, which leads to a state-conversion protocol characterized by strongly time-dependent Rabi frequencies of external lasers, ours can also yield one with time-independent Rabi frequencies. This feature makes our protocol more easily applicable experimentally, with the added advantage that it allows the desired state conversion to be carried out in a significantly shorter time with the same total laser pulse energy used.

TI New Constructions of Existential Unforgeable Aggregate Signature Scheme
   from CSP
SO SECURITY AND COMMUNICATION NETWORKS
AB In future, hundreds of years of mathematical problems that the security of public key cryptography algorithms rely on may be defeated by quantum algorithms. How can a digital signature scheme gracefully balance security and efficiency? This study uses the conjugate search problem and the left self-distributive system to combine and uses the RSA-like algorithm as the underlying structure to propose a new aggregated signature scheme. We, through the EUF game, under the random metaphor model, prove that the security of the scheme satisfies the adaptation unforgeability under selective message attack, the scheme can be finally reduced to the discrete logarithm problem or large prime number decomposition problem. In addition, we can achieve antiquantum attack and exhaustive attack by performing matrix calculations on the message, defining and changing the structure of the matrix by encoding, and setting thresholds for the matrix dimension and the length of the private key. In terms of efficiency, the message signature implementation is linear compared with the expansion rate in terms of storage and computing overhead, and the generation and verification of the final signature pair have nothing to do with the number of users. In addition, the length of the signature is fixed and the size is only the length of a single group, which effectively reduces the generation of public and private key pairs and saves a lot of storage space. The storage space and computational complexity are also effectively improved compared with other solutions.

TI Monolithic integration of one VCSEL on a single mode fiber
SO NANOPHOTONICS
AB The implementation of compact fiber-coupled light sources and devices represents a highly sought through technological goal, in wearable technologies, point-of-care units, telecommunication, and even quantum technology. In particular, a strong reduction of the overall device footprint, still ensuring a compact electrical contacting, would play an important role for electrically driven and electrically controlled devices. Here we show the integration of electrically pumped vertical-cavity surface-emitting lasers on multi-mode and single-mode fibers. The optimized integration technique is enabled by the advanced fiber-to-laser coupling design allowed by a detailed numerical investigation, as well as by an improved technological approach. While for the integration on multimode fibers, an important improvement over state-of-the-art is achieved, the integration on single-mode fiber is here demonstrated for the first time. All experimental results include reproducibility studies to show that the developed technique can be considered for larger scale implementations and are further supported by numerical investigation. This work marks an important step forward in the miniaturization of fiber-based optoelectronics devices which will be highly beneficial for various research and technology developments.

TI Selective band interaction and long-range hopping in a structured
   environment with giant atoms
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Giant atoms, which couple to the environment at multiple discrete points, exhibit various nontrivial phenomena in quantum optics due to their nonlocal couplings. In this study, we propose a one-dimensional cross-stitch ladder lattice featuring both a dispersive band and a flat band. By modulating the relative phase between the coupling points, the giant atom selectively interacts with either band. First, we analyze the scenario where the dispersive and flat bands intersect at two points, and the atomic frequency lies within the band. Unlike the small atom, which simultaneously interacts with both bands, a single giant atom with a controllable phase interacts exclusively with the dispersive or flat band. Second, in the band-gap regime, where two atoms interact through bound-state overlaps manifesting as dipole-dipole interactions, we demonstrate that giant atoms enable deterministic longrange hopping and energy exchange with higher fidelity than small atoms. These findings provide promising applications in quantum information processing, offering enhanced controllability and selectivity for quantum systems and devices.

TI Stress accommodation in nanoscale dolan bridges designed for
   superconducting qubits
SO SUPERCONDUCTIVITY
AB Josephson junctions are the principal circuit element in numerous superconducting quantum information devices and can be readily integrated into large-scale electronics. However, device integration at the wafer scale necessarily depends on having a reliable, high-fidelity, and high-yield fabrication method for creating Josephson junctions. When creating Al/AlOx based superconducting qubits, the standard Josephson junction fabrication method relies on a sub-micron suspended resist bridge, known as a Dolan bridge, which tends to be particularly fragile and can often times fracture during the resist development process, ultimately resulting in device failure. In this work, we demonstrate a unique Josephson junction lithography mask design that incorporates stress-relief channels. Our simulation results show that the addition of stress-relief channels reduces the lateral stress in the Dolan bridge by more than 70% for all the bridge geometries investigated. In practice, our novel mask design significantly increased the survivability of the bridge during device processing, resulting in 100% yield for over 100 Josephson junctions fabricated.

TI Heat transfer in superconducting nanowire single-photon detectors:
   mechanism and modulation
SO SUPERCONDUCTOR SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY
AB Superconducting nanowire single-photon detectors (SNSPDs) have been widely applied in quantum information and deep-space exploration owing to their high detection efficiency, low dark count rate, and wide spectral response. In particular, the heat transfer in SNSPDs largely affects their performance parameters (e.g. quantum efficiency, count rates and recovery time), which can be modulated to optimize the performance and develop novel devices. Considering the potential of SNSPDs and the significance of heat transfer, the most recent progress toward understanding the mechanism and the modulation of heat transfer in SNSPDs is critically reviewed, with particular emphasis on the macroscopic correlation with device performance parameters and the microscopic analysis of existing theories, especially at interfaces. Furthermore, representative novel devices inspired by the need for heat transfer modulation in SNSPDs are discussed in detail. Finally, the development of heat transfer in SNSPDs is placed in perspective with the aim of highlighting future theoretical directions and practical applications.

TI Robust scheme for high-fidelity generation of mesoscopic entangled cat
   state
SO PHYSICA SCRIPTA
AB We here study a hybrid quantum system of one solid-state electronic spin coupled to a mechanical resonator (MR) using the crystal strain, with the purpose of engineering the mesoscopic spin-phonon entangled cat state. The feature of this work to be mentioned is that it proposes a different and feasible method to achieve the entanglement, especially with the higher fidelity. This scheme mainly contains two steps, namely the coherent population trapping (CPT) initialization and large-detuning evolution (LDE). By taking all of the adverse decoherence factors into our considerations, the numerical simulations indicate that its fidelity can reach more than 0.995 (or 0.999) when the spin-mechanical coupling strength is 10 (or 100) times larger than spin dephasing and mechanical resonator dissipation rate, respectively. Because of the cooperation of CPT and LDE, this proposal also exhibits a considerable robustness for engineering the entangled cat state, and which may be considered as a general attempt that may be suitable for different systems.

TI Wavelength-Tunable Narrow-Linewidth Laser Diode Based on Self-Injection
   Locking with a High-Q Lithium Niobate Microring Resonator
SO NANOMATERIALS
AB We demonstrate a narrow linewidth 980 nm laser by self-injection locking of an electrically pumped distributed-feedback (DFB) laser diode to a high quality (Q) factor (>10(5)) lithium niobate (LN) microring resonator. The lithium niobate microring resonator is fabricated by photolithography-assisted chemo-mechanical etching (PLACE) technique, and the Q factor of lithium niobate microring is measured as high as 6.91 x 10(5). The linewidth of the multimode 980 nm laser diode, which is similar to 2 nm measured from its output end, is narrowed down to 35 pm with a single-mode characteristic after coupling with the high-Q LN microring resonator. The output power of the narrow-linewidth microlaser is about 4.27 mW, and the wavelength tuning range reaches 2.57 nm. This work explores a hybrid integrated narrow linewidth 980 nm laser that has potential applications in high-efficient pump laser, optical tweezers, quantum information, as well as chip-based precision spectroscopy and metrology.

TI On a quantum martingale convergence theorem
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF QUANTUM INFORMATION
AB It is well known in quantum information theory that a positive operator-valued measure (POVM) is the most general kind of quantum measurement. Mathematically, a quantum probability is a normalized POVM, namely, a function on certain subsets of a (locally compact and Hausdorff) sample space that satisfies the formal requirements for a probability measure and whose values are positive operators acting on a complex Hilbert space. A quantum random variable is an operator-valued function which is measurable with respect to a quantum probability. In this work, we study quantum random variables and generalize several classical limit results to the quantum setting. We prove a quantum analogue of the Lebesgue-dominated convergence theorem and use it to prove a quantum martingale convergence theorem. This quantum martingale convergence theorem is of particular interest since it exhibits nonclassical behavior; even though the limit of the martingale exists and is unique, it is not explicitly identifiable. However, we provide a partial classification of the limit through a study of the space of all quantum random variables having quantum expectation zero.

TI Wave-particle duality in single-photon entanglement
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICS COMMUNICATIONS
AB Single-photon entanglement, the entanglement between vacuum state and single-photon state, is essentially the entanglement of particle characteristics. Wave-particle duality indicates that wave property and particle property could coexist. Can we find evidence of wave-behavior entanglement in single-photon entanglement? Here, based on the construction of Bell-like inequality in wave space, we propose a method to verify the wave-particle duality in single-photon entanglement. First, we define the wave state in two-dimensional space relative to the photon number state, and propose a method to measure the wave state. The strong violation of Bell's inequality based on the joint measurement of wave states indicates the existence of single-photon entanglement, and the wave is the conjugate variable of the particle. Wave state entanglement obtained from Fourier transform of single photon entanglement and the corresponding measurement protocols will provide us with more information-carrying schemes in the field of quantum information. The difference in the representation in photon-number space and wave space implies the wave-particle duality of single photon entanglement.

TI Robust stimulated Raman shortcut-to-adiabatic passage with
   invariant-based optimal control
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB The stimulated Raman adiabatic passage shows an efficient technique that accurately transfers population between two discrete quantum states with the same parity in three-level quantum systems based on adiabatic evolution. This technique has widely theoretical and experimental applications in many fields of physics, chemistry, and beyond. Here, we present a general approach to robust stimulated Raman shortcut-to-adiabatic passage with invariant-based optimal control. By controlling the dynamical process, we inversely design a family of Hamiltonians with non-divergent Rabi frequencies that can realize fast and accurate population transfer from the first to the third level, while the systematic errors are largely suppressed in general. Furthermore, a detailed trade-off relation between the population of the intermediate state and the amplitudes of Rabi frequencies in the transfer process is illustrated. These results provide an optimal route toward manipulating the evolution of three-level quantum systems in future quantum information processing.

TI Nondispersing Wave Packets in Lattice Floquet Systems
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB We show that in a one-dimensional translationally invariant tight binding chain, nondispersing wave packets can in general be realized as Floquet eigenstates-or linear combinations thereof-using a spatially inhomogeneous drive, which can be as simple as modulation on a single site. The recurrence time of these wave packets (their "round-trip" time) locks in at rational ratios sT/r of the driving period T, where s, r are coprime integers. Wave packets of different s/r can coexist under the same drive, yet travel at different speeds. They retain their spatial compactness either infinitely (s/r = 1) or over a long time (s/r not equal 1). Discrete time translation symmetry is manifestly broken for s not equal 1, reminiscent of integer and fractional Floquet time crystals. We further demonstrate how to reverse engineer a drive protocol to reproduce a target Floquet micromotion, such as the free propagation of a wave packet, as if coming from a strictly linear energy spectrum. The variety of control schemes open up a new avenue for Floquet engineering in quantum information sciences.

TI Renormalization of quantum coherence and quantum phase transition in the
   Ising model
SO PHYSICA A-STATISTICAL MECHANICS AND ITS APPLICATIONS
AB Quantifying quantum coherence of a given system not only plays an important role in quantum information science but also promotes our understanding of some basic problems, such as quantum phase transition. Conventional quantum coherence measures, such as l(1)-norm of coherence and relative entropy of coherence, are widely used to study quantum phase transition. Here we adopt a basis-independent coherence measure that is a quantum version of the Jensen-Shannon divergence to investigate the property of total quantum coherence, as well as its two contributions in quantum critical systems. Based on the quantum renormalization group method, we propose an analysis of the distribution of quantum coherence in the Ising system near the quantum critical point. We directly obtain the tradeoff relation, singular property, and scaling behavior in the Ising system. Furthermore, the monogamy relation is also studied in detail. These results further expand our understanding of quantum coherence as well as to enlarge the applications in using quantum coherence to reflect quantum critical phenomena. (c) 2020 Elsevier B.V.

TI On-chip phased interdigital metamaterials enable versatile manipulation
   of surface acoustic waves, microfluids, and micro/nano-objects
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Surface acoustic waves (SAWs) offer great potential for quantum information processing, optomechanics, acoustofludics, and acoustic tweezers. However, existing SAW chips lack the ability to control SAWs in a manner similar to current metamaterials, which can achieve versatile subwavelength-resolution manipulation of bulk acoustic waves. This study presents on-chip phased interdigital metamaterials (PIMs) featuring customized interdigital electrodes whose geometries are encoded with deep-subwavelength-resolution phase profiles, enabling versatile transformation of SAWs and manipulation of fluids and micro/nano-objects. Our on-chip PIMs can transform forward SAWs into waves with desired wavefronts and energy patterns, such as SAWs propagating in a specified direction, a SAW jet with energy confined in a wavelength, and twin jets. They also enable "diode-like" SAW transmission, allowing for routing the information carried by SAWs along a forward pathway while blocking backward communication. Additionally, SAWs generated by PIMs exhibit unique energy patterns, allowing for versatile active control of fluid streaming and micro/nano-object distributions.

TI Progress in Passive Silicon Photonic Devices: A Review
SO PHOTONICS
AB Silicon photonics has emerged as a critical enabling technology for a diverse range of applications, from high-speed data communication and computing to advanced sensing and quantum information processing. This paper provides a comprehensive review of recent progress in the foundational passive devices that underpin this technological revolution. We survey the state of the art in fundamental building blocks, including strip, rib, and silicon nitride waveguides, with a focus on achieving ultra-low propagation loss. The review details essential components for light coupling and splitting, such as grating couplers, edge couplers, multimode interference couplers, and directional couplers, citing their typical performance metrics. Key wavelength filtering and routing components, including high-Q ring resonators, Mach-Zehnder interferometers, and arrayed waveguide gratings, are analyzed. Furthermore, we provide a comparative overview of the capabilities of major photonic foundries operating on a multi-project wafer model. The paper concludes by discussing persistent challenges in packaging and polarization management, and explores future trends driven by co-packaged optics, inverse design methodologies, and the expansion of silicon photonics into new application domains.

AB The helium compressor system for a miniaturized 4 K J-T cooler has been developed by using a set of commercial compressors. The considered cooler is intended to provide 10 mW of cooling capacity for a superconducting nanowire single photon detector (SNSPD) or for other quantum information devices. The cooler structure consists of an auxiliary 2-stage GM cooler to precool the helium stream and operate the radiation shields; three recuperators; an expansion orifice; and an evaporator. Two commercial miniaturized compressors, originally intended for R134a, have been repurposed for helium. Additionally, a custom oil removal system has been developed to provide a helium flow free of oil mist and other contaminants that may clog the expansion orifice. A model of the thermodynamic cycle was used to obtain the optimal coldhead temperatures. Subsequently, a numerical simulation of the recuperators has been employed to evaluate the required pressures and mass flow rate from the compressor. Lastly, the compressors and the oil removal system have been tested for similar operating conditions.

TI Optical Time-Domain Quantum State Tomography on a Subcycle Scale
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW X
AB Following recent progress in the experimental application of electro-optic sampling to the detection of the quantum fluctuations of the electromagnetic-field ground state and ultrabroadband squeezed states on a subcycle scale, we propose an approach to elevate broadband electro-optic sampling from a spectroscopic method to a full quantum tomography scheme, able to reconstruct a free-space quantum state directly in the time domain. By combining two recently developed methods to theoretically describe quantum electrooptic sampling, we analytically relate the photon-count probability distribution of the electro-optic signal to a transformed phase-space quasiprobability distribution of the sampled quantum state as a function of the time delay between the sampled midinfrared pulsed state and an ultrabroadband near-infrared probe pulse. We catalog and analyze sources of noise and show that in quantum electro-optic sampling with an ultrabroadband probe pulse one can expect to observe thermalization due to entanglement breaking. Mitigation of the thermalization noise enables a tomographic reconstruction of broadband quantum states while granting access to its dynamics on a subcycle scale.

TI Fast generation of high-fidelity mechanical non-Gaussian states via
   additional amplifier and photon subtraction
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Non-Gaussian states (NGSs) with higher-order correlation properties have wide-range applications in quantum information processing. However, the generation of such states with high quality still faces practical challenges. Here, we propose a protocol to faithfully generate two types of mechanical NGSs, i.e., Schrodinger cat states and Fock states, in open optomechanical systems, even when the cooperativity is smaller than one (g(2)/K gamma < 1). In contrast to the usual scheme, a short squeezed field is pumped to rapidly entangle with a mechanical resonator via a beam-splitter-like optomechanical interaction, effectively reducing the mechanical decoherence. Furthermore, by performing an additional amplifier and a following multiphoton subtraction on the entangled optical field, one can selectively obtain the high-fidelity mechanical cat and Fock states. This protocol is robust to various imperfections, allowing it to be implemented with state-of-the-art experimental systems with close to unit fidelity. Moreover, it can be extended to generate a four-component cat state and provide possibilities for future quantum applications of NGSs.

TI Decentralized quantum anonymous veto voting scheme based on
   measurement-device-independence
SO PHYSICA SCRIPTA
AB To remove any trusted third party from the voting scheme, a new primitive quantum secure multiparty exclusive OR protocol based on Measurement-Device-Independence (MDI) is presented by utilizing entanglement swapping of Bell states. Based on this primitive protocol of quantum secure multiparty protocol, a novel quantum anonymous veto voting scheme is constructed, which can meet complete security attributes. Especially, this scheme does not need any third party to count the votes, while all voters can tally the voting results by themselves. At the same time, blockchain is introduced for supervision, so that the voters can verify the validity of the voting content under extreme circumstances. The voting scheme takes Bell states as quantum resources and only performs Bell states identification based on the principle of MDI, so it is feasible to implement this scheme with the present quantum information processing technologies. Finally, the proposed voting scheme is simulated in IBM Qiskit, and the simulation results show that this scheme is correct and feasible.

TI Microwave amplification in a PT-symmetric-like cavity
   magnomechanical system
SO OPTIK
AB We propose a scheme that can generate tunable magnomechanically induced amplification in a double-cavity parity-time-(PT-) symmetric-like magnomechanical system under a strong control and weak probe field. The system consists of a ferromagnetic-material yttrium iron garnet (YIG) sphere placed in a passive microwave cavity which is connected with another active cavity. We reveal that ideally induced amplification of the microwave probe signal may reach the maximum value 106 when cavity-cavity, cavity-magnon and magnomechanical coupling strengths are nonzero simultaneously. Besides, we also find the phenomenon of slow-light propagation. In this case, group speed delay of the light can achieve 35 x 10(-5)s, which can enhance some nonlinear effect. Moreover, due to the relatively flat dispersion curve, the proposal may be applied to sensitive optical switches, which play an important role in storing photons and quantum optical chips.

TI Demonstration of on-chip gigahertz acousto-optic modulation at

SO NANOPHOTONICS
AB Lithium niobate integrated photonics has recently received significant attention because it exploits the attractive properties of lithium niobate on an integrated platform which provides strong optical confinement as well as high photonic integration density. Although many optical functionalities of lithium niobate have been demonstrated on a chip in the telecom band, the visible and near visible regimes are less explored. This is mainly because devices with a relatively smaller feature size are required which increases fabrication difficulty. Here, we explored the acousto-optic effect of lithium niobate on a chip at near-visible wavelengths (765-781 nm) and demonstrated acousto-optic modulation with the modulation frequency up to 2.44 GHz. We adopted an etchless process for the device fabrication and applied the principle of bound states in the continuum to optimize the device performance. By demonstrating functionality at near-visible wavelengths, our devices will enable many on-chip applications ranging from frequency metrology to quantum information processing.

TI Ultra-high extinction ratio polarization beam splitter with extreme
   skin-depth waveguide
SO OPTICS LETTERS
AB In this Letter, we present a high extinction ratio and compact on-chip polarization beam splitter (PBS), based on an extreme skin-depth (eskid) waveguide. Subwavelength-scale gratings form an effectively anisotropic metamaterial cladding and introduce a large birefringence. The anisotropic dielectric perturbation of the metamaterial cladding suppresses the TE polarization extinction via exceptional coupling, while the large birefringence efficiently cross-couples the TM mode, thus reducing the coupling length. We demonstrated the eskid-PBS on a silicon-on-insulator platform and achieved an ultra-high extinction ratio PBS (approximate to 60 dB for TE and approximate to 48 dB for TM) with a compact coupling length (approximate to 14.5 mu m). The insertion loss is also negligible (<0.6 dB). The bandwidth is >80 (30) nm for the TE(TM) extinction ratio >20 dB. Our ultra-high extinction ratio PBS is crucial in implementing efficient polarization diversity circuits, especially where a high degree of polarization distinguishability is necessary, such as photonic quantum information processing.

TI Bulk-edge correspondence in the Haldane phase of the
   bilinear-biquadratic spin-1 Hamiltonian
SO JOURNAL OF STATISTICAL MECHANICS-THEORY AND EXPERIMENT
AB The Haldane phase is the prototype of symmetry protected topological (SPT) phases of spin chain systems. It can be protected by several symmetries having in common the degeneracy of the entanglement spectrum (ES). Here we explore in depth this degeneracy for the spin-1 Affleck-Kennedy-Lieb-Tasaki and bilinear-biquadratic Hamiltonians and show the emergence of a bulk-edge correspondence that relates the low energy properties of the entanglement Hamiltonian of a periodic chain and that of the physical Hamiltonian of an open chain. We find that the ES can be described in terms of two spins-1/2 behaving as the effective spins at the end of the open chain. In the case of non-contiguous partitions, we find that the entanglement Hamiltonian is given by the spin-1/2 Heisenberg Hamiltonian, which suggests a relationship between SPT phases and conformal field theory. We finally investigate the string order parameter and the relation with the bulk-edge correspondence.

However, initial state preparation is commonly either neglected entirely, or assumed to be solved by a simple product state like Hartree-Fock. Even if a nontrivial state is prepared, strong correlations render ground-state overlap inadequate for quality assessment. In this work, we address the initial state preparation problem with an end-to-end algorithm that prepares and quantifies the quality of initial states, accomplishing the latter with a new metric-the energy distribution. To be able to prepare more complicated initial states, we introduce an implementation technique for states in the form of a sum of Slater determinants that exhibits significantly better scaling than all prior approaches. We also propose lowprecision quantum phase estimation (QPE) for further state quality refinement. The complete algorithm is capable of generating high-quality states for energy estimation, and is shown in select cases to lower the overall estimation cost by several orders of magnitude when compared with the best single product state ansatz. More broadly, the energy distribution picture suggests that the goal of QPE should be reinterpreted as generating improvements compared to the energy of the initial state and other classical estimates: such an improvement can still be achieved even if QPE does not project directly onto the ground state. Finally, we show how the energy distribution can help in identifying potential quantum advantage.

TI Tunable Angular Light Emission of Lead Halide Perovskite Nanocrystal
   Thin Films via Solution-Processed Substrate Treatment
SO ACS NANOSCIENCE AU
AB Lead halide perovskite (LHP) nanocrystals have demonstrated a significant electronic response to their local environment due to their ionic lattice nature. Here, we demonstrated their tunable dipole alignment via solution-processed methods. We synthesized LHP nanocubes and nanoplates in air and characterized them by UV-vis spectrophotometry and transmission electron microscopy. Using atomic force microscopy, UV-vis spectrophotometry, and back focal plane fluorescence microscopy, we characterized thin films of nanocubes on untreated glass, nanoroughened glass, and polymer film (poly(methyl methacrylate), PMMA), as well as a perovskite nanocubes-nanoplate binary film on etched glass. Most notably, the dipole orientation factor can be modulated from 0.47 to 0.59 (effective transition dipole moment angle from 47 degrees to 40 degrees) by using glass or PMMA, respectively. Understanding the tunable anisotropic transitions in these materials at the nanoscale is required to control light emission into specific modes, which will maximize efficiency in devices such as light-emitting diodes, photovoltaics, and quantum information technology.

TI Cavity quantum electrodynamics with moiré photonic crystal nanocavity
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Due to the existence of flatbands within the band structure, twisting photonics introduces a possibility to enhance the interaction between excitons in single QDs and cavity photons because of the extremely high quality factor (Q) in theory. In this work, we report a Purcell effect between single QDs and moir & eacute; photonic crystal nanocavities. The moir & eacute; photonic crystal nanocavities in a GaAs slab with QDs embedded are formed by twisting two layer photonic crystal structures with specific angles. High Q, low mode volume and large overlap between QDs and cavity mode field have been achieved by optimizing the filling ratio of the single-layer photonic crystal, with which a Q of fundamental modes about 2000 is experimentally demonstrated. A photoluminescence intensity enhancement of a factor about 8.4 is observed when a single QD is in resonance with a cavity mode, with a Purcell factor of about 3.0 confirmed through the lifetime measurement. This result shows the potential of moir & eacute; photonics to implement solid-state cavity quantum electrodynamics for future optical quantum information processing.

TI A refined method for characterizing afterpulse probability in
   single-photon avalanche diodes
SO APPLIED PHYSICS LETTERS
AB Single-photon avalanche diodes (SPADs) are critical components in low-light-level sensing and photonic quantum information applications. For these, it is often necessary that a full characterization of the SPAD is performed, for which a key metric is the afterpulse probability. This study provides a detailed comparison of the common synchronized and non-synchronized methods used to measure afterpulse probability. Measurements on a single SPAD reveal inconsistencies between the afterpulse probabilities obtained by the two methods. By re-deriving the equations from first principles, the discrepancy is traced to the analysis approach for the non-synchronized experiment. An improved analysis approach is presented, leading to better agreement between the non-synchronized and synchronized methods. The study also provides guidance on the experimental conditions required for the valid application of both methods, along with a detailed analysis of the limitations of the non-synchronized method under high photon flux. These findings offer a more accurate approach for characterizing afterpulse probability and for reconciling the results of two methods, which enables better quantification of SPAD performance.

TI Controllable single-photon transport mediated by a time-modulated
   Jaynes-Cummings model
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICS B-ATOMIC MOLECULAR AND OPTICAL PHYSICS
AB Controllable single-photon scattering in a one-dimensional waveguide coupled to a Jaynes-Cummings structure containing a time-modulated two-level atom interacting with a single-mode cavity is investigated. The photon transmission and reflection amplitudes are calculated by using an effective Floquet Hamiltonian in real space. The results show that the coupling between the atom and the cavity mode can dynamically be tuned via periodically modulating the atomic transition frequency. As a consequence, the scattering behaviors of the waveguide photons can be actively manipulated, and a controllable single-photon switch with high on-off ratio could be realized. More interestingly, the switch works well within a wide frequency region, i.e., the transmission of both resonant and off-resonant waveguide photons can be effectively switched on or off with appropriate system parameters. Furthermore, the proposed dynamically tunable switching scheme is robust against atomic dissipation associated with the help of atom-cavity coupling mismatch. Such single-photon device can be used as an elementary unit for various quantum information processing.

TI Generation of hyperentangled states and two-dimensional quantum walks
   using J or q plates and polarization beam splitters
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB A single photon can be made to entangle simultaneously in its different internal degrees of freedom (DoF)-polarization, orbital angular momentum (OAM), and frequency-as well as in its external DoF-path. Such entanglement in multiple DoF is known as hyperentanglement and provides additional advantage for quantum information processing. We propose a passive optical setup using q plates and polarization beam splitters to hyperentangle an incoming single photon in polarization, OAM, and path DoF. By mapping polarization DoF to a two-dimensional coin state, and path and OAM DoF to two spatial dimensions, x and y, we present a scheme for realization of a two-dimensional discrete-time quantum walk using only polarization beam splitters and q plates ensuing the generation of hyperentangled states. The amount of hyperentanglement generated is quantified by measuring the entanglement negativity between any two DoF. We further show that hyperentanglement generation can be controlled by using an additional coin operation or by replacing the q plate with a J plate.

TI Temperature dependence of divacancy spin coherence in implanted silicon
   carbide
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
AB Spin defects in silicon carbide (SiC) have attracted increasing interest due to their excellent optical and spin properties, which are useful in quantum information processing. In this paper, we systematically investigate the temperature dependence of the spin properties of divacancy defects in implanted 4H-SiC. The zero-field splitting parameter D, the inhomogeneous dephasing time T-2*, the coherence time T-2, and the depolarization time T-1 are extensively explored in a temperature range from 5 to 300 K. Two samples implanted with different nitrogen molecule ion fluences (N-2(+), 1 x 10(14)/cm(2) and 1 x 10(13)/cm(2)) are investigated, whose spin properties are shown to have similar temperature-dependent behaviors. Still, the sample implanted with a lower ion fluence has longer T-2 and T-1. We provide possible theoretical explanations for the observed temperature-dependent dynamics. Our work promotes the understanding of the temperature dependence of spin properties in solid-state systems, which can be helpful for constructing wide temperature-range thermometers based on the mature semiconductor material.

TI Transconductance quantization in a topological Josephson tunnel junction
   circuit
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Superconducting circuits incorporating Josephson tunnel junctions are widely used for fundamental research as well as for applications in fields such as quantum information and magnetometry. The quantum coherent nature of Josephson junctions makes them especially suitable for metrology applications. Josephson junctions suffice to form two sides of the quantum metrology triangle, relating frequency to either voltage or current, but not its base, which directly links voltage to current. We propose a five Josephson tunnel junction circuit in which simultaneous pumping of flux and charge results in quantized transconductance in units 4e(2)/h = 2e/Phi(0), the ratio between the Cooper pair charge and the flux quantum. The Josephson quantized Hall conductance device (JHD) is explained in terms of intertwined Cooper pair pumps driven by the AC Josephson effect. We describe an experimental implementation of the device and discuss the optimal configuration of external parameters and possible sources of error. The JHD has a rich topological structure and demonstrates that Josephson tunnel junctions are universal, capable of interrelating frequency, voltage, and current via fundamental constants.

TI Field-controlled electronic breathing modes and transport in nanoporous
   graphene
SO 2D MATERIALS
AB Nanoporous graphene (NPG) has been previously fabricated by on-surface-self assembly in the form of arrays of similar to 1 nm-wide graphene nanoribbons connected via molecular bridges in a two-dimensional crystal lattice (Moreno et al 2018 Science 360 199). It is predicted that NPG may, despite its molecular structure, work as electron waveguides that display e.g. Talbot wave interference. Here, we theoretically demonstrate how the electronic wave guidance may be controlled by using of electrical fields transverse to the ribbons; at low fields, point-injected currents display spatially periodic patterns along the ribbons, while high fields localize the injected current to single ribbons. This behavior constitutes an electronic version of optical breathing modes of Bloch oscillations, providing a simple mechanism for controlling the current patterns down to the molecular scale. The robustness of the self-repeating patterns under edge disorder demonstrates that the breathing modes of single-ribbon injections offer exciting opportunities for applications in nanoelectronics, molecular sensing, and quantum information processing.

TI Orbital entanglement and the double d-shell effect in binary
   transition metal molecules
SO JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL PHYSICS
AB Accurate modeling of transition metal-containing compounds is of great interest due to their wide-ranging and significant applications. These systems present several challenges from an electronic structure perspective, including significant multi-reference characters and many chemically relevant orbitals. A further complication arises from the so-called double d-shell effect, which is known to cause a myriad of issues in the treatment of first-row transition metals with both single- and multi-reference methods. While this effect has been well documented for several decades, a comprehensive understanding of its consequences and underlying causes is still evolving. Here, we characterize the second d-shell effect by analyzing the information entropy of correlated wavefunctions in a periodic series of 3d and 4d transition metal molecular hydrides and oxides. These quantum information techniques provide unique insight into the nuanced electronic structure of these species and are powerful tools for the study of weak and strong correlations in the transition metal d manifold.

TI Enhanced trapping properties of coupled plasmonic tweezers via
   plasmon-exciton interaction
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB Excited plasmonic nanoantennas enable the manipulation of photons coupled with quantum emitters or the trapping of particles as plasmonic tweezers, leveraging the strong evanescent gradient fields at the nanoscale. However, the ohmic loss of metals presents a significant challenge for the stable and high -precision manipulation of nanoparticles without causing damage. In this study, we investigated the enhanced trapping properties induced by plasmon-exciton interaction for coupled plasmonic tweezers. Through the coupling between plasmons and excitons, dynamic particle trapping is achievable under low excitation power conditions of 0.45 mW, with the trapping stiffness increasing by nearly 20 times. Furthermore, the trapping stiffness can be fine-tuned by modulating the quantity of excitons to regulate the coupling strength. Coupled plasmonic tweezers offer an effective strategy to mitigate the influence of ohmic loss on trapping performance, by manipulating particles with minimal laser power. These findings provide insights into enhancing trapping performance through plasmon-exciton coupling, with potential applications in biomedicine and quantum information science.

TI Generation of heralded vector-polarized single photons in remotely
   controlled topological classes
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW APPLIED
AB We demonstrate an experimental protocol for the preparation and control of heralded single photons in inhomogeneously polarized states, such as vector vortex and full Poincare beam states. A laser beam is shaped by a voltage-controlled spin-to-orbital angular momentum converter q-plate device, which eliminates the need for an interferometer for the robust preparation of high-quality inhomogeneously polarized beams. Such a beam is then used as a pump in a spontaneous parametric down-conversion (SPDC) photonpair source. We demonstrate the full pump to heralded single-photon transfer of the intensity and phase distributions, as well as of the vector polarization structure. Additionally, we show that by controlling the polarization to which the heralding idler photon is projected before detection, we can toggle between the direct and basis-switched pump-single-photon transfer. We show that this nonlocal control of the heralded single photon pertains also to the topological class of the resulting heralded single photon. We believe that our work will lead to opportunities in photon-based quantum information processing science.

TI Zero-threshold correlated-photon laser with a single trapped atom in a
   bimodal cavity
SO PHYSICA SCRIPTA
AB We demonstrate theoretically the feasibility of correlated entangled photon-pair generation with vanishing threshold in a bimodal cavity setup that uses a single V-type three level atom pumped by dual incoherent sources and driven by two coherent fields. The photon-pair is shown to be entangled only for low levels of the incoherent pumps and owes its origin solely to the coherent drives. Our results show that the dual incoherent pumping with no coherent drive can lead to amplification of the cavity fields with strong inter-mode antibunching but no entanglement. We analyse our results in terms of an interplay between coherent and incoherent processes involving cavity-dressed states. Both the inter- and intra-mode Hanbury-Brown-Twiss (HBT) functions exhibit temporal oscillations in the strong-coupling cavity QED regime. Our theoretical scheme for the generation of nonclassical and entangled photon pairs may find interesting applications in quantum metrology and quantum information science.

TI Coherent manipulation of nitrogen-vacancy centers in diamond via
   frequency multiplication
SO AIP ADVANCES
AB Nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamond as ideally individual spin quantum systems can be coherently manipulated by microwave fields. Compared to the traditional method using the IQ (In-phase/Quadrature) mixer with a local oscillator and intermediate-frequency (IF) signals, we report an effective and technically simple method to generate the required microwave field by frequency multiplication and realize coherent manipulation of the NV center's electron spin. After frequency multiplication, the IF signal can be directly converted to the high-frequency microwave field with adjustable pulse width, frequency, phase, and amplitude. A series of spin dynamics applications such as Rabi oscillation, free induction decay, and spin-locking are executed, which verified its performance and feasibility. Frequency multiplication can overcome the problem of clock synchronization between the local oscillator and IF signal and greatly reduce the complexity of the experimental system. The method can be easily used to realize a more complex quantum control sequence such as dynamic decoupling and extended to a wide range of spin-based quantum information applications in the future.

TI Tellurium spectrometer for
   1S0-1P1 transitions in
   strontium and other alkaline-earth atoms
SO REVIEW OF SCIENTIFIC INSTRUMENTS
AB We measure the spectrum of tellurium-130 in the vicinity of the 461 nm S-1(0)-P-1(1) cycling transition in neutral strontium, a popular element for atomic clocks, quantum information, and quantum-degenerate gases. The lack of hyperfine structure in tellurium results in a spectral density of transitions nearly 50 times lower than that available in iodine, making use of tellurium as a laser-frequency reference challenging. By frequency-offset locking two lasers, we generate the large frequency shifts required to span the difference between a tellurium line and the S-1(0)-P-1(1) resonance in strontium or other alkaline-earth atoms. The resulting laser architecture is long-term frequency stable, widely tunable, and optimizes the available laser power. The versatility of the system is demonstrated by using it to quickly switch between any strontium isotope in a magneto-optical trap and by adapting it to spectroscopy on a thermal beam with a different alkaline-earth atom.

TI Dissipation-driven entanglement between two microwave fields in a
   four-mode hybrid cavity optomechanical system
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB The generation and manipulation of highly pure and strongly entangled steady state in a quantum system are vital tasks in the standard continuous-variable teleportation protocol. Especially, the manipulation implemented in integrated devices is even more crucial in practical quantum information applications. Here we propose an effective approach for creating steady-state entanglement between two microwave fields in a four-mode hybrid cavity optomechanical system. The entanglement can be achieved by combining the processes of three beam-splitter interactions and two parametric-amplifier interactions. Due to the dissipation-driven and cavity cooling processes, the entanglement obtained can go far beyond the entanglement limit based on coherent parametric coupling. Moreover, our proposal allows the engineered bath to cool both Bogoliubov modes almost simultaneously. In this way, a highly pure and strongly entangled steady state of two microwave modes is obtained. Our finding may be significant for using the hybrid opto-electro-mechanical system fabricated on chips in various quantum tasks, where the strong and pure entanglement is an important resource.

TI Quantum squeezing of slow-light dark solitons via electromagnetically
   induced transparency
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB We consider the quantum effect of slow-light dark soliton (SLDS) in a cold atomic gas with defocusing Kerr nonlinearity via electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT). We calculate the quantum fluctuations of the SLDS by solving the relevant non-Hermitian eigenvalue problem describing the quantum fluctuations and find that only one zero mode is allowed. This is different from the quantum fluctuations of bright solitons, where two independent zero modes occur. We rigorously prove that the eigenmodes, which consist of continuous modes and the zero mode, are biorthogonal and constitute a complete biorthonormalized basis, useful for the calculation on the quantum fluctuations of the SLDS. We demonstrate that, due to the large Kerr nonlinearity contributed from the EIT effect, a significant quantum squeezing of the SLDS can be realized; the squeezing efficiency can be manipulated by the Kerr nonlinearity and the soliton's amplitude, which can be much higher than that of bright solitons. Our work contributes to efforts for developing quantum nonlinear optics and non-Hermitian physics and for possible applications in quantum information processing and precision measurements.

TI Trends in the hyperfine interactions of magnetic adatoms on thin
   insulating layers
SO NPJ COMPUTATIONAL MATERIALS
AB Nuclear spins are among the potential candidates prospected for quantum information technology. A recent breakthrough enabled to atomically resolve their interaction with the electron spin, the so-called hyperfine interaction, within individual atoms utilizing scanning tunneling microscopy (STM). Intriguingly, this was only realized for a few species put on a two-layers thick MgO. Here, we systematically quantify from first-principles the hyperfine interactions of the whole series of 3d transition adatoms deposited on various thicknesses of MgO, NaF, NaCl, h-BN, and Cu2N films. We identify the adatom-substrate complexes with the largest hyperfine interactions and unveil the main trends and exceptions. We reveal the core mechanisms at play, such as the interplay of the local bonding geometry and the chemical nature of the thin films, which trigger transitions between high- and low-spin states accompanied with subtle internal rearrangements of the magnetic electrons. By providing a general map of hyperfine interactions, our work has immediate implications in future STM investigations aiming at detecting and realizing quantum concepts hinging on nuclear spins.

TI Widening the sharpness modulation region of an entanglement-assisted
   sequential quantum random access code: Theory, experiment, and
   application
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB The sequential quantum random access code (QRAC) allows two or more decoders to obtain a desired message with higher success probability than the best classical bounds by appropriately modulating the measurement sharpness. Here, we propose an entanglement-assisted sequential QRAC protocol which can enable device-independent tasks. By relaxing the equal sharpness and mutually unbiased measurement limits, we widen the sharpness modulation region from a one-dimensional interval to a two-dimensional triangle. Then, we demonstrate our scheme experimentally and get more than 27 standard deviations above the classical bound even when both decoders perform approximately projective measurements. We use the observed success probability to quantify the connection among sequential QRAC, measurement sharpness, measurement biasedness, and measurement incompatibility. Finally, we show that our protocol can be applied to sequential device-independent randomness expansion and our measurement strategy can enhance the success probability of decoding the entire input string. Our results may promote a deeper understanding of the relationship among quantum correlation, quantum measurement, and quantum information processing.

TI A computational approach for investigating Coulomb interaction using
   Wigner-Poisson coupling
SO JOURNAL OF COMPUTATIONAL ELECTRONICS
AB Entangled quantum particles, in which operating on one particle instantaneously influences the state of the entangled particle, are attractive options for carrying quantum information at the nanoscale. However, fully-describing entanglement in traditional time-dependent quantum transport simulation approaches requires significant computational effort, bordering on being prohibitive. Considering electrons, one approach to analyzing their entanglement is through modeling the Coulomb interaction via the Wigner formalism. In this work, we reduce the computational complexity of the time evolution of two interacting electrons by resorting to reasonable approximations. In particular, we replace the Wigner potential of the electron-electron interaction by a local electrostatic field, which is introduced through the spectral decomposition of the potential. It is demonstrated that for some particular configurations of an electron-electron system, the introduced approximations are feasible. Purity, identified as the maximal coherence for a quantum state, is also analyzed and its corresponding analysis demonstrates that the entanglement due to the Coulomb interaction is well accounted for by the introduced local approximation.

TI Unevenly distributed pixel-based camouflage metasurface hiding
   multiwavelength holograms in color printing
SO ADVANCED PHOTONICS
AB Ultracompact metasurfaces have gained a high reputation for manipulating light fields precisely within a subwavelength scale, bringing great development to the fields of nanophotonics, integrated optics, and quantum technology. There is broad interest in expanding the working band of metasurfaces to expand functionalities and the scope of applications. However, increasing the number of working wavelengths multiplexed in a single holographic metasurface is always complicated by two vital issues, i.e., spectral cross talk and the efficiency imbalance between different wavelength channels. Therefore, holographic metasurfaces with multiplexed working wavelengths over three are seldom reported. To address these two issues, we present a design strategy based on unevenly distributed pixels (UEDPs). As a proof of concept, a UEDP-based metasurface is designed to offer a camouflage method to hide four encrypted holographic images in a multicolor printed image. Our results not only demonstrate the idea of UEDP as an easy-to-implement and effective way for strengthening the wavelength multiplexing of metasurfaces but also give rise to a camouflage metasurface by integrating high-capacity and high-security encrypted holographic information with a single printed image. We believe that the generic UEDP-based metasurface design strategy can be readily extended to the realization of artificial functional structures in various disciplines, such as optics, thermology, and acoustics.

SO ADVANCED QUANTUM TECHNOLOGIES
AB Spintronics is a quantum technology which aims at adding the spin quantum degree of freedom to conventional CMOS electronics. Since the discovery of the giant magneto-resistance in 1988, considered as the birth of this field, spintronics continues flooding the market with plethora of devices used in everyday life applications such as hard drive read heads or magnetic random-access memories, and so on. From a fundamental research perspective, the field is still blooming bringing post-CMOS perspectives technologically closer to the reality with, for instance, prototypes of all-spin-logic circuits and neuromorphic chips. To sustain this intense research activity, a quest for new platform materials is also taking place not only to enhance existing performances but also to generate novel functionalities. In this vein, carbon nanostructures such as molecules, graphene, and carbon nanotubes are among the most sought-after materials. In this review, spin transport experiments in carbon nanotubes and graphene are first detailed and then, the necessity to consider new hybrid interfaces are highlighted for a better control of the spin injection at the quantum device level.

TI Diamond with nitrogen: states, control, and applications
SO FUNCTIONAL DIAMOND
AB The burgeoning multi-field applications of diamond concurrently bring up a foremost consideration associated with nitrogen. Ubiquitous nitrogen in both natural and artificial diamond in most cases as disruptive impurity is undesirable for diamond material properties, eg deterioration in electrical performance. However, the feat of this most common element-nitrogen, can change diamond growth evolution, endow diamond fancy colors and even give quantum technology a solid boost. This perspective reviews the understanding and progress of nitrogen in diamond including natural occurring gemstones and their synthetic counterparts formed by high temperature high pressure (HPHT) and chemical vapor deposition (CVD) methods. The review paper covers a variety of topics ranging from the basis of physical state of nitrogen and its related defects as well as the resulting effects in diamond (including nitrogen termination on diamond surface), to precise control of nitrogen incorporation associated with selective post-treatments and finally to the practical utilization. Among the multitudinous potential nitrogen related centers, the nitrogen-vacancy (NV) defects in diamond have attracted particular interest and are still ceaselessly drawing extensive attentions for quantum frontiers advance.

SO ADVANCED FUNCTIONAL MATERIALS
AB The development of high-quality diamond films is pivotal for driving advances in quantum technology, power electronics, and thermal management. The ion implantation and lift-off technique has emerged as a crucial method for fabricating diamond films with controlled thickness and scalable production of large-area diamond wafers. This study advances the understanding of critical interface dynamics during diamond epilayer growth on ion-implanted commercial diamond substrates. Leveraging high-resolution cross-sectional electron microscopy and spectroscopic analyses, the direct transformation of the damaged diamond layer is revealed into a graphitic layer during epilayer overgrowth, eliminating the need for high-temperature annealing. Raman and photoluminescence spectroscopy mappings along the side section highlight the exceptional quality and purity of the epilayer, showcasing nitrogen-vacancy center densities comparable to electronic-grade diamond, making it highly suitable for quantum and electronic applications. Finally, the epilayer detaches efficiently via electrochemical etching, leaving a substrate with low surface roughness that is reusable for multiple growth cycles. These results provide valuable insights into refining the ion implantation and lift-off process, bridging critical gaps in interface evolution, and establishing a foundation for sustainable, high-performance diamond films across diverse technological applications.

TI Manipulating Individual Topological Solitons and Bisolitons in an
   Electronic System
SO ADVANCED MATERIALS
AB While localized topological modes in quantum materials, such as topological solitons and Majorana fermions, promise loss-less delivery of classical and quantum information, manipulating individual topological modes has been highly challenging. The manipulation of Z4 topological solitons is reported in a 1D charge density wave (CDW) insulator of indium atomic wires on a silicon surface. Using the current injection from a scanning tunneling microscopy tip, individual defects-pinned solitons can be created, translated, and annihilated. Moreover, this method is applied to induce bi-soliton processes such as transforming a soliton into a different soliton, fissioning one into two solitons, and fusing and dissociating two solitons, where soliton topological charges are manipulated. The theoretical calculations attribute the mechanism of manipulation to local destabilization of the CDW structure by hole doping. This work demonstrates addressable control over most of the possible operations between individual and paired Z 4 solitons and secures a way to investigating dynamics of quantum solitons and to processing topologically-protected multi-valued information in electronic systems.

TI Multiple-photon bundle emission in the n-photon Jaynes-Cummings model
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB We study the multiple-photon bundle emission in the n-photon Jaynes-Cummings model composed of a two-level system coupled to a single-mode optical field via the n-photon exciting process. Here, the two-level system is strongly driven by a near-resonant monochromatic field, and hence the system can work in the Mollow regime, in which a super-Rabi oscillation between the zero-photon state and the n-photon state can take place under proper resonant conditions. We calculate the photon number populations and the standard equal-time high-order correlation functions, and find that the multiple-photon bundle emission can occur in this system. The multiple-photon bundle emission is also confirmed by investigating the quantum trajectories of the state populations and both the standard and generalized time-delay second-order correlation functions for multiple-photon bundle. Our work paves the way towards the study of multiple-photon quantum coherent devices, with potential application in quantum information sciences and technologies.(c) 2023 Optica Publishing Group under the terms of the Optica Open Access Publishing Agreement

TI Optical-cavity mode squeezing by free electrons
SO NANOPHOTONICS
AB The generation of nonclassical light states bears a paramount importance in quantum optics and is largely relying on the interaction between intense laser pulses and nonlinear media. Recently, electron beams, such as those used in ultrafast electron microscopy to retrieve information from a specimen, have been proposed as a tool to manipulate both bright and dark confined optical excitations, inducing semiclassical states of light that range from coherent to thermal mixtures. Here, we show that the ponderomotive contribution to the electron-cavity interaction, which we argue to be significant for low-energy electrons subject to strongly confined near-fields, can actually create a more general set of optical states, including coherent and squeezed states. The postinteraction electron spectrum further reveals signatures of the nontrivial role played by A (2) terms in the light-matter coupling Hamiltonian, particularly when the cavity is previously excited by either chaotic or coherent illumination. Our work introduces a disruptive approach to the creation of nontrivial quantum cavity states for quantum information and optics applications, while it suggests unexplored possibilities for electron beam shaping.

SO NATURE REVIEWS CHEMISTRY
AB Having served as a playground for fundamental studies on the physics of d and f electrons for almost a century, magnetic molecules are now becoming increasingly important for technological applications, such as magnetic resonance, data storage, spintronics and quantum information. All of these applications require the preservation and control of spins in time, an ability hampered by the interaction with the environment, namely with other spins, conduction electrons, molecular vibrations and electromagnetic fields. Thus, the design of a novel magnetic molecule with tailored properties is a formidable task, which does not only concern its electronic structures but also calls for a deep understanding of the interaction among all the degrees of freedom at play. This Review describes how state-of-the-art ab initio computational methods, combined with data-driven approaches to materials modelling, can be integrated into a fully multiscale strategy capable of defining design rules for magnetic molecules.

TI On the optimality of optical pumping for a closed ?-system with large
   decay rates of the intermediate excited state
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICS A-MATHEMATICAL AND THEORETICAL
AB We use optimal control theory to show that for a closed ?-system where the excited intermediate level decays to the lower levels with a common large rate, the optimal scheme for population transfer between the lower levels is actually optical pumping. In order to obtain this result we exploit the large decay rate to eliminate adiabatically the weakly coupled excited state, then perform a transformation to the basis comprised of the dark and bright states, and finally apply optimal control to this transformed system. Subsequently, we confirm the optimality of the optical pumping scheme for the original closed ?-system using numerical optimal control. We also demonstrate numerically that optical pumping remains optimal when the decay rate to the target state is larger than that to the initial state or the two rates are not very different from each other. The present work is expected to find application in various tasks of quantum information processing, where such systems are encountered.

TI Quantum Interference Effects in Quantum Dot Molecular With Majorana
   Bound States
SO FRONTIERS IN PHYSICS
AB Non-invasive detection of the Majorana bound state (MBSs), a kind of quasiparticle without charge and mass, is one of the core issues in current condensed matter physics. Here we study in theory the quantum interference effect in parallel-coupled double quantum dots which are connected either by Majorana bound states (MBSs) or regular fermions. We find that the zero-energy conductance develops a sharp peak when the dots are connected by the MBSs, whereas that in the case of the dots are coupled via regular fermions shows a valley. By varying the coupling strength between the dots and the electron reservoirs, the conductance in the two structures changes in different ways. By comparing the properties of the linear conductance in the two systems, the information of the MBSs formed at the two ends of a topological superconductor nanowire then can be inferred. We also find that the MBSs in the present structure also induces the Fano effect, and is favorable in quantum information processing.

TI Electrically tunable quantum interference of atomic spins on surfaces
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Controlling quantum interference near avoided energy-level crossings is crucial for fast and reliable coherent manipulation in quantum information processing. However, achieving tunable quantum interference in atomically-precise engineered structures remains challenging. Here, we demonstrate electrical control of quantum interference using atomic spins on an insulating film in a scanning tunneling microscope. Using bias voltages applied across the tunnel junction, we modulate the atomically-confined magnetic interaction between the probe tip and surface atoms with a strong electric field, and drive the spin state rapidly through the energy-level anticrossing. This all-electrical manipulation allows us to achieve Landau-Zener-St & uuml;ckelberg-Majorana (LZSM) interferometry on both single spins and pairs of interacting spins. The LZSM pattern exhibits multiphoton resonances, and its asymmetry suggests that the spin dynamics is influenced by spin-transfer torque of tunneling electrons. Multi-level LZSM spectra measured on coupled spins with tunable interactions show distinct interference patterns depending on their many-body energy landscapes. These results open new avenues for all-electrical quantum manipulation in spin-based quantum processors in the strongly driven regime.

TI Generation of fractional optical vortex arrays via controlling the
   forked photonic lattices in a single spatial light modulator
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB Optical vortices and vortex arrays with spiral-shaped wavefronts and theoretically infinite orbital angular momentum (OAM) have potential applications in high-capacity optical communications and computing, optical micro manipulation and other fields. In this work, generation of vortex-beam arrays is studied by using the forked-photonic lattices in a liquid crystal spatial light modulator (SLM). Via adjusting the holograms of forked-photonic lattices, the input Gaussian beam travels through this lattice, experiences phase superposition and is diffracted into vortex arrays of different OAM. Vortex arrays of the same integer, same fractional and different fractional OAMs along the x and y directions are experimentally generated and analyzed, which shows good additivity in all directions and OAM property during propagation. This work suggests a flexible way for generating fractional optical vortex arrays, and implies application in the fields of optical manipulation, optical communication and quantum information processing.

TI Interplay of quantum resources in nonlocality tests
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Nonlocality, evidenced by the violation of Bell inequalities, not only signifies entanglement but also highlights measurement incompatibility in quantum systems. Utilizing the tilted Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt (CHSH) Bell inequality, our high-efficiency optical setup achieves a loophole-free violation of 2.0132. This result provides a device-independent lower bound on entanglement, quantified as the entanglement of formation at 0.0159. Moreover, by tuning the parameters of the tilted CHSH inequality, we enhance the estimation of measurement incompatibility, which is quantified by an effective overlap of 4.3883 x 10-5. To explore the intricate interplay among nonlocality, entanglement, and measurement incompatibility, we generate mixed states, allowing for flexible modulation of entanglement via fast switching among the four Bell states using Pockels cells, achieving a fidelity above 99.10%. Intriguingly, our results reveal a counterintuitive relationship where increasing incompatibility initially boosts nonlocality but eventually leads to its reduction. Typically, maximal nonlocality does not coincide with maximal incompatibility. This experimental study sheds light on the optimal management of quantum resources for Bell-inequality-based quantum information processing.

TI Anticathode effect on electron kinetics in electron beam generated E x B
   plasma
SO PLASMA SOURCES SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY
AB Electron beam (e-beam) generated plasmas with applied crossed electric and magnetic ( ExB) fields are promising for low damage processing of materials with applications to microelectronics and quantum information systems. In cylindrical e-beam ExB plasmas, radial confinement of electrons and ions is achieved by an axial magnetic field and radial electric field, respectively. To control the axial confinement of electrons, such e-beam generated plasma sources may incorporate a conducting boundary known as an anticathode, which is placed on the axially opposite side of the plasma from the cathode. In this work, it is shown that varying the anticathode voltage bias can control the degree to which the anticathode collects or repels incident electrons, allowing control of warm electron (electron energies in 10-30 eV range) and beam electron population confinement. It is suggested that the effect of the anticathode bias on the formation of these distinct electron populations is also associated with the transition between weak turbulence and strong Langmuir turbulence.

TI Waveguide QED with Quadratic Light-Matter Interactions
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB Quadratic light-matter interactions are nonlinear couplings such that quantum emitters interact with photonic or phononic modes exclusively via the exchange of excitation pairs. Implementable with atomic and solid-state systems, these couplings lead to a plethora of phenomena that have been characterized in the context of cavity QED, where quantum emitters interact with localized bosonic modes. Here, we explore quadratic interactions in a waveguide QED setting, where quantum emitters interact with propagating fields confined in a one-dimensional environment. We develop a general scattering theory under the Markov approximation and discuss paradigmatic examples for spontaneous emission and scattering of biphoton states. Our analytical and semianalytical results unveil fundamental differences with respect to conventional waveguide QED systems, such as the spontaneous emission frequency-entangled photon pairs or the full transparency of the emitter to single-photon inputs. This unlocks new opportunities in quantum information processing with propagating photons. As a striking example, we show that a single quadratically coupled emitter can implement a two-photon logic gate with unit fidelity, circumventing a no-go theorem derived for conventional waveguide-QED interactions.

TI Giant orbital magnetic moments and paramagnetic shift in artificial
   relativistic atoms and molecules
SO NATURE NANOTECHNOLOGY
AB Materials such as graphene and topological insulators host massless Dirac fermions that enable the study of relativistic quantum phenomena. Single quantum dots and coupled quantum dots formed with massless Dirac fermions can be viewed as artificial relativistic atoms and molecules, respectively. Such structures offer a unique testbed to study atomic and molecular physics in the ultrarelativistic regime (particle speed close to the speed of light). Here we use a scanning tunnelling microscope to create and probe single and coupled electrostatically defined graphene quantum dots to unravel the magnetic-field responses of artificial relativistic nanostructures. We observe a giant orbital Zeeman splitting and orbital magnetic moment up to similar to 70 meV T-1 and similar to 600 mu(B) (mu(B), Bohr magneton) in single graphene quantum dots. For coupled graphene quantum dots, Aharonov-Bohm oscillations and a strong Van Vleck paramagnetic shift of similar to 20 meV T-2 are observed. Our findings provide fundamental insights into relativistic quantum dot states, which can be potentially leveraged for use in quantum information science.

TI Extensions of the Mandelstam-Tamm quantum speed limit to systems in
   mixed states
SO NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB The Mandelstam-Tamm quantum speed limit (QSL) puts a bound on how fast a closed system in a pure state can evolve. In this paper, we derive several extensions of this QSL to closed systems in mixed states. We also compare the strengths of these extensions and examine their tightness. The most widely used extension of the Mandelstam-Tamm QSL originates in Uhlmann's energy dispersion estimate. We carefully analyze the underlying geometry of this estimate, an analysis that makes apparent that the Bures metric, or equivalently the quantum Fisher information, will rarely give rise to tight extensions. This observation leads us to address whether there is a tightest general extension of the Mandelstam-Tamm QSL. Using a geometric construction similar to that developed by Uhlmann, we prove that this is indeed the case. In addition, we show that tight evolutions of mixed states are typically generated by time-varying Hamiltonians, which contrasts with the case for systems in pure states.

TI Single-electron emission from degenerate quantum levels
SO PHYSICA E-LOW-DIMENSIONAL SYSTEMS & NANOSTRUCTURES
AB Single-electron sources on-demand are requisite for a promising fully electronic platform for solid-state quantum information processing. Most of the experimentally realized sources use the fact that only one electron can be taken from a singly occupied quantum level. Here I take the next step and discuss emission from orbitally degenerate quantum levels that arise, for example, in quantum dots with a nontrivial ring topology. I show that degeneracy provides additional flexibility for singleand two-electron emission. Indeed, the small AharonovBohm flux, which slightly lifts the degeneracy, is a powerful tool for changing the relative width of the emitted wave packets over a wide range. In addition, in a ring with one lead, electrons emitted from nearly degenerate levels can be substantially separated in time if the driving potential changes at an appropriate rate. In a ring with two leads, electrons can be emitted to different leads if one of the leads has a bound state with Fermi energy at its end.

TI Data transmission by quantum matter wave modulation
SO NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB Classical communication schemes exploiting wave modulation are the basis of our information era. Quantum information techniques with photons enable future secure data transfer in the dawn of decoding quantum computers. Here we demonstrate that also matter waves can be applied for secure data transfer. Our technique allows the transmission of a message by a quantum modulation of coherent electrons in a biprism interferometer. The data is encoded in the superposition state by a Wien filter introducing a longitudinal shift between separated matter wave packets. The transmission receiver is a delay line detector performing a dynamic contrast analysis of the fringe pattern. Our method relies on the Aharonov-Bohm effect but does not shift the phase. It is demonstrated that an eavesdropping attack will terminate the data transfer by disturbing the quantum state and introducing decoherence. Furthermore, we discuss the security limitations of the scheme due to the multi-particle aspect and propose the implementation of a key distribution protocol that can prevent active eavesdropping.

TI A generalized multipath delayed-choice experiment on a large-scale
   quantum nanophotonic chip
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Bohr's complementarity is one central tenet of quantum physics. The paradoxical wave-particle duality of quantum matters and photons has been tested in Young's double-slit (double-path) interferometers. The object exclusively exhibits wave and particle nature, depending measurement apparatus that can be delayed chosen to rule out too-naive interpretations of quantum complementarity. All experiments to date have been implemented in the double-path framework, while it is of fundamental interest to study complementarity in multipath interferometric systems. Here, we demonstrate generalized multipath wave-particle duality in a quantum delayed-choice experiment, implemented by large-scale silicon-integrated multipath interferometers. Single-photon displays sophisticated transitions between wave and particle characters, determined by the choice of quantum-controlled generalized Hadamard operations. We characterise particle-nature by multimode which-path information and wave-nature by multipath coherence of interference, and demonstrate the generalisation of Bohr's multipath duality relation. Our work provides deep insights into multidimensional quantum physics and benchmarks controllability of integrated photonic quantum technology. Wave-particle duality and delayed choice are keys to our understanding of quantum mechanics. Here, leveraging the capabilities of silicon nanophotonics, the authors probe the extension of wave-particle duality from dual-path to multipath case.

TI A Novel Hybrid Quantum-Crypto Standard to Enhance Security and
   Resilience in 6G-Enabled IoT Networks
SO IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE
   SENSING
AB One of the most significant threats that hinder the effective functioning of existing models and technologies in 6G networks, particularly within the realms of Industry 5.0, is the lack of privacy and security. Traditional cryptographic models that were once considered secure have proven to be vulnerable to an expanding range of threats, such as quantum attacks. This vulnerability results in the exposure of sensitive data to unauthorized breaches and compromises the integrity and overall functionality of the network. Access control mechanisms implemented up to this point could not ensure that security compromises are prevented as secure data sharing is facilitated effortlessly. As a result, attempts to access sensitive data without authorization are often made, leaving the networks vulnerable to distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks that have the potential to disrupt their operation. Considering these pervasive challenges, our article proposes an innovative hybrid protocol suite explicitly designed for 6G networks in Industry 5.0. Specifically, our approach integrates leading-edge technologies, such as nth-degree truncated polynomial ring unit encryption with supersingular isogeny Diffie-Hellman (NTRUEncrypt-SIDH) and key-policy attribute-based encryption (KP-ABE). It aims to address the vulnerabilities associated with traditional cryptographic models to ensure high confidentiality and authorized data sharing. Moreover, we implement modern DDoS mitigation techniques, such as rate limiting, traffic filtering, and adaptive routing, to enhance the resilience of the network and ensure that system operation remains uninterrupted. Experimental evaluations demonstrate the superiority of the proposed model over existing standards. Notably, the hybrid protocol achieves encryption and decryption times of 1.8 s and 1.667 s per gigabyte (GB), respectively, with a key generation time of 2.857 s per GB, ensuring efficient performance even in resource-constrained environments. The system achieves a total computational overhead of 11.7 ms for KP-ABE combined with NTRUEncrypt-SIDH, outperforming other cryptographic combinations. In addition, the model exhibits enhanced scalability, flexibility, and security, offering robust defenses against quantum and classical threats while ensuring seamless user policy-based access control. These results underscore the proposed hybrid cryptosystem's potential as a transformative standard for the secure and efficient operation of 6G networks in Industry 5.0.

TI Blockchain Privacy Protection Based on Post Quantum Threshold Algorithm
SO CMC-COMPUTERS MATERIALS & CONTINUA
AB With the rapid increase in demand for data trustworthiness and data security, distributed data storage technology represented by blockchain has received unprecedented attention. These technologies have been suggested for various uses because of their remarkable ability to offer decentralization, high autonomy, full process traceability, and tamper resistance. Blockchain enables the exchange of information and value in an untrusted environment. There has been a significant increase in attention to the confidentiality and privacy preservation of blockchain technology. Ensuring data privacy is a critical concern in cryptography, and one of the most important protocols used to achieve this is the secret-sharing method. By dividing the secret into shares and distributing them among multiple parties, no one can access the secret without the cooperation of the other parties. However, Attackers with quantum computers in the future can execute Grover's and Shor's algorithms on quantum computers that can break or reduce the currently widely used cryptosystems. Furthermore, centralized management of keys increases the risk of key leakage. This paper proposed a post-quantum threshold algorithm to reduce the risk of data privacy leakage in blockchain Systems. This algorithm uses distributed key management technology to reduce the risk of individual node private key leakage and provide post-quantum security. The proposed privacy-preserving cryptographic algorithm provides a postquantum threshold architecture for managing data, which involves defining users and interaction processes within the system. This paper applies a linear secret-sharing solution to partition the private key of the Number Theory Research Unit (NTRU) algorithm into n parts. It constructs a t-n threshold that allows recovery of the plaintext only when more than t nodes participate in decryption. The characteristic of a threshold makes the scheme resistant to collusion attacks from members whose combined credibility is less than the threshold. This mitigates the risk of single-point private key leakage. During the threshold decryption process, the private key information of the nodes will not be leaked. In addition, the fact that the threshold algorithm is founded on the NTRU lattice enables it to withstand quantum attacks, thus enhancing its security. According to the analysis, the proposed scheme provides superior protection compared to currently available methods. This paper provides post -quantum security solutions for data security protection of blockchain, which will enrich the use of blockchain in scenarios with strict requirements for data privacy protection.

TI Energy landscape plummeting in variational quantum eigensolver: Subspace
   optimization, non-iterative corrections, and generator-informed
   initialization for improved quantum efficiency
SO JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL PHYSICS
AB Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) faces significant challenges due to hardware noise and the presence of barren plateaus and local traps in the optimization landscape. To mitigate the detrimental effects of these issues, we introduce a general formalism that optimizes hardware resource utilization and accuracy by projecting VQE optimizations onto a reduced-dimensional subspace, followed by a set of posteriori corrections. Our method partitions the ansatz into a lower dimensional principal subspace and a higher-dimensional auxiliary subspace based on a conjecture of temporal hierarchy present among the parameters during optimization. The adiabatic approximation exploits this hierarchy, restricting optimization to the lower dimensional principal subspace only. This is followed by an efficient higher dimensional auxiliary space reconstruction without the need to perform variational optimization. These reconstructed auxiliary parameters are subsequently included in the cost-function via a set of auxiliary subspace corrections (ASC), leading to a "plummeting effect" in the energy landscape toward a more optimal minimum without utilizing any additional quantum hardware resources. Numerical simulations show that, when integrated with any chemistry-inspired ansatz, our method can provide one to two orders of magnitude better estimation of the minima. In addition, based on the adiabatic approximation, we introduce a novel initialization strategy driven by unitary rotation generators for accelerated convergence of gradient-informed dynamic quantum algorithms. Our method shows heuristic evidence of alleviating the effects of local traps, facilitating convergence toward a more optimal minimum.

TI Adaptive reconfiguration and full control of light structures in optical
   fibers with programmable silicon photonics
SO OPTICA
AB The ability to control light structures in all dimensions is crucial for a wide range of fundamental and advanced photonics applications, including microscopy, imaging, sensing, communications, and quantum information processing. However, existing chip-based solutions cannot achieve simultaneous manipulation of spatial and polarization distributions, and often exhibit limited emission efficiency and beam quality. In this study, we demonstrate a programmable silicon photonic chip that can locally, efficiently, and fully generate and control structured light over both spatial and polarization distributions. High emission efficiency and intensity overlap integrals can be obtained in our experiment. Furthermore, our photonic processor can be actively programmed to invert the unknown random transmission matrix of a few-mode optical fiber and arbitrarily project the input vector into the desired spatial and polarization distributions in real time. Our findings offer a scalable pathway towards achieving a portable and reliable system for full control, efficient emission, and adaptive reconfiguration of light structures across various applications.

TI Intervalence plasmons in boron-doped diamond
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Doped semiconductors can exhibit metallic-like properties ranging from superconductivity to tunable localized surface plasmon resonances. Diamond is a wide-bandgap semiconductor that is rendered electronically active by incorporating a hole dopant, boron. While the effects of boron doping on the electronic band structure of diamond are well-studied, any link between charge carriers and plasmons has never been shown. Here, we report intervalence plasmons in boron-doped diamond, defined as collective electronic excitations between the valence subbands, opened up by the presence of holes. Evidence for these low-energy excitations is provided by valence electron energy loss spectroscopy and near-field infrared spectroscopy. The measured spectra are subsequently reproduced by first-principles calculations based on the contribution of intervalence band transitions to the dielectric function. Our calculations also reveal that the real part of the dielectric function exhibits a crossover characteristic of metallicity. These results suggest a new mechanism for inducing plasmon-like behavior in doped semiconductors, and the possibility of attaining such properties in diamond, a key emerging material for quantum information technologies.

TI Radiation-free and non-Hermitian topology inertial defect states of
   on-chip magnons
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Radiative damping is a strong dissipation source for the quantum emitters hybridized with propagating photons, electrons, or phonons, which is not easily avoidable for on-chip magnonic emitters as well that can radiate via the surface acoustic waves of the substrate. Here we demonstrate in an array of on-chip nanomagnets coupled in a long range via exchanging the surface acoustic waves that a point defect in the array, which can be introduced by the local magnon frequency shift by a local biased magnetic field or the absence of a magnetic wire, strongly localizes the magnons, in contrast to the well spreading Bloch-like collective magnon modes in such an array setting. The radiation of the magnon defect states is exponentially suppressed by the distance of the defect to the array edges. Moreover, this defect state is strikingly inertial to the non-Hermitian topology that localizes all the extended states at one boundary. Such configuration robust magnon defect states towards radiation-free limit may be suitable for high-fidelity magnon quantum information storage in the future on-chip magnonic devices.

TI On-chip spin-orbit locking of quantum emitters in 2D materials for
   chiral emission
SO OPTICA
AB Light carries both spin angular momentum (SAM) and orbital angular momentum (OAM), which can be used as potential degrees of freedom for quantum information processing. Quantum emitters are ideal candidates towards on-chip control and manipulation of the full SAM-OAM state space. Here, we show coupling of a spin-polarized quantum emitter in a monolayer WSe2 with the whispering gallery mode of a Si3N4 ring resonator. The cavity mode carries a transverse SAM of sigma = +/- 1 in the evanescent regions, with the sign depending on the orbital power flow direction of the light. By tailoring the cavity-emitter interaction, we couple the intrinsic spin state of the quantum emitter to the SAM and propagation direction of the cavity mode, which leads to spin-orbit locking and subsequent chiral single-photon emission. Furthermore, by engineering how light is scattered from the WGM, we create a high-order Bessel beam which opens up the possibility to generate optical vortex carrying OAM states.

TI Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen uncertainty limits for bipartite multimode
   states
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Certification and quantification of correlations for multipartite states of quantum systems appear to be a central task in quantum information theory. We give here a unitary quantum-mechanical perspective of both entanglement and Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR) steering of continuous-variable multimode states. This originates in the Heisenberg uncertainty relations for the canonical quadrature operators of the modes. Correlations of two-party (N vs 1)-mode states are examined by using the variances of a pair of suitable EPR-like observables. It turns out that the uncertainty sum of these nonlocal variables is bounded from below by local uncertainties and is strengthened differently for separable states and for each one-way unsteerable state. The analysis of the minimal properly normalized sums of these variances yields necessary conditions of separability and EPR unsteerability of (N vs 1)-mode states in both possible ways of steering. When the states and the performed measurements are Gaussian, then these conditions are precisely the previously known criteria of separability and one-way unsteerability.

TI Non-Markovian noise limits for sustaining entanglement in multiparty
   quantum states
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB The principal resource in several quantum information-processing tasks is entanglement. Building practically useful versions of such tasks, one often needs to consider multipartite systems. And in such scenarios, it is impossible to eliminate the effects of the environment while distributing the resources. We show how information backflow from the environment due to non-Markovianity in the system dynamics affects the resources in multipartite systems, specifically multiparty entanglement. In particular, we find that the entanglement of multiqubit Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger cat states saturates with time to a nonzero value for a non-Markovian dephasing noise. The multiqubit W states saturate to a higher value. Such nonzero time-saturated values are washed out if the non-Markovianity in the channel is removed. The multiqubit W states provide a richer set of features, including a nonzero value for an asymptotic number of qubits and an even-odd dichotomy in the entanglement with the number of qubits. Moving to a non-Markovian depolarizing channel, we find that both cat and W states exhibit a revival of entanglement after the collapse.

TI Magnon and photon blockade in a hybrid antiferromagnet-cavity quantum
   system
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
AB We investigate both magnon and photon blockade for an antiferromagnetic insulator coupled to a linearly polarized cavity mode. We focus on the cross-Kerr nonlinearity between the two magnon modes, which can be large in antiferromagnets with a weak easy-axis magnetic anisotropy. By numerically solving the Lindblad master equations, we demonstrate that the resulting bright and dark modes, i.e., system eigenmodes that couple strongly and weakly to photons, respectively, exhibit distinct behaviors. The bright mode exhibits both magnon and photon blockade due to a weak effective nonlinearity, while the dark mode only exhibits magnon blockade for a detuned cavity photon. The blockade efficiency can further be optimized by appropriately tuning the competing interactions in the system. In addition, we show that applying a DC magnetic field, which lifts the degeneracy of antiferromagnetic chiral magnon eigenmodes, destroys the dark mode and leads to an unconventional photon blockade. These findings provide a pathway for generating single magnon and photon states useful for quantum information technology based on the underlying large squeezing of antiferromagnetic magnons.

TI A Possible Solution to the Black Hole Information Paradox
SO APPLIEDMATH
AB The information paradox suggests that the black hole loses information when it emits radiation. In this way, the spectrum of radiation corresponds to a mixed (non-pure) quantum state even if the internal state generating the black hole is expected to be pure in essence. In this paper we propose an argument solving this paradox by developing an understanding of the process by which spontaneous symmetry breaks when a black hole selects one of the many possible ground states and emits radiation as a consequence of it. Here, the particle operator number is the order parameter. This mechanism explains the connection between the density matrix, corresponding to the pure state describing the black hole state, and the density matrix describing the spectrum of radiation (mixed quantum state). From this perspective, we can recover black hole information from the superposition principle, applied to the different possible order parameters (particle number operators).

TI Control of Quantized Spontaneous Emission from Single GaAs Quantum Dots
   Embedded in Huygens' Metasurfaces
SO NANO LETTERS
AB Advancements in photonic quantum information systems (QIS) have driven the development of high-brightness, on-demand, and indistinguishable semiconductor epitaxial quantum dots (QDs) as single photon sources. Strain-free, monodisperse, and spatially sparse local-droplet-etched (LDE) QDs have recently been demonstrated as a superior alternative to traditional Stranski-Krastanov QDs. However, integration of LDE QDs into nanophotonic architectures with the ability to scale to many interacting QDs is yet to be demonstrated. We present a potential solution by embedding isolated LDE GaAs QDs within an Al0.4Ga0.6As Huygens' metasurface with spectrally overlapping fundamental electric and magnetic dipolar resonances. We demonstrate for the first time a position- and size-independent, 1 order of magnitude increase in the collection efficiency and emission lifetime control for single-photon emission from LDE QDs embedded within the Huygens' metasurfaces. Our results represent a significant step toward leveraging the advantages of LDE QDs within nanophotonic architectures to meet the scalability demands of photonic QIS.

AB Cold trapped ions can be excellent sensors for ultra-precision detection of physical quantities, which strongly depends on the measurement situation at hand. The stylus ion trap, formed by two concentric cylinders over a ground plane, holds the promise of relatively simple structure and larger solid angle for optical access and fluorescence collection in comparison with the conventional ion traps. Here we report our fabrication and characterization of the first stylus ion trap constructed in China, aiming for studying quantum optics and sensing weak electric fields in the future. We have observed the stable confinement of the ion in the trapping potential for more than two hours and measured the heating rate of the trap to be d epsilon/dt = 7.10 +/- 0.13 meV/s by the Doppler recooling method. Our work starts a way to building practical quantum sensors with high efficiency of optical collection and with ultimate goal for contributing to future quantum information technology.

TI Hybrid topological photonic crystals
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Topologically protected photonic edge states offer unprecedented robust propagation of photons that are promising for waveguiding, lasing, and quantum information processing. Here, we report on the discovery of a class of hybrid topological photonic crystals that host simultaneously quantum anomalous Hall and valley Hall phases in different photonic band gaps. The underlying hybrid topology manifests itself in the edge channels as the coexistence of the dual-band chiral edge states and unbalanced valley Hall edge states. We experimentally realize the hybrid topological photonic crystal, unveil its unique topological transitions, and verify its unconventional dual-band gap topological edge states using pump-probe techniques. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the dual-band photonic topological edge channels can serve as frequency-multiplexing devices that function as both beam splitters and combiners. Our study unveils hybrid topological insulators as an exotic topological state of photons as well as a promising route toward future applications in topological photonics.
   Owing to the nonequilibrium nature, photonic topological phenomena can involve multiple band gaps. Here the authors report on the discovery of a class of hybrid topological photonic crystals that host quantum anomalous Hall and valley Hall phases simultaneously.

TI Separability criteria based on a class of symmetric measurements
SO COMMUNICATIONS IN THEORETICAL PHYSICS
AB Highly symmetric quantum measurements, such as mutually unbiased measurements (MUMs) and general symmetric informationally complete positive-operator-valued measures (GSIC-POVMs), play an important role in both foundational and practical aspects of quantum information theory. Recently, a broad class of symmetric measurements were introduced [K Siudzinska, (2022) Phys. Rev. A 105, 042209], which can be viewed as a common generalization of MUMs and GSIC-POVMs. In this work, the role of these symmetric measurements in entanglement detection is studied. More specifically, based on the correlation matrices defined via (informationally complete) symmetric measurements, a separability criterion for arbitrary dimensional bipartite systems is proposed. It is shown that the criterion is stronger than the method provided by Siudzinska, meanwhile, it can unify several popular separability criteria based on MUMs or GSIC-POVMs. Furthermore, using these (informationally complete) symmetric measurements, two efficient criteria are presented to detect the entanglement of tripartite quantum states. The detection power and advantages of these criteria are illustrated through several examples.

TI Silicon photonic microelectromechanical phase shifters for scalable
   programmable photonics
SO OPTICS LETTERS
AB Programmable photonic integrated circuits are emerging as an attractive platform for applications such as quantum information processing and artificial neural networks. However, current programmable circuits are limited in scalability by the lack of low-power and low-loss phase shifters in commercial foundries. Here, we demonstrate a compact phase shifter with low-power photonic microelectromechanical system (MEMS) actuation on a silicon photonics foundry platform (IMEC's iSiPP50G). The device attains (2.9 pi +/- pi) phase shift at 1550 nm, with an insertion loss of (0.33(-0.10)(+0.15)) dB, a V-pi of (10.7(-1.4)(+2.2)) V, and an L-pi of (17.2(-4.3)(+8.8)) mu m. We also measured an actuation bandwidth f(-3 dB) of 1.03 MHz in air. We believe that our demonstration of a low-loss and low-power photonic MEMS phase shifter implemented in silicon photonics foundry compatible technology lifts a main roadblock toward the scale-up of programmable photonic integrated circuits.

TI Controlled multi-photon subtraction with cascaded Rydberg superatoms as
   single-photon absorbers
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB The preparation of light pulses with well-defined quantum properties requires precise control at the individual photon level. Here, we demonstrate exact and controlled multi-photon subtraction from incoming light pulses. We employ a cascaded system of tightly confined cold atom ensembles with strong, collectively enhanced coupling of photons to Rydberg states. The excitation blockade resulting from interactions between Rydberg atoms limits photon absorption to one per ensemble and rapid dephasing of the collective excitation suppresses stimulated re-emission of the photon. We experimentally demonstrate subtraction with up to three absorbers. Furthermore, we present a thorough theoretical analysis of our scheme where we identify weak Raman decay of the long-lived Rydberg state as the main source of infidelity in the subtracted photon number and investigate the performance of the multi-photon subtractor for increasing absorber numbers in the presence of Raman decay. Interaction of photons with Rydberg atoms can be used to modify quantum states of light. Here the authors demonstrate a controlled nonlinear quantum behavior of multi-photon subtraction in a cascaded system based on Rydberg superatoms.

TI Quantum Steering and Fidelity in a Two-Photon System Subjected to
   Symmetric and Asymmetric Phasing Interactions
SO SYMMETRY-BASEL
AB This paper examines the dynamics of quantum steering and fidelity in a two-photon system subjected to dephasing interactions, examining their behavior in Markovian and non-Markovian environments. We consider the case of identical and distinct dephasing rates with experimental parameter values to ensure that the analysis reflects realistic conditions, enhancing its relevance to practical quantum systems. Quantum steering, the ability to remotely influence a quantum state, and fidelity, a measure of initial-state preservation, are investigated for time evolution, initial-state configuration, dephasing parameters, and system characteristics. We model each photon as independently interacting with its environment and derive the time-evolved reduced-density matrix for the bipartite system, focusing on how environmental effects shape the system's behavior. By integrating experimentally feasible parameter values, this work establishes a practical framework for tuning quantum steering and fidelity, providing valuable insights for applications in quantum information processing, such as secure communication and state preservation.

TI Vortex solitons in rotating quasi-phase-matched photonic crystals
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB We present an approach to generate stable vortex solitons (VSs) in rotating quasi- phase-matched photonic crystals with quadratic nonlinearity. The photonic crystal is introduced with a checkerboard structure, which can be realized using available technology. The VSs are constructed as four-peak vortex modes of two types: rhombuses and squares. Control parameters, including the power, rotating frequency, and size of each square cell, affect the distribution and stability range of these VSs. The tightly binding rhombic VSs realize the system's ground state, which features the lowest value of the Hamiltonian. By introducing rotation, stable VSs with topological charges l = +/- 1 and +/- 2 are observed, and the VSs turn from a quadrupole to a vortex-like state. The generation and modulation of stable VSs in rotating quasi-phase-matched photonic crystals demonstrate promising applications in optical communication systems, optical tweezers, and quantum information processing, where precise control over light propagation and vortex states is crucial.

TI Design, Development, and Formative Evaluation of a Hybrid Remote Quantum
   Laboratory Supporting HBCU Partnerships
SO JOURNAL OF FORMATIVE DESIGN IN LEARNING
AB Quantum information science and engineering are expanding and scaling worldwide. As government and industry push to expand quantum applications around the world, education institutions scramble to train the next generation of quantum-aware engineers in the Quantum pipeline. However, as educational institutions seek to expand the pipeline, not all learners have access to Quantum training or equipment. Quantum laboratories, an expensive component of STEM education, often remain exclusively accessible to institutions with affluence and funding, thus creating systemic barriers for underrepresented learners to the Quantum pipeline. This design-based case study describes the three-year design and development of a hybrid remote online Quantum laboratory in partnership with historically black colleges and universities across the US with the goal of expanding access for underrepresented learners to Quantum training. The study describes the prototypical design, development, and formative evaluation of the prototype's iterations and reflects on design decisions made resulting from formative feedback during the design process.

TI Coherent control of light-induced torque on four-level tripod atom
   systems
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB This paper investigates the manipulation of induced torque on a four-level tripod atom system through the interaction with two vortex probe beams featuring spatial inhomogeneity, along with a non-vortex control beam. The study explores both the linear and nonlinear regimes of torque induction. In the linear regime, where the intensity of the vortex beams is weaker than that of the control field, effective control over the induced torque is demonstrated by adjusting parameters such as magnetic field strength, control field intensity, detuning, and dephasing terms between relevant atomic levels. The analysis highlights the significant contribution of the Zeeman shift-induced magnetic field, which enhances the torque and exhibits a distinct sharp peak. Furthermore, higher-order contributions to the induced torque are discussed as the intensity of the probe fields approaches that of the control field, resulting in further enhancement of the induced torque. These findings offer opportunities for precise control over the rotational motion of atoms within the system, with potential applications in precision measurement, quantum information processing, and quantum control.

TI Nonlinear harmonic wave manipulation in nonlinear scattering medium via
   scattering-matrix method
SO ADVANCED PHOTONICS
AB Scattering of waves, e.g., light, due to medium inhomogeneity is ubiquitous in physics and is considered detrimental for many applications. Wavefront shaping technology is a powerful tool to defeat scattering and focus light through inhomogeneous media, which is vital for optical imaging, communication, therapy, etc. Wavefront shaping based on the scattering matrix (SM) is extremely useful in handling dynamic processes in the linear regime. However, the implementation of such a method for controlling light in nonlinear media is still a challenge and has been unexplored until now. We report a method to determine the SM of nonlinear scattering media with second-order nonlinearity. We experimentally demonstrate its feasibility in wavefront control and realize focusing of nonlinear signals through strongly scattering quadratic media. Moreover, we show that statistical properties of this SM still follow the random matrix theory. The scattering-matrix approach of nonlinear scattering medium opens a path toward nonlinear signal recovery, nonlinear imaging, microscopic object tracking, and complex environment quantum information processing.

TI Ultrafast Jahn-Teller Photoswitching in Cobalt Single-Ion Magnets
SO ADVANCED SCIENCE
AB Single-ion magnets (SIMs) constitute the ultimate size limit in the quest for miniaturizing magnetic materials. Several bottlenecks currently hindering breakthroughs in quantum information and communication technologies could be alleviated by new generations of SIMs displaying multifunctionality. Here, ultrafast optical absorption spectroscopy and X-ray emission spectroscopy are employed to track the photoinduced spin-state switching of the prototypical complex [Co(terpy)(2)](2+) (terpy = 2,2 ':6 ',2 ''-terpyridine) in solution phase. The combined measurements and their analysis supported by density functional theory (DFT), time-dependent-DFT (TD-DFT) and multireference quantum chemistry calculations reveal that the complex undergoes a spin-state transition from a tetragonally elongated doublet state to a tetragonally compressed quartet state on the femtosecond timescale, i.e., it sustains ultrafast Jahn-Teller (JT) photoswitching between two different spin multiplicities. Adding new Co-based complexes as possible contenders in the search for JT photoswitching SIMs will greatly widen the possibilities for implementing magnetic multifunctionality and eventually controlling ultrafast magnetization with optical photons.

TI Experimental Observation of Thermalization with Noncommuting Charges
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB Quantum simulators have recently enabled experimental observations of the internal thermalization of quantum many-body systems. Often, the global energy and particle number are conserved and the sys-tem is prepared with a well-defined particle number-in a microcanonical subspace. However, quantum evolution can also conserve quantities, or charges, that fail to commute with each other. Noncommuting charges have recently emerged as a subfield at the intersection of quantum thermodynamics and quantum information. Until now, this subfield has remained theoretical. We initiate the experimental testing of its predictions, with a trapped-ion simulator. We prepare 6-21 spins in an approximate microcanonical sub-space, a generalization of the microcanonical subspace for accommodating noncommuting charges, which cannot necessarily have well-defined nontrivial values simultaneously. We simulate a Heisenberg evolu-tion using laser-induced entangling interactions and collective spin rotations. The noncommuting charges are the three spin components. We find that small subsystems equilibrate to near a recently predicted non-Abelian thermal state. This work bridges quantum many-body simulators to the quantum thermodynamics of noncommuting charges, the predictions of which can now be tested.

TI Identification of orbital angular momentum using atom-based spatial
   self-phase modulation
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB Optical vortex orbital angular momentum modes, namely the twists number of the light does in one wavelength, play a critical role in quantum-information coding, super-resolution imaging, and high-precision optical measurement. Here, we present the identification of the orbital angular momentum modes based on spatial self-phase modulation in rubidium atomic vapor. The refractive index of atomic medium is spatially modulated by the focused vortex laser beam, and the resulted nonlinear phase shift of beam directly related to the orbital angular momentum modes. The output diffraction pattern carries clearly distinguishable tails, whose number and rotation direction correspond to the magnitude and sign of the input beam orbital angular momentum, respectively. Furthermore, the visualization degree of orbital angular momentums identification is adjusted on-demand in the terms of incident power and frequency detuning. These results show that the spatial self-phase modulation of atomic vapor can provide a feasible and effective way to rapidly readout the orbital angular momentum modes of vortex beam.

TI Mirror symmetric on-chip frequency circulation of light
SO NATURE PHOTONICS
AB Researchers demonstrate an integrated mirror-symmetric non-reciprocal device enabled by three coupled photonic resonators. Nearly 40 dB of isolation is achieved at telecommunications wavelengths using 75 mW of radiofrequency power.
   Integrated circulators and isolators are important for developing on-chip optical technologies such as laser cavities, communication systems and quantum information processors. These devices seem to inherently require mirror symmetry breaking to separate backwards from forwards propagation, and thus existing implementations rely on magnetic materials or interactions driven by propagating waves. By contrast to past works, we exhibit a mirror-symmetric non-reciprocal device that comprises three coupled photonic resonators implemented in thin-film lithium niobate. Applying radiofrequency modulation, we drive conversion between the frequency eigenmodes of this system. We measure nearly 40 dB of isolation for approximately 75 mW of radiofrequency power near 1,550 nm. We simultaneously generate non-reciprocal conversion between all of the eigenmodes to demonstrate circulation. Mirror-symmetric circulation simplifies the fabrication and operation of non-reciprocal integrated devices. Finally, we consider applications of such on-chip isolators and circulators, such as full-duplex isolation within a single waveguide.

TI Local manifestations of thickness-dependent topology and edge states in
   the topological magnet MnBi2Te4
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
AB The interplay of nontrivial band topology and magnetism gives rise to a series of exotic quantum phenomena, such as the emergent quantum anomalous Hall (QAH) effect and topological magnetoelectric effect. Many of these quantum phenomena have local manifestations when the global symmetry is broken. Here, we report local signatures of the thickness-dependent topology in intrinsic magnetic topological insulator MnBi2Te4 (MBT), using scanning tunneling microscopy and spectroscopy on molecular beam epitaxy grown MBT thin films. A thickness-dependent band gap is revealed, which we reproduce with theoretical calculations. Our theoretical results indicate a topological quantum phase transition beyond a film thickness of one monolayer, with alternating QAH and axion insulating states for odd and even layers, respectively. At step edges, we observe localized electronic states, in general agreement with axion insulator and QAH edge states, respectively, indicating topological phase transitions across the steps. The demonstration of thickness-dependent topological properties highlights the role of nanoscale control over novel quantum states, reinforcing the necessity of thin film technology in quantum information science applications.

TI Modification of unconventional Hall effect with doping at the
   nonmagnetic site in a two-dimensional van der Waals ferromagnet
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW MATERIALS
AB Two-dimensional (2D) van der Waals (vdW) magnets have garnered considerable attention owing to the existence of magnetic order down to atomic dimensions, flexibility towards interface engineering and unconventional magnetoresistive properties, offering an attractive platform to explore novel phenomena and functionalities, prospective for spintronic or quantum information devices. Among the promising candidates, vdW ferromagnet (FM) Fe3GeTe2 shows an unusual magnetotransport behavior, tunable by doping at the magnetic (Fe) site, and tentatively arising from complicated underlying spin texture configurations. In this work, we explore an alternative route towards manipulation of magnetotransport properties without directly affecting the magnetic site i.e., by doping at the nonmagnetic (Ge) site of Fe-3(Ge, As)Te-2. Interestingly, doping at the non-magnetic (Ge) site results in an unconventional Hall effect whose strength was considerably modified by increasing As concentration, tentatively attributed to underlying emergent electromagnetic behavior, demonstrating an alternate direction towards tailoring of underlying interactions without perturbing the magnetic (Fe) site in 2D vdW magnetic materials.

TI Out-of-time-order correlations and the fine structure of eigenstate
   thermalization
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW E
AB Out-of-time-order correlators (OTOCs) have become established as a tool to characterise quantum information dynamics and thermalization in interacting quantum many-body systems. It was recently argued that the expected exponential growth of the OTOC is connected to the existence of correlations beyond those encoded in the standard Eigenstate Thermalization Hypothesis (ETH). We show explicitly, by an extensive numerical analysis of the statistics of operator matrix elements in conjunction with a detailed study of OTOC dynamics, that the OTOC is indeed a precise tool to explore the fine details of the ETH. In particular, while short-time dynamics is dominated by correlations, the long-time saturation behavior gives clear indications of an operator-dependent energy scale omega(GOE) associated to the emergence of an effective Gaussian random matrix theory.

TI Ice Lithography: Recent Progress Opens a New Frontier of Opportunities
SO ADVANCED FUNCTIONAL MATERIALS
AB Ice lithography (IL) is an emerging and versatile direct write method that complements two photon lithography and focused electron beam induced deposition (FEBID). Based on interaction between energetic electrons and frozen materials, IL permits the creation of high-resolution 2D patterns and intricate 3D micro- and nanostructures. This review highlights advancements spanning the past five years. Several notable breakthroughs have been reported during this time frame including the development of i) new classes of low-toxicity IL materials, including organometallics and renewable materials such as CO2 and ethanol; ii) innovative new substrates such as biological materials and even living micro-organisms; iii) disruptive processes, hardware and digital methods to obtain complex 3D objects; and iv) cutting-edge applications in 2D materials research, direct synthesis of quantum dots for sensing, and ultra-high density data storage. These discoveries offer the opportunity to focus on exciting future applications, and this review peeks into the future through a roadmap on how recent progress in IL might enable innovations into apparent unrelated fields of cancer screening, fundamental biophysics, quantum technology, future microsensor production, and more generally advanced functional materials research.

TI Rapid stochastic spatial light modulator calibration and pixel crosstalk
   optimization
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB Holographic light potentials generated by phase-modulating liquid-crystal spatial light modulators (SLMs) are widely used in quantum technology applications. Accurate calibration of the wavefront and intensity profile of the laser beam at the SLM display is key to the high fidelity of holographic potentials. Here, we present a new calibration technique that is faster than previous methods while maintaining the same level of accuracy. By employing stochastic optimization and random speckle intensity patterns, we calibrate a digital twin that accurately models the experimental setup. This approach allows us to measure the wavefront at the SLM to within lambda /170 in 5 minutes using only 10 SLM phase patterns, a significant speedup over state-of-the-art techniques. Additionally, our digital twin models pixel crosstalk on the liquid-crystal SLM, enabling rapid calibration of model parameters and reducing the error in light potentials by a factor of 5 without losing efficiency. Our fast calibration technique will simplify the implementation of high-fidelity light potentials in, for example, quantum-gas microscopes and neutral-atom tweezer arrays where high-NA objectives and thermal lensing can deform the wavefront significantly. Applications in the field of holographic displays that require high image fidelity will benefit from the novel pixel crosstalk calibration, especially for displays with a large field of view and increased SLM diffraction angles.

TI Visible Brillouin-quadratic microlaser in a high-Q thin-film lithium
   niobate microdisk
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Narrow-linewidth lasers at short/visible wavelengths are crucial for quantum and atomic applications. However, such lasers are often accessible in bulky tabletop systems and remain scarce in on-chip photonic platforms. Here, we report an on-chip visible Brillouin-quadratic microlaser in a 117-mu m-diameter thin-film lithium niobate (TFLN) microdisk via dispersion engineering. Enabled by the ultra-high optical Q factor of 4.0x10(6), high optical mode density, small mode volume, strong photon-phonon interaction and high second-order nonlinearity of the TFLN microdisk, simultaneous generation of Stokes Brillouin lasing (SBL) with 10.17 GHz Brillouin shift and its second harmonic generation (SHG) are demonstrated, exhibiting a low threshold of only 1.81 mW. Further measurement confirms the intrinsic narrow-linewidths of both the SBL ( similar to 254 Hz) and the SHG ( similar to 864 Hz) along with a normalized frequency-double efficiency of 3.61%/mW. This demonstration of an on-chip ultra-narrow linewidth bi-chromatic Brillouin laser paves the way for on-chip quantum information processing and precise metrology.

TI Binding Zinc and Oxo-Vanadium Insulin-Mimetic Complexes to Phosphatase
   Enzymes: Structure, Electronics and Implications
SO MOLECULES
AB We explore the structural and electronic properties of representative insulin-mimetic oxovanadium and zinc complexes as computed in vacuum, in water clusters and upon binding to PTEN and PTP1B phosphatases. Albeit diverse, the enzymes' active sites represent evolutionary variant choices of the same type of biochemistry. Though different in respect to covalency and the orbital nature of bonding, theory predicts comparable ionic radii, bond lengths and square pyramidal coordination for the considered vanadyl and zinc systems when in an aqueous environment. Employing docking, DFT and quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics methods, we address possible polar interactions in the protein environments and compute infrared/Raman modes and optical electronic properties, which may be suitable for the structural analysis of the specific chemical moieties in binding studies. Accounting for how protein embedding may alter the electronic states of metal centres, we discuss artificial intelligence-assisted protein field engineering to assist biomedical and quantum information applications.

TI Collective Spontaneous Emission Modulated by Strong Coupling in
   Hyperbolic Metamaterials
SO PHOTONICS
AB We study the collective spontaneous emission of two quantum emitters (QEs) placed near a semiconductor hyperbolic metamaterial (HMM) composed of a multilayer quantum well (MQW) and doped n+-In0.53Ga0.47As. The spontaneous emissions of two identical QEs in reflection and transmission configurations are both investigated in detail. It is found that the collective spontaneous emission is strongly dependent on whether there is strong coupling in the HMM or not. In the reflection configuration, the spontaneous emission changes more intensively with the transition wavelength of QEs when strong coupling is present compared to the situation without strong coupling. In the transmission configuration, the maximum spontaneous emission decay rate of two QEs can be obtained near the HMM for the given transition wavelength. In addition, the thickness of the HMM also has an important effect on the collective spontaneous emission in the transmission configuration. The results in this work have potential applications in the field of light-emitting devices, lasers, and quantum information processing.

TI Correlated excitonic signatures of individual van der Waals
   NiPS3 antiferromagnet nanoflakes
SO NANOSCALE HORIZONS
AB Composite quasi-particles with emergent functionalities in spintronic and quantum information science can be realized in correlated materials due to entangled charge, spin, orbital, and lattice degrees of freedom. Here we show that by reducing the lateral dimension of correlated antiferromagnet NiPS3 flakes to tens of nanometers and thickness to less than ten nanometers, we can switch-off the bulk spin-orbit entangled exciton in the near-infrared (1.47 eV) and activate visible-range (1.8-2.2 eV) transitions. These ultra-sharp lines (<120 mu eV at 4.2 K) share the spin-correlated nature of the bulk exciton by displaying a strong linear polarization below Neel temperature. Furthermore, exciton photoluminescence lineshape analysis indicates a polaronic character via coupling with at-least 3 phonon modes and a comb-like Stark effect through discretization of charges in each layer. These findings augment the knowledge on the many-body nature of excitonic quasi-particles in correlated antiferromagnets and also establish the nanoscale correlated antiferromagnets as a promising platform for integrated magneto-optic devices.

TI Remarks on 2D quantum cosmology
SO JOURNAL OF COSMOLOGY AND ASTROPARTICLE PHYSICS
AB We consider two-dimensional quantum gravity endowed with a positive cosmological constant and coupled to a conformal field theory of large and positive central charge. We study cosmological properties at the classical and quantum level. We provide a complete ADM analysis of the classical phase space, revealing a family of either bouncing or big bang/crunch type cosmologies. At the quantum level, we solve the Wheeler-DeWitt equation exactly. In the semiclassical limit, we link the Wheeler-DeWitt state space to the classical phase space. Wavefunctionals of the Hartle-Hawking and Vilenkin type are identified, and we uncover a quantum version of the bouncing spacetime. We retrieve the Hartle-Hawking wavefunction from the disk path integral of timelike Liouville theory. To do so, we must select a particular contour in the space of complexified fields. The quantum information content of the big bang cosmology is discussed, and contrasted with the de Sitter horizon entropy as computed by a gravitational path integral over the two-sphere.

TI Optical lineshapes for orbital singlet to doublet transitions in a
   dynamical Jahn-Teller system: The NiV- center in diamond
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
AB We apply density functional theory to investigate interactions between electronic and vibrational states in crystal defects with multimode dynamical Jahn-Teller (JT) systems. Our focus is on transitions between orbital singlet and degenerate orbital doublet characterized by E circle times (e circle plus e circle plus <middle dot> <middle dot> <middle dot> ) JT coupling, which frequently occurs in crystal defects that are investigated for applications in quantum information science. We utilize a recently developed methodology to model the photoluminescence (PL) spectrum of the negatively charged split nickelvacancy center (NiV-) in diamond, where JT-active modes significantly influence electron-phonon interactions. Our results validate the effectiveness of the methodology in accurately reproducing the observed 1.4 eV PL lineshape. The strong agreement between our theoretical predictions and experimental observations reinforces the identification of the 1.4 eV PL center with the NiV- complex. This study highlights the critical role of JT-active modes in affecting optical lineshapes and demonstrates the power of advanced techniques for modeling optical properties in complex systems with multiple JT-active frequencies.

TI Superfluid-Mott-insulator quantum phase transition in a cavity
   optomagnonic system
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB The emerging hybrid cavity optomagnonic system is a very promising quantum information processing platform for its strong or ultrastrong photon-magnon interaction on the scale of micrometers in the experiment. In this paper, the superfluid-Mott-insulator quantum phase transition in a two-dimensional cavity optomagnonic array system has been studied based on this characteristic. The analytical solution of the critical hopping rate is obtained by the mean-field approach, second-order perturbation theory, and Landau second-order phase transition theory. The numerical results show that the increasing coupling strength and the positive detunings of the photon and the magnon favor the coherence and then the stable areas of Mott lobes are compressed correspondingly. Moreover, the analytical results agree with the numerical ones when the total excitation number is lower. Finally, an effective repulsive potential is constructed to exhibit the corresponding mechanism. The results obtained here provide an experimentally feasible scheme for characterizing the quantum phase transitions in a cavity optomagnonic array system, which will offer valuable insight for quantum simulations.

TI Fiber-pigtailing quantum-dot cavity-enhanced light emitting diodes
SO APPLIED PHYSICS LETTERS
AB We report on a process for the fiber-coupling of electrically driven cavity-enhanced quantum dot light emitting devices. The developed technique allows for the direct and permanent coupling of p-i-n-doped quantum dot micropillar cavities to single-mode optical fibers. The coupling process, fully carried out at room temperature, involves a spatial scanning technique, where the fiber facet is positioned relative to a device with a diameter of 2 mu m using the fiber-coupled electroluminescence of the cavity emission as a feedback parameter. Subsequent gluing and UV curing enable a rigid and permanent coupling between micropillar and fiber core. Comparing our experimental results with finite element method simulations indicates a cavity-to-fiber mode-coupling efficiency of similar to 46%. Furthermore, we demonstrate pulsed current injection at a repetition rate exceeding 200MHz as well as low-temperature operation down to 77K of the fiber-coupled micropillar device. The technique presented in this work is an important step in the quest for efficient and practical quantum light sources for applications in quantum information.

TI Conjugated topological interface-states in coupled ring resonators
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB The optical properties of topological photonics have attracted much interest recently because its potential applications for robust unidirectional transmission that are immune to scattering at disorder. However, researches on topological series coupled ring resonators (T-SCRR) have been much less discussed. The existence of topological interface-states (TIS) in the T-SCRR is described for the first time in this article. An approach has been developed to achieve this goal via the band structure of dielectric binary ring resonators and the Zak phase of each bandgap. It is found that an ultra-high-Q with complete transmission is obtained by the conjugated topological series coupled ring resonators due to the excitation of conjugated topological interface-states, which is different from those in conventional TIS. Furthermore, the problem of transmission decreases resulting from high-Q increases in the traditional photonic system is significantly improved by this approach. These findings could pave a novel path for developing advanced high-Q filters, optical sensors, switches, resonators, communications and quantum information processors.

TI Exciton generation and recombination dynamics of quantum dots embedded
   in GaNAsP nanowires
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
AB Semiconductor quantum dots (QDs) acting as single-photon-emitters are potential building blocks for various applications in future quantum information technology. For such applications, a thorough understanding and precise control of charge states and capture/recombination dynamics of the QDs are vital. In this work, we study the dynamics of QDs spontaneously formed in GaNAsP nanowires, belonging to the dilute nitride material system. By using a random population model modified for these highly mismatched materials, we analyze the results from photoluminescence and photon correlation experiments and show a general trend of disparity in positive and negative trion populations and also a strong dependence of the capture/recombination dynamics and QD charge states on its surroundings. Specifically, we show that the presence of hole-trap defects in the proximity to some QDs facilitates formation of negative trions, which also causes a dramatic reduction of the neutral exciton lifetime. These findings underline the importance of proper understanding of the QD capture and recombination processes and demonstrate the possibility to use highly mismatched materials and defects for charge engineering of QDs.

TI Arrays of Si vacancies in 4H-SiC produced by focused Li ion beam
   implantation
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB Point defects in SiC are an attractive platform for quantum information and sensing applications because they provide relatively long spin coherence times, optical spin initialization, and spin-dependent fluorescence readout in a fabrication-friendly semiconductor. The ability to precisely place these defects at the optimal location in a host material with nano-scale accuracy is desirable for integration of these quantum systems with traditional electronic and photonic structures. Here, we demonstrate the precise spatial patterning of arrays of silicon vacancy (VSi) emitters in an epitaxial 4H-SiC (0001) layer through mask-less focused ion beam implantation of Li+. We characterize these arrays with high-resolution scanning confocal fluorescence microscopy on the Si-face, observing sharp emission lines primarily coming from the V1 ' zero-phonon line (ZPL). The implantation dose is varied over 3 orders of magnitude, leading to VSi densities from a few per implantation spot to thousands per spot, with a linear dependence between ZPL emission and implantation dose. Optically-detected magnetic resonance (ODMR) is also performed, confirming the presence of V2 VSi. Our investigation reveals scalable and reproducible defect generation.

TI Probability via Expectation Measures
SO ENTROPY
AB Since the seminal work of Kolmogorov, probability theory has been based on measure theory, where the central components are so-called probability measures, defined as measures with total mass equal to 1. In Kolmogorov's theory, a probability measure is used to model an experiment with a single outcome that will belong to exactly one out of several disjoint sets. In this paper, we present a different basic model where an experiment results in a multiset, i.e., for each of the disjoint sets we obtain the number of observations in the set. This new framework is consistent with Kolmogorov's theory, but the theory focuses on expected values rather than probabilities. We present examples from testing goodness-of-fit, Bayesian statistics, and quantum theory, where the shifted focus gives new insight or better performance. We also provide several new theorems that address some problems related to the change in focus.

TI Dynamical suppression of many-body non-Hermitian skin effect in anyonic
   systems
SO COMMUNICATIONS PHYSICS
AB The non-Hermitian skin effect (NHSE) is a fascinating phenomenon in nonequilibrium systems where eigenstates massively localize at the systems' boundaries, pumping (quasi-)particles loaded in these systems unidirectionally to the boundaries. Its interplay with many-body effects has been widely explored recently, and inter-particle repulsion or Fermi degeneracy pressure have been shown to limit the boundary accumulation induced by the NHSE both in their eigensolutions and dynamics. However, in this work we find that anyonic statistics can even more profoundly affect the NHSE dynamics, suppressing or even reversing the state dynamics against the localizing direction of the NHSE. This phenomenon is found to be more pronounced when more particles are involved. The spreading of quantum information in this system shows even more exotic phenomena, where NHSE affects only the information dynamics for a thermal ensemble, but not that for a single initial state. Our results open up a new avenue on exploring novel non-Hermitian phenomena arisen from the interplay between NHSE and anyonic statistics, and can potentially be demonstrated in ultracold atomic quantum simulators and quantum computers.

TI The information-theoretic foundation of thermodynamic work extraction
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICS COMMUNICATIONS
AB In this paper I demonstrate a novel distinction between work and heat, in terms of the distinguishability of states. Specifically, I show that if it is possible to extract different amounts of work deterministically from a physical system prepared in any one of a set of states, then those states must be distinguishable from one another. This result is formulated independently of scale and of particular dynamical laws; it also provides a novel connection between thermodynamics and information theory, established via the law of conservation of energy. This connection, unlike the well-known one between information and the second law, is exact, i.e., it does not depend on coarse-graining or ensemble approximation. Albeit compatible with these conclusions, existing thermodynamics approaches cannot provide a result of such generality, because they are scale-dependent (relying on ensembles or coarse-graining) or tied to particular dynamical laws. This result provides a foundation for thermodynamics that is both broader and more secure than existing ones, with implications for the theory of von Neumann's universal constructor.

TI Large deviations in weakly interacting fermions: Generating functions as
   Gaussian Berezin integrals and bounds on large Pfaffians
SO REVIEWS IN MATHEMATICAL PHYSICS
AB We prove that the Gartner-Ellis generating function of probability distributions associated with KMS states of weakly interacting fermions on the lattice can be written as the limit of logarithms of Gaussian Berezin integrals. The covariances of the Gaussian integrals are shown to have a uniform Pfaffian bound and to be summable in general cases of interest, including systems that are not translation invariant. The Berezin integral representation can thus be used to obtain convergent expansions of the generating function in terms of powers of its parameter. The derivation and analysis of the expansions of logarithms of Berezin integrals are the subject of the second part of the present work. Such technical results are also useful, for instance, in the context of quantum information theory, in the computation of relative entropy densities associated with fermionic Gibbs states, and in the theory of quantum normal fluctuations for weakly interacting fermion systems.

TI Spatial coherence from Nd3+ quantum emitters mediated by a
   plasmonic chain
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB Controlling the coherence properties of rare earth emitters in solid-state platforms in the absence of an optical cavity is highly desirable for quantum light-matter interfaces and photonic networks. Here, we demonstrate the possibility of generating directional and spatially coherent light from Nd3+ ions coupled to the longitudinal plasmonic mode of a chain of interacting Ag nanoparticles. The effect of the plasmonic chain on the Nd3+ emission is analyzed by Fourier microscopy. The results reveal the presence of an interference pattern in which the Nd3+ emission is enhanced at specific directions, as a distinctive signature of spatial coherence. Numerical simulations corroborate the need of near-field coherent coupling of the emitting ions with the plasmonic chain mode. The work provides fundamental insights for controlling the coherence properties of quantum emitters at room temperature and opens new avenues towards rare earth based nanoscale hybrid devices for quantum information or optical communication in nanocircuits.

TI Anticrossing of A Plasmonic Nanoresonator Mode and A Single Quantum Dot
   at Room Temperature
SO ADVANCED SCIENCE
AB Strong coupling between a single quantum emitter and a resonant plasmonic mode at room temperature is vital for quantum information processing and sensing. Beating dephasing in these systems by ultrafast energy transfer requires coupling single emitters to a plasmonic nanoresonator with ultrasmall mode volume and optimal spectral overlap. Typically, strong coupling is inferred from normal mode splittings in luminescence spectra, offering rough estimates of coupling strength. However, achieving a full anticrossing and characterizing uncoupled components in advance is challenging. Here, the oxygen-dependent blue-shift of CdSe/ZnS quantum dots, recorded at 33 ms time resolution, is leveraged to deterministically tune their transition energy across a scanning plasmonic slit resonator to yield a complete anticrossing, after characterizing both uncoupled states beforehand. The findings provide clear evidence of strong coupling at room temperature, with a Rabi splitting at zero detuning of , consistent with theoretical modeling. This work advances the development of deterministic plexitonic devices utilizing single-photon nonlinearities at ambient conditions.

TI Renormalization view on resonance proliferation between many-body
   localized phases
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
AB Topology andmany-body localization (MBL) have opened new avenues for preserving quantum information at finite energy density. Resonant delocalization plays a crucial role in destabilizing these phenomena. In this paper, we study the statistical properties of many-body resonances in a disordered interacting Ising model-which can host symmetry-protected topological order-using a Clifford circuit encoding of the real-space renormalization group which allows the resonant properties of the wave functions to be efficiently characterized. Our findings show that both the trivial and topologically ordered MBL phases remain stable in the presence of the resonances but, in the vicinity of the transition between them, localization is destabilized by resonance proliferation. Diverging susceptibility towards the development of an avalanche instability suggests an intervening ergodic phase. We are also able to access the local integrals of motion in the MBL phases and identify the topological edge-mode operators in the ordered phase. Our results have important implications for the stability of MBL and phase transitions between distinct MBL phases with and without symmetries.

TI Decoherence of temporal quantum correlation in electrically controllable
   quantum-dots molecules
SO CHINESE OPTICS
AB The decoherence of temporal quantum correlation is explored in a voltage-controlled quantum dots molecule coupled to a cavity. The temporal correlation in the optoelectronic hybrid system is studied based on Leggett-Garg inequalities. The inequality violations can be interpreted as the existence of temporal quantum correlation during dynamical evolution. The temporal quantum correlation is enhanced by its elec-tron tunnel's strength and cavity frequency detuning. It is found that there is no temporal quantum correla-tion in the regions where the values of spatial quantum correlation are zero and the maximal violations occur in conditions with high values of quantum correlation. In contrast, the spatial quantum coherence can still ex -sit when the value of temporal quantum correlation is zero. The method of open quantum system dynamic is used to study the effect of reservoir memory on temporal quantum correlation. The temporal quantum correl-ation can be suppressed due to the spontaneous decay of the quantum dots and cavity leakage. These results are helpful for quantum information processing technology in hybrid quantum systems.

TI One-shot detection limits of time-alignment two-photon illumination
   radar
SO CHINESE PHYSICS B
AB Quantum radar has recently gained increasing importance in a number of military applications. The estimation accuracy of one-shot quantum illumination events is significant in target detection. However, the accuracy is inevitably deteriorated by measurement noises. The traditional one-shot illumination emits a single photon towards a certain area which thermal noise exists in the path to, and the states of the received photons are hard to distinguish in the following processing. Therefore, a new optical probe source is proposed in this work. The independent detecting unit in the enhanced illumination is comprised of two photons aligned in time by using Hong-Ou-Mandel (HOM) interferometer. Further, one-shot detection in a general discrete model is realized and it proves a significant promotion in accuracy. The expansion of useful parts in parameter space and the lower minimal error probability for hypothesis testing have been mathematically demonstrated. The accuracy of one-shot detection can be effectively improved by the proposed scheme implying that it possesses great potential applications in quantum illumination and imaging.

TI Minimum detection efficiency for testing a multi-particle Bell
   inequality
SO NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB Bell's inequality provides a remarkable way to test the consistency between quantum mechanics and classic local realistic theory. However, experimental demonstrations of the loophole-free Bell test are challenging and only recently have been demonstrated with bipartite systems. A central obstacle for the photonic system is that the sampling efficiency, including the collection and detection efficiencies, must be above a certain threshold. We here generalize two-particle Eberhard's inequality to the n-particle systems and derive a Bell-type inequality for multi-particle systems, which significantly relaxes this threshold. Furthermore, an experimental proposal to achieve a multi-partite Bell test without the fair sampling assumption is presented for the case of three particles. For any given value of the sampling efficiency, we give the optimal configurations for actual implementation, the optimal state, the maximum background noise that the system can tolerate, and the lowest fidelity of the quantum state. We believe our work can serve as a recipe for experimentalists planning to violate local realism using a multi-partite quantum state without the sampling loophole.

TI Topological chiral currents in the Gross-Neveu model extension
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
AB We unveil an interesting connection of Lorentz-violating quantum field theories, studied in the context of the standard model extension, and Hubbard-type models of topological crystalline phases. These models can be interpreted as a regularization of the former and, as hereby discussed, explored with current quantum simulators based on ultracold atoms in optical Raman lattices. In particular, we present a complete analysis of the Creutz-Hubbard ladder under a generic magnetic flux, which regularizes a Gross-Neveu model extension and presents a characteristic circulating chiral current whose nonzero value arises from a specific violation of Lorentz invariance. We present a complete phase diagram with trivial insulators, ferromagnetic and antiferro-magnetic phases, and current-carrying topological crystalline phases. These predictions are benchmarked using tools from condensed matter and quantum-information science, showing that self-consistent Hartree-Fock and strong-coupling Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya (D-M) methods capture the essence of the phase diagram in different regimes, which is further explored using extensive numerical simulations based on matrix-product states.

TI Quantum kernels to learn the phases of quantum matter
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Classical machine learning has succeeded in the prediction of both classical and quantum phases of matter. Notably, kernel methods stand out for their ability to provide interpretable results, relating the learning process with the physical order parameter explicitly. Here we exploit quantum kernels instead. They are naturally related to the fidelity, and thus it is possible to interpret the learning process with the help of quantum information tools. In particular, we use a support vector machine (with a quantum kernel) to predict and characterize second-order quantum phase transitions. We explain and understand the process of learning when the fidelity per site (rather than the fidelity) is used. The general theory is tested in the Ising chain in transverse field. We show that for small-sized systems, the algorithm gives accurate results, even when trained away from criticality. Besides, for larger sizes we confirm the success of the technique by extracting the correct critical exponent nu. Finally, we present two algorithms, one based on fidelity and one based on the fidelity per site, to classify the phases of matter in a quantum processor.

TI Difference-frequency generation in an AlGaAs Bragg-reflection waveguide
   using an on-chip electrically-pumped quantum dot laser
SO JOURNAL OF OPTICS
AB Nonlinear frequency conversion is ubiquitous in laser engineering and quantum information technology. A long-standing goal in photonics is to integrate on-chip semiconductor laser sources with nonlinear optical components. Engineering waveguide lasers with spectra that phase-match to nonlinear processes on the same device is a formidable challenge. Here, we demonstrate difference-frequency generation in an AlGaAs Bragg reflection waveguide which incorporates the gain medium for the pump laser in its core. We include quantum dot layers in the waveguide that generate electrically driven laser light at similar to 790 nm, and engineer the structure to facilitate nonlinear processes at this wavelength. We perform difference-frequency generation between 1540 nm and 1630 nm using the on-chip laser, which is enabled by the broad modal phase-matching of the AlGaAs waveguide, and measure normalized conversion efficiencies up to ( 0.64 +/- 0.21 <i )% W-1 cm(-2). Our work demonstrates a pathway towards devices that utilize on-chip active elements and strong optical nonlinearities to enable highly integrated photonic systems-on-chip.

TI Controlling the Surface Roughness of Surface-Electrode Ion Trap Based on
   Micro-Nano Fabrication
SO COATINGS
AB The surface-electrode ion trap is one of the most promising devices to realize large-scale and integrated quantum information processing. However, a series of problems are faced in the micro-nano fabrication of surface-electrode ion traps. A prominent one is the difficulty to control the thick film surface roughness. A rough electrode surface could produce excessive radio frequency (RF) loss and deteriorate trapping ability of the surface-electrode ion trap. In this paper, a thick film micro-nano fabrication technology to control the surface roughness is presented, which can reduce the roughness of thick film surface-electrode down to 6.2 nm, while being controllable between 6.2 nm and 45 nm. Therefore, it can also provide a basis for studying the influence of electrode surface roughness on trap performance. The micro-nano fabrication technology is not only suitable for surface-electrode ion traps with various configurations, but also be further applied to researches of MEMS, solar cells and surface science.

TI A general framework for multimode Gaussian quantum optics and
   photo-detection: Application to Hong-Ou-Mandel interference with
   filtered heralded single photon sources
SO APL PHOTONICS
AB The challenging requirements of large scale quantum information processing using parametric heralded single photon sources involve maximizing the interference visibility while maintaining an acceptable photon generation rate. By developing a general theoretical framework that allows us to include a large number of spatial and spectral modes together with linear and non-linear optical elements, we investigate the combined effects of spectral and photon number impurity on the measured Hong-Ou-Mandel interference visibility of parametric photon sources, considering both threshold and number resolving detectors, together with the effects of spectral filtering. We find that for any degree of spectral impurity, increasing the photon generation rate necessarily decreases the interference visibility, even when using number resolving detection. While tight spectral filtering can be used to enforce spectral purity and increased interference visibility at low powers, we find that the induced photon number impurity results in a decreasing interference visibility and heralding efficiency with pump power, while the maximum generation rate is also reduced.

TI Microwave controlled ground state coherence in an atom-based optical
   amplifier
SO OSA CONTINUUM
AB We experimentally investigate and theoretically analyze the effect of microwave controlled atomic ground state coherence on the phase-dependent amplification (PDA) of an optical probe field. We use three hyperfine levels in room temperature Rb-85 atoms, which are cyclically connected by two optical and one microwave electromagnetic field. We show that a simultaneous fulfilment of a two-photon resonance condition that creates ground state coherence and a three-photon resonance condition leads to a significantly higher amplification of 7.5 dB of the optical probe field with a visibility of 98.8 %. By selectively breaking the ground state coherence using microwaves, we show that the amplification reduces with a bandwidth of 5 MHz. Nevertheless, the system shows non-zero PDA for large two-photon detunings of 15 MHz with high visibility of 66.8 %. This novel, controllable hybrid-PDA can be potentially used to trade-off amplification for bandwidth during the transmission of phase coherent classical and quantum information.

TI Mechanical overtone frequency combs
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Mechanical frequency combs are poised to bring the applications and utility of optical frequency combs into the mechanical domain. So far, their main challenge has been strict requirements on drive frequencies and power, which complicate operation. We demonstrate a straightforward mechanism to create a frequency comb consisting of mechanical overtones (integer multiples) of a single eigenfrequency, by monolithically integrating a suspended dielectric membrane with a counter-propagating optical trap. The periodic optical field modulates the dielectrophoretic force on the membrane at the overtones of a membrane's motion. These overtones share a fixed frequency and phase relation, and constitute a mechanical frequency comb. The periodic optical field also creates an optothermal parametric drive that requires no additional power or external frequency reference. This combination of effects results in an easy-to-use mechanical frequency comb platform that requires no precise alignment, no additional feedback or control electronics, and only uses a single, mW continuous wave laser beam. This highlights the overtone frequency comb as the straightforward future for applications in sensing, metrology and quantum acoustics.
   The authors combined optical traps and frequency combs to create new acoustic technology - a mechanical frequency comb. The generation of this comb does not require any precision control, making it uniquely positioned for sensing, metrology, and quantum technology.

TI First-principles study of the T center in silicon
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW MATERIALS
AB The T center in silicon is a well-known carbon-based color center that has been recently considered for quantum technology applications. Using first-principles computations, we show that the excited state is formed by a defect-bound exciton made of a localized defect state occupied by an electron to which a hole is bound. The localized state is of strong carbon p character and reminiscent of the localization of the unpaired electron in the ethyl radical molecule. The radiative lifetime for the defect-bound exciton is calculated to be on the order of microseconds, much longer than for other quantum defects such as the nitrogen vacancy center in diamond and in agreement with experiments. The longer lifetime is associated with the small transition dipole moment as a result of the very different nature of the localized and delocalized states forming the defect-bound exciton. Finally, we use first-principles calculations to assess the stability of the T center. We find the T center to be stable against decomposition into simpler defects when keeping the stoichiometry fixed. However, we identify that the T center is easily prone to (de)hydrogenation and so requires very precise annealing conditions (temperature and atmosphere) to be efficiently formed.

TI Scalable and fault-tolerant preparation of encoded k-uniform
   states
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB k-uniform states are valuable resources in quantum information, enabling tasks such as teleportation, error correction, and accelerated quantum simulations. However, the practical realization of k-uniform states, at scale, faces major obstacles: Verifying k uniformity is as difficult as measuring code distances, and devising fault-tolerant logical preparation protocols further adds to the complexity. To address these challenges, we present a scalable fault-tolerant method for preparing encoded k-uniform states and we illustrate our approach using surface and color codes. We first present a technique to determine k uniformity of stabilizer states directly from their stabilizer tableau. We then identify a family of Clifford circuits that ensures both fault tolerance and scalability in preparing these states. Building on the encoded k-uniform states, we introduce a hybrid physical-logical strategy that retains some of the error-protection benefits of logical qubits while lowering the overhead for implementing arbitrary gates compared to fully logical algorithms. We show that this hybrid approach can outperform fully physical implementations for resource-state preparation, as demonstrated by explicit constructions of k-uniform states.

TI Multiwavelength, Ultranarrow Line Width Emission from
   Fiber-Capillary-Integrated Colloidal Quantum Well Lasers
SO ACS NANO
AB Multiwavelength laser sources are indispensable in the development of quantum information, laser lighting, and laser display technologies. However, conventional multiwavelength lasers are costly, cumbersome, and intricate, limiting their adaptability across various applications. To overcome these challenges, we propose an integrated multiwavelength laser source based on solution-processed colloidal quantum wells (CQWs). Through precise control over size, elemental doping, and the design of heterostructures, we have engineered CQWs that exhibit ultralow stimulated emission thresholds across red, orange, yellow, and green wavelengths. CQW-based multiwavelength laser source delivers single-mode lasing with narrow line widths below 50 pm. Importantly, the laser structure is optimized via optical fiber coupling strategies, eliminating the need for complex micromanipulation procedures. Furthermore, we provide a preliminary demonstration of the applications of CQW-optical fiber lasers in automobile exhaust sensing, confirming their great promise for further development. These impressive specifications for colloidal semiconductor lasers highlight their strong potential as a powerful platform for next-generation visible light laser technologies.

TI Roadmap for Quantum Nanophotonics with Free Electrons
SO ACS PHOTONICS
AB Over the past century, continuous advancements in electron microscopy have enabled the synthesis, control, and characterization of high-quality free-electron beams. These probes carry an evanescent electromagnetic field that can drive localized excitations and provide high-resolution information on material structures and their optical responses, currently reaching the sub-& Aring; and few-meV regime. Moreover, combining free electrons with pulsed light sources in ultrafast electron microscopy adds temporal resolution in the subfemtosecond range while offering enhanced control of the electron wave function. Beyond their exceptional capabilities for time-resolved spectromicroscopy, free electrons are emerging as powerful tools in quantum nanophotonics, on par with photons in their ability to carry and transfer quantum information, create entanglement within and with a specimen, and reveal previously inaccessible details on nanoscale quantum phenomena. This Roadmap outlines the current state of this rapidly evolving field, highlights key challenges and opportunities, and discusses future directions through a collection of topical sections prepared by leading experts.

TI An ambipolar single-charge pump in silicon
SO APPLIED PHYSICS LETTERS
AB The mechanism of single-charge pumping using a dynamic quantum dot needs to be precisely understood for high-accuracy and universal operation toward applications to quantum current standards and quantum information devices. The type of charge carrier (electron or hole) is an important factor for determining the pumping accuracy, but it has been so far compared just using different devices that could have different potential landscapes. Here, we report measurements of a silicon ambipolar single-charge pump. It allows a comparison between the single-electron and single-hole pumps that share the entrance tunnel barrier, which is a critical part of the pumping operation. By changing the frequency and temperature, we reveal that the entrance barrier has a better energy selectivity in the single-hole pumping, leading to a pumping error rate better than that in the single-electron pumping up to 400 MHz. This result implies that the heavy effective mass of holes is related to the superior characteristics in the single-hole pumping, which would be an important finding for stably realizing accurate single-charge pumping operation.

TI Developing improved measures of non-Gaussianity and Gaussianity for
   quantum states based on normalized Hilbert-Schmidt distance
SO CHINESE PHYSICS B
AB Non-Gaussianity of quantum states is a very important source for quantum information technology and can be quantified by using the known squared Hilbert-Schmidt distance recently introduced by Genoni et al. (Phys. Rev. A 78 042327 (2007)). It is, however, shown that such a measure has many imperfects such as the lack of the swapping symmetry and the ineffectiveness evaluation of even Schrodinger-cat-like states with small amplitudes. To deal with these difficulties, we propose an improved measure of non-Gaussianity for quantum states and discuss its properties in detail. We then exploit this improved measure to evaluate the non-Gaussianities of some relevant single-mode non-Gaussian states and multi-mode non-Gaussian entangled states. These results show that our measure is reliable. We also introduce a modified measure for Gaussianity following Mandilara and Cerf (Phys. Rev. A 86 030102(R) (2012)) and establish a conservation relation of non-Gaussianity and Gaussianity of a quantum state.

TI Classical and quantum compression for edge computing: the ubiquitous
   data dimensionality reduction
SO COMPUTING
AB Edge computing aims to address the challenges associated with communicating and transferring large amounts of data generated remotely to a data center in a timely and efficient manner. A central pillar of edge computing is local (i.e., at- or near-source) data processing capability so that data transfer to a data center for processing can be minimized. Data compression at the edge is therefore a natural component of edge workflows. We present a survey of data compression algorithms with a focus on edge computing. Not all compression algorithms can accommodate the data type heterogeneity, tight processing and communication time constraints, or energy efficiency requirement characteristics of edge computing. We discuss specific examples of compression algorithms that are being explored in the context of edge computing. We end our review with a brief survey of emerging quantum compression techniques that are of importance in quantum information processing, including the proposed concept of quantum edge computing.

TI Squeezed States of Light for Future Gravitational Wave Detectors at a
   Wavelength of 1550 nm
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB The generation of strongly squeezed vacuum states of light is a key technology for future ground-based gravitational wave detectors (GWDs) to reach sensitivities beyond their quantum noise limit. For some proposed observatory designs, an operating laser wavelength of 1550 nm or around 2 mu m is required to enable the use of cryogenically cooled silicon test masses for thermal noise reduction. Here, we present for the first time the direct measurement of up to 11.5 dB squeezing at 1550 nm over the complete detection bandwidth of future ground-based GWDs ranging from 10 kHz down to below 1 Hz. Furthermore, we directly observe a quantum shot-noise reduction of up to (13.5 +/- 0.1) dB at megahertz frequencies. This allows us to derive a precise constraint on the absolute quantum efficiency of the photodiode used for balanced homodyne detection. These results hold important insight regarding the quantum noise reduction efficiency in future GWDs, as well as for quantum information and cryptography, where low decoherence of nonclassical states of light is also of high relevance.

TI Spin-enabled photochemistry using nanocrystal-molecule hybrids
SO CHEM
AB Research interest in the spin properties of lead halide perovskites has been rising in recent years in the hope of using solution-processed materials for scalable implementation of spintronics and quantum information technologies. However, very short spin lifetimes are often found for these systems, suggesting a long way to go along this direction. Here, we propose that these short spin lifetimes can instead find immediate applications in molecular photochemistry that largely relies on spin-relaxed triplet excited states. We demonstrated this using CsPbBr3 nanocrystals interfaced with rhodamine B (RhB) molecules. Photoexcitation of RhB led to hole injection into nanocrystals; rapid hole spin-flip and subsequent recombination of the charge-separated states efficiently populated RhB triplets. Photoexcitation of CsPbBr3 nanocrystals also produced RhB triplets through a similar mechanism. Because of the complementary spectral coverage of CsPbBr3 and RhB, we achieved efficient white-light-driven triplet-fusion photon upconversion and singlet-oxygen generation using triplets from the nanocrystal-molecule hybrids.

TI Hamiltonian-driven shadow tomography of quantum states
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Classical shadow tomography provides an efficient method for predicting functions of an unknown quantum state from a few measurements of the state. It relies on a unitary channel that efficiently scrambles the quantum information of the state to the measurement basis. Facing the challenge of realizing deep unitary circuits on near-term quantum devices, we explore the scenario in which the unitary channel can be shallow and is generated by a quantum chaotic Hamiltonian via time evolution. We provide an unbiased estimator of the density matrix for all ranges of the evolution time. We analyze the sample complexity of the Hamiltonian-driven shadow tomography. For Pauli observables, we find that it can be more efficient than the unitary-2-design-based shadow tomography in a sequence of intermediate time windows that range from an order-1 scrambling time to a timescale of D-1/6, given the Hilbert space dimension D. In particular, the efficiency of predicting diagonal Pauli observables is improved by a factor of D without sacrificing the efficiency of predicting off-diagonal Pauli observables.

TI Experimental test of the Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger-type paradoxes in
   and beyond graph states
SO NPJ QUANTUM INFORMATION
AB The Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) paradox is an exquisite no-go theorem that shows the sharp contradiction between classical theory and quantum mechanics by ruling out any local realistic description of quantum theory. The investigation of GHZ-type paradoxes has been carried out in a variety of systems and led to fruitful discoveries. However, its range of applicability still remains unknown and a unified construction is yet to be discovered. In this work, we present a unified construction of GHZ-type paradoxes for graph states, and show that the existence of GHZ-type paradox is not limited to graph states. The results have important applications in quantum state verification for graph states, entanglement detection, and construction of GHZ-type steering paradox for mixed states. We perform a photonic experiment to test the GHZ-type paradoxes via measuring the success probability of their corresponding perfect Hardy-type paradoxes, and demonstrate the proposed applications. Our work deepens the comprehension of quantum paradoxes in quantum foundations, and may have applications in a broad spectrum of quantum information tasks.

TI Entanglement-assisted phase-estimation algorithm for calculating
   dynamical response functions
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Dynamical response functions are fundamental quantities to describe the excited-state properties in quantum many-body systems. Quantum algorithms have been proposed to evaluate these quantities by means of quantum phase estimation (QPE), where the energy spectra are directly extracted from the QPE measurement outcomes in the frequency domain. Accurate estimation of excitation energies and transition probabilities with these QPE-based approaches is, however, challenging because of the problem of spectral leakage (or peak broadening) which is inherent in the QPE algorithm. To overcome this issue, in this work we consider an extension of the QPE-based approach adopting the optimal entangled input states, which is known to achieve the Heisenberg-limited scaling for the estimation precision. We show that with this method the peaks in the calculated energy spectra are more localized than those calculated by the original QPE-based approaches, suggesting the mitigation of the spectral leakage problem. By analyzing the probability distribution with the entangled phase estimation, we propose a simple scheme to better estimate both the transition energies and the corresponding transition probabilities of the peaks of interest in the spectra. The validity of our prescription is demonstrated by numerical simulations in various quantum many-body problems: the spectral function of a simple electron-plasmon model in condensed-matter physics, the dipole transitions of the H2O 2 O molecule in quantum chemistry, and the electromagnetic transitions of the 6 Li nucleus in nuclear physics.

AB We revisit the so-called compressed oracle technique, introduced by Zhandry for analyzing quantum algorithms in the quantum random oracle model (QROM). To start off with, we offer a concise exposition of the technique, which easily extends to the parallel-query QROM, where in each query-round the considered algorithm may make several queries to the QROM in parallel. This variant of the QROM allows for a more fine-grained query-complexity analysis.
   Our main technical contribution is a framework that simplifies the use of (the parallel-query generalization of) the compressed oracle technique for proving query complexity results. With our framework in place, whenever applicable, it is possible to prove quantum query complexity lower bounds by means of purely classical reasoning. More than that, for typical examples the crucial classical observations that give rise to the classical bounds are sufficient to conclude the corresponding quantum bounds.
   We demonstrate this on a few examples, recovering known results but also obtaining new results. Our main target is the hardness of finding a q-chain with fewer than q parallel queries, i.e., a sequence x(0), x(1), ... , x(q) with x(i) = H(x(i-1)) for all 1 <= i <= q.
   The above problem of finding a hash chain is of fundamental importance in the context of proofs of sequential work. Indeed, as a concrete cryptographic application of our techniques, we prove quantum security of the "Simple Proofs of Sequential Work" by Cohen and Pietrzak.

AB The Learning With Errors (LWE) problem asks to find s from an input of the form (A, b = As+e) epsilon (Z/qZ)(m x n) x (Z/qZ)(m), for a vector e that has small-magnitude entries. In this work, we do not focus on solving LWE but on the task of sampling instances. As these are extremely sparse in their range, it may seem plausible that the only way to proceed is to first create s and e and then set b = As+e. In particular, such an instance sampler knows the solution. This raises the question whether it is possible to obliviously sample (A, As+e), namely, without knowing the underlying s. A variant of the assumption that oblivious LWE sampling is hard has been used in a series of works to analyze the security of candidate constructions of Succinct Non-interactive Arguments of Knowledge (SNARKs). As the assumption is related to LWE, these SNARKs have been conjectured to be secure in the presence of quantum adversaries.
   Our main result is a quantum polynomial-time algorithm that samples well-distributed LWE instances while provably not knowing the solution, under the assumption that LWE is hard. Moreover, the approach works for a vast range of LWE parametrizations, including those used in the above-mentioned SNARKs. This invalidates the assumptions used in their security analyses, although it does not yield attacks against the constructions themselves.

TI Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen Experiment with Two Bose-Einstein Condensates
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW X
AB In 1935, Einstein, Podolsky, and Rosen (EPR) conceived a gedanken experiment which became a cornerstone of quantum technology and still challenges our understanding of reality and locality today. While the experiment has been realized with small quantum systems, a demonstration of the EPR paradox with massive many-particle systems remains an important challenge, as such systems are particularly closely tied to the concept of local realism in our everyday experience and may serve as probes for new physics at the quantum-to-classical transition. In this work we report an EPR experiment with two spatially separated Bose-Einstein condensates, each containing about 700 rubidium atoms. Entanglement between the condensates results in strong correlations of their collective spins, allowing us to demonstrate the EPR paradox between them. Our results represent the first observation of the EPR paradox with spatially separated, massive many-particle systems. They show that the conflict between quantum mechanics and local realism does not disappear as the system size increases to more than a thousand massive particles. Furthermore, EPR entanglement in conjunction with individual manipulation of the two condensates on the quantum level, as we demonstrate here, constitutes an important resource for quantum metrology and information processing with many-particle systems.

TI Structural and optical characterization of nanometer sized
   MoS2/graphene heterostructures for potential use in
   optoelectronic devices
SO FLATCHEM
AB Two-dimensional (2D) transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD) semiconductors, with MoS2 as the most widely researched one, have large potential for development of novel devices. This calls for scalable and controllable fabrication of TMD monolayers and their heterostructures with high-quality interfaces, controllable stack orientation and pristine properties. Molecular Beam Epitaxy (MBE) allows the growth of 2D van der Waals materials and offers unparalleled control of cleanliness and growth parameters. However, these advantages are limited by eligible growth substrates, which are often incompatible with the desired application. Here we show the growth of a heterostructure based on nanometer sized MoS2 islands on a macroscopic graphene sheet on Ir (1 1 1) and the subsequent transfer of the heterostructure to a Si wafer. The heterostructure is delaminated from the substrate by a two-step electrochemical process involving a sacrificial PMMA layer to ensure efficient transfer. Detailed scanning probe and spectroscopic characterization at different stages of the process confirm the high sample quality, which is maintained throughout the procedure. This method remedies the substrate constraints imposed by MBE and allows to harness its quality and tunability for applications in photonics, electronics and quantum technology.

TI Moiré magnetism and moiré excitons in twisted CrSBr bilayers
SO PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF
   AMERICA
AB Moir & eacute; excitons and moir & eacute; magnetism are essential to semiconducting van der Waals magnets. In this work, we perform a comprehensive first- principles study to elucidate the interplay of electronic excitation and magnetism in twisted magnetic CrSBr bilayers. We predict a twist- induced quantum phase transition for interlayer magnetic coupling and estimate the critical twist angle below which moir & eacute; magnetism with mixed ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic domains could emerge. Localized one- dimensional moir & eacute; excitons are stable if the interlayer coupling is ferromagnetic and become unstable if the coupling turns to antiferromagnetic. Exciton energy modulation by magnons is estimated and dependence of exciton oscillator strength on the twist angle and interlayer coupling is analyzed. An orthogonally twisted bilayer is revealed to exhibit layer- dependent, anisotropic optical transitions. Electric field is shown to induce net magnetic moments in moir & eacute; excitons, endowing them with exceedingly long lifetimes. Our work lays the foundation for using magnetic moir & eacute; bilayers in spintronic, optoelectronic, and quantum information applications.

TI Nonlinear Rydberg exciton-polaritons in Cu2O microcavities
SO LIGHT-SCIENCE & APPLICATIONS
AB Rydberg excitons (analogues of Rydberg atoms in condensed matter systems) are highly excited bound electron-hole states with large Bohr radii. The interaction between them as well as exciton coupling to light may lead to strong optical nonlinearity, with applications in sensing and quantum information processing. Here, we achieve strong effective photon-photon interactions (Kerr-like optical nonlinearity) via the Rydberg blockade phenomenon and the hybridisation of excitons and photons forming polaritons in a Cu2O-filled microresonator. Under pulsed resonant excitation polariton resonance frequencies are renormalised due to the reduction of the photon-exciton coupling with increasing exciton density. Theoretical analysis shows that the Rydberg blockade plays a major role in the experimentally observed scaling of the polariton nonlinearity coefficient as alpha n(4.4 +/- 1.8) for principal quantum numbers up to n = 7. Such high principal quantum numbers studied in a polariton system for the first time are essential for realisation of high Rydberg optical nonlinearities, which paves the way towards quantum optical applications and fundamental studies of strongly correlated photonic (polaritonic) states in a solid state system.

TI Manipulation and enhancement of Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen steering between
   two mechanical modes generated by two Bogoliubov dissipation pathways
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB We consider a three-mode optomechanical system in which two mechanical oscillators are independently coupled to a cavity mode driven by two controllable lasers. By controlling the two-tone driving, one can prepare the entanglement and Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR) steering of two mechanical modes, in which the cavity mode acts as a single reservoir to cool two Bogoliubov modes. We find that the direction of EPR steering can be manipulated effectively by adjusting the damping rates and the thermal noises of two mechanical modes. In addition, we show that the entanglement and EPR steering between two mechanical modes can be enhanced by adding a parametric amplifier (PA) into the cavity. The effects of the strength and phase of the PA on the mechanical entanglement and EPR steering are analyzed and discussed in detail. Meanwhile, the additional PA can also expand the region of the one-way steering and strengthen the robustness of the entanglement and EPR steering against the thermal noise. The present scheme may provide effective resources for quantum information processing.

TI Quantum bath engineering of a high impedance microwave mode through
   quasiparticle tunneling
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB In microwave quantum optics, dissipation usually corresponds to quantum jumps, where photons are lost one by one. Here we demonstrate a new approach to dissipation engineering. By coupling a high impedance microwave resonator to a tunnel junction, we use the photoassisted tunneling of quasiparticles as a tunable dissipative process. We are able to adjust the minimum number of lost photons per tunneling event to be one, two or more, through a dc voltage. Consequently, different Fock states of the resonator experience different loss processes. Causality then implies that each state experiences a different energy (Lamb) shift, as confirmed experimentally. This photoassisted tunneling process is analogous to a photoelectric effect, which requires a quantum description of light to be quantitatively understood. This work opens up new possibilities for quantum state manipulation in superconducting circuits, which do not rely on the Josephson effect.
   Quantum bath engineering in the context of circuit quantum electrodynamics typically relies on single-photon losses. Aiello et al. demonstrate an approach for engineering higher-order photon losses in a microwave resonator coupled to a tunnel junction, which may be utilized in quantum information applications.

TI Operational Characterization of Infinite-Dimensional Quantum Resources
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB Recently, various nonclassical properties of quantum states and channels have been characterized through an advantage they provide in quantum information tasks over their classical counterparts. Such advantage can be typically proven to be quantitative, in that larger amounts of quantum resources lead to better performance in the corresponding tasks. So far, these characterizations have been established only in the finite-dimensional setting, hence, leaving out central resources in continuous variable systems such as entanglement and nonclassicality of states as well as entanglement breaking and broadcasting channels. In this Letter, we present a fully general framework for resource quantification in infinite-dimensional systems. The framework is applicable to a wide range of resources with the only premises being that classical randomness cannot create a resource and that the resourceless objects form a closed set in an appropriate sense. As the latter may be hard to establish for the abstract topologies of continuous variable systems, we provide a relaxation of the condition with no reference to topology. This envelopes the aforementioned resources and various others, hence, giving them an interpretation as performance enhancement in so-called input-output games.

TI Relative entropy and curved spacetimes
SO JOURNAL OF GEOMETRY AND PHYSICS
AB Given any half-sided modular inclusion of standard subspaces, we show that the entropy function associated with the decreasing one-parameter family of translated standard subspaces is convex for any given (not necessarily smooth) vector in the underlying Hilbert space. In second quantisation, this infers the convexity of the vacuum relative entropy with respect to the translation parameter of the modular tunnel of von Neumann algebras. This result allows us to study the QNEC inequality for coherent states in a free Quantum Field Theory on a stationary curved spacetime, given a KMS state. To this end, we define wedge regions and appropriate (deformed) subregions. Examples are given by the Schwarzschild spacetime and null translated subregions with respect to the time translation Killing flow. More generally, we define wedge and strip regions on a globally hyperbolic spacetime, so to have non trivial modular inclusions of von Neumann algebras, and make our analysis in this context.

TI Gate-defined Josephson junctions in magic-angle twisted bilayer graphene
SO NATURE NANOTECHNOLOGY
AB In situ electrostatic control of two-dimensional superconductivity(1) is commonly limited due to large charge carrier densities, and gate-defined Josephson junctions are therefore rare(2,3). Magic-angle twisted bilayer graphene (MATBG)(4-8) has recently emerged as a versatile platform that combines metallic, superconducting, magnetic and insulating phases in a single crystal(9-14). Although MATBG appears to be an ideal two-dimensional platform for gate-tunable superconductivity(9,11,13), progress towards practical implementations has been hindered by the need for well-defined gated regions. Here we use multilayer gate technology to create a device based on two distinct phases in adjustable regions of MATBG. We electrostatically define the superconducting and insulating regions of a Josephson junction and observe tunable d.c. and a.c. Josephson effects(15,16). The ability to tune the superconducting state within a single material circumvents interface and fabrication challenges, which are common in multimaterial nanostructures. This work is an initial step towards devices where gate-defined correlated states are connected in single-crystal nanostructures. We envision applications in superconducting electronics(17,18) and quantum information technology(19,20).

TI Topological Green's Function Zeros in an Exactly Solved Model and Beyond
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB The interplay of topological electronic band structures and strong interparticle interactions provides a promising path towards the constructive design of robust, long-range entangled many-body systems. As a prototype for such systems, we here study an exactly integrable, local model for a fractionalized topological insulator. Using a controlled perturbation theory about this limit, we demonstrate the existence of topological bands of zeros in the exact fermionic Green's function and show that in this model they do affect the topological invariant of the system, but not the quantized transport response. Close to (but prior to) the Higgs transition signaling the breakdown of fractionalization, the topological bands of zeros acquire a finite "lifetime." We also discuss the appearance of edge states and edge zeros at real space domain walls separating different phases of the system. This model provides a fertile ground for controlled studies of the phenomenology of Green's function zeros and the underlying exactly solvable lattice gauge theory illustrates the synergetic cross pollination between solid-state theory, high-energy physics, and quantum information science.

SO FRONTIERS OF OPTOELECTRONICS
AB In recent years, graphene field-effect-transistors (GFETs) have demonstrated an outstanding potential for terahertz (THz) photodetection due to their fast response and high-sensitivity. Such features are essential to enable emerging THz applications, including 6G wireless communications, quantum information, bioimaging and security. However, the overall performance of these photodetectors may be utterly compromised by the impact of internal resistances presented in the device, so-called access or parasitic resistances. In this work, we provide a detailed study of the influence of internal device resistances in the photoresponse of high-mobility dual-gate GFET detectors. Such dual-gate architectures allow us to fine tune (decrease) the internal resistance of the device by an order of magnitude and consequently demonstrate an improved responsivity and noise-equivalent-power values of the photodetector, respectively. Our results can be well understood by a series resistance model, as shown by the excellent agreement found between the experimental data and theoretical calculations. These findings are therefore relevant to understand and improve the overall performance of existing high-mobility graphene photodetectors.

TI Tailoring coupled topological corner states in photonic crystals via
   symmetry breaking induced by defects
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB In this paper, we present an effective approach to tailor the optical properties of coupled corner states in photonic crystal (PhC) supercell arrays by symmetry breaking. Defects are strategically introduced into unit cells to break the in -plane C4v symmetry, and numerical simulations confirm the preservation of the band gap and two-dimensional Zak phases, in spite of the presence of defects. Notably, the size of defects is demonstrated to play a significant role in tuning the eigenfrequencies, quality (Q) factors, and band structures of the coupled corner states. Furthermore, these defects exhibit the ability to transform topological dark states into bright states, enabling efficient excitation by external plane waves and polarization -dependent Q factors. The resonant origin of the coupled corner states is comprehensively elucidated using a multipole decomposition analysis. This study further releases the potential of the topological light -matter interaction, holding significant implications for the design and advancement of topological photonic devices with on -demand tunability and multifrequency regions for various applications such as lasing, sensing, and quantum information processing.

TI Sub-1 Volt and high-bandwidth visible to near-infrared electro-optic
   modulators
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Integrated electro-optic (EO) modulators are fundamental photonics componentswith utility in domains ranging fromdigital communications to quantum information processing. At telecommunication wavelengths, thin-film lithium niobate modulators exhibit state-of-the-art performance in voltage-length product (VpL), optical loss, and EObandwidth. However, applications in optical imaging, optogenetics, and quantum science generally require devices operating in the visible-to-near-infrared (VNIR) wavelength range. Here, we realize VNIR amplitude and phase modulators featuring V pi L's of sub-1 V center dot cm, low optical loss, and high bandwidth EO response. Our Mach-Zehnder modulators exhibit a V pi L as low as 0.55 V center dot cm at 738 nm, on-chip optical loss of similar to 0.7 dB/cm, and EO bandwidths in excess of 35GHz. Furthermore, we highlight the opportunities these high-performance modulators offer by demonstrating integrated EO frequency combs operating at VNIR wavelengths, with over 50 lines and tunable spacing, and frequency shifting of pulsed light beyond its intrinsic bandwidth (up to 7x Fourier limit) by an EO shearing method.

TI In situ amplification of spin echoes within a kinetic inductance
   parametric amplifier
SO SCIENCE ADVANCES
AB The use of superconducting microresonators together with quantum-limited Josephson parametric amplifiers has enhanced the sensitivity of pulsed electron spin resonance (ESR) measurements by more than four orders of magnitude. So far, the microwave resonators and amplifiers have been designed as separate components due to the incompatibility of Josephson junction-based devices with magnetic fields. This has produced complex spectrometers and raised technical barriers toward adoption of the technique. Here, we circumvent this issue by coupling an ensemble of spins directly to a weakly nonlinear and magnetic field-resilient superconducting microwave resonator. We perform pulsed ESR measurements with a 1-pL mode volume containing 6 x 10(7) spins and amplify the resulting signals within the device. When considering only those spins that contribute to the detected signals, we find a sensitivity of 2.8 x10(3)spins/root Hz for a Hahn echo sequence at a temperature of 400 mK. In situ amplification is demonstrated at fields up to 254 mT, highlighting the technique's potential for application under conventional ESR operating conditions.

TI Wavelength-Tunable and OAM-Switchable Ultrafast Fiber Laser Enabled by
   Intracavity Polarization Control
SO IEEE PHOTONICS JOURNAL
AB Ultrafast laser that directly emits vortex beam has broad application prospects in many research fields and applications, such as telecommunication, bio-sampling and quantum information science. In this article, we demonstrate a wavelength-tunable and OAM-switchable ultrafast fiber laser enabled by intracavity polarization controlling elements. The mode-locked laser can emit vortex beam outputs with a topological charge of l = +1 or l = -1 and the center wavelength can be continuously tuned from 1015 nm to 1038nm. The obtained output pulse has a pulse energy of 3.3 nJ and a compressed pulse duration of 87 fs. Compared with previous results, this laser can emit OAM-switchable output with a shorter pulse duration and a broad wavelength tuning range. The concept of adding polarization control elements to a mode-locked fiber laser can be further expanded to build laser with more sophisticated and customizable outputs.

TI Proposal for measuring out-of-time-ordered correlators at finite
   temperature with coupled spin chains
SO NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB Information scrambling, which is the spread of local information through a system's many-body degrees of freedom, is an intrinsic feature of many-body dynamics. In quantum systems, the out-of-time-ordered correlator (OTOC) quantifies information scrambling. Motivated by experiments that have measured the OTOC at infinite temperature and a theory proposal to measure the OTOC at finite temperature using the thermofield double state, we describe a protocol to measure the OTOC in a finite temperature spin chain that is realized approximately as one half of the ground state of two moderately-sized coupled spin chains. We consider a spin Hamiltonian with particle-hole symmetry, for which we show that the OTOC can be measured without needing sign-reversal of the Hamiltonian. We describe a protocol to mitigate errors in the estimated OTOC, arising from the finite approximation of the system to the thermofield double state. We show that our protocol is also robust to main sources of decoherence in experiments.

TI Optical generation of strong-field terahertz radiation and its
   application in nonlinear terahertz metasurfaces
SO NANOPHOTONICS
AB Extremely nonlinear terahertz (THz)-matter interactions and applications have positioned themselves as the next frontier in quantum information, nonlinear optics, and particle acceleration. However, the absence of free-space highly intense THz sources and the diffraction limit, which prevents THz waves from being concentrated to the nanoscale scale, are inhibiting the growth of extreme THz. To address this difficulty, suitably extremely concentrated THz sources are being produced, while (non-)resonant artificial metastructures are being widely used to enhance local fields, resulting in deep-subwavelength (<lambda/10(3)) confinement of highly enhanced THz fields in micro-/nano-gaps. We discuss solid-state stable sources of intense THz radiation generated by femtosecond lasers in this Review, with a special emphasis on the lithium niobate-based tilted pulse front approach and the nonlinear THz metasurfaces allowed by it. Finally, we forecast the field's future directions in extreme THz research.

TI Nonlinear Squeezing for Measurement-Based Non-Gaussian Operations in
   Time Domain
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW APPLIED
AB Quantum non-Gaussian gate is a missing piece to the realization of continuous-variable universal quantum operations in an optical system. In a measurement-based implementation of the cubic phase gate, a lowest-order non-Gaussian gate, non-Gaussian ancillary states that have a property we call nonlinear squeezing are required. This property, however, has never been experimentally verified. In this paper, we generate a superposition between a vacuum state and a single-photon state whose nonlinear squeezing is maximized by the optimization of the superposition coefficients. The nonlinear squeezing is observed via real-time quadrature measurements, meaning that the generated states are compatible with real-time feedforward and are suitable as ancillary states for the cubic phase gate in the time domain. Moreover, by increasing the number of photons, it is expected that nonlinear squeezing can be further improved. The idea presented here can be readily extended to higher-order phase gates [P. Marek et al., Phys. Rev. A 97, 022329 (2018)]. As such, this work presents an important step to extend continuous-variable quantum information processing from Gaussian regime to non-Gaussian regime.

TI Smarter usage of measurement statistics can greatly improve continuous
   variable quantum reservoir computing
SO NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB Quantum reservoir computing (QRC) is a machine learning paradigm in which a quantum system is used to perform information processing. A prospective approach to its physical realization is a photonic platform in which continuous variable quantum information methods are applied. The simplest continuous variable quantum states are Gaussian states, which can be efficiently simulated classically. As such, they provide a benchmark for the level of performance that non-Gaussian states should surpass in order to give a quantum advantage. In this article we propose two methods to increase the information processing capacity of QRC with Gaussian states compared to previous QRC schemes. We consider better utilization of the measurement distribution by sampling its cumulative distribution function. We show it provides memory in areas that conventional approaches are lacking, as well as improving the overall processing capacity of the reservoir. We also consider storing past measurement results in classical memory, and show that it improves the memory capacity and can be used to mitigate the effects of statistical noise due to finite measurement ensemble.

TI Spin-Polarized Antiferromagnets for Spintronics
SO ADVANCED MATERIALS
AB Spin-polarized antiferromagnets (AFMs), including altermagnets, noncollinear AFMs, and 2D layer-polarized AFMs, have emerged as transformative materials for next-generation spintronic and optoelectronic technologies. These systems uniquely combine spin-polarized electronic states with vanishing net magnetization, enabling ultrafast spin dynamics, high-density integration, and robustness against stray magnetic fields. Their unconventional symmetry-breaking mechanisms-governed by crystal symmetry, chiral spin textures, or interlayer potential control-give rise to emergent phenomena previously exclusive to ferromagnets: nonrelativistic spin-momentum locking, spontaneous anomalous transport phenomena, gate-tunable magneto-optical responses, nonrelativistic spin-polarized current, and tunneling magnetoresistance effect. This review systematically examines the fundamental principles linking symmetry, band topology, and transport properties across these material classes, synthesizing recent breakthroughs in both theory and experiment. Critical challenges are further identified in achieving room-temperature functionality, scalable N & eacute;el vector control, and coherent spin-current manipulation, while outlining pathways to harness these materials for ultra-low-power memory, spin-logic architectures, and quantum information technologies.

TI First-principles computational methods for quantum defects in
   two-dimensional materials: A perspective
SO APPLIED PHYSICS LETTERS
AB Quantum defects are atomic defects in materials that provide resources to construct quantum information devices such as single-photon emitters and spin qubits. Recently, two-dimensional (2D) materials gained prominence as a host of quantum defects with many attractive features derived from their atomically thin and layered material formfactor. In this Perspective, we discuss first-principles computational methods and challenges to predict the spin and electronic properties of quantum defects in 2D materials. We focus on the open quantum system nature of the defects and their interaction with external parameters such as electric field, magnetic field, and lattice strain. We also discuss how such prediction and understanding can be used to guide experimental studies, ranging from defect identification to tuning of their spin and optical properties. This Perspective provides significant insights into the interplay between the defect, the host material, and the environment, which will be essential in the pursuit of ideal two-dimensional quantum defect platforms.

TI Heisenberg-limited spin squeezing in a hybrid system with
   silicon-vacancy centers
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB In this paper, we investigate the spin squeezing in a hybrid quantum system consisting of a Silicon-Vacancy (SiV) center ensemble coupled to a diamond acoustic waveguide via the strain interaction. Two sets of non-overlapping driving fields, each contains two time-dependent microwave fields, are applied to this hybrid system. By modulating these fields, the one-axis twist (OAT) interaction and two-axis two-spin (TATS) interaction can be independently realized. In the latter case the squeezing parameter scales to spin number as xi R2 similar to 1.61N-0.64 with the consideration of dissipation, which is very close to the Heisenberg limit. Furthermore, this hybrid system allows for the study of spin squeezing generated by the simultaneous presence of OAT and TATS interactions, which reveals sensitivity to the parity of the number of spins Ntot, whether it is even or odd. Our scheme enriches the approach for generating Heisenberg-limited spin squeezing in spin-phonon hybrid systems and offers the possibility for future applications in quantum information processing.

TI Generation of perfect optical vortex arrays by an optical pen
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB Recently, perfect optical vortexes (POVs) have attracted substantial attention, because they have an orbital angular momentum (OAM) and the beam diameter is independent of the topological charges. There are numerous innovative results that have been found by modulating the POV optical field. However, methods for controlling the arbitrary parameters of POV are lacking. In this paper, we use the optical pen to overcome this problem. The optical pen is a high-precision optical field modulation method construction based on the relationship between the optical path difference and phase. Based on this method, we have achieved POV arrays with controllable arbitrary parameters in free space, including the spatial position, numbers, topological charges, beam diameter, and amplitude. This work can be applied not only in the fields of optical tweezers, particle manipulation, and super-resolution microscopic imaging, but also will promote the development of optical communication, quantum information coding, and so on.

TI Robust Shadow Estimation
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB Efficiently estimating properties of large and strongly coupled quantum systems is a central focus in many-body physics and quantum information theory. While quantum computers promise speedups for many of these tasks, near-term devices are prone to noise that will generally reduce the accuracy of such estimates. Here, we propose a sample-efficient and noise-resilient protocol for learning properties of quantum states building on the shadow estimation scheme [Huang et al., Nature Physics 16, 1050-1057 (2020)]. By introducing an experimentally friendly calibration procedure, our protocol can efficiently characterize and mitigate noises in the shadow estimation scheme, given only minimal assumptions on the experimental conditions. When the strength of noises can be bounded, our protocol approximately retains the same order of sample efficiency as the standard shadow estimation scheme, while also possessing a provable noise resilience. We give rigorous bounds on the sample complexity of our protocol and demonstrate its performance with several numerical experiments, including estimations of quantum fidelity, correlation functions and energy expectations, etc., which highlight a wide spectrum of potential applications of our protocol on near-term devices.

   development in higher education:A systematic literature review and
   research agenda
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT EDUCATION
AB Against the strategic backdrop of the digital and intelligent transformation of global higher education, the emerging cluster of technologies with artificial intelligence (AI) at its core is fundamentally reshaping the operational logic and value ecosystem of business education systems. To comprehensively understand the current research landscape and progress of AI and business talent development, this study conducts a systematic literature review, retrieving 192 research articles published between 2015 and 2024 from the Scopus and Web of Science databases. Based on descriptive statistics and CiteSpace bibliometric analysis, this study summarizes the major progress and key findings of the past decade across four domains of business talent development in higher education. The study further provides practical implications for business school administrators and faculty, highlighting insufficient attention to macro-level issues such as core AI competencies, curriculum restructuring, and institutional resource support. It also notes the lack of in-depth reflection on the mechanisms through which AI is embedded in business talent development. In addition, through further analysis of theoretical frameworks and research methods, this study suggests that future academic research should explore emerging frontier topics such as artificial general intelligence and quantum algorithms, promote interdisciplinary integration of business education with neuroscience, social sciences, and environmental science, place greater emphasis on longitudinal research, and adopt research paradigms driven by both data and mechanisms.

TI Engineering cm-scale true push-pull electro-optic modulators in a
   suspended GaAs photonic integrated circuit platform by exploiting the
   orientation induced asymmetry of the Pockels r41
   coefficient
SO NANOPHOTONICS
AB Electro-optic modulators (EOMs) underpin a wide range of critical applications in both classical and quantum information processing. While these devices have been extensively optimized in a wide range of materials from ferroelectric insulators like lithium niobate to semiconductors like gallium arsenide and indium phosphide, there is a need to explore new design and manufacturing methods with a view towards improving device performance. Here, we demonstrate true push-pull EOMs in a suspended GaAs photonic integrated circuit (PIC) platform by exploiting the orientation induced asymmetry of the Pockels r41 coefficient, and folding the two arms of a cm-scale Mach-Zehnder interferometer (MZI) modulator along two orthogonal crystal axes. Our work also shows the potential of incorporating ideas from micro-electro-mechanical systems (MEMS) in integrated photonics by demonstrating high-performance active devices built around cm-scale suspended waveguides with sub-mu m optical mode confinement.

TI The p-Adic Jaynes-Cummings Model in Symplectic Geometry
SO JOURNAL OF NONLINEAR SCIENCE
AB The notion of classical p-adic integrable system on a p-adic symplectic manifold was proposed by Voevodsky, Warren, and the second author a decade ago in analogy with the real case. In the present paper, we introduce and study, from the viewpoint of symplectic geometry and topology, the basic properties of the p-adic version of the classical Jaynes-Cummings model. The Jaynes-Cummings model is a fundamental example of an integrable system going back to the work of Jaynes and Cummings in the 1960s, and which applies to many physical situations, for instance in quantum optics and quantum information theory. Several of our results depend on the value of p: The structure of the model depends on the class of the prime p modulo 4 and p=2\documentclass[12pt]{minimal} \usepackage{amsmath} \usepackage{wasysym} \usepackage{amsfonts} \usepackage{amssymb} \usepackage{amsbsy} \usepackage{mathrsfs} \usepackage{upgreek} \setlength{\oddsidemargin}{-69pt} \begin{document}$$p=2$$\end{document} requires special treatment.

TI Epitaxy of Emerging Materials and Advanced Heterostructures for
   Microelectronics and Quantum Sciences
SO SMALL METHODS
AB Epitaxy, a process to prepare crystalline materials in nanostructures and thin films, is the core technology for preparing high-quality materials as a key enabler of next-generation microelectronics and quantum information system. Progress in epitaxy has been expanding the choice of materials and their heterostructures beyond the combinations limited by materials compatibility. However, the improvement of material quality, physical implementation of materials with unique properties, and integration of incommensurate materials in an architecture have been the challenging issues. Emerging materials, including 2D materials and quantum materials, have opened opportunities to study epitaxy mechanisms and realize various functional devices. Acceleration of discovery and progress in epitaxy research should be accomplished by "understanding of epitaxy under various circumstances at multiple length scales" and "integration of experiments and models." In the perspective, a basic summary of the status of epitaxially grown materials, the challenges in epitaxy research, and integration of modeling epitaxy and ultimate control of the epitaxy process with advanced characterization techniques are discussed.

TI Basis-independent quantum coherence and its distribution under
   relativistic motion
SO EUROPEAN PHYSICAL JOURNAL C
AB Recent studies have increasingly focused on the effect of relativistic motion on quantum coherence. Prior research predominantly examined the influence of relative motion on basis-dependent quantum coherence, underscoring its susceptibility to decoherence under accelerated conditions. Yet, the effect of relativistic motion on basis-independent quantum coherence, which is critical for understanding the intrinsic quantum features of a system, remains an interesting open question. This paper addresses this question by examining how total, collective, and localized coherence are affected by acceleration and coupling strength. Our analysis reveals that both total and collective coherence significantly decrease with increasing acceleration and coupling strength, ultimately vanishing at high levels of acceleration. This underscores the profound impact of Unruh thermal noise. Conversely, localized coherence exhibits relative stability, decreasing to zero only under the extreme condition of infinite acceleration. Moreover, we demonstrate that collective, localized, and basis-independent coherence collectively satisfy the triangle inequality. These findings are crucial for enhancing our understanding of quantum information dynamics in environments subjected to high acceleration and offer valuable insights on the behavior of quantum coherence under relativistic conditions.

TI Effectively modulating spatial vortex four-wave mixing in a diamond
   atomic system
SO CHINESE PHYSICS B
AB Due to the spatial characteristics of orbital angular momentum, vortex fields can be applied in the fields of quantum storage and quantum information. We study the realization of spatially modulated vortex fields based on four-wave mixing in a four-level atomic system with a diamond structure. The intensity and spiral phase of the vortex field are effectively transferred to the generated four-wave mixing field. By changing the detuning of the probe field, the phase and intensity of the generated vertex four-wave mixing field can be changed. When the probe field takes a large detuning value, the spatial distribution of the intensity and phase of the vertex four-wave mixing field can be effectively tuned by adjusting the Rabi frequency or detuning value of the coupled field. At the same time, we also provide a detailed explanation based on the dispersion relationship, and the results agree well with our simulation results.

TI Control limit for the quantum state preparation under stochastic control
   errors
SO PROCEEDINGS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY A-MATHEMATICAL PHYSICAL AND ENGINEERING
   SCIENCES
AB We investigate the effect of stochastic control errors on the Hamiltonian that controls a closed quantum system. Quantum information technologies require careful control for preparing a desired state used as an information resource. However, because the stochastic control errors inevitably appear in realistic situations, it is difficult to completely implement the control Hamiltonian. Under this error, the actual performance of quantum control is far away from the ideal one, and thus it is of great importance to evaluate the effect of the control errors. In this paper, we derive a lower bound of the fidelity between two closed quantum systems obeying the dynamics with and without errors. This bound reveals a reachable and unreachable set of the controlled quantum system under stochastic noises. Also, it is easily computable without considering the stochastic process and needing the full dynamics of the states. We demonstrate the actual performance of this bound via a simple control example. Furthermore, based on this result, we quantitatively evaluate the probability of obtaining the target state in the presence of control errors.

TI The Quantum Geometric Tensor in a Parameter-Dependent Curved Space
SO ENTROPY
AB We introduce a quantum geometric tensor in a curved space with a parameter-dependent metric, which contains the quantum metric tensor as the symmetric part and the Berry curvature corresponding to the antisymmetric part. This parameter-dependent metric modifies the usual inner product, which induces modifications in the quantum metric tensor and Berry curvature by adding terms proportional to the derivatives with respect to the parameters of the determinant of the metric. The quantum metric tensor is obtained in two ways: By using the definition of the infinitesimal distance between two states in the parameter-dependent curved space and via the fidelity susceptibility approach. The usual Berry connection acquires an additional term with which the curved inner product converts the Berry connection into an object that transforms as a connection and density of weight one. Finally, we provide three examples in one dimension with a nontrivial metric: an anharmonic oscillator, a Morse-like potential, and a generalized anharmonic oscillator; and one in two dimensions: the coupled anharmonic oscillator in a curved space.

TI Spin-orbit-locked hyperbolic polariton vortices carrying reconfigurable
   topological charges
SO ELIGHT
AB The topological features of optical vortices have been opening opportunities for free-space and on-chip photonic technologies, e.g., for multiplexed optical communications and robust information transport. In a parallel but disjoint effort, polar anisotropic van der Waals nanomaterials supporting hyperbolic phonon polaritons (HP2s) have been leveraged to drastically boost light-matter interactions. So far HP2 studies have been mainly focusing on the control of their amplitude and scale features. Here we report the generation and observation of mid-infrared hyperbolic polariton vortices (HP2Vs) associated with reconfigurable topological charges. Spiral-shaped gold disks coated with a flake of hexagonal boron nitride are exploited to tailor spin-orbit interactions and realise deeply subwavelength HP2Vs. The complex interplay between excitation spin, spiral geometry and HP2 dispersion enables robust reconfigurability of the associated topological charges. Our results reveal unique opportunities to extend the application of HP2s into topological photonics, quantum information processing by integrating these phenomena with single-photon emitters, robust on-chip optical applications, sensing and nanoparticle manipulation.

TI Manipulating strong coupling between exciton and quasibound states in
   the continuum resonance
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
AB Strong coupling exhibits the unique ability to preserve quantum sates between light and matter, which is essential for the development of quantum information technology. To explore the physical mechanism behind this phenomenon, we employ the tight-binding method for expanding the temporal coupled-mode theory, with the absorption spectrum formula of coupled system directly obtained in an analytical way. It reveals all the physical meaning of parameters defined in our theory and shows how to tailor line shapes of the coupled systems. Here we set an example to manipulate the strong coupling in a hybrid structure composed of excitons in monolayer WS2 and quasibound states in the continuum supported by the TiO2 nanodisk metasurfaces. The simulated results show that a clear spectral splitting appeared in the absorption curve, which can be controlled by adjusting the asymmetric parameter of the nanodisk metasurfaces and well fitted through our theoretical predictions. Our work not only gives a more comprehensive understanding of such coupled systems but also offers a promising strategy in controlling strong light???matter coupling to meet diversified application requests.

TI All-optical modulation of quantum states by nonlinear metasurface
SO LIGHT-SCIENCE & APPLICATIONS
AB Metasurfaces have proven themselves an exotic ability to harness light at nano-scale, being important not only for classical but also for quantum optics. Dynamic manipulation of the quantum states is at the heart of quantum information processing; however, such function has been rarely realized with metasurfaces so far. Here, we report an all-optical dynamic modulation of the photonic quantum states using the nonlinear metasurface. The metasurface consists of a metallic nanostructure combined with a photoisomerizable azo layer. By tuning the plasmonic resonance through optically switching the azo molecules between their binary isomeric states, we have realized dynamic control of transmission efficiencies of orthogonally polarized photons and also the phase delay between them, thereby an entangled state was efficiently controlled. As an illustration, a quantum state distillation has been demonstrated to recover a Bell state from a non-maximally entangled one to that with fidelities higher than 98%. Our work would enrich the functions of the metasurface in the quantum world, from static to dynamic modulation, making the quantum metasurface going practical.

TI Revolutionary Optical Imaging Enabled by Vectorial and Flat Optics
SO ADVANCED MATERIALS TECHNOLOGIES
AB Revolutionary optical imaging enabled by vectorial and flat optics marks a transformative paradigm that unites subwavelength photonic engineering, full-vector light-field control (amplitude, phase, and polarization), and planar optical architectures. Conventional imaging systems, constrained by curved-optics geometry and scalar diffraction theory, face intrinsic trade-offs among spatial resolution, field of view (FOV), and system compactness. By harnessing flat optical elements such as metasurfaces and catenary-phase devices together with vectorial manipulation, this emerging field transcends those limitations. The review highlights three fundamental breakthroughs: (1) Abrupt phase shifts in subwavelength scale enabling ultrathin, wide-FOV planar imaging; (2) Evanescent-propagating wave conversion under appropriate near-field coupling conditions, and vectorial optical synthetic apertures achieving far-field super-resolution beyond the diffraction limit; (3) Computational optics that integrates sensing and computing in a unified physical platform. These advances enable intelligent, programmable imaging systems that transcend the limitations of traditional optics, with applications spanning biomedical nanoscopy, remote sensing, and quantum information.

TI Phase Characterization of Singular Metasurfaces
SO ACS PHOTONICS
AB The controlled generation and accurate characterization of light beams carrying orbital angular momentum (OAM) are essential for emerging applications in optical communication, quantum information, and advanced imaging. Metasurfaces offer a versatile platform for tailoring such structured electromagnetic fields. However, the accurate measurement of wavefronts containing multiple phase singularities remains a significant metrological challenge. In this work, we employ quadriwave lateral shearing interferometry (QLSI) as a quantitative phase imaging technique to retrieve spatially resolved phase maps of OAM beams generated by metasurfaces. We demonstrate that QLSI enables robust reconstruction of perfect and imperfect singular phase profiles, providing a reliable tool for the characterization of complex optical fields. This methodology is applied to evaluate metasurfaces designed using two distinct phase encoding mechanisms: effective refractive index (ERI) modulation and Pancharatnam-Berry (PB) phase. Comparative analysis reveals superior phase accuracy and enhanced fabrication tolerance in PB-based metasurfaces relative to ERI counterparts. These results highlight the potential of QLSI as a diagnostic and validation tool for structured light generation in next-generation photonic devices.

TI The Cramer-Rao approach and global quantum estimation of bosonic states
SO QUANTUM
AB Quantum state estimation is a fundamental task in quantum information theory, where one estimates real parameters continuously embedded in a family of quantum states. In the theory of quantum state estimation, the widely used Cramer Rao approach which considers local estimation gives the ultimate precision bound of quantum state estimation in terms of the quantum Fisher information. However practical scenarios need not offer much prior information about the parameters to be estimated, and the local estimation setting need not apply. In general, it is unclear whether the Cramer-Rao approach is applicable for global estimation instead of local estimation. In this paper, we find situations where the Cramer-Rao approach does and does not work for quantum state estimation problems involving a family of bosonic states in a non-IID setting, where we only use one copy of the bosonic quantum state in the large number of bosons setting. Our result highlights the importance of caution when using the results of the Cramer-Rao approach to extrapolate to the global estimation setting.

TI Ultrasteep Slope Cryogenic FETs Based on Bilayer Graphene
SO NANO LETTERS
AB Cryogenic field-effect transistors (FETs) offer great potential for applications, the most notable example being classical control electronics for quantum information processors. For the latter, on-chip FETs with low power consumption are crucial. This requires operating voltages in the millivolt range, which are only achievable in devices with ultrasteep subthreshold slopes. However, in conventional cryogenic metal-oxide-semiconductor (MOS)FETs based on bulk material, the experimentally achieved inverse subthreshold slopes saturate around a few mV/dec due to disorder and charged defects at the MOS interface. FETs based on two-dimensional materials offer a promising alternative. Here, we show that FETs based on Bernal stacked bilayer graphene encapsulated in hexagonal boron nitride and graphite gates exhibit inverse subthreshold slopes of down to 250 mu V/dec at 0.1 K, approaching the Boltzmann limit. This result indicates an effective suppression of band tailing in van der Waals heterostructures without bulk interfaces, leading to superior device performance at cryogenic temperature.

TI One-Step Implementation of Collective Anti-Blockade in a Rydberg Ring
SO PHOTONICS
AB In contrast to Rydberg blockade, Rydberg anti-blockade allows multiple atoms to be simultaneously excited in the presence of significant nonlocal interactions and can lead to distinct phenomena and applications. This inspires us to examine here general conditions, numerical verifications, and realistic restrictions regarding the collective anti-blockade excitations of N Rydberg atoms equally arranged along a ring. We find that by adjusting the detuning of a pump field to compensate for nonlocal interactions between one atom and all others, it is viable to realize resonant excitations of N atoms but suppress far-detuned excitations of N-1 and fewer atoms under different conditions for an odd and an even number of atoms. Population dynamics of this Rydberg ring further show that one-step anti-blockade implementation can be attained at a cutoff time of the pump field, which increases quickly with the number of atoms. Hence, roughly perfect anti-blockade excitations are attainable only for a not-too-large N due to inevitable spontaneous Rydberg decay.

TI Unconventional photon blockade in a non- Hermitian indirectly coupled
   resonator system
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB Photon blockade provides an effective way to realize the single-photon source, which attracts intensive attention in the fields of quantum optics and quantum information. Here in this study, we investigate photon blockade in a non-Hermitian indirectly coupled resonator system, which consists of a dissipative cavity and a Kerr nonlinear resonator coupled to two nano-scatters. We find that by tuning the coupling phase theta between the two resonators, the quantum interference could be induced on one side near the exceptional points (EPs), resulting in the unconventional photon blockade effect. Furthermore, it is noticed that the large Kerr nonlinearity is not always beneficial for unconventional photon blockades. There is an optimal threshold for the intensity of the Kerr nonlinearity and the phase angle. for the appearance of the unconventional photon blockade effect. We believe the current study has substantial consequences for investigating the physical characteristics close to EPs and presents a novel method for developing integrated on-chip single-photon sources.

TI Standard symmetrized variance with applications to coherence,
   uncertainty, and entanglement
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Variance is a ubiquitous quantity in quantum information theory. Given a basis, we consider the averaged variances of a fixed diagonal observable in a pure state under all possible permutations on the components of the pure state and call it symmetrized variance. Moreover, we work out the analytical expression of the symmetrized variance and find that such an expression is in the factorized form where two factors separately depend on the diagonal observable and quantum state. By shifting the factor corresponding to the diagonal observable, we introduce the notion referred to as standard symmetrized variance for the pure state which is independent of the diagonal observable. We then extend the standard symmetrized variance to mixed states in three different ways, which characterize the uncertainty, the coherence, and the coherence of assistance, respectively. These quantities are evaluated analytically and the relations among them are established. In addition, we show that standard symmetrized variance is also an entanglement measure for bipartite systems. In this way, these different quantumnesses of quantum states are unified by the variance.

TI Implementation of Quantum Level Addressability and Geometric Phase
   Manipulation in Aligned Endohedral Fullerene Qudits
SO ANGEWANDTE CHEMIE-INTERNATIONAL EDITION
AB Endohedral nitrogen fullerenes have been proposed as building blocks for quantum information processing due to their long spin coherence time. However, addressability of the individual electron spin levels in such a multiplet system of S-4(3/2) has never been achieved because of the molecular isotropy and transition degeneracy among the Zeeman levels. Herein, by molecular engineering, we lifted the degeneracy by zero-field splitting effects and made the multiple transitions addressable by a liquid-crystal-assisted method. The endohedral nitrogen fullerene derivatives with rigid addends of spiro structure and large aspect ratios of regioselective bis-addition improve the ordering of the spin ensemble. These samples empower endohedral-fullerene-based qudits, in which the transitions between the 4 electron spin levels were respectively addressed and coherently manipulated. The quantum geometric phase manipulation, which has long been proposed for the advantages in error tolerance and gating speed, was implemented in a pure electron spin system using molecules for the first time.

TI Highly accurate Gaussian process tomography with geometrical sets of
   coherent states
SO NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB We propose a practical strategy for choosing sets of input coherent states that are near-optimal for reconstructing single-mode Gaussian quantum processes with output-state heterodyne measurements. We first derive analytical expressions for the mean squared-error that quantifies the reconstruction accuracy for general process tomography and large data. Using such expressions, upon relaxing the trace-preserving (TP) constraint, we introduce an error-reducing set of input coherent states that is independent of the measurement data or the unknown true process-the geometrical set. We numerically show that process reconstruction from such input coherent states is nearly as accurate as that from the best possible set of coherent states chosen with the complete knowledge about the process. This allows us to efficiently characterize Gaussian processes even with reasonably low-energy coherent states. We numerically observe that the geometrical strategy without trace preservation beats all nonadaptive strategies for arbitrary TP Gaussian processes of typical parameter ranges so long as the displacement components are not too large.

TI Tracking the Coupling of Single Emitters to Plasmonic Nanoantennas with
   Single-Molecule Super-Resolution Imaging
SO ACS PHOTONICS
AB Metal nanoantennas enable the manipulation of light emission and detection at the single photon level by confining light into very small volumes. Emitters coupled to these plasmonic structures are thus ideal candidates for usage in quantum information technology. However, controllably and reproducibly placing quantum emitters into nanocavities has been challenging due to the sizes of the systems involved. Here, we investigate the trapping dynamics of single emitters into nanocavities via optical gradient forces by using single-molecule super-resolution imaging and tracking. We show that molecules trapped in the nanogaps of bowtie antennas have increased photostability and track lengths compared to molecules farther away from the structure. For resonant antennas, these effects are magnified compared to the off-resonant case due to stronger optical trapping effects. These results open the way to using plasmonic optical trapping to reliably couple single emitters to single nanoantennas, enabling further studies of these coupled systems.

TI Stable Signal Processing With a Photonic Processor
SO JOURNAL OF LIGHTWAVE TECHNOLOGY
AB A key objective in the development of integrated photonic circuits for large-scale optical quantum information processing is achieving both reconfigurability and stable output signals. One outcome of this development is the creation of multimode photonic processors, or reconfigurable multimode interferometers, which have broad applications in both quantum and classical information processing. However, active cooling systems introduce phase fluctuations in multi-port input signals, leading to instability in interference patterns and degrading signal processing precision. In this work, we implement an on-chip feedback control to mitigate input signal phase fluctuation. This approach reduces phase instability by more than 10-fold for multi-port input signals. This significantly enhances the precision and reliability of signal processing within the photonic processor. To validate the stability and repeatability of matrix multiplication using a feedback control scheme on a photonic processor, we successfully implemented Hadamard transformations of different orders with multi-port input signals.

TI Acoustic Modulation of Individual Nanowire Quantum Dots Integrated into
   a Hybrid Thin-Film Lithium Niobate Photonic Platform
SO NANO LETTERS
AB Surface acoustic waves are a powerful tool for controlling quantum systems, including quantum dots (QDs), where the oscillating strain field can modulate the emission wavelengths. We integrate InAsP/InP nanowire QDs onto a thin-film lithium niobate platform and embed them within Si3N4-loaded waveguides. We achieve a 0.70 nm peak-to-peak wavelength modulation at 13 dBm using a single focused interdigital transducer (FIDT) operating at 400 MHz, and we double this amplitude to 1.4 nm by using two FIDTs as an acoustic cavity. Additionally, we independently modulate two QDs with an initial wavelength difference of 0.5 nm, both integrated on the same chip. We show that their modulated emissions overlap, demonstrating the potential to bring them to a common emission wavelength after spectral filtering. This local strain-tuning represents a significant step toward generating indistinguishable single photons from remote emitters heterogeneously integrated on a single chip, advancing on-chip quantum information processing with multiple QDs.

TI Resolved-sideband cooling of a single 9Be+ ion in
   a cryogenic multi-Penning-trap for discrete symmetry tests with
   (anti-)protons
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Manipulating the motion of individual trapped ions at the single quantum level has become standard practice in radio-frequency ion traps, enabling sweeping advances in quantum information processing and precision metrology. The key step for motional-state engineering is ground-state cooling. Full motional control also bears great potential to explore another regime of sensitivities for fundamental physics tests in Penning traps. Here we demonstrate the key enabling step by implementing resolved-sideband cooling on the axial mode of a single Be-9(+) ion in a 5 Tesla cryogenic Penning trap. The system has been developed for the implementation of high-precision antimatter experiments to test the fundamental symmetries of the standard model with the highest accuracy in the baryonic sector. We measure an axial phonon number of n<overline>(z) = 0.10(4) . 10(4) after cooling and demonstrate that the axial heating rate in our system is compatible with the implementation of quantum logic spectroscopy of (anti-)protons.

TI Single-Atom Verification of the Optimal Trade-Off between Speed and Cost
   in Shortcuts to Adiabaticity
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB The approach of shortcuts to adiabaticity enables the effective execution of adiabatic dynamics in quantum information processing with enhanced speed. Owing to the inherent trade-off between dynamical speed and the cost associated with the transitionless driving field, executing arbitrarily fast operations becomes impractical. To understand the accurate interplay between speed and energetic cost in this process, we propose theoretically and verify experimentally a new trade-off, which is characterized by a tightly optimized bound within s-parametrized phase spaces. Our experiment is carried out in a single ultracold 40Ca+ ion trapped in a harmonic potential. By exactly operating the quantum states of the ion, we execute the Landau-Zener model as an example, where the quantum speed limit as well as the cost are governed by the spectral gap. We witness that our proposed trade-off is indeed tight in scenarios involving both initially eigenstates and initially thermal equilibrium states. Our work helps understanding the fundamental constraints in shortcuts to adiabaticity and illuminates the potential of underutilized phase spaces that have been traditionally overlooked.

TI Large Fluorescence Enhancement via Lossless All-Dielectric Spherical
   Mesocavities
SO ACS NANO
AB Nano- and microparticles are popular media to enhance optical signals, including fluorescence from a dye proximal to the particle. Here we show that homogeneous, lossless, all-dielectric spheres with diameters in the mesoscale range, between nano- (less than or similar to 100 nm) and micro- (greater than or similar to 1 mu m) scales, can offer surprisingly large fluorescence enhancements, up to F similar to 10(4). With the absence of nonradiative Ohmic losses inherent to plasmonic particles, we show that F can increase, decrease or even stay the same with increasing intrinsic quantum yield q(0), for suppressed, enhanced or intact radiative decay rates of a fluorophore, respectively. Further, the fluorophore may be located inside or outside the particle, providing additional flexibility and opportunities to design fit for purpose particles. The presented analysis with simple dielectric spheres should spur further interest in this less-explored scale of particles and experimental investigations to realize their potential for applications in imaging, molecular sensing, light coupling, and quantum information processing.

TI Hybrid metal halide perovskite magic-sized clusters, what's next?
SO NEXT MATERIALS
AB In recent years, hybrid metal halide perovskites (MHPs) materials have shown great potential application prospects in photovoltaics, catalysis, biomedicine, and quantum information technology due to their excellent optoelectronic properties. However, the toxicity and stability of intrinsic MHPs have restricted their development and widespread application. In the MHPs material system, perovskite magic-sized clusters (PMSCs) with extremely fast variations of tiny-aggregated atomic/molecular level polymers ranging from dozens to several hundreds of atoms or molecules, as multi-nuclear aggregates between microscopic atoms/molecules and macroscopic MHPs crystal materials, are the smallest structural system for studying the precise structure construction, electron structure and evolution rules, and related optoelectronic applications of the MHPs materials. At the atomic/molecular level, studying the mesoscale structure and evolution properties, synthesis methods, modification strategies, quantum effects and optoelectronic applications of PMSCs in multi-scale crystal material systems is crucial for exploring the structural evolution mechanism of MHPs, revealing the design principles of MHPs multifunctional coupling materials, and designing and developing new high-efficiency optoelectronic MHPs materials and related prototype devices.

TI Graph states and the variety of principal minors
SO ANNALI DI MATEMATICA PURA ED APPLICATA
AB In Quantum Information theory, graph states are quantum states defined by graphs. In this work we exhibit a correspondence between orbits of graph states and orbits in the variety of binary symmetric principal minors, under the action of SL(2, F-2)(xn) (sic) G(n). First we study the orbits of maximal abelian subgroups of the n-fold Pauli group under the action of C-n(loc) (sic) G(n), where C-n(loc) is the n-fold local Clifford group, and we show that this action corresponds to the natural action of SL(2, F-2)(xn) (sic) G(n) on the variety Z(n) subset of P(F-2(n2)) of principal minors of binary symmetric n x n matrices: the crucial step is in translating the action of SL(2, F-2)(xn) into an action of the local symplectic group Sp(2n)(loc)(F-2). We conclude by showing how the former action restricts onto stabilizer groups, stabilizer states and graph states.

TI Exceptions points with memory in a microcavity Brillouin laser
SO OPTICA
AB Exceptional points (EPs), universally present in non-Hermitian systems, often reveal some critical behaviors such as topological encircling chirality and ultrahigh enhanced sensing near such singularities. However, most of the experimental realizations of EPs have been limited to the linear regime, where system nonlinearity has been omitted. Here, we experimentally observe two distinct EPs with opposite hermiticities and demonstrate a parity-time phase transition with exotic memory effects near the EPs in a nonlinear and non-Hermitian system based on a stimulated Brillouin laser in an optical microcavity. The self-phase modulation induced nonlinearity effectively alters the EP location, surprisingly, in an asymmetric manner, resulting in a bistable memory effect. Moreover, two EPs with opposite hermiticities in the same system are found to show quite distinct behaviors in such a memory effect. This scheme completes the studies of non-Hermitian physics in a more general scenario by including nonlinearity and paves the way toward optical memory for all-optical signal processing and quantum information.

TI Two-Phonon Blockade in Quadratically Coupled Optomechanical Systems
SO PHOTONICS
AB We propose a scheme to realize the two-phonon blockade effect in a quadratically coupled optomechanical system. We consider the case that the optical cavity is simultaneously driven by a strong pumping field and a weak driving field. By strongly driving the optical cavity, the nonlinear interaction between the optical mode and the mechanical resonator can be significantly enhanced and an effective second-order nonlinearity between photons and phonons is induced. Based on this effectively strong nonlinearity, the two-phonon blockade effect can be achieved when a weak driving field is applied into the optical cavity. By contrast, we study the case of weakly driving the mechanical resonator. In this case, the single-phonon blockade is generated, while the two-phonon blockade cannot be observed. By numerically calculating the second-order and third-order correlation function, we investigate the statistical characteristics of phonons. In addition, we also study the influence of the thermal noise on the achieved two-phonon blockade effect. Our work provides an alternative approach for implementing multiphonon blockade and has potential applications in quantum information processing.

TI A Semiclassical Model for Plasmon-Exciton Interaction From Weak to

SO IEEE PHOTONICS JOURNAL
AB Exploitation of strong light-matter interactions in plasmonic systems is vital for both fundamental studies and the development of new applications, which enables exceptional physical phenomena and promotes potential applications in nanophotonics, information communication, and quantum information processing. Here, we present an analytic model of the interaction between localized surface plasmon resonances and excitons, where a semiclassical method is utilized. Two kinds of metal nanoparticles (nanosphere and nanoellipsoid) are considered in our study. We derive the relations between the plasmon-exciton coupling strength and the geometry and material parameters of the coupled systems when the nanoparticles are put in an excitonic medium, which give an important guide to achieve strong plasmon-exciton coupling. Rabi splittings and anticrossing behavior are also demonstrated in the calculated extinction spectra. Furthermore, we propose an analytic model to describe the strong coupling between excitons and plasmon in a core-shell nanorod structure which is widely used in experiments. Our study provides a simple yet rigorous prescription to both analyze and design plexcitonic systems aiming at strong light-matter interactions.

TI 532 nm silicon nitride optical phased array and high-speed calibration
   and control system
SO CHINESE OPTICS LETTERS
AB Integrated optoelectronic chips working in the visible spectrum range have promising applications in augmented reality and virtual reality, quantum information processing, biosensors, and more. A silicon nitride optical phased array (OPA) can shape and steer light to enable these applications on a compact chip without moving parts. However, smaller wavelength, wave-guide size, and the thermo-optic coefficient pose challenges in processing, calibration, and control of silicon nitride OPA chips. In this work, a high-speed phase control system for 532 nm silicon nitride OPA, utilizing a field programmable gate array and a digital-to-analog converter, achieves a 7.4 mu s voltage configuration. With this system, the single-shot multi-voltage optimization of beam calibration of the OPA for tens of milliseconds is realized, and the beam scanning in the range of +/- 24 degrees is demonstrated. The system fully meets the needs of high-speed scanning of silicon nitride OPA, advancing OPA's development and applications.

TI Synthesis of robust memory modes for linear quantum systems with unknown
   inputs
SO EPJ QUANTUM TECHNOLOGY
AB In this paper, the synthesis of robust memory modes for linear quantum passive systems in the presence of unknown inputs has been studied, aimed at facilitating secure storage and communication of quantum information. In particular, we can switch on decoherence-free (DF) modes in the storage stage by placing the poles on the imaginary axis via a coherent feedback control scheme, and these memory modes can further be simultaneously made robust against perturbations to the system parameters by minimizing the condition number associated with imaginary poles. The DF modes can also be switched off by tuning the controller parameters to place the poles in the left half of the complex plane in the writing/reading stage. We develop explicit algebraic conditions guiding the design of such a coherent quantum controller, which involves employing an augmented system model to counter the influence of unknown inputs. Examples are provided to illustrate the procedure of synthesizing robust memory modes for linear optical quantum systems.

TI Interplay of Electronic Orders in Topological Quantum Materials
SO ACS MATERIALS AU
AB Topological quantum materials hold great promise for future technological applications. Their unique electronic properties, such as protected surface states and exotic quasi-particles, offer opportunities for designing novel electronic and spintronics devices and allow quantum information processing. The origin of the interplay between various electronic orders in topological quantum materials, such as superconductivity and magnetism, remains unclear, particularly whether these electronic orders cooperate, compete, or simply coexist. Since the 2000s, the combination of topology and matter has sparked a tremendous surge of interest among theoreticians and experimentalists alike. Novel theoretical descriptions and predictions as well as complex experimental setups confirming or refuting these theories continuously appear in renowned journals. This review aims to provide conceptual tools to understand the fundamental concepts of this ever-growing field. Superconductivity and its historical development will serve as a second pillar alongside topological materials. While the main focus of this review is topological materials such as topological insulators and semimetals, topological superconductors will be explained phenomenologically.

TI Impact of substrates and quantum effects on exciton line shapes of 2D
   semiconductors at room temperature
SO NANOPHOTONICS
AB Exciton resonances in monolayer transition-metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) provide exceptionally strong light-matter interaction at room temperature. Their spectral line shape is critical in the design of a myriad of optoelectronic devices, ranging from solar cells to quantum information processing. However, disorder resulting from static inhomogeneities and dynamical fluctuations can significantly impact the line shape. Many recent works experimentally evaluate the optical properties of TMD monolayers placed on a substrate and the line shape is typically linked directly to the material's quality. Here, we highlight that the interference of the substrate and TMD reflections can strongly influence the line shape. We further show how basic, room-temperature reflection measurements allow investigation of the quantum mechanical exciton dynamics by systematically controlling the substrate reflection with index-matching oils. By removing the substrate contribution with properly chosen oil, we can extract the excitonic decay rates including the quantum mechanical dephasing rate. The results provide valuable guidance for the engineering of exciton line shapes in layered nanophotonic systems.

TI Mechanisms for nonlinear refractive index in organic cavity polaritons
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
AB The nonlinear optical response of organic polaritonic matter has received increasing attention due to their enhanced and controllable nonlinear response and their potential for novel optical devices such as compact photon sources and optical and quantum information devices. Using z scans at different wavelengths and incident powers we have studied the nonlinear optical dispersion of ultrastrongly coupled organic cavity polaritons near the lower polariton band. We show that the up to 150-fold enhancement of the nonlinear response compared to a cavityless organic film arises from an intensity-dependent polaritonic resonant frequency shift ("blueshift"). Consequently, we find that these z-scan data can only be described by several terms of a power series expansion in intensity whose respective contributions depend on power broadening and detuning from the lower polariton band. We further show that the nonlinear response can be quantitatively described by a semiclassical three-level molecular model coupled to the cavity in which saturation reduces the Rabi splitting, thus accounting for the lower polariton band's observed blueshift.

TI Tightly Focused Characteristics of Eccentric Spatiotemporal Optical
   Vortex
SO LASER & OPTOELECTRONICS PROGRESS
AB The eccentric spatiotemporal optical vortex is a new type of optical pulse wave packet in which the spatiotemporal vortex and the spatial vortex are not concentric. Since parameters can be introduced to change the central position of the optical vortex, it provides new opportunities for controlling pulsed optical beams. Based on the diffraction integral formula and a preprocessing method, we present the intensities and phase distributions of eccentric double vortex and eccentric triple vortex after tight focusing by a high numerical aperture lens. The research results show that spatiotemporal coupling occurs in the focal field of the focused spatiotemporal wave packet, and the phase singularity changes, thereby affecting the intensity distribution and stability of the beam. The phase singularity in the spatiotemporal and spatial domains can be flexibly controlled by changing the eccentric parameters. This tightly focused eccentric spatiotemporal vortex wave packet not only provides a theoretical basis for studying the distribution properties of complex spatiotemporal optical fields, but also has potential applications in light-matter interactions, quantum information processing, and optical micromanipulation.

TI Multifunctional metasurface coding for visible vortex beam generation,
   deflection and focusing
SO NANOPHOTONICS
AB Vortex beams, as beams carrying orbital angular momentum (OAM), exhibit unique donut-shaped intensity distributions and helical wavefronts. They are widely applied in fields such as optical communication, nanoparticle manipulation, and quantum information. Traditional vortex beam generation methods, such as those based on Pancharatnam-Berry phase design, can effectively generate vortex beams, but the conversion efficiency and design flexibility are limited by polarization states and incident angles. In addition, the generated and propagated vortex beams require separate metasurface for wavefront deflection and refocusing for practical applications. This work proposes a novel metasurface design approach based on resonant phase, where phase coverage of 2 pi is achieved by varying the radius of the nanocylinders. In addition to the efficient vortex beam generation in the visible regime, we have tackled the challenge of simultaneous control of vortex beam's anomalous deflection and refocusing, through different encoding sequences superimposed based on the principle of Fourier convolution and metalens design. This all-in-one multifunctional metasurface design offers new technological pathways for secure optical communication and quantum manipulation applications.

TI Nanocavity-based quantum-dot single-photon source on a SiN waveguide
   integrated by transfer printing
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB Silicon nitride (SiN) integrated photonics is a highly promising platform for photonic quantum information processing. However, the efficient generation of single photons remains a significant challenge. Epitaxial InAs/GaAs quantum dots (QDs) embedded in wavelength-scale nanocavities offer a promising solution as single-photon sources (SPSs), but their integration with SiN has not yet been demonstrated. In this work, we employed a photonic crystal (PhC) nanobeam cavity to realize a QD SPS on a SiN waveguide. We found that the second-order mode of a period-modulated PhC nanobeam cavity is located close to the waveguide mode in the momentum space and could present a way to efficiently couple photons from the QD SPS into the waveguide. We fabricated the SiN circuitry and QD SPSs separately and integrated the SPS onto the waveguide by transfer printing. We observed Purcell enhancement by the cavity and confirmed the coupling of single photons into the waveguide.

TI Confinement of excited states in two-dimensional, in-plane, quantum
   heterostructures
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Two-dimensional (2D) semiconductors are promising candidates for optoelectronic application and quantum information processes due to their inherent out-of-plane 2D confinement. In addition, they offer the possibility of achieving low-dimensional in-plane exciton confinement, similar to zero-dimensional quantum dots, with intriguing optical and electronic properties via strain or composition engineering. However, realizing such laterally confined 2D monolayers and systematically controlling size-dependent optical properties remain significant challenges. Here, we report the observation of lateral confinement of excitons in epitaxially grown in-plane MoSe2 quantum dots (similar to 15-60 nm wide) inside a continuous matrix of WSe2 monolayer film via a sequential epitaxial growth process. Various optical spectroscopy techniques reveal the size-dependent exciton confinement in the MoSe2 monolayer quantum dots with exciton blue shift (12-40 meV) at a low temperature as compared to continuous monolayer MoSe2. Finally, single-photon emission (g(2)(0) - 0.4) was also observed from the smallest dots at 1.6 K. Our study opens the door to compositionally engineered, tunable, in-plane quantum light sources in 2D semiconductors.

TI Hyperpolarization of nuclear spins: Polarization blockade
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Efficient hyperpolarization of nuclear spins via optically active defect centers, such as the nitrogen vacancy (NV) center in diamond, has great potential for enhancing NMR-based quantum information processing and nanoscale magnetic resonance imaging. Recently, pulse-based protocols have been shown to efficiently transfer optically induced polarization of the electron defect spin to surrounding nuclear spins-at particular resonant pulse intervals. In this work, we investigate the performance of these protocols, both analytically and experimentally, with the electronic spin of a single NV defect. We find that whenever polarization resonances of nuclear spins are near degenerate with a "blocking" spin, which is single spin with stronger off-diagonal coupling to the electronic central spin, they are displaced out of the central resonant region-without, in general, significant weakening in the rate of polarization. We analyze the underlying physical mechanism and obtain a closed-form expression for the displacement. We propose that spin blocking represents a common but overlooked effect in hyperpolarization of nuclear spins and suggest solutions for improved protocol performance in the presence of (naturally occurring) blocking nuclear spins.

TI Transport through a nodal surface semimetal-superconductor junction in
   absence/presence of light irradiation
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICS-CONDENSED MATTER
AB We study quantum tunneling via s-wave superconductor (SC) junction with a topologically charged nodal surface semimetal (NSSM) where a nonsymmorphic symmetry forces the nodal surfaces to stick to the Brillouin zone boundary. Due to their unique dispersions close to the two dimensional band crossing, the charge carriers in the NSSM display many unorthodox behavior in the nature of Andreev as well as normal reflections at the SC junction interface. We investigate such behaviors for different incident orientations for both subgap and supergap energies where monotonic decays/rises of reflectance with incident energy or angle of incidences are often not followed. We also consider irradiation via light with circular and linear polarization on such systems following a Floquet approach in the limit of high frequency irradiation and probe the stroboscopic temporal evolution of the transport parameters. Our results indicate many nontrivial Andreev transport features including near-depletion of the subgap conductivities. All these nontrivialities can be tested in a cold atom set-up on optical lattices and well experimented for quantum information processing purpose.

TI Ultrafast nano-imaging of dark excitons
SO NATURE PHOTONICS
AB Understanding the impact of spatial heterogeneity on the behaviour of two-dimensional materials represents one of the grand challenges in applying these materials in optoelectronics and quantum information science. For transition metal dichalcogenide heterostructures in particular, direct access to heterogeneities in the dark-exciton landscape with nanometre spatial and ultrafast time resolution is highly desired but remains largely elusive. Here we report how ultrafast dark-field momentum microscopy can spatio-temporally resolve dark-exciton formation dynamics in a twisted WSe2/MoS2 heterostructure with a time resolution of 55 fs and a spatial resolution of 480 nm. This enables us to directly map spatial heterogeneity in the electronic and excitonic structure, and to correlate this with the dark-exciton formation and relaxation dynamics. The advantage of the simultaneous ultrafast nanoscale dark-field momentum microscopy and spectroscopy reported here is that it enables spatio-temporal imaging of the photoemission spectral function that carries energy- and momentum-resolved information on the single-particle band structure, many-body interactions and correlation phenomena.

TI Dynamic modulated single-photon routing
SO CHINESE PHYSICS B
AB The dynamic control of single-photon scattering in a pair of one-dimensional waveguides mediated by a time-modulated atom-cavity system is investigated. Two cases, where the waveguides are coupled symmetrically or asymmetrically to the atom-cavity system, are discussed in detail. The results show that such time-modulated atom-cavity configuration can behave as a dynamical tunable directional single-photon router. The photons with different frequencies can dynamically be routed from the incident waveguide into any ports of the other with a 100% probability via adjusting the modulated amplitude or phases of the time-modulated atom-cavity coupling strengths, associate with the help of the asymmetrical waveguide-cavity couplings. Furthermore, the influence of dissipation on the routing capability is investigated. It is shown that the present single-photon router is robust against the dissipative process of the system, especially the atomic dissipation. These results are expected to be applicable in quantum information processing and design quantum devices with dynamical modulation.

TI Efficient coupling between free electrons and the supermode of a silicon
   slot waveguide
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB Laser light can modulate the kinetic energy spectrum of free electrons and induce extremely high acceleration gradients, which are instrumental to electron microscopy and electron acceleration, respectively. We present a design scheme for a silicon photonic slot waveguide which hosts a supermode to interact with free electrons. The efficiency of this interaction relies on the coupling strength per photon along the interaction length. We predict an optimum value of 0.4266, resulting in the maximum energy gain of 28.27 keV for an optical pulse energy of only 0.22 nJ and duration 1 ps. The acceleration gradient is 1.05 GeV/m, which is lower than the maximum imposed by the damage threshold of Si waveguides. Our scheme shows how the coupling efficiency and energy gain can be maximized without maximizing the acceleration gradient. It highlights the potential of silicon photonics technology in hosting electron-photon interactions with direct applications in free-electron acceleration, radiation sources, and quantum information science.& COPY; 2023 Optica Publishing Group under the terms of the Optica Open Access Publishing Agreement

TI Nano-beam clamping revisited
SO JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYSICS
AB Within recent years, the field of nano-mechanics has diversified in a variety of applications, ranging from quantum information processing to biological molecules recognition. Among the diversity of devices produced these days, the simplest (but versatile) element remains the doubly clamped beam: it can store very large tensile stresses (producing high resonance frequencies f0 and quality factors Q), is interfaceable with electric setups (by means of conductive layers), and can be produced easily in clean rooms (with scalable designs, including multiplexing). Besides, its mechanical properties are the simplest to describe. Resonance frequencies and Qs are being modeled, with as specific achievement the ultrahigh quality resonances based on "soft clamping" and "phonon shields." Here, we demonstrate that the fabrication undercut of the clamping regions of basic nano-beams produces "natural soft clamping," given for free. We present the analytic theory that enables to fit experimental data, which can be used for {Q, f(0)} design: beyond finite element modeling validation, the presented expressions provide a profound understanding of the phenomenon, with both Q enhancement and a downward frequency shift.

TI Investigation of photon emitters in Ce-implanted hexagonal boron nitride
SO OPTICAL MATERIALS EXPRESS
AB Color centers in hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) are presently attracting broad interest as a novel platform for nanoscale sensing and quantum information processing. Unfortunately, their atomic structures remain largely elusive and only a small percentage of the emitters studied thus far have the properties required to serve as optically addressable spin qubits. Here, we use confocal fluorescence microscopy at variable temperatures to study a new class of point defects produced via cerium ion implantation in thin hBN flakes. We find that, to a significant fraction, emitters show bright room-temperature emission, and good optical stability suggesting the formation of Ce-based point defects. Using density functional theory (DFT) we calculate the emission properties of candidate emitters, and single out the CeVB center-formed by an interlayer Ce atom adjacent to a boron vacancy-as one possible microscopic model. Our results suggest an intriguing route to defect engineering that simultaneously exploits the singular properties of rare-earth ions and the versatility of two-dimensional material hosts.

TI Single-hole couplings in GaAs/AlGaAs double dots probed with transport
   and EDSR spectroscopy
SO APPLIED PHYSICS LETTERS
AB We report a detailed study of the tunnel barriers within a single-hole GaAs/AlGaAs double quantum dot device (DQD). For quantum information applications as well as fundamental studies, careful tuning and reliable measurements of the barriers are important requirements. In order to tune a DQD device adequately into the single-hole electric dipole spin resonance regime, one has to employ a variety of techniques to cover the extended range of tunnel couplings. In this work, we demonstrate four separate techniques, based upon charge sensing, quantum transport, time-resolved pulsing, and electron dipole spin resonance spectroscopy to determine the couplings as a function of relevant gate voltages and magnetic field. Measurements were performed under conditions of both symmetric and asymmetric tunnel couplings to the leads. Good agreement was observed between different techniques when measured under the same conditions. The results indicate that even in this relatively simple circuit, the requirement to tune multiple gates and the consequences of real potential profiles result in non-intuitive dependencies of the couplings as a function of the plunger gate voltage and the magnetic field.

TI Continuous-variable entanglement in a two-mode lossy cavity: An analytic
   solution
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Continuous-variable (CV) entanglement is a valuable resource in the field of quantum information. One source of CV entanglement is the correlations between the position and momentum of photons in a two-mode squeezed state of light. In this paper, we theoretically study the generation of squeezed states, via spontaneous parametric down conversion, inside a two-mode lossy cavity that is pumped with a classical optical pulse. The dynamics of the density operator in the cavity is modeled using the Lindblad master equation, and we show that the solution to this model is the density operator for a two-mode squeezed thermal state, with a time-dependent squeezing amplitude and average thermal photon number for each mode. We derive an expression for the minimum correlation variance inside the cavity that depends crucially on the difference in the losses between the two modes. We apply our analytic solution to the important example of a microring resonator that is pumped with a Gaussian pulse. The expressions that we derive will help researchers optimize CV entanglement in lossy cavities.

TI CMOS-Compatible Ultrathin Superconducting NbN Thin Films Deposited by
   Reactive Ion Sputtering on 300 mm Si Wafer
SO MATERIALS
AB We report a milestone in achieving large-scale, ultrathin (similar to 5 nm) superconducting NbN thin films on 300 mm Si wafers using a high-volume manufacturing (HVM) industrial physical vapor deposition (PVD) system. The NbN thin films possess remarkable structural uniformity and consistently high superconducting quality across the entire 300 mm Si wafer, by incorporating an AlN buffer layer. High-resolution X-ray diffraction and transmission electron microscopy analyses unveiled enhanced crystallinity of (111)-oriented delta-phase NbN with the AlN buffer layer. Notably, NbN films deposited on AlN-buffered Si substrates exhibited a significantly elevated superconducting critical temperature (similar to 2 K higher for the 10 nm NbN) and a higher upper critical magnetic field or H-c2 (34.06 T boost in H-c2 for the 50 nm NbN) in comparison with those without AlN. These findings present a promising pathway for the integration of quantum-grade superconducting NbN films with the existing 300 mm CMOS Si platform for quantum information applications.

TI Bundle theoretic descriptions of massless single-particle state spaces;
   how do we perceive a moving quantum particle
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICS A-MATHEMATICAL AND THEORETICAL
AB Recently, a bundle theoretic description of massive single-particle state spaces, which is better suited for Relativistic Quantum Information Theory than the ordinary Hilbert space description, has been suggested. However, the mathematical framework presented in that work does not apply to massless particles. It is because, unlike massive particles, massless particles cannot assume the zero momentum state and hence the mass shell associated with massless particles has non-trivial cohomology. To overcome this difficulty, this paper suggests a new framework that can be applied to massless particles. Applications to the cases of massless particles with spin-1 and 2, namely photon and graviton, will reveal that the field equations, the gauge conditions, and the gauge freedoms of Electromagnetism and General Relativity naturally arise as manifestations of an inertial observer's perception of the internal quantum states of a photon and a graviton, respectively. Finally, we show that gauge freedom is exhibited by all massless particles, except those with spin-0 and 1/2.

TI Quantum structured light in high dimensions
SO APL PHOTONICS
AB Structured light has become topical of late, where controlling light in all its degrees of freedom has offered novel states of light long predicted, enhanced functionality in applications, and a modern toolbox for probing fundamental science. Structuring light as single photons and entangled states allows the spatial modes of light to be used to encode a large alphabet, accessing high dimensional Hilbert spaces for fundamental tests of quantum mechanics and improved quantum information processing tasks. In this tutorial, we outline the basic concepts of high dimensional quantum states expressed in a basis of spatial modes (structured light) and explain how to create, control, and detect such quantum states in the laboratory with a focus on transverse spatial modes such as the orbital angular momentum and pixel (position) modes. Finally, we highlight some example applications of such quantum structured light, from communications to imaging. (c) 2023 Author(s).

TI Ultrafast ID - VG Technique for
   Reliable Cryogenic Device Characterization
SO IEEE JOURNAL OF THE ELECTRON DEVICES SOCIETY
AB An in-depth understanding of the transient operation of devices at cryogenic temperatures remains experimentally elusive. However, the impact of these transients has recently become important in efforts to develop both electronics to support quantum information science as well as cryogenic high-performance computing. In this paper, we discuss a fast time-dependent device characterization technique, capable of examining the charge trapping dynamics of devices operating at cryogenic temperatures. Careful calibrations allow for the acquisition of accurate fast I-V and transconductance transients down to 20 ns for devices operating down to 8 K. The trap charging dynamics was monitored via shifts in both threshold voltage and transconductance. The combination of fast measurements and cold temperatures were used to shift the observable measurement window to reveal charge trapping/de-trapping time dynamics of both fast and slow traps in high-k devices to demonstrate the utility of the fast I-V for cryogenic device characterization.

TI Novel Nanotube Multiquantum Dot Devices
SO NANO LETTERS
AB Addressable quantum states well isolated from the environment are of considerable interest for quantum information science and technology. Carbon nanotubes are an appealing system, since a perfect crystal can be grown without any missing atoms and its cylindrical structure prevents ill-defined atomic arrangement at the surface. Here, we develop a reliable process to fabricate compact multielectrode circuits that can sustain the harsh conditions of the nanotube growth. Nanotubes are suspended over multiple gate electrodes, which are themselves structured over narrow dielectric ridges to reduce the effect of the charge fluctuators of the substrate. We measure high-quality double-and triple-quantum dot charge stability diagrams. Transport measurements through the triple-quantum dot indicate long-range tunneling of single electrons between the left and right quantum dots. This work paves the way to the realization of a new generation of condensed-matter devices in an ultraclean environment, including spin qubits, mechanical qubits, and quantum simulators.

TI Probing the edge between integrability and quantum chaos in interacting
   few-atom systems
SO QUANTUM
AB Interacting quantum systems in the chaotic domain are at the core of various ongoing studies of many-body physics, ranging from the scrambling of quantum information to the onset of thermalization. We propose a minimum model for chaos that can be experimentally realized with cold atoms trapped in onedimensional multi-well potentials. We explore the emergence of chaos as the number of particles is increased, starting with as few as two, and as the number of wells is increased, ranging from a double well to a multi-well Kronig-Penney-like system. In this way, we illuminate the narrow boundary between integrability and chaos in a highly tunable few-body system. We show that the competition between the particle interactions and the periodic structure of the confining potential reveals subtle indications of quantum chaos for 3 particles, while for 4 particles stronger signatures are seen. The analysis is performed for bosonic particles and could also be extended to distinguishable fermions.

TI Flexible generation of OAM mode reconfigurable beams and spinning OAM
   beams based on active induced magnetism Huygens' metasurface
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB Orbital angular momentum (OAM) beams have demonstrated significant potential in the fields of communication, imaging and quantum information science. In particular, active OAM metasurfaces enable flexible and on-demand control of OAM beams without altering their structures, significantly enriching the applications of OAM beams. However, due to the limitations of electrode wiring and unit structure efficiency, most existing active metasurface designs are reflective, hindering the further development of this field. Here, we propose an active induced magnetism Huygens' metasurface to overcome these limitations. We demonstrate that transmissive and high-efficiency OAM mode reconfigurable beams of topological charge l = - 1 or l = + 1, as well as spatiotemporally modulated spinning OAM harmonic beam of topological charge l = + 1 can be generated on-demand. The findings of this study provide a novel approach to achieve more flexible and diversified OAM beamforming, addressing the evolving demands of various OAM-related applications.

TI Fast adiabatic transport of single laser-cooled
   9Be+ ions in a cryogenic Penning trap stack
SO EUROPEAN PHYSICAL JOURNAL PLUS
AB High precision mass and g-factor measurements in Penning traps have enabled groundbreaking tests of fundamental physics. The most advanced setups use multi-trap methods, which employ transport of particles between specialized trap zones. Present developments focused on the implementation of sympathetic laser cooling will enable significantly shorter duty cycles and better accuracies in many of these scenarios. To take full advantage of these increased capabilities, we implement fast adiabatic transport concepts developed in the context of trapped-ion quantum information processing in a cryogenic Penning trap system. We show adiabatic transport of a single Be-9(+) ion initially cooled to 2 mK over a 2.2-cm distance within 15 ms and with less than 10 mK energy gain at a peak velocity of 3 m/s. These results represent an important step towards the implementation of quantum logic spectroscopy in the (anti-)proton system. Applying these developments to other multi-trap systems has the potential to considerably increase the data-sampling rate in these experiments.

TI Metasurfaces for generating higher-order Poincaré beams by
   polarization-selective focusing and overall elimination of
   co-polarization components
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB Focused higher-order Poincare (HOP) beams are of particular interest because they facilitate understanding the exotic properties of structured light and their applications in classical physics and quantum information. However, generating focused HOP beams using metasurfaces is challenging. In this study, we proposed a metasurface design comprising two sets of metal nanoslits for generating coaxially focused HOP beams. The nanoslits were interleaved on equispaced alternating rings. The initial rings started at the two adjacent Fresnel zones to provide opposite propagation phases for overall elimination of the co-polarization components. With the designed hyperbolic and helical profiles of the geometric phases, the two vortices of the opposite cross-circular-polarizations were formed and selectively focused, realizing HOP beams of improved quality. Simulations and experimental results demonstrated the feasibility of the proposed metasurface design. This study is of significance in the integration of miniaturized optical devices and enriches the application areas of metasurfaces.(c) 2023 Optica Publishing Group under the terms of the Optica Open Access Publishing Agreement

TI Tunable magnomechanically induced transparency and fast-slow light in a
   hybrid cavity magnomechanical system
SO CHINESE PHYSICS B
AB We theoretically explore the tunability of magnomechanically induced transparency (MMIT) phenomenon and fast-slow light effect in a hybrid cavity magnomechanical system in which a high-quality yttrium iron garnet (YIG) sphere and an atomic ensemble are placed inside a microwave cavity. In the probe output spectrum, we can observe magnon-induced transparency (MIT) and MMIT due to the photon-magnon and phonon-magnon couplings. We further investigate the effect of atomic ensemble on the absorption spectrum. The results show that better transparency can be obtained by choosing appropriate atomic ensemble parameters. We give an explicit explanation for the mechanism of the Fano resonance phenomenon. Moreover, we discuss phenomena of slow-light propagation. The maximum group delay increases significantly with the increasing atom-cavity coupling strength, and the conversion between slow light and fast light can also be achieved by adjusting the atom-cavity coupling strength. These results may have potential applications for quantum information processing and high precision measurements.

TI Geometry of Krylov complexity
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB We develop a geometric approach to operator growth and Krylov complexity in many-body quantum systems governed by symmetries. We start by showing a direct link between a unitary evolution with the Liouvillian and the displacement operator of appropriate generalized coherent states. This connection maps operator growth to a purely classical motion in phase space. The phase spaces are endowed with a natural information metric. We show that, in this geometry, operator growth is represented by geodesics, and Krylov complexity is proportional to a volume. This geometric perspective also provides two novel avenues toward computation of Lanczos coefficients, and it sheds new light on the origin of their maximal growth. We describe the general idea and analyze it in explicit examples, among which we reproduce known results from the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev model, derive operator growth based on SU(2) and Heisenberg-Weyl symmetries, and generalize the discussion to conformal field theories. Finally, we use techniques from quantum optics to study operator evolution with quantum information tools such as entanglement and Renyi entropies, negativity, fidelity, relative entropy, and capacity of entanglement.

TI Stable iPEPO Tensor-Network Algorithm for Dynamics of Two-Dimensional
   Open Quantum Lattice Models
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW X
AB Being able to accurately describe the dynamics steady states of driven and/or dissipative but quantum correlated lattice models is of fundamental importance in many areas of science: from quantum information to biology. An efficient numerical simulation of large open systems in two spatial dimensions is a challenge. In this work, we develop a tensor network method, based on an infinite projected entangled pair operator ansatz, applicable directly in the thermodynamic limit. We incorporate techniques of finding optimal truncations of enlarged network bonds by optimizing an objective function appropriate for open systems. Comparisons with numerically exact calculations, both for the dynamics and the steady state, demonstrate the power of the method. In particular, we consider dissipative transverse quantum Ising, driven-dissipative hard-core boson, and dissipative anisotropic XY models in non-mean-field limits, proving able to capture substantial entanglement in the presence of dissipation. Our method enables us to study regimes that are accessible to current experiments but lie well beyond the applicability of existing techniques.

TI A TES single-photon detector demonstrating high-energy-resolution, high
   efficiency, and ultra-low dark counts near 0.9
   Tc
SO APL PHOTONICS
AB Transition-edge sensors (TESs) are among the most promising technologies for single-photon detection, offering high quantum efficiency, low dark count rates, and energy-resolving capabilities. However, optimal TES performance typically requires ultra-low temperatures below 100 mK, necessitating bulky dilution refrigerators or adiabatic demagnetization refrigerators, which limits their practical deployment. In this work, we demonstrate a titanium-based TES optimized for 1064 nm photon detection that achieves high performance at an elevated bath temperature of 220 mK-approximately 90% of its superconducting transition temperature, making it compatible with more compact sorption refrigerators. Through the integration of an optical cavity, a detailed complex impedance and noise characterization, and a systematic investigation of dark count sources, the detector achieves a system detection efficiency exceeding 97%, an energy resolution of 240 meV, and an intrinsic dark count rate as low as 2 x 10(-4 )cps. These findings significantly expand the applicability of TES single-photon detectors to practical photon-counting systems, such as quantum information and infrared astronomy.

TI Tractable protocol for detection-loophole-free Bell tests over long
   distances
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Certifying genuine nonclassical correlations over long distances is essential for device-independent quantum information. In photonic platforms, however, this remains challenging due to photon loss, which opens the detection loophole, rendering violations increasingly difficult for less-efficient detectors. Eberhard showed that using nonmaximally entangled states lowers the detection-efficiency threshold to 66.7%, but existing photonic approaches are restricted to short distances with linear transmittance scaling. Conversely, single-photon event-ready schemes extend the distance with favorable square-root scaling with channel transmittance, yet still demand detection efficiencies above 82.6%. Here, we propose the first all-photonic, heralded entanglement distribution protocol that unifies these two advances: It achieves a postselection-free violation at the Eberhard limit while preserving twin-field-like scaling. We identify the loss independent of the vacuum component amplitude of the prepared state as the source of this enhancement. Our approach addresses both resilience to loss and scalability, providing a practical route toward long-distance, loophole-free Bell tests and device-independent applications with current technology.

TI Asymmetrically Nonlinear Generation of Optical Orbital Angular Momentum
   via Cooperation of Bragg Diffraction and Birefringent Phase Matching
SO LASER & PHOTONICS REVIEWS
AB Nonlinear interaction between orbital angular momentum (OAM) of light and materials is crucial both for revealing novel physical phenomena and advancing high-capacity classical and quantum information technologies. However, previous studies have primarily concentrated on the nonlinear generation of OAM beams or their nonlinear conversion. In this work, a flexible and integral approach for generating and manipulating nonlinear OAM beams is proposed, facilitated by the cooperation of polarization-dependent linear Bragg diffraction and birefringent phase matching within a single lithium niobate crystal. These experimental results demonstrate that this combined mechanism enables the asymmetric production and modulation of second-harmonic OAM beams by altering the interaction sequence. The nonlinear conversion efficiency reaches the order of 10-2 W-1 while the topological charge exceeds 10. This work presents a novel method to generate and control nonlinear OAM beams in a single nonlinear crystal, which can be utilized for the detection of OAM states at infrared wavelengths or to demonstrate high-dimensional entanglement.

TI Interdisciplinary advances in microcombs: bridging physics and
   information technology
SO ELIGHT
AB The advancement of microcomb sources, which serve as a versatile and powerful platform for various time-frequency measurements, have spurred widespread interest across disciplines. Their uses span coherent optical and microwave communications, atomic clocks, high-precision LiDARs, spectrometers, and frequency synthesizers. Recent breakthroughs in fabricating optical micro-cavities, along with the excitation and control of microcombs, have broadened their applications, bridging the gap between physical exploration and practical engineering systems. These developments pave the way for pioneering approaches in both classical and quantum information sciences. In this review article, we conduct a thorough examination of the latest strategies related to microcombs, their enhancement and functionalization schemes, and cutting-edge applications that cover signal generation, data transmission, quantum analysis, and information gathering, processing and computation. Additionally, we provide in-depth evaluations of microcomb-based methodologies tailored for a variety of applications. To conclude, we consider the current state of research and suggest a prospective roadmap that could transition microcomb technology from laboratory settings to broader real-world applications.

TI Strategies for single-shot discrimination of process matrices
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB The topic of causality has recently gained traction quantum information research. This work examines the problem of single-shot discrimination between process matrices which are an universal method defining a causal structure. We provide an exact expression for the optimal probability of correct distinction. In addition, we present an alternative way to achieve this expression by using the convex cone structure theory. We also express the discrimination task as semidefinite programming. Due to that, we have created the SDP calculating the distance between process matrices and we quantify it in terms of the trace norm. As a valuable by-product, the program finds an optimal realization of the discrimination task. We also find two classes of process matrices which can be distinguished perfectly. Our main result, however, is a consideration of the discrimination task for process matrices corresponding to quantum combs. We study which strategy, adaptive or non-signalling, should be used during the discrimination task. We proved that no matter which strategy you choose, the probability of distinguishing two process matrices being a quantum comb is the same.

TI Information retrieval and criticality in high-dimensional
   parity-time-symmetric systems
SO ACTA PHYSICA SINICA
AB Recently, impressive progress has been made in the study of non-Hermitian systems with parity-time symmetry, such as observations of topological properties of physical systems and criticality at exceptionalpoints. A crucial aspect of parity-time symmetric nonunitary dynamics is the information flow between thesystem and the environment. In this paper, we use the physical quantity, distinguishability between quantumstates, to uniformly quantify the information flow between low-dimensional and high-dimensional parity-timesymmetric non-Hermitian systems and environments. The numerical results show that the oscillation ofquantum state distinguishability and complete information retrieval and can be obtained in the parity-time-unbroken phase. However, the information decays exponentially in the parity-time-broken phase. Theexceptional point marks the criticality between reversibility and irreversibility of information flow, and thedistinguishability between quantum states exhibits the behavior of power-law decay. Understanding theseunique phenomena in nonunitary quantum dynamics provides an important perspective for the study of openquantum systems and contributes to their application in quantum information

TI Irreversible entropy production: From classical to quantum
SO REVIEWS OF MODERN PHYSICS
AB Entropy production is a key quantity in any finite-time thermodynamic process. It is intimately tied with the fundamental laws of thermodynamics, embodying a tool to extend thermodynamic considerations all the way to nonequilibrium processes. It is also often used in attempts to provide the quantitative characterization of logical and thermodynamic irreversibility, stemming from processes in physics, chemistry, and biology. Notwithstanding its fundamental character, a unifying theory of entropy production valid for general processes, both classical and quantum, has not yet been formulated. Developments pivoting around the frameworks of stochastic thermodynamics, open quantum systems, and quantum information theory have led to substantial progress in such endeavors. This has culminated in the unlocking of a new generation of experiments able to address stochastic thermodynamic processes and the impact of entropy production on them. This review aims to provide a compendium on the current framework for the description, assessment, and manipulation of entropy production. Formal aspects of its formulation and the implications stemming from the potential quantum nature of a given process, including a detailed survey of recent experiments, are both presented.

TI Machine-learning-assisted electron-spin readout of nitrogen-vacancy
   center in diamond
SO APPLIED PHYSICS LETTERS
AB Machine learning is a powerful tool in finding hidden data patterns for quantum information processing. Here, we introduce this method into the optical readout of electron-spin states in diamond via single-photon collection and demonstrate improved readout precision at room temperature. The traditional method of summing photon counts in a time gate loses all the timing information crudely. We find that changing the gate width can only optimize the contrast or the state variance, not both. In comparison, machine learning adaptively learns from time-resolved fluorescence data and offers the optimal data processing model that elaborately weights each time bin to maximize the extracted information. It is shown that our method can repair the processing result from imperfect data, reducing 7% in spin readout error while optimizing the contrast. Note that these improvements only involve recording photon time traces and consume no additional experimental time, and they are, thus, robust and free. Our machine learning method implies a wide range of applications in the precision measurement and optical detection of states.

TI On the Philosophical Standpoint of a Recent Mathematical Color
   Perception Model
SO FOUNDATIONS OF SCIENCE
AB The problem of explaining color perception has fascinated painters, philosophers and scientists throughout the history. In many cases, the ideas and discoveries about color perception in one of these categories influenced the others, thus resulting in one of the most remarkable cross-fertilization of human thought. At the end of the nineteenth century, two models stood out as the most convincing ones: Young-Helmholtz's trichromacy on one side, and Hering's opponency on the other side. The former was mainly supported by painters and scientists, although with some noticeable exceptions as, e.g., Otto Runge, while the majority of philosophers supported the latter. These two apparently incompatible models were proven to be two complementary parts of the hugely complex chain of events which leads to human color perception. Recently, a rigorous mathematical theory able to incorporate both trichromacy and opponency has been developed thanks to the use of the language and tools of quantum information. In this paper, we discuss the placement of this model within the philosophical theories about color.

TI Optomechanical ring resonator for efficient microwave-optical frequency
   conversion
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Phonons traveling in solid-state devices are emerging as a universal excitation for coupling different physical systems. Phonons at microwave frequencies have a similar wavelength to optical photons in solids, enabling optomechanical microwave-optical transduction of classical and quantum signals. It becomes conceivable to build optomechanical integrated circuits (OMIC) that guide both photons and phonons and interconnect photonic and phononic devices. Here, we demonstrate an OMIC including an optomechanical ring resonator (OMR), where co-resonant infrared photons and GHz phonons induce significantly enhanced interconversion. The platform is hybrid, using wide bandgap semiconductor gallium phosphide (GaP) for waveguiding and piezoelectric zinc oxide (ZnO) for phonon generation. The OMR features photonic and phononic quality factors of >1 x 10(5) and 3.2 x 103, respectively. The optomechanical interconversion between photonic modes achieved an internal conversion efficiency eta(i )= (2.1 +/- 0.1)% and a total device efficiency eta(tot )= 0.57x10(-6) at a low acoustic pump power of 1.6 mW. The efficient conversion in OMICs enables microwave-optical transduction for quantum information and microwave photonics applications.

SO CHEMICAL SCIENCE
AB Photoinduced electron spin polarization (ESP) of a spin-1/2 organic radical (nitronyl nitroxide, NN) in a series of Pt(ii) complexes comprised of 4,4 & PRIME;-di-tert-butyl-2,2 & PRIME;-bipyridine (bpy) and 3-tert-butylcatecholate (CAT) ligands, where the CAT ligand is substituted with (CH3)n-meta-phenyl-NN (bridge-NN) groups, is presented and discussed. We show the importance of attenuating the energy gap between localized NN radical and chromophoric excited states to control both the magnitude and sign of the optically-generated ESP, and to provide deeper insight into the details of the ESP mechanism. Understanding electronic structure contributions to optically generated ESP will enhance our ability to control the nature of prepared states for a variety of quantum information science applications, where strong ESP facilitates enhanced sensitivity and readout capabilities at low applied magnetic fields and higher temperatures.
   Different excited state equilibration pathways yield ground-state electron spin polarization of radical-elaborated platinum(ii) complexes. The equilibration pathways are controlled through designed molecular conformation.

TI Two-Photon Interference from a Quantum Emitter in Hexagonal Boron
   Nitride
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW APPLIED
AB Recently discovered quantum emitters in 2D materials have opened new prospects for integrated photonic devices for quantum information. Most of these applications require the emitted photons to be indistinguishable, which has remained elusive in 2D materials. Here we investigate two-photon interference of a quantum emitter generated in hexagonal boron nitride with use of an electron beam. We measure the correlations of zero-phonon-line photons in a Hong-Ou-Mandel interferometer under nonresonant excitation. We find that the emitted photons exhibit a partial indistinguishability of 0.44 +/- 0.11 in a 3-ns time window, which corresponds to a corrected value of 0.56 +/- 0.11 after imperfect emitter purity has been accounting for. The dependence of the Hong-Ou-Mandel visibility on the width of the postselection time window allows us to estimate the dephasing time of the emitter to be approximately 1.5 ns, about half the limit set by spontaneous emission. A visibility greater than 90% is within reach with use of the Purcell effect with current 2D-material photonics.

TI Tunable Transparency and Group Delay in Cavity Optomechanical Systems
   with Degenerate Fermi Gas
SO PHOTONICS
AB We theoretically investigate the optical response and the propagation of an external probe field in a Fabry-Perot cavity, which consists of a mechanical mode of trapped, ultracold, fermionic atoms inside and simultaneously driven by an optical laser field. We investigate the electromagnetically-induced transparency due to coupling of the optical cavity field with the collective density excitations of the ultracold fermionic atoms via radiation pressure force. Moreover, we discuss the variations in the phase and group delay of the transmitted probe field with respect to effective cavity detuning as well as pumping power. It is observed that the transmitted field is lagging in this fermionic cavity optomechanical system. Our study shall provide a method to control the propagation as well as the speed of the transmitted probe field in this kind of fermionic, ultracold, atom-based, optomechanical cavity system, which might have potential applications in optical communications, signal processing and quantum information processing.

TI Direct characterization of coherence of quantum detectors by sequential
   measurements
SO ADVANCED PHOTONICS
AB The quantum properties of quantum measurements are indispensable resources in quantum information processing and have drawn extensive research interest. The conventional approach to revealing quantum properties relies on the reconstruction of entire measurement operators by quantum detector tomography. However, many specific properties can be determined by a part of the matrix components of the measurement operators, which makes it possible to simplify the characterization process. We propose a general framework to directly obtain individual matrix elements of the measurement operators by sequentially measuring two noncompatible observables. This method allows us to circumvent the complete tomography of the quantum measurement and extract the required information. We experimentally implement this scheme to monitor the coherent evolution of a general quantum measurement by determining the off-diagonal matrix elements. The investigation of the measurement precision indicates the good feasibility of our protocol for arbitrary quantum measurements. Our results pave the way for revealing the quantum properties of quantum measurements by selectively determining the matrix components of the measurement operators.

TI Unconventional magnon excitation by off-resonant microwaves
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
AB It is widely recognized that a physical system can respond to a periodic driving significantly only when the driving frequency matches the normal mode frequency of the system, which leads to resonance. Off-resonant phenomena are rarely considered because of the difficulty to realize strong coupling between physical systems and off-resonant waves. Here we examine the response of a magnetic system to squeezed light and surprisingly find that the magnons are maximally excited when the effective driving frequency is several orders of magnitude larger than the resonant frequency. The generated magnons are squeezed, which brings the advantage of tunable squeezing through an external magnetic field. Furthermore, we demonstrate that such off-resonant quasiparticle excitation is universal in all the hybrid systems in which the coherent and parametric interaction of bosons exists and that it is purely a quantum effect, which is rooted in the quantum fluctuations of particles in the squeezed vacuum. Our findings may provide an unconventional route to study off-resonant phenomena and may further benefit the use of hybrid matter-light systems in continuous-variable quantum information.

TI Hybrid microwave-optical scanning probe for addressing solid-state spins
   in nanophotonic cavities
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB Spin-photon interfaces based on solid-state atomic defects have enabled a variety of key applications in quantum information processing. To maximize the light-matter coupling strength, defects are often placed inside nanoscale devices. Efficiently coupling light and microwave radiation into these structures is an experimental challenge, especially in cryogenic or high vacuum environments with limited sample access. In this work, we demonstrate a fiber-based scanning probe that simultaneously couples light into a planar photonic circuit and delivers high power microwaves for driving electron spin transitions. The optical portion achieves 46% one-way coupling efficiency, while the microwave portion supplies an AC magnetic field with strength up to 9 Gauss at 10 Watts of input microwave power. The entire probe can be scanned across a large number of devices inside a He-3 cryostat without free-space optical access. We demonstrate this technique with silicon nanophotonic circuits coupled to single Er3+ ions. (c) 2021 Optical Society of America under the terms of the OSA Open Access Publishing Agreement

TI A linear algorithm for the restricted subtraction games
SO FRONTIERS IN PHYSICS
AB The subtraction game is a well-known problem in the field of game theory, which is often called a one-heap Nim game. There are two players, a heap of tokens, and a strategy matrix, in this game. It is called a restricted subtraction game if some constraints are imposed on the strategy matrix. The subtraction game could be solved by a classical algorithm with a query complexity no less than O(N (2)) and computed by an O ( N 3 2 l o g N ) quantum query algorithm with an error probability epsilon & LE; 1 N . The restricted subtraction game proposed by Huang et al. can be computed by an exact quantum algorithm with O ( N 3 2 ) queries. They also proved that the classical exact query complexity is & UTheta;(N (2)). In this study, we use an array and an adjacency list to replace the strategy matrix and propose another more general subtraction game than the one introduced by Huang et al. Based on dynamic programming and the replaced game strategy, two linear classical query algorithms are designed to solve the restricted subtraction game proposed by Huang and this study, respectively.

TI Reinforcement Learning-Based Formulations With Hamiltonian-Inspired Loss
   Functions for Combinatorial Optimization Over Graphs
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) is a versatile approach used to represent a wide range of NP-hard Combinatorial Optimization (CO) problems through binary variables. The transformation of QUBO to an Ising Hamiltonian is recognized as an effective method for solving key optimization problems using quantum algorithms. Recently, PI-GNN, a generic framework, has been proposed to address CO problems over graphs based on QUBO with Hamiltonian loss function to train the underlying GNN architecture. Though PI-GNN is highly scalable, it exhibits a noticeable decrease in terms of the number of satisfied constraints with higher graph densities. In this paper, firstly, we identify the limitations and empirically present our strategy to improve PI-GNN's performance. Secondly, we formulate and evaluate two strategies to integrate QUBO-Hamiltonian as the generic loss function in Reinforcement learning-based (RL) frameworks. The major contribution of our work lies in understanding the feasibility and quality of the QUBO-based generic reward function in an unsupervised RL setup in addressing graph-based CO problems. Empirically, through our empirical evaluation (Our implementation can be found in https://tinyurl.com/5apnymz7), we have observed up to 44% improvement in terms of the number of satisfied constraints over PI-GNN in a representative Max-Cut problem.

TI Using matrix-product states for time-series machine learning
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Matrix-product states (MPS) have proven to be a versatile ansatz for modeling quantum many-body physics. For many applications, and particularly in one-dimension, they capture relevant quantum correlations in manybody wave functions while remaining tractable (polynomial scaling) to store and manipulate on a classical computer. This has motivated researchers to also apply the MPS ansatz to machine learning (ML) problems where capturing complex correlations in datasets is also a key requirement. Here, for the first time, we develop an MPS-based algorithm, MPSTime, for learning a joint probability distribution underlying a time-series dataset, and show how it can be used to tackle important time-series ML problems, including classification and imputation. MPSTime can efficiently learn complicated time-series probability distributions directly from data, requires only moderate maximum MPS bond dimension chi max (with values for our applications ranging between chi max = 20 - 160), and can be trained for both classification and imputation tasks under a single logarithmic loss function. Using synthetic and publicly available real-world datasets-spanning applications in medicine, energy, and astronomy-we demonstrate performance competitive with state-of-the-art ML approaches, but with the key advantage of encoding the full joint probability distribution learned from the data, which is useful for analyzing and interpreting its underlying structure. This manuscript is supplemented with the release of a publicly available code package MPSTime that implements our approach, and can be used to reproduce all presented results. The effectiveness of the MPS-based ansatz for capturing complex correlation structures in time-series data makes it a powerful foundation for tackling challenging time-series analysis problems across science, industry, and medicine.

TI Large fluctuations and primordial black holes
SO PHYSICS REPORTS-REVIEW SECTION OF PHYSICS LETTERS
AB In this paper, we review in detail different mechanisms of generation of large primordial fluctuations and their implications for the production of primordial black holes (PBHs) and scalar-induced secondary gravity waves (SIGW), with the ultimate aim of understanding the impact of loop correction on quantum correlations and the power spectrum. To accomplish the goal, we provide a concise, comprehensive, but in depth review of conceptual and technical details of the standard model of the universe, namely, causal structure and inflation, quantization of primordial perturbations and field theoretic techniques such as "in-in"formalism needed for the estimation of loop correction to the power spectrum. We discuss at length the severe constraints (nogo) on PBH production in single-field inflation imposed by appropriately renormalized quantum loop corrections, computed while maintaining the validity of the perturbation framework and assuming sufficient inflation to address the causality problem. Thereafter, we discuss in detail the efforts to circumvent the no-go result in Galileon inflation, multiple sharp transition (MST)-induced inflation, and stochastic single field inflation using an effective field theoretic (EFT) framework applicable to a variety of models. We provide a thorough analysis of the Dynamical Renormalization Group (DRG) re- summation approach, adiabatic and late-time renormalization schemes, and their use in producing solar and sub-solar mass PBHs. Additionally, we give a summary of how scalar-induced gravitational waves (SIGWs) are produced in MST setups and Galileon inflation. Finally, the PBH overproduction issue is thoroughly discussed.

TI Multi-body entanglement and information rearrangement in nuclear
   many-body systems: a study of the Lipkin-Meshkov-Glick model
SO EUROPEAN PHYSICAL JOURNAL A
AB We examine how effective-model-space (EMS) calculations of nuclear many-body systems rearrange and converge multi-particle entanglement. The generalized Lipkin-Meshkov-Glick (LMG) model is used to motivate and provide insight for future developments of entanglement-driven descriptions of nuclei. The effective approach is based on a truncation of the Hilbert space together with a variational rotation of the qubits (spins), which constitute the relevant elementary degrees of freedom. The non-commutivity of the rotation and truncation allows for an exponential improvement of the energy convergence throughout much of the model space. Our analysis examines measures of correlations and entanglement, and quantifies their convergence with increasing cut-off. We focus on one- and two-spin entanglement entropies, mutual information, and n-tangles for n = 2, 4 to estimate multi-body entanglement. The effective description strongly suppresses entropies and mutual information of the rotated spins, while being able to recover the exact results to a large extent with lowcut-offs. Naive truncations of the bare Hamiltonian, on the other hand, artificially underestimate these measures. The n-tangles in the present model provide a basis-independent measures of n-particle entanglement. While these are more difficult to capture with the EMS description, the improvement in convergence, compared to truncations of the bare Hamiltonian, is significantly more dramatic. We conclude that the low-energy EMS techniques, that successfully provide predictive capabilities for low-lying observables in many-body systems, exhibit analogous efficacy for quantum correlations and multi-body entanglement in the LMG model, motivating future studies in nuclear many-body systems and effective field theories relevant to high-energy physics and nuclear physics.

TI Links between Quantum Distinguishers Based on Simon's Algorithm and
   Truncated Differentials
SO IACR TRANSACTIONS ON SYMMETRIC CRYPTOLOGY
AB In this paper, we study the quantum security of block ciphers based on Simon's period-finding quantum algorithm. We explored the relations between periodic functions and truncated differentials. The basic observation is that truncated differentials with a probability of 1 can be used to construct periodic functions, and two such constructions are presented with the help of a new notion called differenceannihilation matrix . This technique releases us from the tedious manual work of verifying the period of functions. Based on these new constructions, we find an 8 -round quantum distinguisher for LBlock and a 9/10/11/13/15 -round quantum distinguisher for SIMON -32/48/64/96/128 which are the best results as far as we know. Besides, to explore the security bounds of block cipher structures against Simon's algorithm based quantum attacks, the unified structure, which unifies the Feistel, Lai-Massey, and most generalized Feistel structures, is studied. We estimate the exact round number of probability 1 truncated differentials that one can construct. Based on these results, one can easily check the quantum security of specific block ciphers that are special cases of unified structures, when the details of the non-linear building blocks are not considered.

TI Multiparty entanglement microscopy of quantum Ising models in one, two,
   and three dimensions
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
AB Entanglement microscopy reveals the true quantum correlations among the microscopic building blocks of many-body systems [Nat. Commun. 16, 96 (2025)]. Using this approach, we study the multipartite entanglement of the quantum Ising model in 1D, 2D, and 3D. We first obtain the full reduced density matrix (tomography) of subregions that have at most four sites via quantum Monte Carlo, exact diagonalization, and the exact solution in 1D. We then analyze both bipartite and genuine multipartite entanglement (GME) among the sites in the subregion. To do so, we use a variety of measures including the negativity, as well as a true measure of GME: the genuinely multipartite concurrence (or GME concurrence), and its computationally cheaper lower bound I2. We provide a complete proof that I2 bounds the GME concurrence, and show how the symmetries of the state simplify its evaluation. For adjacent sites, we find three- and four-spin GME present across large portions of the phase diagram, reaching a maximum near the quantum critical point. In 1D, we identify the singular scaling of the derivative dI2/dh approaching the critical point. We observe a sharp decrease in GME with increasing dimensionality, consistent with the monogamous nature of entanglement. Furthermore, we find that GME vanishes for subregions consisting of nonadjacent sites in both 2D and 3D, offering a stark illustration of the short-ranged nature of entanglement in equilibrium quantum matter [arXiv:2402.06677]. Finally, we analyze the most collective form of entanglement by evaluating the GME concurrence among all spins in the lattice, which can be obtained from a simple observable: the single-site transverse magnetization. This global concurrence is larger in 1D compared to 2D and 3D, but it is relatively less robust against perturbations such as local measurements.

TI Discriminating quantum gravity models by gravitational decoherence
SO NUCLEAR PHYSICS B
AB Several phenomenological approaches to quantum gravity predict the existence of a minimal measurable length and/or a maximum measurable momentum near the Planck scale. When embedded into the frame -work of quantum mechanics, such constraints induce a modification of the canonical commutation relations and thus a generalization of the Heisenberg uncertainty relations, commonly referred to as generalized uncertainty principle (GUP). Different models of quantum gravity imply different forms of the GUP. For instance, in the framework of string theory the GUP is quadratic in the momentum operator, while in the context of doubly special relativity it includes an additional linear dependence. Among the possible physical consequences, it was recently shown that the quadratic GUP induces a universal decoherence mechanism, provided one assumes a foamy structure of quantum spacetime close to the Planck length. Along this line, in the present work we investigate the gravitational decoherence associated to the linear-quadratic GUP and we compare it with the one associated to the quadratic GUP. We find that, despite their similarities, the two generalizations of the Heisenberg uncertainty principle yield decoherence times that are completely uncorrelated and significantly distinct. Motivated by this result, we introduce a theoretical and experimental scheme based on cavity optomechanics to measure the different time evolution of nonlocal quantum correlations corresponding to the two aforementioned decoherence mechanisms. We find that the deviation between the two predictions occurs on time scales that are macroscopic and thus potentially amenable to experimental verification. This scenario provides a possible setting to discriminate between different forms of the GUP and therefore different models of quantum gravity.(c) 2023 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB Mechanobiology helps us to decipher cell and tissue functions by looking at changes in their mechanical properties that contribute to development, cell differentiation, physiology, and disease. Mechanobiology sits at the interface of biology, physics and engineering. One of the key technologies that enables characterization of properties of cells and tissue is microscopy. Combining microscopy with other quantitative measurement techniques such as optical tweezers and scissors, gives a very powerful tool for unraveling the intricacies of mechanobiology enabling measurement of forces, torques and displacements at play. We review the field of some light based studies of mechanobiology and optical detection of signal transduction ranging from optical micromanipulation-optical tweezers and scissors, advanced fluorescence techniques and optogenentics. In the current perspective paper, we concentrate our efforts on elucidating interesting measurements of forces, torques, positions, viscoelastic properties, and optogenetics inside and outside a cell attained when using structured light in combination with optical tweezers and scissors. We give perspective on the field concentrating on the use of structured light in imaging in combination with tweezers and scissors pointing out how novel developments in quantum imaging in combination with tweezers and scissors can bring to this fast growing field.

TI The boundary effect of s quark matter and self-similarity structure
   influence of K meson on quark-gluon plasma-hadron phase transition
SO ACTA PHYSICA SINICA
AB We investigate the boundary effect of small-scale s quark matter and the self-similarity structure influence of strange hadrons in the hadron gas on quark-gluon plasma (QGP)-hadron phase transition. In this study, the multiple reflection expansion method is used to investigate the boundary effect of QGP droplets containing s quarks. The calculation reveals that under the influence of boundary effect, small-scale s quark matter exhibits that energy density, entropy density, and pressure are all lower. In the hadron phase, there exists a two-body self-similarity structure between K mesons and neighboring pi mesons, subjected to collective flow, quantum correlations, and strong interactions. By using two-body fractal model to study the self-similarity structure of the K meson in meson and quark aspects, it is found that the self-similarity structure of the K meson exists in hadron phase, resluting in an increase in the energy density, entropy density, and pressure of the K meson. Furthermore, under the influence of self-similarity structure, the derived transverse momentum spectrum of K meson shows excellent agreement with experimental data (Fig. (a)). This study predicts that in the HIAF energy region, the self-similarity structure factor of K meson q(1) approaches 1.042. Additionaly, under the combined influence of boundary effects and self-similarity structure of K and pi mesons, the phase transition temperature of s quark matter increases (Fig. (b)). Morover, if the boundary of s quark matter is more curved, the increase of phase transition temperature becomes more pronounced compared to the effect of self-similarity structure alone.

TI Sparse Random Hamiltonians Are Quantumly Easy
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW X
AB A candidate application for quantum computers is to simulate the low-temperature properties of quantum systems. For this task, there is a well-studied quantum algorithm that performs quantum phase estimation on an initial trial state that has a non-negligible overlap with a low-energy state. However, it is notoriously hard to give theoretical guarantees that such a trial state can be prepared efficiently. Moreover, the heuristic proposals that are currently available, such as with adiabatic state preparation, appear insufficient in practical cases. This paper shows that, for most random sparse Hamiltonians, the maximally mixed state is a sufficiently good trial state, and phase estimation efficiently prepares states with energy arbitrarily close to the ground energy. Furthermore, any low-energy state must have non-negligible quantum circuit complexity, suggesting that low-energy states are classically nontrivial and phase estimation is the optimal method for preparing such states (up to polynomial factors). These statements hold for two models of random Hamiltonians: (i) a sum of random signed Pauli strings and (ii) a random signed d-sparse Hamiltonian. The main technical argument is based on some new results in nonasymptotic random matrix theory. In particular, a refined concentration bound for the spectral density is required to obtain complexity guarantees for these random Hamiltonians.

TI Mutual cooperative effects between the mode components of two-photon and
   Raman induced cavity lasing processes
SO OPTICS COMMUNICATIONS
AB The paper proposes to unify the two-photon laser and induced cooperative scattering Raman lasing in which the flying ensemble of two-level excited radiators are coupled with the bimodal cavity field in nonlinear two photon and scattering interactions. It discusses the situation in which the induced two-quantum lasing takes place together with the cooperative scattering conversion of photons between the pump, Stokes, and anti Stokes cavity modes. The proposed master equation describes cooperative energy exchanges between Raman and two-photon lasing processes by portions of energies multiple to the energy of the entangled photon pair.
   The generators of such emission and absorption processes belonging to the symmetries of Raman conversion and two-photon cooperative generation are unified. The first symmetry belongs to su(2) algebra connected to the scattering conversion in the Stokes, pump, and anti-Stokes modes of cavity (Opt. Commun.,285(5) (2012) 686-692). The second one belongs to multi-mode su(1,1) symmetry which quantifies the cooperative process belonging to two-photon emission in cavity/fiber mode components of field (see Opt. Commun. 247(4-6) (2005) 381-392). The bimodal collective photon operators are introduced describing the emission or absorption acts of the fixed portion of energy from the cavity equal to the transition energy between the states of each excited atom. A key impact of the study focuses on the statistical properties of the bimodal field and their detection possibilities are proposed for the description of the time evolution of quantum correlations between the field components of Raman conversion and two-photon emission.

TI Review and Comparison of US, EU, and UK Regulations on Cyber
   Risk/Security of the Current Blockchain Technologies: Viewpoint from
   2023
SO REVIEW OF SOCIONETWORK STRATEGIES
AB The first cryptocurrency was invented in 2008/09, but the Blockchain-Web3 concept is still in its infancy, and the cyber risk is constantly changing. Cybersecurity should also be adapting to these changes to ensure security of personal data and continuation of operations. This article starts with a comparison of existing cybersecurity standards and regulations from the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) and the International Organisation for Standardisation (ISO)-ISO27001, followed by a discussion on more specific and recent standards and regulations, such as the Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation (MiCA), Committee on Payments and Market Infrastructures and the International Organisation of Securities Commissions (CPMI-IOSCO), and more general cryptography (and post-quantum cryptography), in the context of cybersecurity. These topics are followed up by a review of recent technical reports on cyber risk/security and a discussion on cloud security questions. Comparison of Blockchain cyber risk is also performed on the recent EU standards on cyber security, including European Cybersecurity Certification Scheme (EUCS)-cloud, and US standards-The National Vulnerability Database (NVD) Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS). The study includes a review of Blockchain endpoint security, and new technologies e.g., IoT. The research methodology applied is a review and case study analysing secondary data on cybersecurity. The research significance is the integration of knowledge from the United States (US), the European Union (EU), the United Kingdom (UK), and international standards and frameworks on cybersecurity that can be alighted to new Blockchain projects. The results show that cybersecurity standards are not designed in close cooperation between the two major western blocks: US and EU. In addition, while the US is still leading in this area, the security standards for cryptocurrencies, internet-of-things, and blockchain technologies have not evolved as fast as the technologies have. The key finding from this study is that although the crypto-market has grown into a multi-trillion industry, the crypto-market has also lost over 70% since its peak, causing significant financial loss for individuals and cooperation's. Despite this significant impact to individuals and society, cybersecurity standards and financial governance regulations are still in their infancy, specifically in the UK.

TI A Newton Method for Hausdorff Approximations of the Pareto Front Within
   Multiobjective Evolutionary Algorithms
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON EVOLUTIONARY COMPUTATION
AB A common goal in evolutionary multiobjective optimization is to find suitable finite-size approximations of the Pareto front of a given multiobjective optimization problem. While many multiobjective evolutionary algorithms (MOEAs) have proven to be very efficient in finding good Pareto front approximations, they may need quite a few resources or may even fail to obtain optimal or nearly optimal approximations. Hereby, optimality is implicitly defined by the chosen performance indicator. In this work, we propose a set-based Newton method for the Hausdorff approximations of the Pareto front to be used within MOEAs. To this end, we first generalize the previously proposed Newton step for the performance indicator to treat constrained problems for general reference sets. To approximate the target Pareto front, we propose a particular strategy for generating the reference set that utilizes the data gathered by the evolutionary algorithm during its run. Finally, we show the benefit of the Newton method as a postprocessing step on several benchmark test functions and different base evolutionary algorithms.

TI SABRE and PHIP pumped RASER and the route to chaos
SO JOURNAL OF MAGNETIC RESONANCE
AB In a RASER (Radio-frequency Amplification by Stimulated Emission of Radiation), the fast relaxing electromagnetic modes of an LC resonator are enslaved by the slow nuclear spin motion, whose coherence decays with the transverse relaxation rate gamma(m) 1/4 1=T-2(*). Such a system obeys the slaving principle, mathematically identical with the adiabatic elimination procedure, leading to multi-mode RASER equations. If the pumping rate of nuclear spin polarization Gamma >> gamma(m), a second adiabatic elimination process applies and the spectral properties of the RASER can be predicted. The resulting model is similar to the model of two non-linear coupled oscillators and predicts the observed RASER phenomena, including frequency combs and mode collapse. If the second adiabatic elimination is not applicable, mode collapse is completely absent and successive period doubling processes and chaos occur at very high population inversions. We compare these theoretical predictions with experimental results from a PHIP (Para-Hydrogen Induced Polarization) pumped 1H RASER. Moreover, in SABRE (Signal Amplification By Reversible Exchange) pumped 1H experiments, RASER revivals are observed long after the parahydrogen pumping source has been switched off. All these findings shed light onto the links between NMR spectroscopy, RASER physics, synergetics and chaos theory. Several new applications are envisioned in the fields of quantum sensor technology, structure investigation or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). (C) 2020 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI Work Statistics and Entanglement Across the Fermionic
   Superfluid-Insulator Transition
SO ADVANCED QUANTUM TECHNOLOGIES
AB Entanglement in many-body systems may display quantum phase transition signatures, and analogous insights are emerging in the study of work fluctuations. Here, the fermionic superfluid-to-insulator transition (SIT) is considered and related to its entanglement properties and its work distribution statistics. Using the attractive fermionic Hubbard model with randomly distributed impurities, the work distribution is analyzed under two quench protocols triggering the SIT. In the first, the concentration of impurities is increased; in the second, the impurities' disorder strength is varied. The results indicate that, at criticality, the entanglement is minimized while the average work is maximized. This study demonstrates that, for this state, density fluctuations vanish at all orders, resulting in all central moments of the work probability distribution being precisely zero. For systems undergoing a precursor to the transition (short chains with finite impurity potential) numerical results confirm these predictions, with higher moments further from the ideal results. For both protocols, at criticality, the system absorbs the most energy with almost no penalty in terms of fluctuations: ultimately this feature can be used to implement a quantum critical battery. The impact of temperature on this critical behaviour is also investigated and shown to favor work extraction for high enough temperatures.
   Small quantum systems can become hardware for quantum thermal machines. They may display quantum correlations and critical behavior, both affecting energetic properties. Here, thermodynamic processes across the superfluid-to-insulator transition are studied. At criticality, the vanishing of density fluctuations simultaneously minimizes the entanglement and maximizes the average work. Ultimately, this feature can be used to implement a quantum critical battery.image

TI Designing high-power, octave spanning entangled photon sources for
   quantum spectroscopy
SO JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL PHYSICS
AB Entangled photon spectroscopy is a nascent field that has important implications for measurement and imaging across chemical, biology, and materials fields. Entangled photon spectroscopy potentially offers improved spatial and temporal-frequency resolutions, increased cross sections for multiphoton and nonlinear measurements, and new abilities in inducing or measuring quantum correlations. A critical step in enabling entangled photon spectroscopies is the creation of high-flux entangled sources that can use conventional detectors as well as provide redundancy for the losses in realistic samples. Here, we report a periodically poled, chirped, lithium tantalate platform that generates entangled photon pairs with similar to 10(-7) efficiency. For a near watt level diode laser, this results in a near mu W-level flux. The single photon per mode limit that is necessary to maintain non-classical photon behavior is still satisfied by distributing this power over up to an octave-spanning bandwidth. The spectral-temporal photon correlations are observed via a Michelson-type interferometer that measures the broadband Hong-Ou-Mandel two-photon interference. A coherence time of 245 fs for a 10 nm bandwidth in the collinear case and a coherence time of 62 fs for a 125 nm bandwidth in the non-collinear case are measured using a CW pump laser and, essentially, collecting the full photon cone. We outline in detail the numerical methods used for designing and tailoring the entangled photons source, such as changing center wavelength or bandwidth, with the ultimate aim of increasing the availability of high-flux UV-Vis entangled photon sources in the optical spectroscopy community.

TI The Overlap Gap Property Limits Limit Swapping in the QAOA
SO QUANTUM INFORMATION & COMPUTATION
AB The Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) is a quantum algorithm designed for Combinatorial Optimization Problem (COP). We show that if a local algorithm is limited in performance at logarithmic depth for a spin glass type COP with an underlying Erd & ouml;s-Renyi hypergraph, then a random regular hypergraph is similarly limited in performance as well. As such, we re-derived the fact that the average-case value obtained by the QAOA for even q >= 4, Max-q-XORSAT is bounded away from optimality when optimized using asymptotic analysis due to the Overlap Gap Property (OGP). While this result was proven before, the proof is rather technical compared to ours. In addition, we show that the earlier result implicitly also implies limitation at logarithmic depth p <= & varepsilon; log n, providing an improvement over limitation at constant depth. Furthermore, the extension to logarithmic depth leads to a tightening of the upper bound that the QAOA outputs at logarithmic depth for MaxCUT and Max-q-XORSAT problems. We also provide some numerical evidence that the limitation should be extended to odd q by showing that the OGP exists for the Max-3-XORSAT on random regular graphs.

TI Manipulating thermal light via displaced-photon subtraction
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Thermal radiation played a pivotal role in the preliminary development of quantum physics where it helped resolve the apparent incongruity of the ultraviolet catastrophe. In contemporary physics, thermal state generation and manipulation finds new application in fields such as quantum imaging and quantum illumination and as a practical realization of Maxwell???s demon. These applications often go hand in hand with photon subtraction operations which probabilistically amplify the mean photon number (MPN) of thermal light as a result of its super-Poissonian photon statistics. In this article, we introduce an operation for thermal states of light based on a generalized photon subtraction scheme. Displaced-photon subtraction (DPS) makes use of coherent state displacement followed by a subsequent anti-displacement in combination with single-photon detection to probe the MPN of a thermal state. We find regimes in which the output of a successful DPS is amplified, unchanged, or attenuated relative to the unconditioned output state. The regime of operation is controlled via the magnitude of the coherent displacement. A theoretical description of generalized photon subtraction of a displaced thermal state is derived via a two-mode moment-generating function (MGF) and used to describe generalized DPS. We perform a proof of principle experimental implementation of DPS for the case of a balanced beam splitter for which results demonstrate good agreement with the model.

TI Importance of PAR interception and radiation use efficiency on growth
   and yield of Potatoes under different microclimates in the upper
   Brahmaputra valley zone of Assam
SO MAUSAM
AB A field experiment was conducted at Assam Agricultural University, Jorhat, Assam, during rabi 2018-19 to assess the PAR interception and radiation use efficiency in potato variety Kufri Jyoti under different microclimates, which was planted in split plot design with four dates of plantings starting from 10 November (P1) at ten days interval and three mulching treatments, viz., water hyacinth, black polythene and without mulching. The incident, reflected and transmitted PAR was measured periodically over the crop with a line quantum sensor and daily incident radiation was calculated from incident PAR and bright sunshine hours. The interception of PAR (iPAR) varied considerably among different treatments, while the highest iPAR was recorded under the first date of planting and mulching treatment with water hyacinth. The leaf area index (LAI) and biomass production were highest in crops planted on first planting date with water hyacinth mulch. The RUE for tuber yield was highest in water hyacinth (2.35 g MJ-1) followed by black polythene (2.03 g MJ-1) and non-mulched (1.67 g MJ-1) condition, while among planting dates, it was highest in first date of planting. The LAI, biomass production and yield of potatoes were found to be significantly correlated with iPAR and RUE. The predictive models were developed using the stepwise regression method to predict tuber yield from iPAR and RUE, which have R2 values of 0.96 and 0.99, respectively.

TI The Optimization of Microwave Field Characteristics for ODMR Measurement
   of Nitrogen-Vacancy Centers in Diamond
SO PHOTONICS
AB A typical solid-state quantum sensor can be developed based on negatively charged nitrogen-vacancy (NV-) centers in diamond. The electron spin state of NV- can be controlled and read at room temperature. Through optical detection magnetic resonance (ODMR) technology, temperature measurement can be achieved at the nanoscale. The key to ODMR technology is to apply microwave resonance to manipulate the electron spin state of the NV-. Therefore, the microwave field characteristics formed near the NV- have a crucial impact on the sensitivity of ODMR measurement. This article mainly focuses on the temperature situation in cellular applications and simulates the influence of structural parameters of double open loop resonant (DOLR) microwave antennas and broadband large-area (BLA) microwave antennas on the microwave field's resonance frequency, quality factor Q, magnetic field strength, uniformity, etc. The parameters are optimized to have sufficient bandwidth, high signal-to-noise ratio, low power loss, and high magnetic field strength in the temperature range of 36 degree celsius to 42.5 degree celsius. Finally, the ODMR spectra are used for effect comparison, and the signal-to-noise ratio and Q values of the ODMR spectra are compared when using different antennas. We have provided an optimization method for the design of microwave antennas and it is concluded that the DOLR microwave antenna is more suitable for living cell temperature measurement in the future.

TI On the influence of reference sample properties on magnetic force
   microscopy calibrations
SO REVIEW OF SCIENTIFIC INSTRUMENTS
AB Magnetic force microscopy (MFM) allows the characterization of magnetic stray field distributions with high sensitivity and spatial resolution. Based on a suitable calibration procedure, MFM can also yield quantitative magnetic field values. This process typically involves measuring a reference sample to determine the distribution of the tip's stray field or stray field gradient at the sample surface. This distribution is called the tip transfer function (TTF) and is derived through regularized deconvolution in Fourier space. The properties of the reference sample and the noise characteristics of the detection system significantly influence the derived TTF, thereby limiting its validity range. In a recent study, the tip stray field distribution, and hence the TTF, of an MFM tip was independently measured in real space using a nitrogen vacancy center as a quantum sensor, revealing considerable discrepancies with the reference-sample-based TTF. Here, we analyze the influence of the feature distribution of the reference sample and the MFM measurement parameters on the resulting TTF. We explain the observed differences between quantum-calibrated stray field distributions and the classical approach by attributing them to a loss of information due to missing or suppressed spectral components. Furthermore, we emphasize the importance of the spectral coverage of the TTF. Our findings indicate that for high-quality reconstruction of the stray field of a sample under test (SUT), it is more critical to ensure a strong overlap of frequency components between the reference sample and the SUT than to achieve an accurate real-space reconstruction of the tip stray field distribution.

TI Controllable terahertz radiation from electrically tunable plasmonic
   metasurfaces based on multiple quantum wells
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB Subwavelength plasmonic metasurfaces combined with multiple quantum wells (MQWs) heterostructures have recently demonstrated highly efficient nonlinear wave generation under low power input intensities. They can pave the way for developing highly efficient, compact, tunable and room temperature terahertz (THz) wave sources through the mixing and down-conversion of optical incident pumps. In this paper, we study and analyze the electrically controllable THz radiation of a nonlinear metasurface loaded with MQW through difference frequency generation (DFG) process. An analytical formulation procedure based on the effective nonlinear susceptibility model and free-space Green's function is proposed for derivation of generated THz wave radiation pattern. Also, we demonstrate phase and amplitude variation of intrinsic second-order nonlinear susceptibility coefficient of MQW by applying different bias voltages. Far-field directivity pattern of DFG radiation from the linear array configuration of plasmonic nonlinear metacells is obtained at 5.5 THz through the proposed analytical method and is verified by full-wave analysis. Using the proposed electrical tunability of MQW nonlinear susceptibility, THz beam steering of the nonlinear metasurface is demonstrated which is rotated from -20 to 20 degree through different bias voltages. Our work proposes an effective tool for rapid and accurate design and analysis of highly efficient THz electrically tunable MQW nonlinear metasurfaces for future applications in THz wireless communications, spectroscopy and quantum imaging.

TI Microwave electrometry with Rydberg atoms in a vapor cell using
   microwave amplitude modulation
SO CHINESE PHYSICS B
AB We have theoretically and experimentally studied the dispersive signal of the Rydberg atomic electromagnetically-induced transparency (EIT) Autler-Townes (AT) splitting spectra obtained using amplitude modulation of the microwave (MW) electric field. In addition to the two zero-crossing points interval Delta f zeros, the dispersion signal has two positive maxima with an interval defined as the shoulder interval Delta f sho, which is theoretically expected to be used to measure a much weaker MW electric field. The relationship of the MW field strength E MW and Delta f sho is experimentally studied at the MW frequencies of 31.6 GHz and 9.2 GHz respectively. The results show that Delta f sho can be used to characterize the much weaker E MW than that of Delta f zeros and the traditional EIT-AT splitting interval Delta f m; the minimum E MW measured by Delta f sho is about 30 times smaller than that by Delta f m. As an example, the minimum E MW at 9.2 GHz that can be characterized by Delta f sho is 0.056 mV/cm, which is the minimum value characterized by the frequency interval using a vapor cell without adding any auxiliary fields. The proposed method can improve the weak limit and sensitivity of E MW measured by the spectral frequency interval, which is important in the direct measurement of weak E MW.

TI Criteria for Davies irreducibility of Markovian quantum dynamics
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICS A-MATHEMATICAL AND THEORETICAL
AB The dynamics of Markovian open quantum systems are described by Lindblad master equations, generating a quantum dynamical semigroup. An important concept for such systems is (Davies) irreducibility, i.e. the question whether there exist non-trivial invariant subspaces. Steady states of irreducible systems are unique and faithful, i.e. they have full rank. In the 1970s, Frigerio showed that a system is irreducible if the Lindblad operators span a self-adjoint set with trivial commutant. We discuss a more general and powerful algebraic criterion, showing that a system is irreducible if and only if the multiplicative algebra generated by the Lindblad operators La and the operator iH+ n-ary sumation aLa dagger La , involving the Hamiltonian H, is the entire operator space. Examples for two-level systems, show that a change of Hamiltonian terms as well as the addition or removal of dissipators can render a reducible system irreducible and vice versa. Examples for many-body systems show that a large class of spin chains can be rendered irreducible by dissipators on just one or two sites. Additionally, we discuss the decisive differences between (Davies) reducibility and Evans reducibility for quantum channels and dynamical semigroups which has lead to some confusion in the recent physics literature, especially, in the context of boundary-driven systems. We give a criterion for quantum reducibility in terms of associated classical Markov processes and, lastly, discuss the relation of the main result to the stabilization of pure states and argue that systems with local Lindblad operators cannot stabilize pure Fermi-sea states.

TI Research Progress on Femtosecond Laser Fabrication of Nonlinear Photonic
   Crystals
SO CHINESE JOURNAL OF LASERS-ZHONGGUO JIGUANG
AB Significance The fabrication strategy for nonlinear photonic crystals has drawn substantial research interest because of their highly efficient nonlinear optical interactions. Femtosecond laser engineering has distinct advantages over conventional methods for the fabrication of nonlinear structures. These advantages include its high precision, resolution, and flexibility. This paper summarizes the research progress of femtosecond laser processing technology for constructing nonlinear photonic crystals and provides a brief introduction to the quasi-phase matching theory involved. The processing mechanism of femtosecond-laser-induced ferroelectric domain inversion and laser erasure of second order nonlinear polarization coefficients (chi((2))) are discussed, and the experimental results and applications of nonlinear photonic crystals in different dimensions realized by these two approaches are demonstrated. Finally, the challenges of the femtosecond laser technique in the processing of nonlinear photonic crystals are analyzed, and the prospects for future development are presented.
   Progress This paper summarizes the research progress of femtosecond laser processing technology for constructing nonlinear photonic crystals and also provides a brief introduction to the quasi- phase matching theory involved. The processing mechanism of femtosecond- laser- induced ferroelectric domain inversion and laser erasure of chi((2)) are discussed, and the experimental results and applications of nonlinear photonic crystals in different dimensions realized by these two approaches are demonstrated. Finally, the challenges faced by the femtosecond laser technique for processing nonlinear photonic crystals are analyzed, and the prospects for future development are discussed.
   Tightly focused femtosecond laser pulses can induce a thermoelectric field in the ferroelectric crystal that inverts the direction of spontaneous polarization. On the basis of this mechanism, an arbitrary arrangement of 2D inverted domains can be constructed to enhance the second-harmonic emission from the crystal, and quasi-phase-matching structures can be integrated in the LiNbO3 waveguide to achieve efficient frequency conversion (Fig. 4). This technique can also be used to fabricate 3D nonlinear photonic crystals in multi- domain/ single- domain Ba0.77Ca0.23TiO3(BCT)/ Ca0.28Ba0.72Nb2O6(CBN) crystals, which demonstrate second harmonic diffraction with 3D quasi- phase matching ( Fig. 5). Another technique that relies on the laser- induced amorphization of the crystal to partially erase.( 2) shows versatility for processing non- ferroelectric crystals. Multiple quasi-phase- matching structures can be inscribed into the waveguide core to realize a parallel multiwavelength output (Fig. 6). A 3D nonlinear photonic crystal has also been obtained using this technique in LiNbO3 to provide abundant 3D reciprocal vectors for second- harmonic generation in various directions ( Fig. 7). When processing inside the crystal, the aberration resulting from the mismatch of the refractive index causes an axial shift of the focal spot, which seriously limits the axial resolution as well as the fabrication quality of the structures. Reasonable diffractive optical components for aberration compensation must be implemented during fabrication. One method is to introduce a spatial light modulator into the femtosecond laser processing system, thereby eliminating the effect of aberration by loading a specific phase hologram. To date, few attempts have been made to combine nonlinear photonic crystals with other optical devices to extend their functionalities. Various functional optical devices, such as electro-optic modulators, resonators, waveguides, and nonlinear frequency converters, can be integrated within a single ferroelectric crystal by combining the flexibility of the femtosecond laser and other processing techniques. The integrated photonic chips exhibit more powerful functions in modern optical signal processing and quantum computing. Currently, chi((2)) can only be reduced by 20% using the femtosecond laser erasure technique, which restricts the modulation efficiency of the structures. Therefore, a deep understanding of the femtosecond laser interaction mechanism with the lattice is required to determine the optimal fabrication parameters for large-amplitude chi((2)) erasure, thereby improving the frequency conversion efficiency of the as-prepared structures. In addition to the aforementioned development trends, certain topics, such as the development of a fabrication strategy with high efficiency to lay the foundation for mass production, must be investigated further. With improved femtosecond laser processing technology, nonlinear photonic crystals show promising prospects.
   The spatial distribution of chi((2)) can modulate wavefronts in a new wavelength range; thus, it can be applied in optical communication, optical storage, and quantum information processing. Nonlinear patterns constructed flexibly by a femtosecond laser are capable of the nonlinear generation of vortices and Hermite- Gaussian beams. The as-prepared 3D nonlinear photonic crystal can realize the simultaneous conversion of the fundamental beam into multiple structured beams (Fig. 9) or efficient beam shaping based on full- dimensional phase matching and nonlinear volume holography (Fig. 10). In the past few years, researchers have also introduced detour phase encoding by femtosecond laser fabrication into nonlinear holography to realize the reconstruction of arbitrary target images ( Fig. 11). Moreover, the strategy of erasing nonlinear coefficients using femtosecond lasers can be applied to quartz crystals to obtain efficient frequency doubling in the challenging deep-ultraviolet region (Fig. 13).
   Conclusions and Prospects While substantial progress has been made in the femtosecond laser processing of nonlinear photonic crystals, some challenges remain.

TI Quantum phonon transport through channels and molecules-A Perspective
SO APPLIED PHYSICS LETTERS
AB Phonon transport is a dominant mechanism of thermal conduction in solids that has been studied for decades. A good understanding of many transport regimes in micro- and nanostructures has been established, including ballistic and diffusive transport, mode softening, or band structure engineering in phononic crystals. However, the limit of quantized transport and the engineering of single transport channels is much less explored. In this Perspective, we discuss concepts and theoretical and experimental progress in the field of quantized phonon transport in channels, such as molecular systems. We particularly highlight open questions and research opportunities that should be within experimental reach. Challenges in experimental sensitivity and control hinder fast experimental progress. Recently, however, heat transport measurements through quantum channels and single molecules have become available at room temperature using break junction techniques. These techniques are well established in the molecular electronics community and have recently been expanded to the measurement of heat transport on the single-molecule level. Given the new experimental capabilities, it is now inviting to address the rather unexplored area of molecular phonon-engineering. Several interesting theoretical predictions concern the realization of the phonon quantum interference effect, suppression of phonon current via the introduction of side groups to molecules, and the construction of a phonon diode device based on molecular anharmonicity and asymmetry. This Perspective should serve the experimental and theory community by listing key challenges, thus a roadmap for making progress in the field of quantized phonon transport.

TI Optical control of levitated nanoparticles via dipole-dipole interaction
SO NANOPHOTONICS
AB We propose a scheme to create and unidirectionally transport thermal squeezed states and random-phase coherent states in a system of two interacting levitated nanoparticles. In this coupled levitated system, we create a thermal squeezed state of motion in one of the nanoparticles by parametrically driving it and then transporting the state to the other nanoparticle by making use of a unidirectional transport mechanism. This mechanism is based on inducing a nonreciprocal type of coupling in the system by suitably modulating the phases of the trapping lasers and the interparticle distance between the levitated nanoparticles. A nonreciprocal coupling creates a unidirectional channel where energy flows from one nanoparticle to the other nanoparticle but not vice versa, thereby allowing for the transport of mechanical states between the nanoparticles. We also affirm this unidirectional transport mechanism by creating and efficiently transporting a random-phase coherent state in the coupled levitated system. In both instances of mechanical state transport, the final nanoparticle showed similar characteristics to the original nanoparticle, depicting a high-fidelity unidirectional transport mechanism. Further, we make use of the feedback nonlinearity and parametric driving to create simultaneous bistability in the coupled levitated system also via this unidirectional mechanism. Our results may have potential applications in tunable sensing, metrology, quantum networks, and in exploring many-body physics under a controlled environment.

TI Non-Markovian disentanglement dynamics in double-giant-atom
   waveguide-QED systems
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB We study the disentanglement dynamics of two giant atoms coupled to a common one-dimensional waveguide. We focus on the non-Markovian retarded effect in the disentanglement of the two giant atoms by taking the photon transmission time into account. By solving the time-delayed equations of motion for the probability amplitudes, we obtain the evolution of the entanglement of the two giant atoms, which are initially in the max-imally entangled states in the single-excitation space. It is found that the retardation-induced non-Markovianity leads to nonexponential decay and revivals of entanglement. Concretely, we consider separate-, braided-, and nested-coupling configurations, and find that the disentanglement dynamics in these configurations exhibits different features. We demonstrate that the steady-state entanglement depends on the time delay under certain conditions in these three coupling configurations. We also study the dependence of the disentanglement of the two giant atoms on both the detuning effect and the initial-state phase effect. In addition, we consider the disentanglement dynamics of the two giant atoms, which are initially in the state superposed by zero-excitation and two-excitation components. This work will pave the way for the generation of stationary entanglement between two giant atoms, which may have potential applications in the construction of large-scale quantum networks based on the giant-atom waveguide-QED systems.

TI Experimental cheat-sensitive quantum weak coin flipping
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB As in modern communication networks, the security of quantum networks will rely on complex cryptographic tasks that are based on a handful of fundamental primitives. Weak coin flipping (WCF) is a significant such primitive which allows two mistrustful parties to agree on a random bit while they favor opposite outcomes. Remarkably, perfect information-theoretic security can be achieved in principle for quantum WCF. Here, we overcome conceptual and practical issues that have prevented the experimental demonstration of this primitive to date, and demonstrate how quantum resources can provide cheat sensitivity, whereby each party can detect a cheating opponent, and an honest party is never sanctioned. Such a property is not known to be classically achievable with information-theoretic security. Our experiment implements a refined, loss-tolerant version of a recently proposed theoretical protocol and exploits heralded single photons generated by spontaneous parametric down conversion, a carefully optimized linear optical interferometer including beam splitters with variable reflectivities and a fast optical switch for the verification step. High values of our protocol benchmarks are maintained for attenuation corresponding to several kilometers of telecom optical fiber.
   Quantum-enhanced versions of weak coin flipping (a cryptographic primitive where two mistrustful parties agree on a random bit while favouring opposite outcomes) have been proposed in the past but never realised. Here, the authors fill this gap by improving on a previous proposal and implementing it with single photons in a fibre-based setup.

TI Accelerating Extreme Search of Multidimensional Functions Based on
   Natural Gradient Descent with Dirichlet Distributions
SO MATHEMATICS
AB The high accuracy attainment, using less complex architectures of neural networks, remains one of the most important problems in machine learning. In many studies, increasing the quality of recognition and prediction is obtained by extending neural networks with usual or special neurons, which significantly increases the time of training. However, engaging an optimization algorithm, which gives us a value of the loss function in the neighborhood of global minimum, can reduce the number of layers and epochs. In this work, we explore the extreme searching of multidimensional functions by proposed natural gradient descent based on Dirichlet and generalized Dirichlet distributions. The natural gradient is based on describing a multidimensional surface with probability distributions, which allows us to reduce the change in the accuracy of gradient and step size. The proposed algorithm is equipped with step-size adaptation, which allows it to obtain higher accuracy, taking a small number of iterations in the process of minimization, compared with the usual gradient descent and adaptive moment estimate. We provide experiments on test functions in four- and three-dimensional spaces, where natural gradient descent proves its ability to converge in the neighborhood of global minimum. Such an approach can find its application in minimizing the loss function in various types of neural networks, such as convolution, recurrent, spiking and quantum networks.

TI Culling a Self-Assembled Quantum Dot as a Single-Photon Source Using
   X-ray Microscopy
SO ACS NANO
AB Epitaxially grown self-assembled semiconductor quantumdots (QDs)with atom-like optical properties have emerged as the best choicefor single-photon sources required for the development of quantumtechnology and quantum networks. Nondestructive selection of a singleQD having desired structural, compositional, and optical characteristicsis essential to obtain noise-free, fully indistinguishable singleor entangled photons from single-photon emitters. Here, we show thatthe structural orientations and local compositional inhomogeneitieswithin a single QD and the surrounding wet layer can be probed ina screening fashion by scanning X-ray diffraction microscopy and X-rayfluorescence with a few tens of nanometers-sized synchrotron radiationbeam. The presented measurement protocol can be used to cull the bestsingle QD from the enormous number of self-assembled dots grown simultaneously.The obtained results show that the elemental composition and resultantstrain profiles of a QD are sensitive to in-plane crystallographicdirections. We also observe that lattice expansion after a certaincomposition-limitintroduces shear strain within a QD, enabling the possibility of controlledchiral-QD formation. Nanoscale chirality and compositional anisotropy,contradictory to common assumptions, need to be incorporated intoexisting theoretical models to predict the optical properties of single-photonsources and to further tune the epitaxial growth process of self-assembledquantum structures.

TI Low-loss high-fidelity frequency beam splitter with tunable split ratio
   based on electromagnetically induced transparency
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB A frequency beam splitter (FBS) with the split ratio of 0.5, i.e., 50/50 FBS, can be used as the frequency-mode Hadamard gate for frequency-encoded photonic qubits. A FBS with the split ratio of 1 is exactly the coherent frequency converter (CFC) for frequency up or down conversion of photons. Previous works revealed that all kinds of 50/50 FBS and CFC operating at the single-photon level had overall efficiency or output-to-input ratio around 50% or less. In this work, our 50/50 FBS and CFC are made with the four-wave mixing (FWM) process based on the double-A electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT) scheme. We achieved an overall efficiency of 90 +/- 4% in the 50/50 FBS and that of 84 +/- 4% in the CFC using coherent-state single photons, both of which are the best up-to-date records. Furthermore, we utilize the scheme of Hong-Ou-Mandel interference (HOMI) to measure the fidelity or degree of coherence of the FBS. The fidelity indicated by the HOMI's g((2)) measurement of the 50/50 FBS is 0.99 +/- 0.01. This high fidelity demonstrates the low noise of the frequency conversion in the EIT-based FWM process. Such low-loss high-fidelity FBS with the tunable split ratio can lead to useful operations or devices in long-distance quantum communication.

TI Concept and Feasibility Analysis of the Alba Cubesat Mission
SO AEROTECNICA MISSILI E SPAZIO
AB AlbaSat is a 2-Unit CubeSat which is being developed by a student team at the University of Padova. The Alba project aims to design, build, test, launch, and operate the first student CubeSat of the University of Padova, featuring four different payloads. The first goal is to collect data regarding the debris environment in Low Earth Orbit, the second goal is the study of the satellite vibrations, the third one is about CubeSat attitude determination through laser ranging technology, and the fourth goal concerns satellite laser and quantum communication. The Alba CubeSat mission has been selected by the European Space Agency to join the Fly Your Satellite! Design Booster program in December 2022. This paper presents the feasibility study of the Alba CubeSat mission reproduced in the framework of the "Space Systems Laboratory" class of Master of Science in Aerospace Engineering at the University of Padova. In the beginning, a mission requirements definition was conducted. After that, the mission feasibility was considered, with preliminary requirements verification to assess the ability of the spacecraft to survive the space environment, including compliance with Debris Mitigation Guidelines, ground station visibility and minimum operative lifetime evaluation. The Alba mission sets a base for a better understanding of the space environment and its interaction with nanosatellites, and an improvement of the accuracy of debris models.

TI Machine learning-based prediction of nonlinear optical rectification in
   GaAs/AlGaAs tetrapod core/shell quantum dots under pressure and central
   hydrogenic impurity effects
SO MATERIALS SCIENCE IN SEMICONDUCTOR PROCESSING
AB In this study, we investigate the nonlinear optical rectification (NOR) in GaAs/AlGaAs Conical Core/Shell Quantum Dots under varying temperature conditions, utilizing compact density matrix formalism. The energy levels and wave functions are computed by solving the Schro<spacing diaeresis>dinger equation with the Finite Element Method (FEM) within the framework of the effective mass approximation (EMA). The objective of the present study is to develop an accurate and efficient method for modelling and predicting the NOR coefficient, taking into account the influence of pressure effect on the quantum dot system. To achieve this, we apply a range of machine learning algorithms, specifically, four ML models were studied; Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), Decision Trees (DT), Gradient Boosting (GB) and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN). Among these, the Decision Tree model exhibits exceptional prediction performance, achieving R2 = 0.9984, MSE = 10-3, and MAE = 9.1 x 10-3 at a fixed value of the pressure at 20 kbar. The importance of this work lies in its potential to provide valuable insights for neither designing advanced quantum dot-based optoelectronic devices, such as infrared detectors and photonic components, where temperature-dependent NOR are properties crucial for performance optimization. Furthermore, the application of machine learning techniques in this context offers a promising approach for efficient and accurate modelling of complex quantum systems, facilitating the development of future quantum technologies.

TI Observation-dependent suppression and enhancement of two-photon
   coincidences by tailored losses
SO NATURE PHOTONICS
AB The ability of indistinguishable particles to interfere with one another is a core principle of quantum mechanics. The interplay of interference and particles exchange statistics1-4 gives rise to the Hong-Ou-Mandel (HOM) effect(5), where the bunching of bosons suppresses two-particle coincidences between the output ports of a balanced beamsplitter. Conversely, fermionic anti-bunching can yield up to a twofold enhancement of coincidences compared to the baseline of distinguishable particles. As such, the emergence of dips or peaks in the HOM effect may appear indicative of the particles' bosonic/ fermionic nature. Here, we demonstrate experimentally that the coincidence statistics of boson pairs can be seamlessly tuned from full suppression to enhancement by an appropriate choice of the observation basis. Our photonic setting leverages birefringent couplers(6) to introduce differential dissipation in the photons' polarization. In contrast to previous work(7-9Y), the mechanism underpinning this unusual behaviour does not act on individual phases accumulated by pairs of particles along specific paths, but instead allows them to jointly evade losses as indistinguishable photons are prevented from inhabiting orthogonal modes. Our findings reveal a new approach to harnessing non-Hermitian settings for the manipulation of multi-particle quantum states and as functional elements in quantum simulation.

AB The approximate degree of a Boolean function f:{0,1}n?{0,1} is the minimum degree of a real polynomial p that approximates f pointwise: |f(x)-p(x)|=1/3 for all x?{0,1}n. For any d>0, we construct DNF and CNF formulas of polynomial size with approximate degree O(n1-d), essentially matching the trivial upper bound of n. This fully resolves the approximate degree of constant-depth circuits (AC0), a question that has seen extensive research over the past 10 years. Prior to our work, an O(n1-d) lower bound was known only for AC0 circuits of depth that grows with 1/d (Bun and Thaler, FOCS 2017). Furthermore, the DNF and CNF formulas that we construct are the simplest possible in that they have constant width.
   Our result gives the first near-linear lower bounds on the bounded-error communication complexity of polynomial-size DNF and CNF formulas in the challenging k-party number-on-the-forehead model and two-party quantum model: O(n/4kk2)1-d and O(n1-d), respectively, where d>0 is any constant. Our lower bounds are essentially optimal. Analogous to above, such lower bounds were previously known only for AC0 circuits of depth that grows with 1/d.

TI Full multipartite steering inseparability, genuine multipartite
   steering, and monogamy for continuous-variable systems
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB We derive inequalities sufficient to detect the genuine N-partite steering of N distinct systems. Here, we are careful to distinguish between the concepts of full N-partite steering inseparability (where steering is confirmed individually for all bipartitions of the N systems, thus negating the bilocal hidden state model for each bipartition) and genuine N-partite steering (which excludes all convex combinations of the bilocal hidden state models). Other definitions of multipartite steering are possible and we also derive inequalities to detect a stricter genuine N-partite steering where only one site needs to be trusted. The inequalities are expressed as variances of quadrature phase amplitudes and thus apply to continuous-variable systems. We show how genuine N-partite steerable states can be created and detected for the nodes of a network formed from a single-mode squeezed state passed through a sequence of N - 1 beam splitters. A stronger genuine N-partite steering is created, if one uses two squeezed inputs or N squeezed inputs. We are able to confirm that genuine tripartite steering (by the above definition and by the stricter definition) has been realized experimentally. Finally, we analyze how bipartite steering and entanglement are distributed among the systems in the tripartite case, illustrating with monogamy inequalities. While we use Gaussian states to benchmark the criteria, the inequalities derived in this paper are not based on the assumption of Gaussian states, which gives an advantage for quantum communication protocols.

TI Near-noiseless and small-footprint phase sensitive optical parametric
   amplifier using AlGaAs-on-insulator waveguides
SO APPLIED OPTICS
AB Phase sensitive amplifiers (PSAs) based on optical parametric amplification feature near noiseless amplification, which is of considerable benefit for improving the performance of optical communication systems. Currently, the majority of research on PSAs is carried out on the basis of highly nonlinear fibers or periodically poled lithium niobite waveguides, with the impediments of being susceptible to environmental interference and requiring complex temperature control systems to maintain quasi-phase matching conditions, respectively. Here, a near-noiseless and small-footprint PSA based on dispersion-engineered AlGaAs-on-insulator (AlGaAsOI) waveguides is proposed and demonstrated theoretically. The phase-dependent gain and the phase-to-phase transfer function of the PSA are calculated to analyze its characteristics. Furthermore, we investigate in detail the effects of linear loss, nonlinear coefficient, and pump power on the PSA gain and noise figure (NF) in AlGaAsOI waveguides. The results show that a PSA based on an AlGaAsOI waveguide is feasible with a maximum phase sensitive gain of 33 dB, achieving an NF of less than 1 dB over a gain bandwidth of 245 nm with a gain of >15 dB, which completely covers the S + C + L band. This investigation is worthwhile for noiseless PSAs on photonic integrated chips, which are promising for low-noise optical amplification, multifunctional photonic integrated chips, quantum communication, and spectroscopy, and as a reference for low-noise PSAs depending on the third-order nonlinearity, chi((3)), of the waveguide material.

TI Investigation of 1064-nm Pumped Type II SPDC in Potassium Niobate for
   Generation of High Spectral Purity Photon Pairs
SO CRYSTALS
AB The generation and detection of nonclassical light of about 2 mu m has good potential in an emerging field of high-sensitivity metrology, especially gravitational wave detection, as well as free-space quantum communication. A pair of photons is generated through a spontaneous parametric down-conversion (SPDC) process in a nonlinear optic crystal, which can be properly entangled in a spatial region where two beams with each polarization overlap or in a Sagnac-loop interferometer configuration. We investigated theoretically and numerically Type II SPDC in a potassium niobate (KNbO3, KN) crystal, which is useful as a material platform for generating photon pairs of high spectral purity in the 2-mu m range. The technique is based on the frequency degenerate SPDC under Type II extended phase matching (EPM). We described the EPM characteristics of KN and showed that it is practically feasible for a 1064-nm pumped SPDC under moderate temperature conditions. The effective nonlinear optic coefficient of KN is at least four-times larger than those of other crystals using the Type II EPM approach, which implies a significant improvement in SPDC efficiency. The joint spectral analysis showed that a pair of photons can be generated with a high purity of 0.995 through proper pump filtering.

TI Sexual dimorphism in lung transcriptomic adaptations in fetal alcohol
   spectrum disorders
SO RESPIRATORY RESEARCH
AB Current fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD) studies primarily focus on alcohol's actions on the fetal brain although respiratory infections are a leading cause of morbidity/mortality in newborns. The limited studies examining the pulmonary adaptations in FASD demonstrate decreased surfactant protein A and alveolar macrophage phagocytosis, impaired differentiation, and increased risk of Group B streptococcal pneumonia with no study examining sexual dimorphism in adaptations. We hypothesized that developmental alcohol exposure in pregnancy will lead to sexually dimorphic fetal lung morphological and immune adaptations. Pregnant rats were orogastrically treated once daily with alcohol (4.5 g/kg, gestational day [GD] 4 to 10, peak BAC, 216 mg/dl; 6.0 g/kg, GD 11 to 20, peak BAC, 289 mg/dl) or 50% maltose dextrin (isocalorically matched pair-fed controls) to control for calories derived from ethanol. Male and female fetal lung RNA from a total of 20 dams were assessed using the TapeStation (Agilent) and Qubit RNA broad-range assay. Samples with RNA Integrity Numbers (RINs) > 8 were prepared using the NEBNext Poly(A) mRNA Magnetic Isolation Module (NEB), xGen Broad-range RNA Library Prep (IDT), and xGen Normalase UDI Primer Plate 2 (IDT). Final libraries were checked for quality and quantity by Qubit hsDNA and LabChip. The samples were sequenced on the Illumina NovaSeq S4 Paired-end 150 bp. Fetal lung tissue were analyzed for histopathological assessments. Mean fetal weight, crown-rump length and placental efficiency of the alcohol-administered rats were significantly lower (P < 0.05) than the pair-fed control pups. Differentially expressed genes indicated a sex-linked gene regulation dichotomy with a significantly higher number of genes altered in the female fetal lungs compared to the male. Network analysis plot of downregulated genes in the females exposed to alcohol in utero showed a negative impact on T cell activation and regulation, T cell differentiation, decrease in CD8+ T cell number etc. The most altered genes were Cd8b, Ccl25, Cd3e, Cd27, Cd247, Cd3d, Ccr9, Cd2, Cd8a and were decreased by a log2fold change of > 2 (P < 0.05) in the female fetal lungs. KEGG analyses showed that male and female fetal lungs had downregulated genes associated with development and mitosis, whereas the females alone showed dysregulation of T cell genes. Comparison of gross appearance and histopathologic morphology showed that the developing lungs of both male and female fetal pups, displayed stunted differentiation, were relatively hypoplastic, and displayed a diminution of alveolar size and air spaces. Similarly, in both sexes, decreased alveolar capillarization was also evident in the alcohol-exposed fetal lungs. These data provide novel information in a growing area focused on alcohol effects on the offspring lung and its influence on appropriate fetal/neonatal immune responses and highlights the importance of examining sexual dimorphism in developmental adaptations.

TI Optomechanical second-order sidebands and group delays in a spinning
   resonator with a parametric amplifier and non-Markovian effects
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB We investigate the generation of the frequency components at the second-order sidebands based on a spinning resonator containing a degenerate optical parametric amplifier (OPA). We show that an OPA driven by different pumping frequencies inside a cavity can enhance and modulate the amplitude of the second-order sideband with different influences. We find that both the second-order sideband amplitude and its associated group delay sensitively depend on the nonlinear gain of the OPA, the phase of the field driving the OPA, the rotation speed of the resonator, and the incident direction of the input fields. Tuning the pumping frequency of the OPA can remain the localization of the maximum value of the sideband efficiency and nonreciprocal behavior due to the optical Sagnac effect, which also can adjust the linewidth of the suppressive window of the second-order sideband. Furthermore, we extend the study of the second-order sideband to the non-Markovian bath, which consists of a collection of infinite oscillators (bosonic photonic modes). We illustrate that the second-order sidebands in a spinning resonator exhibit a transition from the non-Markovian to the Markovian regime by controlling the environmental spectral width. We also study the influences of the decay from the non-Markovian environment coupling to an external reservoir on the efficiency of second-order upper sidebands. This indicates a promising way to enhance or steer optomechanically induced transparency devices in nonlinear optical cavities and provides potential applications for precision measurement, optical communications, and quantum sensing.

TI Quantum-enhanced receiver for quadrature phase shift keying using
   conjugated homodyne detection
SO EPJ QUANTUM TECHNOLOGY
AB Coherent detection (homodyne detection/heterodyne detection) and single photon detection are commonly applied in classical communication and quantum communication/receiver respectively. In this paper, we firstly propose a quantum-enhanced receiver based on conjugated homodyne detection, which is consisted of two classical balanced homodyne detectors, for discrimination among quadrature-phase-modulated weak coherent states. Our detection part works as a photon counter in every single-shot measurement during the process of detection and feedback, which could help our quantum-enhanced receiver surpass the standard quantum limit when an optimized detection threshold t from 0.05 to 0.3 is selected. Moreover, our proposed quantum-enhanced receiver with conjugated homodyne detectors can obtain the same low error probability as conventional quantum-enhanced receivers (with its superconducting nanowire single photon detectors' detection efficiency 60% for pulse separation M = 8 and 70% for M = 12 under the same adaptive feedback countermeasures.) Meanwhile, our scheme of the quantum-enhanced receiver gains its incomparable advantages on room-temperature working condition and low cost due to the application of conjugated homodyne detectors. As far as we concerned, this is the first time to explore the performance of the quantum-enhanced receiver with commercial homodyne detectors. And the analysis in this paper may pave the way to reduce the cost of the quantum-enhanced receiver and make it more adaptable for long-distance optical communication systems.

TI Self-Cooling Molecular Spin Qudits
SO ADVANCED MATERIALS
AB The need of operating molecular spin qubits at very low temperatures constitutes a technological limitation. This challenge is addressed by integrating, in the same material and at the molecular scale, quantum processing and magnetic refrigeration capabilities. The molecular unit is a [GdEr] heterolanthanide coordination complex, where Er(III) encodes a qubit while Gd(III) provides a large magnetocaloric effect. The properties of each component are separately studied in isostructural [LaEr] and [GdLu] complexes, where each functional ion lies next to a diamagnetic metal. All complexes are characterized by magnetic, heat capacity, and EPR measurements. The results show that the presence of both ions in the same molecule has a synergic effect on both functionalities. Thus, the coupling between Er(III) and Gd(III) spins lifts any level degeneracies even close to zero magnetic field, leading to a d = 16 set of spin states that, as revealed by pulse EPR measurements, can be coherently manipulated. In turn, Er(III) enhances the magnetocaloric effect compared to [GdLu], extending it to lower temperatures. This is corroborated by direct magnetocaloric measurements, which show the ability of this material to cool itself, and a device, down to temperatures as low as 0.4 K.

TI Retrieving space-dependent polarization transformations via near-optimal
   quantum process tomography
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB An optical waveplate rotating light polarization can be modeled as a single-qubit unitary operator. This analogy can be exploited to experimentally retrieve a polarization transformation within the paradigm of quantum process tomography. Standard approaches to tomographic problems rely on the maximum-likelihood estimation, providing the most likely transformation to yield the same outcomes as a set of experimental projective measurements. The performances of this method strongly depend on the number of input measurements and the numerical minimization routine that is adopted. Here we investigate the application of genetic and machine learning approaches to this problem, finding that both allow for accurate reconstructions and fast operations when processing a set of projective measurements very close to the minimal one. We apply these techniques to the case of space-dependent polarization transformations, providing an experimental characterization of the optical action of spin-orbit metasurfaces having patterned birefringence. Our efforts thus expand the toolbox of methodologies for optical process tomography. In particular, we find that the neural network-based scheme provides a significant speed-up, that may be critical in applications requiring a characterization in real-time. We expect these results to lay the groundwork for the optimization of tomographic approaches in more general quantum processes, including non-unitary gates and operations in higher-dimensional Hilbert spaces.

TI Innovative Trends in the 6G Era: A Comprehensive Survey of Architecture,
   Applications, Technologies, and Challenges
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB While the fifth-generation mobile network is being commercialized worldwide, researchers have recently started looking towards the next generation, called the 6G network. Unlike 5G and previous generations of wireless technologies designed to improve network performance for greater bandwidth, lower latency, and greater reliability, 6G ecosystems are considered a platform conducive to innovations in computing, artificial intelligence, connectivity and sensors, virtualization, and more. It is designed to meet the requirements of higher global coverage, greater spectral efficiency, and a reduced carbon footprint, emphasizing sustainability, equity, trust, and security through unprecedented architectural evolutions and technology. 6G will be an integrated network system that includes a traditional terrestrial mobile network, space network, and underwater network to provide ubiquitous network access. Even if studies on the vision of the 6G network have already been published, there is still a significant amount of ground to cover. There is no decision made yet regarding anything, and nothing has been ruled out. The focus of this study is to identify a complete picture of changes in architectures, technologies, and challenges that will shape the 6G network. The research results will provide indications for further studies on 6G ecosystems.

TI Revealing room temperature ferromagnetism in exfoliated
   Fe5GeTe2 flakes with quantum magnetic imaging
SO 2D MATERIALS
AB Van der Waals (vdW) material Fe5GeTe2, with its long-range ferromagnetic ordering near room temperature, has significant potential to become an enabling platform for implementing novel spintronic and quantum devices. To pave the way for applications, it is crucial to determine the magnetic properties when the thickness of Fe5GeTe2 reaches the few-layers regime. However, this is highly challenging due to the need for a characterization technique that is local, highly sensitive, artifact-free, and operational with minimal fabrication. Prior studies have indicated that Curie temperature T (C) can reach up to close to room temperature for exfoliated Fe5GeTe2 flakes, as measured via electrical transport; there is a need to validate these results with a measurement that reveals magnetism more directly. In this work, we investigate the magnetic properties of exfoliated thin flakes of vdW magnet Fe5GeTe2 via quantum magnetic imaging technique based on nitrogen vacancy centers in diamond. Through imaging the stray fields, we confirm room-temperature magnetic order in Fe5GeTe2 thin flakes with thickness down to 7 units cell. The stray field patterns and their response to magnetizing fields with different polarities is consistent with previously reported perpendicular easy-axis anisotropy. Furthermore, we perform imaging at different temperatures and determine the Curie temperature of the flakes at approximate to 300 K. These results provide the basis for realizing a room-temperature monolayer ferromagnet with Fe5GeTe2. This work also demonstrates that the imaging technique enables rapid screening of multiple flakes simultaneously as well as time-resolved imaging for monitoring time-dependent magnetic behaviors, thereby paving the way towards high throughput characterization of potential two-dimensional (2D) magnets near room temperature and providing critical insights into the evolution of domain behaviors in 2D magnets due to degradation.

TI Non-invasive visualisation of long-lasting brain metabolic alterations
   in murine pseudo-infection model using parahydrogen-polarised
   [1-13C] pyruvate MRI
SO DISCOVER NANO
AB Long-lasting neurological issues, including cognitive impairment, anxiety, and depression, that persist after recovery from acute inflammatory diseases, such as infections, have become a significant social problem, particularly following the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic. Various diagnostic techniques and biomarkers have been explored to objectively evaluate brain symptoms associated with infection-induced local or systemic inflammatory responses (i.e. immune fatigue); however, their detection capabilities remain limited. Here we investigated whether magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) combined with a quantum-sensed molecule, parahydrogen-polarised [1-C-13] pyruvate, could detect persistent brain metabolic alterations in a murine pseudo-infection model induced by polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid (Poly(I: C)), a Toll-like receptor 3 ligand. Significant alterations in brain pyruvate metabolism favouring glycolysis were observed in both the acute and late phases of the pseudo-infection model, with a 12.7% and 2.5% decrease in bicarbonate flux, and a 58.4% and 32.2% increase in lactate flux on day 3 and week 2, respectively. These brain metabolic changes were accompanied by diminished dopamine signal markers in the striatum and nigra/ventral tegmental areas and reduced spontaneous nocturnal locomotor activity. A biochemical analysis of energy metabolic markers consistently supported the reprogramming of brain glucose metabolism, showing the suppression of oxidative phosphorylation during the acute phase and promotion of glycolysis during the late phase of Poly(I: C) treatment. Hyperpolarised 13C MRI of pyruvate metabolism is a promising non-invasive imaging biomarker for brain issues during the late phase of systemic infections and other neurodegenerative and psychiatric diseases, particularly in conditions lacking discernible morphological abnormalities.

TI Photoluminescence spectrum of divacancy in porous and nanocrystalline
   cubic silicon carbide
SO JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYSICS
AB The divacancy in silicon carbide (SiC) is a prominent solid state defect quantum bit that bears a relatively strong fluorescence and optically detected magnetic resonance contrast (ODMR) at room temperature. These properties exemplify it for quantum sensing of biological molecules. To this end, we previously developed a top-down method to create divacancies in cubic SiC nanoparticles (NPs) as non-perturbative ODMR biomarkers. In this process, large SiC particles are synthesized and then stain etched to form porous SiC and then ultrasonication and filtering are applied to the solution to extract few nanometer diameter SiC NPs. We called this process no-photon exciton generation chemistry (NPEGEC). We showed that by adding aluminum to carbon and silicon in the synthesis process of cubic SiC, one can engineer divacancy defects in SiC NPs by NPEGEC. An alternative traditional way to introduce vacancies to the SiC lattice is irradiation. Here, we compare the fluorescence spectra of divacancies as created by neutron irradiation in porous cubic SiC and NPEGEC technique in SiC NPs, and the results are analyzed in detail by means of first principles calculations. We find that the irradiation technique produces a larger shift in the fluorescence spectrum with residual background fluorescence than that for divacancies in SiC NPs, which is most likely caused by the parasitic defects left after irradiation and annealing in the former sample. These results imply that the chemistry technique applied to prepare divacancies in few nanometer SiC NPs may preserve the bulk-like quality of divacancy quantum bits near the surface.& nbsp;(c) 2022 Author(s).

TI The MOCAST plus Study on a Quantum Gradiometry Satellite Mission with
   Atomic Clocks
SO SURVEYS IN GEOPHYSICS
AB In the past twenty years, satellite gravimetry missions have successfully provided data for the determination of the Earth static gravity field (GOCE) and its temporal variations (GRACE and GRACE-FO). In particular, the possibility to study the evolution in time of Earth masses allows us to monitor global parameters underlying climate changes, water resources, flooding, melting of ice masses and the corresponding global sea level rise, all of which are of paramount importance, providing basic data on, e.g. geodynamics, earthquakes, hydrology or ice sheets changes. Recently, a large interest has developed in novel technologies and quantum sensing, which promise higher sensitivity, drift-free measurements, and higher absolute accuracy for both terrestrial surveys and space missions, giving direct access to more precise long-term measurements. Looking at a time frame beyond the present decade, in the MOCAST+ study (MOnitoring mass variations by Cold Atom Sensors and Time measures) a satellite mission based on an "enhanced" quantum payload is proposed, with cold atom interferometers acting as gravity gradiometers, and atomic clocks for optical frequency measurements, providing observations of differences of the gravitational potential. The main outcomes are the definition of the accuracy level to be expected from this payload and the accuracy level needed to detect and monitor phenomena identified in the Scientific Challenges of the ESA Living Planet Program, in particular Cryosphere, Ocean and Solid Earth. In this paper, the proposed payload, mission profile and preliminary platform design are presented, with end-to-end simulation results and assessment of the impact on geophysical applications.

TI Active and tunable nanophotonic metamaterials
SO NANOPHOTONICS
AB Metamaterials enable subwavelength tailoring of light-matter interactions, driving fundamental discoveries which fuel novel applications in areas ranging from compressed sensing to quantum engineering. Importantly, the metallic and dielectric resonators from which static metamaterials are comprised present an open architecture amenable to materials integration. Thus, incorporating responsive materials such as semiconductors, liquid crystals, phase-change materials, or quantum materials (e.g., superconductors, 2D materials, etc.) imbue metamaterials with dynamic properties, facilitating the development of active and tunable devices harboring enhanced or even entirely novel electromagnetic functionality. Ultimately, active control derives from the ability to craft the local electromagnetic fields; accomplished using a host of external stimuli to modify the electronic or optical properties of the responsive materials embedded into the active regions of the subwavelength resonators. We provide a broad overview of this frontier area of metamaterials research, introducing fundamental concepts and presenting control strategies that include electronic, optical, mechanical, thermal, and magnetic stimuli. The examples presented range from microwave to visible wavelengths, utilizing a wide range of materials to realize spatial light modulators, effective nonlinear media, on-demand optics, and polarimetric imaging as but a few examples. Often, active and tunable nanophotonic metamaterials yield an emergent electromagnetic response that is more than the sum of the parts, providing reconfigurable or real-time control of the amplitude, phase, wavevector, polarization, and frequency of light. The examples to date are impressive, setting the stage for future advances that are likely to impact holography, beyond 5G communications, imaging, and quantum sensing and transduction.

TI Krylov complexity of density matrix operators
SO JOURNAL OF HIGH ENERGY PHYSICS
AB Quantifying complexity in quantum systems has witnessed a surge of interest in recent years, with Krylov-based measures such as Krylov complexity (C K ) and Spread complexity (C S ) gaining prominence. In this study, we investigate their interplay by considering the complexity of states represented by density matrix operators. After setting up the problem, we analyze a handful of analytical and numerical examples spanning generic two-dimensional Hilbert spaces, qubit states, quantum harmonic oscillators, and random matrix theories, uncovering insightful relationships. For generic pure states, our analysis reveals two key findings: (I) a correspondence between moment-generating functions (of Lanczos coefficients) and survival amplitudes, and (II) an early-time equivalence between C K and 2C S . Furthermore, for maximally entangled pure states, we find that the moment-generating function of C K becomes the Spectral Form Factor and, at late-times, C K is simply related to NC S for N >= 2 within the N-dimensional Hilbert space. Notably, we confirm that C K = 2C S holds across all times when N = 2. Through the lens of random matrix theories, we also discuss deviations between complexities at intermediate times and highlight subtleties in the averaging approach at the level of the survival amplitude.

TI Quantum-brachistochrone approach to the conversion from W to
   Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger states for Rydberg-atom qubits
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Using the quantum-brachistochrone formalism, we address the problem of finding the fastest possible (time-optimal) deterministic conversion between W and Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) states in a system of three identical and equidistant neutral atoms that are acted upon by four external laser pulses. Assuming that all four pulses are close to being resonant with the same internal (atomic) transition-the one between the atomic ground state and a high-lying Rydberg state-each atom can be treated as an effective two-level system (gr-type qubit). Starting from an effective system Hamiltonian, which is valid in the Rydberg-blockade regime and defined on a four-state manifold, we derive the quantum-brachistochrone equations pertaining to the fastest possible W-to-GHZ state conversion. By numerically solving these equations, we determine the time-dependent Rabi frequencies of external laser pulses that correspond to the time-optimal state conversion. In particular, we show that the shortest possible W-to-GHZ state-conversion time is given by T-QB = 6.8 h/E, where E is the total laser-pulse energy used, this last time being significantly shorter than the state-conversion times previously found using a dynamical-symmetry-based approach [T-DS = (1.33 - 1.66) T-QB].

TI Stability, metallicity, and magnetism in niobium silicide nanofilms
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW MATERIALS
AB Modern superconducting qubits based on two-dimensional (2D) transmons typically involve the growth of Nb thin films on high-resistivity Si substrates. Since imperfections at the Nb-Si heterointerface have been implicated as a source of two-level systems that limit quantum coherence times, detailed characterization and understanding of niobium silicide interfacial layers are critical to improving superconducting qubit technology. While bulk binary intermetallic niobium silicide phases are well understood, the thermodynamic phase stability and properties of ultrathin niobium silicides, such as those found at the Nb-Si heterointerface in 2D transmons, have not yet been explored. Here, we report finite-sized effects for ultrathin niobium silicide films using density functional theory calculations and predict nanoscale stabilization of Nb6Si5 over the bulk alpha-Nb5Si3 phase. This result is consistent with our experimental observations of a niobium silicide interfacial layer between a sputtered Nb thin film and the underlying Si substrate. Furthermore, our calculations show that Nb6Si5 nanofilms are nonmagnetic, making them superior to nanofilms of alpha-Nb5Si3 that exhibit antiferromagnetic correlations detrimental to long coherence times in superconducting qubits. By providing atomic-scale insight into niobium silicide nanofilms, this paper can help guide ongoing efforts to optimize Nb-Si heterointerfaces for long coherence times in superconducting qubits.

TI Heat Modulation on Target Thermal Bath via Coherent Auxiliary Bath
SO ENTROPY
AB We study a scheme of thermal management where a three-qubit system assisted with a coherent auxiliary bath (CAB) is employed to implement heat management on a target thermal bath (TTB). We consider the CAB/TTB being ensemble of coherent/thermal two-level atoms (TLAs), and within the framework of collision model investigate the characteristics of steady heat current (also called target heat current (THC)) between the system and the TTB. It demonstrates that with the help of the quantum coherence of ancillae the magnitude and direction of heat current can be controlled only by adjusting the coupling strength of system-CAB. Meanwhile, we also show that the influences of quantum coherence of ancillae on the heat current strongly depend on the coupling strength of system-CAB, and the THC becomes positively/negatively correlated with the coherence magnitude of ancillae when the coupling strength below/over some critical value. Besides, the system with the CAB could serve as a multifunctional device integrating the thermal functions of heat amplifier, suppressor, switcher and refrigerator, while with thermal auxiliary bath it can only work as a thermal suppressor. Our work provides a new perspective for the design of multifunctional thermal device utilizing the resource of quantum coherence from the CAB.

TI Witnessing negative conditional entropy
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Quantum states that possess negative conditional von Neumann entropy provide quantum advantage in several information-theoretic protocols including superdense coding, state merging, distributed private randomness distillation, and one-way entanglement distillation. While entanglement is an important resource, only a subset of entangled states have negative conditional von Neumann entropy. In this work, we characterize the class of density matrices having non-negative conditional von Neumann entropy as convex and compact. This allows us to prove the existence of a Hermitian operator (a witness) for the detection of states having negative conditional entropy for bipartite systems in arbitrary dimensions. We show two constructions of such witnesses. For one of the constructions, the expectation value of the witness in a state is an upper bound to the conditional entropy of the state. We pose the problem of obtaining a tight upper bound to the set of conditional entropies of states in which an operator gives the same expectation value. We solve this convex optimization problem numerically for a two qubit case and find that this enhances the usefulness of our witnesses. We also find that for a particular witness, the estimated tight upper bound matches the value of conditional entropy for Werner states. We explicate the utility of our work in the detection of useful states in several protocols.

TI A Diamond Heater-Thermometer Microsensor for Measuring Localized Thermal
   Conductivity: A Case Study in Gelatin Hydrogel
SO ADVANCED OPTICAL MATERIALS
AB Understanding the microscopic thermal effects of the hydrogel is important for its application in diverse fields, including thermal-related studies in tissue engineering and thermal management for flexible electronic devices. In recent decades, localized thermal properties, such as thermal conductivity, have often been overlooked due to technical limitations. To tackle this, the study proposes a new hybrid diamond microsensor that is capable of simultaneous temperature control and readout in a decoupled manner. Specifically, the sensor consists of a silicon pillar (heater) at approximate to 10 microns in length, topped by a micron-sized diamond particle that contains silicon-vacancy (SiV) centers (thermometer) with 1.29 KHz-12${\mathrm{K}} {\mathrm{H}}{{{\mathrm{z}}}<^>{ - \frac{1}{2}}}$ temperature measurement sensitivity. Combining this innovative, scalable sensor with a newly established simulation model that can transform heating-laser-induced temperature change into thermal conductivity, an all-optical decoupled method is introduced with approximate to 0.05 W m-1 K-1 precision, which can reduce laser crosstalk. For the first time, the thermal conductivity change of hydrogels during the gelation process is tracked and the existence of variation is demonstrated. The study introduces a rapid, undisturbed technique for measuring microscale thermal conductivity, potentially serving as a valuable tool for cellular thermometry, and highlights the idea that decoupling can reduce crosstalk from different lasers, which is helpful for quantum sensing.
   The study introduces a novel hybrid diamond microsensor with decoupled temperature control and readout for microscale thermal conductivity measurement in hydrogels. This sensor enhances precision in thermal studies and is crucial for applications in tissue engineering and flexible electronics, demonstrating significant advancements in microscale thermometry. image

AB Research on biodegradable zinc requires thorough in vitro cytotoxicity screening as the developed materials are being proposed for various medical implants, including stents. This study investigates the endothelial cell response to a novel Zn-0.8Mg alloy produced via hydrostatic extrusion (HSE), aiming to showcase the impact of plastic deformation on the cytocompatibility of biodegradable zinc-based materials. In doing so, the MTT test for cell viability studies as well as confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) imaging for cell morphology analysis were used. In addition, a cutting-edge diamond-based quantum sensing technique, i.e., T1 relaxometry, was employed to reveal the nanoscale impact of ions on cells. It was demonstrated that the HSE-produced materials exhibited a 10-fold decrease in grain size, microstructural homogenization, and consequently more uniform degradation compared to hot extruded, coarse-grained materials. Despite these differences, the MTT and CLSM data did not show any drastic discrepancies between the endothelial cell response to any of the investigated materials. However, T1 relaxometry measurements indicated that plastic deformation might influence the cytocompatibility of biodegradable zinc-based materials, as evidenced by significant intracellular free radical production in endothelial cells exposed to ions released from the Zn-0.8Mg HSE alloy surface. Overall, no adverse effects of plastic deformation on the cytocompatibility of zinc-based materials were found as free radical generation may play a beneficial role in endothelial cell function, suggesting a complex interaction between material degradation and cellular response.
   T1 relaxometry revealed the impact of plastic deformation on the cytocompatibility of biodegradable Zn-Mg alloy, i.e., the elevated production of free radicals in endothelial cells, the phenomenon associated with stable material degradation.

TI Long-range exchange interaction between spin qubits mediated by a
   superconducting link at finite magnetic field
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
AB Solid-state spin qubits are promising candidates for the realization of a quantum computer due to their long coherence times and easy electrical manipulation. However, spin-spin interactions, which are needed for entangling gates, have only limited range as they generally rely on tunneling between neighboring quantum dots. This severely constrains scalability. Proposals to extend the interaction range generally focus on coherent electron transport between dots or on extending the coupling range. Here, we study a setup in which such an extension is obtained by using a superconductor as a quantum mediator. Because of its gap, the superconductor effectively acts as a long tunnel barrier. We analyze the impact of spin-orbit (SO) coupling, external magnetic fields, and the geometry of the superconductor. We show that while spin-nonconserving tunneling between the dots and the superconductor due to SO coupling does not affect the exchange interaction, strong SO scattering in the superconducting bulk is detrimental. Moreover, we find that the addition of an external magnetic field decreases the strength of the exchange interaction. Fortunately, the geometry of the superconducting link offers a lot of room to optimize the interaction range, with gains of over an order of magnitude from a two-dimensional (2D) film to a quasi-1D strip. We estimate that for superconductors with weak SO coupling (e.g., aluminum), exchange rates of up to 100 MHz over a micron-scale range can be achieved with this setup in the presence of magnetic fields of the order of 100 mT.

TI Unified framework for open quantum dynamics with memory
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB The dynamics of quantum systems coupled to baths are typically studied using the Nakajima-Zwanzig memory kernel (K\documentclass[12pt]{minimal} \usepackage{amsmath} \usepackage{wasysym} \usepackage{amsfonts} \usepackage{amssymb} \usepackage{amsbsy} \usepackage{mathrsfs} \usepackage{upgreek} \setlength{\oddsidemargin}{-69pt} \begin{document}$${{{\bf{{{{\mathcal{K}}}}}}}}$$\end{document}) or the influence functions (I), particularly when memory effects are present. Despite their significance, formal connections between the two have not been explicitly known. We establish their connections by examining the system propagator for a N-level system linearly coupled to Gaussian baths with various types of system-bath coupling. For a certain class of problems, we devised a non-perturbative, diagrammatic approach to construct K\documentclass[12pt]{minimal} \usepackage{amsmath} \usepackage{wasysym} \usepackage{amsfonts} \usepackage{amssymb} \usepackage{amsbsy} \usepackage{mathrsfs} \usepackage{upgreek} \setlength{\oddsidemargin}{-69pt} \begin{document}$${{{\bf{{{{\mathcal{K}}}}}}}}$$\end{document} from I for (driven) systems interacting with Gaussian baths, bypassing conventional projection-free dynamics inputs. Our work provides a way to interpret approximate path integral methods in terms of approximate memory kernels. Moreover, it offers a Hamiltonian learning procedure to extract the bath spectral density from reduced system trajectories, opening new avenues in quantum sensing and engineering. The insights we provide advance our understanding of non-Markovian dynamics and will serve as a stepping stone for future theoretical and experimental developments in this area.
   The Feynman-Vernon Path Integral and the Generalized Quantum Master Equation are the two main and oldest approaches to open quantum system dynamics modelling. Here, the authors discover a formal link between them, and use it to find a Hamiltonian learning method that can extract environmental spectral densities from the dynamics of the reduced system.

TI On the optimality of the radical-pair quantum compass
SO QUANTUM SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB Quantum sensing enables the ultimate precision attainable in parameter estimation. Circumstantial evidence suggests that certain organisms, most notably migratory songbirds, also harness quantum-enhanced magnetic field sensing via a radical-pair-based chemical compass for the precise detection of the weak geomagnetic field. However, what underpins the acuity of such a compass operating in a noisy biological setting, at physiological temperatures, remains an open question. Here, we address the fundamental limits of inferring geomagnetic field directions from radical-pair spin dynamics. Specifically, we compare the compass precision, as derived from the directional dependence of the radical-pair recombination yield, to the ultimate precision potentially realisable by a quantum measurement on the spin system under steady-state conditions. To this end, we probe the quantum Fisher information and associated Cram & eacute;r-Rao bound in spin models of realistic complexity, accounting for complex inter-radical interactions, a multitude of hyperfine couplings, and asymmetric recombination kinetics, as characteristic for the magnetosensory protein cryptochrome. We compare several models implicated in cryptochrome magnetoreception and unveil their optimality through the precision of measurements ostensibly accessible to nature. Overall, the comparison provides insight into processes honed by nature to realise optimality whilst constrained to operating with mere reaction yields. Generally, the inference of compass orientation from recombination yields approaches optimality in the limits of complexity, yet levels off short of the theoretical optimal precision bounds by up to one or two orders of magnitude, thus underscoring the potential for improving on design principles inherent to natural systems.

TI Critical Quantum Metrology in a Stabilized Two-Photon Rabi Model
SO ADVANCED QUANTUM TECHNOLOGIES
AB Applications of quantum systems with non-linear light-matter interaction have to deal with a peculiar instability in the ultra- and deep strong coupling regime, the so-called "spectral collapse." To solve this problem, the present work investigates a generalized quantum Rabi model (QRM) with two- and four-photon terms in view of applications for critical quantum metrology. In the introduced model, the spectral collapse occurring in the standard two-photon QRM is stabilized by the presence of the quartic potential. The collapse is then transformed into a quantum phase transition, which occurs in the low-frequency limit of the light mode, whose remnant at finite ratio between qubit and mode frequencies can be applied to critically enhanced quantum metrology. It is found that the four-photon term entails a much higher measurement precision compared to the standard two-photon QRM. The mechanism behind the higher precision can be traced to the different behavior of the ground state wave function as the system is tuned through the transition. As the standard two-photon QRM, despite the absence of the spectral collapse, the proposed model allows for a finite preparation time for the probe state (PTPS).

TI Electrical control of the g tensor of the first hole in a silicon MOS
   quantum dot
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
AB Single holes confined in semiconductor quantum dots are a promising platform for spin-qubit technology, due to the electrical tunability of the g factor of holes. However, the underlying mechanisms that enable electric spin control remain unclear due to the complexity of hole-spin states. Here, we study the underlying hole-spin physics of the first hole in a silicon planar metal-oxide-semiconductor (MOS) quantum dot. We show that nonuniform electrode-induced strain produces nanometer-scale variations in the heavy-hole-light-hole (HH-LH) splitting. Importantly, we find that this nonuniform strain causes the HH-LH splitting to vary by up to 50% across the active region of the quantum dot. We show that local electric fields can be used to displace the hole relative to the nonuniform strain profile, allowing a mechanism for electric modulation of the hole g tensor. Using this mechanism, we demonstrate tuning of the hole g factor by up to 500%. In addition, we observe a potential sweet spot where dg(110)/dV = 0, offering a configuration to suppress spin decoherence caused by electrical noise. These results open a path towards a technology involving engineering of nonuniform strains to optimize spin-based devices.

TI Efficient quantum state estimation with low-rank matrix completion

AB This paper introduces a novel and efficient technique for quantum state estimation, coined as low-rank matrix-completion quantum state tomography for characterizing pure quantum states, as it requires only non-entangling bases and 2n+1\documentclass[12pt]{minimal} \usepackage{amsmath} \usepackage{wasysym} \usepackage{amsfonts} \usepackage{amssymb} \usepackage{amsbsy} \usepackage{mathrsfs} \usepackage{upgreek} \setlength{\oddsidemargin}{-69pt} \begin{document}$2n + 1$\end{document} local Pauli operators. This significantly reduces the complexity of the process and increases the accuracy of the state estimation, as it eliminates the need for the entangling bases, which are experimentally difficult to implement on quantum devices. The required minimal post-processing, improved accuracy and efficacy of this matrix-completion-based method make it an ideal benchmarking tool for investigating the properties of quantum systems, enabling researchers to verify the accuracy of quantum devices, characterize their performance, and explore the underlying physics of quantum phenomena. Our numerical results demonstrate that this method outperforms contemporary techniques in its ability to accurately reconstruct multi-qubit quantum states on real quantum devices, making it an invaluable contribution to the field of quantum state characterization and an essential step toward the reliable deployment of intermediate- and large-scale quantum devices.

TI Zero damping effect of magnetic bilayer in microwave resonant cavity
SO ACTA PHYSICA SINICA
AB Experimental and theoretical studies have shown that a single magnon mode and cavity photon can be coupled coherently and dissipatively, with the interference between two types of coupling creating zero damping effect. In magnetic bilayers or multilayers, there exists more than one magnon mode which can be directly coupled by interface exchange interaction. In this work, a single-magnon mode is extended to a two-magnon mode and the effect of the two-magnon mode on zero damping condition is investigated. Using eigenfrequency analysis and microwave transmission spectra, the analytical expressions of the zero damping condition and the frequency detuning can be derived. By comparing analytical results with numerical results, the dependence of zero damping condition on system parameters can be obtained. In the absence of direct interface exchange magnon-magnon coupling, the zero damping condition occurs for dissipative coupling or hybrid coupling. As the coupling strength increases, the distance between two zero damping points increases. For hybrid coupling, the two zero damping points turn no longer symmetric, which is different from the case of pure coupling. Moreover, the effect of interface exchange magnon-magnon interaction on zero damping condition is studied. The interface exchange coupling results in the splitting of microwave transmission spectra, but the zero damping condition occurs only in the low-frequency mode. As the interface exchange coupling strength increases, the frequency at which the zero damping condition happens will shift toward lower frequency. Due to extremely narrow linewidth of microwave transmission dip under the zero damping condition, the result in this work is expected to be useful for designing the magnon-based quantum sensing devices.

TI The Influence of Crystal Anisotropy in Femtosecond Laser Processing of
   Single-Crystal Diamond
SO NANOMATERIALS
AB The single-crystal diamond (SCD), owing to its extreme physical and chemical properties, serves as an ideal substrate for quantum sensing and high-frequency devices. However, crystal anisotropy imposes significant challenges on fabricating high-quality micro-nano structures, directly impacting device performance. This work investigates the effects of femtosecond laser processing on the SCD under two distinct crystallographic orientations via single-pulse ablation. The results reveal that ablation craters along the <100> orientation exhibit an elliptical shape with the major axis parallel to the laser polarization, whereas those along the <110> orientation form near-circular craters with the major axis at a 45 degrees angle to the polarization. The single-pulse ablation threshold of the SCD along <110> is 9.56 J/cm(2), representing a 7.8% decrease compared to 10.32 J/cm(2) for <100>. The graphitization threshold shows a more pronounced reduction, dropping from 4.79 J/cm(2) to 3.31 J/cm(2) (31% decrease), accompanied by enhanced sp(2) carbon order evidenced by the significantly intensified G-band in the Raman spectra. In addition, a phase transition layer of amorphous carbon at the nanoscale in the surface layer (thickness of similar to 40 nm) and a narrow lattice spacing of 0.36 nm are observed under TEM, corresponding to the interlayer (002) plane of graphite. These observations are attributed to the orientation-dependent energy deposition efficiency. Based on these findings, an optimized crystallographic orientation selection strategy for femtosecond laser processing is proposed to improve the quality of functional micro-nano structures in the SCD.

TI Measuring free radicals with relaxometry: Pioneering steps for
   measurements in human semen
SO DIAMOND AND RELATED MATERIALS
AB A possible biological mechanism for unexplained male infertility is due to the effect of oxidative stress (OS), defined by the imbalance of reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, and the capacity of the antioxidant defence system to counteract it. In physiological concentrations, ROS and especially free radicals play an essential role in sperm maturation and fertilization, while an overabundance could lead to OS-induced damage to spermatozoa. To date, there are no direct detection techniques available that can measure the total amount of free radicals real time and identify where and when free radicals are generated. This study applies a quantum sensing technique using fluorescent nanodiamonds (FNDs), called T1 relaxometry, which is uniquely sensitive and specific for free radicals allowing measurements of the current radical load for nanoscale detection in living cells and body fluids. This proof-of-principle study investigates if we can use this technique to detect the free radical generation in human whole and separated, using density gradient centrifugation, semen. This method could be potentially used as new diagnostic measure for unexplained infertility or to track the effect of therapeutic interventions such as lifestyle changes. We adapted the existing relaxometry technique to measure free radicals in semen. The measured relaxation time (T1 time) was correlated to sperm concentration and progressive motility. Additionally, we explored the influence of the oxidative trigger hydrogen peroxide and the antioxidant glutathione on the free radical concentration measured. No significant correlations were found, which indicates that measurements in more proximity of the sperm cell are required to use relaxometry as a potential diagnostic tool for unexplained male infertility.

TI Reality variation under monitoring with weak measurements
SO QUANTUM INFORMATION PROCESSING
AB Recently, inspired by Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen's notion of elements of reality, Bilobran and Angelo gave a formal and operational characterization of (ir)reality [EPL 112, 40005 (2015)]. From this approach, the authors were able to define a measure of (ir)realism, or (in)definiteness, of an observable given a preparation of a quantum system. As well, in [Phys. Rev. A 97, 022107 (2018)], Dieguez and Angelo studied the variation of reality of observables by introducing a map, called monitoring, through weak projective non-revealed measurements. The authors showed that an arbitrary-intensity unrevealed measurement of a given observable X generally increases its reality, also increasing the reality of its incompatible observables X'. However, from these results, natural questions arise: under the monitoring map of X, how much does the reality of X' increase in comparison with that of X? Does it always increase? This is the kind of question we address in this article. Surprisingly, we show that it is possible that the variation of the reality of X' is bigger than the variation of the reality of X. As well, the monitoring map of X does not affect the already established reality of X', even when they are maximally incompatible. On the other hand, there are circumstances where the variation of reality of both observables is the same, even when they are maximally incompatible. Besides, we give a quantum circuit to implement the monitoring map and use it to experimentally verify the variation of reality of observables using IBM's quantum computers.

TI Stroboscopic x-ray diffraction microscopy of dynamic strain in diamond
   thin-film bulk acoustic resonators for quantum control of
   nitrogen-vacancy centers
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW APPLIED
AB Bulk-mode acoustic waves in a crystalline material exert lattice strain through the thickness of the sample, which couples to the spin Hamiltonian of defect-based qubits such as the nitrogen-vacancy (N-V) V ) center defect in diamond. This mechanism has previously been harnessed for unconventional quantum spin control, spin decoherence protection, and quantum sensing. Bulk-mode acoustic wave devices are also important in the microelectronics industry as microwave filters. A key challenge in both applications is a lack of appropriate operando microscopy tools for quantifying and visualizing gigahertz-frequency dynamic strain. In this work, we directly image acoustic strain within N-V V center-coupled diamond thinfilm bulk acoustic wave resonators using stroboscopic scanning hard x-ray diffraction microscopy at the Advanced Photon Source. The far-field scattering patterns of the nanofocused x-ray diffraction encode strain information entirely through the illuminated thickness of the resonator. These patterns have a real-space spatial variation that is consistent with the bulk strain's expected modal distribution and a momentum-space angular variation from which the strain amplitude can be quantitatively deduced. We also perform optical measurements of strain-driven Rabi precession of of the N-V V center spin ensemble, providing an additional quantitative measurement of the strain amplitude. As a result, we directly measure one of the six N-V V spin-stress coupling parameters, b = 2.73(2) MHz/GPa, by correlating these measurements at the same spatial position and applied microwave power. Our results demonstrate a unique technique for directly imaging ac lattice strain in micromechanical structures and provide a direct measurement of a fundamental constant for the N-V V center defect spin Hamiltonian.

TI Quantum-classical hybrid algorithm for the simulation of all-electron
   correlation
SO JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL PHYSICS
AB While chemical systems containing hundreds to thousands of electrons remain beyond the reach of quantum devices, hybrid quantum-classical algorithms present a promising pathway toward a quantum advantage. Hybrid algorithms treat the exponentially scaling part of the calculation-the static correlation-on the quantum computer and the non-exponentially scaling part-the dynamic correlation-on the classical computer. While a variety of algorithms have been proposed, the dependence of many methods on the total wave function limits the development of easy-to-use classical post-processing implementations. Here, we present a novel combination of quantum and classical algorithms, which computes the all-electron energy of a strongly correlated molecular system on the classical computer from the 2-electron reduced density matrix (2-RDM) evaluated on the quantum device. Significantly, we circumvent the wave function in the all-electron calculations by using density matrix methods that only require input of the statically correlated 2-RDM. Although the algorithm is completely general, we test it with two classical density matrix methods, the anti-Hermitian contracted Schrodinger equation (ACSE) and multiconfiguration pair-density functional theories, using the recently developed quantum ACSE method for simulating the statically correlated 2-RDM. We obtain experimental accuracy for the relative energies of all three benzyne isomers and thereby demonstrate the ability of the developed algorithm to achieve chemically relevant and accurate results on noisy intermediate-scale quantum devices.

TI Time derivatives of weak values
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB The time derivative of a physical property often gives rise to another meaningful property. Since weak values provide empirical insights that cannot be derived from expectation values, this paper explores what physical properties can be obtained from the time derivative of weak values. It demonstrates that, in general, the time derivative of a weak value that is invariant under an electromagnetic gauge transformation is neither a weak value nor a gauge-invariant quantity. Left- and right-hand time derivatives of a weak value are defined, and two necessary and sufficient conditions are presented to ensure that they are also gauge-invariant weak values. Finite-difference approximations of the left- and right-hand time derivatives of weak values are also presented, yielding results that match the theoretical expressions when these are gauge invariant. With these definitions, a local Ehrenfest-like theorem can be derived, giving a natural interpretation for the time derivative of weak values. Notably, a single measured weak value of the system's position provides information about two additional unmeasured weak values: the system's local velocity and acceleration, through the first- and second-order time derivatives of the initial weak value, respectively. These findings also offer guidelines for experimentalists to translate the weak value theory into practical laboratory setups, paving the way for innovative quantum technologies. An example illustrates how the electromagnetic field can be determined at specific positions and times from the first- and second-order time derivatives of a weak value of position.

TI A Hash-Based Quantum-Resistant Designated Verifier Signature Scheme
SO MATHEMATICS
AB Digital signatures are unsuitable for specific applications that are sensitive on a personal or commercial level because they are universally verifiable. Jakobsson et al. proposed the Designated Verifier Signature (DVS) system, which only allows the intended verifier to validate a message's signature. It prohibits the disclosure of a conviction to a third party. This functionality is useful in applications that require both authenticity and signer privacy, such as electronic voting and tender calls. The vast majority of current DVS schemes are based on difficult number theory problems such as integer factorization or discrete log problems over various groups. The development of a large-scale quantum computer would render these schemes unsafe. As a result, it is critical to develop quantum-resistant DVS methods. In both quantum and classical computers, signatures based on one-way functions are more efficient and secure. They have several advantages over digital signatures based on trapdoor functions. As a result, hash-based signatures are now considered viable alternatives to number-theoretic signatures. Existing hash-based signatures, on the other hand, are easily verifiable by anyone. As a result, they do not protect the signer's identity. In addition, they are one-time signatures. This paper presents a hash-based multi-time designated verifier signature scheme that ensures signer anonymity. The unforgeability of the signature scheme is also tested in the random oracle model under chosen message attack. The properties such as non-transferability and non-delegatability are investigated.

TI Robustness of multipartite entangled states in passive
   PT-symmetric qubits
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Non-Hermitian quantum systems have attracted significant interest in recent years due to the presence of unique spectral singularities in which eigenvalues and eigenvectors coalesce. Those singularities are known as exceptional points (EPs). The drastic changes of the non-Hermitian systems around their EPs have led to unique entanglement dynamics, which remained elusive until quite recently. In this work, we theoretically investigate the robustness of multipartite entanglement induced by EPs of the passive PT-symmetric non-Hermitian superconducting qubits, both in stand-alone configurations and hybrid setups with Hermitian qubits. In particular, we consider the qubits with both all-to-all and nearest-neighbor couplings under uniform and nonuniform coupling strengths. Our results reveal that non-Hermitian qubits with all-to-all coupling generate GHZ states, while those with nearest-neighbor interactions produce W states. These entangled states are resilient to nonuniform couplings, off-resonant driving fields, and decoherence effects. Moreover, the hybrid configurations combining Hermitian and non-Hermitian qubits indicate the necessity of EPs for rapidly generating and maintaining genuine multipartite entanglement. Additionally, driving the PT-symmetric qubits with a strong Rabi frequency can help sustain the entanglement over time by countering losses, while strong interqubit coupling favors the entangled states in the low dissipation regime. We also demonstrate that increasing the number of non-Hermitian qubits speeds up multipartite entanglement generation due to enhanced collective interactions. These findings reveal that exploiting non-Hermitian systems and their associated EPs is beneficial for generating robust and genuine entangled states which are useful for both fundamental studies and quantum technologies.

TI Programmable Activation of Quantum Emitters in High-Purity Silicon with
   Focused Carbon Ion Beams
SO ADVANCED QUANTUM TECHNOLOGIES
AB Carbon implantation at the nanoscale is highly desired for the engineering of defect-based qubits in a variety of materials, including silicon, diamond, silicon carbide (SiC) and hexagonal boron nitride (hBN). However, the lack of focused carbon ion beams does not allow for the full disclosure of their potential for application in quantum technologies. Here, a carbon source for focused ion beams is developed and utilized for the simultaneous creation of two types of quantum emitters in silicon, the W and G centers. Furthermore, a multi-step implantation protocol is applied for the programmable activation of the G centers with a spatial resolution better than 250 nm. This approach provides a route for significant enhancement of the creation yield of single G centers in carbon-free silicon wafers, including commercial silicon-on-insulator wafers. The experimental demonstration is an important step toward nanoscale engineering of telecom quantum emitters in silicon of high crystalline quality and isotope purity.

TI Bridging Performance Gaps: Exploring New Classes of Materials for Future
   Spintronics Technological Challenges
SO ADVANCED QUANTUM TECHNOLOGIES
AB Technological challenges, such as insufficient computation power, inefficient data storage, and unsafe communication, may not be tackled by currently utilized semiconductors or superconductors, which are still far from meeting the requirements of quantum-age applications. Spintronics, focused on electron transport phenomena dependent on spin, holds promise as an advanced technology. Nevertheless, most recent quantum technologies adopted by leading businesses and start-ups rely heavily on others, and there is a race to increase the number of qubits to gain a computational advantage. Therefore, it is crucial to consider new classes of materials instead of the conventional ones. Developing high-performance organic spintronics based on new classes of materials, namely, ionic liquids (ILs), liquid and soft crystals, and macroradicals, can support high-speed and low-power computing applications, offering higher spin-relaxation times in the order of microsecond at room temperature. This perspective discusses the key challenges of the currently utilized inorganic semiconductors, small molecules, and pi-conjugated polymers. It also discusses how the new classes of organic spintronics can bridge these performance gaps.
   Semiconductors and superconductors may not meet the increasing demand for safe yet efficient applications in this quantum age. High-performing organic spintronics utilizing ionic liquids (ILs), liquid and soft crystals, and open shell macroradicals can offer safer, faster, low-power computing and extended spin-relaxation times. This perspective delves into these challenges and explores the potential of this emerging spintronics class to resolve performance issuesimage.
