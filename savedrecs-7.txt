TI Comparing gate and annealing-based quantum computing for
   configuration-based design tasks
SO DESIGN SCIENCE
AB Complete exploration of design spaces is often computationally prohibitive. Classical search methods offer a solution but are limited by challenges like local optima and an inability to traverse dislocated design spaces. Quantum computing (QC) offers a potential solution by leveraging quantum phenomena to achieve computational speed-ups. However, the practical capability of current QC platforms to deliver these advantages remains unclear. To investigate this, we apply and compare two quantum approaches - the Gate-Based Grover's algorithm and quantum annealing (QA) - to a generic tile placement problem. We benchmark their performance on real quantum hardware (IBM and D-Wave, respectively) against a classical brute-force search. QA on D-Wave's hardware successfully produced usable results, significantly outperforming a classical brute-force approach (0.137 s vs 14.8 s) at the largest scale tested. Conversely, Grover's algorithm on IBM's gate-based hardware was dominated by noise and failed to yield solutions. While successful, the QA results exhibited a hardware-induced bias, where equally optimal solutions were not returned with the same probability (coefficient of variation: 0.248-0.463). These findings suggest that for near-term engineering applications, QA shows more immediate promise than current gate-based systems. This study's contribution is a direct comparison of two physically implemented quantum approaches, offering practical insights, reformulation examples and clear recommendations on the utilisation of QC in engineering design.

AB We present a first cross-validation of two open-source quantum network simulators, QuISP and SeQUeNCe, focusing on basic networking tasks to ensure consistency and accuracy in simulation outputs. Despite very similar design objectives of both simulators, their differing underlying assumptions can lead to variations in simulation results. We highlight the discrepancies in how the two simulators handle connections, internal network node processing time, and classical communication, resulting in significant differences in the time required to perform basic network tasks such as elementary link generation and entanglement swapping. We devise common ground scenarios to compare both the time to complete resource distribution and the fidelity of the distributed resources. Our findings indicate that while the simulators differ in the time required to complete network tasks-a constant factor difference attributable to their respective connection models-they agree on the fidelity of the distributed resources under identical error parameters. This work demonstrates a crucial first step towards enhancing the reliability and reproducibility of quantum network simulations, as well as leading to full protocol development. Furthermore, our benchmarking methodology establishes a foundational set of tasks for the cross-validation of simulators to study future quantum networks.

TI Optical multiqubit gate operations on an excitation-blockaded atomic
   quantum register
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB We consider a multiqubit system of atoms or ions with two computational ground states and an interacting excited state in the so-called blockade regime, such that only one qubit can be excited at any one time. Examples of such systems are rare-earth-ion-doped crystals and neutral atoms trapped in tweezer arrays. We present a simple laser excitation protocol that yields a complex phase factor on any desired multiqubit product state, and which can be used to implement multiqubit gates such as the n-bit Toffoli gates. The operation is performed using only two pulses, where each pulse simultaneously address all qubits involved in the operation. By relying on the well-established complex hyperbolic secant pulse shape, our scheme is also robust and permits complete transfers to and from the excited states despite variations in Rabi frequencies and transition frequencies. A detailed analysis of the multiqubit gate performance is provided.

TI Quantum entanglement of two bosonic modes in de Sitter space
SO EUROPEAN PHYSICAL JOURNAL PLUS
AB The time evolution of Gaussian quantum entanglement of two bosonic modes associated with a scalar quantum field in de Sitter space and in interaction with a thermal reservoir is investigated in the framework of the theory of open systems based on completely positive quantum dynamical semigroups. We show that quantum entanglement strongly depends on the squeezing of the bimodal state, the parameters characterizing the thermal environment, the curvature parameter of de Sitter space, and the mass parameter. The thermal environment and the curvature have a destructive influence on the entanglement, whose survival time depends on the competition between the contrary effects provided by the squeezing of the bimodal state, the curvature, and the thermal bath. The entanglement is minimized for values 1/2 and 3/2 of the mass parameter, corresponding to the conformally coupled scalar field, respectively, minimally coupled massless field.

TI Static and Dynamic Coherence Fraction in the Bernstein-Vazirani
   Algorithm
SO ADVANCED QUANTUM TECHNOLOGIES
AB Quantum entanglement and coherence are crucial resources in quantum information theory. In some scenarios, however, it is not necessary to directly estimate entanglement or coherence measures to quantify the capabilities of a state in quantum information processing. Instead, fully entangled fraction and coherence fraction are two alternatives for entanglement and coherence in specific quantum tasks. Here, a link is established between the coherence fraction and the Bernstein-Vazirani algorithm, which has several potential applications including cryptography and database search. It is showed that the success probability of the generalized Bernstein-Vazirani algorithm depends only on the coherence fraction of the initial state rather than its entanglement or coherence. Moreover, the coherence fraction dynamics are discussed and a relation is established between the operator's coherence fraction and the algorithm's success probability. These findings highlight how quantum coherence fraction influences the efficiency of quantum algorithms.

TI On applications of quantum computing to plasma simulations
SO PHYSICS OF PLASMAS
AB Quantum computing is gaining increased attention as a potential way to speed up simulations of physical systems, and it is also of interest to apply it to simulations of classical plasmas. However, quantum information science is traditionally aimed at modeling linear Hamiltonian systems of a particular form that is found in quantum mechanics, so extending the existing results to plasma applications remains a challenge. Here, we report a preliminary exploration of the long-term opportunities and likely obstacles in this area. First, we show that many plasma-wave problems are naturally representable in a quantumlike form and thus are naturally fit for quantum computers. Second, we consider more general plasma problems that include non-Hermitian dynamics (instabilities, irreversible dissipation) and nonlinearities. We show that by extending the configuration space, such systems can also be represented in a quantumlike form and thus can be simulated with quantum computers too, albeit that requires more computational resources compared to the first case. Third, we outline potential applications of hybrid quantum-classical computers, which include analysis of global eigenmodes and also an alternative approach to nonlinear simulations.

TI Advanced Shuttle Strategies for Parallel QCCD Architectures
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON QUANTUM ENGINEERING
AB Trapped ions (TIs) are at the forefront of quantum computing implementation, offering unparalleled coherence, fidelity, and connectivity. However, the scalability of TI systems is hampered by the limited capacity of individual ion traps, necessitating intricate ion shuttling for advanced computational tasks. The quantum charge-coupled device (QCCD) framework has emerged as a promising solution, facilitating ion mobility for universal quantum computation. Current QCCD architectures predominantly feature a linear topology, which is increasingly recognized as inefficient for complex quantum operations. Anticipating the shift toward more efficacious designs, this article introduces an innovative quantum scheduling strategy optimized for parallel QCCD topologies. Our strategy proposes a probabilistic formula for ion movement, alongside ingenious methods for local layer generation and layer compression, yielding a significant reduction in ion shuttle times. Through simulations, we demonstrate that our strategy not only substantially outstrips the linear model but also exhibits better performance over other parallel strategies that employ greedy algorithms. This is achieved through our nuanced resolution of complexities, such as traffic blocks and trap capacity limitations. The consequent reduction in shuttle operations leads to lower energy consumption and an enhancement in the quantum computer's fidelity, ultimately accelerating program execution times.

TI Computing graph edit distance on quantum devices
SO QUANTUM MACHINE INTELLIGENCE
AB Distance measures provide the foundation for many popular algorithms in Machine Learning and Pattern Recognition. Different notions of distance can be used depending on the types of the data the algorithm is working on. For graph-shaped data, an important notion is the Graph Edit Distance (GED) that measures the degree of (dis)similarity between two graphs in terms of the operations needed to make them identical. As the complexity of computing GED is the same as NP-hard problems, it is reasonable to consider approximate solutions. In this paper, we present a QUBO formulation of the GED problem. This allows us to implement two different approaches, namely quantum annealing and variational quantum algorithms, that run on the two types of quantum hardware currently available: quantum annealer and gate-based quantum computer, respectively. Considering the current state of noisy intermediate-scale quantum computers, we base our study on proof-of-principle tests of their performance.

TI Mitigating Errors on Superconducting Quantum Processors Through Fuzzy
   Clustering
SO ADVANCED QUANTUM TECHNOLOGIES
AB Quantum utility is severely limited in superconducting quantum hardware until now by the modest number of qubits and the relatively high level of control and readout errors, due to the intentional coupling with the external environment required for manipulation and readout of the qubit states. Practical applications in the Noisy Intermediate Scale Quantum (NISQ) era rely on Quantum Error Mitigation (QEM) techniques, which are able to improve the accuracy of the expectation values of quantum observables by implementing classical post-processing analysis from an ensemble of repeated noisy quantum circuit runs. In this work, a recent QEM technique that uses Fuzzy C-Means (FCM) clustering to specifically identify measurement error patterns is focused. For the first time, a proof-of-principle validation of the technique on a two-qubit register, obtained as a subset of a real NISQ five-qubit superconducting quantum processor based on transmon qubits is reported. It is demonstrated that the FCM-based QEM technique allows for reasonable improvement of the expectation values of single- and two-qubit gates-based quantum circuits, without necessarily invoking state-of-the-art coherence, gate, and readout fidelities.
   The performances of superconducting quantum hardware are still limited by the modest number of qubits and the high level of control/readout errors (NISQ era). Among measurement error mitigation techniques, a fuzzy clustering-based approach for identifying readout error patterns is emerging as a novel post-processing method for improving the hardware output. This methodology represents a valuable tool toward reliable quantum computation. image

TI Fast quantum state transfer and entanglement preparation in strongly
   coupled bosonic systems
SO NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB Continuous U(1) gauge symmetry, which guarantees the conservation of total excitations in linear bosonic systems, will be broken when it comes to the strong-coupling regime where the rotation wave approximation (RWA) fails. Here we develop analytic solutions for multi-mode bosonic systems with XX-type couplings beyond RWA, and propose a novel scheme to implement high-fidelity quantum state transfer (QST) and entanglement preparation (EP) with high speed. The scheme can be realized with designated coupling strength and pulse duration with which the excitation number keeps unchanged regardless of the breakdown of the global U(1) symmetry. In QST tasks, we consider several typical quantum states and demonstrate that this method is robust against thermal noise and imperfections of experimental sequence. In EP tasks, the scheme is successfully implemented for the preparation of Bell states and W-type states, within a shortest preparation time.

TI Dissipation-enabled resonant adiabatic quantum state transfer:
   Entanglement generation and quantum cloning
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Resonant dissipation-enabled adiabatic quantum state transfer processes between the polarization degrees of freedom of a single-photon wave packet and quantum emitters are discussed. These investigations generalize previous work [Trautmann and Alber, Phys. Rev. A 93, 053807 (2016)] by taking into account the properties of the spontaneously emitted photon wave packet and of nonadiabatic corrections. It is demonstrated that the photonic degrees of freedoms of these adiabatic one-photon quantum state transfer processes can be used for the passive, heralded, and deterministic preparation of Bell states of two material quantum emitters and for realizing a large family of symmetric and asymmetric quantum cloning processes. Although these theoretical investigations concentrate on waveguide scenarios they are expected to be relevant also for other scenarios as long as the processes involved are adiabatic so that the Fourier-limited bandwidth of the single-photon wave packet involved is small in comparison with the relevant dissipative rates.

TI Wireless and Fiber-Based Post-Quantum-Cryptography-Secured IPsec Tunnel
SO FUTURE INTERNET
AB In the near future, commercially accessible quantum computers are anticipated to revolutionize the world as we know it. These advanced machines are predicted to render traditional cryptographic security measures, deeply ingrained in contemporary communication, obsolete. While symmetric cryptography methods like AES can withstand quantum assaults if key sizes are doubled compared to current standards, asymmetric cryptographic techniques, such as RSA, are vulnerable to compromise. Consequently, there is a pressing need to transition towards post-quantum cryptography (PQC) principles in order to safeguard our privacy effectively. A challenge is to include PQC into existing protocols and thus into the existing communication structure. In this work, we report on the first experimental IPsec tunnel secured by the PQC algorithms Falcon, Dilithium, and Kyber. We deploy our IPsec tunnel in two scenarios. The first scenario represents a high-performance data center environment where many machines are interconnected via high-speed networks. We achieve an IPsec tunnel with an AES-256 GCM encrypted east-west throughput of 100 Gbit/s line rate. The second scenario shows an IPsec tunnel between a wireless NVIDIA Jetson and the cloud that achieves a 0.486 Gbit/s AES-256 GCM encrypted north-south throughput. This case represents a mobile device that communicates securely with applications running in the cloud.

TI Mind the gap: From resolving theoretical foundations of
   chiral(ity)-induced spin selectivity to pioneering implementations in
   quantum sensing
SO CHEMICAL PHYSICS REVIEWS
AB The chiral(ity)-induced spin selectivity (CISS) effect, where electrons passing through a chiral medium acquire significant spin polarization at ambient temperatures, has been widely observed experimentally, yet its theoretical foundations remain actively debated. Open questions persist regarding whether CISS originates from helical geometry or more general chirality and whether a unified mechanism can account for phenomena across solid-state and soft-matter systems, mesoscopic films, and single molecules. Clarifying the interrelations between existing models is essential to determine if a universal picture of CISS can be found or whether system-specific models are required, and if so, where their common starting point should lie for a workable classification of CISS manifestations. Despite this theoretical fragmentation, recent studies of CISS effects in electron-transfer systems, magnetic field sensitivity and coherence of radical pair reactions, polarized electroluminescence in chiral hybrid perovskites, DNA-based biosensors, and enantioselective detection highlight its broad conceptual relevance and potential applications in spintronics, molecular sensors, and quantum information processing. In this review, we help bridge the gap between theory, experiment, and implementation, with a particular focus on prospects for quantum sensing and metrology. We outline fundamental frameworks of CISS, clarifying what constitutes the "chiral," the "induced," and the "spin selectivity" that make up CISS, before going on to survey key model realizations and their assumptions. We examine some of the emerging quantum sensing applications and assess the model-specific implications, in particular exemplifying these in the context of spin-correlated radical pairs, which offer a promising, tunable, and biomimetic platform for emerging molecular quantum technologies.

TI Network Coding-Based Post-Quantum Cryptography
SO IEEE JOURNAL ON SELECTED AREAS IN INFORMATION THEORY
AB We propose a novel hybrid universal network-coding cryptosystem (HUNCC) to obtain secure post-quantum cryptography at high communication rates. The secure network-coding scheme we offer is hybrid in the sense that it combines information-theoretic security with public-key cryptography. In addition, the scheme is general and can be applied to any communication network, and to any public-key cryptosystem. Our hybrid scheme is based on the information theoretic notion of individual secrecy, which traditionally relies on the assumption that an eavesdropper can only observe a subset of the communication links between the trusted parties - an assumption that is often challenging to enforce. For this setting, several code constructions have been developed, where the messages are linearly mixed before transmission over each of the paths in a way that guarantees that an adversary which observes only a subset has sufficient uncertainty about each individual message. Instead, in this article, we take a computational viewpoint, and construct a coding scheme in which an arbitrary secure cryptosystem is utilized on a subset of the links, while a pre-processing similar to the one in individual security is utilized. Under this scheme, we demonstrate 1) a computational security guarantee for an adversary which observes the entirety of the links 2) an information theoretic security guarantee for an adversary which observes a subset of the links, and 3) information rates which approach the capacity of the network and greatly improve upon the current solutions. A perhaps surprising consequence of our scheme is that, to guarantee a computational security level b, it is sufficient to encrypt a single link using a computational post-quantum scheme. That is, using HUNCC, we can ensure post-quantum security in networks where it is not possible to use public-key encryption over all the links in the network. In addition, the information rate approaches 1 as the number of communication links increases. As a concrete example, in a multipath network with three links, using a 128-bit computationally secure McEliece cryptosystem only over one link, we obtain a 128-bit individually computationally secure level over all paths with a total information rate of 0.91 in the network.

AB We present a broad investigation of asymptotic binary hypothesis testing, when each hypothesis represents asymptotically many independent instances of a quantum channel, and the tests are based on using the unknown channel multiple times and observing its output at the end. Unlike the familiar setting of quantum states as hypotheses, there is a fundamental distinction between adaptive and non-adaptive strategies with respect to the channel uses, and we introduce a number of further variants of the discrimination tasks by imposing different restrictions on the test strategies. Our main result is the first separation between adaptive and non-adaptive symmetric hypothesis testing exponents for quantum channels, which we derive from a general lower bound on the error probability for non-adaptive strategies; the concrete example we analyze is a pair of entanglement-breaking channels. Full details in [1].

TI Quantum Circuit Discovery for Fault-Tolerant Logical State Preparation
   with Reinforcement Learning
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW X
AB The realization of large-scale quantum computers requires not only quantum error correction but also fault-tolerant (FT) operations to handle errors that propagate into harmful errors. Recently, flag-based protocols have been introduced that use ancillary qubits to flag harmful errors. However, there is no clear recipe for finding a FT quantum circuit with flag-based protocols, especially when we consider hardware constraints, such as the qubit connectivity and available gate set. This work presents a novel approach to automatically discover compact and hardware-adapted FT quantum circuits to make significant progress towards scalable FT quantum computing. We employ reinforcement learning (RL) as an enabling tool, leveraging a fast, parallelized stabilizer quantum circuit simulator and a nontrivial reward function specifically adapted to the problem. We show that, in the task of FT logical state preparation, RL discovers not only circuits with fewer gates and ancillary qubits than published results but also novel circuits without and with hardware constraints of up to distance-5 codes with 25 physical qubits, and they can be implemented directly in experiments. Furthermore, RL allows for straightforward exploration of different qubit connectivities and the use of transfer learning to accelerate the discovery. More generally, our work sets the framework towards the use of RL or other machine learning techniques for FT quantum circuit discovery with hardware constraints to make real progress towards the realization of large-scale quantum computers, addressing tasks beyond state preparation, including magic state preparation, logical gate synthesis, and syndrome measurement.

TI Solving quantum statistical mechanics with variational autoregressive
   networks and quantum circuits
SO MACHINE LEARNING-SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB We extend the ability of an unitary quantum circuit by interfacing it with a classical autoregressive neural network. The combined model parametrizes a variational density matrix as a classical mixture of quantum pure states, where the autoregressive network generates bitstring samples as input states to the quantum circuit. We devise an efficient variational algorithm to jointly optimize the classical neural network and the quantum circuit to solve quantum statistical mechanics problems. One can obtain thermal observables such as the variational free energy, entropy, and specific heat. As a byproduct, the algorithm also gives access to low energy excitation states. We demonstrate applications of the approach to thermal properties and excitation spectra of the quantum Ising model with resources that are feasible on near-term quantum computers.

SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB We determine the mass gap of a two-dimensional O(3) nonlinear sigma model augmented with a topological 0-term using tensor network and digital quantum algorithms. As proof of principle, we consider the example 0 = n and study its critical behavior on a quantum simulator by examining the entanglement entropy of the ground state. We confirm that the quantum theory is massless in the strong-coupling regime, in agreement with analytical results. However, we also highlight the limitations of current quantum algorithms, designed for noisy intermediate-scale quantum devices, in the theory simulation at weak coupling. Finally, we compare the performance of our quantum algorithms to classical tensor network methods.

TI A Generalised Transform Methodology Using Quantum Computation and Its
   Application for Electrocardiogram (ECG) Classification
SO IET QUANTUM COMMUNICATION
AB Transforms play a pivotal role in the study of signals and images. With the advent of quantum systems, analysing signals in the quantum domain is of particular interest. In this work, we aim to build a generalised transform circuit in the quantum domain. We have shown the working of this circuit for Wavelet transform, Fourier transform, and Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) on 1-D vector, 2-D matrix, and an image respectively. We also take inverse transforms in each of the cases to match with the given initial input. We use simulators for this work, and the results obtained are favourable. We further use this circuit for classification of heart beats as it is an essential task in detection of cardiac diseases. We utilise both classical and quantum computation to classify beats of Electrocardiogram (ECG, hereafter) signals into normal and not-normal beats (non-beats and abnormal beats). This novel architecture to carry out transform is quite general and can be used for any arbitrary transform.

TI Quantum Mixture-Density Network for Multimodal Probabilistic Prediction
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB Multimodal probability distributions are common in both quantum and classical systems, yet modeling them remains challenging when the number of modes is large or unknown. Classical methods such as mixture-density networks (MDNs) scale poorly, requiring parameter counts that grow quadratically with the number of modes. We introduce a Quantum Mixture-Density Network (Q-MDN) that employs parameterized quantum circuits to efficiently model multimodal distributions. By representing an exponential number of modes with a compact set of qubits and parameters, Q-MDN predicts Gaussian mixture components with high resolution. We evaluate Q-MDN on two benchmark tasks: the quantum double-slit experiment and chaotic logistic bifurcation. In both cases, Q-MDN outperforms classical MDNs in mode separability and prediction sharpness under equal parameter budgets. Our results demonstrate an efficiency in probabilistic regression and highlight the potential of quantum machine learning in capturing complex stochastic behavior.

TI Calibration of Flux Crosstalk in Large-Scale Flux-Tunable
   Superconducting Quantum Circuits
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB Magnetic flux tunability is an essential feature in most approaches to quantum computing based on superconducting qubits. Independent control of the fluxes in multiple loops is hampered by crosstalk. Calibrating flux crosstalk becomes a challenging task when the circuit elements interact strongly. We present a novel approach to flux crosstalk calibration, which is circuit model independent and relies on an iterative process to gradually improve calibration accuracy. This method allows us to reduce errors due to the inductive coupling between loops. The calibration procedure is automated and implemented on devices consisting of tunable flux qubits and couplers with up to 27 control loops. We devise a method to characterize the calibration error, which is used to show that the errors of the measured crosstalk coefficients are all below 0.17%.

TI Hybrid Quantum-Classical Neural Networks for Efficient MNIST Binary
   Image Classification
SO MATHEMATICS
AB Image classification is a fundamental task in deep learning, and recent advances in quantum computing have generated significant interest in quantum neural networks. Traditionally, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are employed to extract image features, while Multilayer Perceptrons (MLPs) handle decision making. However, parameterized quantum circuits offer the potential to capture complex image features and define sophisticated decision boundaries. In this paper, we present a novel Hybrid Quantum-Classical Neural Network (H-QNN) for image classification, and demonstrate its effectiveness using the MNIST dataset. Our model combines quantum computing with classical supervised learning to enhance classification accuracy and computational efficiency. In this study, we detail the architecture of the H-QNN, emphasizing its capability in feature learning and image classification. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed H-QNN model outperforms conventional deep learning methods in various training scenarios, showcasing its effectiveness in high-dimensional image classification tasks. Additionally, we explore the broader applicability of hybrid quantum-classical approaches in other domains. Our findings contribute to the growing body of work in quantum machine learning, and underscore the potential of quantum-enhanced models for image recognition and classification.

TI Fault-tolerant quantum computing with the parity code and biased-noise
   qubits
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW APPLIED
AB We present a fault-tolerant universal quantum computing architecture based on a code concatenation of biased-noise qubits and the parity architecture. The parity architecture can be understood as a low-density parity-check code tailored specifically to obtain any desired logical connectivity from nearest-neighbor physical interactions. The code layout can be dynamically adjusted to algorithmic requirements on the fly. This allows for implementations with any desired code distance with a universal set of fault-tolerant gates. In addition to the previously explored toolsets for concatenated cat codes, our approach features parallelizable interactions between arbitrary sets of qubits by directly addressing the parity qubits in the code. The proposed scheme supports codes with lower physical qubit overhead than the repetition code at the same code distances, while requiring only weight-3 and weight-4 stabilizers and nearest-neighbor connectivity on a two-dimensional square lattice.

TI QHF-CS: Quantum-Enhanced Heart Failure Prediction Using Quantum CNN with
   Optimized Feature Qubit Selection with Cuckoo Search in Skewed Clinical
   Data
SO CMC-COMPUTERS MATERIALS & CONTINUA
AB Heart failure prediction is crucial as cardiovascular diseases become the leading cause of death worldwide, exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic. Age, cholesterol, and blood pressure datasets are becoming inadequate because they cannot capture the complexity of emerging health indicators. These high-dimensional and heterogeneous datasets make traditional machine learning methods difficult, and Skewness and other new biomarkers and psychosocial factors bias the model's heart health prediction across diverse patient profiles. Modern medical datasets' complexity and high dimensionality challenge traditional prediction models like Support Vector Machines and Decision Trees. Quantum approaches include QSVM, QkNN, QDT, and others. These Constraints drove research. The "QHF-CS: Quantum-Enhanced Heart Failure Prediction using Quantum CNN with Optimized Feature Qubit Selection with Cuckoo Search in Skewed Clinical Data" system was developed in this research. This novel system leverages a Quantum Convolutional Neural Network (QCNN)-based quantum circuit, enhanced by meta-heuristic algorithms- Cuckoo Search Optimization (CSO), Artificial Bee Colony (ABC), and Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO)-for feature qubit selection. Among these, CSO demonstrated superior performance by consistently identifying the most optimal and least skewed feature subsets, which were then encoded into quantum states for circuit construction. By integrating advanced quantum circuit feature maps like ZZFeatureMap, RealAmplitudes, and EfficientSU2, the QHF-CS model efficiently processes complex, high-dimensional data, capturing intricate patterns that classical models overlook. The QHF-CS model improves precision, recall, F1-score, and accuracy to 0.94, 0.95, 0.94, and 0.94. Quantum computing could revolutionize heart failure diagnostics by improving model accuracy and computational efficiency, enabling complex healthcare diagnostic breakthroughs.

TI Plant quantum biology: The quantum dimension of plant responses to
   stress
SO PLANT STRESS
AB The intricate interplay of quantum coherence, entanglement, radical pair mechanisms, and tunneling, suggests that plants operate at a level of sophistication beyond classical expectations. The potential to harness these quantum principles for agricultural innovation and environmental sustainability is immense. This review provides a comprehensive overview of plant quantum biology, extending beyond photosynthesis and magnetosensitivity the exploration of enzyme catalysis and stress responses. The quantum coherence and entanglement in photosynthetic light harvesting and energy transfer, examining their role in efficient energy transduction is evaluated. Plant magnetosensitivity, mediated by cryptochromes and iron-sulfur clusters, is discussed as a potential quantum sensing mechanism. The radical pair mechanism influence on plant growth, development, and circadian rhythms via magnetic field perception is analyzed. Quantum tunnelling impact on enzyme reaction rates and substrate specificity is also discussed. The critical intersection of quantum biology and plant stress responses, encompassing light, oxidative stress, temperature, and biotic stress, is examined. How quantum effects might modulate these responses, offering opportunities for developing stress-tolerant crops reveal that challenges posed by biological complexity, transient quantum phenomena, and experimental limitations, along the need for robust theoretical models are future trends in plant stress biology. Future research should focus on manipulating quantum effects in vivo, bridging fundamental science and agricultural applications for enhanced sustainability.

TI Enhancing the quantum entanglement and EPR steering of a coupled
   optomechanical system with a squeezed vacuum field
SO JOURNAL OF THE OPTICAL SOCIETY OF AMERICA B-OPTICAL PHYSICS
AB Quantum entanglement and Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR) steering are valuable resources in quantum informa-tion processing. How to enhance the quantum entanglement and EPR steering of coupled optomechanical systems with a weak squeezed vacuum field is studied when the displacement of detuning induced by the mechanical mode is considered. Compared with the condition that the system interacts with a vacuum environment, the quantum entanglement and EPR steering are stronger when the squeezed vacuum field is applied. A squeezed vacuum field with a large degree is not beneficial to enhance the quantum entanglement and EPR steering. Rather than the squeezing parameter of the squeezed vacuum field, the reference phase plays a vital role in this model. (c) 2023 Optica Publishing Group

AB Many quantum computers have constraints regarding which two-qubit operations are locally allowed. To run a quantum circuit under those constraints, qubits need to be mapped to different quantum registers, and multi-qubit gates need to be routed accordingly. Recent developments have shown that compiling strategies based on Steiner tree provide a competitive tool to route CNOTs. However, these algorithms require the qubit map to be decided before routing. Moreover, the qubit map is fixed throughout the computation, i.e. the logical qubit will not be moved to a different physical qubit register. This is inefficient with respect to the CNOT count of the resulting circuit.In this paper, we propose the algorithm PermRowCol for routing CNOTs in a quantum circuit. It dynamically remaps logical qubits during the computation, and thus results in fewer output CNOTs than the algorithms Steiner-Gauss [14] and RowCol [27].Here we focus on circuits over CNOT only, but this method could be generalized to a routing and mapping strategy on Clifford+T circuits by slicing the quantum circuit into subcircuits composed of CNOTs and single-qubit gates. Additionally, PermRowCol can be used in place of Steiner-Gauss in the synthesis of phase polynomials as well as the extraction of quantum circuits from ZX-diagrams.

TI Nonviolation of the CHSH inequality under local spin-1 measurements on
   two spin qutrits
SO PHYSICA SCRIPTA
AB In the present paper, based on the general analytical expression [arXiv:2412.03470] for the maximum of the CHSH expectation under local Alice and Bob spin-s measurements in a two-qudit state of dimension d = 2s + 1, s >= 1/2, we analyze whether or not, under spin-1 measurements in an arbitrary two-qutrit state, the CHSH inequality is violated. We find analytically for a variety of pure nonseparable two-qutrit states and also, numerically for 1, 000, 000 randomly generated pure nonseparable two-qutrit states, that, under local Alice and Bob spin-1 measurements in each of these nonseparable states, including maximally entangled, the CHSH inequality is not violated. These results together with the spectral decomposition of a mixed state lead us to the Conjecture that, under local Alice and Bob spin-1 measurements, every nonseparable two-qutrit state, pure or mixed, does not violate the CHSH inequality. For a variety of pure two-qutrit states, we further find the values of their concurrence and compare them with the values of their spin-1 CHSH parameter, which determines violation or nonviolation by a two-qutrit state of the CHSH inequality under spin-1 measurements. This comparison indicates that, in contrast to spin-1/2 measurements, where the spin-1/2 CHSH parameter of a pure two-qubit state is increasing monotonically with a growth of its entanglement, for a pure two-qutrit state, this is not the case. In particular, for the two-qutrit GHZ state, which is maximally entangled, the spin-1 CHSH parameter is equal to root 8/9, while, for some separable pure two-qutrit states, this parameter can be equal to unity. Moreover, for the two-qutrit Horodecki state, the spin-1 CHSH parameter is equal to 4 root 2/21 < 1 regardless of the entanglement type of this mixed state.

TI Decoherence of Single-Excitation Entanglement over
   Duan-Lukin-Cirac-Zoller Quantum Networks Caused by Slow-Magnetic-Field
   Fluctuations and Protection Approach
SO ADVANCED QUANTUM TECHNOLOGIES
AB Atomic spin-wave (SW) memory is a building block for quantum repeater. However, due to decoherence caused by atomic motions and magnetic-field gradients, SW retrieval efficiency decays with storage time. Slow magnetic-field fluctuations (SMFFs) lead to shot-to-shot phase noises of SWs, but have not been considered in previous repeater protocols. Here, a SW model including a homogeneous phase noise caused by SMFFs is developed, and then revealed that such phase noise induces decoherence of single-excitation entanglement between two atomic ensembles in a repeater link. For verifying this conclusion, single-excitation entanglement between two SWs in a cold atomic ensemble is experimentally prepared and observed entanglement decoherence induced by SMFFs. Limited by SMFFs, the evaluated lifetime of the single-excitation entanglement over a repeater link is & AP;135 ms, even if the link uses optical-lattice atoms as nodes. Then an approach that may overcome such limitations and extend this lifetime to & AP;1.7 s is presented.

TI Optimal State Transfer and Entanglement Generation in Power-Law
   Interacting Systems
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW X
AB We present an optimal protocol for encoding an unknown qubit state into a multiqubit Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger-like state and, consequently, transferring quantum information in large systems exhibiting power-law (1/r(alpha)) interactions. For all power-law exponents alpha between d and 2d + 1, where d is the dimension of the system, the protocol yields a polynomial speed-up for alpha > 2d and a superpolynomial speed-up for alpha <= 2d, compared to the state of the art. For all alpha > d, the protocol saturates the Lieb-Robinson bounds (up to subpolynomial corrections), thereby establishing the optimality of the protocol and the tightness of the bounds in this regime. The protocol has a wide range of applications, including in quantum sensing, quantum computing, and preparation of topologically ordered states. In addition, the protocol provides a lower bound on the gate count in digital simulations of power-law interacting systems.

TI Cryogenic flip-chip interconnection for silicon qubit devices
SO JAPANESE JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYSICS
AB Interfacing qubits with peripheral control circuitry poses one of the major common challenges toward realization of large-scale quantum computation. Spin qubits in silicon quantum dots (QDs)are particularly promising for scaling up, owing to the potential benefits from the know-how of the semiconductor industry. In this paper, we focus on the interposer technique as one of the potential solutions for the quantum-classical interface problem and report DC and RF characterization of a silicon QD device mounted on an interposer. We demonstrate flip-chip interconnection with the qubit device down to 4.2 K by observing Coulomb diamonds. We furthermore propose and demonstrate a laser-cut technique to disconnect peripheral circuits no longer in need. These results may pave the way toward system-on-a-chip quantum-classical integration for future quantum processors.

TI A Characterization of Entangled Two-Qubit States via
   Partial-Transpose-Moments
SO ANNALEN DER PHYSIK
AB Although quantum entanglement is an important resource, its characterization is quite challenging. The partial transposition is a common method to detect bipartite entanglement. In this paper, the authors study the partial-transpose(PT)-moments of two-qubit states, and completely describe the whole region, composed of the second and third PT-moments, for all two-qubit states. Furthermore, they determine the accurate region corresponding to all entangled two-qubit states. The states corresponding to those boundary points of the whole region, and to the border lines between separable and entangled states are analyzed. As an application, they characterize the entangled region of PT-moments for the two families of Werner states and Bell-diagonal states. The relations between entanglement and the pairs of PT-moments are revealed from these typical examples. They also numerically plot the whole region of possible PT-moments for all two-qubit X-states, and find that this region is almost the same as the whole region of PT-moments for all two-qubit states. Moreover, they extend their results to detect the entanglement of multiqubit states. By utilizing the PT-moment-based method to characterize the entanglement of the multiqubit states mixed by the GHZ and W states, they propose an operational way of verifying the genuine entanglement in such states.

TI Enhancing Quantum Key Distribution Security Through Hybrid Protocol
   Integration
SO SYMMETRY-BASEL
AB With the increasing complexity of cyber threats and the emergence of quantum computing, enhancing secure communication is essential. This study explores an effective hybrid quantum key distribution (QKD) protocol that integrates photonic and atomic systems to leverage their respective strengths. The concept of symmetry plays a crucial role in this context, as it underpins the principles of entanglement and the balance between key generation and error correction. The photonic system is used for the initial key generation, while the atomic system facilitates entanglement swapping, error correction, and privacy amplification. The comprehensive theoretical framework encompasses key components, detailed security proofs, performance metrics, and an analysis of system vulnerabilities, illustrating the resilience of the hybrid protocol against potential threats. Extensive experimental studies demonstrate that the hybrid QKD protocol seamlessly integrates photonic and atomic systems, enabling secure key distribution with minimal errors and loss rates over long distances. This combination of the two systems reveals exceptional resilience against eavesdropping, significantly improving both security and robustness compared with traditional QKD protocols. Consequently, this makes it a compelling solution for secure communication in the increasingly digital world.

TI Single electrons on solid neon as a solid-state qubit platform
SO NATURE
AB yProgress towards the realization of quantum computers requires persistent advances in their constituent building blocks-qubits. Novel qubit platforms that simultaneously embody long coherence, fast operation and large scalability offer compelling advantages in the construction of quantum computers and many other quantum information systems(1-3). Electrons, ubiquitous elementary particles of non-zero charge, spin and mass, have commonly been perceived as paradigmatic local quantum information carriers. Despite superior controllability and configurability, their practical performance as qubits through either motional or spin states depends critically on their material environment(3-5). Here we report our experimental realization of a qubit platform based on isolated single electrons trapped on an ultraclean solid neon surface in vacuum(6-13). By integrating an electron trap in a circuit quantum electrodynamics architecture(14-20), we achieve strong coupling between the motional states of a single electron and a single microwave photon in an on-chip superconducting resonator. Qubit gate operations and dispersive readout are implemented to measure the energy relaxation time T-1 of 15 mu s and phase coherence time T-2 over 200 ns. These results indicate that the electron-on-solid-neon qubit already performs near the state of the art for a charge qubit(21).

TI Simulation of a two-qubit quantum gate based on classical transverse
   spatial waveguide mode encoding
SO OPTICS CONTINUUM
AB We demonstrate the simulation of a classical transverse mode-encoded controlled- NOT (CNOT) gate. Note that this integrated CNOT logic gate is composed of two 1/2 spatial mode beamsplitters and three 1/3 spatial mode beamsplitters, following the scheme proposed by Ralph. We will show how the CNOT gate can be analogously implemented by photonic integrated circuits in the classical regime, focusing on exploring the violation of Bell's inequality by mode-entangled states. Our work may provide a promising approach to implementing small-scale quantum simulation and has the potential to enable practical and robust optical quantum information processing.

TI What the foundations of quantum computer science teach us about
   chemistry
SO JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL PHYSICS
AB With the rapid development of quantum technology, one of the leading applications that has been identified is the simulation of chemistry. Interestingly, even before full scale quantum computers are available, quantum computer science has exhibited a remarkable string of results that directly impact what is possible in a chemical simulation with any computer. Some of these results even impact our understanding of chemistry in the real world. In this Perspective, we take the position that direct chemical simulation is best understood as a digital experiment. While on the one hand, this clarifies the power of quantum computers to extend our reach, it also shows us the limitations of taking such an approach too directly. Leveraging results that quantum computers cannot outpace the physical world, we build to the controversial stance that some chemical problems are best viewed as problems for which no algorithm can deliver their solution, in general, known in computer science as undecidable problems. This has implications for the predictive power of thermodynamic models and topics such as the ergodic hypothesis. However, we argue that this Perspective is not defeatist but rather helps shed light on the success of existing chemical models such as transition state theory, molecular orbital theory, and thermodynamics as models that benefit from data. We contextualize recent results, showing that data-augmented models are a more powerful rote simulation. These results help us appreciate the success of traditional chemical theory and anticipate new models learned from experimental data. Not only can quantum computers provide data for such models, but they can also extend the class and power of models that utilize data in fundamental ways. These discussions culminate in speculation on new ways for quantum computing and chemistry to interact and our perspective on the eventual roles of quantum computers in the future of chemistry.</p>

TI On the VCO/Frequency Divider Interface in Cryogenic CMOS PLL for Quantum
   Computing Applications
SO ELECTRONICS
AB The availability of quantum microprocessors is mandatory, to efficiently run those quantum algorithms promising a radical leap forward in computation capability. Silicon-based nanostructured qubits appear today as a very interesting approach, because of their higher information density, longer coherence times, fast operation gates, and compatibility with the actual CMOS technology. In particular, thanks to their phase noise properties, the actual CMOS RFIC Phase-Locked Loops (PLL) and Phase-Locked Oscillators (PLO) are interesting circuits to synthesize control signals for spintronic qubits. In a quantum microprocessor, these circuits should operate close to the qubits, that is, at cryogenic temperatures. The lack of commercial cryogenic Design Kits (DK) may make the interface between the Voltage Controlled Oscillator (VCO) and the Frequency Divider (FD) a serious issue. Nevertheless, currently this issue has not been systematically addressed in the literature. The aim of the present paper is to investigate the VCO/FD interface when the temperature drops from room to cryogenic. To this purpose, physical models of electronics passive/active devices and equivalent circuits of VCO and the FD were developed at room and cryogenic temperatures. The modeling activity has led to design guidelines for the VCO/FD interface, useful in the absence of cryogenic DKs.

TI Ion-Based Characterization of Laser Beam Profiles for Quantum
   Information Processing
SO ENTROPY
AB Laser-driven operations are a common approach for engineering one- and two-qubit gates in trapped-ion arrays. Measuring key parameters of these lasers, such as beam sizes, intensities, and polarizations, is central to predicting and optimizing gate speeds and stability. Unfortunately, it is challenging to accurately measure these properties at the ion location within an ultra-high vacuum chamber. Here, we demonstrate how the ions themselves may be used as sensors to directly characterize the laser beams needed for quantum gate operations. Making use of the four-photon Stark Shift effect in 171Yb+ ions, we measure the profiles, alignments, and polarizations of the lasers driving counter-propagating Raman transitions. We then show that optimizing the parameters of each laser individually leads to higher-speed Raman-driven gates with smaller susceptibility to errors. Our approach demonstrates the capability of trapped ions to probe their local environments and to provide useful feedback for improving system performance.

TI Digital Quantum Simulation of the Spin-Boson Model under Markovian
   Open-System Dynamics
SO ENTROPY
AB Digital quantum computers have the potential to simulate complex quantum systems. The spin-boson model is one of such systems, used in disparate physical domains. Importantly, in a number of setups, the spin-boson model is open, i.e., the system is in contact with an external environment which can, for instance, cause the decay of the spin state. Here, we study how to simulate such open quantum dynamics in a digital quantum computer, for which we use an IBM hardware. We consider in particular how accurate different implementations of the evolution result as a function of the level of noise in the hardware and of the parameters of the open dynamics. For the regimes studied, we show that the key aspect is to simulate the unitary portion of the dynamics, while the dissipative part can lead to a more noise-resistant simulation. We consider both a single spin coupled to a harmonic oscillator, and also two spins coupled to the oscillator. In the latter case, we show that it is possible to simulate the emergence of correlations between the spins via the oscillator.

TI Asymmetric Measurement-Device-Independent Quantum Key Distribution
   through Advantage Distillation
SO ENTROPY
AB Measurement-device-independent quantum key distribution (MDI-QKD) completely closes the security loopholes caused by the imperfection of devices at the detection terminal. Commonly, a symmetric MDI-QKD model is widely used in simulations and experiments. This scenario is far from a real quantum network, where the losses of channels connecting each user are quite different. To adapt such a feature, an asymmetric MDI-QKD model is proposed. How to improve the performance of asymmetric MDI-QKD also becomes an important research direction. In this work, an advantage distillation (AD) method is applied to further improve the performance of asymmetric MDI-QKD without changing the original system structure. Simulation results show that the AD method can improve the secret key rate and transmission distance, especially in the highly asymmetric cases. Therefore, this scheme will greatly promote the development of future MDI-QKD networks.

TI Quantum Computing Meets Deep Learning: A Promising Approach for Diabetic
   Retinopathy Classification
SO MATHEMATICS
AB Diabetic retinopathy seems to be the cause of micro-vascular retinal alterations. It remains a leading reason for blindness and vision loss in adults around the age of 20 to 74. Screening for this disease has become vital in identifying referable cases that require complete ophthalmic evaluation and treatment to avoid permanent loss of vision. The computer-aided design could ease this screening process, which requires limited time, and assist clinicians. The main complexity in classifying images involves huge computation, leading to slow classification. Certain image classification approaches integrating quantum computing have recently evolved to resolve this. With its parallel computing ability, quantum computing could assist in effective classification. The notion of integrating quantum computing with conventional image classification methods is theoretically feasible and advantageous. However, as existing image classification techniques have failed to procure high accuracy in classification, a robust approach is needed. The present research proposes a quantum-based deep convolutional neural network to avert these pitfalls and identify disease grades from the Indian Diabetic Retinopathy Image Dataset. Typically, quantum computing could make use of the maximum number of entangled qubits for image reconstruction without any additional information. This study involves conceptual enhancement by proposing an optimized structural system termed an optimized multiple-qbit gate quantum neural network for the classification of DR. In this case, multiple qubits are regarded as the ability of qubits in multiple states to exist concurrently, which permits performance improvement with the distinct additional qubit. The overall performance of this system is validated in accordance with performance metrics, and the proposed method achieves 100% accuracy, 100% precision, 100% recall, 100% specificity, and 100% f1-score.

AB We present qcor-a language extension to C++ and compiler implementation that enables heterogeneous quantum-classical programming, compilation, and execution in a single-source context. Our work provides a first-of-its-kind C++ compiler enabling high-level quantum kernel (function) expression in a quantum-language agnostic manner, as well as a hardware-agnostic, retargetable compiler workflow targeting a number of physical and virtual quantum computing backends. qcor leverages novel Clang plugin interfaces and builds upon the XACC system-level quantum programming framework to provide a state-of-the-art integration mechanism for quantum-classical compilation that leverages the best from the community at-large. qcor translates quantum kernels ultimately to the XACC intermediate representation, and provides user-extensible hooks for quantum compilation routines like circuit optimization, analysis, and placement.

TI Purifying quantum-dot light in a coherent frequency interface
SO QUANTUM SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB Quantum networks typically operate in the telecom wavelengths to take advantage of low-loss transmission in optical fibres. However, bright quantum dots (QDs) emitting highly indistinguishable quantum states of light, such as InGaAs QDs, often emit photons in the near infrared thus necessitating frequency conversion (FC) to the telecom band. Furthermore, the signal quality of quantum emissions is crucial for the effective performance of these networks. In this work we report a method for simultaneously implementing spectral purification and frequency shifting of single photons from QD sources to the c-band in a periodically poled lithium niobate waveguide. We consider difference frequency generation in the counter-propagating configuration to implement FC with the output emission bandwidth in units of GHz. Our approach establishes a clear path to integrating high-performance single-emitter sources in a hybrid quantum network.

TI Nonassociative Geometric and Quantum Information Flows and R-Flux
   Deformations of Wormhole Solutions in String Gravity
SO FORTSCHRITTE DER PHYSIK-PROGRESS OF PHYSICS
AB This article consists of an introduction to the theory of nonassociative geometric classical and quantum information flows defined by star products with R-flux deformations in string gravity. Corresponding nonassociative generalizations of the concepts of classical Shannon entropy, quantum von Neumann entropy, Renyi entropy are formulated. The fundamental geometric and quantum information objects are computed following the Grigori Perelman statistical thermodynamic approach to Ricci flows and gravity theories generalized for phase spaces modeled as (co) tangent Lorentz bundles. Nonassociative parametric deformations and nonholonomic thermo-geometric versions of statistical generating functions, their quantum analogues as density matrices are considered for deriving the entropy, energy and fluctuation functionals. This allows us to define and compute respective classical and quantum relative and conditional entropies, mutual information and nonassociative entanglement and thermodynamic information variables. The principles of nonassociative quantum geometric and information flow theory, QGIF, and study the basic properties of such quasi-stationary models related to modified gravity theories are formulated. Applications are considered for nonassociative deformed and entangled couples of four-dimensional (4-d), wormholes (defined by respective spacetime and/or momentum type coordinates) and nonassociative QGIFs of 8-d phase space generalized wormholes configurations. Finally, phase space black holes and wormholes being transversable for nonassociative qubits, quantum channels and entanglement witness are speculated; thought and laboratory experiments are discussed; and perspectives for quantum computer modeling and tests of nonassociative geometric flow and gravity theories are considered.

TI Best practices for portfolio optimization by quantum computing,
   experimented on real quantum devices
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB In finance, portfolio optimization aims at finding optimal investments maximizing a trade-off between return and risks, given some constraints. Classical formulations of this quadratic optimization problem have exact or heuristic solutions, but the complexity scales up as the market dimension increases. Recently, researchers are evaluating the possibility of facing the complexity scaling issue by employing quantum computing. In this paper, the problem is solved using the Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE), which in principle is very efficient. The main outcome of this work consists of the definition of the best hyperparameters to set, in order to perform Portfolio Optimization by VQE on real quantum computers. In particular, a quite general formulation of the constrained quadratic problem is considered, which is translated into Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization by the binary encoding of variables and by including constraints in the objective function. This is converted into a set of quantum operators (Ising Hamiltonian), whose minimum eigenvalue is found by VQE and corresponds to the optimal solution. In this work, different hyperparameters of the procedure are analyzed, including different ansatzes and optimization methods by means of experiments on both simulators and real quantum computers. Experiments show that there is a strong dependence of solutions quality on the sufficiently sized quantum computer and correct hyperparameters, and with the best choices, the quantum algorithm run on real quantum devices reaches solutions very close to the exact one, with a strong convergence rate towards the classical solution, even without error-mitigation techniques. Moreover, results obtained on different real quantum devices, for a small-sized example, show the relation between the quality of the solution and the dimension of the quantum processor. Evidences allow concluding which are the best ways to solve real Portfolio Optimization problems by VQE on quantum devices, and confirm the possibility to solve them with higher efficiency, with respect to existing methods, as soon as the size of quantum hardware will be sufficiently high.

TI Exploring Bell nonlocality of quantum networks with stabilizing and
   logical operators
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB In practical quantum networks, a variety of multiqubit stabilized states emitted from independent sources are distributed among the agents, and the correlations across the entire network can be derived from each agent's local measurements on the shared composite quantum systems. To reveal the Bell nonlocality in such cases as a quantum feature, minimal knowledge of the emitted stabilizer state is required. Here, we demonstrate that knowing the stabilizing and logical operators indeed provides a way of exploring Bell nonlocality in quantum networks. For the qubit distribution in quantum networks, the associated nonlinear Bell inequalities are derived. On the other hand, to violate these inequalities, one can design local incompatible observables using minimal knowledge of the emitted states. The tilted nonlinear Bell inequalities tailored for specific nonmaximal entangled stabilizer states and a way of achieving the maximal violation are also explored.

TI Efficient Pause Location Prediction Using Quantum Annealing Simulations
   and Machine Learning
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB Despite increases in qubit count and connectivity in quantum annealers, a quantum speedup has yet to be observed for problems of practical significance. In order to further improve annealer performance, some researchers focus on tuning annealer parameters, such as the annealing schedule. In this work, we focus on pausing, an annealing schedule modification that has been shown to improve the probability of solving an optimization problem by orders of magnitude. However, a challenge associated with pausing is selecting an appropriate pause location, as pausing is only effective in problem-dependent regions and ineffective elsewhere. Moreover, there is little advice on how to determine where pausing is effective. Thus, pausing effectively is difficult and often inaccessible to the majority of users. To address these issues, we propose a data-driven method that leverages machine learning to predict optimal pause locations. First, we construct a dataset consisting of optimization problems and their corresponding optimal pause locations. The optimal pause locations are determined using spin-vector Monte Carlo, a method known to yield results similar to quantum annealing. Next, we train a convolutional neural network on this dataset, demonstrating its ability to distinguish between problem types and accurately predict the optimal pause location. Finally, we evaluate the model on multiple types of optimization problems. Our results show that the pause locations predicted by our method improve solution quality for all selected problem types. Additionally, our model can be pre-trained and easily distributed, making the power of pausing accessible to users unfamiliar with annealing schedule modifications.

TI Modular source for near-infrared quantum communication
SO EPJ QUANTUM TECHNOLOGY
AB We present a source of states for Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) based on a modular design exploiting the iPOGNAC, a stable, low-error, and calibration-free polarization modulation scheme, for both intensity and polarization encoding. This source is immune to the security vulnerabilities of other state sources such as side channels and some quantum hacking attacks. Remarkably, our intensity modulation scheme allows full tunability of the intensity ratio between the decoy and signal states, and mitigates patterning effects. The source was implemented and tested at the near-infrared optical band around 800 nm, of particular interest for satellite-based QKD. Furthermore, the modularity of the source simplifies its development, testing, and qualification, especially for space missions. For these reasons, our work paves the way for the development of the second generation of QKD satellites that can guarantee excellent performances at higher security levels.

TI Testing quantum theory on curved spacetime with quantum networks
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Quantum technologies present new opportunities for fundamental tests of nature. One potential application is to probe the interplay between quantum physics and general relativity-a field of physics with no empirical evidence yet. Here we show that quantum networks open a new window to test this interface. We demonstrate how photon mediated entanglement between atomic or atomlike systems can be used to probe time-dilation-induced entanglement and interference modulation. Key are nonlocal measurements between clocks in a gravitational field, which can be achieved either through direct photon interference or by using auxiliary entanglement. The resulting observable depends on the interference between different proper times, and can only be explained if both quantum theory and general relativity are taken into account. The proposed protocol enables clock interferometry on kilometer-scale separations and beyond. Our work thus shows a realistic experimental route for a first test of quantum theory on curved spacetime, opening up new scientific opportunities for quantum networks.

TI Color-detuning-dynamics-based quantum sensing with dressed states
   driving
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB Exploring quantum technology to precisely measure physical quantities is a meaningful task for practical scientific researches. Here, we propose a novel quantum sensing model based on color detuning dynamics with dressed states driving (DSD) in stimulated Raman adiabatic passage. The model is valid for sensing different physical quantities, such as magnetic field, mass, rotation and so on. For different sensors, the used systems can range from macroscopic scale, e.g. optomechanical systems, to microscopic nanoscale, e.g. solid spin systems. The dynamics of color detuning of DSD passage indicates the sensitivity of sensors can be enhanced by tuning system with more adiabatic or accelerated processes in different color detuning regimes. To show application examples, we apply our approach to build optomechanical mass sensor and solid spin magnetometer with practical parameters.

TI High-dimensional quantum key distribution with resource-efficient
   detection
SO OPTICA QUANTUM
AB While quantum key distribution (QKD) based on two-dimensional (qubit) encoding is a mature, field-tested technology, its performance is lacking for many cryptographic applications. High-dimensional encoding for QKD enables increased achievable key rates and robustness as compared to the standard qubit-based systems. However, experimental implementations of such systems are more complicated, expensive, and require careful security analysis as they are less common. In this work, we present a proof-of-principle high-dimensional time-phase BB84 QKD experiment using only one single-photon detector per measurement basis. We employ the temporal Talbot effect to detect QKD symbols in the control basis and show experimentally obtained simplistic key rates for the two-dimensional and four-dimensional cases, including in an urban fiber network. We present a comparison of a simplistic secret key rate obtained from a standard security proof with the one derived from a recently devised proof using a tunable beam splitter to display security issues stemming from asymmetric detection efficiencies in the two bases. Our results contribute to the discussion of the benefits of high-dimensional encoding and highlight the impact of security analysis on the achievable QKD performance.

TI Passive Continuous Variable Quantum Key Distribution through the Oceanic
   Turbulence
SO ENTROPY
AB Continuous variable quantum key distribution (CVQKD) can be potentially implemented through seawater channels, whereas the involved oceanic turbulence has a negative effect on the maximal transmission distance of quantum communication systems. Here, we demonstrate the effects of the oceanic turbulence on the performance of the CVQKD system and suggest an implementation feasibility of the passive CVQKD through the oceanic turbulence-based channel. We achieve the channel transmittance characterized by the transmission distance and depth of the seawater. Moreover, a non-Gaussian approach is used for performance improvement while counteracting the effects of excess noises on the oceanic channel. Numerical simulations show that the photon operation (PO) unit can bring reductions of excess noise when taking into account the oceanic turbulence, and hence results in performance improvement in terms of transmission distance and depth as well. The passive CVQKD explores the intrinsic field fluctuations of a thermal source without using an active scheme and hence has a promising application in chip integration for portable quantum communications.

TI Classical ensembles of single-qubit quantum variational circuits for
   classification
SO QUANTUM MACHINE INTELLIGENCE
AB The quantum asymptotically universal multi-feature (QAUM) encoding architecture was recently introduced and showed improved expressivity and performance in classifying pulsar stars. The circuit uses generalized trainable layers of parameterized single-qubit rotation gates and single-qubit feature encoding gates. Although the improvement in classification accuracy is promising, the single-qubit nature of this architecture, combined with the circuit depth required for accuracy, limits its applications on NISQ devices due to their low coherence times. This work reports on the design, implementation, and evaluation of ensembles of single-qubit QAUM classifiers using classical bagging and boosting techniques. We demonstrate an improvement in validation accuracy for pulsar star classification. We find that this improvement is not dataset specific as we observe consistent improvements for the MNIST Digits and Wisconsin Cancer datasets. We also observe that the boosting ensemble achieves an acceptable level of accuracy with only a small amount of training, while the bagging ensemble achieves higher overall accuracy with ample training time. This shows that classical ensembles of single-qubit circuits present a new approach for certain classification problems.

TI Long-range quantum correlations based on quantum coherence in a hybrid
   system
SO NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB We propose a scheme to realize long-range quantum correlations of two separated ensembles of nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers via asymmetric driving. Either of the ensembles of NV centers is dynamically driven by a strong applied microwave field, which causes the coupled energy levels to split into dressed states. A quantum electromechanical system (QEMS), as a quantum data bus, connects the two ensembles of NV centers. When a weak microwave field in QEMS couples the same energy level transitions of the two ensembles of NV centers, the beam-splitter-like interactions are realized. The collective mode of the mechanical resonators in the QEMS is near-resonant with the dressed energy level establishing the parametric down-conversion-like interaction. The Kerr nonlinearity produced by the parametric down-conversion-like interaction can be transferred by the beam-splitter-like interactions. We demonstrate the photon-phonon one-way Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen steering, and spin squeezing. Our scheme can thereafter support a potential application of the generalized storage of quantum information.

TI Efficient and Secure Measure-Resend Authenticated Semi-Quantum Key
   Distribution Protocol against Reflecting Attack
SO MATHEMATICS
AB In 2021, Chang et al. proposed an authenticated semi-quantum key-distribution (ASQKD) protocol using single photons and an authenticated channel. However, an eavesdropper can launch a reflective attack to forge the receiver's identity without being detected. In addition, Chang et al.'s ASQKD protocol assumes an authenticated classical channel between the sender and the receiver. It is considered illogical to have an authenticated channel in the ASQKD protocol. If these security issues are not addressed, the ASQKD protocol will fail to deliver the secret key. Therefore, this study proposes an efficient and secure ASQKD protocol to circumvent these problems using only single photons. Security analysis proves that the proposed ASQKD protocol can effectively avoid reflecting attacks, collective attacks, and other typical attacks. Compared with the existing ASQKD protocols, this study has the following advantages: based on a single photon, it demands less advanced quantum devices, the communication efficiency is higher than most protocols, it reduces the length of the required pre-shared keys, endures reflecting attacks, collective attacks, and there is no need for the classical channel.

TI Tunable Geometries in Sparse Clifford Circuits
SO SYMMETRY-BASEL
AB We investigate the emergence of different effective geometries in stochastic Clifford circuits with sparse coupling. By changing the probability distribution for choosing two-site gates as a function of distance, we generate sparse interactions that either decay or grow with distance as a function of a single tunable parameter. Tuning this parameter reveals three distinct regimes of geometry for the spreading of correlations and growth of entanglement in the system. We observe linear geometry for short-range interactions, treelike geometry on a sparse coupling graph for long-range interactions, and an intermediate fast scrambling regime at the crossover point between the linear and treelike geometries. This transition in geometry is revealed in calculations of the subsystem entanglement entropy and tripartite mutual information. We also study emergent lightcones that govern these effective geometries by teleporting a single qubit of information from an input qubit to an output qubit. These tools help to analyze distinct geometries arising in dynamics and correlation spreading in quantum many-body systems.

TI Quantum Machine Learning Approach for Studying Atmospheric Cluster
   Formation
SO ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY LETTERS
AB Quantum chemical (QC) calculations can yield direct insight into an atmospheric cluster formation mechanism and cluster formation rates. However, such calculations are extremely computationally demanding as more than millions of cluster configurations might exist and need to be computed. We present an efficient approach to produce high quality QC data sets for applications in cluster formation studies and how to train an accurate quantum machine learning model on the generated data. Using the two-component sulfuric acid-water system as a proof of concept, we demonstrate that a kernel ridge regression machine learning model with Delta-learning can be trained to accurately predict the binding energies of cluster equilibrium configurations with mean absolute errors below 0.5 kcal mol(-1). Additionally, we enlarge the training data set with nonequilibrium configurations and show the possibility of predicting the binding energies of new structures of clusters several molecules larger than those in the training set. Applying the trained machine learning model leads to a drastic reduction in the number of relevant clusters that need to be explicitly evaluated by QC methods. The presented approach is directly transferable to clusters of arbitrary composition and will lead to faster and more efficient exploration of the configurational space of new cluster systems.

TI Applicability of Squeezed- and Coherent-State Continuous-Variable
   Quantum Key Distribution over Satellite Links
SO ENTROPY
AB We address the applicability of quantum key distribution with continuous-variable coherent and squeezed states over long-distance satellite-based links, considering low Earth orbits and taking into account strong varying channel attenuation, atmospheric turbulence and finite data ensemble size effects. We obtain tight security bounds on the untrusted excess noise on the channel output, which suggest that substantial efforts aimed at setup stabilization and reduction of noise and loss are required, or the protocols can be realistically implemented over satellite links once either individual or passive collective attacks are assumed. Furthermore, splitting the satellite pass into discrete segments and extracting the key from each rather than from the overall single pass allows one to effectively improve robustness against the untrusted channel noise and establish a secure key under active collective attacks. We show that feasible amounts of optimized signal squeezing can substantially improve the applicability of the protocols allowing for lower system clock rates and aperture sizes and resulting in higher robustness against channel attenuation and noise compared to the coherent-state protocol.

TI Non-hemolytic peptide classification using a quantum support vector
   machine
SO QUANTUM INFORMATION PROCESSING
AB Quantum machine learning (QML) is one of the most promising applications of quantum computation. Despite the theoretical advantages, it is still unclear exactly what kind of problems QML techniques can be used for, given the current limitation of noisy intermediate-scale quantum devices. In this work, we apply the well-studied quantum support vector machine (QSVM), a powerful QML model, to a binary classification task which classifies peptides as either hemolytic or non-hemolytic. Using three peptide datasets, we apply and contrast the performance of the QSVM with a number of popular classical SVMs, out of which the QSVM performs best overall. The contributions of this work include: (i) the first application of the QSVM to this specific peptide classification task and (ii) empirical results showing that the QSVM is capable of outperforming many (and possibly all) classical SVMs on this classification task. This foundational work provides insight into possible applications of QML in computational biology and may facilitate safer therapeutic developments by improving our ability to identify hemolytic properties in peptides.

TI Exploring the thermodynamics of disordered materials with quantum
   computing
SO SCIENCE ADVANCES
AB Alloys, solid solutions, and doped systems are essential in technologies such as energy generation and catalysis, but predicting their properties remains challenging because of compositional disorder. As the concentration of components changes in a binary solid solution A(1-x)Bx , the number of possible configurations becomes computationally intractable. Algorithms used in classical optimization methods cannot avoid assessing high-energy states where, for example, simulated annealing is designed to initially spend computational effort. We introduce a scalable, practical, and accurate approach using quantum annealing to efficiently sample low-energy configurations of disordered materials, avoiding the need for excessive high-energy calculations. Our method includes temperature and simulates large unit cells, producing a Boltzmann-like distribution to identify thermodynamically relevant structures. We demonstrate this by predicting bandgap bowing in Al1-xGaxN and bulk modulus variations in Ta1-xWx , with results in excellent agreement with experiments.

TI Recovering Quantum Coherence of a Cavity Qubit Coupled to a Noisy
   Ancilla through Real-Time Feedback
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW X
AB Decoherence in qubits, caused by their interaction with a noisy environment, poses a significant challenge to the development of reliable quantum processors. A prominent source of errors arises from noise in coupled ancillas, which can quickly spread to qubits. By actively monitoring these noisy ancillas, it is possible to not only identify qubit decoherence events but also to correct these errors in real time. This approach is particularly beneficial for bosonic qubits, where the interaction with ancillas is a dominant source of decoherence. In this work, we uncover the intricate dynamics of decoherence in a superconducting cavity qubit due to its interaction with a noisy transmon ancilla. By tracking the noisy ancilla trajectory and using real-time feedback, we successfully recover the lost coherence of the cavity qubit, achieving a fivefold increase in its pure dephasing time. Additionally, by detecting ancilla errors and converting them into erasures, we improve the pure dephasing time by more than an order of magnitude. These advances are essential for realizing long-lived cavity qubits with high-fidelity gates, and they pave the way for more efficient bosonic quantum error-correction codes.

TI Influence of dipole interaction on the quantum correlation detection and
   teleportation in a qubit-field system
SO JOURNAL OF KING SAUD UNIVERSITY SCIENCE
AB This study examines the analysis of the teleportation process in a two-qubit state, particularly scrutinizing the interplay of atomic dipole coupling interaction, the detuning parameter, photon count, and the surrounding environment. Our investigation assumes the existence of a teleportation channel comprising two-qubit systems interacting with a photon field enveloped by the dephasing environment. Within this framework, we closely examine the quantum correlations exhibited by the teleported state, encompassing dimensions of entanglement, steering, and non -locality. Our results underscore the pivotal role played by the initial state of the atomic and field subsystems in shaping quantum relations. The dipole coupling has a profound impact, significantly enhancing the three quantifiers. Particularly, the entanglement changes from a de -entangled state to a partially entangled state. On the other hand, the detuning parameter introduces distortion in the quantum correlations, a phenomenon that can be effectively mitigated by controlling the dipole coupling.

TI Enhancing the Q-Factor of a Practical Qubit Niobium Three-Dimensional
   λ/4-Resonator Through Surface Treatment
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON APPLIED SUPERCONDUCTIVITY
AB Quantum computing stands as a revolutionary frontier in information technology, with the potential to solve complex problems far beyond the capacity of classical computers. At the heart of this disruptive innovation are qubits, forming the fundamental backbone of quantum computing. A leading-edge solution for constructing robust, enduring qubits involves embedding a Josephson junction within a high Q-factor, superconducting three-dimensional cavity. Our recent innovation lies in developing a uniquely optimized, quarter-wave resonator-based superconducting cavity, functioning at 6 GHz, specifically tailored for quantum computers. In this work, we elucidate our advancement towards elevating the Q-factor tenfold, an achievement made possible through the enhancement of machining precision, the application of rigorous postprocessing techniques-including mechanical, chemical, and surface treatments-as well as the refinement of our testing methods.

TI 6G secure quantum communication: a success probability prediction model
SO AUTOMATED SOFTWARE ENGINEERING
AB The emergence of 6G networks initiates significant transformations in the communication technology landscape. Yet, the melding of quantum computing (QC) with 6G networks although promising an array of benefits, particularly in secure communication. Adapting QC into 6G requires a rigorous focus on numerous critical variables. This study aims to identify key variables in secure quantum communication (SQC) in 6G and develop a model for predicting the success probability of 6G-SQC projects. We identified key 6G-SQC variables from existing literature to achieve these objectives and collected training data by conducting a questionnaire survey. We then analyzed these variables using an optimization model, i.e., Genetic Algorithm (GA), with two different prediction methods the Naive Bayes Classifier (NBC) and Logistic Regression (LR). The results of success probability prediction models indicate that as the 6G-SQC matures, project success probability significantly increases, and costs are notably reduced. Furthermore, the best fitness rankings for each 6G-SQC project variable determined using NBC and LR indicated a strong positive correlation (rs = 0.895). The t-test results (t = 0.752, p = 0.502 > 0.05) show no significant differences between the rankings calculated using both prediction models (NBC and LR). The results reveal that the developed success probability prediction model, based on 15 identified 6G-SQC project variables, highlights the areas where practitioners need to focus more to facilitate the cost-effective and successful implementation of 6G-SQC projects.

TI Overcoming the rate-distance limit of device-independent quantum key
   distribution
SO OPTICS LETTERS
AB Device-independent quantum key distribution (DIQKD) exploits the violation of a Bell inequality to extract secure keys even if users' devices are untrusted. Currently, all DIQKD protocols suffer from the secret key capacity bound, i.e., the secret key rate scales linearly with the transmittance of two users. Here we propose a heralded DIQKD scheme based on entangled coherent states to improve entangling rates whereby long-distance entanglement is created by single-photon-type interference. The secret key rate of our scheme can significantly outperform the traditional two-photon-type Bell-state measurement scheme and, importantly, surpass the above capacity bound. Our protocol therefore is an important step towards a realization of DIQKD and can be a promising candidate scheme for entanglement swapping in the future quantum internet.

AB The continuous quadratures of a single mode of the light field present a promising avenue to encode quantum information. By virtue of the infinite dimensionality of the associated Hilbert space, quantum states of these continuous variables (CV) can enable higher communication rates compared to single photon-based qubit encodings. Quantum repeater protocols that are essential to extend the range of quantum communications at enhanced rates over direct transmission have also been recently proposed for CV quantum encodings. Here we present a quantum repeating switch for CV quantum encodings that caters to multiple communication flows. The architecture of the switch is based on quantum light sources, detectors, memories, and switching fabric, and the routing protocol is based on a Max-Weight scheduling policy that is throughput optimal. We present numerical results on an achievable bipartite entanglement request rate region for multiple CV entanglement flows that can be stably supported through the switch. We elucidate our results with the help of exemplary 3-flow networks.

TI Faster Digital Quantum Simulation by Symmetry Protection
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB Simulating the dynamics of quantum systems is an important application of quantum computers and has seen a variety of implementations on current hardware. We show that by introducing quantum gates implementing unitary transformations generated by the symmetries of the system, one can induce destructive interference between the errors from different steps of the simulation, effectively giving faster quantum simulation by symmetry protection. We derive rigorous bounds on the error of a symmetry-protected simulation algorithm and identify conditions for optimal symmetry protection. In particular, when the symmetry transformations are chosen as powers of a unitary, the error of the algorithm is approximately projected to the so-called quantum Zeno subspaces. We prove a bound on this approximation error, exponentially improving a recent result of Burgarth, Facchi, Gramegna, and Pascazio. We apply the symmetry-protection technique to the simulations of the XXZ Heisenberg interactions with local disorder and the Schwinger model in quantum field theory. For both systems, the technique can reduce the simulation error by several orders of magnitude over the unprotected simulation. Finally, we provide numerical evidence suggesting that the technique can also protect simulation against other types of coherent, temporally correlated errors, such as the 1/f noise commonly found in solid-state experiments.

TI Geometric properties of qudit systems
SO PHYSICA SCRIPTA
AB We discuss in general the geometric properties of qudit systems, with a particular interest in thermal states. The principle of maximum entropy is used to study the geometric properties of an ensemble of finite dimensional Hamiltonian systems with known average energy. These geometric characterizations are given in terms of the generalized diagonal Bloch vectors and the invariants of the special unitary group in n dimensions. As examples, Hamiltonians written in terms of linear and quadratic generators of the angular momentum algebra are considered and explicitly visualized with J = 1 and J = 3/2. For these cases, paths as functions of the temperature are established in the corresponding simplex representations, which show first- and second-order quantum phase transitions, as well as the adiabatic evolution of the interaction strengths (control parameters) of the Hamiltonian models. For the Lipkin-Meshkov-Glick Hamiltonian the quantum phase diagram is explicitly shown for different temperature values in parameter space.

TI Quantum Remote State Preparation Based on Quantum Network Coding
SO CMC-COMPUTERS MATERIALS & CONTINUA
AB As an innovative theory and technology, quantum network coding has become the research hotspot in quantum network communications. In this paper, a quantum remote state preparation scheme based on quantum network coding is proposed. Comparing with the general quantum remote state preparation schemes, our proposed scheme brings an arbitrary unknown quantum state finally prepared remotely through the quantum network, by designing the appropriate encoding and decoding steps for quantum network coding. What is worth mentioning, from the network model, this scheme is built on the quantum k-pair network which is the expansion of the typical bottleneck network???butterfly network. Accordingly, it can be treated as an efficient quantum network preparation scheme due to the characteristics of network coding, and it also makes the proposed scheme more applicable to the large-scale quantum networks. In addition, the fact of an arbitrary unknown quantum state remotely prepared means that the senders do not need to know the desired quantum state. Thus, the security of the proposed scheme is higher. Moreover, this scheme can always achieve the success probability of 1 and 1-max flow of value k. Thus, the communication efficiency of the proposed scheme is higher. Therefore, the proposed scheme turns out to be practicable, secure and efficient, which helps to effectively enrich the theory of quantum remote state preparation.

TI Variational Simulation of the Lipkin-Meshkov-Glick Model on a Neutral
   Atom Quantum Computer
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB We simulate the Lipkin-Meshkov-Glick model using the variational-quantum-eigensolver algorithm on a neutral atom quantum computer. We test the ground-state energy of spin systems with up to 15 spins. Two different encoding schemes are used: an individual spin encoding where each spin is represented by one qubit, and an efficient Gray code encoding scheme that only requires a number of qubits that scales with the logarithm of the number of spins. This more efficient encoding, together with zero-noise extrapolation techniques, is shown to improve the fidelity of the simulated energies with respect to exact solutions.

TI Parameter estimation in quantum sensing based on deep reinforcement
   learning
SO NPJ QUANTUM INFORMATION
AB Parameter estimation is a pivotal task, where quantum technologies can enhance precision greatly. We investigate the time-dependent parameter estimation based on deep reinforcement learning, where the noise-free and noisy bounds of parameter estimation are derived from a geometrical perspective. We propose a physical-inspired linear time-correlated control ansatz and a general well-defined reward function integrated with the derived bounds to accelerate the network training for fast generating quantum control signals. In the light of the proposed scheme, we validate the performance of time-dependent and time-independent parameter estimation under noise-free and noisy dynamics. In particular, we evaluate the transferability of the scheme when the parameter has a shift from the true parameter. The simulation showcases the robustness and sample efficiency of the scheme and achieves the state-of-the-art performance. Our work highlights the universality and global optimality of deep reinforcement learning over conventional methods in practical parameter estimation of quantum sensing.

TI Intensity-difference squeezing from four-wave mixing in hot
   85Rb and 87Rb atoms in single diode laser pumping
   system
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB Squeezed states of light, generated through four-wave mixing (FWM), are increasingly recognized as valuable resources for various applications in quantum sensing, quantum imaging, and quantum information processing. In this study, we report achieving more than - 7.8 dB of intensity-difference squeezing (IDS) in two-mode squeezed states from hot 85Rb vapor and - 5.0 dB from hot 87Rb vapor, utilizing a fiber electro-optic modulator (EOM) within a single home-made diode laser system. By mitigating the effects of undesired multimode from the EOM on the squeezing, we experimentally demonstrated the IDS of 85Rb and 87Rb atoms within a single experimental setup, benefiting from the EOM's ability to provide higher frequency shifts. This advancement may expand the scope of applications for hot atomic-vapor-based quantum technologies, leveraging the capabilities of the EOM.

TI Room-Temperature, Highly Pure Single-Photon Sources from AllInorganic
   Lead Halide Perovskite Quantum Dots
SO NANO LETTERS
AB Attaining pure single-photon emission is key for many quantum technologies, from optical quantum computing to quantum key distribution and quantum imaging. The past 20 years have seen the development of several solid-state quantum emitters, but most of them require highly sophisticated techniques (e.g., ultrahigh vacuum growth methods and cryostats for low-temperature operation). The system complexity may be significantly reduced by employing quantum emitters capable of working at room temperature. Here, we present a systematic study across similar to 170 photostable single CsPbX3 (X: Br and I) colloidal quantum dots (QDs) of different sizes and compositions, unveiling that increasing quantum confinement is an effective strategy for maximizing single-photon purity due to the suppressed biexciton quantum yield. Leveraging the latter, we achieve 98% single-photon purity (g(2)(0) as low as 2%) from a cavity-free, nonresonantly excited single 6.6 nm CsPbI3 QDs, showcasing the great potential of CsPbX3 QDs as room-temperature highly pure single-photon sources for quantum technologies

TI Quantum entanglement in top quark pair production
SO NUCLEAR PHYSICS A
AB Top quarks, the most massive particles in the standard model, attract considerable attention since they decay before hadronizing. This presents physicists with a unique opportunity to directly investigate their properties. In this letter, we expand upon the work of G. Iskander, J. Pan, M. Tyler, C. Weber and O. K. Baker to demonstrate that even with the most massive fundamental particle, we see the same manifestation of entanglement observed in both electroweak and electromagnetic interactions. We propose that the thermal component resulting from protons colliding into two top quarks emerges from entanglement within the two-proton wave function. The presence of entanglement implies the coexistence of both thermal and hard scattering components in the transverse momentum distribution. We use published ATLAS and CMS results to show that the data exhibits the expected behavior.

TI Color centers in wide-bandgap semiconductors for subdiffraction imaging:
   a review
SO ADVANCED PHOTONICS
AB Solid-state atomic-sized color centers in wide-band-gap semiconductors, such as diamond, silicon carbide, and hexagonal boron nitride, are important platforms for quantum technologies, specifically for single-photon sources and quantum sensing. One of the emerging applications of these quantum emitters is subdiffraction imaging. This capability is provided by the specific photophysical properties of color centers, such as high dipole moments, photostability, and a variety of spectral ranges of the emitters with associated optical and microwave control of their quantum states. We review applications of color centers in traditional super-resolution microscopy and quantum imaging methods, and compare relative performance. The current state and perspectives of their applications in biomedical, chemistry, and material science imaging are outlined.

TI Two Novel Semi-Quantum Secure Direct Communication Protocols in IoT
SO SENSORS
AB As Internet of Things (IoT) technology continues to advance, there is a growing awareness of IoT security within the industry. Quantum communication technology can potentially significantly improve the communication security of IoT devices. Based on semi-quantum cryptography and utilizing single photons, this paper introduces two semi-quantum secure direct communication (SQSDC) protocols for use in smart door locks. Protocol 1 is more efficient, and the efficiency analysis shows that the communication efficiency is as high as 28.57%. Security analysis demonstrates the asymptotic security of the protocols, effectively resisting intercept-measure-resend attacks and entangle-measure attacks from potential eavesdroppers. The extended SQSDC protocol (protocol 2) builds upon protocol 1 by enabling a single qubit to transmit two bits of information, resulting in a double efficiency outcome.

TI Investigating the Individual Performances of Coupled Superconducting
   Transmon Qubits
SO CONDENSED MATTER
AB The strong requirement for high-performing quantum computing led to intensive research on novel quantum platforms in the last decades. The circuital nature of Josephson-based quantum superconducting systems powerfully supports massive circuital freedom, which allowed for the implementation of a wide range of qubit designs, and an easy interface with the quantum processing unit. However, this unavoidably introduces a coupling with the environment, and thus to extra decoherence sources. Moreover, at the time of writing, control and readout protocols mainly use analogue microwave electronics, which limit the otherwise reasonable scalability in superconducting quantum circuits. Within the future perspective to improve scalability by integrating novel control energy-efficient superconducting electronics at the quantum stage in a multi-chip module, we report on an all-microwave characterization of a planar two-transmon qubits device, which involves state-of-the-art control pulses optimization. We demonstrate that the single-qubit average gate fidelity is mainly limited by the gate pulse duration and the quality of the optimization, and thus does not preclude the integration in novel hybrid quantum-classical superconducting devices.

TI Multi-qubit correction for quantum annealers
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB We present multi-qubit correction (MQC) as a novel postprocessing method for quantum annealers that views the evolution in an open-system as a Gibbs sampler and reduces a set of excited states to a new synthetic state with lower energy value. After sampling from the ground state of a given (Ising) Hamiltonian, MQC compares pairs of excited states to recognize virtual tunnels-i.e., a group of qubits that changing their states simultaneously can result in a new state with lower energy value-and successively converges to the ground state. Experimental results using D-Wave 2000Q quantum annealers demonstrate that MQC finds samples with notably lower energy values and improves the reproducibility of results when compared to recent hardware/software advances in the realm of quantum annealing, such as spin-reversal transforms, classical postprocessing techniques, and increased inter-sample delay between successive measurements.

TI Surpassing 99% detection efficiency by cascading two superconducting
   nanowires on one waveguide with self-calibration
SO LIGHT-SCIENCE & APPLICATIONS
AB Integrated quantum photonics (IQP) allows for on-chip generation, manipulation and detection of quantum states of light, fostering advancements in quantum communication, quantum computing, and quantum information technologies. Single-photon detector is a key device in IQP that allows for efficient readout of quantum information through the detection of single-photon statistics and measurement of photonic quantum states. The efficacy of quantum information retrieval hinges on the ability to simultaneously detect every single photon with high efficiency, a relationship that grows exponentially with the number of photons (n). Even a slight decrease in single photon detection efficiency can lead to a significant reduction in probability as n grows larger. Here, we introduce a superconductor-semiconductor heterogeneous integration technology that allows for the integration of transversal superconducting nanowires single-photon detectors that eliminate corner loss on various optical waveguides with exceptional efficiency and versatility. Two cascaded nanowires have been integrated on one silicon waveguide, which not only boosts the detection efficiency to 99.73% at a wavelength of 1550 nm but also provides an on-chip calibration setup, allowing such high efficiency to be measured despite the large loss from fiber-to-waveguide coupling and uncertainties from absolute power calibrations. These advancements represent a substantial improvement compared to previous records, approaching the theoretical limit achievable on silicon waveguide, and demonstrate the versatility of heterogeneous integration technology. This breakthrough in ultra-high detection efficiency establishes a new baseline for assessing quantum measurement capabilities on scalable IQP platforms.

TI Strong* convergence of quantum channels
SO QUANTUM INFORMATION PROCESSING
AB Recently, the existence of a strongly converging sequence of quantum channels that cannot be represented a reduction of a sequence of unitary channels strongly converging to a unitary channelwas shown. In thiswork, we obtain several characterizations of sequences of quantum channels that have the above representation. The corresponding convergence is called the strong* convergence, since we have found that it is related to the convergence of selective Stinespring isometries in the strong* operator topology. We present the arguments showing that the strong* convergence is a proper, physically motivated type of convergence of infinite-dimensional quantum channels. Some properties of the strong* convergence of quantum channels are considered. It is shown that for Bosonic Gaussian channels the strong* convergence coincides with the strong convergence.

TI Deterministic entanglement distribution on series-parallel quantum
   networks
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB (Received 2021; accepted February 2023; published 2023) The performance of distributing entanglement between two distant nodes in a large-scale quantum network (QN) of partially entangled bipartite pure states is generally benchmarked against the classical entanglement per-colation (CEP) scheme. Improvements beyond CEP were only achieved by nonscalable strategies for restricted QN topologies. This paper explores and amplifies a new and more effective mapping of a QN, referred to as concurrence percolation theory (ConPT), that suggests using deterministic rather than probabilistic protocols for scalably improving on CEP across arbitrary QN topology. More precisely, we implement ConPT via a deter-ministic entanglement transmission (DET) scheme that is fully analogous to resistor network analysis, with the corresponding series and parallel rules represented by deterministic entanglement swapping and concentration protocols, respectively. The main contribution of this paper is to establish a powerful mathematical framework, which is applicable to arbitrary d-dimensional information carriers (qudits), that provides different natural optimality metrics in terms of generalized k-concurrences (a family of fundamental entanglement measures) for different QN topologies. In particular, we conclude that the introduced DET scheme (a) is optimal over the well-known nested repeater protocol for distilling entanglement from partially entangled qubits and (b) leads to higher success probabilities of obtaining a maximally entangled state than using CEP. The implementation of the DET scheme is experimentally feasible as tested on IBM's quantum computation platform.

TI Constant Overhead Quantum Fault Tolerance with Quantum Expander Codes
SO COMMUNICATIONS OF THE ACM
AB The threshold theorem is a seminal result in the field of quantum computing asserting that arbitrarily long quantum computations can be performed on a faulty quantum computer provided that the noise level is below some constant threshold. This remarkable result comes at the price of increasing the number of qubits (quantum bits) by a large factor that scales polylogarithmically with the size of the quantum computation we wish to realize. Minimizing the space overhead for fault-tolerant quantum computation is a pressing challenge that is crucial to benefit from the computational potential of quantum devices.
   In this paper, we study the asymptotic scaling of the space overhead needed for fault-tolerant quantum computation. We show that the polylogarithmic factor in the standard threshold theorem is in fact not needed and that there is a fault-tolerant construction that uses a number of qubits that is only a constant factor more than the number of qubits of the ideal computation. This result was conjectured by Gottesman who suggested to replace the concatenated codes from the standard threshold theorem by quantum error-correcting codes with a constant encoding rate. The main challenge was then to find an appropriate family of quantum codes together with an efficient classical decoding algorithm working even with a noisy syndrome. The efficiency constraint is crucial here: bear in mind that qubits are inherently noisy and that faults keep accumulating during the decoding process. The role of the decoder is therefore to keep the number of errors under control during the whole computation.
   On a technical level, our main contribution is the analysis of the SMALL-SET-FLIP decoding algorithm applied to the family of quantum expander codes. We show that it can be parallelized to run in constant time while correcting sufficiently many errors on both the qubits and the syndrome to keep the error under control. These tools can be seen as a quantum generalization of the BIT-FLIP algorithm applied to the (classical) expander codes of Sipser and Spielman.

TI Modeling noncovalent interatomic interactions on a photonic quantum
   computer
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Noncovalent interactions are a key ingredient to determine the structure, stability, and dynamics of materials, molecules, and biological complexes. However, accurately capturing these interactions is a complex quantum many-body problem, with no efficient solution available on classical computers. A widely used model to accurately and efficiently model noncovalent interactions is the Coulomb-coupled quantum Drude oscillator (cQDO) many-body Hamiltonian, for which no exact solution is known. We show that the cQDO model lends itself naturally to simulation on a photonic quantum computer, and we calculate the binding energy curve of diatomic systems by leveraging Xanadu's STRAWBERRY FIELDS photonics library. Our study substantially extends the applicability of quantum computing to atomistic modeling by showing a proof-of-concept application to noncovalent interactions, beyond the standard electronic-structure problem of small molecules. Remarkably, we find that two coupled bosonic QDOs exhibit a stable bond. In addition, our study suggests efficient functional forms for cQDO wave functions that can be optimized on classical computers, and capture the bonded-to-noncovalent transition for increasing interatomic distances.

TI Classical analog of qubit logic based on a magnon Bose-Einstein
   condensate
SO COMMUNICATIONS PHYSICS
AB Adding to the significant interest in quantum computing schemes, this work focuses on classical analogs for which entanglement is not required. Specifically, this work demonstrates through micromagnetic numerical simulations the use of wavevector-selective parametric pumping to controllably initialize and manipulate a room-temperature two-component magnon condensate on the Bloch sphere and reveals the possibility of Rabi-like oscillations in the wavevector domain.
   Advances in quantum computing and telecommunications stimulate the search for classical systems allowing partial implementation of a similar functionality under less stringent environmental conditions. Here, we present a classical version of several quantum bit (qubit) functionalities using a two-component magnon Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) formed at opposite wavevectors in a room-temperature yttrium-iron-garnet ferrimagnetic film. Employing micromagnetic numerical simulations, we show the use of wavelength-selective parametric pumping to controllably initialize and manipulate the two-component BEC. Next, by modeling the interaction of this BEC with a pulse- and radio-frequency-driven dynamic magnonic crystal we translate the concept of Rabi-oscillations into the wavevector domain and demonstrate how to manipulate the magnon-BEC system regarding the polar and azimuthal angles in the Bloch sphere representation. We hope that our study provides a significant stimulus on the boundary between qubit functionality and classical systems of interacting BECs, which use a subset of qubit-based algorithms.

TI Implementation of a 46-node quantum metropolitan area network
SO NPJ QUANTUM INFORMATION
AB Quantum key distribution (QKD) enables secure key exchanges between two remote users. The ultimate goal of secure communication is to establish a global quantum network. The existing field tests suggest that quantum networks are feasible. To achieve a practical quantum network, we need to overcome several challenges including realizing versatile topologies for large scales, simple network maintenance, extendable configuration and robustness to node failures. To this end, we present a field operation of a quantum metropolitan-area network with 46 nodes and show that all these challenges can be overcome with cutting-edge quantum technologies. In particular, we realize different topological structures and continuously run the network for 31 months, by employing standard equipment for network maintenance with an extendable configuration. We realize QKD pairing and key management with a sophisticated key control centre. In this implementation, the final keys have been used for secure communication such as real-time voice telephone, text messaging and file transmission with one-time pad encryption, which can support 11 pairs of users to make audio calls simultaneously. Combined with intercity quantum backbone and ground-satellite links, our metropolitan implementation paves the way toward a global quantum network.

TI QubiC: An Open-Source FPGA-Based Control and Measurement System for
   Superconducting Quantum Information Processors
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON QUANTUM ENGINEERING
AB As quantum information processors grow in quantum bit (qubit) count and functionality, the control and measurement system becomes a limiting factor to large-scale extensibility. To tackle this challenge and keep pace with rapidly evolving classical control requirements, full control stack access is essential to system-level optimization. We design a modular field-programmable gate array (FPGA)-based system called QubiC to control and measure a superconducting quantum processing unit. The system includes room temperature electronics hardware, FPGA gateware, and engineering software. A prototype hardware module is assembled from several commercial off-the-shelf evaluation boards and in-house-developed circuit boards. Gateware and software are designed to implement basic qubit control and measurement protocols. System functionality and performance are demonstrated by performing qubit chip characterization, gate optimization, and randomized benchmarking sequences on a superconducting quantum processor operating at the Advanced Quantum Testbed at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. The single-qubit and two-qubit process fidelities are measured to be 0.9980 +/- 0.0001 and 0.948 +/- 0.004, respectively, by randomized benchmarking. With fast circuit sequence loading capability, the QubiC performs randomized compiling experiments efficiently and improves the feasibility of executing more complex algorithms.

TI Evaluating the Computational Advantages of the Variational Quantum
   Circuit Model in Financial Fraud Detection
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB Home banking and digital payments diffusion has greatly increased in recent years. As a result, fraud has also dramatically grown, resulting in the loss of billions of dollars worldwide every year. Therefore, banks and financial institutions are required to offer clients increasingly effective and sophisticated services for illegal transaction detection. Machine learning strategies are commonly employed for this crucial application. However, classical models are not satisfactory enough in highly unbalanced classification tasks like fraud detection. Quantum machine learning, working intrinsically in a higher dimensional computation space thanks to superposition and entanglement, can express more complex models than its classical counterpart and thus could provide a significant advantage in identifying potential illegal transactions. This work aims to analyze the potential of quantum classifiers in the fraud detection context, focusing on the Variational Quantum Circuit (VQC) model. The study has been led by exploiting a dataset based on real transactions provided by Intesa Sanpaolo of 500000 items with 15 features. Considering the limitations of contemporary Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) computers and quantum simulators, the dataset has been reduced in the number of transactions and features, exploiting Principal Component Analysis (PCA). The results obtained have been compared on equal terms with those of the most commonly employed classical methods, such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, Support Vector Machine, and Neural Networks, obtaining a better classification quality in terms of recall. Even though this work is preliminary, the results are encouraging and prove the quantum models' potential in highly unbalanced classification tasks.

TI Efficient assessment of process fidelity
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB The accurate implementation of quantum gates is essential for the realization of quantum algorithms and digital quantum simulations. This accuracy may be increased on noisy hardware through the variational optimization of gates, however the experimental realization of such a protocol is impeded by the large effort required to estimate the fidelity of an implemented gate. With a hierarchy of approximations we find a faithful approximation to the quantum process fidelity that can be estimated experimentally with reduced effort. Its practical use is demonstrated with the optimization of a three-qubit quantum gate on a commercially available quantum processor.

TI Advancements in Entangled Photon Pairs in 2D Van der Waal Materials for
   On-Chip Quantum Device Applications
SO ADVANCED QUANTUM TECHNOLOGIES
AB The next generation of technology is rooted in quantum-based advancements. The entangled photon pair (EPP) sources play a pivotal role in such a wide range of advancements in quantum-based device applications, including quantum- high-precision sensors, communication, computing, cryptography, and so on. The bulk nonlinear crystals continue to dominate the current landscape of EPPs generation. However, emerging 2D quantum materials have demonstrated remarkable breakthroughs in both quantum photonics, nonlinear optics, and EPPs generation compared to conventional crystals. Their phase-matching-free spontaneous parametric down-conversion (SPDC), ultrashort coherence length, lowest crystal symmetry, exceptionally large and anisotropic second-order nonlinear susceptibility (), and seamless compatibility with on-chip, silicon-based photonic integration positions them as highly promising candidates for EPPs generation and next-generation quantum photonic and quantum device technologies. This review article highlights recent breakthroughs and advancements in the generation of EPPs in 2D van der Waals (vdW) materials, with a focus on their applicability to quantum technologies and plausible on-chip quantum integrated photonic device technology. The article begins by discussing the fundamental principles of EPPs generation. It provides a comprehensive review of the origin and generation of entangled photons in emerging layered vdW materials, alongside various optical quantum characterization techniques. The review then explores key physical parameters of the quantum states associated with EPPs. Additionally, it examines concepts related to the realization of paired photon generation at the quantum limit. The final section focuses on the potential for on-chip integrated quantum device applications. Beyond highlighting recent advancements in quantum-based research, the review also outlines the current limitations and future prospects aimed at advancing the field.

TI Fast polynomial inversion algorithms for the post-quantum cryptography
SO JOURNAL OF CRYPTOGRAPHIC ENGINEERING
AB Several cryptosystems suggested for the post-quantum cryptography candidates, including Falcon, BIKE, and NTRU, are defined in a polynomial ring. They must derive the inverse polynomial of any given polynomial for generating a public key. This process consumes considerable processing time; therefore, reducing the time to derive the inverse polynomial significantly improves many cryptosystems' performance. In this paper, we primarily suggest two polynomial inversion algorithms, combined-variable-time and combined-constant-time algorithms, based on the modification of the extended Euclidean algorithm. The combined-variable-time algorithm shows how to calculate the inverse polynomial by introducing the combined matrix fast, which is generated by merging several steps of the polynomial operations. In cryptosystems, to defend against side-channel attacks, the implementation with constant running time is essential in preventing information leakage. Thus, we propose the combined-constant-time polynomial inversion algorithm, which expends less running time than the conventional NTRU inversion algorithm. For binary polynomial inversion, the proposed combined-variable-time algorithm is 1.95 times faster than the variable-time algorithm used in the previous NTRU (Silverman Almost inverses and fast NTRU key creation, NTRU Tech Report, no. 014v1, Mar. 15, 1999), and the combined-constant-time algorithms are 1.43 times faster than the reference constant-time algorithms submitted to round 3 of the NIST PQC standardization, respectively. For ternary polynomial inversion, the proposed combined-variable-time and combined-constant-time algorithms are 1.59 and 1.29 times faster than the corresponding reference algorithms.

TI Closest Lattice Point Decoding for Multimode Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill
   Codes
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB Quantum error correction (QEC) plays an essential role in fault-tolerantly realizing quantum algorithms of practical interest. Among different approaches to QEC, encoding logical quantum information in harmonic oscillator modes has been shown to be promising and hardware efficient. In this work, we study multimode Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill (GKP) codes, encoding a qubit in many oscillators, through a lattice perspective. In particular, we implement a closest point decoding strategy for correcting random Gaussian shift errors. For decoding a generic multimode GKP code, we first identify its corresponding lattice followed by finding the closest lattice point in its symplectic dual lattice to a candidate shift error compatible with the error syndrome. We use this method to characterize the error-correction capabilities of several known multimode GKP codes, including their code distances and fidelities. We also perform numerical optimization of multimode GKP codes up to ten modes and find three instances (with three, seven, and nine modes) with better code distances and fidelities compared to the known GKP codes with the same number of modes. While exact closest point decoding incurs exponential time cost in the number of modes for general unstructured GKP codes, we give several examples of structured GKP codes (i.e., of the repetition-rectangular GKP code types) where the closest point decoding can be performed exactly in linear time. For the surface-GKP code, we show that the closest point decoding can be performed exactly in polynomial time with the help of a minimum-weight-perfect-matching algorithm (MWPM). We show that this MWPM closest point decoder improves both the fidelity and the noise threshold of the surfaceGKP code to 0.602 compared to the previously studied MWPM decoder assisted by log-likelihood analog information, which yields a noise threshold of 0.599.

TI Fast universal quantum gate above the fault-tolerance threshold in
   silicon
SO NATURE
AB Fault-tolerant quantum computers that can solve hard problems rely on quantum error correction(1). One of the most promising error correction codes is the surface code(2), which requires universal gate fidelities exceeding an error correction threshold of 99 per cent(3). Among the many qubit platforms, only superconducting circuits(4), trapped ions(5) and nitrogen-vacancy centres in diamond(6) have delivered this requirement. Electron spin qubits in silicon(7-15) are particularly promising for a large-scale quantum computer owing to their nanofabrication capability, but the two-qubit gate fidelity has been limited to 98 per cent owing to the slow operation(16). Here we demonstrate a two-qubit gate fidelity of 99.5 per cent, along with single-qubit gate fidelities of 99.8 per cent, in silicon spin qubits by fast electrical control using a micromagnet-induced gradient field and a tunable two-qubit coupling. We identify the qubit rotation speed and coupling strength where we robustly achieve high-fidelity gates. We realize Deutsch-Jozsa and Grover search algorithms with high success rates using our universal gate set. Our results demonstrate universal gate fidelity beyond the fault-tolerance threshold and may enable scalable silicon quantum computers.

TI Compressively strained epitaxial Ge layers for quantum computing
   applications
SO MATERIALS SCIENCE IN SEMICONDUCTOR PROCESSING
AB The epitaxial growth of a strained Ge layer, which is a promising candidate for the channel material of a hole spin qubit, has been demonstrated on 300 mm Si wafers using commercially available Si0.3Ge0.7 strain relaxed buffer (SRB) layers. The assessment of the layer and the interface qualities for a buried strained Ge layer embedded in Si0.3Ge0.7 layers is reported. The XRD reciprocal space mapping confirmed that the reduction of the growth temperature enables the 2-dimensional growth of the Ge layer fully strained with respect to the Si0.3Ge0.7. Nevertheless, dislocations at the top and/or bottom interface of the Ge layer were observed by means of electron channeling contrast imaging, suggesting the importance of the careful dislocation assessment. The interface abruptness does not depend on the selection of the precursor gases, but it is strongly influenced by the growth temperature which affects the coverage of the surface H-passivation. The mobility of 2.7 x 105 cm2/Vs is promising, while the low percolation density of 3 x 1010 /cm2 measured with a Hall-bar device at 7 K illustrates the high quality of the heterostructure thanks to the high Si0.3Ge0.7 SRB quality.

TI Conference key agreement in a quantum network
SO NPJ QUANTUM INFORMATION
AB Quantum conference key agreement (QCKA) allows multiple users to establish a secure key from a shared multi-partite entangled state. In a quantum network, this protocol can be efficiently implemented using a single copy of a N-qubit Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) state to distil a secure N-user conference key bit, whereas up to N-1 entanglement pairs are consumed in the traditional pair-wise protocol. We demonstrate the advantage provided by GHZ states in a testbed consisting of a photonic six-user quantum network, where four users can distil either a GHZ state or the required number of Bell pairs for QCKA using network routing techniques. In the asymptotic limit, we report a more than two-fold enhancement of the conference key rate when comparing the two protocols. We extrapolate our data set to show that the resource advantage for the GHZ protocol persists when taking into account finite-key effects.

AB A major difficulty in quantum simulation is the adequate treatment of a large collection of entangled particles, synonymous with electron correlation in electronic structure theory, with coupled cluster (CC) theory being the leading framework for dealing with this problem. Augmenting computationally affordable low-rank approximations in CC theory with a perturbative account of higher-rank excitations is a tractable and effective way of accounting for the missing electron correlation in those approximations. This is perhaps best exemplified by the "gold standard" CCSD(T) method, which bolsters the baseline CCSD with the effects of triple excitations using considerations from many-body perturbation theory (MBPT). Despite this established success, such a synergy between MBPT and the unitary analog of CC theory (UCC) has not been explored. In this work, we propose a similar approach wherein converged UCCSD amplitudes are leveraged to evaluate energy corrections associated with triple excitations, leading to the UCCSD[T] method. In terms of quantum computing, this correction represents an entirely classical post-processing step that improves the energy estimate by accounting for triple excitation effects without necessitating new quantum algorithm developments or increasing demand for quantum resources. The rationale behind this choice is shown to be rigorous by studying the properties of finite-order UCC energy functionals, and our efforts do not support the addition of the fifth-order contributions as in the (T) correction. We assess the performance of these approaches on a collection of small molecules and demonstrate the benefits of harnessing the inherent synergy between MBPT and UCC theories.

TI Formation of Tesseract Time Crystals on a Quantum Computer
SO CRYSTALS
AB The engineering of new states of matter through Floquet driving has revolutionized the field of condensed matter physics. This technique enables the creation of hybrid topological states and ordered phases that are absent in normal systems. Crystalline structures, exemplifying spatially ordered systems under periodic driving, have been extensively studied. However, recent focus has shifted towards discrete time crystals (DTCs), periodically driven quantum many-body systems that break time translation symmetry under specific conditions. In this paper, the model of discrete time crystals is extended to allow for the formation of time-varying tesseracts, allowing for the investigation of time translational symmetry in pseudo-higher-dimensional lattice systems.

TI Quantum Physics-Informed Neural Networks
SO ENTROPY
AB In this study, the PennyLane quantum device simulator was used to investigate quantum and hybrid, quantum/classical physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) for solutions to both transient and steady-state, 1D and 2D partial differential equations. The comparative expressibility of the purely quantum, hybrid and classical neural networks is discussed, and hybrid configurations are explored. The results show that (1) for some applications, quantum PINNs can obtain comparable accuracy with less neural network parameters than classical PINNs, and (2) adding quantum nodes in classical PINNs can increase model accuracy with less total network parameters for noiseless models.

AB Developing state-of-the-art classical simulators of quantum circuits is of utmost importance to test and evaluate early quantum technology and understand the true potential of full-blown error-corrected quantum computers. In the past few years, multiple theoretical and numerical advances have continuously pushed the boundary of what is classically simulable, hence the development of a plethora of tools which are often limited to a specific purpose or designed for a particular hardware (e.g. CPUs vs. GPUs). Moreover, such tools are typically developed using tailored languages and syntax, which makes it hard to compare results from, and create hybrid approaches using, different simulation techniques. To support unified and optimized use of these techniques across platforms, we developed HybridQ, a highly extensible platform designed to provide a common framework to integrate multiple state-of-the-art techniques to run on a variety of hardware. The philosophy behind its development has been driven by three main pillars: Easy to Use, Easy to Extend, and Use the Best Available Technology. The powerful tools of HybridQ allow users to manipulate, develop, and extend noiseless and noisy circuits for different hardware architectures. HybridQ supports large-scale high-performance computing (HPC) simulations, automatically balancing workload among different processor nodes and enabling the use of multiple backends to maximize parallel efficiency. Everything is then glued together by a simple and expressive language that allows seamless switching from one technique to another as well as from one hardware to the next, without the need to write lengthy translations, thus greatly simplifying the development of new hybrid algorithms and techniques.

TI Variational Quantum Algorithm-Preserving Feasible Space for Solving the
   Uncapacitated Facility Location Problem
SO ADVANCED QUANTUM TECHNOLOGIES
AB The Quantum Alternating Operator Ansatz (QAOA+) is one of the Variational Quantum Algorithm (VQA) specifically developed to tackle combinatorial optimization problems by exploring the feasible space in search of a target solution. For the Constrained Binary Optimization with Unconstrained Variables Problems (CBO-UVPs), the mixed operators in the QAOA+ circuit are applied to the constrained variables, while the single-qubit rotating gates operate on the unconstrained variables. The expressibility of this circuit is limited by the shortage of two-qubit gates and the parameter sharing in the single-qubit rotating gates, which consequently impacts the performance of QAOA+ for solving CBO-UVPs. Therefore, it is crucial to develop a suitable ansatz for CBO-UVPs. In this paper, the Variational Quantum Algorithm-Preserving Feasible Space (VQA-PFS) ansatz is proposed, exemplified by the Uncapacitated Facility Location Problem (UFLP), that applies mixed operators on constrained variables while employing Hardware-Efficient Ansatz (HEA) on unconstrained variables. The numerical results demonstrate that VQA-PFS significantly enhances the probability of success and exhibits faster convergence than QAOA+, Quantum Approximation Optimization Algorithm (QAOA), and HEA. Furthermore, VQA-PFS reduces the circuit depth dramatically compared to QAOA+ and QAOA. The algorithm is general and instructive in tackling CBO-UVPs.
   In this paper, the Variational Quantum Algorithm-Preserving Feasible Space (VQA-PFS) ansatz is proposed to solve Uncapacitated Facility Location Problem. The numerical results demonstrate that VQA-PFS has at least 54% higher success probability and requires only about 125 iterations to converge to the optimum compared to initial QAOA, Quantum Alternating Operator Ansatz, and Hardware-Efficient Ansatz. image

TI Optimized Design of the Lithium Niobate for Spectrally-Pure-State
   Generation at MIR Wavelengths Using Metaheuristic Algorithm
SO ADVANCED QUANTUM TECHNOLOGIES
AB Quantum light sources in the mid-infrared (MIR) band play an important role in many applications, such as quantum sensing, quantum imaging, and quantum communication. However, there is still a lack of high-quality quantum light sources in the MIR band, such as the spectrally pure single-photon source. In this work, the generation of a spectrally-pure state in an optimized poled lithium niobate crystal using a metaheuristic algorithm is presented. In particular, the particle swarm optimization algorithm is adopted to optimize the duty cycle of the poling period of the lithium niobate crystal. With this approach, the spectral purity can be improved from 0.820 to 0.998 under the third group-velocity-matched condition, and the wavelength-tunable range from 3.0 to 4.0 mu m for the degenerate case and 3.0 to 3.7 mu m for the nondegenerate case. This work paves the way for developing quantum photonic technologies at the MIR wavelength band.

TI Optimizing satellite and core networks for a global quantum network
SO JOURNAL OF OPTICAL COMMUNICATIONS AND NETWORKING
AB Quantum key distribution (QKD) promises information theoretic security. However, the exponential decay of the secure key in optical fibers leads to limitations in long distance QKD distribution across fibers, which is necessary for global quantum networks (QNs). Satellite QKD can be used to generate keys over long distances bypassing fiber limitations and is thus a promising approach for global QNs. In this paper, we construct mixed integer linear program (MILP) models to investigate how to best connect the core fiber network to ground stations to minimize the overall network cost. We design one MILP that can provide a quantitative value for the number of satellites needed for a given configuration and another one to optimize the allocation of the core network nodes to ground stations to minimize the overall network cost. We use these models to investigate different strategies to allocate satellites to ground stations during a satellite overpass, showing that allocating satellites based on the expected transmission requirements can reduce the number of satellites needed in a network by up to 40% compared to randomly allocating the satellites to ground stations. Furthermore, we use these models to investigate securing the data center traffic in two networks, one local European network and one global network, and show that costs in the optimal configuration can be up to 40% cheaper than simply connecting core network sites to their geographically closest ground station.

TI Quantum Algorithms for the Multiplication of Circulant Matrices and
   Vectors
SO INFORMATION
AB This article presents two quantum algorithms for computing the product of a circulant matrix and a vector. The arithmetic complexity of the first algorithm is O(Nlog2N) in most cases. For the second algorithm, when the entries in the circulant matrix and the vector take values in C or R, the complexity is O(Nlog2N) in most cases. However, when these entries take values from positive real numbers, the complexity is reduced to O(log3N) in most cases, which presents an exponential speedup compared to the classical complexity of O(NlogN) for computing the product of a circulant matrix and vector. We apply this algorithm to the convolution calculation in quantum convolutional neural networks, which effectively accelerates the computation of convolutions. Additionally, we present a concrete quantum circuit structure for quantum convolutional neural networks.

TI Broadband Coaxial S-Parameter Measurements for Cryogenic Quantum
   Technologies
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON MICROWAVE THEORY AND TECHNIQUES
AB Development of RF and microwave metrology capabilities at cryogenic temperatures is critical for the development of high-performance microwave devices to facilitate commercialization of cryogenic quantum technologies. This article presents a broadband microwave S-parameter calibration scheme suitable for cryogenic environments operating at temperatures down to tens of milli-kelvin (mK). The technique is based on a weighted multi-line thru-reflect-line (TRL) calibration approach and is demonstrated using coaxial air line calibration standards. One-and two-port microwave devices commonly used in cryogenic quantum computing applications, a cryogenic 50 Omega matched load and a cryogenic 6 dB attenuator, were measured. The measured results at mK temperatures indicate that when combined with calibration standards of appropriate electrical length, the weighted multi-line TRL calibration scheme allows broadband frequency coverage compared to conventional TRL calibration schemes utilizing a single line standard. The mechanical and electrical properties of the line standards at mK temperatures were investigated and discussed. These findings establish the feasibility of utilizing multiple off-the-shelf coaxial air lines to enhance the frequency range of calibrations at mK temperatures.

TI Spanning Tree Matching Decoder for Quantum Surface Codes
SO IEEE COMMUNICATIONS LETTERS
AB We introduce the spanning tree matching (STM) decoder for surface codes, which guarantees the error correction capability up to the code's designed distance by first employing an instance of the minimum spanning tree on a subset of ancilla qubits within the lattice. Then, a perfect matching graph is simply obtained, by selecting the edges more likely to be faulty. A comparative analysis reveals that the STM decoder, at the cost of a slight performance degradation, provides a substantial advantage in decoding time compared to the minimum weight perfect matching (MWPM) decoder. Finally, we propose an even more simplified and faster algorithm, the Rapid-Fire (RFire) decoder, designed for scenarios where decoding speed is a critical requirement.

TI Anyonic Two-Photon Statistics with a Semiconductor Chip
SO ACS PHOTONICS
AB Anyons, particles displaying a fractional exchange statistics intermediate between bosons and fermions, play a central role in the fractional quantum Hall effect and various spin-lattice models, and have been proposed for topological quantum computing schemes due to their resilience to noise. Here we use parametric down-conversion in an integrated semiconductor chip to generate biphoton states simulating anyonic particle statistics in a reconfigurable manner. Our scheme exploits the frequency entanglement of the photon pairs, which is directly controlled through the spatial shaping of the pump beam. These results, demonstrated at room temperature and telecom wavelength on a chip-integrated platform, pave the way to the practical implementation of quantum simulation tasks with tailored particle statistics.

TI Quantum decoherence and relaxation in long-baseline neutrino data
SO JOURNAL OF HIGH ENERGY PHYSICS
AB We investigate the effect of quantum decoherence and relaxation in neutrino oscillations using MINOS and T2K data. The formalism of open quantum systems is used to describe the interaction of a neutrino system with the environment, where the strength of the interaction is regulated by a decoherence parameter Gamma. We assume an energy dependence parameterized by Gamma = gamma(0)(E/GeV)(n), with n = -2, 0, +2, and consider three different scenarios, allowing the investigation of the effect of relaxation and of constraining the solar and atmospheric sectors to the same decoherence parameter. The MINOS and T2K data present a complementary behavior, with regard to our theoretical model, resulting in a better sensitivity for n = +2 and n = -2, respectively. We perform a combined analyses of both experimental data, which also include a reactor constraint on sin(2)theta(13), and observe an independence of the results to the scenarios we investigate. Our analyses obtain limits on gamma 0 based on long-baseline data for scenarios allowing or not relaxation. We improve some previous bounds on gamma 0 and outline which data (solar, reactor, atmospheric, long-baseline) determine the more stringent constraints for different scenarios and energy dependencies.

TI Deep-learning-based radio-frequency side-channel attack on quantum key
   distribution
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW APPLIED
AB Quantum key distribution (QKD) protocols have been proven to be secure on the basis of fundamental physical laws; however, the proofs consider a well-defined setting and encoding of the sent quantum signals only. Side channels, where the encoded quantum state is correlated with properties of other degrees of freedom of the quantum channel, allow an eavesdropper to obtain information unnoticeably, as demonstrated in a number of hacking attacks on the quantum channel. However, also classical radiation emitted by the devices may be correlated, leaking information on the potential key, especially when combined with novel data-analysis methods. We demonstrate here a side-channel attack using a deep convolutional neural network to analyze the recorded classical, radio-frequency electromagnetic emissions. Even at a distance of a few centimeters from the electronics of a QKD sender containing frequently used electronic components, we are able to recover virtually all information about the secret key. However, as shown here, countermeasures can enable a significant reduction of both the emissions and the amount of secretkey information leaked to the attacker. Our analysis methods are independent of the actual device and thus provide a starting point for assessing the presence of classical side channels in QKD devices.

TI Suppression of Crosstalk in Superconducting Qubits Using Dynamical
   Decoupling
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW APPLIED
AB Currently available superconducting quantum processors with interconnected transmon qubits are noisy and prone to various errors. The errors can be attributed to sources such as open quantum system effects and spurious interqubit couplings (crosstalk). Static ZZ coupling between qubits in transmon architectures is always present and contributes to both coherent and incoherent crosstalk errors. Its suppression is therefore a key step toward enhancing the fidelity of quantum computation using transmons. Here, we propose the use of dynamical decoupling to suppress the crosstalk and we demonstrate the success of this scheme through experiments performed on several IBM quantum cloud processors. In particular, we demonstrate improvements in quantum memory as well as the performance of single-qubit and two-qubit gate operations. We perform open quantum system simulations of the multiqubit processors and find good agreement with the experimental results. We analyze the performance of the protocol based on a simple analytical model and elucidate the importance of the qubit drive frequency in interpreting the results. In particular, we demonstrate that the XY4 dynamical decoupling sequence loses its universality if the drive frequency is not much larger than the system-bath coupling strength. Our work demonstrates that dynamical decoupling is an effective, practical, and scalable way to suppress crosstalk and open-system effects, thus paving the way toward higher-fidelity logic gates in transmon-based quantum computers.

TI DT-QFL: Dual-Timeline Quantum Federated Learning With Time-Symmetric
   Updates, Temporal Memory Kernels, and Reversed Gradient Dynamics
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON QUANTUM ENGINEERING
AB Federated learning has emerged as a powerful paradigm for decentralized model training, ensuring privacy preservation by allowing clients to collaboratively learn a shared model without exchanging raw data. Quantum federated learning (QFL) extends this approach by leveraging quantum computing to enhance computational efficiency and security. However, existing QFL frameworks face challenges in handling temporal inconsistencies and ensuring model robustness across time-evolving datasets. Recent findings in quantum physics suggest the emergence of two opposing arrows of time in quantum systems, indicating that time-reversal symmetry can be harnessed for computational processes. This work introduces dual-timeline quantum federated learning (DT-QFL), a novel framework that integrates time-reversal symmetry into QFL. DT-QFL employs quantum memory kernels to encode temporal correlations in client updates, ensuring that both past and future data distributions contribute to the learning process. In addition, we introduce a quantum temporal-invariant neural network, which enables federated models to learn patterns invariant to time flow, improving generalization and reducing catastrophic forgetting in decentralized environments.

Quantum machines, however, can simulate classical stochastic processes while storing significantly less information than their optimal classical counterparts. This implies qualitative divergences between classical and quantum statistical complexity. Here, we develop error-tolerant techniques to witness such divergences, enabling us to account for the inevitable imperfections in realising quantum stochastic simulators with present-day quantum technology. We apply these tools to experimentally verify the quantum memory advantage in simulating an Ising spin chain, even when accounting for experimental distortion. This then leads us to observe a recently conjectured effect, the ambiguity of simplicity-the notion that the relative complexity of two different processes can depend on whether we model the process using classical or quantum means of information processing.

TI Trapping of single atom and precise control of its coupling strength in
   micro-optical cavity
SO ACTA PHYSICA SINICA
AB Cavity quantum electrodynamic system with strongly coupled single atoms provides a good platform for studying quantum information processing, quantum simulation, quantum network, and distributed quantum computing. Cooling and trapping single atoms is a crucial technique in the quantum technology. At present, in a high-finesse cavity with finite space, cooling and trapping single atoms is a big challenge, even though it is a mature technique for free space. Great efforts have been made to cool and trap single atoms inside a cavity, and for a trapped atom its lifetime has reached as long as tens of seconds. Developing a more flexible method of cooling and trapping single atoms in a cavity is still essential for a strongly coupled cavity quantum electrodynamic system. In this work, we demonstrate experimentally that a single cesium atom in a cavity can be trapped by utilizing a single optical tweezer settled in cavity mode, and its lifetime is (2.60 & PLUSMN; 0.18) s. The experiment is carried out in a Fabry-Perot cavity, which is assembled by two concave mirrors each with a curvature radius of 100 mm, and cavity length of 335 & mu;m. The concave surfaces are highly reflective, and the cavity has a finesse of 6.1 x 104. The 1080 nm optical tweezer with a waist of 2 & mu;m is formed by an achromatic lens group with a numerical aperture of 0.4. At first, the precooled atomic assemble released from the magneto optical trap (MOT) is transferred into cavity mode by an optical dipole trap with a waist of 36 & mu;m. Then, one of the successfully transferred atoms is captured by the optical tweezer with the aid of cavity cooling mechanism. A blue detuned cavity locking laser is used as a standing-wave optical trap along the cavity axis. The signal of successfully trapped one atom is obtained by recording transmission of the cavity that will decrease owing to the strong coupling induced vacuum Rabi splitting. Finally, we demonstrate the precise manipulation of the atom-cavity coupling strength, which is achieved by scanning the position of the trapped atom step by step by using a high-precision translation stage. The system realized in this work can be used to study the dynamics of single atom-photon interactions with adjustable coupling strength. In addition, the mechanism adopted in this work is compatible with constructing tweezer arrays inside cavity mode, and thus possesses more flexibility and great potentials in cavity-based quantum entanglement and quantum simulation.

TI Novel Application of Quantum Computing for Routing and Spectrum
   Assignment in Flexi-Grid Optical Networks
SO PHOTONICS
AB Flexi-grid technology has revolutionized optical networking by enabling Elastic Optical Networks (EONs) that offer greater flexibility and dynamism compared to traditional fixed-grid systems. As data traffic continues to grow exponentially, the need for efficient and scalable solutions to the routing and spectrum assignment (RSA) problem in EONs becomes increasingly critical. The RSA problem, being NP-Hard, requires solutions that can simultaneously address both spatial routing and spectrum allocation. This paper proposes a novel quantum-based approach to solving the RSA problem. By formulating the problem as a Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) model, we employ the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) to effectively solve it. Our approach is specifically designed to minimize end-to-end delay while satisfying the continuity and contiguity constraints of frequency slots. Simulations conducted using the Qiskit framework and IBM-QASM simulator validate the effectiveness of our method. We applied the QAOA-based RSA approach to small network topology, where the number of nodes and frequency slots was constrained by the limited qubit count on current quantum simulator. In this small network, the algorithm successfully converged to an optimal solution in less than 30 iterations, with a total runtime of approximately 10.7 s with an accuracy of 78.8%. Additionally, we conducted a comparative analysis between QAOA, integer linear programming, and deep reinforcement learning methods to evaluate the performance of the quantum-based approach relative to classical techniques. This work lays the foundation for future exploration of quantum computing in solving large-scale RSA problems in EONs, with the prospect of achieving quantum advantage as quantum technology continues to advance.

TI Geometry of distributive multiparty entanglement in 4-qubit hypergraph
   states
SO IET QUANTUM COMMUNICATION
AB A detailed investigation of the multiparty entanglement present in the 4 - qubit quantum hypergraph states is presented, following a measurement-based geometrical approach. Considering a classification of the 4 - party quantum system represented by a mathematical hypergraph based on the connections between its vertices, the genuine 4 - party entanglement present in each bi-partition of the states have been measured. A strong correlation between the connectivity of the vertices of the hypergraphs and the genuine 4 - party entanglement has been found. The equivalence of the genuine 4 - party entanglement present in each bi-partition is shown considering similar connectivity of the vertices. This explicates the cyclic permutation symmetry of the multiparty entanglement present in the 4 - qubit hypergraph states. Physically, one may expect the quantum systems with superposition of many states to behave in this symmetric manner while mapped into a network-type picture, which the authors have quantified, as well as classified in this work.

TI A Novel Quantum Entanglement-Inspired Meta-heuristic Framework for
   Solving Multimodal Optimization Problems
SO CHINESE JOURNAL OF ELECTRONICS
AB To solve Multimodal optimization problems (MOPs), a Novel Quantum entanglement-inspired meta-heuristic framework (NMF-QE) is proposed. Its main inspirations are two concepts of quantum physics: quantum entanglement and quantum superposition. When given Proto-born particles (PBPs) of a population, these two concepts are mathematically developed to generate twin-born and combination-born particles, respectively. And if any elite-born particles would be created by a local re-searching strategy. These three or four groups of particles come together as a whole search population of NMF-QE to realize exploration and exploitation of algorithms. To guarantee dynamical optimization capability of NMF-QE, the individual evolutionary mechanism of some existing meta-heuristics will be adopted to iteratively create PBPs. A selected meta-heuristic is coupled with NMF-QE to present its improved variant. Numerical results show that the proposed NMF-QE can effectively improve optimization performance of meta-heuristics on MOPs.

The technique is based on the simultaneous occurrence of two spontaneous parametric down-conversion processes satisfying independent type-II collinear quasi-phase matching conditions in periodically poled stoichiometric lithium tantalate. The generated photon pairs exhibit non-degenerate Hong-Ou-Mandel interference, indicating the presence of quantum entanglement in the frequency domain. This method provides a light source capable of wide-range quantum sensing and quantum imaging or high-dimensional quantum processing.

TI Microwave quantum diode
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB The fragile nature of quantum circuits is a major bottleneck to scalable quantum applications. Operating at cryogenic temperatures, quantum circuits are highly vulnerable to amplifier backaction and external noise. Non-reciprocal microwave devices such as circulators and isolators are used for this purpose. These devices have a considerable footprint in cryostats, limiting the scalability of quantum circuits. As a proof-of-concept, here we report a compact microwave diode architecture, which exploits the non-linearity of a superconducting flux qubit. At the qubit degeneracy point we experimentally demonstrate a significant difference between the power levels transmitted in opposite directions. The observations align with the proposed theoretical model. At - 99 dBm input power, and near the qubit-resonator avoided crossing region, we report the transmission rectification ratio exceeding 90% for a 50 MHz wide frequency range from 6.81 GHz to 6.86 GHz, and over 60% for the 250 MHz range from 6.67 GHz to 6.91 GHz. The presented architecture is compact, and easily scalable towards multiple readout channels, potentially opening up diverse opportunities in quantum information, microwave read-out and optomechanics.
   Quantum devices exhibiting non-reciprocal behaviour have been attracting attention for fundamental studies and applications. Here the authors report a microwave quantum diode based on a superconducting flux qubit coupled to two resonators, which has the advantage of compactness and scalability.

TI Enhancing variational quantum state diagonalization using reinforcement
   learning techniques
SO NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB The variational quantum algorithms are crucial for the application of NISQ computers. Such algorithms require short quantum circuits, which are more amenable to implementation on near-term hardware, and many such methods have been developed. One of particular interest is the so-called variational quantum state diagonalization method, which constitutes an important algorithmic subroutine and can be used directly to work with data encoded in quantum states. In particular, it can be applied to discern the features of quantum states, such as entanglement properties of a system, or in quantum machine learning algorithms. In this work, we tackle the problem of designing a very shallow quantum circuit, required in the quantum state diagonalization task, by utilizing reinforcement learning (RL). We use a novel encoding method for the RL-state, a dense reward function, and an epsilon-greedy policy to achieve this. We demonstrate that the circuits proposed by the RL methods are shallower than the standard variational quantum state diagonalization algorithm and thus can be used in situations where hardware capabilities limit the depth of quantum circuits. The methods we propose in the paper can be readily adapted to address a wide range of variational quantum algorithms.

SO CHINESE OPTICS LETTERS
AB We demonstrate a high-performance acousto-optic modulator-based bi-frequency interferometer, which can realize either beating or beating free interference for a single-photon level quantum state. Visibility and optical efficiency of the interferometer are (99.5 +/- 0.2)% and (95 +/- 1)%, respectively. The phase of the interferometer is actively stabilized by using a dithering phase-locking scheme, where the phase dithering is realized by directly driving the acousto-optic modulators with a specially designed electronic signal. We further demonstrate applications of the interferometer in quantum technology, including bi-frequency coherent combination, frequency tuning, and optical switching. These results show the interferometer is a versatile device for multiple quantum technologies.

TI Quantum algorithms for hedging and the learning of Ising models
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB A paradigmatic algorithm for online learning is the Hedge algorithm by Freund and Schapire. An allocation into different strategies is chosen for multiple rounds and each round incurs corresponding losses for each strategy. The algorithm obtains a favorable guarantee for the total losses even in an adversarial situation. This work presents quantum algorithms for such online learning in an oracular setting. For T time steps and N strategies, we exhibit run times of about O(poly(T)root N) for estimating the losses and for betting on individual strategies by sampling. In addition, we discuss a quantum analog of the Sparsitron, a machine learning algorithm based on the Hedge algorithm. The quantum algorithm inherits the provable learning guarantees from the classical algorithm and exhibits polynomial speedups. The speedups may find relevance in finance, for example, for hedging risks, and machine learning, for example, for learning generalized linear models or Ising models.

TI Stabilizing Remote Entanglement via Waveguide Dissipation
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB Distributing entanglement between remote sites is integral to quantum networks. Here, we demonstrate the autonomous stabilization of remote entanglement between a pair of noninteracting superconducting qubits connected by an open waveguide on a chip. In this setting, the interplay between a classical continuous drive-supplied through the waveguide-and dissipation into the waveguide stabilizes the qubit pair in a dark state, which, asymptotically, takes the form of a Bell state. We use field-quadrature measurements of the photons emitted to the waveguide to perform quantum state tomography on the stabilized states, where we find a concurrence of 0.504(-0.029)(+0.007) in the optimal setting with a stabilization time constant of 56 +/- 4 ns. We examine the imperfections within our system and discuss avenues for enhancing fidelities and achieving scalability in future work. The decoherence-protected steady-state remote entanglement offered via dissipative stabilization may find applications in distributed quantum computing, sensing, and communication.

TI Multi-Armed Bandits and Quantum Channel Oracles
SO QUANTUM
AB Multi-armed bandits are one of the theoretical pillars of reinforcement learning. Recently, the investigation of quantum algorithms for multi-armed bandit problems was started, and it was found that a quadratic speedup (in query complexity) is possible when the arms and the randomness of the rewards of the arms can be queried in superposition. Here we introduce further bandit models where we only have limited access to the randomness of the rewards, but we can still query the arms in superposition. We show that then the query complexity is the same as for classical algorithms. This generalizes the prior result that no speedup is possible for unstructured search when the oracle has positive failure probability.

TI Quantum Circuit Designs of Integer Division Optimizing T-count and
   T-depth
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON EMERGING TOPICS IN COMPUTING
AB Quantum circuits for mathematical functions such as division are necessary to use quantum computers for scientific computing. Quantum circuits based on Clifford+T gates can easily be made fault-tolerant but the T gate is very costly to implement. The small number of qubits available in existing quantum computers adds another constraint on quantum circuits. As a result, reducing T-count and qubit cost have become important optimization goals. The design of quantum circuits for integer division has caught the attention of researchers and designs have been proposed in the literature. However, these designs suffer from excessive T gate and qubit costs. Many of these designs also produce significant garbage output resulting in additional qubit and T gate costs to eliminate these outputs. In this work, we propose two quantum integer division circuits. The first proposed quantum integer division circuit is based on the restoring division algorithm and the second proposed design implements the non-restoring division algorithm. Both proposed designs are optimized in terms of T-count, T-depth and qubits. Both proposed quantum circuit designs are based on (i) a quantum subtractor, (ii) a quantum adder-subtractor circuit, and (iii) a novel quantum conditional addition circuit. Our proposed restoring division circuit achieves average T-count savings from 79.03 to 91.69 percent compared to the existing works. Our proposed non-restoring division circuit achieves average T-count savings from 49.22 to 90.03 percent compared to the existing works. Further, both our proposed designs have linear T-depth. We also illustrate the application of the proposed quantum division circuits in quantum image processing with a case study of quantum bilinear interpolation.

Polarization modulation plays an essential role for polarization encoding quantum key distribution (QKD). Polarization is used to encode photons in the QKD systems. In this work, visible -range polarizers with optimal dimensions based on resonance grating waveguides have been numerically designed and investigated using the COMSOL Multiphysics Software. Two structures have been designed, namely a single-layer metasurface grating (SLMG) polarizer and an interlayer metasurface grating (ILMG) polarizer. Both structures have demonstrated high extinction ratios, similar to 1.8 center dot 10(3) and 8.68 center dot 10(4), and the bandwidths equal to 45 and 55 nm for the SLMG and ILMG, respectively.

Quantum computers provide an interesting platform for such experimental investigation of QD, fulfiling their initial intended purpose as quantum simulators. Here we assess to what degree current Noisy intermediate-scale quantum devices can be used as experimental platforms in the field of QD. We do this by simulating an exactly solvable stochastic collision model, taking advantage of the analytical solution to benchmark the experimental results.

AB From correlations in measurement outcomes alone, can two otherwise isolated parties establish whether such correlations are atemporal? That is, can they rule out that they have been given the same system at two different times? Classical statistics says no, yet quantum theory disagrees. Here, we introduce the necessary and sufficient conditions by which such quantum correlations can be identified as atemporal. We demonstrate the asymmetry of atemporality under time reversal and reveal it to be a measure of spatial quantum correlation distinct from entanglement. Our results indicate that certain quantum correlations possess an intrinsic arrow of time and enable classification of general quantum correlations across spacetime based on their (in)compatibility with various underlying causal structures.

TI All-optical superconducting qubit readout
SO NATURE PHYSICS
AB The rapid development of superconducting quantum hardware is expected to run into substantial restrictions on scalability because error correction in a cryogenic environment has stringent input-output requirements. Classical data centres rely on fibre-optic interconnects to remove similar networking bottlenecks. In the same spirit, ultracold electro-optic links have been proposed and used to generate qubit control signals, or to replace cryogenic readout electronics. So far, these approaches have suffered from either low efficiency, low bandwidth or additional noise. Here we realize radio-over-fibre qubit readout at millikelvin temperatures. We use one device to simultaneously perform upconversion and downconversion between microwave and optical frequencies and so do not require any active or passive cryogenic microwave equipment. We demonstrate all-optical single-shot readout in a circulator-free readout scheme. Importantly, we do not observe any direct radiation impact on the qubit state, despite the absence of shielding elements. This compatibility between superconducting circuits and telecom-wavelength light is not only a prerequisite to establish modular quantum networks, but it is also relevant for multiplexed readout of superconducting photon detectors and classical superconducting logic.

TI First Request First Service Entanglement Routing Scheme for Quantum
   Networks
SO ENTROPY
AB Quantum networks enable many applications beyond the reach of classical networks by supporting the establishment of long-distance entanglement connections, and are already stepped into the entanglement distribution network stage. The entanglement routing with active wavelength multiplexing schemes is urgently required for satisfying the dynamic connection demands of paired users in large-scale quantum networks. In this article, the entanglement distribution network is modeled into a directed graph, where the internal connection loss among all ports within a node is considered for each supported wavelength channel, which is quite different to classical network graphs. Afterwards, we propose a novel first request first service (FRFS) entanglement routing scheme, which performs the modified Dijkstra algorithm to find out the lowest loss path from the entangled photon source to each paired user in order. Evaluation results show that the proposed FRFS entanglement routing scheme can be applied to large-scale and dynamic topology quantum networks.

TI Measurement-based multipartite entanglement inflation
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Generating entanglement between more parties is one of the central tasks and challenges in the backdrop of building quantum technologies. Here we propose a measurement-based protocol for producing multipartite entangled states which can be later fed into some network for realizing suitable quantum protocols. We consider weak entangling measurement on two parties as the basic unit of operation to create entanglement between more parties starting from an entangled state with a lesser number of parties and auxiliary systems in the form of a single-qubit or entangled state itself. We call the introduced expansion procedure, "multipartite entanglement inflation." In the context of inflating bipartite entanglement to more number of parties, surprisingly, maximally entangled states as inputs turn out to be worse than that of the nonmaximally entangled states, Haar uniformly generated pure states having a moderate amount of entanglement and the Werner state with a certain threshold noise. We also report that the average multipartite entanglement created from the initial Greenberger-HorneZeilinger- and the W-class states are almost the same. Interestingly, we also observe that for Haar uniformly generated pure states, unentangled auxiliary systems are sometimes more advantageous than the protocol with multiple copies of the initial entangled states.

TI Quantum algorithm for bioinformatics to compute the similarity between
   proteins
SO IET QUANTUM COMMUNICATION
AB Drug discovery has become a main challenge in the society, following the COVID-19 pandemic. However, pharmaceutical companies are already using computing to accelerate drug discovery and are increasingly interested in quantum computing (QC), with a view to improving the speed of development process for new drugs. The authors propose a quantum method for generating random sequences based on occurrence in a protein database and quantum algorithms for calculating a similarity rate between proteins. Both concepts can be used for structure prediction in drug design. The aim is to find the proteins closest to the generated protein and obtain an ordering of these proteins. First, the authors will present the construction of a quantum protein generator that defines a protein, called a test protein. The authors will then describe different methods to compute the similarity's rate between each protein in the database and the test protein or, for a case study, the elafin. The algorithms have been extended or adapted to a quantum formalism for use cases, that is, amino acid sequences, and tested to see the added value of quantum versions. The interest is to observe whether QC can be used in the drug discovery process.

TI Single Photon Avalanche Diode Arrays for Quantum Imaging and Microscopy
SO ADVANCED QUANTUM TECHNOLOGIES
AB Quantum imaging and microscopy profit from quantum correlations and entanglement to image objects and samples with resolution and sensitivity that goes far beyond what can be achieved through classical optics. In order to carry out these techniques, suitable detectors with specific features must be employed. This paper aims to highlight the importance of sensors based on single photon avalanche diodes (SPAD) in quantum imaging and microscopy applications, paving the way for the next-generation ideal quantum imager. After reviewing the main techniques (based on quantum physics principles) for improving the resolution and sensitivity of a sample image, the pros and cons of different sensors, such as avalanche photodiodes (APDs), and the intensified and electron-multiplying charge coupled devices (ICCDs and EMCCDs), are identified. Then the analysis mainly focuses on SPAD-based detectors, identified as the best candidates for quantum imaging, critically discussing the requirements and performance, also in relation to already existing SPAD-based architectures with specific features fitting the application. Eventually, next-generation quantum imagers should integrate together all the best architectural choices herewith presented, so as to detect photon coincidences and to perform efficient event-driven readout, also by exploiting a suitable technology and SPAD design to optimize the discussed detection performance.

TI Gate-based quantum computing for protein design
SO PLOS COMPUTATIONAL BIOLOGY
AB Protein design is a technique to engineer proteins by permuting amino acids in the sequence to obtain novel functionalities. However, exploring all possible combinations of amino acids is generally impossible due to the exponential growth of possibilities with the number of designable sites. The present work introduces circuits implementing a pure quantum approach, Grover's algorithm, to solve protein design problems. Our algorithms can adjust to implement any custom pair-wise energy tables and protein structure models. Moreover, the algorithm's oracle is designed to consist of only adder functions. Quantum computer simulators validate the practicality of our circuits, containing up to 234 qubits. However, a smaller circuit is implemented on real quantum devices. Our results show that using O(vN) iterations, the circuits find the correct results among all N possibilities, providing the expected quadratic speed up of Grover's algorithm over classical methods (i.e., O(N)).

TI Linear embedding of nonlinear dynamical systems and prospects for
   efficient quantum algorithms
SO PHYSICS OF PLASMAS
AB The simulation of large nonlinear dynamical systems, including systems generated by discretization of hyperbolic partial differential equations, can be computationally demanding. Such systems are important in both fluid and kinetic computational plasma physics. This motivates exploring whether a future error-corrected quantum computer could perform these simulations more efficiently than any classical computer. We describe a method for mapping any finite nonlinear dynamical system to an infinite linear dynamical system (embedding) and detail three specific cases of this method that correspond to previously studied mappings. Then we explore an approach for approximating the resulting infinite linear system with finite linear systems (truncation). Using a number of qubits only logarithmic in the number of variables of the nonlinear system, a quantum computer could simulate truncated systems to approximate output quantities if the nonlinearity is sufficiently weak. Other aspects of the computational efficiency of the three detailed embedding strategies are also discussed.

TI Machine learning of reduced quantum channels on noisy intermediate-scale
   quantum devices
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Worldwide efforts aim at the realization of advanced quantum simulators and processors. However, despite the development of intricate hardware and pulse control systems, it may still not be generally known which effective quantum dynamics, or channels, are implemented on these devices. To systematically infer those, we propose a neural-network algorithm approximating generic discrete-time dynamics through the repeated action of an effective quantum channel. We test our approach considering time-periodic Lindblad dynamics as well as nonunitary subsystem dynamics in many-body unitary circuits. Moreover, we exploit it to investigate cross-talk effects on the ibmq_ehningen quantum processor, which showcases our method as a practically applicable tool for inferring quantum channels when the exact nature of the underlying dynamics on the physical device is not known a priori. While the present approach is tailored for learning Markovian dynamics, we discuss how it can be adapted to also capture generic non-Markovian discrete-time evolutions.

Specifically, we focus on the dynamics after a quantum quench of the Renyi entropies, mutual information, and entanglement negativity in the prototypical XXZ spin chain with random bonds and anisotropy parameters. We provide analytic predictions in the scaling regime based on real-space renormalization-group methods. We support these findings through numerical simulations in the noninteracting limit, where we can access the scaling regime.

TI Robust single-qubit gates by composite pulses in three-level systems
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Composite pulses are an efficient tool for robust quantum control. In this work, we derive the form of the composite pulse sequence to implement robust single-qubit gates in a three-level system, where two low-energy levels act as a qubit. The composite pulses can efficiently cancel the systematic errors up to a certain order. We find that the three-pulse sequence cannot completely eliminate the first order of systematic errors, but still availably makes the fidelity resistant to variations in a specific direction. When employing more pulses in the sequence (N > 3), the fidelity can be insensitive to the variations in all directions and the robustness region becomes much wider. Finally we demonstrate the applications of composite pulses in quantum information processing, e.g., robust quantum information transfer between two qubits.

TI Quantum algorithm for the linear Vlasov equation with collisions
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB The Vlasov equation is a nonlinear partial differential equation that provides a first-principles description of the dynamics of plasmas. Its linear limit is routinely used in plasma physics to investigate plasma oscillations , stability. In this paper, we present a quantum algorithm that simulates the linearized Vlasov equation with and without collisions, in the one-dimensional electrostatic limit. Rather than solving this equation in its native spatial and velocity phase space, we adopt an efficient representation in the dual space yielded by a Fourier-Hermite expansion. For a given simulation time, the Fourier-Hermite representation is exponentially more compact, thus yielding a classical algorithm that can match the performance of a previously proposed quantum algorithm for this problem. This representation results in a system of linear ordinary differential equations (ODEs) which can be solved with well-developed quantum algorithms: a Hamiltonian simulation in the collisionless case , quantum ODE solvers in the collisional case. In particular, we demonstrate that a quadratic speedup in system size is attainable.

TI Equivalence between Fermion-to-Qubit Mappings in two Spatial Dimensions
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB We argue that all locality-preserving mappings between fermionic observables and Pauli matrices on a two-dimensional lattice can be generated from the exact bosonization in Chen et al. [Ann. Phys. (N. Y) 393, 234 (2018)], whose gauge constraints project onto the subspace of the toric code with emergent fermions. Starting from the exact bosonization and applying Clifford finite-depth generalized local unitary transformation, we can achieve all possible fermion-to-qubit mappings (up to the re-pairing of Majorana fermions). In particular, we discover a new supercompact encoding using 1.25 qubits per fermion on the square lattice. We prove the existence of finite-depth quantum circuits to obtain fermion-to-qubit mappings with qubit-fermion ratios r = 1 + 1/2k for positive integers k, utilizing the trivialness of quantum cellular automata in two spatial dimensions. Also, we provide direct constructions of fermion-to-qubit mappings with ratios arbitrarily close to 1. When the ratio reaches 1, the fermion-to-qubit mapping reduces to the one-dimensional Jordan-Wigner transformation along a certain path in the two-dimensional lattice. Finally, we explicitly demonstrate that the Bravyi-Kitaev superfast simulation, the Verstraete-Cirac auxiliary method, Kitaev's exactly solved model, the Majorana loop stabilizer codes, and the compact fermion-to-qubit mapping can all be obtained from the exact bosonization.

TI A simplified Mølmer-Sørensen gate for the trapped ion quantum computer
SO PHYSICA SCRIPTA
AB We discuss how to simplify the Molmer-Sorensen (MS) gate which is used for the trapped ion quantum computer. The original MS gate is implemented by illuminating two ions with bichromatic coherent light fields separately at the same time. In this paper, we propose a method for transforming a separable state of two ions into one of the Bell states by illuminating the two ions with monochromatic coherent light fields individually and this point is the advantage of our scheme over the original MS gate. The length of the execution time of our proposed gate is comparable to that of the original MS gate, however, numerical calculations show that our proposed gate is weakly sensitive to thermal fluctuations of the phonons. By giving another example of a simple two-ion gate that can generate entanglement but is strongly vulnerable to thermal fluctuations, we show that our simplified MS gate is more marked than usual.

TI Demonstration of quantum projective simulation on a single-photon-based
   quantum computer
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Variational quantum algorithms show potential in effectively operating on noisy intermediate-scale quantum devices. A variational approach to reinforcement learning has been recently proposed, incorporating linear-optical interferometers and a classical learning model known as projective simulation (PS). PS is a decision-making tool for reinforcement learning and can be classically represented as a random walk on a graph that describes the agent's memory. In its optical quantum version, this approach utilizes quantum walks of single photons on a mesh of tunable beamsplitters and phase shifters to select actions. In this work, we present the implementation of this algorithm on Ascella, a single-photon-based quantum computer from Quandela. The focus is drawn on solving a test bed task to showcase the potential of the quantum agent with respect to the classical agent.

TI A quantum sensor for atomic-scale electric and magnetic fields
SO NATURE NANOTECHNOLOGY
AB The detection of faint magnetic fields from single-electron and nuclear spins at the atomic scale is a long-standing challenge in physics. While current mobile quantum sensors achieve single-electron spin sensitivity, atomic spatial resolution remains elusive for existing techniques. Here we fabricate a single-molecule quantum sensor at the apex of the metallic tip of a scanning tunnelling microscope by attaching Fe atoms and a PTCDA (3,4,9,10-perylenetetracarboxylic-dianhydride) molecule to the tip apex. We address the molecular spin by electron spin resonance and achieve similar to 100 neV resolution in energy. In a proof-of-principle experiment, we measure the magnetic and electric dipole fields emanating from a single Fe atom and an Ag dimer on an Ag(111) surface with sub-angstrom spatial resolution. Our method enables atomic-scale quantum sensing experiments of electric and magnetic fields on conducting surfaces and may find applications in the sensing of spin-labelled biomolecules and of spin textures in quantum materials.

TI Classical correspondence of quantum entanglement in mesoscopic circuit
SO ACTA PHYSICA SINICA
AB Since the birth of quantum mechanics, its classical correspondence (or analogy) has been a hot topic for physicists. In this paper, we first discuss whether there is a classical correspondence of quantum entanglement. We give a positive answer through the following examples: in the framework of quantization of mesoscopic circuits, two mesoscopic capacitance inductance (LC) circuits with mutual inductance are proved to be the source of quantum entanglement by using the integration within an ordered product, and then the formula of their characteristic frequency is obtained, It is found that it is similar to the expression of the small oscillating frequency of a classical system described below. The classical system is shown in Fig. 1. Two walls are connected with the same spring. And between the two springs a sliding trolley can move on a smooth table. The trolley is hung with a simple pendulum, The small oscillating frequency of the system is calculated by analytical mechanics. It is found that the swing of the simple pendulum will cause the trolley to oscillate back and forth. The mutual restraint effect of the pendulum, the trolley and the spring reflects the "entanglement" between them.

TI Propagating quantum microwaves: towards applications in communication
   and sensing
SO QUANTUM SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB The field of propagating quantum microwaves is a relatively new area of research that is receiving increased attention due to its promising technological applications, both in communication and sensing. While formally similar to quantum optics, some key elements required by the aim of having a controllable quantum microwave interface are still on an early stage of development. Here, we argue where and why a fully operative toolbox for propagating quantum microwaves will be needed, pointing to novel directions of research along the way: from microwave quantum key distribution to quantum radar, bath-system learning, or direct dark matter detection. The article therefore functions both as a review of the state-of-the-art, and as an illustration of the wide reach of applications the future of quantum microwaves will open.

TI Essay: Emergent Holographic Spacetime from Quantum Information
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB Holographic duality describes gravitational theories in terms of quantum many-body systems. In holography, quantum information theory provides a crucial tool that directly connects microscopic structures of these systems to the geometries of gravitational spacetimes. One manifestation is that the entanglement entropy in quantum many-body systems can be calculated from the area of an extremal surface in the corresponding gravitational spacetime. This implies that a gravitational spacetime can emerge from an enormous number of entangled qubits. In this Essay, I will discuss open problems in this area of research, considering recent developments and outlining future prospects towards a complete understanding of quantum gravity. The first step in this direction is to understand what kind of quantum circuits each holographic spacetime corresponds to, drawing on recent developments in quantum complexity theories and studying concrete examples of holography in string theory. Next, we should extend the concept of holography to general spacetimes, e.g., those spacetimes which appear in realistic cosmologies, by utilizing the connections between quantum information and holography. To address the fundamental question of how time emerges, I will propose the concepts of pseudoentropy and timelike entanglement as a useful tool in our exploration.

TI GHz-pulsed source of entangled photons for reconfigurable quantum
   networks
SO QUANTUM SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB Entanglement is a universal resource in quantum networks, yet entangled photon sources are typically custom-made for a specific use case. Versatility, both in terms of state modulation and tunability of the temporal properties of the photons, is the key to flexible network architectures and cryptographic primitives that go beyond quantum key distribution. Here, we report on a flexible source design that produces high-quality entanglement in continuous-wave and GHz-rate-pulsed operation modes. Utilizing off-the-shelf optical components, our approach uses a fiber-based Sagnac loop to generate polarization-entangled photons at telecom wavelength with high efficiency and fidelities above 0.99. Phase modulation up to GHz before entangled state generation is also possible for fast entangled state switching. We show phase modulation at 100 MHz with an average fidelity of 0.95. Furthermore, the source 60 nm spectral bandwidth is entirely compatible with fully reconfigurable wavelength-multiplexed quantum networks.

TI Surface code for low-density qubit array
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB Surface code is a promising candidate for the quantum error corrections needed for fault-tolerant quantum computations because it can operate on a two-dimensional grid of qubits. However, the gates and control lines become dense as more and more qubits are integrated, making their design and control difficult. This problem can be alleviated if the surface code can operate on sparse qubit arrays. Here, we give an solution for an array in which qubits are placed on edges as well as on nodes of a two-dimensional grid. The qubits on the edges are divided into two groups: those in one group act as the deputies of data qubits; the others act as deputies of the syndrome qubits. Syndrome outputs are obtained by multiplying the measured values of the syndrome and edge qubits. The procedure for the quantum part is the same as that of the ordinary surface code, making the surface code applicable to sparse qubit arrays.

TI Holographic Quantum Simulation of Entanglement Renormalization Circuits
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB While standard approaches to quantum simulation require a number of qubits proportional to the number of simulated particles, current noisy quantum computers are limited to tens of qubits. With the technique of holographic quantum simulation, a D-dimensional system can be simulated with a (D - 1)-dimensional subset of qubits, enabling the study of systems significantly larger than current quantum computers. Using circuits derived from the multiscale entanglement renormalization ansatz (MERA), we accurately prepare the ground state of an L = 32 critical, nonintegrable perturbed Ising model and measure long-range correlations on the ten-qubit Quantinuum trapped-ion computer. We introduce generalized MERA networks that interpolate between MERA and matrix product state networks and demonstrate that generalized MERA can capture far longer correlations than a MERA with the same number of qubits, at the expense of greater circuit depth. Finally, we perform noisy simulations of these two network ansatzes and find that the optimal choice of network depends on the noise level, available qubits, and the state to be represented.

TI Equivalence of cost concentration and gradient vanishing for quantum
   circuits: an elementary proof in the Riemannian formulation
SO QUANTUM SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB The optimization of quantum circuits can be hampered by a decay of average gradient amplitudes with increasing system size. When the decay is exponential, this is called the barren plateau problem. Considering explicit circuit parametrizations (in terms of rotation angles), it has been shown in Arrasmith et al (2022 Quantum Sci. Technol. 7 045015) that barren plateaus are equivalent to an exponential decay of the variance of cost-function differences. We show that the issue is particularly simple in the (parametrization-free) Riemannian formulation of such optimization problems and obtain a tighter bound for the cost-function variance. An elementary derivation shows that the single-gate variance of the cost function is strictly equal to half the variance of the Riemannian single-gate gradient, where we sample variable gates according to the uniform Haar measure. The total variances of the cost function and its gradient are then both bounded from above by the sum of single-gate variances and, conversely, bound single-gate variances from above. So, decays of gradients and cost-function variations go hand in hand, and barren plateau problems cannot be resolved by avoiding gradient-based in favor of gradient-free optimization methods.

TI Spin qudit tomography and state reconstruction error
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB We consider the task of performing quantum state tomography on a d-level spin qudit, using only measurements of spin projection onto different quantization axes. After introducing a basis of operators closely related to the spherical harmonics, which obey the rotational symmetries of spin qudits, we map our quantum tomography task onto the classical problem of signal recovery on the sphere. We then provide algorithms with O(rd3) serial runtime, parallelizable down to O(rd2) for: (i) computing a priori upper bounds on the expected error with which spin projection measurements along r given axes can reconstruct an unknown qudit state, and (ii) estimating a posteriori the statistical error in a reconstructed state. Our algorithms motivate a simple randomized tomography protocol for which we find that using more measurement axes can yield substantial benefits that plateau after r approximate to 3d.

TI Quantum entanglement with generalized uncertainty principle
SO NUCLEAR PHYSICS B
AB We explore how the quantum entanglement is modified in the generalized uncertainty principle (GUP)-corrected quantum mechanics by introducing the coupled harmonic oscillator system. Constructing the ground state rho(0) and its reduced substate rho(A) = Tr-B rho 0, we compute two entanglement measures of rho(0), i.e. E-EoF(rho(0)) = S-von(rho(A)) and E-gamma (rho(0)) = S-gamma(rho(A)), where S-von and S-gamma are the von Neumann and Renyi entropies, up to the first order of the GUP parameter alpha. It is shown that E gamma (rho 0) increases with increasing alpha when gamma = 2, 3, middot middot middot. The remarkable fact is that E-EoF (rho(0)) does not have first-order of alpha. Based on there results we conjecture that E-gamma (rho(0)) increases or decreases with increasing alpha when gamma > 1 or gamma < 1 respectively for nonnegative real gamma. (C) 2022 The Author.

TI QDataSet, quantum datasets for machine learning
SO SCIENTIFIC DATA
AB The availability of large-scale datasets on which to train, benchmark and test algorithms has been central to the rapid development of machine learning as a discipline. Despite considerable advancements, the field of quantum machine learning has thus far lacked a set of comprehensive large-scale datasets upon which to benchmark the development of algorithms for use in applied and theoretical quantum settings. In this paper, we introduce such a dataset, the QDataSet, a quantum dataset designed specifically to facilitate the training and development of quantum machine learning algorithms. The QDataSet comprises 52 high-quality publicly available datasets derived from simulations of one- and two-qubit systems evolving in the presence and/or absence of noise. The datasets are structured to provide a wealth of information to enable machine learning practitioners to use the QDataSet to solve problems in applied quantum computation, such as quantum control, quantum spectroscopy and tomography. Accompanying the datasets on the associated GitHub repository are a set of workbooks demonstrating the use of the QDataSet in a range of optimisation contexts.

TI Reconfigurable photonics with on-chip single-photon detectors
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Integrated quantum photonics offers a promising path to scale up quantum optics experiments by miniaturizing and stabilizing complex laboratory setups. Central elements of quantum integrated photonics are quantum emitters, memories, detectors, and reconfigurable photonic circuits. In particular, integrated detectors not only offer optical readout but, when interfaced with reconfigurable circuits, allow feedback and adaptive control, crucial for deterministic quantum teleportation, training of neural networks, and stabilization of complex circuits. However, the heat generated by thermally reconfigurable photonics is incompatible with heat-sensitive superconducting single-photon detectors, and thus their on-chip co-integration remains elusive. Here we show low-power microelectromechanical reconfiguration of integrated photonic circuits interfaced with superconducting single-photon detectors on the same chip. We demonstrate three key functionalities for photonic quantum technologies: 28 dB high-extinction routing of classical and quantum light, 90 dB high-dynamic range single-photon detection, and stabilization of optical excitation over 12 dB power variation. Our platform enables heat-load free reconfigurable linear optics and adaptive control, critical for quantum state preparation and quantum logic in large-scale quantum photonics applications. Integrated photonics are promising to scale up quantum optics. Here the authors combine low-power microelectromechanical control and superconducting single-photon detectors on the same chip and demonstrate routing, high-dynamic-range detection, and power stabilization.

AB The imminent emergence of quantum computers poses unprecedented challenges to the current cryptographic standards that secure vital digital communications and data worldwide. This paper addresses the vulnerabilities of existing cryptographic systems susceptible to quantum-based attacks and emphasizes a dedicated transition plan to post-quantum cryptography (PQC). We first examine the current state of cryptographic practices, highlight the quantum threat, and present the framework and need for PQC. In addition, a comprehensive strategy is presented that encompasses the identification, protection, detection, response, and recovery phases and integrates PQC into existing security infrastructures, specifically the Cybersecurity Framework Version 2.0 of the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). Methods and technologies discussed include the development of robust PQC algorithms, tools for their large-scale implementation, and hybrid cryptographic systems that combine traditional and quantum-resistant techniques. Practical implementations on various hardware and software platforms are also presented in case studies that provide real-world insight into the challenges and innovations in using PQC. We conclude with a discussion of hybrid approaches, regulatory considerations, and recommendations derived from early adopters to guide future efforts to create a quantum-resilient digital landscape.

Unlike previous work, the point addition operation is implemented exactly, including all exceptional cases. We provide exact logical gate and qubit counts of our algorithm for cryptographically relevant binary field sizes. Furthermore, we estimate the hardware footprint and runtime of our algorithm executed on surface-code matter-based quantum computers with a baseline architecture, where logical qubits have nearest-neighbor connectivity, and on a surface-code photonic fusion-based quantum computer with an active-volume architecture, which enjoys a logarithmic number of nonlocal connections between logical qubits. At 10% threshold and compared to a baseline device with a 1-mu s code cycle, our algorithm runs greater than or similar to 2-20 times faster, depending on the operating regime of the hardware and over all considered field sizes, on a photonic active-volume device.

TI Security of quantum key distribution from generalised entropy
   accumulation
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB The goal of quantum key distribution (QKD) is to establish a secure key between two parties connected by an insecure quantum channel. To use a QKD protocol in practice, one has to prove that a finite size key is secure against general attacks: no matter the adversary's attack, they cannot gain useful information about the key. A much simpler task is to prove security against collective attacks, where the adversary is assumed to behave identically and independently in each round. In this work, we provide a formal framework for general QKD protocols and show that for any protocol that can be expressed in this framework, security against general attacks reduces to security against collective attacks, which in turn reduces to a numerical computation. Our proof relies on a recently developed information-theoretic tool called generalised entropy accumulation and can handle generic prepare-and-measure protocols directly without switching to an entanglement-based version.

TI Quantum Information Spreading in Generalized Dual-Unitary Circuits
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB We study the spreading of quantum information in a recently introduced family of brickwork quantum circuits that generalizes the dual-unitary class. These circuits are unitary in time, while their spatial dynamics is unitary only in a restricted subspace. First, we show that local operators spread at the speed of light as in dual-unitary circuits, i.e., the butterfly velocity takes the maximal value allowed by the geometry of the circuit. Then, we prove that the entanglement spreading can still be characterized exactly for a family of compatible initial states (in fact, for an extension of the compatible family of dual-unitary circuits) and that the asymptotic entanglement slope is again independent on the Re<acute accent>nyi index. Remarkably, however, we find that the entanglement velocity is generically smaller than 1. We use these properties to find a closedform expression for the entanglement-membrane line tension.

TI Demonstration of Quantum Energy Teleportation on Superconducting Quantum
   Hardware
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW APPLIED
AB Teleporting physical quantities to remote locations remains a key challenge for quantum informa-tion science and technology. Quantum teleportation has enabled the transfer of quantum information, but teleportation of quantum physical quantities has not yet been realized. Here we report the realiza-tion and observation of quantum energy teleportation on real superconducting quantum hardware. We achieve this by using several IBM superconducting quantum computers. The results are consistent with the exact solution of the theory and are improved by the mitigation of measurement error. Quantum energy teleportation requires only local operations and classical communication. Therefore, our results provide a realistic benchmark that is fully achievable with current quantum computing and communication technologies.

TI Emergence of global receptive fields capturing multipartite quantum
   correlations
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
AB In quantum physics, even simple data with a well-defined structure at the wave-function level can be characterized by extremely complex correlations between its constituent elements. The inherent nonlocality of the quantum correlations generally prevents one from providing their simple and transparent interpretation, which also remains a challenging problem for advanced classical techniques that approximate quantum states with neural networks. Here we show that monitoring the neural network weight space while learning quantum statistics from measurements allows us to develop physical intuition about complex multipartite patterns and thus helps to construct more effective classical representations of the wave functions. In particular, we observe the formation of distinct global convolutional structures, receptive fields in the hidden layer of the restricted Boltzmann machine within the neural quantum tomography of the highly entangled Dicke states. On this basis we propose an exact two-parameter classical representation not only for a specific quantum wave function, but for the whole family of N-qubit Dicke states of different entanglement. Our findings suggest a fresh look at constructing convolutional neural networks for processing data with nonlocal patterns and may pave the way for developing exact learning-based representations of entangled quantum states.

TI Toward a Quantum Computing Formulation of the Electron Nuclear Dynamics
   Method via Fukutome Unitary Representation
SO SYMMETRY-BASEL
AB We present the first step toward the quantum computing (QC) formulation of the electron nuclear dynamics (END) method within the variational quantum simulator (VQS) scheme: END/QC/VQS. END is a time-dependent, variational, on-the-flight, and non-adiabatic method to simulate chemical reactions. END represents nuclei with frozen Gaussian wave packets and electrons with a single-determinantal state in the Thouless non-unitary representation. Within the hybrid quantum/classical VQS, END/QC/VQS currently evaluates the metric matrix M and gradient vector V of the symplectic END/QC equations on the QC software development kit QISKIT, and calculates basis function integrals and time evolution on a classical computer. To adapt END to QC, we substitute the Thouless non-unitary representation with Fukutome unitary representation. We derive the first END/QC/VQS version for pure electronic dynamics in multielectron chemical models consisting of two-electron units with fixed nuclei. Therein, Fukutome unitary matrices factorize into triads of one-qubit rotational matrices, which leads to a QC encoding of one electron per qubit. We design QC circuits to evaluate M and V in one-electron diatomic molecules. In log2-log2 plots, errors and deviations of those evaluations decrease linearly with the number of shots and with slopes = -1/2. We illustrate an END/QC/VQS simulation with the pure electronic dynamics of H2+ We discuss the present results and future END/QC/QVS extensions.

TI Quantum coherence, correlations and nonclassical states in the two-qubit
   Rabi model with parametric oscillator
SO PHYSICA A-STATISTICAL MECHANICS AND ITS APPLICATIONS
AB Quantum coherence and quantum correlations are studied in the strongly interacting system composed of two qubits and an oscillator with the presence of a parametric medium. To analytically solve the system, we employ the adiabatic approximation approach. It assumes each qubit's characteristic frequency is substantially lower than the oscillator frequency. To validate our approximation, a good agreement between the calculated energy spectrum of the Hamiltonian with its numerical result is presented. The time evolution of the reduced density matrices of the two-qubit and the oscillator subsystems are computed from the tripartite initial state. Starting with a factorized two-qubit initial state, the quasi-periodicity in the revival and collapse phenomenon that occurs in the two-qubit population inversion is studied. Based on the measure of relative entropy of coherence, we investigate the quantum coherence and its explicit dependence on the parametric term both for the two-qubit and the individual qubit subsystems by adopting different choices of the initial states. Similarly, the existence of quantum correlations is demonstrated by studying the geometric discord and concurrence. Besides, by numerically minimizing the Hilbert-Schmidt distance, the dynamically produced near maximally entangled states are reconstructed. The reconstructed states are observed to be nearly pure generalized Bell states. Furthermore, utilizing the oscillator density matrix, the quadrature variance and phase-space distribution of the associated Husimi Q-function are computed in the minimum entropy regime and conclude that the obtained nearly pure evolved state is a squeezed coherent state.

TI Energy Risk Analysis With Dynamic Amplitude Estimation and Piecewise
   Approximate Quantum Compiling
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON QUANTUM ENGINEERING
AB In this article, we generalize the approximate quantum compiling algorithm into a new method for cnot-depth reduction, which is apt to process wide target quantum circuits. Combining this method with state-of-the-art techniques for error mitigation and circuit compiling, we present a ten-qubit experimental demonstration of iterative amplitude estimation on a quantum computer. The target application is a derivation of the expected value of contract portfolios in the energy industry. In parallel, we also introduce a new variant of the quantum amplitude estimation algorithm, which we call dynamic amplitude estimation, as it is based on the dynamic circuit capability of quantum devices. The algorithm achieves a reduction in the circuit width in the order of the binary precision compared to the typical implementation of quantum amplitude estimation, while simultaneously decreasing the number of quantum-classical iterations (again in the order of the binary precision) compared to the iterative amplitude estimation. The calculation of the expected value, value at risk, and conditional value at risk of contract portfolios on quantum hardware provides a proof of principle of the new algorithm.

TI Controlled quantum state transfer in XX spin chains at the
   Quantum Speed Limit
SO PHYSICS LETTERS A
AB The Quantum Speed Limit (QSL) can be found in many different situations, in particular in the propagation of information through quantum spin chains. In homogeneous chains it implies that taking information from one extreme of the chain to the other will take a time O (N/2), where N is the chain length. Using Optimal Control Theory we design control pulses that achieve near perfect population transfer between the extremes of the chain at times on the order of N/2. Our results show that the control pulses that govern the dynamical behavior of chains with different lengths are closely related. The pulses were constructed for control schemes involving one or two actuators in chains with exchange couplings without static disorder. Our results also show that the two actuator scheme is considerably more robust against the presence of static disorder than the scheme that uses just a single one. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V.

TI Equivalence of Three Classical Algorithms With Quantum Side Information:
   Privacy Amplification, Error Correction, and Data Compression
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INFORMATION THEORY
AB Privacy amplification (PA) is an indispensable component in classical and quantum cryptography. Error correction (EC) and data compression (DC) algorithms are also indispensable in classical and quantum information theory. We here study these three algorithms (PA, EC, and DC) in the presence of quantum side information, and show that they all become equivalent in the one-shot scenario. As an application of this equivalence, we take previously known security bounds of PA, and translate them into coding theorems for EC and DC which have not been obtained previously. Further, we apply these results to simplify and improve our previous result that the two prevalent approaches to the security proof of quantum key distribution (QKD) are equivalent. We also propose a new method to simplify the security proof of QKD.

We formulate a fault -tolerant measurement -based realization of this computational scheme on the lattice using ground states of the Walker -Wang model for the 3-fermion anyon theory with symmetry defects. The Walker -Wang measurement -based topological quantum computation paradigm that we introduce provides a general construction of computational resource states with thermally stable symmetry -protected topological order. We also demonstrate how symmetry defects of the 3-fermion anyon theory can be realized in a two-dimensional subsystem code due to Bombin-making contact with an alternative implementation of the 3-fermion defect -computation scheme via code deformations.

TI Quantum capacity analysis of multi-level amplitude damping channels
SO COMMUNICATIONS PHYSICS
AB Evaluating capacities of quantum channels is the first purpose of quantum Shannon theory, but in most cases the task proves to be very hard. Here, we introduce the set of Multi-level Amplitude Damping quantum channels as a generalization of the standard qubit Amplitude Damping Channel to quantum systems of finite dimension d. In the special case of d=3, by exploiting degradability, data-processing inequalities, and channel isomorphism, we compute the associated quantum and private classical capacities for a rather wide class of maps, extending the set of models whose capacity can be computed known so far. We proceed then to the evaluation of the entanglement assisted quantum and classical capacities. Estimating the capacity of quantum channels is relevant to understand at which rate quantum information can be exchanged. Here, the authors introduce multi-level amplitude damping channels that generalize the qubit amplitude damping noise model, analyse their quantum and private capacities, and exactly derive the capacities of quantum channels that are not anti-degradable.

Here we demonstrate a superconducting circuit test bed with bidirectional multiphoton state transfer capability using time -domain shaped wave packets.

We transfer both individual and superposition Fock states between the two remote nodes, and additionally show that this bidirectional state transfer can be done simultaneously, as well as being used to entangle elements in the two nodes.

TI Physical Realization of Measurement Based Quantum Computation
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB Quantum computers, leveraging the principles of quantum mechanics, hold the potential to surpass classical computers in numerous applications, with implications across various domains. Besides the well-known gate model, Measurement-based Quantum Computation (MBQC) is another promising computational approach to achieve universal quantum computation. In MBQC, large ensembles of qubits are prepared in a highly entangled cluster state, forming the basis for executing quantum computations through sequential measurements. Cluster states are realized using both continuous variables (CV) and discrete variables (DV) techniques. In the CV-based methods, Frequency Domain Multiplexing (FDM), Time Domain Multiplexing (TDM), Spatial Domain Multiplexing (SDM), and hybrid schemes are employed. This paper thoroughly discusses and compares these approaches, elucidating their strengths and limitations. Additionally, the generation of photonic cluster states in DV is explored and some recent results are reported. Some recent state-of-the-art advancements in photonic and superconducting qubits entanglement, which can potentially serve as cluster states, are also presented. Finally, we highlight the approach that exhibits the most promising characteristics for achieving efficient cluster state realization in the context of MBQC.

TI Complete structural restoring of transferred multi-qubit quantum state
SO PHYSICS LETTERS A
AB In this work, we study optimal transfer of quantum states via spin chains. We develop the protocol for structural restoring of multi-quantum coherence matrices of multi-qubit quantum states transferred from sender to receiver along a spin-1/2 chain. We also develop a protocol for constructing such 0-order coherence matrix that can be perfectly transferred in this process. The restoring protocol is based on the specially constructed unitary transformation applied to the state of the extended receiver. This transformation for a given length of the chain and Hamiltonian is universally optimal in the sense that ones constructed it can be applied to optimally restore any higher-order coherence matrices.

TI Accelerated Gaussian quantum state transfer between two remote
   mechanical resonators
SO NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB The main challenge in deterministic quantum state transfer (QST) between remote mechanical resonators is the local decoherence and the transmission losses in the communication channel. In the path of overcoming this limitation, here we employ a shortcut to adiabatic passage protocol to devise a fast and reliable evolution path between two remote mechanical modes in separate optomechanical systems (OMSs). A QST between the two nodes is conceived by engineering their coupling to an intermediate fiber optical channel. The coupling pulses are operated such that the dark eigenmode of the system is decoupled from the fiber modes and transitions to the bright modes are compensated for by counterdiabatic drives. We show that one obtains a QST with high fidelity for various Gaussian states. The efficiency is compared to that of adiabatic passage (AP) protocol in the presence of losses and noises. Our results show that while the AP protocol is very sensitive to the decoherence, the shortcut to adiabaticity provides a robust and fast QST even for small values of the coupling strength. The performance of both protocols are also investigated for the case of multimode fiber through numerical and an effective single-model model which is found by the elimination of off-resonant fiber modes. Our findings may pave the way for using OMSs in the realization of continuous-variable Gaussian QST.

TI Enhancing quantum adversarial robustness by randomized encodings
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB The interplay between quantum physics and machine learning gives rise to the emergent frontier of quantum machine learning, where advanced quantum learning models may outperform their classical counterparts in solving certain challenging problems. However, quantum learning systems are vulnerable to adversarial attacks: adding tiny carefully crafted perturbations on legitimate input samples can cause misclassifications. To address this problem, we propose an effective approach to protect quantum learning systems from adversarial attacks by randomly encoding the legitimate data samples through unitary or quantum error correction encoders that are unknown to the attackers. In particular, we rigorously prove that both global and local random unitary encoders lead to exponentially vanishing gradients (i.e., barren plateaus) for any variational quantum circuits that aim to add adversarial perturbations, independent of the input data and the inner structures of adversarial circuits and quantum classifiers. In addition, we prove a rigorous bound on the vulnerability of quantum classifiers under local unitary adversarial attacks. We show that random black-box quantum error correction encoders can protect quantum classifiers against local adversarial noises and their robustness increases as we concatenate error correction codes. To quantify the robustness enhancement, we adapt quantum differential privacy as a measure of the prediction stability for quantum classifiers. Our results establish versatile defense strategies for quantum classifiers against adversarial perturbations, which provide valuable guidance to enhance the reliability and security for both near-term and future quantum learning technologies.

TI Quantum contingency analysis for power system steady-state security
   identification
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB Unprecedented extreme climate events cause devastating infrastructure outages within power systems. Comprehensive outage identification is essential for the identification of critical components to ensure the uninterrupted power supply in a secure manner to withstand extreme weather events. Accurate outage identification, however, requires simulations of a large number of outage scenarios necessitating highly scalable computations thus challenging classical computing paradigms. Quantum computing provides a promising resolution by exploiting exponential scalability achieved through superposition and entanglement of voltage states. This paper devises a quantum contingency analysis (QCA) method to identify outage scenarios on Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) devices. Advanced quantum circuits incorporating Pauli-twirling, dynamic decoupling, and matrix-free measurement are designed to mitigate hardware-induced errors. A preconditioned hybrid method is devised to alleviate the computation burden of parameter optimization of quantum gates. Case studies identify line and generation outages via QCA in typical power systems. Our research underscores that quantum computing exhibits exponential scalability in identifying power grid outages and critical components.

TI Distributed quantum neural networks via partitioned features encoding
SO QUANTUM MACHINE INTELLIGENCE
AB Quantum neural networks are expected to be a promising application in near-term quantum computing, but face challenges such as vanishing gradients during optimization and limited expressibility by a limited number of qubits and shallow circuits. To mitigate these challenges, an approach using distributed quantum neural networks has been proposed to make a prediction by approximating outputs of a large circuit using multiple small circuits. However, the approximation of a large circuit requires an exponential number of small circuit evaluations. Here, we instead propose to distribute partitioned features over multiple small quantum neural networks and use the ensemble of their expectation values to generate predictions. To verify our distributed approach, we demonstrate ten class classification of the Semeion and MNIST handwritten digit datasets. The results of the Semeion dataset imply that while our distributed approach may outperform a single quantum neural network in classification performance, excessive partitioning reduces performance. Nevertheless, for the MNIST dataset, we succeeded in ten class classification with exceeding 96% accuracy. Our proposed method not only achieved highly accurate predictions for a large dataset but also reduced the hardware requirements for each quantum neural network compared to a large single quantum neural network. Our results highlight distributed quantum neural networks as a promising direction for practical quantum machine learning algorithms compatible with near-term quantum devices. We hope that our approach is useful for exploring quantum machine learning applications.

TI Improving nonstoquastic quantum annealing with spin-reversal
   transformations
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Nonstoquastic Hamiltonians are hard to simulate due to the sign problem in quantum Monte Carlo simulation. It is, however, unclear whether nonstoquasticity can lead to advantage in quantum annealing. Here we show that YY interactions between the qubits make the adiabatic path during quantum annealing, and therefore the performance, dependent on spin-reversal transformations. With the right choice of spin-reversal transformation, a nonstoquastic Hamiltonian with YY interaction can outperform stoquastic Hamiltonians with similar parameters. We introduce an optimization protocol to determine the optimal transformation and discuss the effect of suboptimality.

TI Maximum relative entropy of coherence for quantum channels
SO SCIENCE CHINA-PHYSICS MECHANICS & ASTRONOMY
AB Based on the resource theory for quantifying the coherence of quantum channels, we introduce a new coherence quantifier for quantum channels via maximum relative entropy. We prove that the maximum relative entropy for coherence of quantum channels is directly related to the maximally coherent channels under a particular class of superoperations, which results in an operational interpretation of the maximum relative entropy for coherence of quantum channels. We also introduce the conception of sub-superchannels and sub-superchannel discrimination. For any quantum channels, we show that the advantage of quantum channels in sub-superchannel discrimination can be exactly characterized by the maximum relative entropy of coherence for quantum channels. Similar to the maximum relative entropy of coherence for channels, the robustness of coherence for quantum channels has also been investigated. We show that the maximum relative entropy of coherence for channels provides new operational interpretations of robustness of coherence for quantum channels and illustrates the equivalence of the dephasing-covariant superchannels, incoherent superchannels, and strictly incoherent superchannels in these two operational tasks.

TI Tripartite Quantum Steering Based on Single-Pass Cascaded
   Double-Frequency Process
SO ACTA OPTICA SINICA
AB Objective Quantum steering, akin to quantum entanglement, serves as a fundamental resource in quantum information processing. However, quantum steering exhibits distinctive characteristics that set it apart from quantum entanglement, particularly through its asymmetric properties. In a bipartite quantum system, measurements performed on one subsystem can asymmetrically influence the state of the other subsystem. This asymmetry, not present in quantum entanglement, enables quantum steering to perform tasks beyond the capabilities of quantum entanglement, such as one-way quantum computing. In this computing paradigm, the asymmetric nature of quantum steering facilitates the implementation of computational processes where information flow and qubit manipulation follow a unidirectional pattern. This directionality is essential for specific quantum algorithms that depend on sequential operations and information propagation. Multipartite quantum steering with different frequencies presents numerous advantages. The distinct frequencies function as natural markers, enabling component separation. Through frequency-based separation, individual components of the multipartite quantum steering system can be isolated and manipulated independently. This capability proves particularly valuable in meeting the diverse requirements of quantum information processing, especially in quantum networks. These networks, designed to connect multiple quantum nodes, require precise control and interaction of quantum states. The frequency-based separation of multipartite quantum steering provides enhanced management of quantum information flow and states within the network, improving its overall performance. This paper presents a carefully designed and practical scheme for generating tripartite quantum steering with different frequencies. The proposed experimental setup combines simplicity with feasibility, aiming to advance the application of quantum steering in quantum information. Methods Starting from the nonlinear interactions, we obtain the interaction Hamiltonian of the system. Then, in the positive-P representation, we derive the stochastic differential equations of motion for the light field. Subsequently, by using the linearization method, we acquire the equations of motion for the light-field fluctuations. Through numerical integration, we solve for the expressions of the light-field fluctuations. According to the determination method of multipartite quantum steering, we theoretically prove the existence of genuine tripartite quantum steering among the fundamental, the second-, and the fourth-harmonic. Moreover, we discuss the relationships between the tripartite quantum steering, the nonlinear coupling coefficients, and the length of the nonlinear interaction. This provides reference data for obtaining stable tripartite quantum steering. Results and Discussions With the increase in the length xi of the nonlinear interaction, the tripartite quantum steering decreases. This indicates that although an increase in the length xi of the nonlinear interaction can improve the nonlinear conversion efficiency, an excessively large xi will also consume too much pump light and second-harmonic light. As a result, stable tripartite quantum steering cannot be obtained either (Fig. 3). When the length of the nonlinear interaction remains constant, the calculated value of the tripartite quantum steering increases as the ratio of the nonlinear coupling coefficients ic1/ic0 grows.
   Conversely, the quantum steering correlation decreases with the increase in the ratio of the nonlinear coupling coefficients ic1/ic0 (Fig. 4). A relatively large nonlinear coupling coefficient ic1 for the second-harmonic generation enhances the conversion efficiency of the fourth-harmonic. However, when ic1 is too large, the second-harmonic will be completely converted into the fourth-harmonic through the sum-frequency process and be depleted. In this case, tripartite quantum steering becomes impossible. Therefore, the nonlinear coupling coefficient ic1 must remain within appropriate limits. Conclusions In this study, we propose a feasible scheme for generating tripartite quantum steering using a single pass cascaded frequency doubling process. According to the criterion of multipartite quantum steering correlation, theoretical analysis demonstrates genuine tripartite quantum steering among the fundamental, second harmonic, and fourth harmonic optical fields. Additionally, we examined the influence of nonlinear coupling coefficients on tripartite quantum steering. The findings indicate that stable tripartite quantum steering requires maintaining the ratio of nonlinear coupling coefficient ic1/ic0 and the length of nonlinear interactions within specific bounds. Optimal tripartite quantum steering occurs when the three light fields maintain equal intensities. This scheme requires only an optical superlattice and pump light to generate a three-color quantum steering light field with a frequency difference of twice, eliminating the need for a resonant cavity. The research provides practical solutions and reference data for experimental preparation of quantum steering light fields at three different frequencies, potentially advancing quantum steering applications in quantum information science.

AB Quantum Computing (QC) has been a focus of research for many researchers over the last few years. As a result of technological development, QC resources are also becoming available and usable to solve practical problems in the Information Retrieval (IR) and Recommender Systems (RS) fields. Nowadays IR and RS need to perform complex operations on very large datasets. In this scenario, it could be possible to increase the performance of these systems both in terms of efficiency and effectiveness by employing QC and, especially, Quantum Annealing (QA). The goal of this work is to design a Lab composed of different Shared Tasks that aims to:
   - compare the performance of QA approaches with respect to their counterparts using traditional hardware;
   - identify new ways of formulating problems so that they can be solved with quantum annealers;
   - allow researchers from to different fields (e.g., Information Retrieval, Operations Research...) to work together and learn more about QA technologies.
   This Lab uses the QC resources provided by CINECA, one of the most important computing centers worldwide, thanks to an already met agreement. In addition, we also show a possible implementation of the required infrastructure which uses Docker containers and the Kubernetes orchestrator to ensure scalability, fault tolerance and that can be deployed on the cloud.

TI Scanning X-Ray Diffraction Microscopy for Diamond Quantum Sensing
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW APPLIED
AB An understanding of nano- and microscale crystal strain in chemical-vapor-deposition diamond is crucial to the advancement of diamond quantum technologies. In particular, the presence of such strain and its characterization presents a challenge to diamond-based quantum sensing and information applications-as well as for future dark-matter detectors, where the directional information about incoming particles is encoded in crystal strain. Here, we exploit nanofocused scanning x-ray diffraction microscopy to quantitatively measure crystal deformation from defects in diamond with high spatial and strain resolution. The combination of information from multiple Bragg angles allows stereoscopic three-dimensional modeling of strain-feature geometry; the diffraction results are validated via comparison to optical measurements of the strain tensor based on spin-state-dependent spectroscopy of ensembles of nitrogen-vacancy centers in the diamond. Our results demonstrate both strain and spatial resolution sufficient for directional detection of dark matter via x-ray measurement of crystal strain and provide a promising tool for diamond growth analysis and improvement of defect-based sensing.

TI Angle-robust two-qubit gates in a linear ion crystal
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB In trapped-ion quantum computers, two-qubit entangling gates are generated by applying spin-dependent force which uses phonons to mediate interaction between the internal states of the ions. To maintain high-fidelity two-qubit gates under fluctuating experimental parameters, robust pulse-design methods are applied to remove the residual spin-motion entanglement in the presence of motional mode-frequency drifts. Here we propose an improved pulse-design method that also guarantees the robustness of the two-qubit rotation angle against uniform mode-frequency drifts by concatenating pulses with opposite sensitivity of the angle to mode-frequency drifts. We experimentally verify significantly improved robustness of the rotation angle against uniform modefrequency drifts, as well as observe an improvement in gate fidelity from 97.84(10)% to 98.11(11)%, compared to a single frequency-modulated pulse.

TI High-fidelity remote entanglement of trapped atoms mediated by time-bin

SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Photonic interconnects between quantum processing nodes are likely the only way to achieve large-scale quantum computers and networks. The bottleneck in such an architecture is the interface between well-isolated quantum memories and flying photons. We establish high-fidelity entanglement between remotely separated trapped atomic qubit memories, mediated by photonic qubits stored in the timing of their pulses. Such time-bin encoding removes sensitivity to polarization errors, enables long-distance quantum communication, and is extensible to quantum memories with more than two states. Using a measurement-based error detection process and suppressing a fundamental source of error due to atomic recoil, we achieve an entanglement fidelity of 97% and show that fundamental limits due to atomic recoil still allow fidelities in excess of 99.9%.

TI Distributionally Robust Variational Quantum Algorithms With Shifted
   Noise
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON QUANTUM ENGINEERING
AB Given their potential to demonstrate near-term quantum advantage, variational quantum algorithms (VQAs) have been extensively studied. Although numerous techniques have been developed for VQA parameter optimization, it remains a significant challenge. A practical issue is that quantum noise is highly unstable and thus it is likely to shift in real time. This presents a critical problem as an optimized VQA ansatz may not perform effectively under a different noise environment. For the first time, we explore how to optimize VQA parameters to be robust against unknown shifted noise. We model the noise level as a random variable with an unknown probability density function (PDF), and we assume that the PDF may shift within an uncertainty set. This assumption guides us to formulate a distributionally robust optimization problem, with the goal of finding parameters that maintain effectiveness under shifted noise. We utilize a distributionally robust Bayesian optimization solver for our proposed formulation. This provides numerical evidence in both the quantum approximate optimization algorithm and the variational quantum eigensolver with hardware-efficient ansatz, indicating that we can identify parameters that perform more robustly under shifted noise. We regard this work as the first step toward improving the reliability of VQAs influenced by shifted noise from the parameter optimization perspective.

TI Quantum visual feature encoding revisited
SO QUANTUM MACHINE INTELLIGENCE
AB Although quantum machine learning has been introduced for a while, its applications in computer vision are still limited. This paper, therefore, revisits the quantum visual encoding strategies, the initial step in quantum machine learning. Investigating the root cause, we uncover that the existing quantum encoding design fails to ensure information preservation of the visual features after the encoding process, thus complicating the learning process of the quantum machine learning models. In particular, the problem, termed the "Quantum Information Gap" (QIG), leads to an information gap between classical and corresponding quantum features. We provide theoretical proof and practical examples with visualization for that found and underscore the significance of QIG, as it directly impacts the performance of quantum machine learning algorithms. To tackle this challenge, we introduce a simple but efficient new loss function named Quantum Information Preserving (QIP) to minimize this gap, resulting in enhanced performance of quantum machine learning algorithms. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of our approach, showcasing superior performance compared to current methodologies and consistently achieving state-of-the-art results in quantum modeling.

TI Generalizing the quantum information model for dynamic diffraction
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB The development of novel neutron optics devices that rely on perfect crystals and nanoscale features are ushering in a new generation of neutron science experiments, from fundamental physics to material characterization of emerging quantum materials. However, the standard theory of dynamical diffraction (DD) that analyzes neutron propagation through perfect crystals does not consider complex geometries, deformations, and/or imperfections, which are now becoming a relevant systematic effect in high-precision interferometric experiments. In this work, we expand upon a quantum information (QI) model of DD that is based on propagating a particle through a lattice of unitary quantum gates. We show that the model output is mathematically equivalent to the spherical wave solution of the Takagi-Taupin equations when in the appropriate limit, and that the model can be extended to the Bragg as well as the Laue-Bragg geometry where it is consistent with experimental data. The presented results demonstrate the universality of the QI model and its potential for modeling scenarios that are beyond the scope of the standard theory of DD.

TI Self-Tuning Transmitter for Quantum Key Distribution Using Machine
   Intelligence
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW APPLIED
AB The development and performance of quantum technologies heavily relies on the properties of the quantum states, which often require careful optimization of the driving conditions of all underlying com-ponents. In quantum key distribution (QKD), optical injection locking (OIL) of pulsed lasers has recently been shown as a promising technique to realize high-speed quantum transmitters with efficient system design. However, due to the complex underlying laser dynamics, tuning such laser system is both a chal-lenging and time-consuming task. Here, we experimentally demonstrate an OIL-based QKD transmitter that can be automatically tuned to its optimum operating state by employing a genetic algorithm. Starting with minimal knowledge of the laser operating parameters, the phase coherence and the quantum bit error rate of the system are optimized autonomously to a level matching the state of the art.

TI Microwave Gaussian Quantum Sensing With a CNOT Gate Receiver
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB In quantum illumination (QI) the non-classical correlations between continuous variable (CV) entangled modes of radiation are exploited to detect the presence of a target embedded in thermal noise. The extreme environment where QI outperforms its optimal classical counterpart suggests that applications in the microwave domain would benefit the most from this new sensing paradigm. However all the proposed QI receivers rely on ideal photon counters or detectors, which are not currently feasible in the microwave domain. Here we propose a new QI receiver that utilises a CV controlled not gate (CNOT) in order to perform a joint measurement on a target return and its retained twin. Unlike other QI receivers, the entire detection process is carried out by homodyne measurements and square-law detectors. The receiver exploits two squeezed ancillary modes as a part of the gate's operation. These extra resources are prepared offline and their overall gain is controlled passively by a single beamsplitter parameter. We compare our model to other QI receivers and highlight the conditions in which it outperforms others and achieves optimal performance. Although the main focus of this study is microwave quantum sensing applications, our proposed device can be built as well in the optical domain, thus rendering it as a new addition to the quantum sensing toolbox in a wider sense.

TI Probing spin-electric transitions in a molecular exchange qubit
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Electric fields represent an ideal means for controlling spins at the nanoscale and, more specifically, for manipulating protected degrees of freedom in multispin systems. Here we perform low-temperature magnetic far-IR spectroscopy on a molecular spin triangle (Fe3) and provide initial experimental evidence suggesting spin-electric transitions in polynuclear complexes. The co-presence of electric- and magnetic-dipole transitions, allows us to estimate the spin-electric coupling. Based on spin Hamiltonian simulations of the spectra, we identify the observed transitions and introduce the concept of a generalized exchange qubit. This applies to a wide class of molecular spin triangles, and includes the scalar chirality and the partial spin sum qubits as special cases.

TI Optimization two-qubit quantum gate by two optical control methods in
   molecular pendular states
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB Implementation of quantum gates are important for quantum computations in physical system made of polar molecules. We investigate the feasibility of implementing gates based on pendular states of the molecular system by two different quantum optical control methods. Firstly, the Multi-Target optimal control theory and the Multi-Constraint optimal control theory are described for optimizing control fields and accomplish the optimization of quantum gates. Numerical results show that the controlled NOT gate (CNOT) can be realized under the control of above methods with high fidelities (0.975 and 0.999) respectively. In addition, in order to examine the dependence of the fidelity on energy difference in the same molecular system, the SWAP gate in the molecular system is also optimized with high fidelity (0.999) by the Multi-Constraint optimal control theory with the zero-area and constant-fluence constraints.

TI Wide temperature operation of diamond quantum sensor for electric
   vehicle battery monitoring
SO DIAMOND AND RELATED MATERIALS
AB Considering the rising popularity of electric vehicles (EVs), it is essential to enhance the cruising mileage and extend the lifetime of batteries. To accomplish this, accurate monitoring of the charge and discharge current of the battery over a wide temperature range is essential. We developed a compact diamond quantum sensor head with a size of 1 x 1 x 0.5 cm3, consisting of a (111) high-pressure and high-temperature synthesized diamond with nitrogen-vacancy centers, by electron beam irradiation, which was adhered to the top of the multimode fiber and surrounded by the microwave antenna, for EV battery monitoring. We demonstrated that our quantum sensor achieved the current measurement accuracy of 10 mA in the-150 to 150 degrees C temperature range with a bandwidth of 500 Hz under atmospheric pressure and confirmed that the diamond quantum sensor meets the performance requirements of EV current sensors. Moreover, the temperature dependence of shot noise and external magnetic field noise were investigated, and their relation to the linewidth and contrast of the optically detected magnetic resonance spectrum were analyzed. At high temperatures, the contrast decreased because shortening of the singlet lifetime, which accelerate the initialization. At low temperatures, the contrast was slightly decreased. This is possibly a result of increased losses due to condensation on the microwave antenna.

TI Quantum Annealing based factory layout planning
SO MANUFACTURING LETTERS
AB Inadequately planned factory layouts can lead to higher operational costs. The planning process is timeconsuming and multiple planning parameters must be considered simultaneously, leading to large solution spaces. Automated planning approaches can support the planning team in the early phases of layout planning by generating layout variants that can afterwards be further specified. Recent studies from other disciplines have shown the potential of Quantum Annealing (QA) to solve complex assignment problems within seconds. Consequently, this paper presents a first implementation of a QA-based layout planning approach and demonstrates its advantages regarding scalability, solution quality, and computing time.(c) 2022 The Author(s).

TI Enhancing Key Rates of QKD Protocol by Coincidence Detection
SO ADVANCED QUANTUM TECHNOLOGIES
AB In theory, quantum key distribution (QKD) provides unconditional security; however, its practical implementations are susceptible to exploitable vulnerabilities. This investigation tackles the constraints in practical QKD implementations using weak coherent pulses. The conventional approach of using decoy pulses is improved by integrating it with the coincidence detection (CD) protocol. Additionally, an easy-to-implement technique is employed to compute asymptotic key rates for the protocol secure under specific photon number splitting (PNS) attacks. Furthermore, an experimental implementation of the protocol, where it is demonstrated that monitoring coincidences in the decoy state protocol leads to enhanced key rates under realistic experimental conditions, is carried out.

TI Operating Fiber Networks in the Quantum Limit

AB We consider all-optical networks from a quantum perspective. We show that optimal quantum receivers allow a similar to 57% decrease in energy consumption of all-optical amplifiers. Furthermore, we prove that quantum receivers allow for a logarithmic scaling of the system capacity with the number of pulses per second, while standard Shannon-type systems are limited by the transmit power. Based on our findings we argue for a new approach to optical communication network design, wherein in-line amplifiers are operated at very low gains and in conjunction with high-spectral-bandwidth fiber and a quantum receiver, enhancing data transmission in a practically relevant quantum limit.

TI Geometric Renyi Divergence and its Applications in Quantum Channel
   Capacities
SO COMMUNICATIONS IN MATHEMATICAL PHYSICS
AB Having a distance measure between quantum states satisfying the right properties is of fundamental importance in all areas of quantum information. In this work, we present a systematic study of the geometric Renyi divergence (GRD), also known as the maximal Renyi divergence, from the point of view of quantum information theory. We show that this divergence, together with its extension to channels, has many appealing structural properties, which are not satisfied by other quantum Renyi divergences. For example we prove a chain rule inequality that immediately implies the "amortization collapse" for the geometric Renyi divergence, addressing an open question by Berta et al. [Letters in Mathematical Physics 110:2277-2336, 2020, Equation (55)] in the area of quantum channel discrimination. As applications, we explore various channel capacity problems and construct new channel information measures based on the geometric Renyi divergence, sharpening the previously best-known bounds based on the max-relative entropy while still keeping the new bounds single-letter and efficiently computable. A plethora of examples are investigated and the improvements are evident for almost all cases.

TI An operational definition of quantum information scrambling
SO QUANTUM SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB Quantum information scrambling (QIS) is a characteristic feature of several quantum systems, ranging from black holes to quantum communication networks. While accurately quantifying QIS is crucial to understanding many such phenomena, common approaches based on the tripartite information have limitations due to the accessibility issues of quantum mutual information, and do not always properly take into consideration the dependence on the encoding input basis. To address these issues, we propose a novel and computationally efficient QIS quantifier, based on a formulation of QIS in terms of quantum state discrimination. We show that the optimal guessing probability, which reflects the degree of QIS induced by an isometric quantum evolution, is directly connected to the accessible min-information, a generalized channel capacity based on conditional min-entropy, which can be cast as a convex program and thus computed efficiently. By applying our proposal to a range of examples with increasing complexity, we illustrate its ability to capture the multifaceted nature of QIS in all its intricacy.

TI Quantum Circuit Implementation of Multi-Dimensional Non-Linear Lattice
   Models
SO APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL
AB The application of Quantum Computing (QC) to fluid dynamics simulation has developed into a dynamic research topic in recent years. With many flow problems of scientific and engineering interest requiring large computational resources, the potential of QC to speed-up simulations and facilitate more detailed modeling forms the main motivation for this growing research interest. Despite notable progress, many important challenges to creating quantum algorithms for fluid modeling remain. The key challenge of non-linearity of the governing equations in fluid modeling is investigated here in the context of lattice-based modeling of fluids. Quantum circuits for the D1Q3 (one-dimensional, three discrete velocities) Lattice Boltzmann model are detailed along with design trade-offs involving circuit width and depth. Then, the design is extended to a one-dimensional lattice model for the non-linear Burgers equation. To facilitate the evaluation of non-linear terms, the presented quantum circuits employ quantum computational basis encoding. The second part of this work introduces a novel, modular quantum-circuit implementation for non-linear terms in multi-dimensional lattice models. In particular, the evaluation of kinetic energy in two-dimensional models is detailed as the first step toward quantum circuits for the collision term of two- and three-dimensional Lattice Boltzmann methods. The quantum circuit analysis shows that with O(100) fault-tolerant qubits, meaningful proof-of-concept experiments could be performed in the near future.

TI Asymmetric Blockade and Multiqubit Gates via Dipole-Dipole Interactions
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB Because of their strong and tunable interactions, Rydberg atoms can be used to realize fast two-qubit entangling gates. We propose a generalization of a generic two-qubit Rydberg-blockade gate to multiqubit Rydberg-blockade gates that involve both many control qubits and many target qubits simultaneously. This is achieved by using strong microwave fields to dress nearby Rydberg states, leading to asymmetric blockade in which control-target interactions are much stronger than control-control and target-target interactions. The implementation of these multiqubit gates can drastically simplify both quantum algorithms and state preparation. To illustrate this, we show that a 25-atom Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger state can be created using only three gates with an error of 5.8%.

AB We demonstrate strong dispersive coupling between a fluxonium superconducting qubit and a 690 megahertz mechanical oscillator, extending the reach of circuit quantum acousto-dynamics (cQAD) experiments into a new range of frequencies. We have engineered a qubit-phonon coupling rate of g 2r x 14 MHz, and achieved a dispersive interaction that exceeds the decoherence rates of both systems while the qubit and mechanics are highly nonresonant (A/g >= 10). Leveraging this strong cou-pling, we perform phonon-number-resolved measurements of the mechanical resonator and investigate its dissipation and dephasing properties. Our results demonstrate the potential for fluxonium-based hybrid quantum systems, and a path for developing new quantum sensing and information processing schemes with phonons at frequencies below 700 MHz to significantly expand the toolbox of cQAD.

TI Electromotive force in driven topological quantum circuits
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
AB Time-dependent control of superconducting quantum circuits is a prerequisite for building scalable quantum hardware. The quantum description of these circuits is complicated due to the electromotive force (emf) induced by time-varying magnetic fields. Here, we examine how the emf modifies the fractional Josephson effect. We show that a time-varying flux introduces a new term that depends on the geometry of both the circuit and the applied magnetic field. This term can be probed via current and charge measurements in closed-loop and opencircuit geometries. Our results refine the current understanding of how to properly describe time-dependent control of topological quantum circuits.

TI From computing to quantum mechanics: accessible and hands-on quantum
   computing education for high school students
SO EPJ QUANTUM TECHNOLOGY
AB This paper outlines an alternative approach to teaching quantum computing at the high school level, tailored for students with limited prior knowledge in advanced mathematics and physics. This approach diverges from traditional methods by building upon foundational concepts in classical computing before gradually introducing quantum mechanics, thereby simplifying the entry into this complex field. The course was initially implemented in a program for gifted high school students under the Hong Kong Education Bureau and received encouraging feedback, indicating its potential effectiveness for a broader student audience. A key element of this approach is the practical application through portable NMR quantum computers, which provides students with hands-on experience. The paper describes the structure of the course, including the organization of the lectures, the integration of the hardware of the portable nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) quantum computers, the Gemini/Triangulum series, and detailed lecture notes in Additional file 1. The initial success in the specialized program and ongoing discussions to expand the course to regular high schools in Hong Kong and Shenzhen suggest the viability of this approach for wider educational application. By focusing on accessibility and student engagement, this approach presents a valuable perspective on introducing quantum computing concepts at the high school level, aiming to enhance student understanding and interest in the field.

TI Fast unconditional initialization for superconducting qubit and
   resonator using quantum-circuit refrigerator
SO APPLIED PHYSICS LETTERS
AB In a quantum computation scheme, such as recycling a qubit, the initialization of the qubit is always required. At present, the initialization of the qubit is one of the bottlenecks in such computation, and high fidelity and fast initialization still remain important research subjects. In this study, by coupling a SINIS (superconductor-insulator-normal metal-insulator-superconductor) junction to a coupled system consisting of a qubit and a resonator, a photon is removed from the resonator by single-photon-assisted tunneling, and the effective relaxation rate of the resonator is increased. In addition, by applying an | e , 0 > - | f , 0 > drive pulse and an | f , 0 > - | g , 1 > drive pulse to the qubit, the energy of the qubit is rapidly transferred to the resonator to realize high-speed initialization. The present simulation shows that the qubit can be initialized with 99% fidelity in 80 ns and 99.9% in 137 ns when the electron temperature of the normal metal of the SINIS junction is 10 mK. The simulation also shows that the relaxation time of the qubit is about 13% longer when the resonator is interposed between the SINIS junction and the qubit than when the SINIS junction is directly coupled to the qubit.(c) 2021 Author(s).

TI The qutrit as a heat diode and circulator
SO NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB We investigate the heat transport properties of a three-level system coupled to three thermal baths, assuming a model based on superconducting circuit implementations. The system-bath coupling is mediated by resonators which serve as frequency filters for the different qutrit transitions. Taking into account the finite quality factors of the resonators, we find thermal rectification and circulation effects not expected in configurations with perfectly-filtered couplings. Heat leakage in off-resonant transitions can be exploited to make the system work as an ideal diode where heat flows in the same direction between two baths irrespective of the sign of the temperature difference, as well as a perfect heat circulator whose state is phase-reversible.

The material is organized in three modules of increasing difficulty, and the relative implementation has been written in Qibo, an open-source software suite to simulate quantum circuits with the ability to interface with quantum hardware. The topic of inequalities allows us to not only introduce undergraduate or graduate students to crucial theoretical issues in quantum mechanics, such as entanglement, correlations, hidden variables and non-locality, but also to practically put hands on tools to implement a real simulation, where statistical aspects and noise coming from current quantum chips also come into play.

TI Hamiltonian simulation for hyperbolic partial differential equations by
   scalable quantum circuits
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Solving partial differential equations for extremely large-scale systems within a feasible computation time serves in accelerating engineering developments. Quantum computing algorithms, particularly the Hamiltonian simulations, present a potential and promising approach to achieve this purpose. Actually, there are several oracle-based Hamiltonian simulations with potential quantum speedup, but their detailed implementations and accordingly the detailed computational complexities are all unclear. This paper presents a method that enables us to explicitly implement the quantum circuit for Hamiltonian simulation; the key technique is the explicit gate construction of differential operators contained in the target partial differential equation discretized by the finite difference method. Moreover, we show that the space and time complexities of the constructed circuit are exponentially smaller than those of conventional classical algorithms. We also provide numerical experiments and an experiment on a real device for the wave equation to demonstrate the validity of our proposed method.

TI Sparse Quantum State Preparation for Strongly Correlated Systems
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY LETTERS
AB Quantum computing allows, in principle, the encoding of the exponentially scaling many-electron wave function onto a linearly scaling qubit register, offering a promising solution to overcome the limitations of traditional quantum chemistry methods. An essential requirement for ground state quantum algorithms to be practical is the initialization of the qubits to a high-quality approximation of the sought-after ground state. Quantum state preparation enables the generation of approximate eigenstates derived from classical computations but is frequently treated as an oracle in quantum information. In this study, we investigate the quantum state preparation of prototypical strongly correlated systems' ground state, up to 28 qubits, using the Hyperion-1 GPU-accelerated state-vector emulator. Various variational and nonvariational methods are compared in terms of their circuit depth and classical complexity. Our results indicate that the recently developed Overlap-ADAPT-VQE algorithm offers the most advantageous performance for near-term applications.

TI Continuous-variable quantum approximate optimization on a programmable
   photonic quantum processor
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Variational quantum algorithms (VQAs) provide a promising approach to achieving quantum advantage for practical problems on near-term noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices. Thus far, most studies on VQAs have focused on qubit-based systems, but the power of VQAs can be potentially boosted by exploiting infinite-dimensional continuous-variable (CV) systems. Here, we implement the CV version of one VQA, a quantum approximate optimization algorithm, by developing an automated collaborative computing system between a programmable photonic quantum computer and a classical computer. We experimentally demonstrate that this algorithm solves the minimization problem of simple continuous functions by implementing the quantum version of gradient descent to localize an initially broadly distributed wave function to the minimum. This method allows the execution of a practical CV quantum algorithm on a physical platform. Our work can be extended to the minimization of more general functions, providing an alternative to achieve the quantum advantage in practical problems.

TI The effects of quantum hardware properties on the performances of
   variational quantum learning algorithms
SO QUANTUM MACHINE INTELLIGENCE
AB In-depth theoretical and practical research is nowadays being performed on variational quantum algorithms (VQAs), which have the potential to surpass traditional, classical, algorithms on a variety of problems, in physics, chemistry, biology, and optimization. Because they are hybrid quantum-classical algorithms, it takes a certain set of optimal conditions for their full potential to be exploited. For VQAs, the construction of an appropriate ansatz in particular is crucial, since it lays the ground for efficiently solving the particular problem being addressed. To prevent severe negative effects that hamper quantum computation, the substantial noise, together with the structural limitations, characteristic of currently available devices must be also taken into consideration while building the ansatz. In this work the effect of the quantum hardware structure, namely the topological properties emerging from the couplings between the physical qubits and the basis gates of the device itself, on the performances of VQAs is addressed. Specifically, it is here experimentally shown that a complex connectivity in the ansatz, albeit being beneficial for exploring wider sets of solutions, introduces an overhead of gates during the transpilation on a quantum computer that increases the overall error rate, thus undermining the quality of the training. It is hence necessary, when implementing a variation quantum learning algorithm, to find the right balance between a sufficiently parametrized ansatz and a minimal cost in terms of resources during transpilation. Moreover, the experimental finding allows to construct a heuristic metric function, which aids the decision-making process on the best possible ansatz structure to be deployed on a given quantum hardware, thus fostering a more efficient application of VQAs in realistic situations. The experiments are performed on two widely used variational algorithms, the VQE (variational quantum eigensolver) and the VQC (variational quantum classifier), both tested on two different problems, the first on the Markowitz portfolio optimization using real-world financial data, and the latter on a classification task performed on the Iris dataset.

TI Room-Temperature Optical Spin Polarization of an Electron Spin Qudit in
   a Vanadyl-Free Base Porphyrin Dimer
SO JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN CHEMICAL SOCIETY
AB Photoexcited organic chromophores appended to molecular qubits can serve as a source of spin initialization or multilevel qudit generation for quantum information applications. So far, this approach has been primarily investigated in chromophore-stable radical systems. Here, we extend this concept to a meso-meso linked oxovanadium(IV) porphyrin-free-base porphyrin dimer. Femtosecond transient absorption experiments reveal that photoexcitation of the free-base porphyrin leads to picosecond triplet state formation via enhanced intersystem crossing. Time-resolved electron paramagnetic resonance (TREPR) experiments carried out at both 85 K and room temperature reveal the formation of a long-lived spin-polarized quartet state through triplet-doublet spin mixing. Notably, a distinct hyperfine structure arising from the interaction between the electron spin quartet state and the vanadyl nucleus (51V, I = 7/2) is evident, with the quartet state showing long-lived spin polarization even at room temperature. Theoretical simulations of the TREPR spectra confirm the photogenerated quartet state and provide insights into the non-Boltzmann spin populations. Exploiting this phenomenon affords the possibility of using photoinduced triplet states in porphyrins for quantum information as a resource to polarize and magnetically couple molecular electronic or nuclear spin qubits and qudits.

TI Engineering fast bias-preserving gates on stabilized cat qubits
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Stabilized cat codes can provide a biased noise channel with a set of bias-preserving (BP) gates, which can significantly reduce the resource overhead for fault-tolerant quantum computing. All existing schemes of BP gates, however, require adiabatic quantum evolution, with performance limited by excitation loss and nonadiabatic errors during the adiabatic gates. In this paper, we apply a derivative-based leakage-suppression technique to overcome nonadiabatic errors, so that we can implement fast BP gates on Kerr-cat qubits with improved gate fidelity while maintaining high noise bias. When applied to concatenated quantum error correction, the fast BP gates not only can improve the logical error rate but also can reduce resource overhead, which enables more efficient implementation of fault-tolerant quantum computing.

TI Variational quantum algorithm for molecular geometry optimization
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Classical algorithms for predicting the equilibrium geometry of strongly correlated molecules require expensive wave function methods that become impractical already for few-atom systems. In this work, we introduce a variational quantum algorithm for finding the most stable structure of a molecule by explicitly considering the parametric dependence of the electronic Hamiltonian on the nuclear coordinates. The equilibrium geometry of the molecule is obtained by minimizing a more general cost function that depends on both the quantum circuit and the Hamiltonian parameters, which are simultaneously optimized at each step. The algorithm is applied to find the equilibrium geometries of the H-2, H-3(+), BeH2, and H2O molecules. The quantum circuits used to prepare the electronic ground state for each molecule were designed using an adaptive algorithm where excitation gates in the form of Givens rotations are selected according to the norm of their gradient. All quantum simulations are performed using the PennyLane library for quantum differentiable programming The optimized geometrical parameters for the simulated molecules show an excellent agreement with their counterparts computed using classical quantum chemistry methods.

TI Quantum algorithms for transport coefficients in gauge theories

AB In the future, ab initio quantum simulations of heavy ion collisions may become possible with largescale fault-tolerant quantum computers. We propose a quantum algorithm for studying these collisions by looking at a class of observables requiring dramatically smaller volumes: transport coefficients. These form nonperturbative inputs into theoretical models of heavy ions; thus, their calculation reduces theoretical uncertainties without the need for a full-scale simulation of the collision. We derive the necessary lattice operators in the Hamiltonian formulation and describe how to obtain them on quantum computers. Additionally, we discuss ways to efficiently prepare the relevant thermal state of a gauge theory.

TI Efficient Estimation of Trainability for Variational Quantum Circuits
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB Parameterized quantum circuits used as variational ansatzes are emerging as promising tools to tackle complex problems ranging from quantum chemistry to combinatorial optimization. These variational quantum circuits can suffer from the well-known curse of barren plateaus, which is characterized by an exponential vanishing of the cost-function gradient with the system size, making training unfeasible for practical applications. Since a generic quantum circuit cannot be simulated efficiently, the determination of its trainability is an important problem. Here we find an efficient method to compute the gradient of the cost function and its variance for a wide class of variational quantum circuits. Our scheme relies on our proof of an exact mapping from randomly initialized circuits to a set of Clifford circuits that can be efficiently simulated on a classical computer by virtue of the celebrated Gottesman-Knill theorem. This method is scalable and can be used to certify trainability for variational quantum circuits and explore design strategies that can overcome the barren-plateau problem. As illustrative examples, we show results with up to 100 qubits.

TI The impact of message losses and retransmissions on quantum
   cryptographic protocols
SO COMPUTER NETWORKS
AB Quantum cryptography promises information theoretic security of several cryptographic primitives. Most of the proposed security proofs work in an ideal communication scenario where all messages are correctly delivered after the first attempt. However, real networks are subject to message losses and require retransmissions to cope with them. While the latter is hardly ever a problem in classical cryptography, with quantum communication copy-and-retransmit could be impossible due to the famous no-cloning theorem. In this work, we analyze some quantum cryptoschemes such as public-key encryption, authentication and quantum money, assuming that quantum messages may be lost as they travel through the communication medium. Although all these schemes are theoretically secure, we show that this degree of realism renders some protocols insecure or impractical, while others are completely unaffected. When possible, we provide mitigations such as teleportation or protocol modifications to circumvent these challenges.

TI Numerical security analysis for quantum key distribution with partial
   state characterization
SO QUANTUM SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB Numerical security proofs offer a versatile approach for evaluating the secret-key generation rate of quantum key distribution (QKD) protocols. However, existing methods typically require perfect source characterization, which is unrealistic in practice due to the presence of inevitable encoding imperfections and side channels. In this paper, we introduce a novel security proof technique based on semidefinite programming that can evaluate the secret-key rate for both prepare-and-measure and measurement-device-independent QKD protocols when only partial information about the emitted states is available, significantly improving the applicability and practical relevance compared to existing numerical techniques. We demonstrate that our method can outperform current analytical approaches addressing partial state characterization in terms of achievable secret-key rates, particularly for protocols with non-qubit encoding spaces. This represents a significant step towards bridging the gap between theoretical security proofs and practical QKD implementations.

TI MQT Predictor: Automatic Device Selection with Device-Specific Circuit
   Compilation for Quantum Computing
SO ACM TRANSACTIONS ON QUANTUM COMPUTING
AB Fueled by recent accomplishments in quantum computing hardware and software, an increasing number of problems from various application domains are being explored as potential use cases for this new technology. Similarly to classical computing, realizing an application on a particular quantum device requires the corresponding (quantum) circuit to be compiled so that it can be executed on the device. With a steadily growing number of available devices-each with their own advantages and disadvantages-and a wide variety of different compilation tools, the number of choices to consider when trying to realize an application is quickly exploding. Due to missing tool support and automation, especially end-users who are not quantum computing experts are easily left unsupported and overwhelmed. In this work, we propose a methodology that allows one to automatically select a suitable quantum device for a particular application and provides an optimized compiler for the selected device. The resulting framework-called the MQT Predictor-not only supports end-users in navigating the vast landscape of choices, it also allows mixing and matching compiler passes from various tools to create optimized compilers that transcend the individual tools. Evaluations of an exemplary framework instantiation based on more than 500 quantum circuits and seven devices have shown that-compared with both Qiskit's and TKET's most optimized compilation flows for all devices-the MQT Predictor produces circuits within the top-3 out of 14 baselines in more than 98% of cases while frequently outperforming any tested combination by up to 53% when optimizing for expected fidelity. Additionally, the framework is trained and evaluated for critical depth as another figure of merit to showcase its flexibility and generalizability-producing circuits within the top-3 in 89% of cases while frequently outperforming any tested combination by up to 400%. MQT Predictor is part of the Munich Quantum Toolkit (MQT) and publicly available as open-source on GitHub (https://github.com/cdatum/mqt-predictor) and as an easy-to-use Python package (https://pypi.org/p/mqt.predictor).

TI Parameter-parallel distributed variational quantum algorithm
SO SCIPOST PHYSICS
AB Variational quantum algorithms (VQAs) have emerged as a promising near-term tech-nique to explore practical quantum advantage on noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices. However, the inefficient parameter training process due to the incom-patibility with backpropagation and the cost of a large number of measurements, posing a great challenge to the large-scale development of VQAs. Here, we propose a parameter -parallel distributed variational quantum algorithm (PPD-VQA), to accelerate the training process by parameter-parallel training with multiple quantum processors. To maintain the high performance of PPD-VQA in the realistic noise scenarios, a alternate training strategy is proposed to alleviate the acceleration attenuation caused by noise differ-ences among multiple quantum processors, which is an unavoidable common problem of distributed VQA. Besides, the gradient compression is also employed to overcome the potential communication bottlenecks. The achieved results suggest that the PPD-VQA could provide a practical solution for coordinating multiple quantum processors to han-dle large-scale real-word applications.

TI Quantum synchronizing words
SO NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB Synchronizing words in classical automata theory provide a mechanism to reset any state of a deterministic automaton to a specific target state via a carefully chosen finite sequence of transition rules. In this work, we extend the concept of synchronizing words to quantum information theory. Specifically, we investigate whether the concatenation of two non-resetting quantum channels can give rise to a resetting channel. While we formulate the problem for general qudits, the complexity of the setting leads us to focus on particular resetting concatenations for qubits and qutrits. Furthermore, we demonstrate that following the reset, any pure real qutrit state can be closely approximated using the same two non-resetting channels. These findings establish a quantum analogue of synchronizing words, highlighting their potential applications in constructing minimal sets of quantum channels capable of both resetting and preparing arbitrary states.

TI Inference-Based Quantum Sensing
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB In a standard quantum sensing (QS) task one aims at estimating an unknown parameter theta, encoded into an n-qubit probe state, via measurements of the system. The success of this task hinges on the ability to correlate changes in the parameter to changes in the system response R(theta) (i.e., changes in the measurement outcomes). For simple cases the form of Ro.THORN is known, but the same cannot be said for realistic scenarios, as no general closed-form expression exists. In this Letter, we present an inference-based scheme for QS. We show that, for a general class of unitary families of encoding, R(theta) can be fully characterized by only measuring the system response at 2n + 1 parameters. This allows us to infer the value of an unknown parameter given the measured response, as well as to determine the sensitivity of the scheme, which characterizes its overall performance. We show that inference error is, with high probability, smaller than delta, if one measures the system response with a number of shots that scales only as Omega(log(3)(n)/delta(2)). Furthermore, the framework presented can be broadly applied as it remains valid for arbitrary probe states and measurement schemes, and, even holds in the presence of quantum noise. We also discuss how to extend our results beyond unitary families. Finally, to showcase our method we implement it for a QS task on real quantum hardware, and in numerical simulations.

TI Toward efficient quantum computation of molecular ground-state energies
SO AICHE JOURNAL
AB Variational quantum eigensolvers (VQEs) represent a promising approach to computing molecular ground states and energies on modern quantum computers. These approaches use a classical computer to optimize the parameters of a trial wave function, while the quantum computer simulates the energy by preparing and measuring a set of bitstring observations, referred to as shots, over which an expected value is computed. Although more shots improve the accuracy of the expected ground state, it also increases the simulation cost. Hence, we propose modifications to the standard Bayesian optimization algorithm to leverage few-shot circuit observations to solve VQEs with fewer quantum resources. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed approach, Bayesian optimization with priors on surface topology (BOPT), by comparing optimizers for molecular systems and demonstrate how current quantum hardware can aid in finding ground-state energies.

TI Fast and robust quantum state transfer via a topological chain
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB We propose a fast and robust quantum state transfer protocol employing a Su-Schrieffer-Heeger chain, where the interchain couplings vary in time. Based on simple considerations around the terms involved in the definition of the adiabatic invariant, we construct an exponential time-driving function that successfully takes advantage of resonant effects to speed up the transfer process. Using optimal control theory, we confirm that the proposed time-driving function is close to optimal. To unravel the crucial aspects of our construction, we proceed to a comparison with two other approaches: one where the underlying Su-Schrieffer-Heeger chain is adiabatically time-driven and another where the underlying chain is topologically trivial and resonant effects are at work. By numerically investigating the resilience of each protocol to static noise, we highlight the robustness of the exponential driving.

TI On-Demand Generation of Entangled Photon Pairs in the Telecom C-Band
   with InAs Quantum Dots
SO ACS PHOTONICS
AB Entangled photons are an integral part in quantum optics experiments and a key resource in quantum imaging, quantum communication, and photonic quantum information processing. Making this resource available on-demand has been an ongoing scientific challenge with enormous progress in recent years. Of particular interest is the potential to transmit quantum information over long distances, making photons the only reliable flying qubit. Entangled photons at the telecom C-band could be directly launched into single-mode optical fibers, enabling worldwide quantum communication via existing telecommunication infrastructure. However, the on-demand generation of entangled photons at this desired wavelength window has been elusive. Here, we show a photon pair generation efficiency of 69.9 +/- 3.6% in the telecom C-band by an InAs/GaAs semiconductor quantum dot on a metamorphic buffer layer. Using a robust phonon-assisted two-photon excitation scheme we measure a maximum concurrence of 91.4 +/- 3.8% and a peak fidelity to the Phi(+) state of 95.2 +/- 1.1%, verifying on-demand generation of strongly entangled photon pairs and marking an important milestone for interfacing quantum light sources with our classical fiber networks.

TI Uncovering quantum many-body scars with quantum machine learning
SO NPJ QUANTUM INFORMATION
AB Quantum many-body scars are rare eigenstates hidden within the chaotic spectra of many-body systems, representing a weak violation of the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis (ETH). Identifying these scars, as well as other non-thermal states in complex quantum systems, remains a significant challenge. Besides exact scar states, the nature of other non-thermal states lacking simple analytical characterization remains an open question. In this study, we employ tools from quantum machine learning-specifically, (enhanced) quantum convolutional neural networks (QCNNs), to explore hidden non-thermal states in chaotic many-body systems. Our simulations demonstrate that QCNNs achieve over 99% single-shot measurement accuracy in identifying all known scars. Furthermore, we successfully identify new non-thermal states in models such as the xorX model, the PXP model, and the far-coupling Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model. In the xorX model, some of these non-thermal states can be approximately described as spin-wave modes of specific quasiparticles. We further develop effective tight-binding Hamiltonians within the quasiparticle subspace to capture key features of these many-body eigenstates. Finally, we validate the performance of QCNNs on IBM quantum devices, achieving single-shot measurement accuracy exceeding 63% under real-world noise and errors, with the aid of error mitigation techniques. Our results underscore the potential of QCNNs to uncover hidden non-thermal states in quantum many-body systems.

TI Layered Semiconductors Integrated with Polyimide Thin Films for
   High-Quality Valleytronic and Quantum-Photonic Systems
SO ADVANCED MATERIALS TECHNOLOGIES
AB Dielectric encapsulation/isolation of layered semiconductors is a prerequisite for fabricating high-quality optoelectronic, valleytronic, and quantum-photonic devices. While hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) is the current benchmark dielectric, exploration of the most suitable dielectric materials covering the complete substrates continues to expand. This work demonstrates the formation of high optical-quality excitons in two widely explored layered semiconductors, WSe2 and WS2, integrated into polyimide (PI) thin films of thicknesses approximate to 500 nm. The photoluminescence (PL) studies at T = 296 K show the formation of neutral excitons (X0) and trions in fully-PI-encapsulated 1L-WSe2 with 2-sigma (2 sigma) spatial-inhomogeneity of 4.5 (3.4) meV in X0 emission energy (linewidth), which is approximate to 1/3rd (1/5th), respectively, that of inhomogeneity measured in fully-hBN-encapsulated 1L-WSe2. A smaller 2 sigma of 2.1 (2.3) meV in X0 emission energy (linewidth) is shown for fully-PI-encapsulated 1L-WS2. Polarization-resolved and excitation power-dependent PL measurements of PI-isolated 1L-TMDs at T = 4 K further reveal formations of high-quality neutral-biexcitons and negatively-charged biexcitons, with degrees of valley-polarization up to 21% under non-resonant excitation. Furthermore, the fully-PI-encapsulated 1L-WSe2 also hosts single quantum emitters with narrow linewidths and high-spectral stability. This work indicates that PI thin films may serve the purpose of high-quality dielectric material for integrating the layered materials on a wafer scale.

   scrambling for navigating the learning landscape of a quantum machine
   learning model
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB We introduce and analytically illustrate that hitherto unexplored imaginary components of out-of-time order correlators can provide unprecedented insight into the information scrambling capacity of a graph neural network. Furthermore, we demonstrate that it can be related to conventional measures of correlation like quantum mutual information and rigorously establish the inherent mathematical bounds (both upper and lower bound) jointly shared by such seemingly disparate quantities. To consolidate the geometrical ramifications of such bounds during the dynamical evolution of training we thereafter construct an emergent convex space. This newly designed space offers much surprising information including the saturation of lower bound by the trained network even for physical systems of large sizes, transference, and quantitative mirroring of spin correlation from the simulated physical system across phase boundaries as desirable features within the latent subunits of the network (even though the latent units are directly oblivious to the simulated physical system) and the ability of the network to distinguish exotic spin connectivity (volume law vs area law). Such an analysis demystifies the training of quantum machine learning models by unraveling how quantum information is scrambled through such a network introducing correlation surreptitiously among its constituent subsystems and open a window into the underlying physical mechanism behind the emulative ability of the model.

TI Mixing and localization in random time-periodic quantum circuits of
   Clifford unitaries
SO JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICAL PHYSICS
AB How much do local and time-periodic dynamics resemble a random unitary? In the present work, we address this question by using the Clifford formalism from quantum computation. We analyze a Floquet model with disorder, characterized by a family of local, time-periodic, and random quantum circuits in one spatial dimension. We observe that the evolution operator enjoys an extra symmetry at times that are a half-integer multiple of the period. With this, we prove that after the scrambling time, namely, when any initial perturbation has propagated throughout the system, the evolution operator cannot be distinguished from a (Haar) random unitary when all qubits are measured with Pauli operators. This indistinguishability decreases as time goes on, which is in high contrast to the more studied case of (time-dependent) random circuits. We also prove that the evolution of Pauli operators displays a form of mixing. These results require the dimension of the local subsystem to be large. In the opposite regime, our system displays a novel form of localization, produced by the appearance of effective one-sided walls, which prevent perturbations from crossing the wall in one direction but not the other.

AB The "Noisy intermediate-scale quantum" NISQ machine era primarily focuses on mitigating noise, controlling errors, and executing high-fidelity operations, hence requiring shallow circuit depth and noise robustness. Approximate computing is a novel computing paradigm that produces imprecise results by relaxing the need for fully precise output for error-tolerant applications including multimedia, data mining, and image processing. We investigate how approximate computing can improve the noise resilience of quantum adder circuits in NISQ quantum computing. We propose five designs of approximate quantum adders to reduce depth while making them noise-resilient, in which three designs are with carryout, while two are without carryout. We have used novel design approaches that include approximating the Sum only from the inputs (pass-through designs) and having zero depth, as they need no quantum gates. The second design style uses a single CNOT gate to approximate the SUM with a constant depth of O(1). We performed our experimentation on IBM Qiskit on noise models including thermal, depolarizing, amplitude damping, phase damping, and bitflip: (i) Compared to exact quantum ripple carry adder without carryout the proposed approximate adders without carryout have improved fidelity ranging from 8.34% to 219.22%, and (ii) Compared to exact quantum ripple carry adder with carryout the proposed approximate adders with carryout have improved fidelity ranging from 8.23% to 371%. Further, the proposed approximate quantum adders are evaluated in terms of various error metrics.

TI Energy Use in Quantum Data Centers: Scaling the Impact of Computer
   Architecture, Qubit Performance, Size, and Thermal Parameters
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON SUSTAINABLE COMPUTING
AB As quantum computers increase in size, the total energy used by a quantum data center, including the cooling, will become a greater concern. The cooling requirements of quantum computers, which operate at temperatures near absolute zero, are determined by computing system parameters, including the number and type of physical qubits, the packaging efficiency of the system, and the split between circuits operating at cryogenic temperatures and those operating at room temperature. When combined with thermal system parameters such as cooling efficiency and cryostat heat transfer, the total energy use can be determined using a first-principles energy model. These models show that cooling of quantum computers differs in two fundamental ways from conventional data centers: (1) the energy required for cooling is much greater than the energy required for computation, and (2) the cooling loads are sensitive to the computational architecture. The temperature requirements for different qubit types can change energy requirements by orders of magnitude. Power use and computational power, as quantified by quantum volume, are analytically correlated. Approaches are identified for minimizing energy use in integrated quantum systems relative to computational power. Designing a sustainable quantum computer will require both efficient cooling and system design that minimizes cooling requirements.

TI Beyond the Bad Actor Narrative: Reconsidering Ethical Imagination in
   Quantum Computing
SO NANOETHICS
AB The development of emerging technologies is often accompanied by socially constructed narratives that shape the perceptions of the technology but also the ethical responsibility. This paper is investigating one particular narrative, prevailing, among others, in the field of quantum computing: The bad actor narrative. This narrative attributes potential harms caused by the technology to malicious adversaries or users with hostile intentions using the technology in unintended ways, rather than to the design, deployment, or intended uses of the developers itself. The paper critically examines the ethical implications of the bad actor narrative, arguing that it produces three major problems: it narrows ethical reflection to concerns about misuse, shifts responsibility along the innovation chain, and overshadows broader debates thus focussing attention on one particular problem. Drawing on insights from Science and Technology Studies (STS), technology assessment, responsible innovation and the sociology of expectations, this paper proposes a way to approach this narrative and creating a shared responsibility that recognizes ethical agency at every stage of technological development. By deliberately embedding values into design processes and reclaiming the ethical imagination, developers and researchers can move beyond reactive threat models and actively shape more inclusive, just, and sustainable narratives of technological futures. Rather than viewing responsibility as a burden, this paper argues that it should be embraced as a source of empowerment, i.e. a critical condition for realizing the transformative potential of quantum technologies in alignment with the common good.

Based on the classical-classical-quantum(ccq) states whose quantum parts are obtained from the two-party reduced density matrices of a three-party quantum state, we show the additivity of the mutual information of the ccq states guarantees the monogamy inequality of the three-party pure state in terms of EoF. After illustrating the result with some examples, we generalize our result of three-party systems into any multi-party systems of arbitrary dimensions.

TI Loophole-free Bell inequality violation with superconducting circuits
SO NATURE
AB Superposition, entanglement and non-locality constitute fundamental features of quantum physics. The fact that quantum physics does not follow the principle of local causality(1-3) can be experimentally demonstrated in Bell tests(4) performed on pairs of spatially separated, entangled quantum systems. Although Bell tests, which are widely regarded as a litmus test of quantum physics, have been explored using a broad range of quantum systems over the past 50 years, only relatively recently have experiments free of so-called loopholes5 succeeded. Such experiments have been performed with spins in nitrogen-vacancy centres6, optical photons(7-9) and neutral atoms(10). Here we demonstrate a loophole-free violation of Bell's inequality with superconducting circuits, which are a prime contender for realizing quantum computing technology(11). To evaluate a Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt-type Bell inequality(4), we deterministically entangle a pair of qubits(12) and perform fast and high-fidelity measurements(13) along randomly chosen bases on the qubits connected through a cryogenic link(14) spanning a distance of 30 metres. Evaluating more than 1 million experimental trials, we find an average S value of 2.0747 +/- 0.0033, violating Bell ' s inequality with a P value smaller than 10(-108). Our work demonstrates that non-locality is a viable new resource in quantum information technology realized with superconducting circuits with potential applications in quantum communication, quantum computing and fundamental physics(15).

Coupled cavity array is one of the well-studied systems to carry out these tasks. It is a versatile platform for quantum networks for distributed information processing and communication. Cavities have the salient feature of retaining photons for longer durations, thereby enabling them to travel coherently through the array without losing them in dissipation. Many quantum information protocols have been implemented in arrays of coupled cavities. These advancements promise the suitability of cavity arrays for large-scale quantum communications and computations. This article reviews a few theoretical proposals and experimental realizations of quantum information tasks in cavities.

TI Quantum AI for Alzheimer's disease early screening
SO NEUROCOMPUTING
AB Quantum machine learning is a new research field combining quantum information science and machine learning. Quantum computing technologies appear to be particularly well-suited for addressing problems in the health sector efficiently. They have the potential to handle large datasets more effectively than classical models and offer greater transparency and interpretability for clinicians. Alzheimer's disease is a neurodegenerative brain disorder that mostly affects elderly people, causing important cognitive impairments. It is the most common cause of dementia and it has an effect on memory, thought, learning abilities and movement control. This type of disease has no cure, consequently an early diagnosis is fundamental for reducing its impact. The analysis of handwriting can be effective for diagnosing, as many researches have conjectured. The DARWIN (Diagnosis AlzheimeR WIth haNdwriting) dataset contains handwriting samples from people affected by Alzheimer's disease and a group of healthy people. Here we apply quantum AI to this use-case. In particular, we use this dataset to test classical methods for classification and compare their performances with the ones obtained via quantum machine learning methods. We find that quantum methods generally perform better than classical methods. Our results pave the way for future new quantum machine learning applications in early-screening diagnostics in the healthcare domain.

TI Analytic Review of Healthcare Software by Using Quantum Computing
   Security Techniques
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF FUZZY LOGIC AND INTELLIGENT SYSTEMS
AB The core objective of this security research is to ensure that healthcare software (HS) is secure when operating on a fully functional quantum computer. Developers are constantly coming up with innovative methods to maintain usability while maximizing security. The degree of security is not as high as it should be despite numerous efforts made in this area by developers and security specialists. It is also crucial to conduct additional research on the best methods for enhancing and assessing the security of healthcare technologies. This study specifically aims to assess the security of HS during quantum computing (QC) operations. Based on the empirical analysis of a substantial amount of data, this study makes recommendations for creating a secure HS. In the quantum age, decision-makers frequently experience difficulties in integrating extremely secure software. This study aims for the inclusion of security-related aspects. This study also suggests utilizing a novel technique that evaluates healthcare software security (HSS) simultaneously using the analytic hierarchy process (AHP), fuzzy sets (FS), and a method for order of preference by similarity to an ideal solution (TOPSIS). The F-AHP and F-TOPSIS hybrid solution techniques were evaluated using 10 quantum security algorithms. The security assessment conclusions indicate that this cutting-edge hybrid technique is the most accurate and useful method to evaluate the security of an HS. Most importantly, these findings will benefit security management without jeopardizing end users.

TI Ultralong Room-Temperature Qubit Lifetimes of Covalent Organic
   Frameworks
SO JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN CHEMICAL SOCIETY
AB Molecular electron spin qubits offer atomic-level tunability and room-temperature quantum coherence. Their integration into engineered solid-state matrices can enhance performance toward ambient quantum information technologies. Herein, we demonstrate covalent organic frameworks (COFs) as programmable matrices for stable organic radical qubits, allowing strategic optimization of spin-phonon and spin-spin interactions. Using two classic boronate-ester frameworks, COF-5 and COF-108, to host semiquinone-like radical qubits, we achieve an ultralong spin relaxation time (T-1 > 300 mu s) at 298 K, which outperforms most molecular qubits and rivals inorganic spin defects. The suppression of spin relaxation is attributed to rigid and neutral structures as well as carbon-centered spin distributions that effectively weaken spin-phonon coupling. Employing dynamical decoupling methods to both COFs improves their quantum coherence and enables room-temperature detection of nuclear spins, including H-1, B-11, and C-13. Our work establishes COFs as designer quantum materials, opening new avenues for quantum sensing of nuclear spins at room temperature.

TI Nonadiabatic holonomic quantum computation based on a commutation
   relation
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Nonadiabatic holonomic quantum computation has received increasing attention due to the merits of both robustness against control errors and high-speed implementation. A crucial step in realizing nonadiabatic holonomic quantum computation is to remove the dynamical phase from the total phase. For this reason, previous schemes of nonadiabatic holonomic quantum computation have to resort to the parallel transport condition, i.e., requiring the instantaneous dynamical phase to be always zero. In this paper, we put forward a strategy to design nonadiabatic holonomic quantum computation, which is based on a commutation relation rather than the parallel transport condition. Instead of requiring the instantaneous dynamical phase to be always zero, the dynamical part of the total phase is separated from the geometric part and then removed by properly choosing evolution parameters. This strategy enhances the flexibility to realize nonadiabatic holonomic quantum computation as the commutation relation is more relaxed than the parallel transport condition. It provides more options for realizing nonadiabatic holonomic quantum computation and hence allows us to optimize realizations such as the evolution time and evolution paths.

TI Adaptively partitioned analog quantum simulation on near-term quantum
   computers: The nonclassical free-induction decay of NV centers in
   diamond
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB The idea of simulating quantum physics with controllable quantum devices had been proposed several decades ago. With the extensive development of quantum technology, large-scale simulation, such as the analog quantum simulation tailoring an artificial Hamiltonian mimicking the system of interest, has been implemented on elaborate quantum experimental platforms. However, due to the limitations caused by the significant noises and the connectivity, analog simulation is generically infeasible on near-term quantum computing platforms. Here we propose an alternative analog simulation approach on near-term quantum devices. Our approach circumvents the limitations by adaptively partitioning the bath into several groups based on the performance of the quantum devices. We apply our approach to simulate the free induction decay of the electron spin in a diamond NV- center coupled to a huge number of nuclei and investigate the nonclassicality induced by the nuclear spin polarization. The simulation is implemented collaboratively with authentic devices and simulators on IBM quantum computers. We have also applied our approach to address the nonclassical noise caused by the crosstalk between qubits. This work sheds light on a flexible approach to simulate large-scale materials on noisy near-term quantum computers.

TI Discord and decoherence
SO JOURNAL OF COSMOLOGY AND ASTROPARTICLE PHYSICS
AB In quantum information theory, quantum discord has been proposed as a tool to characterise the presence of ???quantum correlations??? between the subparts of a given system. Whether a system behaves quantum-mechanically or classically is believed to be impacted by the phenomenon of decoherence, which originates from the unavoidable interaction between this system and an environment. Generically, decoherence is associated with a decrease of the state purity, i.e. a transition from a pure to a mixed state. In this paper, we investigate how quantum discord is modified by this quantum-to-classical transition. This study is carried out on systems described by quadratic Hamiltonians and Gaussian states, with generalised squeezing parameters. A generic parametrisation is also introduced to describe the way the system is partitioned into two subsystems. We find that the evolution of quantum discord in presence of an environment is a competition between the growth of the squeezing amplitude and the decrease of the state purity. In phase space, this corresponds to whether the semi-minor axis of the Wigner ellipse increases or decreases, which has a clear geometrical interpretation. Finally, these considerations are applied to primordial cosmological perturbations, thus allowing us to investigate how large-scale structures in our universe, which are believed to arise from quantum fluctuations, can exhibit classical properties.

TI Experimentally Demonstrating Indefinite Causal Order Algorithms to Solve
   the Generalized Deutsch's Problem
SO ADVANCED QUANTUM TECHNOLOGIES
AB Deutsch's algorithm is the first quantum algorithm to demonstrate an advantage over classical algorithms. Here, Deutsch's problem is generalized to n functions and a quantum algorithm with an indefinite causal order is proposed to solve this problem. The algorithm not only reduces the number of queries to the black box by half compared to the classical algorithm, but also significantly decreases the complexity of the quantum circuit and the number of required quantum gates compared to the generalized Deutsch's algorithm. The algorithm is experimentally demonstrated in a stable Sagnac loop interferometer with a common path, which overcomes the obstacles of both phase instability and low fidelity of the Mach-Zehnder interferometer. The experimental results show both ultrahigh and robust success probabilities approximate to 99.7. This study opens a path toward solving practical problems with indefinite cause-order quantum circuits.

TI The role of quantum computing in advancing plasma physics simulations
   for fusion energy and high-energy
SO FRONTIERS IN PHYSICS
AB Its complexity constrains advancements in fusion energy and high energy applications driven by plasma physics, multiscale phenomena beyond classical computing limits. These transformative solutions, especially in plasma simulations, for which exponential speedup is possible, represent significant promise toward breakthroughs in sustainable energy and extreme state studies. In this review, Quantum Computing (QC) is explored as a means to drive plasma physics simulations forward by providing applications such as fusion energy and high-energy systems. This includes computational methods for simulating turbulence, wave-particle interactions, and Magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) instabilities that have near-quantum efficiency. We show that by integrating QC into plasma research, one can solve large-scale linear equations, compute eigenvalues, and optimize complex systems, performing better than classical methods. This discussion examines the potential of quantum computing for plasma physics, highlighting its current limitations, including hardware constraints and the need for specialized algorithms tailored to model complex plasma phenomena accurately. These challenges notwithstanding, QC has the potential to dramatically change plasma modeling and expedite the development of fusion reactors. QC represents a new approach to engineer away computational bottlenecks, providing unprecedented views of plasma behavior needed for sustainable energy breakthroughs. The results from this work underscore the continued importance of looking outside of plasma physics to realize QC's full potential in advancing high-energy science.

TI Resonant metasurfaces for generating complex quantum states
SO SCIENCE
AB Quantum state engineering, the cornerstone of quantum photonic technologies, mainly relies on spontaneous parametric downconversion and four-wave mixing, where one or two pump photons spontaneously decay into a photon pair. Both of these nonlinear effects require momentum conservation for the participating photons, which strongly limits the versatility of the resulting quantum states. Nonlinear metasurfaces have subwavelength thickness and allow the relaxation of this constraint; when combined with resonances, they greatly expand the possibilities of quantum state engineering. Here, we generated entangled photons via spontaneous parametric downconversion in semiconductor metasurfaces with high-quality factor, quasi-bound state in the continuum resonances. By enhancing the quantum vacuum field, ourmetasurfaces boost the emission of nondegenerate entangled photons within multiple narrow resonance bands and over a wide spectral range. A single resonance or several resonances in the same sample, pumped at multiple wavelengths, can generate multifrequency quantum states, including cluster states. These features reveal metasurfaces as versatile sources of complex states for quantum information.

TI Molecular transistors as substitutes for quantum information
   applications
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICS-CONDENSED MATTER
AB Applications of quantum information science (QIS) generally rely on the generation and manipulation of qubits. Still, there are ways to envision a device with a continuous readout, but without the entangled states. This concise perspective includes a discussion on an alternative to the qubit, namely the solid-state version of the Mach-Zehnder interferometer, in which the local moments and spin polarization replace light polarization. In this context, we provide some insights into the mathematics that dictates the fundamental working principles of quantum information processes that involve molecular systems with large magnetic anisotropy. Transistors based on such systems lead to the possibility of fabricating logic gates that do not require entangled states. Furthermore, some novel approaches, worthy of some consideration, exist to address the issues pertaining to the scalability of quantum devices, but face the challenge of finding the suitable materials for desired functionality that resemble what is sought from QIS devices.

TI Analysis and mitigation of residual exchange coupling in linear
   spin-qubit arrays
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB In recent advancements of quantum computing utilizing spin qubits, it has been demonstrated that this platform possesses the potential for implementing two-qubit gates with fidelities exceeding 99.5%. However, as with other qubit platforms, it is not feasible to completely turn qubit couplings off. This study aims to investigate the impact of coherent error matrices in gate set tomography by employing a double quantum dot. We evaluate the infidelity caused by residual exchange between spins and compare various mitigation approaches, including the use of adjusted timing through simple drives, considering different parameter settings in the presence of charge noise. Furthermore, we extend our analysis to larger arrays of exchange-coupled spin qubits to provide an estimation of the expected fidelity. In particular, we demonstrate the influence of residual exchange on a single-qubit Y gate and the native two-qubit SWAP gate in a linear chain. Our findings emphasize the significance of accounting for residual exchange when scaling up spin-qubit devices and highlight the tradeoff between the effects of charge noise and residual exchange in mitigation techniques.

TI A variational quantum algorithm for Hamiltonian diagonalization
SO QUANTUM SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB Hamiltonian diagonalization is at the heart of understanding physical properties and practical applications of quantum systems. It is highly desired to design quantum algorithms that can speedup Hamiltonian diagonalization, especially those can be implemented on near-term quantum devices. In this work, we propose a variational quantum algorithm for Hamiltonian diagonalization (VQHD) of quantum systems, which explores the important physical properties, such as temperature, locality, and correlation, of the system. The key idea is that the thermal states of the system encode the information of eigenvalues and eigenstates of the system Hamiltonian. To obtain the full spectrum of the Hamiltonian, we use a quantum imaginary time evolution algorithm with high temperature, which prepares a thermal state with a small correlation length. With Trotterization, this then allows us to implement each step of imaginary time evolution by a local unitary transformation on only a small number of sites. Diagonalizing these thermal states hence leads to a full knowledge of the Hamiltonian eigensystem. We apply our algorithm to diagonalize local Hamiltonians and return results with high precision. Our VQHD algorithm sheds new light on the applications of near-term quantum computers.

TI Three-flavor collective neutrino oscillation simulations on a qubit
   quantum annealer
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW D
AB In extreme environments such as core-collapse supernovae, neutron-star mergers, and the early Universe, neutrinos are dense enough that their self-interactions significantly affect, if not dominate, their flavor dynamics. In order to develop techniques for characterizing the resulting quantum entanglement, I present the results of simulations of Dirac neutrino-neutrino interactions that include all three physical neutrino flavors and were performed on D-Wave Inc.'s Advantage 5000 & thorn; qubit quantum annealer. These results are checked against those from exact classical simulations, which are also used to compare the Dirac neutrino-neutrino interactions to neutrino-antineutrino and Majorana neutrino-neutrino interactions. The D-Wave Advantage annealer is shown to be able to reproduce time evolution with the precision of a classical machine for small numbers of neutrinos and to do so without Trotter errors. However, it suffers from poor scaling in qubit-count with the number of neutrinos.

Mediated by a quantum link that establishes a bidirectional quantum channel between distant nodes, our proposal works both for inter- and intranode communication and handles scenarios ranging from the few to the many modes limit of the quantum link We are able to design fast and reliable state transfer protocols in every regime of operation, which, together with a detailed description of the scattering process, allows us to engineer two sets of deterministic universal distributed quantum gates: gates whose implementation in quantum networks does not need entanglement distribution nor measurements. By employing a realistic description of the physical setup we identify the most relevant imperfections in the quantum links as well as optimal points of operation with resulting infidelities of 1 - F approximate to 10(-2)-10(-3).

TI A quantum annealing approach to ionic diffusion in solids
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB We have developed a framework for using quantum annealing computation to evaluate a key quantity in ionic diffusion in solids, the correlation factor. Existing methods can only calculate the correlation factor analytically in the case of physically unrealistic models, making it difficult to relate microstructural information about diffusion path networks obtainable by current ab initio techniques to macroscopic quantities such as diffusion coefficients. We have mapped the problem into a quantum spin system described by the Ising Hamiltonian. By applying our framework in combination with ab initio technique, it is possible to understand how diffusion coefficients are controlled by temperatures, pressures, atomic substitutions, and other factors. We have calculated the correlation factor in a simple case with a known exact result by a variety of computational methods, including simulated quantum annealing on the spin models, the classical random walk, the matrix description, and quantum annealing on D-Wave with hybrid solver . This comparison shows that all the evaluations give consistent results with each other, but that many of the conventional approaches require infeasible computational costs. Quantum annealing is also currently infeasible because of the cost and scarcity of qubits, but we argue that when technological advances alter this situation, quantum annealing will easily outperform all existing methods.

TI Qubit fidelity distribution under stochastic Schrödinger equations
   driven by classical noise
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Environmental noise affecting controlled quantum systems is typically described by a dissipative Lindblad equation, which captures the system's average state through the density matrix rho. One approach to deriving this equation involves a stochastic operator evolving under white noise in the Schr & ouml;dinger equation; however, white noise fails to accurately depict real-world noise profiles, where lower frequencies often dominate. This study proposes a method to determine the analytic distribution of qubit fidelities in significant stochastic Schr & ouml;dinger equation scenarios, with qubits evolving under more realistic noise profiles such as Ornstein-Uhlenbeck noise. This method enables the prediction of the mean, variance, and higher-order moments of qubit fidelities, offering insights crucial for assessing permissible noise levels in prospective quantum computing systems and guiding decisions about control systems procurement. Additionally, these methodologies are essential for optimizing qubit state control affected by classical control system noise.

TI Noninvasive estimation of blood glucose and HbA1c using Quantum Machine
   Learning technique
SO MACHINE LEARNING WITH APPLICATIONS
AB In this paper, we developed models with quantum and classical machine learning algorithms to detect blood glucose and HbA1c noninvasively from ten-second fingertip video by deploying a smartphone and near-infrared spectroscopy. Using our developed framework, we collected 136 participants' ten-second fingertip videos with their baseline blood glucose and HbA1c levels after getting approval from the Institutional Review Board (IRB). We extracted 45 PPG (photoplethysmography) features from the ten-second fingertip video by using the Beer- Lambert law and applied feature engineering to select the most important features. We applied two Quantum Machine Learning (QML) based algorithms and seven Classical Machine Learning (CML) based algorithms for estimating blood glucose and HbA1c levels. The application of QML for the noninvasive estimation of blood glucose and HbA1c is anew and unexplored research area. Among all developed models, the Quantum Support Vector Machine performs best for predicting both blood glucose and HbA1c. The Quantum Support Vector Machine provides an accuracy of 89.30% and an average k-fold cross-validation score of 92.50% for blood glucose prediction and an accuracy of 96.30% and an average k-fold cross-validation score of 92.50% for HbA1c prediction. Our study signifies the potential of QML algorithms in noninvasive health monitoring, especially in the less-explored area of blood glucose and HbA1c estimation. The high performance of the developed models paves the way for advancing noninvasive techniques for measuring blood constituents. These findings offer promising applications in personalized healthcare, including continuous monitoring, early disease diagnosis, and more convenient management of chronic conditions.

AB Significant efforts are being directed toward developing a quantum simulator capable of solving combinatorial optimization problems. The challenges are Hamiltonian programming in terms of high-dimensional qubit connectivities and large-scale implementations. Here, we report a quantum simulation demonstration of Ising Hamiltonians with up to N = 22 spins mapped on various Cayley-tree graphs. For this, we use three-dimensional arrangements of Rydberg single atoms arranged in such a way that their Rydberg atoms and blockaded strong couplings respectively represent the vertices and edges of each graph. Three different Cayley-tree graphs of Z = 3 neighbors and of up to S = 4 shells are constructed, and their many-body ground states and Neel's order formations are experimentally probed. The antiferromagnetic phase in regular Cayley trees and frustrated competing ground states in a dual-center Cayley tree are directly observed, demonstrating the possibilities of high-dimensional qubit connections in quantum simulators.

AB The realization of electron-spin resonance at the single-atom level using scanning tunneling microscopy has opened avenues for coherent quantum sensing and quantum state manipulation at the ultimate size limit. This allows us to build many-body Hamiltonians and the study of their complex physical behavior. Recently, a qubit platform has emerged from this field, raising questions about the driving mechanism from single-atom magnets. In this work, we demonstrate how single-atom magnets can be used to drive a nearby single spin qubit efficiently. We show that the modulation of exchange coupling is the primary driving force, which successfully reproduces Rabi rates in the tens of MHz range, consistent with experimental data, while also addressing critical aspects related to the optimization of experimental parameters.

AB Precise qubit control in the presence of spatiotemporally correlated noise is pivotal for transitioning to fault-tolerant quantum computing. Generically, such noise can also have non-Gaussian statistics, which hampers existing non-Markovian noise spectroscopy protocols. By utilizing frame-based characterization and a controlbased symmetry analysis, we show how to achieve higher-order spectral estimation for noise-optimized circuit design. Remarkably, we find that the digitally driven qubit dynamics can be solely determined by the complexity of the applied control rather than the nonperturbative nature of the non-Gaussian environment. This enables us to address certain nonperturbative qubit dynamics more simply. We delineate several complexity bounds for learning such high-complexity noise and demonstrate our single- and two-qubit digital characterization and control using a series of numerical simulations. Our results not only provide insights into the exact solvability of (small-size) open quantum dynamics but also highlight a resource-efficient approach for optimal control and possible error-reduction techniques for current qubit devices.

TI 2D Electronic Spectroscopic Techniques for Quantum Technology
   Applications
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY C
AB 2D electronic spectroscopy (2DES) techniques have gained particular interest given their capability of following ultrafast coherent and noncoherent processes in real-time. Although the fame of 2DES is still majorly linked to the investigation of energy and charge transport in biological light-harvesting complexes, 2DES is now starting to be recognized as a particularly valuable tool for studying transport processes in artificial nanomaterials and nanodevices. Particularly meaningful is the possibility of assessing coherent mechanisms active in the transport of excitation energy in these materials toward possible quantum technology applications. The diverse nature of these new target samples poses significant challenges and calls for a critical rethinking of the technique and its different realizations. With the confluence of promising new applications and rapidly developing technical capabilities, the enormous potential of 2DES techniques to impact the field of nanosystems, quantum technologies, and quantum devices is here delineated.

TI Transformer models for quantum gate set tomography
SO QUANTUM MACHINE INTELLIGENCE
AB Quantum computation represents a promising frontier in the domain of high-performance computing, blending quantum information theory with practical applications to overcome the limitations of classical computation. This study investigates the challenges of manufacturing high-fidelity and scalable quantum processors. Quantum gate set tomography (QGST) is a critical method for characterizing quantum processors and understanding their operational capabilities and limitations. This paper introduces Ml4Qgst as a novel approach to QGST by integrating machine learning techniques, specifically utilizing a transformer neural network model. Adapting the transformer model for QGST addresses the computational complexity of modeling quantum systems. Advanced training strategies, including data grouping and curriculum learning, are employed to enhance model performance, demonstrating significant congruence with ground-truth values. We benchmark this training pipeline on the constructed learning model, to successfully perform QGST for 2 and 3 gates on single-qubit and two-qubit systems, with over-rotation error and depolarizing noise estimation with comparable accuracy to pyGSTi. This research marks a pioneering step in applying deep neural networks to the complex problem of quantum gate set tomography, showcasing the potential of machine learning to tackle nonlinear tomography challenges in quantum computing.

TI Energy levels estimation on a quantum computer by evolution of a
   physical quantity
SO PHYSICS LETTERS A
AB We show that the time dependence of mean value of a physical quantity is related with the transition energies of a quantum system. We also find that studies of evolution of mean value of operator anticommuting with Hamiltonian of a system allow to detect directly its energy levels. On the basis of the obtained results, we propose a method for detecting energy levels of physical systems on a quantum computer by evolution of a physical quantity. The method opens a possibility to achieve quantum supremacy in solving the problem of finding minimal or maximal energy of Ising model with spatially anisotropic interaction using multi-qubit quantum computers. We apply the method for finding energy levels of spin systems (spin in magnetic field, spin chain, Ising model on squared lattice) and realize it on IBM's quantum computers. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V.

TI Quantum computation of dominant products in lithium-sulfur batteries
SO JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL PHYSICS
AB Quantum chemistry simulations of some industrially relevant molecules are reported, employing variational quantum algorithms for near-term quantum devices. The energies and dipole moments are calculated along the dissociation curves for lithium hydride (LiH), hydrogen sulfide, lithium hydrogen sulfide, and lithium sulfide. In all cases, we focus on the breaking of a single bond to obtain information about the stability of the molecular species being investigated. We calculate energies and a variety of electrostatic properties of these molecules using classical simulators of quantum devices, with up to 21 qubits for lithium sulfide. Moreover, we calculate the ground-state energy and dipole moment along the dissociation pathway of LiH using IBM quantum devices. This is the first example, to the best of our knowledge, of dipole moment calculations being performed on quantum hardware.

TI Experimental demonstration of continuous-variable
   measurement-device-independent quantum key distribution over optical
   fiber
SO OPTICA
AB Measurement-device-independent quantum key distribution (MDI-QKD) can remove all side-channel attacks on detectors. In the context of the dramatic progress of discrete-variable MDI-QKD and twin-field QKD, owing to the critical challenge of continuous-variable (CV) Bell-state measurement (BSM) of two remote independent quantum states, experimental demonstration of CV-MDI-QKD over optical fiber has remained elusive. To solve this problem, a technology forCV-BSM of remote independent quantum states is developed that consists of optical phase locking, phase estimation, real-time phase feedback, and quadrature remapping in the present work. With this technology, CV-BSM is accurately implemented, and the firstCV-MDI-QKDover optical fiber is demonstrated, to our knowledge. The achieved secret key rates are 0.43 (0.19) bits per pulse over a 5-km (10-km) optical fiber. Our work shows that it is feasible to build a CV-MDI-QKD system over optical fiber. Further, the results pave the way towards realization of a high secret key rate and low-cost metropolitan MDI-QKD network, and serve as a stepping stone to a CV quantum repeater.

TI Strategies for the determination of the running coupling of
   (2+1)-dimensional QED with quantum computing
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW D
AB We propose to utilize noisy-intermediate-scale-quantum-era quantum devices to compute short distance quantities in (2 + 1)-dimensional QED and to combine them with large volume Monte Carlo simulations and perturbation theory. On the quantum computing side, we perform a calculation of the mass gap in the small and intermediate regime, demonstrating, in the latter case, that it can be resolved reliably. The so obtained mass gap can be used to match corresponding results from Monte Carlo simulations, which can be used eventually to set the physical scale. In this paper we provide the setup for the quantum computation and show results for the mass gap and the plaquette expectation value. In addition, we discuss some ideas that can be applied to the computation of the running coupling. Since the theory is asymptotically free, it would serve as a training ground for future studies of QCD in 3 + 1 dimensions on quantum computers.

TI Approximate real-time evolution operator for potential with one
   ancillary qubit and application to first-quantized Hamiltonian
   simulation
SO QUANTUM INFORMATION PROCESSING
AB In many quantum algorithms, including Hamiltonian simulation, efficient quantum circuit implementation of diagonal unitary matrices is an important issue. For small unitary diagonal matrices, a method based on Walsh operators is known and allows an exact implementation. Whereas, as the matrix size increases, the required resources increase linearly regarding the matrix size, so an efficient approximate implementation is indispensable. In this study, we specify the approximation using piecewise polynomials when the diagonal unitary matrix is generated by a known underlying function. It accelerates the implementation by an exponential factor compared to the exact one. In more detail, we modify a previous method, which we call PPP (phase gate for piecewise-defined polynomial), and propose a novel one called LIU (linearly interpolated unitary diagonal matrix). By introducing a coarse-graining parameter, calculated from the underlying function and the desired error bound, we evaluate the explicit gate counts for different methods as functions of some norms of the given function, the grid parameter, and the allowable error. It helps us to figure out the efficient quantum circuits in practical settings of different grid parameters and error bounds, in addition to an asymptotic speedup when the grid parameter goes to infinity. As an application, we apply our method to the first-quantized Hamiltonian simulation and estimate the quantum resources (gate count and ancillary qubits). It reveals that the error coming from the approximation of the potential function is not negligible compared to the error from the Trotter-Suzuki formula.

TI Towards efficient quantum computing for quantum chemistry: reducing
   circuit complexity with transcorrelated and adaptive ansatz techniques
SO FARADAY DISCUSSIONS
AB The near-term utility of quantum computers is hindered by hardware constraints in the form of noise. One path to achieving noise resilience in hybrid quantum algorithms is to decrease the required circuit depth - the number of applied gates - to solve a given problem. This work demonstrates how to reduce circuit depth by combining the transcorrelated (TC) approach with adaptive quantum ans & auml;tze and their implementations in the context of variational quantum imaginary time evolution (AVQITE). The combined TC-AVQITE method is used to calculate ground state energies across the potential energy surfaces of H4, LiH, and H2O. In particular, H4 is a notoriously difficult case where unitary coupled cluster theory, including singles and doubles excitations, fails to provide accurate results. Adding TC yields energies close to the complete basis set (CBS) limit while reducing the number of necessary operators - and thus circuit depth - in the adaptive ans & auml;tze. The reduced circuit depth furthermore makes our algorithm more noise-resilient and accelerates convergence. Our study demonstrates that combining the TC method with adaptive ans & auml;tze yields compact, noise-resilient, and easy-to-optimize quantum circuits that yield accurate quantum chemistry results close to the CBS limit.
   Combining the transcorrelated method with adaptive quantum ans & auml;tze in the context of variational quantum imaginary time evolution significantly reduces the necessary circuit depth and width for performing accurate quantum chemistry using quantum computers.

SO QUANTUM SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB We discuss the procedure for obtaining measurement-based implementations of quantum algorithms given by quantum circuit diagrams and how to reduce the required resources needed for a given measurement-based computation. This forms the foundation for quantum computing on photonic systems in the near term. To demonstrate that these ideas are well grounded we present three different problems which are solved by employing a measurement-based implementation of the variational quantum eigensolver algorithm (MBVQE). We show that by utilising native measurement-based gates rather than standard gates, such as the standard controlled not gate (CNOT), measurement-based quantum computations may be obtained that are both shallow and have simple connectivity while simultaneously exhibiting a large expressibility. We conclude that MBVQE has promising prospects for resource states that are not far from what is already available today.

AB Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) offers a secure method for generating cryptographic keys crucial for 6G future networks. It relies on quantum mechanics principles to guarantee protection against potential threats from quantum computers. However, QKD signal is fragile and can be easily degraded by external noise sources. Therefore, integrating QKD into existing networks poses a challenge, as it must seamlessly coexist with classical channels, in optical fiber links utilizing wavelength division multiplexing (WDM). Continuous-variable QKD (CV-QKD), which leverages optical coherent technology, is seen as a promising solution for this integration within current telecom infrastructure. Additionally, Software-Defined Networking (SDN) presents opportunities for enhancing efficiency and facilitating dynamic management in coexistence scenarios. This paper reports key noise sources that degrade CV-QKD performance in coexistence and the parameters contributing to these noise sources such as classical channel (CC) power, separation between CC and quantum channel (QC) and position of QC. We also report strategies for effectively managing coexistence scenarios using SDN. We focus on the coexistence of CV-QKD in presence of classical channels spaced according a 100 GHz ITU-T grid over a 10 km link length, providing guidelines to optimize the performance.

TI Development of NavIC synchronized fully automated inter-building QKD
   framework and demonstration of quantum secured video calling
SO OPTIK
AB Quantum key distribution (QKD) is a revolutionary communication technology that promises ultimate security assurance by exploiting the fundamental principles of quantum mechanics. In this work, we report design and development of a fully automated inter-building QKD framework for generation and distribution of cryptographic keys, securely and seamlessly, by executing weak coherent pulse based BB84 protocol. This framework is experimentally validated by establishing a quantum communication link between two buildings separated by similar to 300 m of free-space atmospheric channel. A novel synchronization technique enabled with indigenous NavIC (IRNSS) constellation is developed and implemented. This QKD system demonstrates generation of secure key rate as high as 300 Kbps with QBER< 3% for mean photon no. per pulse (mu) of 0.15. The intercept-resend eavesdropping attack has been emulated within the system and evaluated during experiment. A novel quantum secured end-to-end encrypted video calling app (QuViC) is also developed and integrated with QKD framework to demonstrate unconditionally secure two-way communication over Ethernet, functioning alongside with quantum communication.

TI Quantum entanglement of fermionic symmetry-enriched quantum critical
   points in one dimension
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
AB Quantum entanglement can be an effective diagnostic tool for probing topological phases protected by global symmetries. Recently, the notion of nontrivial topology in critical systems has been proposed and is attracting growing attention. In this work, as a concrete example, we explore the quantum entanglement properties of fermionic symmetry-enriched quantum critical points by constructing exactly solvable models based on stacked multiple Kitaev chains. We first analytically establish the global phase diagram using entanglement entropy and reveal three topologically distinct gapped phases with different winding numbers, along with three topologically distinct transition lines separating them. Importantly, we unambiguously demonstrate that two transition lines exhibit fundamentally different topological properties despite sharing the same central charge. Specifically, they display nontrivial topological degeneracy in the entanglement spectrum under periodic boundary conditions, thereby generalizing the Li-Haldane bulk-boundary correspondence to a broader class of fermionic symmetryenriched criticality. Additionally, we identify a novel Lifshitz multicritical point at the intersection of the three transition lines, which also exhibits nontrivial topological degeneracy. This work provides a valuable reference for investigating gapless topological phases of matter from the perspective of quantum entanglement.

TI Efficient Decoupling of a Nonlinear Qubit Mode from Its Environment
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW X
AB To control and measure the state of a quantum system, it must necessarily be coupled to external degrees of freedom. This inevitably leads to spontaneous emission via the Purcell effect, photon-induced dephasing from measurement backaction, and errors caused by unwanted interactions with nearby quantum systems. To tackle this fundamental challenge, we make use of the design flexibility of superconducting quantum circuits to form a multimode element-an artificial molecule-with symmetry-protected modes. The proposed circuit consists of three superconducting islands coupled to a central island via Josephson junctions. It exhibits two essential nonlinear modes, one of which is flux insensitive and used as the protected qubit mode. The second mode is flux tunable and serves via a cross-Kerr-type coupling as a mediator to control the dispersive coupling of the qubit mode to the readout resonator. We demonstrate the Purcell protection of the qubit mode by measuring relaxation times that are independent of the mediated dispersive coupling. We show that the coherence of the qubit is not limited by photon-induced dephasing when detuning the mediator mode from the readout resonator and thereby reducing the dispersive coupling. The resulting highly protected qubit, which we refer to as P-mon, with tunable interactions may serve as a basic building block of a scalable quantum processor architecture, in which qubit decoherence is strongly suppressed.

TI High-performance quantum entanglement generation via cascaded
   second-order nonlinear processes
SO NPJ QUANTUM INFORMATION
AB In this paper, we demonstrate the generation of high-performance entangled photon-pairs in different degrees of freedom from a single piece of fiber pigtailed periodically poled LiNbO3 (PPLN) waveguide. We utilize cascaded second-order nonlinear optical processes, i.e., second-harmonic generation (SHG) and spontaneous parametric downconversion (SPDC), to generate photon-pairs. Previously, the performance of the photon-pairs is contaminated by Raman noise photons. Here by fiber-integrating the PPLN waveguide with noise-rejecting filters, we obtain a coincidence-to-accidental ratio (CAR) higher than 52,600 with photon-pair generation and detection rate of 52.36 kHz and 3.51 kHz, respectively. Energy-time, frequency-bin, and time-bin entanglement is prepared by coherently superposing correlated two-photon states in these degrees of freedom, respectively. The energy-time entangled two-photon states achieve the maximum value of CHSH-Bell inequality of S = 2.71 +/- 0.02 with two-photon interference visibility of 95.74 +/- 0.86%. The frequency-bin entangled two-photon states achieve fidelity of 97.56 +/- 1.79% with a spatial quantum beating visibility of 96.85 +/- 2.46%. The time-bin entangled two-photon states achieve the maximum value of CHSH-Bell inequality of S = 2.60 +/- 0.04 and quantum tomographic fidelity of 89.07 +/- 4.35%. Our results provide a potential candidate for the quantum light source in quantum photonics.

AB Variational quantum algorithms are suitable for use on noisy quantum systems. One of the most important use-cases is the quantum simulation of materials, using the variational quantum eigensolver (VQE). To optimize VQE performance, a suitable parameterized quantum circuit (ansatz) must be selected. We investigate a class of ansatze that incorporates knowledge of the quantum hardware, namely the hardware efficient ansatze. The performance of hardware efficient ansatze is affected differently by noise, and our goal is to study the effect of noise on evaluating which ansatz gives more accurate results in practice. First, we study the effect of noise on the different hardware efficient ansatze by benchmarking and ranking the performance of each ansatz family (i) on a chemistry application using VQE and (ii) by the recently established metric of "expressibility". The results demonstrate the ranking of optimal circuits does not remain constant in the presence of noise. Second, we evaluate the suitability of the expressibility measure in this context by performing a correlation study between expressibility and the performance of the same circuits on a chemistry application using VQE. Our simulations reveal a weak correlation and therefore demonstrate that expressibility is not an adequate measure to quantify the effectiveness of parameterized quantum circuits for quantum chemistry. Third, we evaluate the effect of different quantum device noise models on the ordering of which ansatz family is best. Interestingly, we see that to decide which ansatz is optimal for use, one needs to consider the specific hardware used even within the same family of quantum hardware.

   third-order nonlinear interactions
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB This work presents a feasible design of an integrated photonic circuit performing as a device for single-qubit preparation and rotations through the third-order nonlinear process of difference frequency generation (DFG) and defined in the temporal mode basis. The first stage of our circuit includes the generation of heralded single photons by spontaneous four-wave mixing in a micro-ring cavity engineered for delivering a single-photon state in a unique temporal mode. The second stage comprises the implementation of DFG in a spiral waveguide with controlled dispersion properties for reaching color qubit preparation fidelity close to unity. We present the generalized rotation operator related to the DFG process, a methodology for the device design, and qubit preparation fidelity results as a function of user-accessible parameters.

TI State transfer with separable optical beams and variational quantum
   algorithms with classical light
SO JOURNAL OF THE OPTICAL SOCIETY OF AMERICA B-OPTICAL PHYSICS
AB Classical electromagnetic fields and quantum mechanics obey the principle of superposition alike. This opens up many avenues for simulation of a large variety of phenomena and algorithms, which have hitherto been considered quantum mechanical. In this paper, we propose two such applications. In the first, we introduce a new, to the best of our knowledge, class of beams, called "equivalent optical beams," in parallel with equivalent states introduced in Phys. Rev. A 89, 062110 (2014). These beams have the same information content for all practical purposes. Employing them, we show how to transfer information from one degree of freedom of classical light to another, without need for classically entangled beams. Next, we show that quantum machine learning can be performed with OAM beams through the implementation of a quantum classifier circuit. We provide explicit protocols and explore the possibility of their experimental realization. (C) 2021 Optical Society of America

TI Operation of a high-frequency, phase-slip qubit
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Aluminum-based Josephson junctions are currently the main sources of nonlinearity for control and manipulation of superconducting qubits. A constriction-based junction provides an alternative source of nonlinearity that promises new types of protected qubits and the possibility of high-temperature and high-frequency operation through the use of superconductors with larger energy gaps. Junctions made from such superconductors have been challenging to incorporate into superconducting qubits because of difficulty controlling junction parameters and have had extremely low lifetimes, which limited their utility. Here we demonstrate that junctions made using titanium nitride (TiN) are a promising and controllable qubit platform. We use TiN junctions to build superconducting qubits based on quantum phase slips through the junction. We operate the qubit at zero flux where the qubit frequency (similar to 17GHz) is mainly determined by the inductance of the qubit. We perform readout and coherent control of the superconducting qubit, and measure qubit lifetimes >60 mu s. Finally, we demonstrate operation of the qubit at temperatures exceeding 300 mK. Our results add the TiN-based junction as a tool for superconducting quantum information processing and opens avenues for new classes of superconducting qubits.

TI Measurement-induced phase transitions in sparse nonlocal scramblers
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Measurement-induced phase transitions arise due to a competition between the scrambling of quantum information in a many-body system and local measurements. In this work we investigate these transitions in different classes of fast scramblers, systems that scramble quantum information as quickly as is conjectured to be possible-on a timescale proportional to the logarithm of the system size. In particular, we consider sets of deterministic sparse couplings that naturally interpolate between local circuits that slowly scramble information and highly nonlocal circuits that achieve the fast-scrambling limit. We find that circuits featuring sparse nonlocal interactions are able to withstand substantially higher rates of local measurement than circuits with only local interactions, even at comparable gate depths. We also study the quantum error-correcting codes that support the volume-law entangled phase and find that our maximally nonlocal circuits yield codes with nearly extensive contiguous code distance. Use of these sparse, deterministic circuits opens pathways towards the design of noise-resilient quantum circuits and error correcting codes in current and future quantum devices with minimum gate numbers.

TI Developments in the Tensor Network - from Statistical Mechanics to
   Quantum Entanglement
SO JOURNAL OF THE PHYSICAL SOCIETY OF JAPAN
AB Tensor networks (TNs) have become one of the most essential building blocks for various fields of theoretical physics such as condensed matter theory, statistical mechanics, quantum information, and quantum gravity. This review provides a unified description of a series of developments in the TN from the statistical mechanics side. In particular, we begin with the variational principle for the transfer matrix of the 2D Ising model, which naturally leads us to the matrix product state (MPS) and the corner transfer matrix (CTM). We then explain how the CTM can be evolved to such MPS-based approaches as density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) and infinite time-evolved block decimation. We also elucidate that the finite-size DMRG played an intrinsic role for incorporating various quantum information concepts in subsequent developments in the TN. After surveying higher-dimensional generalizations like tensor product states or projected entangled pair states, we describe tensor renormalization groups (TRGs), which are a fusion of TNs and Kadanoff-Wilson type real-space renormalization groups, focusing on their fixed point structures. We then discuss how the difficulty in TRGs for critical systems can be overcome in the tensor network renormalization and the multi-scale entanglement renormalization ansatz.

TI Indefinite causal order for quantum metrology with quantum thermal noise
SO PHYSICS LETTERS A
AB A switched quantum channel with indefinite causal order is studied for the fundamental metrological task of phase estimation on a qubit unitary operator affected by quantum thermal noise. Specific capabilities are reported in the switched channel with indefinite order, not accessible with conventional estimation approaches with definite order. Phase estimation can be performed by measuring the control qubit alone, although it does not actively interact with the unitary process - only the probe qubit doing so. Also, phase estimation becomes possible with a fully depolarized input probe or with an input probe aligned with the rotation axis of the unitary, while this is never possible with conventional approaches. The present study extends to thermal noise, investigations previously carried out with the more symmetric and isotropic qubit depolarizing noise, and it contributes to the timely exploration of properties of quantum channels with indefinite causal order relevant to quantum signal and information processing.

TI Developing and Analyzing the Defect-Based Surface Codes Using
   Optimization Algorithms
SO QUANTUM REPORTS
AB Fault tolerance is crucial for enabling large-scale quantum computations, with surface codes emerging as prominent error correction techniques due to their high error threshold and reliance on nearest-neighbor interactions. Despite the advantages of surface codes, they demand a substantial number of qubits to encode a single logical qubit, making them resource-intensive. Two primary approaches exist to encode multiple logical qubits: patch-based and defect-based. This study focuses on the latter approach, which involves creating holes in the surface code for logical qubit encoding. With the defect-based approach, we need to account for trade-offs between the number of logical qubits and the logical error rates, so we employ an optimization algorithm to evaluate the maximum number of logical qubits for a given error rate. Through a series of experiments, we assess the limitations of the defect-based approach and investigate the impact of various hole types on logical qubit encoding.

TI Quantumness of channels
SO QUANTUM INFORMATION PROCESSING
AB The reliability of quantum channels for transmitting information is of profound importance from the perspective of quantum information. This naturally leads to the question as how well a quantum state is preserved when subjected to a quantum channel. We propose a measure of quantumness of channels based on non-commutativity of quantum states that is intuitive and easy to compute. We apply the proposed measure to some well-known noise channels, both Markovian and non-Markovian, and find that the results are in good agreement with those from a recently introduced l1-norm coherence based measure.

AB The importance of quantum-key-distribution (QKD) networks is growing rapidly, not only because the underlying QKD protocol is immune against any (known or unknown) attacks but also as these infrastructures can be operated in a hybrid mode, together with emerging quantum safe, or post quantum cryptography (PQC), public key protocols. Hybrid solutions appear to be the most promising remedy against real-world security risks, posed by prospective quantum computers. Simultaneously, telecommunication operators are embracing novel network paradigms, such as software-defined networking (SDN), due to distinct advantages over traditional approaches. SDN-inspired architectures can also be used for QKD and hybrid QKD-PQC networks. These architectures allow a seamless integration of QKD and hybrid QKD-PQC into production networks, significantly increasing the security of the latter. However, there has only been very limited research on optimal strategies for establishing hybrid connectivity across different organizational domains. The present contribution introduces two methods on interconnecting different technological and administrative domains for such networks. The proposed scheme is QKD-vendor independent and relies heavily on standard and open interfaces. It enables a complete end-to-end communication between applications running on nodes in different domains. It can be used for the secure interconnection of different SDN-based telecommunication domains with additional QKD / hybrid protection and has been tested within the Madrid QuantumCommunication Infrastructure.

We demonstrate that the degree of entanglement in a bipartite ion + photoelectron system, and, as a consequence, the degree of vibrational coherence in the ion, can be controlled by tailoring the spectral properties of the attosecond extreme ultraviolet laser pulses that are used to create them.

TI Emergence of monogamy under static and dynamic scenarios
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Characterizing multipartite quantum correlations beyond two parties is of utmost importance for building cutting edge quantum technologies, although the comprehensive picture is still missing. Here we investigate quantum correlations (QCs) present in a multipartite system by exploring connections between magentathree different frameworks, namely, the monogamy score (MS), localizable quantum correlations (LQC), and genuine multipartite entanglement (GME) content of the state. We find that the frequency distribution of GME for Dicke states with higher excitations resembles that of random states. We show that there is a critical value of GME beyond which all states become monogamous and it is investigated by considering different powers of MS which provides various layers of monogamy relations. Interestingly, such a relationship between LQC and MS as well as GME does not hold. States having a very low GME (low monogamy score, both positive and negative) can localize a high amount of QCs in two parties. We also provide an upper bound to the sum of bipartite QC measures including LQC for random states and establish a gap between the actual upper bound and the algebraic maximum.

TI Do qubits dream of entangled sheep? Quantum measurement without
   classical output
SO NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB Quantum mechanics is usually formulated with an implicit assumption that agents who can observe and interact with the world are external to it and have a classical memory. However, there is no accepted way to define the quantum-classical cut and no a priori reason to rule out fully quantum agents with coherent quantum memories. In this work, we introduce an entirely quantum notion of measurement, called a sensation, to account for quantum agents that experience the world through quantum sensors. Sensations eschew probabilities and instead describe a deterministic flow of quantum information. We quantify the information gain and disturbance of a sensation using concepts from quantum information theory and find that sensations always disturb at least as much as they inform. Viewing measurements as sensations could lead to a new understanding of quantum theory in general and to new results in the context of quantum networks.

SO QUANTUM SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB We report on the preparation of a large quantum register of 5612 qubits, with the unprecedented high global fidelity of F similar or equal to 0.9956. This was achieved by applying an improved cooperative quantum information erasure protocol (Buffoni and Campisi 2023 Quantum 7 961) to a programmable network of superconducting qubits featuring a high connectivity. At variance with the standard method based on the individual reset of each qubit in parallel, here the quantum register is treated as a whole, thus avoiding the well-known orthogonality catastrophe whereby even an extremely high individual reset fidelity f results in vanishing global fidelities F=fN with growing number N of qubits.

TI Constructive feedback of non-Markovianity on resources in random quantum
   states
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB We explore the impact of non-Markovian channels on the quantum correlations of Haar uniformly generated random two-qubit input states with different ranks: Either one of the qubits (single-sided channel) or both qubits independently (double-sided channel) are passed through a noisy channel. For dephasing and depolarizing channels with varying non-Markovian strength, entanglement and quantum discord of the output states collapse and revive with the increase of noise. By both analytical and numerical means, we find that in the case of the depolarizing double-sided channel, entanglement and quantum discord for random states show a higher number of revivals on average than for single-sided channels with a fixed non-Markovianity strength, irrespective of the rank of the states; we call such a counterintuitive event, constructive feedback of non-Markovianity. In contrast, the mean value of critical noise at which quantum correlations (QCs) first collapse decreases with the increase of non-Markovianity, independently of the rank of the random initial states. However, the average noise at which QCs of random states show the first revival decreases with the increase of the strength of non-Markovian noise, thereby indicating the role of non-Markovian channels in the regeneration of QCs even in the presence of a high amount of noise. Moreover, we observe that the tendency of a state to show regeneration increases with the increase of average QCs of the random input states along with non-Markovianity.

TI An operating system for executing applications on quantum network nodes
SO NATURE
AB The goal of future quantum networks is to enable new internet applications that are impossible to achieve using only classical communication1, 2-3. Up to now, demonstrations of quantum network applications4, 5-6 and functionalities7, 8, 9, 10, 11-12 on quantum processors have been performed in ad hoc software that was specific to the experimental setup, programmed to perform one single task (the application experiment) directly into low-level control devices using expertise in experimental physics. Here we report on the design and implementation of an architecture capable of executing quantum network applications on quantum processors in platform-independent high-level software. We demonstrate the capability of the architecture to execute applications in high-level software by implementing it as a quantum network operating system-QNodeOS-and executing test programs, including a delegated computation from a client to a server13 on two quantum network nodes based on nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centres in diamond14,15. We show how our architecture allows us to maximize the use of quantum network hardware by multitasking different applications. Our architecture can be used to execute programs on any quantum processor platform corresponding to our system model, which we illustrate by demonstrating an extra driver for QNodeOS for a trapped-ion quantum network node based on a single 40Ca+ atom16. Our architecture lays the groundwork for computer science research in quantum network programming and paves the way for the development of software that can bring quantum network technology to society.

TI A Beam Search Framework for Quantum Circuit Mapping
SO ENTROPY
AB In the era of noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) computing, the limited connectivity between qubits is one of the common physical limitations faced by current quantum computing devices. Quantum circuit mapping methods transform quantum circuits into equivalent circuits that satisfy physical connectivity constraints by remapping logical qubits, making them executable. The optimization problem of quantum circuit mapping has NP-hard computational complexity, and existing heuristic mapping algorithms still have significant potential for optimization in terms of the number of quantum gates generated. To reduce the number of SWAP gates inserted during mapping, the solution space of the mapping problem is represented as a tree structure, and the mapping process is equivalent to traversing this tree structure. To effectively and efficiently complete the search process, a beam search framework (BSF) is proposed for solving quantum circuit mapping. By iteratively selecting, expanding, and making decisions, high-quality target circuits are generated. Experimental results show that this method can significantly reduce the number of inserted SWAP gates on medium to large circuits, achieving an average reduction of 44% compared to baseline methods, and is applicable to circuits of various sizes and complexities.

   Spin Qudit in Diamond
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB A high-spin nucleus coupled to a color center can act as a long-lived memory qudit in a spin-photon interface. The germanium vacancy (GeV) in diamond has attracted recent attention due to its excellent spectral properties and provides access to the ten-dimensional Hilbert space of the I = 9/2 73Ge nucleus. Here, we observe the 73GeV hyperfine structure, perform nuclear spin readout, and optically initialize the 73Ge spin into any eigenstate on a mu s timescale and with a fidelity of up to -84%. Our results establish 73GeV as an optically addressable high-spin quantum platform for a high-efficiency spin-photon interface as well as for foundational quantum physics and metrology.

TI Simulated quantum annealing as a simulator of nonequilibrium quantum
   dynamics
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Simulated quantum annealing based on the path-integral Monte Carlo is one of the most common tools to simulate quantum annealing on classical hardware. Nevertheless, it is in principle highly nontrivial whether or not this classical algorithm can correctly reproduce the quantum dynamics of quantum annealing, particularly in the diabatic regime. We study this problem numerically through the generalized Kibble-Zurek mechanism of defect distribution in the simplest ferromagnetic one-dimensional transverse-field Ising model with and without coupling to the environment. We find that, in the absence of coupling to the environment, simulated quantum annealing correctly describes the annealing-time dependence of the average number of defects, but a detailed analysis of the defect distribution shows clear deviations from the theoretical prediction. When the system is open (coupled to the environment), the average number of defects does not follow the theoretical prediction but is qualitatively compatible with the numerical result by the infinite-time-evolving block decimation combined with the quasiadiabatic propagator path integral, which is valid in a very-short-time region. The distribution of defects in the open system turns out to be not far from the theoretical prediction. It is surprising that the classical stochastic dynamics of simulated quantum annealing ostensibly reproduces some aspects of the quantum dynamics. However, a serious problem is that it is hard to predict for which physical quantities in which system it is reliable. Those results suggest the necessity to exert a good amount of caution in using simulated quantum annealing to study the detailed quantitative aspects of the dynamics of quantum annealing.

TI Compilation of Trotter-Based Time Evolution for Partially Fault-Tolerant
   Quantum Computing Architecture
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB Achieving practical quantum speedup with limited resources is a crucial challenge in both academic and industrial communities. To address this, a partially fault-tolerant quantum computing architecture called "space-time efficient analog rotation quantum computing architecture" (STAR architecture) been recently been proposed. This architecture focuses on minimizing resource requirements while maximizing the precision of non-Clifford gates, essential for universal quantum computation. However, nondeterministic processes such as the repeat-until-success (RUS) protocol and state injection can introduce significant computational overhead. Therefore, optimizing the logical circuit to minimize this overhead by using efficient fault-tolerant operations is essential. This paper presents an efficient method for simulating the time evolution of the two-dimensional (2D) Hubbard-model Hamiltonian, a promising application of the STAR architecture. We present two techniques, the parallel-injection protocol and adaptive injectionregion updating, to reduce unnecessary time overhead specific to our architecture. By integrating these with the existing fermionic SWAP (fSWAP) technique, we develop an efficient Trotter-based time-evolution operation for the 2D Hubbard model. Our analysis reveals an acceleration of over 10 times compared to naive serial compilation. Based on this optimized compilation, we estimate the computational resources required for the quantum phase estimation of the 2D Hubbard model. For devices with a physical error rate of pphys = 10-4, we estimate that approximately 6.2 x 104 physical qubits are required to achieve faster ground-state energy estimation of the 8 x 8 Hubbard model compared to classical computation.

TI Ultrafast superconducting qubit readout with the quarton coupler
SO SCIENCE ADVANCES
AB Fast, high-fidelity, and quantum nondemolition (QND) qubit readout is an essential element of quantum information processing. For superconducting qubits, state-of-the-art readout is based on a dispersive cross-Kerr coupling between a qubit and its readout resonator. The resulting readout can be high fidelity and QND, but readout times are currently limited to the order of 50 nanoseconds due to the dispersive cross-Kerr of magnitude 10 megahertz. Here, we present a readout scheme that uses the quarton coupler to facilitate a large (greater than 200 megahertz) cross-Kerr between a transmon qubit and its readout resonator. Full master equation simulations of the coupled system show a 5-nanosecond readout time with greater than 99% readout fidelity and greater than 99.9% QND fidelity. The quartonic readout circuit is experimentally feasible and preserves the coherence properties of the qubit. Our work reveals a path for order of magnitude improvements of superconducting qubit readout by engineering nonlinear light-matter couplings in parameter regimes unreachable by existing designs.

TI Platinum-based catalysts for oxygen reduction reaction simulated with a
   quantum computer
SO NPJ COMPUTATIONAL MATERIALS
AB Hydrogen has emerged as a promising energy source for low-carbon and sustainable mobility purposes. However, its applications are still limited by modest conversion efficiency in the electrocatalytic oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) within fuel cells. The complex nature of the ORR and the presence of strong electronic correlations present challenges to atomistic modelling using classical computers. This scenario opens new avenues for the implementation of novel quantum computing workflows. Here, we present a state-of-the-art study that combines classical and quantum computational approaches to investigate ORR on platinum-based surfaces. Our research demonstrates, for the first time, the feasibility of implementing this workflow on the H1-series trapped-ion quantum computer and identify the challenges of the quantum chemistry modelling of this reaction. The results highlight the great potentiality of quantum computers in solving notoriously difficult systems with strongly correlated electronic structures and suggest platinum/cobalt as ideal candidate for showcasing quantum advantage in future applications.

TI Designing excitonic circuits for the Deutsch-Jozsa algorithm: mitigating
   fidelity loss by merging gate operations
SO PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY CHEMICAL PHYSICS
AB In this manuscript, we examine design strategies for the development of excitonic circuits that are capable of performing simple 2-qubit multi-step quantum algorithms. Specifically, we compare two different strategies for designing dye-based systems that prescribe exciton evolution encoding a particular quantum algorithm. A serial strategy implements the computation as a step-by-step series of circuits, with each carrying out a single operation of the quantum algorithm, and a combined strategy implements the entire computation in a single circuit. We apply these two approaches to the well-studied Deutsch-Jozsa algorithm and evaluate circuit fidelity in an idealized system under a model harmonic bath, and also for a bath that is parameterized to reflect the thermal fluctuations of an explicit molecular environment. We find that the combined strategy tends to yield higher fidelity and that the harmonic bath approximation leads to lower fidelity than a model molecular bath. These results imply that the programming of excitonic circuits for quantum computation should favor hard-coded modules that incorporate multiple algorithmic steps and should represent the molecular nature of the circuit environment.

TI Discrete modulation continuous-variable measurement-deviceindependent
   quantum key distribution scheme based on realistic detector
   compensation*
SO ACTA PHYSICA SINICA
AB Discrete modulation continuous variable measurement device independent quantum key distribution scheme has good compatibility with efficient error correction codes, which leads to high reconciliation efficiency even at low signal-to-noise ratio. Besides, the implementation of this protocol is simpler than that of Gaussian modulation scheme. However, the quantum efficiency of homodyne detector commonly used in the experiment is only 0.6, which will seriously affect the practical application performance of discrete modulation continuous variable measurement device independent quantum key distribution scheme. To solve this problem, we propose a discrete modulation continuous variable measurement device independent quantum key distribution scheme based on realistic detector compensation. In our scheme, for the outputs of two quantum channels, each adopts a phase sensitive amplifier to compensate for the corresponding realistic homodyne detector. The simulation results show that the phase sensitive amplifier can well compensate for the quantum efficiency of the realistic detector and effectively improve the performance of the discrete modulation continuous variable measurement device independent quantum key distribution scheme with realistic detector in terms of secret key rate and secure transmission distance. The proposed protocol provides an effective method for promoting the practical development of the discrete modulation continuous variable measurement device independent quantum key distribution scheme.

AB The particle-wave duality of the electron poses a principle question of whether the spin is a property of the particle or the wave. In this paper, the wave nature of the spin is studied for an electron inside a two-dimensional quantum well. By solving the exact 4 - spinor eigen solution to the Dirac equation, we show that a stable circulating total current density exists inside the well with a donut shaped topography. A spin value is modified by the confining geometry of the well. Our analysis also shows that a free electron Gaussian wavepacket is unstable and experiences quick decoherence.

AB We demonstrate a method of qubit state preparation and measurement (SPAM) based on a weakly open quantum channel that achieves a higher fidelity than previous demonstrations, even with low detection efficiency. -0.4 x 10-4) is limited by setup-specific errors from ion loss and imperfect population transfer between qubit eigenstates, and we show that full transfer would yield an inaccuracy less than 8 x 10-5. The high precision of this method revealed errors caused by a rare (approximate to 10-4 likelihood) magnetic-dipole decay that we measure and correct by driving an additional transition. Since this scheme allows fluorescence collection for effectively unlimited periods, high fidelity is achievable even with limited optical access and low quantum efficiency photon detectors.

TI General Inverse Problem Solution for Two-Level Systems and Its
   Application to Charge Transfer
SO PHYSICS
AB Two-level quantum systems are building blocks of quantum technologies, where the qubit is the basic unit of quantum information. The ability to design driving fields that produce prespecified evolutions of relevant physical observables is crucial to the development of such technologies. Using vector algebra and recently developed strategies for generating solvable two-level Hamiltonians, we construct the general solution to the inverse problem for a spin in a time-dependent magnetic field and its extension to any two-level system associated with fictitious spin and field. We provide a general expression for the field that drives the dynamics of the system so as to realize prescribed time evolutions of the expectation values of the Pauli operators and the autocorrelation of the Pauli vector. The analysis is applied to two-state charge transfer systems, showing that the charge transfer process can be seen as a motion of the state of the associated fictitious qubit on the Bloch sphere, and that the expectation values of the related Pauli operators describe the interference between the two differently localized electronic states and their population difference. Our formulation is proposed as a basic step towards potential uses of charge transfer in quantum computing and quantum information transfer.

TI Quantum phase transitions in the spin-1 bilinear-biquadratic Heisenberg
   model based on classical and quantum correlations
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB We investigate thermal and non-thermal quantum correlations in the one-dimensional spin-1 bilinear-biquadratic Heisenberg model. Using tools from quantum information theory-such as generalized concurrence, negativity, and various measures of quantum, classical, and total correlations in bipartite states-we demonstrate that these measures effectively identify quantum phase transitions (QPTs) at critical points. Our negativity analysis reveals nearly identical results at zero or very low temperatures. Importantly, we find that partial concurrence, defined with the reduced density matrix \documentclass[12pt]{minimal} \usepackage{amsmath} \usepackage{wasysym} \usepackage{amsfonts} \usepackage{amssymb} \usepackage{amsbsy} \usepackage{mathrsfs} \usepackage{upgreek} \setlength{\oddsidemargin}{-69pt} \begin{document}$$\rho _{1,2}$$\end{document}, detects more quantum critical points than total concurrence. Additionally, we argue that spin chains with an odd number of spins are more effective than those with an even number in identifying QPTs.

TI Macroscopically Nonlocal Quantum Correlations
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB It is usually believed that coarse graining of quantum correlations leads to classical correlations in the macroscopic limit. Such a principle, known as macroscopic locality, has been proved for correlations arising from independent and identically distributed (IID) entangled pairs. In this Letter, we consider the generic (non-IID) scenario. We find that the Hilbert space structure of quantum theory can be preserved in the macroscopic limit. This leads directly to a Bell violation for coarse-grained collective measurements, thus breaking the principle of macroscopic locality.

TI Measuring short range stray electric fields with a force quantum sensor
SO COMPTES RENDUS PHYSIQUE
AB We use a quantum sensor based on trapped atom interferometry, and designed for probing short range atom-surface interactions, to characterize parasitic electric fields produced by adsorbed atoms or surface charges on a dielectric mirror. Applying controlled external fields with in-situ electrodes allows measuring electric field gradients with a relative uncertainty of order of 1% via variations of the force induced onto the atoms. More, our sensor can also be configured as a trapped microwave clock, allowing for direct measurements of the electric field amplitude via the Stark shift of the hyperfine transition frequency. Such measurements of the electric field amplitudes and gradients as a function of the atom-surface distance can be used to construct a model for the spatial distribution of the atoms adsorbed onto the surface of the mirror, and to accurately correct local force measurements, such as related to the Casimir-Polder interaction, from the detrimental impact of adsorbed atoms or stray charges.

AB Passive Optical Networks (PONs) are widely used in fixed-access networks for delivering connectivity to domestic, commercial and industrial users. Authentication and encryption are required in PONs, because of their vulnerability to Optical Network Unit (ONU) impersonating or downstream data sniffing attacks. The research community has pointed out the vulnerabilities of the authentication mechanisms enforced in PON, and has proposed Shared Mutual Authentication (SMA) using PublicKey Cryptography (PKC) based on Diffie-Hellman. However, this last is vulnerable to attacks from quantum computers. This work proposes using Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC) for SMA in Time-Division Multiplexing (TDM)-PONs. Kyber is selected for the proposed SMA mechanism. This algorithm is the finalist in the PQC standardization process of the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). The feasibility of the proposed Kyber SMA mechanism is shown in a simulation, and it is compared against a baseline SMA from the 10-Gigabitcapable Passive Optical Network (XG-PON) and a state-of-theart SMA based on Diffie-Hellman. The proposed Kyber SMA mechanism requires more random bytes, has a longer execution time than the baseline and its overhead is similar to the state-ofthe-art mechanism with similar security features but based on classical cryptography. According to the presented evaluations, the proposed approach is feasible and offers an SMA resistant to threats from traditional and quantum computers.

TI Cost of locally approximating high-dimensional ground states of
   contextual quantum models
SO COMMUNICATIONS PHYSICS
AB Contextuality, one of the strongest forms of quantum correlations, delineates the boundary between the quantum world and the classical one. Recent advances show that some translation-invariant contextuality witnesses are maximally violated by ground states and local observables of infinite one-dimensional translation-invariant Hamiltonians. However, these models all have local Hilbert space dimension larger than two, making the study of their ground states behavior difficult on current qubit-based platforms. In this work, we focus on the cost of simulating their 3-site reduced density matrices using qubit-based parameterized quantum circuits. The local approximations are purified then encoded into permutation-symmetric qubit states. By developing a universal set of permutation-symmetry preserving qubit-based gates, we assess the accuracy of simulating the purified local ground states against fixed classical and quantum resources. Results reveal that more contextual ground states with lower energy density are easier to simulate under identical resources.

TI Construction and the ergodicity properties of dual unitary quantum
   circuits
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
AB We consider one-dimensional quantum circuits of the brickwork type, where the fundamental quantum gate is dual unitary. Such models are solvable: the dynamical correlation functions of the infinite temperature ensemble can be computed exactly. We review various existing constructions for dual unitary gates and we supplement them with new ideas in a number of cases. We discuss connections with various topics in physics and mathematics, including quantum information theory, tensor networks for the AdS/CFT correspondence (holographic error correcting codes), classical combinatorial designs (orthogonal Latin squares), planar algebras, and Yang-Baxter maps. Afterwards we consider the ergodicity properties of a special class of dual unitary models, where the local gate is a permutation matrix. We find an unexpected phenomenon: nonergodic behavior can manifest itself in multisite correlations, even in those cases when the one-site correlation functions are fully chaotic (completely thermalizing). We also discuss the circuits built out of perfect tensors. They appear locally as the most chaotic and most scrambling circuits, nevertheless they can show global signs of nonergodicity: if the perfect tensor is constructed from a linear map over finite fields, then the resulting circuit can show exact quantum revivals at unexpectedly short times. A brief mathematical treatment of the recurrence time in such models is presented in Appendix (written by Roland Bacher and Denis Serre).

TI Layerwise learning for quantum neural networks
SO QUANTUM MACHINE INTELLIGENCE
AB With the increased focus on quantum circuit learning for near-term applications on quantum devices, in conjunction with unique challenges presented by cost function landscapes of parametrized quantum circuits, strategies for effective training are becoming increasingly important. In order to ameliorate some of these challenges, we investigate a layerwise learning strategy for parametrized quantum circuits. The circuit depth is incrementally grown during optimization, and only subsets of parameters are updated in each training step. We show that when considering sampling noise, this strategy can help avoid the problem of barren plateaus of the error surface due to the low depth of circuits, low number of parameters trained in one step, and larger magnitude of gradients compared to training the full circuit. These properties make our algorithm preferable for execution on noisy intermediate-scale quantum devices. We demonstrate our approach on an image-classification task on handwritten digits, and show that layerwise learning attains an 8% lower generalization error on average in comparison to standard learning schemes for training quantum circuits of the same size. Additionally, the percentage of runs that reach lower test errors is up to 40% larger compared to training the full circuit, which is susceptible to creeping onto a plateau during training.

TI Quantum k-community detection: algorithm proposals and
   cross-architectural evaluation
SO QUANTUM INFORMATION PROCESSING
AB Emerging quantum technologies represent a promising alternative for solving hard combinatorial problems in the post-Moore's law era. For practical purposes, however, the current number of qubits limits the direct applicability to larger real-world instances in the near-term future. Therefore, a promising strategy to overcome this issue is represented by hybrid quantum classical algorithms which leverage classical as well as quantum devices. One prominent example of a hard computational problem is the community detection problem: a partition of a graph into distinct communities such that the ratio between intra-community and inter-community connectivity is maximized. In this paper, we explore the current potential of quantum annealing and gate-based quantum technologies to solve the community detection problem for an arbitrary number of communities. For this purpose, existing algorithms are (re-)implemented and new hybrid algorithms, that can be run on gate-model devices, are proposed. Their performance on standardized benchmark graphs has been evaluated and compared to the one of a state-of-the-art classical heuristic algorithm. Although no quantum speed-up has been achieved, the existing quantum annealing-based methods as well as the novel hybrid algorithms for gate-based quantum computers yield modularity values, which are similar to those of the classical heuristic. However, the modular architecture of the used algorithms allows for fast utilization of more powerful quantum technologies once they become available. Reproducibility: Our code and data are publicly available (Github in Quantum Modularization. https://github.com/jku-winse/quantum_modularization 2021).

TI Success-or-Draw: A Strategy Allowing Repeat-Until-Success in Quantum
   Computation
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB The repeat-until-success strategy is a standard method to obtain success with a probability that grows exponentially with the number of iterations. However, since quantum systems are disturbed after a quantum measurement, how to perform repeat-until-success strategies in certain quantum algorithms is not straightforward. In this Letter, we propose a new structure for probabilistic higher-order transformation named success-or-draw, which allows a repeat-until-success implementation. For that we provide a universal construction of success-or-draw structure that works for any probabilistic higher-order transformation on unitary operations. We then present a semidefinite programming approach to obtain optimal success-or-draw protocols and analyze in detail the problem of inverting a general unitary operation.

TI Hybrid Quantum Neural Network for Drug Response Prediction
SO CANCERS
AB Cancer is one of the leading causes of death worldwide. It is caused by various genetic mutations, which makes every instance of the disease unique. Since chemotherapy can have extremely severe side effects, each patient requires a personalized treatment plan. Finding the dosages that maximize the beneficial effects of the drugs and minimize their adverse side effects is vital. Deep neural networks automate and improve drug selection. However, they require a lot of data to be trained on. Therefore, there is a need for machine-learning approaches that require less data. Hybrid quantum neural networks were shown to provide a potential advantage in problems where training data availability is limited. We propose a novel hybrid quantum neural network for drug response prediction based on a combination of convolutional, graph convolutional, and deep quantum neural layers of 8 qubits with 363 layers. We test our model on the reduced Genomics of Drug Sensitivity in Cancer dataset and show that the hybrid quantum model outperforms its classical analog by 15% in predicting IC50 drug effectiveness values. The proposed hybrid quantum machine learning model is a step towards deep quantum data-efficient algorithms with thousands of quantum gates for solving problems in personalized medicine, where data collection is a challenge.

TI Spin-encoded quantum computer near ultimate physical limits
SO QUANTUM INFORMATION PROCESSING
AB Landauer's bound is applicable to irreversible quantum operations. In this study, we showcased that the Doppler temperature manifests the existence of Landauer's bound, which does not block a spin from (irreversibly) flipping with a tiny amount of energy via quantum tunneling. Verified by a spin-spin magnetic interaction experiment, this (energy) amount was determined to be only 1.25 times the theoretical value of Landauer's bound. Based on Heisenberg's principle, we defined information from a measuring perspective: one bit of information corresponds to the smallest error when quantifying the product of the measured energy uncertainty ( Delta E \documentclass[12pt]{minimal} \usepackage{amsmath} \usepackage{wasysym} \usepackage{amsfonts} \usepackage{amssymb} \usepackage{amsbsy} \usepackage{mathrsfs} \usepackage{upgreek} \setlength{\oddsidemargin}{-69pt} \begin{document}$$\Delta E$$\end{document} ) and the measured time duration ( Delta t \documentclass[12pt]{minimal} \usepackage{amsmath} \usepackage{wasysym} \usepackage{amsfonts} \usepackage{amssymb} \usepackage{amsbsy} \usepackage{mathrsfs} \usepackage{upgreek} \setlength{\oddsidemargin}{-69pt} \begin{document}$$\Delta t$$\end{document} ). We then illustrate an optically manipulated, spin-encoded, near-Landauer-bound, near-Heisenberg-limit quantum computer that encompasses this new definition of information. This study may represent the last piece of the puzzle in understanding both quantum Landauer erasure and Heisenberg's quantum limit since a single spin is the smallest information carrier.

AB The security of the digital certificates used in authenticating network devices relies on cryptographic algorithms like the RSA and ECC, which are vulnerable to quantum attacks. This study addresses the urgent need to secure the Simple Certificate Enrollment Protocol (SCEP), widely used in PKI-based systems, by integrating post-quantum cryptographic (PQC) algorithms-Dilithium, Falcon, and SPHINCS+. The experimental results show that Dilithium2 (1312 bytes) and Falcon512 (897 bytes) offer the best performance and throughput, with Falcon512 also being the most efficient in terms of the storage consumption. This research represents the first integration of PQC algorithms into the SCEP, establishing a foundation for scalable, quantum-resilient certificate enrollment in future PKI systems.

TI Adaptive Variational Quantum Computing Approaches for Green's Functions
   and Nonlinear Susceptibilities
SO JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL THEORY AND COMPUTATION
AB We present and benchmark quantum computing approaches for calculating real-time single-particle Green's functions and nonlinear susceptibilities of Hamiltonian systems. The approaches leverage adaptive variational quantum algorithms for state preparation and propagation. Using automatically generated compact circuits, the dynamical evolution is performed over sufficiently long times to achieve adequate frequency resolution of the response functions. We showcase accurate Green's function calculations using a statevector simulator on classical hardware for Fermi-Hubbard chains of 4 and 6 sites, with maximal ansatz circuit depths of 65 and 424 layers, respectively, and for the molecule LiH with a maximal ansatz circuit depth of 81 layers. Additionally, we consider an antiferromagnetic quantum spin-1 model that incorporates the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction to illustrate calculations of the third-order nonlinear susceptibilities, which can be measured in two-dimensional coherent spectroscopy experiments. These results demonstrate that real-time approaches using adaptive parametrized circuits to evaluate linear and nonlinear response functions can be feasible with near-term quantum processors.

Rare or hard-to-detect processes at the LHC, such as the production of multiple gauge bosons, become accessible at a TeV muon collider. We present here the prospects of detecting quantum entanglement and the violation of Bell inequalities in H -> ZZ -> 4 & ell; events at a potential future muon collider. We show that the spin density matrix of the Z boson pairs can be reconstructed using the kinematics of the charged leptons from the Z boson decays. Once the density matrix is determined, it is straightforward to obtain the expectation values of various Bell operators and test the quantum entanglement between the Z boson pair. Through a detailed study based on Monte-Carlo simulation, we show that the generalized CGLMP inequality can be maximally violated, and testing Bell inequalities could be established with high significance.

The proposed method fully exploits the entanglement properties of Bell states, uses unitary operations to achieve arbitrary transformations of the four Bell states, and encodes two classical bits into a single Bell state, thus enabling multi- information encoding. Additionally, the participants implement iterative authentication based on a pre-shared key, which means that they use the authentication key obtained from the previous round of communication to verify each other, and each round has a different authentication key. Furthermore, by integrating the NetSquid module into Python to simulate the proposed protocol, the simulation results confirm the feasibility of the protocol. Finally, the security analysis and efficiency comparison demonstrate that our protocol provides satisfactory results using current quantum technology.

Utilizing the principles of quantum mechanics, it improves the computing power of quantum computing. Top developers namely IBM, Rigetti, D -Wave, Qutech and Google have invested greatly in the technology. Nowadays, users can access the quantum computing system publicly over the network in a cloud environment, this system architecture is known as cloud -based quantum computing. However, different developers deliver different architecture and functionality of the system on their platforms. This has indirectly spawned a question of which cloud -based quantum computing platform is a better option based on certain specific requirements by an individual or group. The main objective of this study is to provide a proposed framework using the existing cloud -based service of quantum computing based on previous studies for users with their specific demands.

TI Quantum fuzzy logic for edge detection: A demonstration on NISQ hardware
SO APPLIED SOFT COMPUTING
AB Quantum computing offers the potential to enhance computational efficiency beyond classical methods, but practical implementation remains challenging due to the limitations of Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) hardware, namely, restricted qubit counts, limited connectivity, and the presence of noise and decoherence. This study presents a novel approach to edge detection by leveraging a recently developed Quantum Fuzzy Inference Engine, implemented on a NISQ device. We introduce an optimized quantum circuit for its implementation, reducing qubit requirements and gate depth to improve execution on NISQ hardware. To overcome constraints related to large-scale image processing, a hybrid quantum-classical lookup table approach is employed. Edge detection performance is evaluated on the Berkeley Segmentation Data Set and Benchmarks 500 dataset under different conditions, including classical execution, ideal quantum simulation, noisy quantum simulation, and NISQ hardware calculation. Results demonstrate that the quantum fuzzy logic-based edge detection achieves outcomes comparable to classical methods by using fewer operations, marking a step toward practical quantum-enhanced image processing.

TI Quantum Differential Privacy: An Information Theory Perspective
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INFORMATION THEORY
AB Differential privacy has been an exceptionally successful concept when it comes to providing provable security guarantees for classical computations. More recently, the concept was generalized to quantum computations. While classical computations are essentially noiseless and differential privacy is often achieved by artificially adding noise, near-term quantum computers are inherently noisy and it was observed that this leads to natural differential privacy as a feature. In this work we discuss quantum differential privacy in an information theoretic framework by casting it as a quantum divergence. A main advantage of this approach is that differential privacy becomes a property solely based on the output states of the computation, without the need to check it for every measurement. This leads to simpler proofs and generalized statements of its properties as well as several new bounds for both, general and specific, noise models. In particular, these include common representations of quantum circuits and quantum machine learning concepts. Here, we focus on the difference in the amount of noise required to achieve certain levels of differential privacy versus the amount that would make any computation useless. Finally, we also generalize the classical concepts of local differential privacy, Renyi differential privacy and the hypothesis testing interpretation to the quantum setting, providing several new properties and insights.

TI Qubit-Based Clock Synchronization for QKD Systems Using a Bayesian
   Approach
SO ENTROPY
AB Quantum key distribution (QKD) systems provide a method for two users to exchange a provably secure key. Synchronizing the users' clocks is an essential step before a secure key can be distilled. Qubit-based synchronization protocols directly use the transmitted quantum states to achieve synchronization and thus avoid the need for additional classical synchronization hardware. Previous qubit-based synchronization protocols sacrifice secure key either directly or indirectly, and all known qubit-based synchronization protocols do not efficiently use all publicly available information published by the users. Here, we introduce a Bayesian probabilistic algorithm that incorporates all published information to efficiently find the clock offset without sacrificing any secure key. Additionally, the output of the algorithm is a probability, which allows us to quantify our confidence in the synchronization. For demonstration purposes, we present a model system with accompanying simulations of an efficient three-state BB84 prepare-and-measure protocol with decoy states. We use our algorithm to exploit the correlations between Alice's published basis and mean photon number choices and Bob's measurement outcomes to probabilistically determine the most likely clock offset. We find that we can achieve a 95 percent synchronization confidence in only 4140 communication bin widths, meaning we can tolerate clock drift approaching 1 part in 4140 in this example when simulating this system with a dark count probability per communication bin width of 8 x 10(-4) and a received mean photon number of 0.01.

AB Phase unwrapping is the reconstruction of a phase given its values mod 2 pi. It is an important image processing technique used in synthetic aperture radar interferometry, e.g., in the context of topography and ground deformation. In light of recent quantum algorithm developments for mathematical optimization problems, we explore the usage of gate-based quantum computers and hybrid quantum algorithms to create novel phase unwrapping approaches.

TI Nanoscale electric field imaging with an ambient scanning quantum sensor
   microscope
SO NPJ QUANTUM INFORMATION
AB Nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center in diamond is a promising quantum sensor with remarkably versatile sensing capabilities. While scanning NV magnetometry is well-established, NV electrometry has been so far limited to bulk diamonds. Here we demonstrate imaging external alternating (AC) and direct (DC) electric fields with a single NV at the apex of a diamond scanning tip under ambient conditions. A strong electric field screening effect is observed at low frequencies. We quantitatively measure its frequency dependence and overcome this screening by mechanically oscillating the tip for imaging DC fields. Our scanning NV electrometry achieved an AC E-field sensitivity of 26 mV mu m(-1) Hz(-1/2), a DC E-field gradient sensitivity of 2 V mu m(-2) Hz(-1/2), and sub-100 nm resolution limited by the NV-sample distance. Our work represents an important step toward building a scanning-probe-based multimodal quantum sensing platform.

TI Evolution of quantum coherence of qutrit-qutrit system under correlated
   depolarizing channels
SO ACTA PHYSICA SINICA
AB In order to study the decoherence process of quantum system and find the ways to delay it, in this paperwe investigate the decoherence process under correlated depolarizing channels by calculating the evolution ofnorm coherence, relative entropy coherence and basis-independent coherence of the three initial states: specialinitial state, maximum coherent state and isotropic state. From the analytic results, numerical results andevolution images, it can be found that 1) completely correlated channels can suppress decoherence to a greatestextent,. 2) the time point at which maximum decoherence occurs is irrelevant to the degree of correlation, butsystem's decoherence evolution behavior depends on it. 3)the correlation of depolarizing channels can reinforcethe collective quantum coherence between subsystems, and an inequality relation of basis-independent coherenceis proved in this system

TI Ultrafast and Electrically Tunable Rabi Frequency in a Germanium Hut
   Wire Hole Spin Qubit
SO NANO LETTERS
AB Hole spin qubits based on germanium (Ge) have strong tunable spin-orbit interaction (SOI) and ultrafast qubit operation speed. Here we report that the Rabi frequency (f Rabi) of a hole spin qubit in a Ge hut wire (HW) double quantum dot (DQD) is electrically tuned through the detuning energy (6) and middle gate voltage (VM). fRabi gradually decreases with increasing 6; on the contrary, f Rabi is positively correlated with VM. We attribute our results to the change of electric field on SOI and the contribution of the excited state in quantum dots to fRabi. We further demonstrate an ultrafast f Rabi exceeding 1.2 GHz, which indicates the strong SOI in our device. The discovery of an ultrafast and electrically tunable fRabi in a hole spin qubit has potential applications in semiconductor quantum computing.

TI Roadmap on atomic-scale semiconductor devices
SO NANO FUTURES
AB Spin states in semiconductors provide exceptionally stable and noise-resistant environments for qubits, positioning them as optimal candidates for reliable quantum computing technologies. The proposal to use nuclear and electronic spins of donor atoms in silicon, introduced by Kane in 1998, sparked a new research field focused on the precise positioning of individual impurity atoms for quantum devices, utilising scanning tunnelling microscopy and ion implantation. This roadmap article reviews the advancements in the 25 years since Kane's proposal, the current challenges, and the future directions in atomic-scale semiconductor device fabrication and measurement. It covers the quest to create a silicon-based quantum computer and expands to include diverse material systems and fabrication techniques, highlighting the potential for a broad range of semiconductor quantum technological applications. Key developments include phosphorus in silicon devices such as single-atom transistors, arrayed few-donor devices, one- and two-qubit gates, three-dimensional architectures, and the development of a toolbox for future quantum integrated circuits. The roadmap also explores new impurity species like arsenic and antimony for enhanced scalability and higher-dimensional spin systems, new chemistry for dopant precursors and lithographic resists, and the potential for germanium-based devices. Emerging methods, such as photon-based lithography and electron beam manipulation, are discussed for their disruptive potential. This roadmap charts the path toward scalable quantum computing and advanced semiconductor quantum technologies, emphasising the critical intersections of experiment, technological development, and theory.

TI Portfolio optimization based on quantum linear algorithm
SO PHYSICA SCRIPTA
AB The rapid development of quantum computation has brought new possibilities to many fields. Especially in finance, quantum computing offers significant advantages. Recently, the portfolio optimization problem has been solved by a quantum algorithm with a mean-variance model with sparse data. However, the mean-variance model does not match the practice, and furthermore, the data is mostly dense. To fill the gap, we propose the Quantum-Enhanced Portfolio Optimization based on the mean-semi-variance model, where the mean-semi-variance model incorporates an optimized risk definition. The algorithm also effectively reduces the time complexity of solving high-dimensional linear systems and achieves sparsity independence.

TI Quantum Computing-From NISQ to PISQ
SO IEEE MICRO
AB Given the impeding timeline of developing good quality quantum processing units, it is the moment to rethink the approach to advance quantum computing research. Rather than waiting for quantum hardware technologies to mature, we need to start assessing in tandem the impact of the occurrence of quantum computing in various scientific fields. However, to this purpose, we need to use a complementary but quite different approach than proposed by the NISQ vision, which is heavily focused on and burdened by the engineering challenges. That is why we propose and advocate the PISQ approach: Perfect Intermediate Scale Quantum computing based on the already known concept of perfect qubits. This will allow researchers to focus much more on the development of new applications by defining the algorithms in terms of perfect qubits and evaluate them on quantum computing simulators that are executed on supercomputers. It is not the long-term solution but will currently allow universities to research on quantum logic and algorithms and companies can already start developing their internal know-how on quantum solutions.

TI Fast, Robust, and Laser-Free Universal Entangling Gates for Trapped-Ion
   Quantum Computing
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW X
AB A novel two-qubit entangling gate for trapped-ion quantum processors is proposed theoretically and demonstrated experimentally. During the gate, double-dressed quantum states are created by applying a phase-modulated continuous driving field. The speed of this quantum gate is an order of magnitude higher than that of previously demonstrated rf controlled two-qubit entangling gates in static magnetic field gradients. At the same time, the field driving the gate dynamically decouples the qubits from amplitude and frequency noise, increasing the qubits' coherence time by 3 orders of magnitude. The gate requires only a single continuous rf field per qubit, making it well suited for scaling a quantum processor to large numbers of qubits. Implementing this entangling gate, we generate the Bell states j Phi & thorn;i andj Psi & thorn;i in less than or equal to -3 % in a static magnetic gradient of only 19.09 T/m. At higher magnetic field gradients, the entangling gate speed can be further improved to match that of laser-based counterparts.

TI Improving the molecular spin qubit performance in zirconium MOF
   composites by mechanochemical dilution and fullerene encapsulation
SO CHEMICAL SCIENCE
AB Enlarging the quantum coherence times and gaining control over quantum effects in real systems are fundamental for developing quantum technologies. Molecular electron spin qubits are particularly promising candidates for realizing quantum information processing due to their modularity and tunability. Still, there is a constant search for tools to increase their quantum coherence times. Here we present how the mechanochemical introduction of active spin qubits in the form of 10% diluted copper(ii)-porphyrins in the diamagnetic PCN-223 and MOF-525 zirconium-MOF polymorph pair can be achieved. Furthermore, the encapsulation of fullerene during the MOF synthesis directs the process exclusively toward the rare PCN-223 framework with a controllable amount of fullerene in the framework channels. In addition to the templating role, the incorporation of fullerene increases the electron spin-lattice and phase-memory relaxation times, T-1 and T-m. Besides decreasing the amount of nuclear spin-bearing solvent guests in the non-activated qubit frameworks, the observed improved relaxation times can be rationalized by modulating the phonon density of states upon fullerene encapsulation.

TI Quantum K-means clustering method for detecting heart disease using
   quantum circuit approach
SO SOFT COMPUTING
AB The development of noisy intermediate- scale quantum computers is expected to signify the potential advantages of quantum computing over classical computing. This paper focuses on quantum paradigm usage to speed up unsupervised machine learning algorithms particularly the K-means clustering method. The main approach is to build a quantum circuit that performs the distance calculation required for the clustering process. This proposed technique is a collaboration of data mining techniques with quantum computation. Initially, extracted heart disease dataset is preprocessed and classical K-means clustering performance is evaluated. Later, the quantum concept is applied to the classical approach of the clustering algorithm. The comparative analysis is performed between quantum and classical processing to check performance metrics.

TI Shared-reference-frame-independent continuous-variable quantum key
   distribution
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB The protocol of continuous-variable quantum key distribution based on quadrature modulation of coherent states and heterodyne quadrature detection, which does not rely on sharing either a local oscillator or pilot tones, is proposed. Using unidimensional single-quadrature encoding, we suggest alignment of the measurement bases relying on the asymmetry of the phase-space distribution of the modulated states. By rotating the bases so that the maximum quadrature variance is observed, the remote communicating party can identify the signal quadrature direction. Depending on the coherence time of the signal and the repetition rate of the system, the necessary statistics can be accumulated to minimize misalignment between the preparation and measurement bases. We address the issue of residual bases misalignment in the suggested shared-reference-frame-independent continuous-variable quantum key distribution protocol and show that it is feasible with state-of-the-art techniques. The result paves the way for low-cost and simplified quantum communication schemes, which are independent of any shared phase reference and are therefore immune to potential quantum hacking attacks on the local oscillator or pilot tones.

TI Vibration load compliance of a miniaturized CubeSat quantum
   communication terminal
SO JOURNAL OF VIBRATION AND CONTROL
AB CubeSats are a promising platform for the implementation of the space segment in future satellite quantum key distribution constellations. This work demonstrates the design optimization regarding the structural dynamics of the OSIRIS4QUBE quantum communication terminal and the validation of its compliance with launch and operational vibration loads. A representative simulation model is constructed, which allows for the optimization of the system. The goal is to adapt its modal characteristics to isolate it from the resonance of the fine pointing system. Since the modifications are to be decoupled from the optics design, only the printed circuit board, which serves as the optical bench, is adapted. Additionally, customized dampers are used to flatten the response curve of residual vibrations in the critical band. The payload is subjected to a vibration test to validate the simulations and demonstrate the integrity of the fast steering mirror, which revealed a resonance separation factor of 1.28 between the actuator and the optical terminal. In addition, the influence of micro-vibrations from the reaction wheels on the fine pointing mechanism is analyzed. A 3 sigma tracking error of 72 mu rad is measured, proving that the pointing requirements are still met under the most adverse onboard operational conditions.

TI An efficient quantum algorithm for the time evolution of parameterized
   circuits
SO QUANTUM
AB We introduce a novel hybrid algorithm to simulate the real-time evolution of quantum systems using parameterized quantum circuits. The method, named "projected - Variational Quantum Dynamics" (p-VQD) realizes an iterative, global projection of the exact time evolution onto the parameterized manifold. In the small time step limit, this is equivalent to the McLachlan's variational principle. Our approach is efficient in the sense that it exhibits an optimal linear scaling with the total number of variational parameters. Furthermore, it is global in the sense that it uses the variational principle to optimize all parameters at once. The global nature of our approach then significantly extends the scope of existing efficient variational methods, that instead typically rely on the iterative optimisation of a restricted subset of variational parameters. Through numerical experiments, we also show that our approach is particularly advantageous over existing global optimisation algorithms based on the time-dependent variational principle that, due to a demanding quadratic scaling with parameter numbers, are unsuitable for large parameterized quantum circuits.

TI Quantum Photonic Interface for Tin-Vacancy Centers in Diamond
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW X
AB The realization of quantum networks critically depends on establishing efficient, coherent light-matter interfaces. Optically active spins in diamond have emerged as promising quantum nodes based on their spin-selective optical transitions, long-lived spin ground states, and potential for integration with nanophotonics. Tin-vacancy (SnV-) centers in diamond are of particular interest because they exhibit narrow-linewidth emission in nanostructures and possess long spin coherence times at temperatures above 1 K. However, a nanophotonic interface for SnV- centers has not yet been realized. Here, we report cavity enhancement of the emission of SnV- centers in diamond. We integrate SnV- centers into one-dimensional photonic crystal resonators and observe a 40-fold increase in emission intensity. The Purcell factor of the coupled system is 25, resulting in a channeling of the majority of photons (90%) into the cavity mode. Our results pave the way for the creation of efficient, scalable spin-photon interfaces based on SnV- centers in diamond.

TI Autoparametric Resonance Extending the Bit-Flip Time of a Cat Qubit up
   to 0.3 s
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW X
AB Cat qubits, for which logical |0 > and |1 > are coherent states |+/- alpha > of a harmonic mode, offer a promising route towards quantum error correction. Using dissipation to our advantage so that photon pairs of the harmonic mode are exchanged with single photons of its environment, it is possible to stabilize the logical states and exponentially increase the bit-flip time of the cat qubit with the photon number |alpha|(2). A large twophoton dissipation rate kappa(2) ensures fast qubit manipulation and short error-correction cycles, which are instrumental to correct the remaining phase-flip errors in a repetition code of cat qubits. Here, we introduce and operate an autoparametric superconducting circuit that couples a mode containing the cat qubit to a lossy mode whose frequency is set at twice that of the cat mode. This passive coupling does not require a parametric pump, and it reaches a rate kappa(2)/2 pi approximate to 2 MHz. With such a strong two-photon dissipation, bit-flip errors of the autoparametric cat qubit are prevented for a characteristic time up to 0.3 s with only a mild impact on phase-flip errors. In addition, we illustrate how the phase of a quantum superposition between |a > and |- alpha > can be arbitrarily changed by driving the harmonic mode while keeping the engineered dissipation active.

TI Absorption in Invariant Domains for Semigroups of Quantum Channels
SO ANNALES HENRI POINCARE
AB We introduce a notion of absorption operators in the context of quantum Markov processes. The absorption problem in invariant domains (enclosures) is treated for a quantum Markov evolution on a separable Hilbert space, both in discrete and continuous times: We define a well-behaving set of positive operators which can correspond to classical absorption probabilities, and we study their basic properties, in general, and with respect to accessibility structure of channels, transience and recurrence. In particular, we can prove that no accessibility is allowed between the null and positive recurrent subspaces. In the case, when the positive recurrent subspace is attractive, ergodic theory will allow us to get additional results, in particular about the description of fixed points.

TI Spatially Resolved Event-Driven 24 x 24 Pixels SPAD Imager With 100%
   Duty Cycle for Low Optical Power Quantum Entanglement Detection
SO IEEE JOURNAL OF SOLID-STATE CIRCUITS
AB Quantum microscopy requires efficient detectors able to identify temporal correlations among photons. Photon coincidences are usually detected by postprocessing their timestamps measured by means of time-to-digital converters (TDCs), through a time and power-consuming procedure, which impairs the overall system performance. In this article, we propose an innovative single-photon sensitive imager based on single-photon avalanche diodes (SPADs), able to signal coincident photon pairs along with their position through a TDC-free, event-driven architecture. The result is a highly efficient detector (25.8%) with a 100% duty cycle and minimized data throughput. The modular architecture and the 330 ns readout time, independent of pixel number, pave the way to large format imagers based on the same paradigm. The detector enabled quantum imaging at extremely low, microwatt-level optical pump powers, four orders of magnitude lower than previous experiments with similar optical setups.

TI Quantum technologies in diamond enabled by laser processing
SO APPLIED PHYSICS LETTERS
AB Integrated photonic circuits promise to be foundational for applications in quantum information and sensing technologies, through their ability to confine and manipulate light. A key role in such technologies may be played by spin-active quantum emitters, which can be used to store quantum information or as sensitive probes of the local environment. A leading candidate is the negatively charged nitrogen vacancy (NV-) diamond color center, whose ground spin state can be optically read out, exhibiting long (similar to 1 ms) coherence times at room temperature. These properties have driven research toward the integration of photonic circuits in the bulk of diamond with the development of techniques allowing fabrication of optical waveguides. In particular, femtosecond laser writing has emerged as a powerful technique, capable of writing light guiding structures with 3D configurations as well as creating NV complexes. In this Perspective, the physical mechanisms behind laser fabrication in diamond will be reviewed. The properties of waveguides, single- and ensemble-NV centers, will be analyzed, together with the possibility to combine such structures in integrated photonic devices, which can find direct application in quantum information and sensing.

TI FPGA-Based Synchronization of Frequency-Domain Interferometer for QKD
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON QUANTUM ENGINEERING
AB In this article, we propose and experimentally demonstrate a novel synchronization method for quantum key distribution (QKD) systems. The method consists of maximizing the visibility of frequency-domain interference of optical sidebands about an optical carrier at the receiver node. The sidebands are generated by phase modulation of the optical carrier by an radio-frequency (RF) signal whose phase can be dynamically varied. The phase-variable RF signal is generated by the field-programmable gate array (FPGA) at the transmitter and the receiver using GTX transceivers. In order to facilitate this, we use square waveforms for RF signal instead of the conventional sinusoidal signals. We derive mathematical expressions for sideband power as a function of the phase difference between RF signals at transmitter and receiver. The phase is adjusted using dynamic phase shifter module, implemented by the FPGA. We propose a complete workflow that allows transmitter and receiver synchronization to within 12.6 ps directly over the quantum channel of QKD systems. Once synchronized, the same system can be switched over to quantum transmission by user-defined time delay. The workflow was implemented on a Xilinx Kintex-7 KC705 FPGA board. We studied the robustness of our technique by evaluating the stability of the interferometer over an operation of 10 min with standard deviation of interference to be less than 9% of the mean detection amplitude.

TI Encoding a magic state with beyond break-even fidelity
SO NATURE
AB To run large-scale algorithms on a quantum computer, error-correcting codes must be able to perform a fundamental set of operations, called logic gates, while isolating the encoded information from noise1-8. We can complete a universal set of logic gates by producing special resources called magic states9-11. It is therefore important to produce high-fidelity magic states to conduct algorithms while introducing a minimal amount of noise to the computation. Here we propose and implement a scheme to prepare a magic state on a superconducting qubit array using error correction. We find that our scheme produces better magic states than those that can be prepared using the individual qubits of the device. This demonstrates a fundamental principle of fault-tolerant quantum computing12, namely, that we can use error correction to improve the quality of logic gates with noisy qubits. Moreover, we show that the yield of magic states can be increased using adaptive circuits, in which the circuit elements are changed depending on the outcome of mid-circuit measurements. This demonstrates an essential capability needed for many error-correction subroutines. We believe that our prototype will be invaluable in the future as it can reduce the number of physical qubits needed to produce high-fidelity magic states in large-scale quantum-computing architectures.
   A scheme to prepare a magic state, an important ingredient for quantum computers, on a superconducting qubit array using error correction is proposed that produces better magic states than those that can be prepared using the individual qubits of the device.

TI Deterministic construction of arbitrary W states with
   quadratically increasing number of two-qubit gates
SO AIP ADVANCES
AB We propose a quantum circuit composed of cNOT gates and four single-qubit gates to generate a W state of three qubits. This circuit was then enhanced by integrating two-qubit gates to create a W state of four and five qubits. After a couple of enhancements, we show that an arbitrary W state can be generated depending only on the degree of enhancement. The generalized formula for the number of two-qubit gates required is given, showing that an n-qubit W-state generation can be achieved with quadratically increasing number of two-qubit gates. The practical feasibility is discussed regarding photon sources and various applications of cNOT gates. In addition, we discuss possible future directions for quantum-state networks, concerning quantum correlations of W states. (c) 2025 Author(s).

TI Secure Quantum Key Distribution Over VLC Networks for Next-Generation
   Smart Cities
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF NETWORKED AND DISTRIBUTED COMPUTING
AB Next-generation smart cities are increasingly reliant on high-speed, secure communication systems to support 6 G networks, IoT infrastructure, and autonomous systems. Classical cryptographic techniques are becoming vulnerable to quantum computing attacks, prompting the integration of quantum-secure communication mechanisms. In this context, Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) over Visible Light Communication (VLC) and Free Space Optical (FSO) networks offers a promising path toward ultra-secure, energy-efficient transmission. We propose an Entangled Photon Quantum Key Distribution (EP-QKD) framework that advances secure communication by integrating polarization-entangled photons, adaptive Quantum Bit Error Rate (QBER) optimization, and hybrid quantum-classical authentication anchored with blockchain. This advancement addresses critical limitations of traditional QKD systems-including high sensitivity to ambient interference, limited scalability, and high error rates-by employing entanglement-based noise resilience and real-time detection threshold control. Existing approaches to QoS and security-such as RSA-based encryption, BB84 and E91 protocols, and VLC-oriented modulation techniques-struggle with low secure key rates, high QBER under ambient light, and vulnerability to man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks. EP-QKD overcomes these limitations by enhancing photon distribution fidelity, enabling decentralized authentication, and sustaining low error rates across dynamic urban optical environments. Experimental results demonstrate that EP-QKD achieves an average QBER of 1.2% and maintains QBER below 2.5% at 1000 lux, reducing errors by 40% over BB84 and 60% over E91. It attains secure key generation rates of over 1200 Mbps at 5 meters, outperforming BB84 and E91 by a significant margin. At 20 meters, EP-QKD maintains 300 Mbps, while BB84 drops to 40 Mbps. The MITM attack success rate is reduced to 0.01%, compared to 15% with BB84 + RSA. Additionally, EP-QKD achieves energy efficiency of 0.7 nJ/bit-nearly half of BB84's requirement-making it suitable for energy-constrained IoT and mobile systems. Multi-user scalability testing confirms that EP-QKD can support up to 50 concurrent users with a key rate above 80 Mbps per user and QBER < 1.8%. A 3D analysis further shows that QBER remains below 5% even at 50 meters, demonstrating the framework's robustness for long-distance secure optical communication. Overall, the proposed EP-QKD framework significantly enhances the performance, scalability, and resilience of quantum communication systems, making it a viable candidate for 6 G, IoT, and satellite-based secure infrastructure.

TI Continuous evolution for efficient quantum architecture search
SO EPJ QUANTUM TECHNOLOGY
AB Variational quantum algorithms (VQAs) have been successfully applied to quantum approximate optimization algorithms, variational quantum compiling, and quantum machine learning models. The performance of VQAs is significantly influenced by the architecture of parameterized quantum circuits (PQCs). Quantum architecture search aims to automatically discover high-performance quantum circuits for specific VQA tasks. Quantum architecture search algorithms that utilize both SuperCircuit training and a parameter-sharing approach can save computational resources. If we directly follow the parameter-sharing approach, the SuperCircuit has to be trained to compensate for the worse search space. To address the challenges posed by the worse search space, we introduce an optimization strategy known as the efficient continuous evolutionary approach using Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm-II (NSGA-II). Then, we leverage prior information (symmetric property) designing Structure Symmetric Pruning for removing redundant gates of the searched ansatz. Experiments show that the efficient continuous evolutionary approach can search for more quantum architectures with better performance; the number of high-performance ansatzes obtained by our method is 10% higher than that in the literature (Du et al. in npj Quantum Inf. 8:62, 2022). The application of Structure Symmetric Pruning effectively reduces the number of parameters in quantum circuits without compromising their performance significantly. In binary classification tasks, the pruned quantum circuits exhibit an average accuracy reduction of 0.044 compared to their unpruned counterparts.

TI Correspondence between quasiparticle dissipation and quantum information
   decay in open quantum systems
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Diagrammatic techniques simplify a weakly interacting many-body problem into an effective fewquasiparticle problem within a system of interest (SOI). If scattering events, mediated by a bath, between those quasiparticles can be approximated as density-density interactions, the bath behaves like an effective external potential. On the other hand, exchange interactions could entangle those quasiparticles and the bath, leading to an open quantum system that induces quantum decoherence and spectral broadening. We investigate the renormalized interaction between the SOI and the bath, employing a projection operator technique similar to the one used in the Nakajima-Zwanzig method. We find that the frequency variation of this renormalized interaction is analogous to the quasiparticle residue and provides a measure of the SOI-bath separability that serves as the lower bound of the SOI-bath entanglement entropy. In the weak-coupling regime and continuum limit, we demonstrate that the degree of SOI-bath separability corresponds to the quasiparticle spectral weight in the single-impurity Anderson model and find that the loss of quantum information to the continuum of the bath can be understood as a decay process where an initial single-impurity state escapes to a thermal bath. This work provides a direction for connecting energy dissipation in quasiparticles propagation to the loss of quantum information in open quantum systems.

The parallelism, a result of the underlying tensor product structure of an n-qubit quantum register, and the sampling properties of quantum algorithms are used to build and optimize a parametric quantum circuit, which generates a quantum state that corresponds to the joint probability density function of the classical turbulent velocity components, p(u(1)',u(2)',u(3)'). Velocity samples are drawn by one-shot measurements on the quantum circuit. The hybrid quantum-classical algorithm is validated with two classical methods, a standard stochastic Lagrangian model and a classical sampling scheme in the form of a Markov-chain Monte Carlo approach. In detail, we consider a homogeneous turbulent shear flow with a constant shear rate S as a proof of concept for which the velocity fluctuations are Gaussian. The generation of the joint probability density function is also tested on a real quantum device, the 20-qubit IQM Resonance quantum computing platform for cases of up to 10 qubits. Our study paves the way to applications of Lagrangian small-scale parameterizations of turbulent transport in complex turbulent flows with quantum computers. A quantum advantage is possible by the efficient reconstruction of high-dimensional probability density functions, which can be sampled efficiently.

TI Optimizing Fractional Routing with Algebraic Transformations, AI, and
   Quantum Computing for Next-Generation Networks
SO SYMMETRY-BASEL
AB In fractional routing, the flows are distributed through different paths; this allows the maximum efficiency to be achieved by using several partial capacities to balance flow. However, the mathematical formalism for dynamic and scalable implementation is yet to be developed. This paper proposes the aforementioned hybrid framework of edge-linear transformations, AIs, and QCs for fractional routing optimizations. The system encodes flows by means of vector linear transformations over finite fields, supports real-time reconfiguration via deep reinforcement learning, and employs quantum algorithms such as QAOA and HHL for efficient minimization of path costs. The Python 3-based implementations of the model were utilized to test DAGs of a small- and medium-scale, showing a 30% increase in computational efficiency and a 25% drop in runtime compared to classical implementations. The evidence states that the practical-scalability results can be used for the real-time applications of emerging IoT and 6G networks.

TI Methods to accelerate high-throughput screening of atomic qubit
   candidates in van der Waals materials
SO JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYSICS
AB The discovery of atom-like spin emitters associated with defects in two-dimensional (2D) wide-bandgap (WBG) semiconductors presents new opportunities for highly tunable and versatile qubits. So far, the study of such spin emitters has focused on defects in hexagonal boron nitride (hBN). However, hBN necessarily contains a high density of nuclear spins, which are expected to create a strong incoherent spin-bath that leads to poor coherence properties of spins hosted in the material. Therefore, identification of new qubit candidates in other 2DWBG materials is necessary. Given the time demands of ab initio methods, new approaches for rapid screening and calculations of identifying properties of suitable atom-like qubits are required. In this work, we present two new methods for rapid estimation of the zerophonon line (ZPL), a key property of atomic qubits in WBG materials. First, the ZPL is calculated by exploiting Janak's theorem. For finite changes in occupation, we provide the leading-order estimate of the correction to the ZPL obtained using Janak's theorem, which is more rapid than the standard method (Delta SCF). Next, we demonstrate an approach to converging excited states that is faster for systems with small strain than the standard approach used in the Delta SCF method. We illustrate these methods using the case of the singly negatively charged calcium vacancy in SiS2, which we are the first to propose as a qubit candidate. This work has the potential to assist in accelerating the high-throughput search for quantum defects in materials, with applications in quantum sensing and quantum computing.

TI Optimizing frequency allocation for fixed-frequency superconducting
   quantum processors
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Fixed-frequency superconducting quantum processors are one of the most mature quantum computing architectures with high-coherence qubits and simple controls. However, high-fidelity multiqubit gates pose tight requirements on individual qubit frequencies in these processors, and these constraints are difficult to satisfy when constructing larger processors due to the large dispersion in the fabrication of Josephson junctions. In this paper, we propose a mixed-integer-programming-based optimization approach that determines qubit frequencies to maximize the fabrication yield of quantum processors. We study traditional qubit and qutrit (three-level) architectures with cross-resonance interaction processors. We compare these architectures to a differential ac-Stark shift based on entanglement gates and show that our approach greatly improves the fabrication yield and also increases the scalability of these devices. Our approach is general and can be adapted to problems where one must avoid specific frequency collisions.

TI Multiphoton and Side-Channel Attacks in Mistrustful Quantum Cryptography
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB Mistrustful cryptography includes important tasks like bit commitment, oblivious transfer, coin flipping, secure computations, position authentication, digital signatures and secure unforgeable tokens. Practical quantum implementations presently use photonic setups. In many such implementations, Alice sends photon pulses encoding quantum states and Bob chooses measurements on these states. In practice, Bob generally uses single-photon threshold detectors, which cannot distinguish the number of photons in detected pulses. Also, losses and other imperfections require Bob to report the detected pulses. Thus, malicious Alice can send and track multiphoton pulses and thereby gain information about Bob's measurement choices, violating the protocols' security. Here, we provide a theoretical framework for analyzing such multiphoton attacks, and present known and new attacks. We illustrate the power of these attacks with an experiment, and study their application to earlier experimental demonstrations of mistrustful quantum cryptography. We analyze countermeasures based on selective reporting and prove them inadequate. We also discuss side-channel attacks where Alice controls further degrees of freedom or sends other physical systems.

TI New material platform for superconducting transmon qubits with coherence
   times exceeding 0.3 milliseconds
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB The superconducting transmon qubit is a leading platform for quantum computing and quantum science. Building large, useful quantum systems based on transmon qubits will require significant improvements in qubit relaxation and coherence times, which are orders of magnitude shorter than limits imposed by bulk properties of the constituent materials. This indicates that relaxation likely originates from uncontrolled surfaces, interfaces, and contaminants. Previous efforts to improve qubit lifetimes have focused primarily on designs that minimize contributions from surfaces. However, significant improvements in the lifetime of two-dimensional transmon qubits have remained elusive for several years. Here, we fabricate two-dimensional transmon qubits that have both lifetimes and coherence times with dynamical decoupling exceeding 0.3 milliseconds by replacing niobium with tantalum in the device. We have observed increased lifetimes for seventeen devices, indicating that these material improvements are robust, paving the way for higher gate fidelities in multi-qubit processors. Quantum computers based on superconducting transmon qubits are limited by single qubit lifetimes and coherence times, which are orders of magnitude shorter than limits imposed by bulk material properties. Here, the authors fabricate two-dimensional transmon qubits with both lifetimes and coherence times longer than 0.3 milliseconds by replacing niobium with tantalum in the device.

TI Linearly Coupled Quantum Harmonic Oscillators and Their Quantum
   Entanglement
SO MATHEMATICS
AB In many applications of quantum optics, nonlinear physics, molecular chemistry and biophysics, one can encounter models in which the coupled quantum harmonic oscillator provides an explanation for many physical phenomena and effects. In general, these are harmonic oscillators coupled via coordinates and momenta, which can be represented as H<^>=& sum;i=12p<^>i22mi+mi omega i22xi2+H<^>int, where the interaction of two oscillators H<^>int=ik1x1p<^>2+ik2x2p<^>1+k3x1x2-k4p<^>1p<^>2. Despite the importance of this system, there is currently no general solution to the Schr & ouml;dinger equation that takes into account arbitrary initial states of the oscillators. Here, this problem is solved in analytical form, and it is shown that the probability of finding the system in any states and quantum entanglement depends only on one coefficient R is an element of(0,1) for the initial factorizable Fock states of the oscillator and depends on two parameters R is an element of(0,1) and phi for arbitrary initial states. These two parameters R is an element of(0,1) and phi include the entire set of variables of the system under consideration.

TI Optimising entanglement distribution policies under classical
   communication constraints assisted by reinforcement learning
SO MACHINE LEARNING-SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB Quantum repeaters play a crucial role in the effective distribution of entanglement over long distances. The nearest-future type of quantum repeater requires two operations: entanglement generation across neighbouring repeaters and entanglement swapping to promote short-range entanglement to long-range. For many hardware setups, these actions are probabilistic, leading to longer distribution times and incurred errors. Significant efforts have been vested in finding the optimal entanglement-distribution policy, i.e. the protocol specifying when a network node needs to generate or swap entanglement, such that the expected time to distribute long-distance entanglement is minimal. This problem is even more intricate in more realistic scenarios, especially when classical communication delays are taken into account. In this work, we formulate our problem as a Markov decision problem and use reinforcement learning (RL) to optimise over centralised strategies, where one designated node instructs other nodes which actions to perform. Contrary to most RL models, ours can be readily interpreted. Additionally, we introduce and evaluate a fixed local policy, the 'predictive swap-asap' policy, where nodes only coordinate with nearest neighbours. Compared to the straightforward generalisation of the common swap-asap policy to the scenario with classical communication effects, the 'wait-for-broadcast swap-asap' policy, both of the aforementioned entanglement-delivery policies are faster at high success probabilities. Our work showcases the merit of considering policies acting with incomplete information in the realistic case when classical communication effects are significant.

TI Quantum algorithms for process parallel flexible job shop scheduling

In addition, modern production planning and control strategies require continuous and process-parallel optimization of machine allocation and processing sequences. Therefore, this paper presents a new method for process parallel Flexible Job Shop Scheduling using the concept of quantum computing based optimization. A scientific benchmark and the application to a realistic use-case demonstrates the good performance and practicability of this new approach. A managerial insight shows how the approach for process parallel flexible job shop scheduling can be integrated in existing production planning and control IT-infrastructure. (C) 2021 The Authors.

TI Quantum information reveals that orbital-wise correlation is essentially
   classical in natural orbitals
SO JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL PHYSICS
AB The intersection of quantum chemistry and quantum computing has led to significant advancements in understanding the potential of using quantum devices for the efficient calculation of molecular energies. Simultaneously, this intersection enhances the comprehension of quantum chemical properties through the use of quantum computing and quantum information tools. This paper tackles a key question in this relationship: Is the nature of the orbital-wise electron correlations in wavefunctions of realistic prototypical cases classical or quantum? We address this question with a detailed investigation of molecular wavefunctions in terms of Shannon and von Neumann entropies, common tools of classical and quantum information theory. Our analysis reveals a notable distinction between classical and quantum mutual information in molecular systems when analyzed with Hartree-Fock canonical orbitals. However, this difference decreases dramatically, by similar to 100-fold, when natural orbitals are used as reference. This finding suggests that orbital correlations, when viewed through the appropriate basis, are predominantly classical. Consequently, our study underscores the importance of using natural orbitals to accurately assess molecular orbital correlations and to avoid their overestimation. (c) 2024 Author(s).

TI Composite Discordant States and Quantum Darwinism
SO ENTROPY
AB The framework of Quantum Darwinism strives at characterizing the quantum-to-classical transition by introducing the concept of redundancy of information-as measured by Mutual Information-that a set of observers would acquire on the state of a physical system of interest. Further development on this concept, in the form of Strong Quantum Darwinism and Spectrum Broadcast Structures, has recently led to a more fine-grained identification of the nature of such information, which should not involve any quantum correlations between observing and observed systems, while the assessment of information proliferation from individual systems has attracted most of the attention so far, the way such mechanism takes place in more complex states is open to exploration. To this end, we shall consider a two-qubit state, sharing initial quantum correlations in the form of Quantum Discord, and different dephasing-like interactions between them and an observing environment. We will focus on the amount of information regarding the subsystem not involved in the interaction that is proliferated to the environment. We shall refer to this as mediated redundancy. We will show that, in some cases, the channel capacity of the subsystems, given these interactions, can exceed that of the fragments.

TI Genuine Multipartite Nonlocality is Intrinsic to Quantum Networks
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB Quantum entanglement and nonlocality are inextricably linked. However, while entanglement is necessary for nonlocality, it is not always sufficient in the standard Bell scenario. We derive sufficient conditions for entanglement to give rise to genuine multipartite nonlocality in networks. We find that any network where the parties are connected by bipartite pure entangled states is genuine multipartite nonlocal, independently of the amount of entanglement in the shared states and of the topology of the network. As an application of this result, we also show that all pure genuine multipartite entangled states arc genuine multipartite nonlocal in the sense that measurements can be found on finitely many copies of any genuine multipartite entangled state to yield a genuine multipartite nonlocal behavior. Our results pave the way toward feasible manners of generating genuine multipartite nonlocality using any connected network.

TI Robust and fast post-processing of single-shot spin qubit detection
   events with a neural network
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB Establishing low-error and fast detection methods for qubit readout is crucial for efficient quantum error correction. Here, we test neural networks to classify a collection of single-shot spin detection events, which are the readout signal of our qubit measurements. This readout signal contains a stochastic peak, for which a Bayesian inference filter including Gaussian noise is theoretically optimal. Hence, we benchmark our neural networks trained by various strategies versus this latter algorithm. Training of the network with 10(6) experimentally recorded single-shot readout traces does not improve the post-processing performance. A network trained by synthetically generated measurement traces performs similar in terms of the detection error and the post-processing speed compared to the Bayesian inference filter. This neural network turns out to be more robust to fluctuations in the signal offset, length and delay as well as in the signal-to-noise ratio. Notably, we find an increase of 7% in the visibility of the Rabi oscillation when we employ a network trained by synthetic readout traces combined with measured signal noise of our setup. Our contribution thus represents an example of the beneficial role which software and hardware implementation of neural networks may play in scalable spin qubit processor architectures.

TI Topological Phase and Tunable Quantum State Transfer of
   Su-Schrieffer-Heeger Chain with an Embedded Quantum Ring
SO ADVANCED QUANTUM TECHNOLOGIES
AB An extended Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) model consisting of an SSH chain with an embedded quantum ring (QR) is investigated. In the case of two SSH chains with a symmetric distribution with respect to QR, by calculating the real-space winding number and energy spectrum, the hopping amplitude-induced topological phase is discovered. The probability distributions of gap states and the relationship between energy and magnetic flux prove the existence of the Aharonov-Bohm effect in the QR. Moreover, in the case of asymmetric distribution, the model possesses a zero-energy mode within the energy gap, and it is found that it can realize quantum state transfer. By adjusting the connection site between the right SSH chain and QR, the direction of the output port can be flexibly engineered. Furthermore, it is shown that high-fidelity quantum state transfer can still be achieved with the increasing of the system size. The tunable quantum state transfer based on the zero-energy mode can be equivalent to a topological tunable directional switch with properties of non-directional transfer. This work provides an approach for studying topological phase transition and tunable topological devices in an SSH chain with an embedded QR.
   An extended Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) model consisting of an SSH chain with an embedded quantum ring (QR) is proposed. The system has a topological phase and Aharonov-Bohm effect when the SSH chains are symmetrically distributed with respect to the QR. The system achieves quantum state transfer with tunable direction when the SSH chains are asymmetrically distributed with respect to the QR. image

TI Unconditionally secure quantum coin flipping
SO RESULTS IN PHYSICS
AB Quantum coin flipping (QCF) is an essential primitive for quantum cryptography. Unconditionally secure strong QCF with an arbitrarily small bias was widely believed to be impossible. But basing on a problem which cannot be solved without quantum algorithm, here we propose such a QCF protocol, and show how it manages to evade all existing no-go proofs on QCF.

TI Error statistics and scalability of quantum error mitigation formulas
SO NPJ QUANTUM INFORMATION
AB Quantum computing promises advantages over classical computing in many problems. Nevertheless, noise in quantum devices prevents most quantum algorithms from achieving the quantum advantage. Quantum error mitigation provides a variety of protocols to handle such noise using minimal qubit resources. While some of those protocols have been implemented in experiments for a few qubits, it remains unclear whether error mitigation will be effective in quantum circuits with tens to hundreds of qubits. In this paper, we apply statistics principles to quantum error mitigation and analyse the scaling behaviour of its intrinsic error. We find that the error increases linearly O(epsilon N) with the gate number N before mitigation and sublinearly O(epsilon'N-gamma) after mitigation, where gamma approximate to 0.5, epsilon is the error rate of a quantum gate, and epsilon' is a protocol-dependent factor. The root N scaling is a consequence of the law of large numbers, and it indicates that error mitigation can suppress the error by a larger factor in larger circuits. We propose the importance Clifford sampling as a key technique for error mitigation in large circuits to obtain this result.

TI Quantum Decoherence Technique for Two Two-level Interacting Atomic
   Engineering in Dissipative Field
SO COMPUTATIONAL INTELLIGENCE AND NEUROSCIENCE
AB In order to improve the in-depth understanding and research on the dissipative field of atomic engineering, the research object of this paper is the dissipative field of atomic engineering. Through the engineering of two two-level interacting atoms as the background, an in-depth study of two two-level atoms is carried out, so the decoherence factor of two two-level atoms is obtained. In this paper, the numerical simulation calculation experiment of the dissipative field of atomic engineering is carried out, and the evolution of the quantum coherent oscillation of the dissipative field to the quantum decoherence is discussed. The results indicate that the dissipation coefficient and strength of the atom-light field interaction not only affect the oscillation of the quantum coherent evolution of atomic states but also the periodicity of the evolution. All preliminary results throw light on the nature of two-level interacting atoms in the dissipative field of atomic engineering, which also provides a reference value for related researchers.

TI Strong Quantum Computational Advantage Using a Superconducting Quantum
   Processor
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB Scaling up to a large number of qubits with high-precision control is essential in the demonstrations of quantum computational advantage to exponentially outpace the classical hardware and algorithmic improvements. Here, we develop a two-dimensional programmable superconducting quantum processor, Zuchongzhi, which is composed of 66 functional qubits in a tunable coupling architecture. To characterize the performance of the whole system, we perform random quantum circuits sampling for benchmarking, up to a system size of 56 qubits and 20 cycles. The computational cost of the classical simulation of this task is estimated to be 2-3 orders of magnitude higher than the previous work on 53-qubit Sycamore processor [Nature 574, 505 (2019). We estimate that the sampling task finished by Zuchongzhi in about 1.2 h will take the most powerful supercomputer at least 8 yr. Our work establishes an unambiguous quantum computational advantage that is infeasible for classical computation in a reasonable amount of time. The high-precision and programmable quantum computing platform opens a new door to explore novel many-body phenomena and implement complex quantum algorithms.

TI Quantum Stream Cipher Based on Holevo-Yuen Theory
SO ENTROPY
AB In this review paper, we first introduce the basic concept of quantum computer-resistant cryptography, which is the cornerstone of security technology for the network of a new era. Then, we will describe the positioning of mathematical cryptography and quantum cryptography, that are currently being researched and developed. Quantum cryptography includes QKD and quantum stream cipher, but we point out that the latter is expected as the core technology of next-generation communication systems. Various ideas have been proposed for QKD quantum cryptography, but most of them use a single-photon or similar signal. Then, although such technologies are applicable to special situations, these methods still have several difficulties to provide functions that surpass conventional technologies for social systems in the real environment. Thus, the quantum stream cipher has come to be expected as one promising countermeasure, which artificially creates quantum properties using special modulation techniques based on the macroscopic coherent state. In addition, it has the possibility to provide superior security performance than one-time pad cipher. Finally, we introduce detailed research activity aimed at putting the quantum stream cipher into practical use in social network technology.

TI Advanced quantum key distribution protocol for mitigating quantum-based
   vulnerabilities in blockchain applications
SO EPJ QUANTUM TECHNOLOGY
AB Since blockchain platforms still depend on classical cryptographic protocols, they become more and more vulnerable to the rapid advancement of quantum computing. However, the emergence of quantum attacks has placed the need to develop Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) protocols that can preserve security while eliminating the limitations of quantum information systems, such as noise and error mitigation. To address these needs, this study proposes a novel Hybrid Rainbow-Kyber QKD (HRK-QKD) Protocol, which uses the strength of multivariate quadratic equations in Rainbow to mask the classical keys and the efficiency of lattice-based encryption in Kyber for key encryption. An entanglement-assisted dynamic key synthesis protocol that combines matrix-based quantum noise filtering, lattice-based multi-dimensional transformations and adaptive private key rotations is utilized. The proposed methods provide real-time mitigation of quantum noise and minimal performance overhead for key generation. HRK-QKD achieves the highest scalability ratio (Sc=2.7\documentclass[12pt]{minimal} \usepackage{amsmath} \usepackage{wasysym} \usepackage{amsfonts} \usepackage{amssymb} \usepackage{amsbsy} \usepackage{mathrsfs} \usepackage{upgreek} \setlength{\oddsidemargin}{-69pt} \begin{document}$Sc=2.7$\end{document}), the best noise resilience (0.90-0.99), and the highest quantum security measure (QS=0.064881\documentclass[12pt]{minimal} \usepackage{amsmath} \usepackage{wasysym} \usepackage{amsfonts} \usepackage{amssymb} \usepackage{amsbsy} \usepackage{mathrsfs} \usepackage{upgreek} \setlength{\oddsidemargin}{-69pt} \begin{document}$Q_{S}=0.064881$\end{document}) with minimal information leakage probability (0.00001). This advancement also means blockchain remains a resilient technology against quantum threats, with an economical, scalable, and high-accuracy solution for next-generation secure communication systems.

TI Effective quantum feature maps in quantum extreme reservoir computation
   from the XY model
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB It is well known in quantum machine learning that the form of the feature map has a significant effect on the operation and performance of those tasks being undertaken. It is essential to investigate how to generate an effective feature map within the limitations of the number of qubits and quantum gates to apply in noisy intermediate-scale quantum devices. In this paper, we explore how the qubit connectivity impacts the performance of quantum extreme reservoir computation (QERC) for image classification using the XY Hamiltonian. We find that networks of qubits with simple connectivity generate an effective feature map, whereas a network with high connectivity does not since the XY Hamiltonian on it yields a unitary map with a periodic property. The existence of the periodicity can be fully determined by the underlying connectivity and the overall symmetry of the Hamiltonian. However, the symmetries in the XY Hamiltonians can contribute to a better generalization for QERC. We further find that it is possible to design QERC to give this high generalization property while maintaining high accuracy. Our work suggests that Hamiltonian dynamics with simple connectivity or symmetry can be exploited as a computational resource in quantum machine learning.

AB Quantum computers with hundreds of qubits will be available soon. Unfortunately, high device error-rates pose a significant challenge in using these near-term quantum systems to power real-world applications. Executing a program on existing quantum systems generates both correct and incorrect outcomes, but often, the output distribution is too noisy to distinguish between them. In this paper, we show that erroneous outcomes are not arbitrary but exhibit a well-defined structure when represented in the Hamming space. Our experiments on IBM and Google quantum computers show that the most frequent erroneous outcomes are more likely to be close in the Hamming space to the correct outcome. We exploit this behavior to improve the ability to infer the correct outcome.
   We propose Hamming Reconstruction (HAMMER), a post-processing technique that leverages the observation of Hamming behavior to reconstruct the noisy output distribution, such that the resulting distribution has higher fidelity. We evaluate HAMMER using experimental data from Google and IBM quantum computers with more than 500 unique quantum circuits and obtain an average improvement of 1.37x in the quality of solution. On Google's publicly available QAOA datasets, we show that HAMMER sharpens the gradients on the cost function landscape.

TI Simple Multiuser Twin-Field Quantum Key Distribution Network
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW APPLIED
AB Twin-field quantum key distribution (TFQKD) systems have shown great promise for implementing practical long-distance secure quantum communication due to its measurement-device-independent nature and its ability to offer fundamentally superior rate-loss scaling than point-to-point QKD systems. A surge of research and development effort in the last two years has produced many variants of protocols and experimental demonstrations. In terms of hardware topology, TFQKD systems interfering quantum signals from two remotely phase-locked laser sources are in essence giant Mach-Zehnder interferometers (MZIs) requiring active phase stabilization. Such configurations are inherently unsuitable for a TFQKD network, where more than one user pair share the common quantum measurement station, because it is practically extremely difficult, if not impossible, to stabilize MZIs of largely disparate path lengths, a situation that is inevitable in a multi-user-pair TFQKD network. On the other hand, Sagnac interferometer-based TFQKD systems exploiting the inherent phase stability of the Sagnac ring can implement asymmetric TFQKD, and are therefore eminently suitable for implementing a TFQKD network. In this work, we experimentally demonstrate a proof-of-principle multi-user-pair Sagnac TFQKD network where three user pairs sharing the same measurement station can perform pairwise TFQKD through time multiplexing, with channel losses up to 58.00 dB, and channel loss asymmetry up to 15.00 dB. In some cases, the secure key rates still beat the rate-loss bound for point-to-point repeaterless QKD systems, even in this network configuration. Our demonstration of this multi-user-pair TFQKD network is a step in advancing quantum-communication network technologies.

TI Multi-layered security system: Integrating quantum key distribution with
   classical cryptography to enhance steganographic security
SO ALEXANDRIA ENGINEERING JOURNAL
AB This research introduces a novel cryptographic system that enhances the security of steganographic images by integrating Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) with traditional encryption. Using the E91 QKD protocol, it generates a shared secret key between parties, leveraging quantum entanglement to provide superior protection against eavesdropping. The quantum key is then hashed with the Secure Hash Algorithm (SHA) to produce a fixed-length, high-entropy key for symmetric encryption. The Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) is employed to encrypt steganographic images, which conceal critical data within digital images, adding an extra layer of security through obscurity. Experiments with images of varying resolutions (64 x 64 to 512 x 512 pixels) show consistent encryption performance. The encrypted images exhibit high randomness, with an average entropy of 7.9929. Differential attack resilience is demonstrated by a Number of Pixels Change Rate (NPCR) averaging 99.6928% and a Unified Average Changing Intensity (UACI) of 56.1549%. The average E91 protocol key generation time is 5.78 s with a key rate of 7.43 bps. Encryption and decryption times for test images are 0.00149 and 0.00175 s, respectively. This research combines quantum and classical cryptography with steganography, providing a robust security framework highly resistant to both quantum and classical threats.

TI Optimized entropic uncertainty relations for multiple measurements
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Recently, an entropic uncertainty relation for multiple measurements was proposed by Liu et al. [Phys. Rev. A 91, 042133 (2015)]. However, the lower bound of the relation is not always tight with respect to different measurements. Herein, we improve the lower bound of the entropic uncertainty relation for multiple measurements, referred to as a simply constructed bound (SCB). We verify that the SCB is tighter than Liu et al.'s result for arbitrary mutually unbiased basis measurements, which might play a fundamental and crucial role in practical quantum information processing. Moreover, we optimize the SCB by considering mutual information and the Holevo quantity, and propose an optimized SCB. Notably, the proposed bounds are extrapolations of the behavior of two measurements to a larger collection of measurements. It is believed that our findings would shed light on entropy-based uncertainty relations in the multiple measurement scenario and will be beneficial for security analysis in quantum key distributions.

TI Photonic quantum convolutional neural networks with adaptive state
   injection
SO ADVANCED PHOTONICS
AB Recent photonic quantum machine learning proposals combined linear optics with adaptivity to enhance expressivity and improve algorithm performance and scalability. The particle-number-preserving property of linear optical platforms was recently employed to design a quantum convolutional neural network architecture with advantages in terms of resource complexity and the number of parameters needed. Here, we design and experimentally implement a photonic quantum convolutional neural network (PQCNN) based on linear optics equipped with adaptive state injection, a tool that increases the linear optical circuits controllability. We validate the PQCNN for a binary image classification on a photonic platform utilizing a semiconductor quantum dot-based single-photon source and programmable integrated photonic interferometers comprising 8 and 12 modes. To investigate the scalability of the PQCNN design, we performed numerical simulations on datasets of different sizes. These findings demonstrate potential utilities of a simple adaptive technique for a nonlinear boson sampling task, compatible with near-term quantum devices.

TI Efficient Decomposition of Unitary Matrices in Quantum Circuit Compilers
SO APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL
AB Unitary decomposition is a widely used method to map quantum algorithms to an arbitrary set of quantum gates. Efficient implementation of this decomposition allows for the translation of bigger unitary gates into elementary quantum operations, which is key to executing these algorithms on existing quantum computers. The decomposition can be used as an aggressive optimization method for the whole circuit, as well as to test part of an algorithm on a quantum accelerator. For the selection and implementation of the decomposition algorithm, perfect qubits are assumed. We base our decomposition technique on Quantum Shannon Decomposition, which generates O(344(n)) controlled-not gates for an n-qubit input gate. In addition, we implement optimizations to take advantage of the potential underlying structure in the input or intermediate matrices, as well as to minimize the execution time of the decomposition. Comparing our implementation to Qubiter and the UniversalQCompiler (UQC), we show that our implementation generates circuits that are much shorter than those of Qubiter and not much longer than the UQC. At the same time, it is also up to 10 times as fast as Qubiter and about 500 times as fast as the UQC.

TI Measuring correlation and entanglement between molecular orbitals on a
   trapped-ion quantum computer
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB Quantifying correlation and entanglement between molecular orbitals can elucidate the role of quantum effects in strongly correlated reaction processes. However, accurately storing the wavefunction for a classical computation of those quantities can be prohibitive. Here we use the Quantinuum H1-1 trapped-ion quantum computer to calculate von Neumann entropies which quantify the orbital correlation and entanglement in a strongly correlated molecular system relevant to lithium-ion batteries (vinylene carbonate interacting with an O2 molecule). As shown in previous works, fermionic superselection rules decrease correlations and reduce measurement overheads for constructing orbital reduced density matrices. Taking into account superselection rules we further reduce the number of measurements by finding commuting sets of Pauli operators. Using low overhead noise reduction techniques, we calculate von Neumann entropies in excellent agreement with noiseless benchmarks, indicating that correlations and entanglement between molecular orbitals can be accurately estimated from a quantum computation. Our results show that the one-orbital entanglement vanishes unless opposite-spin open shell configurations are present in the wavefunction.

TI On the Mixed-Unitary Rank of Quantum Channels
SO COMMUNICATIONS IN MATHEMATICAL PHYSICS
AB In the theory of quantum information, the mixed-unitary quantum channels, for any positive integer dimension n, are those linear maps that can be expressed as a convex combination of conjugations by n x n complex unitary matrices. We consider the mixed-unitary rank of any such channel, which is the minimum number of distinct unitary conjugations required for an expression of this form. We identify several new relationships between the mixed-unitary rank N and the Choi rank r of mixed-unitary channels, the Choi rank being equal to the minimum number of nonzero terms required for a Kraus representation of that channel. Most notably, we prove that the inequality N <= r(2) - r + 1 is satisfied for every mixed-unitary channel (as is the equality N = 2 when r = 2), and we exhibit the first known examples of mixed-unitary channels for which N > r. Specifically, we prove that there exist mixed-unitary channels having Choi rank d + 1 and mixed-unitary rank 2d for infinitely many positive integers d, including every prime power d. We also examine the mixed-unitary ranks of the mixed-unitary Werner-Holevo channels.

TI Optimal quantum sensing of the nonlinear bosonic interactions using Fock
   states
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Nonlinear processes with individual quanta beyond bilinear interactions are essential for quantum technology with bosonic systems. Diverse coherent splitting and merging of quanta in them already manifest in the estimation of their nonlinear coupling from observed statistics. We derive nontrivial but optimal strategies for sensing the experimentally feasible trilinear interactions, served here as basic gates and examples of multimode nonlinear interactions, using nonclassical particlelike Fock states as a probe and feasible measurement strategies. Remarkably, the optimal probing of nonlinear coupling reaches estimation errors scaled down with N-3/2 for overall N of quanta in specific and high-quality Fock states in all interacting modes. It can reveal unexplored aspects of nonlinear dynamics relevant to using such nonlinear processes in bosonic experiments with trapped ions and superconducting circuits and opens further developments of quantum technology with them.

TI Decoherence and Landauer's principle in qubit-cavity
   quantum-field-theory interaction
SO EUROPEAN PHYSICAL JOURNAL C
AB We consider quantum decoherence and Landauer's principle in qubit-cavity quantum field theory (QFT) interaction, treating the qubit as the system and cavity QFT as the environment. In particular, we investigate the changes that occur in the system with a pure initial state and environment during the decoherence process, with or without energy dissipation, and compare the results with the case in which the initial state of the system is a mixed state and thus decoherence is absent. When we choose an interaction Hamiltonian such that the energy and coherence of the system change simultaneously, the population change of the system and the energy change are the same when the initial state is mixed. However, the decoherence terms increase the von Neumann entropy of the system. In this case the energy change and decoherence of the system are not independent physical processes. The decoherence process maintains unitarity. On the other hand, if the interaction Hamiltonian does not change the energy of the system, there is only the decoherence effect. The environment will be a distribution in the basis of the displaced number state and always increases the energy. Landauer's principle is satisfied in both cases.

TI Leveraging Quantum Annealing for Layout Optimization
SO ADVANCED QUANTUM TECHNOLOGIES
AB Layout optimization problems involve finding the optimal arrangement of elements in order to maximize efficiency. For instance, the wind farm layout optimization (WFLO) problem consists of the best turbine placement to maximize energy production while minimizing wake losses. As its nonlinear and combinatorial nature makes it challenging for traditional optimization methods, alternative approaches such as quantum annealing and quantum-classical hybrid methods offer a promising alternative for tackling such complex problems. Here, WFLO is formulated as a Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) problem using the Jensen wake model. A quantum annealer is compared, the Gurobi solver, and the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA). The quantum annealer provides solutions one order of magnitude faster than Gurobi with at most 3% lower power output, making it suitable for rapid suboptimal approximations. These findings highlight the trade-off between the quality of the solution and the computational time and demonstrate how quantum methods, especially when combined with classical solvers, can contribute to efficient renewable energy optimization.

TI Fermionic simulators for enhanced scalability of variational quantum
   simulation
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Near-term quantum simulators are mostly based on qubit-based architectures. However, their imperfect nature significantly limits their practical application. The situation is even worse for simulating fermionic systems, which underlie most of material science and chemistry, as one has to adopt fermion-to-qubit encodings which create significant additional resource overhead and trainability issues. Thanks to recent advances in trapping and manipulation of neutral atoms in optical tweezers, digital fermionic quantum simulators are becoming viable. A key question is whether these emerging fermionic simulators can outperform qubit-based simulators for characterizing strongly correlated electronic systems. Here we perform a comprehensive comparison of resource efficiency between qubit and fermionic simulators for variational ground-state emulation of fermionic systems in both condensed matter systems and quantum chemistry problems. We show that the fermionic simulators indeed outperform their qubit counterparts with respect to resources for quantum evolution (circuit depth) as well as classical optimization (number of required parameters and iterations). In addition, they show less sensitivity to the random initialization of the circuit. The relative advantage of fermionic simulators becomes even more pronounced as interaction becomes stronger, or tunneling is allowed in more than one dimension, as well as for spinful fermions. Importantly, this improvement is scalable, i.e., the performance gap between fermionic and qubit simulators only grows for bigger system sizes.

TI Hotter is Easier: Unexpected Temperature Dependence of Spin Qubit
   Frequencies
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW X
AB As spin-based quantum processors grow in size and complexity, maintaining high fidelities and minimizing crosstalk will be essential for the successful implementation of quantum algorithms and errorcorrection protocols. In particular, recent experiments have highlighted pernicious transient qubit frequency shifts associated with microwave qubit driving. Work-arounds for small devices, including prepulsing with an off-resonant microwave burst to bring a device to a steady state, wait times prior to measurement, and qubit-specific calibrations all bode ill for device scalability. Here, we make substantial progress in understanding and overcoming this effect. We report a surprising nonmonotonic relation between mixing chamber temperature and spin Larmor frequency which is consistent with observed frequency shifts induced by microwave and baseband control signals. We find that purposefully operating the device at 200 mK greatly suppresses the adverse heating effect while not compromising qubit coherence or single-qubit fidelity benchmarks. Furthermore, systematic non-Markovian crosstalk is greatly reduced. Our results provide a straightforward means of improving the quality of multispin control while simplifying calibration procedures for future spin-based quantum processors.

TI Quantum algorithm for quicker clinical prognostic analysis: an
   application and experimental study using CT scan images of COVID-19
   patients
SO BMC MEDICAL INFORMATICS AND DECISION MAKING
AB Background In medical diagnosis and clinical practice, diagnosing a disease early is crucial for accurate treatment, lessening the stress on the healthcare system. In medical imaging research, image processing techniques tend to be vital in analyzing and resolving diseases with a high degree of accuracy. This paper establishes a new image classification and segmentation method through simulation techniques, conducted over images of COVID-19 patients in India, introducing the use of Quantum Machine Learning (QML) in medical practice. Methods This study establishes a prototype model for classifying COVID-19, comparing it with non-COVID pneumonia signals in Computed tomography (CT) images. The simulation work evaluates the usage of quantum machine learning algorithms, while assessing the efficacy for deep learning models for image classification problems, and thereby establishes performance quality that is required for improved prediction rate when dealing with complex clinical image data exhibiting high biases. Results The study considers a novel algorithmic implementation leveraging quantum neural network (QNN). The proposed model outperformed the conventional deep learning models for specific classification task. The performance was evident because of the efficiency of quantum simulation and faster convergence property solving for an optimization problem for network training particularly for large-scale biased image classification task. The model run-time observed on quantum optimized hardware was 52 min, while on K80 GPU hardware it was 1 h 30 min for similar sample size. The simulation shows that QNN outperforms DNN, CNN, 2D CNN by more than 2.92% in gain in accuracy measure with an average recall of around 97.7%. Conclusion The results suggest that quantum neural networks outperform in COVID-19 traits' classification task, comparing to deep learning w.r.t model efficacy and training time. However, a further study needs to be conducted to evaluate implementation scenarios by integrating the model within medical devices.

TI Robustness of continuous variable quantum key distribution under strong
   polarization drift
SO EPJ QUANTUM TECHNOLOGY
AB The practical deployment of Continuous Variables Quantum Key Distribution (CV-QKD) systems benefits from existing optical fiber telecommunication infrastructures. However, optical fibers introduce random variations in the state of polarization, which degrades the system's performance. We consider a CV-QKD system featuring a polarization diversity heterodyne receiver and the constant modulus algorithm (CMA) to compensate for the polarization drifts in the quantum channel. Our setup can effectively realign Alice's quantum signal with Bob's local oscillator for polarization drift variances below 10-10. This value is compatible with most experimental implementations, allowing for accurate estimation of the channel transmission and excess noise parameters. Our results establish operational limits for passive polarization drift compensation using a polarization diversity receiver combined with digital CMA, validating its use to compensate for the polarization drift in real-world implementations approximating the ideal scenario of no polarization drift, for polarization drift variances below 10-10. This enables long-term stability in CV-QKD systems, eliminating the need for active polarization controllers and manual adjustments.

TI Quantum annealing for the adjuster routing problem
SO FRONTIERS IN PHYSICS
AB In the event of a disaster such as an earthquake, insurance companies basically conduct on-site witnessing. Depending on the scale of the disaster, hundreds of adjusters are dispatched from each office to the affected buildings per day. In such cases, which adjusters will witness which buildings and in what order must be determined, and the route must be optimized to conduct efficient witnessing. In this study, we define this witnessing route decision as an optimization problem and propose the adjuster routing problem (ARP). The ARP can be viewed as an extension of the vehicle routing problem (VRP). We introduce constraints not to be considered in the usual VRP, such as adjuster-building matching and satisfying the desired time. The VRP is an NP-hard optimization problem and is considered difficult to solve on a classical computer. Therefore, we formulated various constraints in QUBO so that quantum annealing can be applied to the ARP. In addition, we conducted numerical experiments with D-Wave. The ARP is a real problem, and our research provides a new example of applications of quantum annealing to real-world problems.

TI Entanglement witnesses for stabilizer states and subspaces beyond qubits
SO REPORTS ON PROGRESS IN PHYSICS
AB Genuine multipartite entanglement (GME) is arguably the most valuable form of entanglement in the multipartite case with application for instance in quantum metrology. In order to detect that form of entanglement in multipartite quantum states, one typically uses entanglement witnesses. The aim of this paper is to generalize the results of T & oacute;th and G & uuml;hne (2005 Phys. Rev. A 72 022340) in order to provide a construction of witnesses of GME tailored to entangled subspaces originating from the multi-qudit stabilizer formalism-a framework well known for its role in quantum error correction, which also provides a very convenient description of a broad class of entangled multipartite states (both pure and mixed). Our construction includes graph states of arbitrary local dimension. We then show that in certain situations, the obtained witnesses detecting GME in quantum systems of higher local dimension are superior in terms of noise robustness to those derived for multiqubit states.

TI Quantum algorithm for credit valuation adjustments
SO NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB Quantum mechanics is well known to accelerate statistical sampling processes over classical techniques. In quantitative finance, statistical samplings arise broadly in many use cases. Here we focus on a particular one of such use cases, credit valuation adjustment (CVA), and identify opportunities and challenges towards quantum advantage for practical instances. To build a NISQ-friendly quantum circuit able to solve such problem, we draw on various heuristics that indicate the potential for significant improvement over well-known techniques such as reversible logical circuit synthesis. In minimizing the resource requirements for amplitude amplification while maximizing the speedup gained from the quantum coherence of a noisy device, we adopt a recently developed Bayesian variant of quantum amplitude estimation using engineered likelihood functions. We perform numerical analyses to characterize the prospect of quantum speedup in concrete CVA instances over classical Monte Carlo simulations.

AB We develop the theory of single-electron silicon spin qubit relaxation in the presence of a magnetic field gradient. Such field gradients are routinely generated by on-chip micromagnets to allow for electrically controlled quantum gates on spin qubits. We build on a valley-dependent envelope function theory that enables the analysis of the electron wave function in a silicon quantum dot with an arbitrary roughness at the interface. We assume the presence of single-layer atomic steps at a Si/SiGe interface and study how the presence of a gradient field modifies the spin-mixing mechanisms. We show that our theoretical modeling can quantitatively reproduce the results of experimental measurements of qubit relaxation in silicon in the presence of a micromagnet. We further study how a field gradient can modify the EDSR Rabi frequency as well as the quality factor of a silicon spin qubit. We show that this strongly depends on the details of the interface roughness. Interestingly, for a quantum dot with an ideally flat interface, adding a micromagnet can give rise to the reduction of the EDSR frequency within some interval of the external magnetic field strength.

TI Portable Device for Multipurpose Research on Dendritic Yanson Point
   Contacts and Quantum Sensing
SO NANOMATERIALS
AB Quantum structures are ideal objects by which to discover and study new sensor mechanisms and implement advanced approaches in sensor analysis to develop innovative sensor devices. Among them, one of the most interesting representatives is the Yanson point contact. It allows the implementation of a simple technological chain to activate the quantum mechanisms of selective detection in gaseous and liquid media. In this work, a portable device for multipurpose research on dendritic Yanson point contacts and quantum sensing was developed and manufactured. The device allows one to create dendritic Yanson point contacts and study their quantum properties, which are clearly manifested in the process of the electrochemical cyclic switchover effect. The device tests demonstrated that it was possible to gather data on the compositions and characteristics of the synthesized substances, and on the electrochemical processes that influence the production of dendritic Yanson point contacts, as well as on the electrophysical processes that provide information on the quantum nature of the electrical conductance of dendritic Yanson point contacts. The small size of the device makes it simple to integrate into a micro-Raman spectrometer setup. The developed device may be used as a prototype for designing a quantum sensor that will serve as the foundation for cutting-edge sensor technologies, as well as be applied to research into atomic-scale junctions, single-atom transistors, and any relative subjects.

TI High-Speed Privacy Amplification Algorithm Using Cellular Automate in
   Quantum Key Distribution
SO ELECTRONICS
AB Privacy amplification is an important step in the post-processing of quantum communication, which plays an indispensable role in the security of quantum key distribution systems. In this paper, we propose a Cellular Automata-based privacy amplification algorithm, which improves the speed of key distribution. The proposed algorithm is characterized by block iteration to generate secure key of arbitrary length. The core of the algorithm in this paper is to use the property that Cellular Automata can generate multiple new associated random sequences at the same time to carry out bit operations for multiple negotiation keys in the meantime and calculate in turn, so as to quickly realize the compression of negotiation keys. By analyzing the final key, the proposed algorithm has the advantages of fast key generation speed and high real-time performance. At the same time, the results of the NIST randomness test and avalanche test show that the algorithm has good randomness performance.

TI Quantifying entanglement in cluster states built with error-prone
   interactions
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Measurement-based quantum computing is an alternative paradigm to the circuit-based model. This approach can be advantageous in certain scenarios, such as when read-out is fast and accurate, but two-qubit gates realized via inter-particle interactions are slow and can be parallelized to efficiently create a cluster state. However, understanding how two-qubit errors impact algorithm accuracy and developing experimentally viable approaches to characterize cluster-state fidelity are outstanding challenges. Here, we consider one-dimensional cluster states built from controlled phase, Ising, and XY interactions with slow two-qubit error in the interaction strength, consistent with error models of interactions found in a variety of qubit architectures. We detail an experimentally viable teleportation fidelity that offers a measure of the impact of these errors on the cluster state. Our fidelity calculations show that the error has a distinctly different impact depending on the underlying interaction used for the two-qubit entangling gate. In particular, the Ising and XY interactions can allow perfect teleportation through the cluster state even with large errors, but the controlled phase interaction does not. Nonetheless, we find that teleportation through cluster state chains of size N has a maximum two-qubit error for teleportation along a quantum channel that decreases as N-1/2. To enable the construction of larger cluster states, we design lowest-order refocusing pulses for correcting these slow errors in the interaction strength. Our work generalizes to higher-dimensional cluster states and sets the stage for experiments to monitor the growth of entanglement in cluster states built from error-prone interactions.

TI Role of Bell-CHSH violation and local filtering in quantum key
   distribution
SO PHYSICS LETTERS A
AB In this article, we analyse the relationship between the Bell violation and the secure key rate of entanglement assisted quantum key distribution (QKD) protocols. Specifically, we address the question whether Bell violation is necessary or sufficient for secure communication. We construct a class of states which do not show Bell violation, however, which can be used for secure communication after local filtering. Similarly, we identify another class of states which show Bell violation but can not be used for generating secure key even after local filtering. The existence of these two classes of states demonstrates that Bell violation as an initial resource is neither necessary nor sufficient for QKD, while it becomes necessary after filtration. Our work therefore forces a departure from traditional thinking that the degree of Bell violation is a key resource for quantum communication and brings out the role of local filtering.

TI Control and readout of a 13-level trapped ion qudit
SO NPJ QUANTUM INFORMATION
AB Scaling up the computational space of a quantum system is necessary to demonstrate quantum algorithmic advantage. Currently, including more information carriers is still a physical challenge in general. A less explored avenue for scaling up the computational space involves utilizing the rich energy level structure of a trapped ion to encode multi-level qudits rather than two-level qubits. Here we show control and single-shot readout of qudits with 13 computational states in our chosen information host, 137Ba+. Utilizing the additional energy states found in 137Ba+ comes with non-trivial complexities which obscure the practical choices of energy states for qudit encoding. We report on tools we have developed for predicting energy states that are practical for qudit encoding, validated with good agreement with our experimental data. We also identify the major error sources for qudit control with 137Ba+ as avenues for improvement to achieve high fidelity operations.

TI Design of an Integrated Bell-State Analyzer on a Thin-Film Lithium
   Niobate Platform
SO IEEE PHOTONICS JOURNAL
AB Trapped ions are excellent candidates for quantum computing and quantum networks because of their long coherence times, ability to generate entangled photons as well as high fidelity single- and two-qubit gates. To scale up trapped ion quantum computing, we need a Bell-state analyzer on a reconfigurable platform that can herald high fidelity entanglement between ions. In this work, we design a photonic Bell-state analyzer on a reconfigurable thin-film lithium niobate platform for polarization-encoded qubits. We optimize the device to achieve high fidelity entanglement between two trapped ions and find >99% fidelity. Apart from that, the directional coupler used in our design can achieve any polarization-independent power splitting ratio which can have a rich variety of applications in the integrated photonic technology. The proposed device can scale up trapped ion quantum computing as well as other optically active spin qubits, such as color centers in diamond, quantum dots, and rare-earth ions.

TI Efficient Multi Port-Based Teleportation Schemes
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INFORMATION THEORY
AB In this manuscript we analyse generalised port-based teleportation (PBT) schemes, allowing for transmitting more than one unknown quantum state (or a composite quantum state) in one go, where the state ends up in several ports at Bob's side. We investigate the efficiency of our scheme discussing both deterministic and probabilistic case, where parties share maximally entangled states. It turns out that the new scheme gives better performance than various variants of the optimal PBT protocol used for the same task. All the results are presented in group-theoretic manner depending on such quantities like dimensions and multiplicities of irreducible representations in the Schur-Weyl duality. The presented analysis was possible by considering the algebra of permutation operators acting on n systems distorted by the action of partial transposition acting on more than one subsystem. Considering its action on the n- fold tensor product of the Hilbert space with finite dimension, we present construction of the respective irreducible matrix representations, which are in fact matrix irreducible representations of the Walled Brauer Algebra. I turns out that the introduced formalism, and symmetries beneath it, appears in many aspects of theoretical physics and mathematics - theory of anti ferromagnetism, aspects of gravity theory or in the problem of designing quantum circuits for special task like for example inverting an unknown unitary.

TI Suppressing Counter-Rotating Errors for Fast Single-Qubit Gates with
   Fluxonium
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB Qubit decoherence unavoidably degrades the fidelity of quantum logic gates. Accordingly, realizing gates that are as fast as possible is a guiding principle for qubit control, necessitating protocols for mitigating error channels that become significant as gate time is decreased. One such error channel arises from the counter-rotating component of strong, linearly polarized drives. This error channel is particularly important when gate times approach the qubit Larmor period and represents the dominant source of infidelity for sufficiently fast single-qubit gates with low-frequency qubits such as fluxonium. In this work, we develop and demonstrate two complementary protocols for mitigating this error channel. The first protocol realizes circularly polarized driving in circuit QED through simultaneous charge and flux control. The second protocol-commensurate pulses-leverages the coherent and periodic nature of counter-rotating fields to regularize their contributions to gates, enabling single-qubit gate fidelities reliably exceeding 99.997%. This protocol is platform independent and requires no additional calibration overhead. This work establishes straightforward strategies for mitigating counter-rotating effects from strong drives in circuit QED and other platforms, which we expect to be helpful in the effort to realize high-fidelity control for fault-tolerant quantum computing.

TI Quantification of entanglement and coherence with purity detection
SO NPJ QUANTUM INFORMATION
AB Entanglement and coherence are fundamental properties of quantum systems, promising to power near-future quantum technologies, such as quantum computation, quantum communication, and quantum metrology. Yet, their quantification, rather than mere detection, generally requires reconstructing the spectrum of quantum states, i.e., experimentally challenging measurement sets that increase exponentially with the system size. Here, we demonstrate quantitative bounds to operationally useful entanglement and coherence that are universally valid, analytically computable, and experimentally friendly. Specifically, our main theoretical results are lower and upper bounds to the coherent information and the relative entropy of coherence in terms of local and global purities of quantum states. To validate our proposal, we experimentally implement two purity detection methods in an optical system: shadow estimation with random measurements and collective measurements on pairs of state copies. The experiment shows that both the coherent information and the relative entropy of coherence of pure and mixed unknown quantum states can be bounded by purity functions. Our research offers an efficient means of verifying large-scale quantum information processing.

AB We develop a systematic perturbative framework to engineer an arbitrary target Hamiltonian in the Floquet phase space of a periodically driven oscillator based on Floquet-Magnus expansion. The high-order errors in the engineered Floquet Hamiltonian are mitigated by adding high-order driving potentials perturbatively. We introduce a transformation method that allows us to obtain an analytical expression of the leading-order correction drive for engineering a target Hamiltonian with discrete rotational and chiral symmetries in phase space. We also provide a numerically efficient procedure to calculate high-order correction drives and apply it to engineer the target Hamiltonian with degenerate eigenstates of multi-component cat states that are important for fault-tolerant hardware-efficiency bosonic quantum computation.

TI A Semi-Quantum Private Comparison Base on W-States

AB Privacy comparison is an important research topic in secure multi-party computing, widely used in e-commerce, secret ballots, and other fields. However, the development of quantum computing power poses a growing potential security threat to secure multi-party algorithms based on mathematically tricky problems, and most of the proposed quantum privacy comparison schemes could be more efficient. Therefore, based on the W-state, we offer a more efficient semi-quantum privacy comparison method. The security analysis shows that the scheme can resist third-party, measurement, and entanglement attacks. Compared with the previous work, the scheme significantly improves communication efficiency and has stronger practicability.

TI Entanglement formation in continuous-variable random quantum networks
SO NPJ QUANTUM INFORMATION
AB Entanglement is not only important for understanding the fundamental properties of many-body systems, but also the crucial resource enabling quantum advantages in practical information processing tasks. Although previous works on quantum networks focus on discrete-variable systems, light-as the only traveling carrier of quantum information in a network-is bosonic and thus requires a continuous-variable description. We extend the study to continuous-variable quantum networks. By mapping the ensemble-averaged entanglement dynamics on an arbitrary network to a random-walk process on a graph, we are able to exactly solve the entanglement dynamics. We identify squeezing as the source of entanglement generation, which triggers a diffusive spread of entanglement with a "parabolic light cone". A surprising linear superposition law in the entanglement growth is predicted by the theory and numerically verified, despite the nonlinear nature of the entanglement dynamics. The equilibrium entanglement distribution (Page curves) is exactly solved and has various shapes depending on the average squeezing density and strength.

TI Laser Pulses for Studying Photoactive Spin Centers with EPR
SO MICROMACHINES
AB Quantum technologies are currently being explored for various applications, including computing, secure communication, and sensor technology. A critical aspect of achieving high-fidelity spin manipulations in quantum devices is the controlled optical initialization of electron spins. This paper introduces a low-cost programming scheme based on a 32-bit STM32F373 microcontroller, aimed at facilitating high-precision measurements of optically active solid-state spin centers within semiconductor crystals (SiC, hBN, and diamond) utilizing a multi-pulse sequence. The effective shaping of short optical pulses across semiconductor and solid-state lasers, covering the visible to near-infrared range (405-1064 nm), has been validated through photoinduced electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) and electron nuclear double resonance (ENDOR) spectroscopies. The application of pulsed laser irradiation influences the EPR relaxation parameters associated with spin centers, which are crucial for advancements in quantum computing. The presented experimental approach facilitates the investigation of weak electron-nuclear interactions in crystals, a key factor in the development of quantum memory utilizing nuclear qubits.

AB Quantum devices may overcome limitations of classical computers in studies of nuclear structure functions and parton Wigner distributions of protons and nuclei. In this talk, we discuss a worldline approach to compute nuclear structure functions in the high energy Regge limit of QCD using a hybrid quantum computer, by expressing the fermion determinant in the QCD path integral as a quantum mechanical path integral over 0 + 1-dimensional fermionic and bosonic world-lines in background gauge fields. Our simplest example of computing the well-known dipole model result for the structure function F-2 in the high energy Regge limit is feasible with NISQ era technology using few qubits and shallow circuits. This example can be scaled up in complexity and extended in scope to compute structure functions, scattering amplitudes and other real-time correlation functions in QCD, relevant for example to describe non-equilibrium transport of quarks and gluons in a Quark-Gluon-Plasma.

TI Evolutionary Phases in Emerging Quantum Technologies: General
   Theoretical and Managerial Implications for Driving Technological
   Evolution
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON ENGINEERING MANAGEMENT
AB The goal of this study is to analyze the evolutionary phases of emerging technologies to improve technological forecasting and management of promising innovations. The methodology applies S-shaped models with patent data to analyze the evolutionary phases in emerging quantum technologies. In this article, findings reveal that the evolutionary cycle of recent quantum technologies, based on the patent data, is reducing compared with older technologies originated before the 1980s: from about 66 to 45 years. In addition, recent quantum technologies have a growth phase of about 22 years and a maturity phase of 11 years, a shorter period than technologies originated before the 1980s (having a growth phase of 40 years and a maturity phase of about 13 years). The measure of entropy (dispersion) in the growth phase is lower (0.64) than maturity phase (0.74): a lower diversification of technological topics and related technological trajectories. Results here suggest inductive implications that the evolution of emerging technologies, such as quantum technology, has a high complexity and uncertainty for rapid changes in the scientific and innovation ecosystem. Results also support a technological management based on an ambidexterity strategy: Exploitation strategy in the early phase of a technology's life cycle, which is characterized by concentrated topics (lower entropy measure), directed to targeted R&D investments in specific technologies. Instead, the maturity phase of technology's life cycle, having diversified themes (higher entropy measure), suggest a strategy of exploration for detecting the most promising technological directions for developing future quantum innovations among new and expanding scientific and technological domains for achieving and sustaining competitive advantage of firms and nations in a world of innovation-based competition.

TI Direct readout of a nitrogen-vacancy hybrid-spin quantum register in
   diamond by analysis of photon arrival time
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW APPLIED
AB Quantum state readout plays a pivotal role in quantum technologies, spanning applications in sensing, computation, and secure communication. In this work, we introduce an approach for efficiently reading populations of hybrid-spin states in the nitrogen-vacancy center of diamond using a single laser pulse, which utilizes the excited-state-level anticrossing mechanism at around 500 Gs. Reading spinstate populations through this approach achieves the same outcome as traditional quantum state diagonal tomography but significantly reduces the experimental time by an order of magnitude while maintaining fidelity. Moreover, this approach may be extended to encompass full-state tomography, thereby obviating the requirement for a sequence of spin manipulations and mitigating errors induced by decoherence throughout the procedure.

TI Quantum machine learning driven optimization of nutrient-hormone
   interactions for enhanced in vitro regeneration of common bean
SO BMC PLANT BIOLOGY
AB Common bean (Phaseoulus vulgarsis) is an important edible legume crop, but its improvement through modern biotechnological tools has been limited due to the lack of efficient and reproducible in vitro regeneration protocols. This bottleneck restricts the application of biotechnological applications like genetic transformation, genome editing, and crop improvement. To address the challenges, an experiment was designed to investigate the combined effect of KNO3 with Indole Butyric acid (IBA) and naphthalene acetic acid (NAA) on shoot proliferation using two different explants, followed by optimizing the results with quantum machine learning (QML) analysis. Results demonstrated enhanced shoot proliferation with increased KNO3 levels (5700 mg/L), with a shoot count of 6.44 from the shoot meristem explant in the presence of NAA. Whereas lower KNO3 concentration enlarged the shoot length. Results also revealed the impact of auxin-explant interaction, highlighting the significance of a tailored medium for in vitro regeneration. To strengthen prediction and optimization, classical and quantum machine learning (ML) algorithms were also used. A custom quantum circuit, utilizing RX, RZ, and Hadamard gates, was introduced to enhance classification accuracy using quantum superposition and entanglement principles. Results demonstrated the superior performance of a custom quantum circuit with an accuracy and F1 score of 83% and 84% respectively, for shoot counts. Whereas comparable performance was observed for shoot length classification. This hybrid computational approach not only reduced experimental uncertainty but also increased the nutrient-hormone optimization. These findings demonstrate the potential of hybrid quantum-classical approaches in plant biotechnology. The optimized in vitro system can facilitate downstream applications in plant biotechnology for breeding of legumes and other crops.

TI Probing Oxidation-Driven Amorphized Surfaces in a Ta(110) Film for
   Superconducting Qubit
SO ACS NANO
AB Recent advances in superconducting qubit technology have led to significant progress in quantum computing, but the challenge of achieving a long coherence time remains. Despite the excellent lifetime performance that tantalum (Ta) based qubits have demonstrated to date, the majority of superconducting qubit systems, including Ta-based qubits, are generally believed to have uncontrolled surface oxidation as the primary source of the two-level system loss in two-dimensional transmon qubits. Therefore, atomic-scale insight into the surface oxidation process is needed to make progress toward a practical quantum processor. In this study, the surface oxidation mechanism of native Ta films and its potential impact on the lifetime of superconducting qubits were investigated using advanced scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) techniques combined with density functional theory calculations. The results suggest an atomistic model of the oxidized Ta(110) surface, showing that oxygen atoms tend to penetrate the Ta surface and accumulate between the two outermost Ta atomic planes; oxygen accumulation at the level exceeding a 1:1 O/Ta ratio drives disordering and, eventually, the formation of an amorphous Ta2O5 phase. In addition, we discuss how the formation of a noninsulating ordered TaO1-delta (delta < 0.1) suboxide layer could further contribute to the losses of superconducting qubits. Subsurface oxidation leads to charge redistribution and electric polarization, potentially causing quasiparticle loss and decreased current-carrying capacity, thus affecting superconducting qubit coherence. The findings enhance the comprehension of the realistic factors that might influence the performance of superconducting qubits, thus providing valuable guidance for the development of future quantum computing hardware.

TI The carbon nanotube gatemon qubit
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Gate-tunable transmon qubits are based on quantum conductors used as weak links within hybrid Josephson junctions. These gatemons have been implemented in just a handful of systems, all relying on extended conductors, namely epitaxial semiconductors or exfoliated graphene. Here we present the coherent control of a gatemon based on a single molecule, a one-dimensional carbon nanotube, which is integrated into a circuit quantum electrodynamics architecture. The measured qubit spectrum can be tuned with a gate voltage and reflects the quantum dot behavior of the nanotube. Our ultraclean integration, using a hexagonal boron nitride substrate, results in record coherence times of 200 ns for carbon nanotube-based qubits. Furthermore, we investigate its decoherence mechanisms, thus revealing a strong gate dependence and identifying charge noise as a limiting factor. On top of positioning carbon nanotubes as contenders for future quantum technologies, our work paves the way for studying microscopic fermionic processes in low-dimensional quantum conductors.

TI Cryogenic memory technologies
SO NATURE ELECTRONICS
AB Cryogenic data storage technology is of use in superconducting single-flux quantum electronics and quantum computing. However, the lack of compatible cryogenic memory technology, which can operate at temperatures of 4 K (or lower), hinders the development of practical and scalable systems. Here we examine the development of cryogenic memory technologies. We explore three areas of memory technology: cryogenic non-superconducting memories (including those based on charge and resistance), superconducting memories (including those based on Josephson junctions, superconducting quantum interference devices and superconducting memristors) and hybrid memories (which use both superconducting and non-superconducting technologies). We consider the key challenges involved in the integration of such memories with single-flux quantum circuits and quantum computers. We also provide a comparison of the capabilities of the different technologies in the context of the requirements of superconducting electronics and quantum computing.
   This Review examines the development of cryogenic memory technologies-including non-superconducting memories, superconducting memories and hybrid memories-and their potential application in superconducting single-flux quantum circuits and quantum computers.

TI Hybrid quantum simulations with qubits and qumodes on trapped-ion
   platforms
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB We explore the feasibility of gate-based hybrid quantum computing using both discrete (qubit) and continuous (qumode) variables on trapped-ion platforms. Trapped-ion systems have demonstrated record one-and two-qubit gate fidelities and long qubit coherence times, while qumodes, which can be represented by the collective vibrational modes of the ion chain, have remained relatively unexplored for their use in computing. Using numerical simulations, we show that high-fidelity hybrid gates and measurement operations can be achieved for existing trapped-ion quantum platforms. As an exemplary application, we consider quantum simulations of the Jaynes-Cummings-Hubbard model, which is given by a one-dimensional chain of interacting spin and boson degrees of freedom. Using classical simulations, we study its real-time evolution and develop a suitable variational quantum algorithm for ground-state preparation. Our results should motivate further studies of hybrid quantum computing in this context, which may lead to direct applications in condensed-matter and fundamental particle and nuclear physics.

TI Garden optimization problems for benchmarking quantum annealers

AB We benchmark the 5000+ qubit system Advantage coupled with the Hybrid Solver Service 2 released by D-Wave Systems Inc. in September 2020 by using a new class of optimization problems called garden optimization problems known in companion planting. These problems are scalable to an arbitrarily large number of variables and intuitively find application in real-world scenarios. We derive their QUBO formulation and illustrate their relation to the quadratic assignment problem. We demonstrate that the Advantage system and the new hybrid solver can solve larger problems in less time than their predecessors. However, we also show that the solvers based on the 2000+ qubit system DW2000Q sometimes produce more favourable results if they can solve the problems.

TI Quantum computing of magnetic-skyrmion-like patterns in Heisenberg

SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB We diagonalize the quantum two-dimensional spin-1/2 Heisenberg model with Dzyaloshinsky-Moriya interaction (DMI) by applying the variational quantum eigensolver, running on a quantum-computer simulator, which turns out to be a more efficient approach than a classical direct diagonalization for systems with more than 17 sites. The calculated external-magnetic-field dependence of the total energy, of the magnetization, and of the topological charge exhibits a distinctive discontinuity which hints at the existence of zero-temperature magnetic-skyrmion-like structures at the quantum level, controlled by the combination of the exchange-coupling and the DMI parameters. The potentially measurable jump in the magnetization upon changing the field indicates the investigated objects are stable enough for eventual applications in spintronics or even as information carriers.

AB We propose a new kernel that quantifies success for the task of computing a core-periphery partition for an undirected network. Finding the associated optimal partitioning may be expressed in the form of a quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO) problem, to which a state-of-the-art quantum annealer may be applied. We therefore make use of the new objective function to (a) judge the performance of a quantum annealer, and (b) compare this approach with existing heuristic core-periphery partitioning methods. The quantum annealing is performed on a commercially available D-Wave machine. The QUBO problem involves a full matrix even when the underlying network is sparse. Hence, we develop and test a sparsified version of the original QUBO which increases the available problem dimension for the quantum annealer. Results are provided on both synthetic and real data sets, and we conclude that the QUBO/quantum annealing approach offers benefits in terms of optimizing this new quantity of interest.

TI Measurement-Based Control of Quantum Entanglement and Steering in a
   Distant Magnomechanical System
SO PHOTONICS
AB In this paper, we propose a scheme for measurement-based control of hybrid Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR) entanglement and steering between distant macroscopic mechanical oscillator and yttrium iron garnet (YIG) sphere in a system of an electromechanical cavity unidirectionally coupled to an electromagnonical cavity. We reveal that when the output of the electromagnonical cavity is continuously monitored by homodyne detection, not only the phonon-magnon entanglement and steering but also the purities of the phononic, magnonic and phonon-magnon states are considerably enhanced. We also find that the measurement can effectively retrieve the magnon-to-phonon steering, which is not yet obtained in the absence of the measurement. We show that unconditional phonon-magnon entanglement and steering can be achieved by introducing indirect feedback to drive the magnon and mechanical subsystems. The long-distance macroscopic hybrid entanglement and steering can be useful for, e.g., fundamental tests for quantum mechanics and quantum networks.

TI Coherent coupling in a driven qubit-magnon hybrid quantum system
SO ACTA PHYSICA SINICA
AB We experimentally demonstrate the strong coupling between the ferromagnetic magnons in an yttriumiron-garnet (YIG) sphere and the drive-field-induced dressed states of a superconducting qubit, which gives rise to the double dressing of the superconducting qubit. The YIG sphere and the superconducting qubit are embedded in a microwave cavity, and are coupled to the magnetic and electrical fields of the cavity TE102 mode, respectively. The effective coupling between them is mediated by the virtual cavity photons of cavity TE102 mode. Our experimental results indicate that as the power for driving the qubit increases, an additional split of the qubit-magnon polariton occurs. These supplemental splittings indicate a double-dressed state. We theoretically analyze the experimental results by using a particle-hole symmetric model. The theoretical results fit the experimental observations well in a broad range of drive-field power parameters, revealing that the driven qubit-magnon hybrid quantum system can be used to emulate a particle-hole symmetric pair coupled to a bosonic mode. Our hybrid quantum system holds great promise for quantum simulations of composite quasiparticles consisting of fermions and bosons.

TI Quantum homotopy perturbation method for nonlinear dissipative ordinary

SO NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB While quantum computing provides an exponential advantage in solving linear differential equations, there are relatively few quantum algorithms for solving nonlinear differential equations. In our work, based on the homotopy perturbation method, we propose a quantum algorithm for solving n-dimensional nonlinear dissipative ordinary differential equations (ODEs). Our algorithm first converts the original nonlinear ODEs into the other nonlinear ODEs which can be embedded into finite-dimensional linear ODEs. Then we solve the embedded linear ODEs with quantum linear ODEs algorithm and obtain a state epsilon-close to the normalized exact solution of the original nonlinear ODEs with success probability omega(1). The complexity of our algorithm is O(g eta T poly(log(nT/epsilon))), where eta, g measure the decay of the solution. Our algorithm provides exponential improvement over the best classical algorithms or previous quantum algorithms in n or epsilon.

This paper introduces two new classes of QEC MDS codes, which are devised through the utilization of generalized Reed-Solomon (GRS) codes and the Hermitian construction approach. The novelty of our QEC MDS codes lies in their parameters being distinct from all previously reported codes. Moreover, most of our codes possess a considerably greater minimum distance in comparison to existing codes of the same length.

TI Quantum low-density parity-check codes for erasure-biased atomic quantum
   processors
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Identifying the best families of quantum error correction (QEC) codes for near-term experiments is key to enabling fault-tolerant quantum computing. Ideally, such codes should have low overhead in qubit number, high physical error thresholds, and moderate requirements on qubit connectivity to simplify experiments, while allowing for high logical error suppression. Quantum low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes have been recently shown to provide a path towards QEC with low qubit overhead and small logical error probabilities. Here, we demonstrate that when the dominant errors are erasures, as can be engineered in different quantum computing architectures, quantum LDPC codes additionally provide high thresholds and even stronger logical error suppression in parameter regimes that are accessible to current experiments. Using large-scale QEC numerical simulations, we benchmark the performance of two families of high-rate quantum LDPC codes, namely the so-called Clifford-deformed La-cross codes and the bivariate bicycle codes, under a noise model strongly biased towards erasure errors. Both codes outperform the surface code by offering up to orders of magnitude lower logical error probabilities. Interestingly, we find that this decrease in the logical error probability may not be accompanied by an increase in the code threshold, as different QEC codes benefit differently from large erasure fractions. While here we focus on neutral atom qubits, the results also hold for other quantum platforms, such as trapped ions and superconducting qubits, for which erasure conversion has been demonstrated.

AB As a multi-particle entangled state, the Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) state plays an important role in quantum theory and applications. In this study, we propose a flexible multi-user measurement-device-independent quantum key distribution (MDI-QKD) scheme based on a GHZ entangled state. Our scheme can distribute quantum keys among multiple users while being resistant to detection attacks. Our simulation results show that the secure distance between each user and the measurement device can reach more than 280 km while reducing the complexity of the quantum network. Additionally, we propose a method to expand our scheme to a multi-node with multi-user network, which can further enhance the communication distance between the users at different nodes.

TI Theory of quantum circuits with Abelian symmetries
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Quantum circuits with gates (local unitaries) respecting a global symmetry have broad applications in quantum information science and related fields, such as condensed-matter theory and quantum thermodynamics. However, despite their widespread use, fundamental properties of such circuits are not well understood. Recently, it was found that generic unitaries respecting a global symmetry cannot be realized, even approximately, using gates that respect the same symmetry. This observation raises important open questions: What unitary transformations can be realized with k-local gates that respect a global symmetry? In other words, in the presence of a global symmetry, how does the locality of interactions constrain the possible time evolution of a composite system? In this work, we address these questions for the case of Abelian (commutative) symmetries and develop constructive methods for synthesizing circuits with such symmetries. Remarkably, as a corollary, we find that, while the locality of interactions still imposes additional constraints on realizable unitaries, certain restrictions observed in the case of non-Abelian symmetries do not apply to circuits with Abelian symmetries. For instance, in circuits with a general non-Abelian symmetry such as SU(d), the unitary realized in a subspace with one irreducible representation (charge) of the symmetry dictates the realized unitaries in multiple other sectors with inequivalent representations of the symmetry. Furthermore, in certain sectors, rather than all unitaries respecting the symmetry, the realizable unitaries are the symplectic or orthogonal subgroups of this group. We prove that none of these restrictions appears in the case of Abelian symmetries. This result suggests that global non-Abelian symmetries may affect the thermalization of quantum systems in ways not possible under Abelian symmetries.

TI Analysis of quantum key distribution based on unified model of
   sequential state discrimination strategy
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB The quantum key distribution for multiparty is one of the essential subjects of study. Especially, without using entangled states, performing the quantum key distribution for multiparty is a critical area of research. For this purpose, sequential state discrimination, which provides multiparty quantum communication and quantum key distribution for multiple receivers, has recently been introduced. Moreover, the sequential state discrimination is applicable for the security analysis against an eavesdropper's attack. In this work, we provide the security analysis of quantum key distribution by proposing a unified model of sequential state discrimination including an eavesdropper. In this model, the success probability of eavesdropping is used as a figure of merit for the security analysis. Moreover, we obtain a non-zero secret key rate between the sender and receiver, which implies that the sender and receiver can share a secret key despite the eavesdropper's scheme that optimizing the success probability of eavesdropping. Further, we propose an experimental methodology for the proposed model, which is implementable with linear optics. We observe that the secret key between the sender and receiver can be non-zero, even with imperfections.

TI Highly Sensitive Optical Time-Domain Reflectometry: Detecting 0.01 dB
   Leakage over 1000 km for Classical and Quantum Communication
SO SENSORS
AB Classical and quantum fiber-optic communication channels are vulnerable to possible intrusions. Quantum key distribution (QKD) provides a physically fundamental and theoretically secure communication method, but the key rate decays over long distances. Recently proposed by our group, a quantum communication protocol based on the physical estimation of an eavesdropper's influence shows extreme efficiency even at distances of thousands of kilometers. In this paper, we investigate the physical limits of eavesdropper detection using optical time domain reflectometry (OTDR) and demonstrate the successful detection of a 0.01 dB leakage over a distance of 1009 km.

TI Quasi-classical rules for qubit spin-rotation error suppression
SO EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB A frequently encountered source of systematic error in quantum computations is imperfections in the control pulses which are the classical fields that control qubit gate operations. From an analysis of the quantum-mechanical time-evolution operator of the spin wavefunction, it has been demonstrated that composite pulses can mitigate certain systematic errors and an appealing geometric interpretation was developed for the design of error-suppressing composite pulses. Here we show that these same pulse sequences can be obtained within a quasi-classical framework. This raises the question of whether error-correction procedures exist that exploit entanglement in a manner that can not be reproduced in the quasi-classical formulation.

TI Correlated qubit coherences stimulated by thermal energy
SO NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB Quantum coherence, the ability of a system to be in a quantum superposition of pure states, is a distinct feature of quantum mechanics that has no direct analog in classical mechanics. Quantum states that possess coherence efficiently outperform their classical counterparts in fundamental science and practical applications, including quantum metrology, computation, and simulation. Generation of coherence without the need to employ strong classical drives remains a challenging and not yet experimentally explored task. Beyond individual thermally-induced coherences already proposed for different experiments, correlated quantum coherences of multiple qubits represent a new target. We prove that correlated qubit coherence emerges thermally stimulated from incoherent states in hybrid superconducting and solid-state systems comprising non-interacting qubits coupled only via Dicke-type interaction to a shared thermal mechanical oscillator, exhibits coherences beyond the Tavis-Cummings coupling and, moreover, can be advantageous in quantum sensing.

TI A benchmarking study of quantum algorithms for combinatorial
   optimization
SO NPJ QUANTUM INFORMATION
AB We study the performance scaling of three quantum algorithms for combinatorial optimization: measurement-feedback coherent Ising machines (MFB-CIM), discrete adiabatic quantum computation (DAQC), and the D & uuml;rr-H & oslash;yer algorithm for quantum minimum finding (DH-QMF) that is based on Grover's search. We use MaxCut problems as a reference for comparison, and time-to-solution (TTS) as a practical measure of performance for these optimization algorithms. For each algorithm, we analyze its performance in solving two types of MaxCut problems: weighted graph instances with randomly generated edge weights attaining 21 equidistant values from -1 to 1; and randomly generated Sherrington-Kirkpatrick (SK) spin glass instances. We empirically find a significant performance advantage for the studied MFB-CIM in comparison to the other two algorithms. We empirically observe a sub-exponential scaling for the median TTS for the MFB-CIM, in comparison to the almost exponential scaling for DAQC and the proven O 2 n \documentclass[12pt]{minimal} \usepackage{amsmath} \usepackage{wasysym} \usepackage{amsfonts} \usepackage{amssymb} \usepackage{amsbsy} \usepackage{mathrsfs} \usepackage{upgreek} \setlength{\oddsidemargin}{-69pt} \begin{document}$$\widetilde{{{{\mathcal{O}}}}}\left(\sqrt{{2}<^>{n}}\right)$$\end{document} scaling for DH-QMF.

TI Emergent geometry through quantum entanglement in Matrix theories
SO JOURNAL OF HIGH ENERGY PHYSICS
AB In the setting of the Berenstein-Maldacena-Nastase Matrix theory, dual to light-cone M-theory in a PP-wave background, we compute the Von Neumann entanglement entropy between a probe giant graviton and a source. We demonstrate that this entanglement entropy is directly and generally related to the local tidal acceleration experienced by the probe. This establishes a new map between local spacetime geometry and quantum entanglement, suggesting a mechanism through which geometry emerges from Matrix quantum mechanics. We extend this setting to light-cone M-theory in flat space, or the Banks-Fischler-Shenker-Susskind Matrix model, and we conjecture a new general relation between a certain measure of entanglement in Matrix theories and local spacetime geometry. The relation involves a 'c-tensor' that measures the evolution of local transverse area and relates to the local energy-momentum tensor measured by a probe.

TI Quantum entanglement and statistics of photons on a beam splitter in the
   form of coupled waveguides
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB It is well known that a beam splitter (BS) can be used as a source of photon quantum entanglement. This is due to the fact that the statistics of photons changes at the output ports of the BS. Usually, quantum entanglement and photon statistics take into account the constancy of the reflection coefficient R or the transmission coefficient T of the BS, where R+T=1. It has recently been shown that if BS is used in the form of coupled waveguides, the coefficients R and T will depend on the photon frequencies. In this paper, it is shown that the quantum entanglement and statistics of photons at the output ports of a BS can change significantly if a BS is used in the form of coupled waveguides, where the coefficients R and T are frequency-dependent.

TI Material matters in superconducting qubits
SO MATERIALS SCIENCE & ENGINEERING R-REPORTS
AB The progress witnessed within the field of quantum computing has been enabled by the identification and understanding of interactions between the state of the quantum bit (qubit) and the materials within its environment. Beginning with an introduction of the parameters used to differentiate various quantum computing approaches, we discuss the evolution of the key components that comprise superconducting qubits, where the methods of fabrication can play as important a role as the composition in dictating the overall performance. We describe several mechanisms that are responsible for the relaxation or decoherence of superconducting qubits and the corresponding methods that can be utilized to characterize their influence. In particular, the effects of dielectric loss and its manifestation through the interaction with two-level systems (TLS) are discussed. We elaborate on the methods that are employed to quantify dielectric loss through the modeling of energy flowing through the surrounding dielectric materials, which can include contributions due to both intrinsic TLS and extrinsic aspects, such as those generated by processing. The resulting analyses provide insight into identifying the relative participation of specific sections of qubit designs and refinements in construction that can mitigate their impact on qubit quality factors. Additional prominent mechanisms that can lead to energy relaxation within qubits are presented along with experimental techniques which assess their importance. We close by highlighting areas of future research that should be addressed to help facilitating the successful scaling of superconducting quantum computing.

TI Implementing a deterministic search algorithm with a single qubit
SO PROGRESS OF THEORETICAL AND EXPERIMENTAL PHYSICS
AB Quantum search algorithms have important applications in quantum information, which have been experimentally demonstrated in several quantum systems with database sizes up to 16. We first propose an efficient quantum search scheme based on an optimized Grover's algorithm and a novel encoding method. With this scheme, a target element can be deterministically searched in a large database using only a single qubit. Then we implement this search scheme in linear optics with database sizes up to 40. Experimental results fit well with the theoretical results, with all fidelities greater than 99.7%. The limitation of the number of elements encoded in a single qubit is also investigated in the experiment. The experimental results indicate that a target state can be successfully searched from a database of size 36 using a single qubit in our laboratory. Since only one qubit and one-qubit gates are required, this search scheme is quite efficient and general, and can be adopted to implement the same task in most quantum systems.

It is thereby expected that all sufficiently advanced civilizations ultimately employ black holes in their quantum computers. The accompanying Hawking radiation is democratic in particle species. Due to this, the alien quantum computers will radiate in ordinary particles such as neutrinos and photons within the range of potential sensitivity of our detectors. This offers a new avenue for search for extraterrestrial intelligence, including the civilizations entirely composed of hidden particles species interacting with our world exclusively through gravity.

TI Latest research progress of quantum identity authentication
SO ACTA PHYSICA SINICA
AB The absolute security of quantum communication protocols relies on a critical premise: all participating parties are legitimate users. Ensuring the legitimacy of participant identities is paramount in complex real-world communication environments. Quantum identity authentication (QIA), in which fundamental principles of quantum mechanics are used to achieve unilateral or mutual authentication between communicating parties, constitutes an indispensable core component for building a comprehensive quantum secure communication system. It holds significant research value in the field of quantum communication. This review employs a comparative classification method to systematically outline the research trajectory of QIA protocols. By categorizing protocols based on the required quantum resources and the types of quantum protocols employed, the advantages and disadvantages of various categories are analyzed in terms of efficiency, security, and practicality. Single-photon protocols require low resources, and they are easy to implement, and compatible with existing optical components, but require high-efficiency single-photon detectors and exhibit weak noise resistance. Entangled-state protocols offer high security and strong resistance to eavesdropping, particularly suitable for long-distance or multi-party authentication. However, they greatly depend on the preparation and maintenance of high-precision, stable multi-particle entanglement sources, resulting in high experimental complexity. Continuous-variable (CV) protocols achieve high transmission efficiency in short-distance metropolitan area networks and are compatible with classical optical communication equipment, making experiments relatively straightforward. Yet, they require high-precision modulation technology and are sensitive to channel loss. Hybrid protocols aim to balance resource efficiency and security while reducing reliance on a single quantum source, but their design is complex and may introduce new attack vectors. Quantum key distribution (QKD) framework protocols embed identity authentication in the key distribution process, making them suitable for scenarios requiring long-term secure key distribution, although they often depend on pre-shared keys or trusted third parties. Quantum secure direct communication (QSDC) framework protocols integrate authentication with secure direct information transmission, offering high efficiency for realtime communication, but requiring high channel quality. Measurement-device-independent QSDC (MDI-QSDC)represents a key development direction that can resist attacks on measurement devices. Quantum teleportation (QT) framework protocols achieves cross-node authentication and unconditional security, making it suitable for quantum relay networks despite its high experimental complexity. The entanglement swapping framework protocol can resist conspiracy attacks and is suitable for multi-party joint scenarios, but it consumes a lot of resources and relies on trusted third party. Ping-pong protocol framework supports dynamic key updates and exhibits strong resistance to eavesdropping, making it suitable for temporary authentication on mobile terminals, although it typically only supports unilateral authentication and requires a bidirectional channel.
   Subsequently, this review details the latest QIA protocols of our research group, including a multi-party synchronous identity authentication protocol based on Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) states, and a tripartite QSDC protocol with identity authentication capabilities utilizing polarization-spatial super-coding. The GHZ-based multi-party synchronous authentication protocol leverages the strong correlations inherent in GHZ states to achieve simultaneous authentication among multiple parties. Through a carefully designed two-round decoy-state detection mechanism, it effectively resists both external eavesdropping and internal attacks originating from authenticated users, thereby enhancing the efficiency and security of identity management in large-scale quantum networks. The core innovation of the polarization-spatial super-coding tripartite QSDC protocol lies in its deep integration of the authentication process with information transmission by utilizing the spatial degrees of freedom of single photons. This design accomplishes the identity verification of two senders and the transmission of secret information within a single protocol run, ensuring end-to-end security through a three-stage security check. This "authentication-as-communication" paradigm significantly improves the overall efficiency and practicality of the protocol. Its successful implementation also relies on advancements in quantum memory technology. Finally, the review outlines future research directions for quantum identity authentication and explores its potential applications in quantum communication. The QIA research needs to focus on reducing resource dependency, exploring more efficient protocol designs, further enhancing protocol integration and robustness, prioritizing the development of protocols adaptable to real-world environments, and actively investigating integration with novel scenarios. This comprehensive review aims to provide theoretical research foundations and technical support for the practical development of future quantum identity authentication.

TI Quantum secured blockchain framework for enhancing post quantum data
   security
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB Quantum computing is an evolution of classical computing, capable of solving problems that are competitive enough to break the existing cryptographic primitives upon which current blockchain systems are based. Popular schemes like RSA, ECDSA, and SHA-256 can be compromised by quantum algorithms (Shor's and Grover's), raising questions about the security and trustworthiness of blockchain-based applications in finance, healthcare, and supply chains. Many current approaches focus on isolated aspects of the blockchain, such as cryptographic primitives or key exchange, without a comprehensive strategy that can guarantee end-to-end security in the face of a quantum threat. Finally, traditional consensus mechanisms such as Proof-of-Work and Proof-of-Stake are vulnerable to Sybil attacks, centralization, and leader-selection bias. When the adversary has access to a quantum computer, these issues become significantly worse. In this paper, we present QuantumShield-BC, a modular blockchain framework incorporating post-quantum cryptographic signatures, quantum key distribution (QKD), and a novel Quantum Byzantine Fault Tolerance (Q-BFT) consensus mechanism driven by quantum random number generation (QRNG) to address these challenges. QKD: The system supports tamper-proof key exchange, quantum-resilient consensus among validator nodes, and secure transaction signing. Experimental evaluation demonstrates that QuantumShield-BC achieves low consensus latency and high throughput, while providing perfect security against simulated attacks from Shor's and Grover's algorithms. The proposed framework eradicates the Sybil attack effectiveness up to 0%, eliminates replay and MITM vulnerabilities, and achieves an average throughput of over 7,000 transactions per second with 100 validators, orders of magnitude better than classical blockchain systems. The importance of each quantum part to the system's robustness is also demonstrated using an ablation study. With its unique ability to provide a post-quantum framework for high-assurance, general-purpose, scalable, and interoperable blockchain networks resistant to quantum-inspired attacks or quantum retrieval, QuantumShield-BC is practical for deployment in critical infrastructure and digital trust ecosystems where performance and a future-proof foundation are essential.

TI Toward computing bounds for Ramsey numbers using quantum annealing
SO QUANTUM INFORMATION PROCESSING
AB Quantum annealing is a powerful tool for solving and approximating combinatorial optimization problems, such as graph partitioning, community detection, centrality, routing problems, and more. In this paper we explore the use of quantum annealing as a tool for use in exploring combinatorial mathematics research problems. We consider the monochromatic triangle problem and the Ramsey number problem, both examples of graph coloring. Conversion to quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO) form is required to run on quantum hardware. While the monochromatic triangle problem is quadratic by nature, the Ramsey number problem requires the use of order reduction methods for a quadratic formulation. The goal is to provide a method for producing special colorings of graphs which if successful would provide lower bounds for certain Ramsey numbers. We discuss implementations, limitations, and results when running on the D-Wave Advantage quantum annealer.

TI LEO Satellites Constellation-to-Ground QKD Links: Greek Quantum
   Communication Infrastructure Paradigm
SO PHOTONICS
AB Quantum key distribution (QKD) has gained a lot of attention over the past few years, but the implementation of quantum security applications is still challenging to accomplish with the current technology. Towards a global-scale quantum-secured network, satellite communications seem to be a promising candidate to successfully support the quantum communication infrastructure (QCI) by delivering quantum keys to optical ground terminals. In this research, we examined the feasibility of satellite-to-ground QKD under daylight and nighttime conditions using the decoy-state BB84 QKD protocol. We evaluated its performance on a hypothetical constellation with 10 satellites in sun-synchronous Low Earth Orbit (LEO) that are assumed to communicate over a period of one year with three optical ground stations (OGSs) located in Greece. By taking into account the atmospheric effects of turbulence as well as the background solar radiance, we showed that positive normalized secure key rates (SKRs) up to 3.9x10(-4) (bps/pulse) can be obtained, which implies that satellite-to-ground QKD can be feasible for various conditions, under realistic assumptions in an existing infrastructure.

TI The Standard Model Symmetry and Qubit Entanglement
SO ENTROPY
AB Research at the intersection of quantum gravity and quantum information theory has seen significant success in describing the emergence of spacetime and gravity from quantum states whose entanglement entropy approximately obeys an area law. In a different direction, the Kaluza-Klein proposal aims to recover gauge symmetries by means of dimensional reduction in higher-dimensional gravitational theories. Integrating both of these, gravitational and gauge degrees of freedom in 3+1 dimensions may be obtained upon dimensional reduction in higher-dimensional emergent gravity. To this end, we show that entangled systems of two and three qubits can be associated with 5+1- and 9+1-dimensional spacetimes, respectively, which are reduced to 3+1 dimensions upon singling out a preferred complex direction. Depending on the interpretation of the residual symmetry, either the Standard Model gauge group, SU(3)xSU(2)xU(1)/Z6, or the symmetry of Minkowski spacetime together with the gauge symmetry of a right-handed 'half-generation' of fermions can be recovered. Thus, there seems to be a natural way to accommodate the chirality of the weak force in the given construction. This motivates a picture in which spacetime emerges from the area law contribution to the entanglement entropy, while gauge and matter degrees of freedom are obtained due to area-law-violating terms. Furthermore, we highlight the possibility of using this construction in quantum simulations of Standard Model fields.

TI From Practice To Theory: Three Types of Influence of Quantum Technology
   on Quantum Mechanics and its Foundations
SO FOUNDATIONS OF SCIENCE
AB Although quantum reality is often discussed as notoriously difficult to comprehend, quantum mechanics is applied with increasing success in the development of quantum technologies. In this paper, we collect and organise views on the influence of quantum technology on quantum mechanics and the foundations of quantum mechanics. We distinguish three types of influence: quantum technology helps in (1) understanding, (2) developing, and (3) evaluating quantum mechanics and its foundations. We outline several illustrations of these types by introducing examples. By mapping the influence of research and engineering practices in quantum technology on quantum mechanics and its foundations, this paper illuminates the interaction between the two areas. This paper suggests both how technological practices can aid in long-standing theoretical debates on understanding quantum mechanics, and how investigating the relation between quantum technology and quantum mechanics can inform understanding in the philosophy of science on the interaction between science and technology in general.

TI Rate-Compatible LDPC Codes for Continuous-Variable Quantum Key
   Distribution in Wide Range of SNRs Regime
SO ENTROPY
AB Long block length rate-compatible low-density parity-compatible (LDPC) codes are designed to solve the problems of great variation of quantum channel noise and extremely low signal-to-noise ratio in continuous-variable quantum key distribution (CV-QKD). The existing rate-compatible methods for CV-QKD inevitably cost abundant hardware resources and waste secret key resources. In this paper, we propose a design rule of rate-compatible LDPC codes that can cover all potential SNRs with single check matrix. Based on this long block length LDPC code, we achieve high efficiency continuous-variable quantum key distribution information reconciliation with a reconciliation efficiency of 91.80% and we have higher hardware processing efficiency and lower frame error rate than other schemes. Our proposed LDPC code can obtain a high practical secret key rate and a long transmission distance in an extremely unstable channel.

TI Experimental demonstration of continuous-variable quantum key
   distribution with a silicon photonics integrated receiver
SO OPTICA QUANTUM
AB Quantum key distribution (QKD) is a prominent application in the field of quantum cryptography, providing information-theoretic security for secret key exchange. The implementation of QKD systems on photonic integrated circuits (PICs) can reduce the size and cost of such systems and facilitate their deployment in practical infrastructures. To this end, continuous-variable (CV) QKD systems are particularly well-suited as they do not require single-photon detectors, whose integration is presently challenging. Here we present a CV-QKD receiver based on a silicon PIC capable of performing balanced detection. We characterize its performance in a laboratory QKD setup using a frequency multiplexed pilot scheme with specifically designed data processing allowing high modulation and secret key rates. The obtained excess noise values are compatible with asymptotic secret key rates of 2.4 Mbit/s and 220 kbit/s at an emulated distance of 10 km and 23 km, respectively. These results demonstrate the potential of this technology toward fully integrated devices suitable for high-speed, metropolitan-distance secure communication.

TI The entropic uncertainty preservation in non-Markovian environment via
   classical driving fields
SO LASER PHYSICS
AB Uncertainty relations in terms of entropies were initially proposed to deal with conceptual shortcomings in the original formulation of the uncertainty principle and, hence, play an important role in quantum foundations. In quantum information theory, the preferred mathematical quantity to express the entropic uncertainty relation is the Shannon's entropy. In this work, we investigate the effect of a classical driving field on entropic uncertainty lower bound (EULB). In this regard, we consider a particle as the quantum memory correlated with a measured particle, where during the interaction with the environment, the quantum memory is driven by the external classical field. Our result reveals that in the presence of the classical driving fields, the EULB is reduced and consequently, the measurement accuracy is increased.

TI A fixed point algorithm for improving fidelity of quantum gates
SO ESAIM-CONTROL OPTIMISATION AND CALCULUS OF VARIATIONS
AB This work considers the problem of quantum gate generation for controllable quantum systems with drift. It is assumed that an approximate solution called seed is pre-computed by some known algorithm. This work presents a method, called Fixed-Point Algorithm (FPA) that is able to improve arbitrarily the fidelity of the given seed. When the infidelity of the seed is small enough and the approximate solution is attractive in the context of a tracking control problem (that is verified with probability one, in some sense), the Banach Fixed-Point Theorem allows to prove the exponential convergence of the FPA. Even when the FPA does not converge, several iterated applications of the FPA may produce the desired fidelity. The FPA produces only small corrections in the control pulses and preserves the original bandwidth of the seed. The computational effort of each step of the FPA corresponds to the one of the numerical integration of a stabilized closed loop system. A piecewise-constant and a smooth numerical implementations are developed. Several numerical experiments with a N-qubit system illustrates the effectiveness of the method in several different applications including the conversion of piecewise-constant control pulses into smooth ones and the reduction of their bandwidth.

TI Analysis of continuous-variable quantum teleportation enhanced by
   measurement-based noiseless quantum amplification
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB Continuous -variable quantum teleportation enables deterministic teleportation of quantum states of optical modes. However, the state transfer is imperfect and limited by the amount of squeezing in the shared two -mode entangled state. Recently, it has been proposed and experimentally demonstrated that the performance of continuous -variable teleportation can be conditionally improved using a measurement -based noiseless quantum amplification [J. Zhao et al., Nat. Commun. 14, 4745 (2023)]. An inverse Gaussian filter with sufficiently high cut-off is applied to outcomes of the continuous -variable Bell measurement, which can increase the fidelity of state teleportation and the cost of making the protocol probabilistic. Here we provide a detailed theoretical analysis of this protocol and discuss its effects and limitations. We focus on teleportation of classes of Gaussian states with fixed covariance matrix and variable displacement. The measurement -based noiseless amplification conditionally improves the precision of estimation of the coherent displacement of the teleported state from the outcomes of continuous -variable Bell measurement. Therefore, more information about the teleported state is revealed and unity -gain teleportation becomes possible with a lower added thermal noise as compared to deterministic teleportation.

TI Sequential quantum circuits as maps between gapped phases
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
AB Finite-depth quantum circuits preserve the long-range entanglement structure in quantum states and map between states within a gapped phase. To map between states of different gapped phases, we can use sequential quantum circuits, which apply unitary transformations to local patches, strips, or other subregions of a system in a sequential way. The sequential structure of the circuit, on the one hand, preserves entanglement area law and hence the gappedness of the quantum states. On the other hand, the circuit has generically a linear depth, hence, it is capable of changing the long-range correlation and entanglement of quantum states and the phase they belong to. In this paper, we systematically discuss the definition, basic properties, and prototypical examples of sequential quantum circuits that map product states to Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger states, symmetry-protected topological states, intrinsic topological states, and fracton states. We discuss the physical interpretation of the power of the circuits through connection to condensation, Kramers-Wannier duality, and the notion of foliation for fracton phases.

TI Operating two exchange-only qubits in parallel
SO NATURE
AB Semiconductors are among the most promising platforms to implement large-scale quantum computers, as advanced manufacturing techniques allow fabrication of large quantum dot arrays1. Various qubit encodings can be used to store and manipulate quantum information on these quantum dot arrays. Regardless of qubit encoding, precise control over the exchange interaction between electrons confined in quantum dots in the array is critical. Furthermore, it is necessary to execute high-fidelity quantum operations concurrently to make full use of the limited coherence of individual qubits. Here we demonstrate the parallel operation of two exchange-only qubits, consisting of six quantum dots in a linear arrangement. Using randomized benchmarking (RB) techniques, we show that issuing pulses on the five barrier gates to modulate exchange interactions in a maximally parallel way maintains the quality of qubit control relative to sequential operation. The techniques developed to perform parallel exchange pulses can be readily adapted to other quantum-dot-based encodings. Moreover, we show the first, to our knowledge, experimental demonstrations of an iSWAP gate for exchange-only qubits and of a charge-locking Pauli spin blockade (PSB) readout method. The results are validated using cross-entropy benchmarking (XEB)2, a technique useful for performance characterization of larger quantum computing systems; here it is used for the first time on a quantum system based on semiconductor technology.

TI Proposal and proof-of-principle demonstration of fast-switching
   broadband frequency shifting for a frequency-multiplexed quantum
   repeater
SO JOURNAL OF THE OPTICAL SOCIETY OF AMERICA B-OPTICAL PHYSICS
AB A proposal for fast-switching broadband frequency-shifting technology making use of frequency conversion in a nonlinear crystal is set forth, whereby the shifting is imparted to the converted photons by creating a bank of frequency-displaced pump modes that can be selected by a photonic switch and directed to the nonlinear crystal. Proof-of-principle results show that the expected frequency-shifting operation can be achieved. Even though the dimensions of the currently employed crystal and significant excess loss in the experimental setup prevented conversion of single-photon-level inputs, thorough experimental and theoretical analysis of the noise contribution allowed for estimation of the system performance in an optimized scenario, where the expected signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) for single-photon conversion and frequency shifting can reach up to 25 dB with proper narrowband filtering and state-of-the-art devices. The proposed frequency-shifting solution figures as a promising candidate for applications in frequency-multiplexed quantum repeater architectures with 25 dB output SNR (with 20% conversion efficiency) and capacity for 16 channels spread around a 100 GHz spectral region.

TI Decay-protected superconducting qubit with fast control enabled by
   integrated on-chip filters
SO COMMUNICATIONS PHYSICS
AB Achieving fast gates and long coherence times for superconducting qubits presents challenges, typically requiring either a stronger coupling of the drive line or an excessively strong microwave signal to the qubit. To address this, we introduce on-chip filters of the qubit drive exhibiting a stopband at the qubit frequency, thus enabling long coherence times and strong coupling at the subharmonic frequency, facilitating fast single-qubit gates, and reduced thermal load. The filters exhibit an extrinsic relaxation time of a few seconds while enabling sub-10-ns gates with subharmonic control. Here we show up to 200-fold improvement in the measured relaxation time at the stopband. Furthermore, we implement subharmonic driving of Rabi oscillations with a pi pulse duration of 12 ns. Our demonstration of on-chip filters and efficient subharmonic driving in a two-dimensional quantum processor paves the way for a scalable qubit architecture with reduced thermal load and noise from the control line.
   Qubit development demands two conflicting requirements: good isolation from the environment and yet a strong coupling with control drive lines. This work addresses this issue, by implementing an on-chip filter that decouples a superconducting qubit from resonant modes of the environments, while achieving strong coupling with low-frequency modes.

TI Algorithm for DNA sequence assembly by quantum annealing
SO BMC BIOINFORMATICS
AB Background The assembly task is an indispensable step in sequencing genomes of new organisms and studying structural genomic changes. In recent years, the dynamic development of next-generation sequencing (NGS) methods raises hopes for making whole-genome sequencing a fast and reliable tool used, for example, in medical diagnostics. However, this is hampered by the slowness and computational requirements of the current processing algorithms, which raises the need to develop more efficient algorithms. One possible approach, still little explored, is the use of quantum computing. Results We present a proof of concept of de novo assembly algorithm, using the Genomic Signal Processing approach, detecting overlaps between DNA reads by calculating the Pearson correlation coefficient and formulating the assembly problem as an optimization task (Traveling Salesman Problem). Computations performed on a classic computer were compared with the results achieved by a hybrid method combining CPU and QPU calculations. For this purpose quantum annealer by D-Wave was used. The experiments were performed with artificially generated data and DNA reads coming from a simulator, with actual organism genomes used as input sequences. To our knowledge, this work is one of the few where actual sequences of organisms were used to study the de novo assembly task on quantum annealer. Conclusions Proof of concept carried out by us showed that the use of quantum annealer (QA) for the de novo assembly task might be a promising alternative to the computations performed in the classical model. The current computing power of the available devices requires a hybrid approach (combining CPU and QPU computations). The next step may be developing a hybrid algorithm strictly dedicated to the de novo assembly task, using its specificity (e.g. the sparsity and bounded degree of the overlap-layout-consensus graph).

TI Multireference error mitigation for quantum computation of chemistry
SO DIGITAL DISCOVERY
AB Quantum error mitigation (QEM) strategies are essential for improving the precision and reliability of quantum chemistry algorithms on noisy intermediate-scale quantum devices. Reference-state error mitigation (REM) is a cost-effective chemistry-inspired QEM method that performs well for weakly correlated problems. However, the effectiveness of REM is often limited when applied to strongly correlated systems. Here, we introduce multireference-state error mitigation (MREM), an extension of REM that systematically captures quantum hardware noise in strongly correlated ground states by utilizing multireference states. A pivotal aspect of MREM is using Givens rotations to efficiently construct quantum circuits to generate multireference states. To strike a balance between circuit expressivity and noise sensitivity, we employ compact wavefunctions composed of a few dominant Slater determinants. These truncated multireference states, engineered to exhibit substantial overlap with the target ground state, can effectively enhance error mitigation in variational quantum eigensolver experiments. We demonstrate the effectiveness of MREM through comprehensive simulations of molecular systems H2O, N2, and F2, underscoring its ability to realize significant improvements in computational accuracy compared to the original REM method. MREM broadens the scope of error mitigation to encompass a wider variety of molecular systems, including those exhibiting pronounced electron correlation.

TI Embedding Overhead Scaling of Optimization Problems in Quantum Annealing
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB In order to treat all-to-all-connected quadratic binary optimization problems (QUBOs) with hard- ware quantum annealers, an embedding of the original problem is required due to the sparsity of the topology of the hardware. The embedding of fully connected graphs-typically found in industrial applications incurs a quadratic space overhead and thus a significant overhead in the time to solution. Here, we investigate this embedding penalty of established planar embedding schemes such as square-lattice embedding, embedding on a chimera lattice, and the Lechner-Hauke-Zoller scheme, using simulated quantum annealing on classical hardware. Large-scale quantum Monte Carlo simulation suggests a polynomial time-to-solution overhead. Our results demonstrate that standard analog quantum annealing hardware is at a disadvantage in comparison to classical digital annealers, as well as gate-model quantum annealers, and could also serve as a benchmark for improvements of the standard quantum annealing protocol.

TI Temporal trapping: a route to strong coupling and deterministic optical
   quantum computation
SO OPTICA
AB The realization of deterministic photon-photon gates is a central goal in optical quantum computation and engineering. A longstanding challenge is that optical nonlinearities in scalable, room-temperature material platforms are too weak to achieve the required strong coupling, due to the critical loss-confinement trade-off in existing photonic structures. In this work, we introduce a spatio-temporal confinement method, dispersion-engineered temporal trapping, to circumvent the trade-off, enabling a route to all-optical strong coupling. Temporal confinement is imposed by an auxiliary trap pulse via cross-phase modulation, which, combined with the spatial confinement of a waveguide, creates a "flying cavity" that enhances the nonlinear interaction strength by at least an order of magnitude. Numerical simulations confirm that temporal trapping confines the multimode nonlinear dynamics to a single-mode subspace, enabling high-fidelity deterministic quantum gate operations. With realistic dispersion engineering and loss figures, we show that temporally trapped ultrashort pulses could achieve strong coupling on near-term nonlinear nanophotonic platforms. Our results highlight the potential of ultrafast nonlinear optics to become the first scalable, high-bandwidth, and room-temperature platform that achieves strong coupling, opening a path to quantum computing, simulation, and light sources.

TI Fast-forwarding with NISQ processors without feedback loop
SO QUANTUM SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB Simulating quantum dynamics is expected to be performed more easily on a quantum computer than on a classical computer. However, the currently available quantum devices lack the capability to implement fault-tolerant quantum algorithms for quantum simulation. Hybrid classical quantum algorithms such as the variational quantum algorithms have been proposed to effectively use current term quantum devices. One promising approach to quantum simulation in the noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) era is the diagonalisation based approach, with some of the promising examples being the subspace variational quantum simulator (SVQS), variational fast forwarding (VFF), fixed-state variational fast forwarding (fs-VFF), and the variational Hamiltonian diagonalisation (VHD) algorithms. However, these algorithms require a feedback loop between the classical and quantum computers, which can be a crucial bottleneck in practical application. Here, we present the classical quantum fast forwarding (CQFF) as an alternative diagonalisation based algorithm for quantum simulation. CQFF shares some similarities with SVQS, VFF, fs-VFF and VHD but removes the need for a classical-quantum feedback loop and controlled multi-qubit unitaries. The CQFF algorithm does not suffer from the barren plateau problem and the accuracy can be systematically increased. Furthermore, if the Hamiltonian to be simulated is expressed as a linear combination of tensored-Pauli matrices, the CQFF algorithm reduces to the task of sampling some many-body quantum state in a set of Pauli-rotated bases, which is easy to do in the NISQ era. We run the CQFF algorithm on existing quantum processors and demonstrate the promise of the CQFF algorithm for current-term quantum hardware. We compare CQFF with Trotterization for a XY spin chain model Hamiltonian and find that the CQFF algorithm can simulate the dynamics more than 10(5) times longer than Trotterization on current-term quantum hardware. This provides a 10(4) times improvement over the previous record.

TI A hybrid classical-quantum algorithm for solution of nonlinear ordinary
   differential equations
SO APPLIED MATHEMATICS AND COMPUTATION
AB A hybrid classical-quantum approach for the solution of nonlinear ordinary differential equations using Walsh-Hadamard basis functions is proposed. Central to this hybrid ap-proach is the computation of the Walsh-Hadamard transform of arbitrary vectors, which is enabled in our framework using quantum Hadamard gates along with state preparation, shifting, scaling, and measurement operations. It is estimated that the proposed hybrid classical-quantum approach for the Walsh-Hadamard transform of an input vector of size N results in a considerably lower computational complexity (O(N) operations) compared to the Fast Walsh-Hadamard transform (O(Nlog2(N)) operations). This benefit will also be relevant in the context of the proposed hybrid classical-quantum approach for the solu-tion of nonlinear differential equations. Comparisons of results corresponding to the pro-posed hybrid classical-quantum approach and a purely classical approach for the solution of nonlinear differential equations (for cases involving one and two dependent variables) were found to be satisfactory. Some new perspectives relevant to the natural ordering of Walsh functions (in the context of both classical and hybrid approaches for the solution of nonlinear differential equations) and the representation theory of finite groups are also presented here.(c) 2022 Elsevier Inc.

TI Provably Quantum Secure Three-Party Mutual Authentication and Key
   Exchange Protocol Based on Modular Learning with Error
SO ELECTRONICS
AB With the rapid development of quantum computers, post-quantum cryptography (PQC) has become critical technology in the security field. PQC includes cryptographic techniques that are secure against quantum-computer-based attacks, utilizing methods such as code-based, isogeny-based, and lattice-based approaches. Among these, lattice-based cryptography is the most extensively studied due to its ease of implementation and efficiency. As quantum computing advances, the need for secure communication protocols that can withstand quantum computer-based threats becomes increasingly important. Traditional two-party AKE protocols have a significant limitation: the security of the entire system can be compromised if either of the communicating parties behaves maliciously. To overcome this limitation, researchers have proposed three-party AKE protocols, where a third party acts as an arbiter or verifier. However, we found that a recently proposed three-party AKE protocol is vulnerable to quantum-computer-based attacks. To address this issue, we propose a provably quantum secure three-party AKE protocol based on MLWE. The proposed scheme leverages the user's biometric information and the server's master key to prevent the exposure of critical parameters. We analyzed the security of the protocol using simulation tools such as the Burrows-Abadi-Needham (BAN) logic, Real-or-Random (RoR) model, and Automated Validation of Internet Security Protocols and Applications (AVISPA). Furthermore, comparative analysis with similar protocols demonstrates that our protocol is efficient and suitable.

TI Asymmetric Adaptive LDPC-Based Information Reconciliation for Industrial
   Quantum Key Distribution
SO ENTROPY
AB We develop a new approach for asymmetric LDPC-based information reconciliation in order to adapt to the current channel state and achieve better performance and scalability in practical resource-constrained QKD systems. The new scheme combines the advantages of LDPC codes, a priori error rate estimation, rate-adaptive and blind information reconciliation techniques. We compare the performance of several asymmetric and symmetric error correction schemes using a real industrial QKD setup. The proposed asymmetric algorithm achieves significantly higher throughput, providing a secret key rate that is close to the symmetric one in a wide range of error rates. Thus, our approach is found to be particularly efficient for applications with high key rates, limited classical channel capacity and asymmetric computational resource allocation.

TI Quantum circuit distillation and compression
SO JAPANESE JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYSICS
AB Quantum coherence in a qubit is vulnerable to environmental noise. When long quantum calculation is run on a quantum processor without error correction, the noise causes fatal errors and messes up the calculation. Here, we propose quantum-circuit distillation to generate quantum circuits that are short but have enough functions to produce an output similar to that of the original circuits. The distilled circuits are less sensitive to the noise and can complete calculation before the quantum coherence is broken. We created a quantum-circuit distillator by building a reinforcement learning model, and applied it to the inverse quantum Fourier transform (IQFT) and Shor's quantum prime factorization. The obtained distilled circuit allows correct calculation on IBM-Quantum processors. By working with the distillator, we also found a general rule to generate quantum circuits approximating the general n-qubit IQFTs. The quantum-circuit distillator offers a new approach to improve performance of noisy quantum processors.

TI Comparative performance analysis of quantum machine learning with deep
   learning for diabetes prediction
SO COMPLEX & INTELLIGENT SYSTEMS
AB Background Diabetes, the fastest growing health emergency, has created several life-threatening challenges to public health globally. It is a metabolic disorder and triggers many other chronic diseases such as heart attack, diabetic nephropathy, brain strokes, etc. The prime objective of this work is to develop a prognosis tool based on the PIMA Indian Diabetes dataset that will help medical practitioners in reducing the lethality associated with diabetes. Methods Based on the features present in the dataset, two prediction models have been proposed by employing deep learning (DL) and quantum machine learning (QML) techniques. The accuracy has been used to evaluate the prediction capability of these developed models. The outlier rejection, filling missing values, and normalization have been used to uplift the discriminatory performance of these models. Also, the performance of these models has been compared against state-of-the-art models. Results The performance measures such as precision, accuracy, recall, F-1 score, specificity, balanced accuracy, false detection rate, missed detection rate, and diagnostic odds ratio have been achieved as 0.90, 0.95, 0.95, 0.93, 0.95, 0.95, 0.03, 0.02, and 399.00 for DL model respectively, However for QML, these measures have been computed as 0.74, 0.86, 0.85, 0.79, 0.86, 0.86, 0.11, 0.05, and 35.89 respectively. Conclusion The proposed DL model has a high diabetes prediction accuracy as compared with the developed QML and existing state-of-the-art models. It also uplifts the performance by 1.06% compared to reported work. However, the performance of the QML model has been found as satisfactory and comparable with existing literature.

TI Distant spin entanglement via fast and coherent electron shuttling
SO NATURE NANOTECHNOLOGY
AB In the quest for large-scale quantum computing, networked quantum computers offer a natural path towards scalability. While recent experiments have demonstrated nearest neighbour entanglement for electron spin qubits in semiconductors, on-chip long-distance entanglement could bring more versatility to connect quantum core units. Here, we employ the moving trapping potential of a surface acoustic wave to realize the controlled and coherent transfer of a pair of entangled electron spins between two distant quantum dots. The subsequent electron displacement induces coherent spin rotations, which drives spin quantum interferences. We observe high-contrast interference as a signature of the preservation of the entanglement all along the displacement procedure, which includes a separation of the two spins by a distance of 6 mu m. This work opens the route towards fast on-chip deterministic interconnection of remote quantum bits in semiconductor quantum circuits.
   On-chip, long-distance entanglement of spin qubits in semiconductors could enable connectivity of quantum core units for networked quantum computing. The moving trapping potential of a surface acoustic wave can subsequently displace two entangled spins while preserving entanglement over a separation of 6 mu m.

TI Simulating one-dimensional quantum chromodynamics on a quantum computer:
   Real-time evolutions of tetra- and pentaquarks
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Quantum chromodynamics (QCD)-the theory of quarks and gluons-has been studied for decades, but it is yet to be fully understood. A recent example is the prediction and experimental discovery of tetraquarks, which opened a new research field. Crucially, numerous unsolved questions regarding the standard model can exclusively be addressed by nonperturbative calculations. Quantum computers can solve problems for which well-established QCD methods are inapplicable, such as real-time evolution. We take a key step in exploring this possibility by designing a real-time evolution of tetraquark and pentaquark physics in one-dimensional SU(3) gauge theory. We also perform an experiment on a superconducting quantum computer demonstrating an elementary cell consisting of two staggered sites containing quarks and antiquarks with all three colors. This experiment represents an exciting step in quantum computation involving quarks with the gauge group of QCD.

TI Multiscale architecture for fast optical addressing and control of
   large-scale qubit arrays
SO APPLIED OPTICS
AB This paper presents a technique for rapid site-selective control of the quantum state of particles in a large array using the combination of a fast deflector (e.g., an acousto-optic deflector) and a relatively slow spatial light modu-lator (SLM). The use of SLMs for site-selective quantum state manipulation has been limited due to slow transition times that prevent rapid, consecutive quantum gates. By partitioning the SLM into multiple segments and using a fast deflector to transition between them, it is possible to substantially reduce the average time increment between scanner transitions by increasing the number of gates that can be performed for a single SLM full-frame setting. We analyzed the performance of this device in two different configurations: In configuration 1, each SLM segment addresses the full qubit array; in configuration 2, each SLM segment addresses a subarray and an additional fast deflector positions that subarray with respect to the full qubit array. With these hybrid scanners, we calculated qubit addressing rates that are tens to hundreds of times faster than using an SLM alone.(c) 2023 Optica Publishing Group

TI MQC-MB: Multiphoton Quantum Communication Using Multiple-Beam Concept in
   Free Space Optical Channel
SO SYMMETRY-BASEL
AB Multiphoton Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) has recently been proposed to exchange the secret keys using the rotational of polarization over a multi-stage protocol. It has the ability to outperform the weaknesses of a single photon QKD by improving the generation of key rate and distance range. This paper investigates the theoretical aspects of multiphoton QKD protocol's performance over free space optic (FSO) networks. The most common setup for quantum communication is the single-beam approach. However, the single-beam setup has limitations in terms of high geometrical loss. In this paper, the symmetry multiple-beam for quantum communication which is called as Multiphoton Quantum Communication-Multiple Beam (MQC-MB) is proposed to transmit the multiphoton from the sender to the receiver in order to minimize the impact of geometrical loss that is faced by the single-beam setup. The analysis was carried out through mathematical analysis by establishing the FSO quantum model with the effects of atmospheric and geometrical loss as well as considering atmospheric turbulence modeled by log-normal distribution. The design criteria of FSO, such as the transmitter, receiver, beam divergence, and diameter of apertures, are analytically investigated. The numerical results demonstrate that the MQC-MB outperforms the single-beam in terms of reducing channel loss by about 8 dB and works well under strong turbulence channel. Furthermore, the MQC-MB reduces the quantum bit error rate (QBER) and improves the secret key rate (SKR) as compared to the single-beam system even though the distance between the sender and receiver increases.

TI To reset, or not to reset-that is the question
SO NPJ QUANTUM INFORMATION
AB Whether to reset qubits, or not, during quantum error correction experiments is a question of both foundational and practical importance for quantum computing. Text-book quantum error correction demands that qubits are reset after measurement. However, fast qubit reset has proven challenging to execute at high fidelity. Consequently, many cutting-edge quantum error correction experiments are opting for the no-reset approach, where physical reset is not performed. It has recently been postulated that no-reset is functionally equivalent to reset procedures, as well as being faster and easier. For memory experiments, we confirm numerically that resetting provides no benefit. On the other hand, we identify a remarkable difference during logical operations. We find that unconditionally resetting qubits can reduce the duration of fault-tolerant logical operation by up to a factor of two as the number of measurement errors that can be tolerated is doubled. We support this with numerical simulations. However, our simulations also reveal that the no-reset performance is superior if the reset duration and infidelity exceed given thresholds. For example, with the noise model we considered, we find the no-reset performance to be superior when the reset duration is greater than approximately 100 ns and the physical error probability is greater than approximately 10-2.5 approximate to 0.003. Lastly, we introduce two novel syndrome extraction circuits that can reduce the time overhead of no-reset approaches. Our findings provide guidance on how experimentalists should design future experiments.

TI Experimental test of search range in quantum annealing
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB We construct an Ising Hamiltonian with an engineered energy landscape such that it has a local energy minimum which is near the true global minimum solution and further away from a false minimum. Using a technique established in previous experiments, we design our experiment such that (at least on timescales relevant to our study) the false minimum is reached preferentially in forward annealing due to high levels of quantum fluctuations. This allows us to demonstrate the key principle of reverse annealing, that the solution space can be searched locally, preferentially finding nearby solutions, even in the presence of a false minimum. The techniques used here are distinct from previously used experimental techniques and allow us to probe the fundamental search range of the device in an alternative way. We perform these experiments on two flux qubit quantum annealers, one with higher noise levels than the other. We find evidence that the lower noise device is more likely to find the more distant energy minimum (the false minimum in this case), suggesting that reducing noise fundamentally increases the range over which flux qubit quantum annealers are able to search. Our work explains why reducing the noise leads to improved performance on these quantum annealers. This supports the idea that these devices may be able to search over broad regions of the solution space quickly, one of the core reasons why quantum annealers are viewed as a potential avenue for a quantum computational advantage.

TI Toward perturbation theory methods on a quantum computer
SO SCIENCE ADVANCES
AB Perturbation theory, used in a wide range of fields, is a powerful tool for approximate solutions to complex problems, starting from the exact solution of a related, simpler problem. Advances in quantum computing, especially over the past several years, provide opportunities for alternatives to classical methods. Here, we present a general quantum circuit estimating both the energy and eigenstates corrections that is far superior to the classical version when estimating second-order energy corrections. We demonstrate our approach as applied to the two-site extended Hubbard model. In addition to numerical simulations based on qiskit, results on IBM's quantum hardware are also presented. Our work offers a general approach to studying complex systems with quantum devices, with no training or optimization process needed to obtain the perturbative terms, which can be generalized to other Hamiltonian systems both in chemistry and physics.

TI RC-LDPC-Polar Codes for Information Reconciliation in
   Continuous-Variable Quantum Key Distribution
SO ENTROPY
AB Continuous-variable quantum key distribution faces significant challenges, including quantum channel instability, particularly fluctuations in the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and extremely low SNR scenarios. Furthermore, non-ideal polar codes, characterized by insufficient polarization in finite-length regimes, can lead to some sub-channels being neither completely noise-free nor fully noise-dominated. This phenomenon limits the error correction capability when such codes are applied to information reconciliation. To address these challenges, we propose a novel RC-LDPC-Polar code for the CV-QKD reconciliation algorithm. We combine the error resilience of LDPC codes with the efficiency advantages of polar coding. This scheme supports adaptive rate adjustment across varying SNR conditions. Our simulation experiments demonstrate that the RC-LDPC-Polar concatenated coding scheme achieves a lower error rate under varying SNR conditions. Meanwhile, the proposed scheme achieves a higher final key rate and a longer transmission distance.

TI Quantum information processing with integrated silicon carbide photonics
SO JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYSICS
AB Color centers in wide bandgap semiconductors are prominent candidates for solid-state quantum technologies due to their attractive properties including optical interfacing, long coherence times, and spin-photon and spin-spin entanglement, as well as the potential for scalability. Silicon carbide color centers integrated into photonic devices span a wide range of applications in quantum information processing in a material platform with quantum-grade wafer availability and advanced processing capabilities. Recent progress in emitter generation and characterization, nanofabrication, device design, and quantum optical studies has amplified the scientific interest in this platform. We provide a conceptual and quantitative analysis of the role of silicon carbide integrated photonics in three key application areas: quantum networking, simulation, and computing.

TI Thermodynamic formalism for quantum channels: Entropy, pressure, Gibbs
   channels and generic properties
SO COMMUNICATIONS IN CONTEMPORARY MATHEMATICS
AB Denote M-k the set of complex k by k matrices. We will analyze here quantum channels fL of the following kind: given a measurable function L : M-k -> M-k and the measure mu on Mk we define the linear operator phi(L) : M-k -> M-k, via the expression rho -> phi(L)(rho) = integral MkL(v)rho(L)(v) d mu(v). A recent paper by T. Benoist, M. Fraas, Y. Pautrat, and C. Pellegrini is our starting point. They considered the case where L was the identity. Under some mild assumptions on the quantum channel phi(L) we analyze the eigenvalue property for phi(L) and we define entropy for such channel. For a fixed mu (the a priori measure) and for a given a Hamiltonian H : M-k (->) M-k we present a version of the Ruelle Theorem: a variational principle of pressure (associated to such H) related to an eigenvalue problem for the Ruelle operator. We introduce the concept of Gibbs channel. We also show that for a fixed mu (with more than one point in the support) the set of L such that it is phi-Erg (also irreducible) for mu is a generic set. We describe a related process X-n, n is an element of N, taking values on the projective space P(C-k) and analyze the question of the existence of invariant probabilities. We also consider an associated process rho(n), n is an element of N, with values on D-k(D-k is the set of density operators). Via the barycenter, we associate the invariant probability mentioned above with the density operator fixed for phi(L) .

TI The Second Quantum Revolution: Development of Subatomic Quantum
   Nanotechnologies of Intelligent Materials
SO EURASIAN JOURNAL OF CHEMISTRY
AB The article analyzes the future development of quantum nanotechnology based on attosecond physics of the subatomic level of the condensed state. There are considered the ways of realizing the main achievements of the second quantum revolution in subatomic nanotechnologies of materials, namely quantum entanglement, quantum contextuality and quantum dissipativity. The theoretical analysis of the prospects for this direction in the development of quantum subatomic nanotechnologies has been carried out within the framework of the well-known theory of thermal field dynamics of the condensed state. The analysis shows that subatomic en-tanglement of electron pairs is realized by attosecond single pulsed photons. The entangled electron pairs form the interfaces of supra-atomic capsules - quantum nanoelectromechanical systems (NEMS) of the con-densed state of the material. The Coulomb blockade of quantum NEMS interfaces is complemented by the fact that they are controlled by the infrastructure of subatomic two-electron sensors and actuators located at the interface boundaries. When the primary subatomic interfaces of NEMS function, secondary supra-atomic scale entangled pairs of electrons are generated, which dissipate the NEMS energy and form a dissipative multilevel hierarchy of condensed state interfaces at higher spatio-temporal scales of intelligent materials.

TI Enhancing distillability of secret keys with entanglement distillation
   and classical advantage distillation
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Realizing secure communication between distant parties is one of the main goals of quantum technology. Although quantum key distribution (QKD) promises information-theoretic security for sharing a secret key, the key rate heavily depends on the level of noise in the quantum channel. To overcome the noise, both quantum and classical techniques exist, i.e., entanglement distillation and classical advantage distillation. So far, these techniques have only been used separately from each other. Herein, we present a two-stage distillation scheme concatenating entanglement distillation with classical advantage distillation. For the advantage distillation, we utilize a fixed protocol, specifically, the repetition code; in the case of entanglement distillation, we employ an enumeration algorithm to find an optimal protocol. We test our scheme for noisy entangled states and demonstrate its quantitative advantage: Our two-stage distillation scheme achieves finite key rates even in a high-noise regime where entanglement distillation or advantage distillation alone cannot afford key sharing. We also calculate the security bounds for relevant QKD protocols with our key-distillation scheme and show that they exceed the previous security bounds on the critical quantum bit error rates with only advantage distillation. Since the advantage distillation part does not introduce further requirements for quantum resources other than those required for entanglement distillation, the proposed scheme is well suited for quantum key distribution tasks with entanglement distribution networks.

AB Quantum computing holds immense potential for solving classically intractable problems by leveraging the unique properties of quantum mechanics. The scalability of quantum architectures remains a significant challenge. Multi-core quantum architectures are proposed to solve the scalability problem, arising a new set of challenges in hardware, communications and compilation, among others. One of these challenges is to adapt a quantum algorithm to fit within the different cores of the quantum computer. This paper presents a novel approach for circuit partitioning using Deep Reinforcement Learning, contributing to the advancement of both quantum computing and graph partitioning. This work is the first step in integrating Deep Reinforcement Learning techniques into Quantum Circuit Mapping, opening the door to a new paradigm of solutions to such problems.

Cryogenic DC characterization was carried out under various back-gate voltages, V-back, from 2.95 K back to 300 K. An abrupt drop-off in drain current due to intersubband scattering is experienced in the transfer characteristic with a certain V-back. Moreover, resonant and source-to-drain tunneling transports are observed in devices with minimal channel length at cryogenic temperatures. The threshold voltage, V-T, and free carrier mobility, mu(eff), and their dependence on the back-gate voltage over a wide range of temperatures are extracted and discussed in detail. This work aims at investigating the impact of back gate potential on V-T and carrier transport at cryogenic temperatures, further paving the way towards up-scaling of quantum computers.

TI Using Deep Learning to Understand and Mitigate the Qubit Noise
   Environment
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB Understanding the spectrum of noise acting on a qubit can yield valuable information about its environment, and crucially underpins the optimization of dynamical decoupling protocols that can mitigate such noise. However, extracting accurate noise spectra from typical time-dynamics measurements on qubits is intractable using standard methods. Here, we propose to address this challenge using deep-learning algorithms, leveraging the remarkable progress made in the field of image recognition, natural language processing, and more recently, structured data. We demonstrate a neural-network-based methodology that allows for extraction of the noise spectrum associated with any qubit surrounded by an arbitrary bath, with significantly greater accuracy than the current methods of choice. The technique requires only a two-pulse echo decay curve as input data and can further be extended either for constructing customized optimal dynamical decoupling protocols or for obtaining critical qubit attributes such as its proximity to the sample surface. Our results can be applied to a wide range of qubit platforms, and provide a framework for improving qubit performance with applications not only in quantum computing and nanoscale sensing but also in material characterization techniques such as magnetic resonance.

TI Timing Constraints Due to Real-Time Graph-Traversal Algorithms on

   Computing
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW APPLIED
AB Understanding the computational overheads imposed by classical control systems on quantum comput-ing platforms becomes critically important as these quantum machines grow in scale and complexity. In this work, we calculate the overheads imposed by the implementation of real-time graph traversal algo-rithms needed to find computational paths through incomplete cluster states for the implementation of one-qubit gates; a necessary requirement for a realistic implementation of photonic measurement-based quantum computing. By implementing two different algorithms, a global breadth-first search that searches the entire cluster state and an incremental version that traverses a narrow subsection of the cluster state, we analyze the trade-off between the accuracy of finding viable paths and the speed at which this opera-tion can be performed, which constrains the overall photonic clock cycle of the system. We also outline the broader implications of our results for implementing classical control systems for measurement-based photonic quantum computing.

TI No-go theorem and a universal decomposition strategy for quantum channel
   compilation
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB We rigorously prove a no-go theorem that, in sharp contrast to the case of compiling unitary gates, it is impossible to compile an arbitrary channel to arbitrary precision with any given finite elementary channel set, regardless of the length of the decomposition sequence. However, for a fixed error bound e, we find a general and systematic strategy to compile arbitrary quantum channels. We construct a universal set with a constant number of e-dependent elementary channels, such that an arbitrary quantum channel can be decomposed into a sequence of these elementary channels followed by a unitary gate, with the sequence length bounded by O(e1 log e1 ) in the worst case. We further optimize this approach by exploiting proximal policy optimization-a powerful deep reinforcement learning algorithm for the gate compilation. We numerically evaluate the performance of our algorithm concerning topological compiling of Majorana fermions, and we show that our algorithm can conveniently and effectively reduce the use of expensive elementary operations.

TI Analysis of satellite-to-ground quantum key distribution with adaptive
   optics
SO NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB Future quantum communication infrastructures will rely on both terrestrial and space-based links integrating high-performance optical systems engineered for this purpose. In space-based downlinks in particular, the loss budget and the variations in the signal propagation due to atmospheric turbulence effects impose a careful optimization of the coupling of light in single-mode fibers required for interfacing with the receiving stations and the ground networks. In this work, we perform a comprehensive study of the role of adaptive optics (AO) in this optimization, focusing on realistic baseline configurations of prepare-and-measure quantum key distribution, with both discrete and continuous-variable encoding, and including finite-size effects. Our analysis uses existing experimental turbulence datasets at both day and night time to model the coupled signal statistics following a wavefront distortion correction with AO, and allows us to estimate the secret key rate for a range of critical parameters, such as turbulence strength, satellite altitude and ground telescope diameter. The results we derive illustrate the interest of adopting advanced AO techniques in several practical configurations.

TI Superconducting quantum circuit of NOR in quantum annealing
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB The applicability of quantum annealing to various problems can be improved by expressing the Hamiltonian using a circuit satisfiability problem. We investigate the detailed characteristics of the NOR/ NAND functions of a superconducting quantum circuit, which are the basic building blocks to implementing various types of problem Hamiltonians. The circuit is composed of superconducting flux qubits with all-to-all connectivity, where direct magnetic couplers are utilized instead of the variable couplers in the conventional superconducting quantum circuit. This configuration provides efficient scalability because the problem Hamiltonian is implemented using fewer qubits. We present an experiment with a complete logic operation of NOR/NAND, in which the circuit produces results with a high probability of success for arbitrary combinations of inputs. The features of the quantum circuit agree qualitatively with the theory, especially the mechanism for an operation under external flux modulation. Moreover, by calibrating the bias conditions to compensate for the offset flux from the surrounding circuit, the quantum circuit quantitatively agrees with the theory. To achieve true quantum annealing, we discuss the effects of the reduction in electric noise in quantum annealing.

AB A continuous-time quantum walk on a dynamic graph evolves by Schrodinger's equation with a sequence of Hamiltonians encoding the edges of the graph. This process is universal for quantum computing, but in general, the dynamic graph that implements a quantum circuit can be quite complicated. In this paper, we give six scenarios under which a dynamic graph can be simplified, and they exploit commuting graphs, identical graphs, perfect state transfer, complementary graphs, isolated vertices, and uniform mixing on the hypercube. As examples, we simplify dynamic graphs, in some instances allowing single-qubit gates to be implemented in parallel.

TI Satellite quantum communications: Fundamental bounds and practical
   security
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Satellite quantum communications are emerging within the panorama of quantum technologies as a more effective strategy to distribute completely secure keys at very long distances, therefore playing an important role in the architecture of a large-scale quantum network. In this work, we apply and extend recent results in free-space quantum communications to determine the ultimate limits at which secret (and entanglement) bits can be distributed via satellites. Our study is comprehensive of the various practical scenarios, encompassing both downlink and uplink configurations, with satellites at different altitudes and zenith angles. It includes effects of diffraction, extinction, background noise, and fading, due to pointing errors and atmospheric turbulence (appropriately developed for slant distances). Besides identifying upper bounds, we also discuss lower bounds, i.e., achievable rates for key generation and entanglement distribution. In particular, we study the composable finite-size secret key rates that are achievable by protocols of continuous variable quantum key distribution, for both downlink and uplink, showing the feasibility of this approach for all configurations. Finally, we present a study with a sun-synchronous satellite, showing that its key distribution rate is able to outperform a ground chain of ideal quantum repeaters.

TI Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev model on a noisy quantum computer
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW D
AB We study the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model -an important toy model for quantum gravity on IBM 's superconducting qubit quantum computers. By using a graph -coloring algorithm to minimize the number of commuting clusters of terms in the qubitized Hamiltonian, we find the gate complexity of the time evolution using the first -order product formula for N Majorana fermions is O ( N 5 J 2 t 2 = & varepsilon; ) where J is the dimensionful coupling parameter, t is the evolution time, and & varepsilon; is the desired precision. With this improved resource requirement, we perform the time evolution for N = 6 , 8 with maximum two-qubit circuit depth and gate count of 343. We perform different error mitigation schemes on the noisy hardware results and find good agreement with the exact diagonalization results on classical computers and noiseless simulators. In particular, we compute vacuum return probability after time t and out -of -time order correlators which is a standard observable of quantifying the chaotic nature of quantum systems.

TI An efficient multiparty quantum secret sharing scheme using a single
   qudit
SO CHINESE PHYSICS B
AB The aim of quantum secret sharing, as one of most promising components of quantum cryptograph, is one-to-multiparty secret communication based on the principles of quantum mechanics. In this paper, an efficient multiparty quantum secret sharing protocol in a high-dimensional quantum system using a single qudit is proposed. Each participant's shadow is encoded on a single qudit via a measuring basis encryption method, which avoids the waste of qudits caused by basis reconciliation. Security analysis indicates that the proposed protocol is immune to general attacks, such as the measure-resend attack, entangle-and-measure attack and Trojan horse attack. Compared to former protocols, the proposed protocol only needs to perform the single-qudit measurement operation, and can share the predetermined dits instead of random bits or dits.

TI Integration of Topological Insulator Josephson Junctions in
   Superconducting Qubit Circuits
SO NANO LETTERS
AB The integration of semiconductor Josephson junctions (JJs) in superconducting quantum circuits provides a versatile platform for hybrid qubits and offers a powerful way to probe exotic quasiparticle excitations. Recent proposals for using circuit quantum electrodynamics (cQED) to detect topological superconductivity motivate the integration of novel topological materials in such circuits. Here, we report on the realization of superconducting transmon qubits implemented with (Bi0.06Sb0.94)(2)Te-3 topological insulator (TI) JJs using ultrahigh vacuum fabrication techniques. Microwave losses on our substrates, which host monolithically integrated hardmasks used for the selective area growth of TI nanostructures, imply microsecond limits to relaxation times and, thus, their compatibility with strong-coupling cQED. We use the cavity-qubit interaction to show that the Josephson energy of TI-based transmons scales with their JJ dimensions and demonstrate qubit control as well as temporal quantum coherence. Our results pave the way for advanced investigations of topological materials in both novel Josephson and topological qubits.

AB As evolving digital ecosystems become increasingly interconnected and reliant on digital transactions, secure, private and user-centric identity solutions are garnering more spotlight than ever before. In this paper, we propose an innovative architecture that integrates quantum key distribution (QKD) with blockchain-based self-sovereign identity (SSI) systems for secure key distribution and network/user management for mobile networks with advanced 6G network capabilities. The proposed approach leverages the advanced security guarantees of QKD to ensure the confidentiality and integrity of communications and uses the decentralized and immutable nature of blockchain technology to give individuals/organizations control over their digital identities in mobile environments. We then go on to expound on the foundations of architectural components and discuss its implications for various telecom specific services and applications. Finally, we present challenges and future directions to provide quantum communication support against future digital threats and a decentralized framework for identity management with the global pursuit of more privacy-friendly and user-centric digital services, and offer comparisons with traditional approaches.

TI Public policy considerations of quantum computing
SO SCIENCE AND PUBLIC POLICY
AB Quantum computing has migrated from the desks of theoretical physicists to its operationalization by engineers and scientists. After briefly noting the limited quantum discussions in disciplinary journals specific to public policy, we review the nature of quantum mechanics for a social science audience. We separate the public policy challenges of quantum computers into two categories: its cybersecurity and national security concerns and its concerns for other sectors of public policy. This includes our identification of quantum computers as a wicked and largely unstructured policy problem. This leads to our focus on how the quantum era currently interacts with the agenda-setting and policy formulation steps of the policy cycle. The article concludes by noting potential theoretical implications along with four risks of the quantum computing era for policymakers.

TI Controlling the interfacial reactions and environment of rare-earth ions
   in thin oxide films towards wafer-scalable quantum technologies
SO MATERIALS ADVANCES
AB Rare earth (RE) doped oxides have demonstrated great potential for photonic applications and have also appeared as promising candidates for quantum memory devices and microwave to optical transducers. Here, we investigate the potential of Chemical Vapor Deposited (CVD) europium-doped Y2O3 thin films on silicon as a new platform for integrated quantum devices. We aim at improving the optical properties of such thin films by carefully controlling the RE ion's environment. In particular, we study the effect of annealing post treatments and demonstrate that a significant source of broadening of the optical transition arises from interfacial reactions with the silicon substrate. We thus propose to encapsulate RE ions between undoped high-quality thick layers in order to limit the impact of interfacial reactions on their properties during thermal annealing. Using this approach, we succeeded in measuring a narrow inhomogeneous linewidth of 18 GHz and an ultra-narrow homogeneous linewidth of 5 MHz inferred from spectral hole width. These results are promising towards the use of these engineered RE doped thin films for the development of a scalable nanostructured spin-photon interface. In addition, our strategy could be applied to a large variety of oxide films for a broad range of applications.

TI Observation of a fault tolerance threshold with concatenated codes
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB We introduce a fault-tolerant protocol for code concatenation of a generalized Shor code using a butterfly network architecture with high-noise thresholds and low ancilla overhead to allow implementation on current devices. We develop a probability passing decoder using tensor networks that applies Bayesian updates to the marginal error probabilities after each layer of checks, achieving a state-preparation threshold of ec 0.089 for erasure errors and 0.015 for unheralded noise. We implement our state-preparation protocol on ion-trap hardware with added noise to demonstrate the threshold behavior in a real quantum device. We further theoretically test the performance of our scheme as a quantum memory and for universal quantum computation through the preparation of low-noise magic states for state distillation and T-gate injection.

AB One of the biggest challenges to implement quantum protocols and quantum information processing (QIP) is achieving long coherence times, usually requiring systems at ultra-low temperatures. The nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center in diamond is a promising alternative to this problem. Due to its spin properties, easy manipulation, and the possibility of doing optical state initialization and readout, it quickly became one of the best solid-state spin systems for QIP at room temperature. Here, we present the characterization of the spin-coherence of an ensemble of NV centers in an engineered sample of ultrapure diamond as a testbed for quantum protocols for quantum metrology.

TI Midcircuit Qubit Measurement and Rearrangement in a 171Yb Atomic Array
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW X
AB Measurement-based quantum error correction relies on the ability to determine the state of a subset of qubits (ancillas) within a processor without revealing or disturbing the state of the remaining qubits. Among neutral-atom-based platforms, a scalable, high-fidelity approach to midcircuit measurement that retains the ancilla qubits in a state suitable for future operations has not yet been demonstrated. In this work, we perform maging using a narrow-linewidth transition in an array of tweezer-confined 171Yb atoms to demonstrate nondestructive state-selective and site-selective detection. By applying site-specific light shifts, selected atoms within the array can be hidden from imaging light, which allows a subset of qubits to be measured while causing only percent-level errors on the remaining qubits. As a proof-of-principle demonstration of conditional operations based on the results of the midcircuit measurements, and of our ability to reuse ancilla qubits, we perform conditional refilling of ancilla sites to correct for occasional atom loss, while maintaining the coherence of data qubits. Looking toward true continuous operation, we demonstrate loading of a magneto-optical trap with a minimal degree of qubit decoherence.

TI Electron qubits surfing on acoustic waves: review of recent progress
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICS D-APPLIED PHYSICS
AB The displacement of a single electron enables exciting avenues for nanotechnology with vast application potential in quantum metrology, quantum communication and quantum computation. Surface acoustic waves (SAW) have proven itself as a surprisingly useful solution to perform this task over large distance with outstanding precision and reliability. Over the last decade, important milestones have been achieved bringing SAW-driven single-electron transport from first proof-of-principle demonstrations to accurate, highly-controlled implementations, such as coherent spin transport, charge-to-photon conversion, or antibunching of charge states. Beyond the well-established piezoelectric gallium-arsenide platform, first realisations of acousto-electronic transport have also been carried out on the surface of liquid helium that promises unique stability and coherence. In this review article, we aim to keep track of this remarkable progress in SAW-driven transport of electron qubits by explaining these recent achievements from basic principles, with an outlook on follow-up experiments and near-term applications.

TI End-to-end demonstration for CubeSatellite quantum key distribution
SO IET QUANTUM COMMUNICATION
AB Quantum key distribution (QKD) provides a method of ensuring security using the laws of physics, avoiding the risks inherent in cryptosystems protected by computational complexity. Here, the authors investigate the feasibility of satellite-based quantum key exchange using low-cost compact nano-satellites. The first prototype of system level quantum key distribution aimed at the Cube satellite scenario is demonstrated. It consists of a transmitter payload, a ground receiver and simulated free space channel to verify the timing and synchronisation (T&S) scheme designed for QKD and the required high loss tolerance of both QKD and T&S channels. The transmitter is designed to be deployed on various up-coming nano-satellite missions in the UK and internationally. The effects of channel loss, background noise, gate width and mean photon number on the secure key rate (SKR) and quantum bit error rate (QBER) are discussed. The authors also analyse the source of QBER and establish the relationship between effective signal noise ratio (ESNR) and noise level, signal strength, gating window and other parameters as a reference for SKR optimisation. The experiment shows that it can tolerate the 40 dB loss expected in space to ground QKD and with small adjustment decoy states can be achieved. The discussion offers valuable insight not only for the design and optimisation of miniature low-cost satellite-based QKD systems but also any other short or long range free space QKD on the ground or in the air.

TI Wavelet correlation noise analysis for qubit operation variable time
   series
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB In quantum computing, characterizing the full noise profile of qubits can aid in increasing coherence times and fidelities by developing error-mitigating techniques specific to the noise present. This characterization also supports efforts in advancing device fabrication to remove sources of noise. Qubit properties can be subject to non-trivial correlations in space and time, for example, spin qubits in MOS quantum dots are exposed to noise originating from the complex glassy behavior of two-level fluctuator ensembles. Engineering progress in spin qubit experiments generates large amounts of data, necessitating analysis techniques from fields experienced in managing large data sets. Fields such as astrophysics, finance, and climate science use wavelet-based methods to enhance their data analysis. Here, we propose and demonstrate wavelet-based analysis techniques to decompose signals into frequency and time components, enhancing our understanding of noise sources in qubit systems by identifying features at specific times. We apply the analysis to a state-of-the-art two-qubit experiment in a pair of SiMOS quantum dots with feedback applied to relevant operation variables. The observed correlations serve to identify common microscopic causes of noise, such as two-level fluctuators and hyperfine coupled nuclei, as well as to elucidate pathways for multi-qubit operation with more scalable feedback systems.

TI How scanning probe microscopy can be supported by artificial
   intelligence and quantum computing?
SO MICROSCOPY RESEARCH AND TECHNIQUE
AB The impact of Artificial Intelligence (AI) is rapidly expanding, revolutionizing both science and society. It is applied to practically all areas of life, science, and technology, including materials science, which continuously requires novel tools for effective materials characterization. One of the widely used techniques is scanning probe microscopy (SPM). SPM has fundamentally changed materials engineering, biology, and chemistry by providing tools for atomic-precision surface mapping. Despite its many advantages, it also has some drawbacks, such as long scanning times or the possibility of damaging soft-surface materials. In this paper, we focus on the potential for supporting SPM-based measurements, with an emphasis on the application of AI-based algorithms, especially Machine Learning-based algorithms, as well as quantum computing (QC). It has been found that AI can be helpful in automating experimental processes in routine operations, algorithmically searching for optimal sample regions, and elucidating structure-property relationships. Thus, it contributes to increasing the efficiency and accuracy of optical nanoscopy scanning probes. Moreover, the combination of AI-based algorithms and QC may have enormous potential to enhance the practical application of SPM. The limitations of the AI-QC-based approach were also discussed. Finally, we outline a research path for improving AI-QC-powered SPM.Research Highlights Artificial intelligence and quantum computing as support for scanning probe microscopy. The analysis indicates a research gap in the field of scanning probe microscopy. The research aims to shed light into ai-qc-powered scanning probe microscopy.

TI Two-qubit Heisenberg XYZ dynamics of local quantum Fisher information,
   skew information coherence: Dyzaloshinskii-Moriya interaction and
   decoherence
SO RESULTS IN PHYSICS
AB We theoretically demonstrate how to achieve quantum entanglement control of a dissipative anisotropic two-qubit Heisenberg XYZ model. New dynamical features of local quantum coherence, local quantum Fisher information and Bures distance entanglement are achieved by controlling the initial state setting, DM interaction and decoherence. The proposed scheme allows for the generation of sudden changes in the entanglement. We illustrate the control by manipulating the local quantum coherence, Fisher information dynamics, and the sudden appearance of the disentanglement intervals. We further consider simultaneous changes in these behaviors for different values of the system parameters. These results provide helpful significance for understanding the dynamics of the dissipative anisotropic two-qubit Heisenberg XYZ model.

TI Quantum simulation of parity-time symmetry breaking with a
   superconducting quantum processor
SO COMMUNICATIONS PHYSICS
AB The observation of genuine quantum effects in systems governed by non-Hermitian Hamiltonians has been an outstanding challenge in the field. Here we simulate the evolution under such Hamiltonians in the quantum regime on a superconducting quantum processor by using a dilation procedure involving an ancillary qubit. We observe the parity-time (PT)-symmetry breaking phase transition at the exceptional points, obtain the critical exponent, and show that this transition is associated with a loss of state distinguishability. In a two-qubit setting, we show that the entanglement can be modified by local operations.

TI A glovebox-integrated confocal microscope for quantum sensing in inert
   atmosphere
SO REVIEW OF SCIENTIFIC INSTRUMENTS
AB Confocal microscopy is an invaluable tool for studying fluorescent materials and finds a wide application in biology and in quantum sensing. Usually, these experiments are performed under ambient conditions, but many materials are air sensitive (for example, black phosphorus) and degrade quickly under the strong laser irradiance. Here, we present a glovebox-integrated confocal microscope designed for nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center-based nano-scale sensing and NMR spectroscopy in an inert gas atmosphere. Using black phosphorus as a test material, we confirm that the glovebox maintains low oxygen levels and prevents material degradation during laser exposure. We demonstrate the setup's capabilities through experiments that show NV center detection and spin manipulation under a black phosphorus flake. This custom-built system enables the study of air-sensitive materials and opens new perspectives for exploring surface chemistry in a controlled environment. Our work outlines both the strengths and the challenges of using a glovebox-integrated confocal microscope for quantum technology applications.

TI Scalable surface ion trap design for magnetic quantum sensing and
   gradiometry
SO PHYSICS OPEN
AB Magnetic quantum sensors based on trapped ions utilize properties of quantum mechanics which have optimized precision and beat current limits in sensor technology. Trapped ions are highly sensitive in a large span of signal ranging from DC or static B-field to the radiofrequency range in 100s of MHz and can attain the sensitivity in the range of pT/ root Hz to sub-pT/ root Hz. They are tuneable to frequencies of interest and can be used as a lock-in frequency detector. This modelling and simulation based study presents an innovative design of Surface Paul Traps, enabling the use of trapped ions as ultra-sensitive sensors for magnetic field detection and precise measurement of magnetic field gradients at a sub-millimeter spatial resolution. The novel design features multiple trapping regions, allowing for the mapping of magnetic fields across various ion-trapping zones. The study demonstrates groundbreaking advancements in ion manipulation and confinement through innovative chip architecture.

AB Variational quantum algorithms (VQAs) show potential for quantum advantage in the near term of quantum computing, but demand a level of accuracy that surpasses the current capabilities of NISQ devices. To systematically mitigate the impact of quantum device error on VQAs, we propose Clapton: Clifford-Assisted Problem Transformation for Error Mitigation in Variational Quantum Algorithms. Clapton leverages classically estimated good quantum states for a given VQA problem, classical simulable models of device noise, and the variational principle for VQAs. It applies transformations on the VQA problem's Hamiltonian to lower the energy estimates of known good VQA states in the presence of the modeled device noise. The Clapton hypothesis is that as long as the known good states of the VQA problem are close to the problem's ideal ground state and the device noise modeling is reasonably accurate (both of which are generally true), then the Clapton transformation substantially decreases the impact of device noise on the ground state of the VQA problem, thereby increasing the accuracy of the VQA solution. Clapton is built as an end-to-end application-to-device framework and achieves mean VQA initialization improvements of 1.7x to 3.7x, and up to a maximum of 13.3x, over the state-of-the-art baseline when evaluated for a variety of scientific applications from physics and chemistry on noise models and real quantum devices.

TI Programmable Heisenberg interactions between Floquet qubits
SO NATURE PHYSICS
AB The trade-off between robustness and tunability is a central challenge in the pursuit of quantum simulation and fault-tolerant quantum computation. In particular, quantum architectures are often designed to achieve high coherence at the expense of tunability. Many current qubit designs have fixed energy levels and consequently limited types of controllable interactions. Here by adiabatically transforming fixed-frequency superconducting circuits into modifiable Floquet qubits, we demonstrate an XXZ Heisenberg interaction with fully adjustable anisotropy. This interaction model can act as the primitive for an expressive set of quantum operations, but is also the basis for quantum simulations of spin systems. To illustrate the robustness and versatility of our Floquet protocol, we tailor the Heisenberg Hamiltonian and implement two-qubit iSWAP, CZ and SWAP gates with good estimated fidelities. In addition, we implement a Heisenberg interaction between higher energy levels and employ it to construct a three-qubit CCZ gate, also with a competitive fidelity. Our protocol applies to multiple fixed-frequency high-coherence platforms, providing a collection of interactions for high-performance quantum information processing. It also establishes the potential of the Floquet framework as a tool for exploring quantum electrodynamics and optimal control.
   External driving of qubits can exploit their nonlinearity to generate different forms of interqubit interactions, broadening the capabilities of the platform.

TI Entanglement Distillation Optimization Using Fuzzy Relations for Quantum
   State Tomography
SO ALGORITHMS
AB Practical entanglement distillation is a critical component in quantum information theory. Entanglement distillation is often utilized for designing quantum computer networks and quantum repeaters. The practical entanglement distillation problem is formulated as a bilevel optimization problem. A fuzzy formulation is introduced to estimate the quantum state (density matrix) from pseudo-likelihood functions (i.e., quantum state tomography). A scale-independent relationship between fuzzy relations in terms of the pseudo-likelihood functions is obtained. The entanglement distillation optimization problem is solved using the combined coupled map lattice and dual annealing approach. Comparative analysis of the results is then conducted against a standard dual annealing algorithmic implementation.

TI Real-space entanglement in the Cosmic Microwave Background
SO JOURNAL OF COSMOLOGY AND ASTROPARTICLE PHYSICS
AB We compute the entanglement entropy, mutual information and quantum discord of the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) fluctuations in real space. To that end, we first show that measurements of these fluctuations at two distinct spatial locations can be described by a bipartite, continuous Gaussian system. This leads to explicit formulas for the mutual information and the quantum discord in terms of the Fourier-space power spectra of the curvature perturbation. We then find that quantum entanglement, that builds up in Fourier space between opposite wave momenta as an effect of quantum squeezing, is transferred to real space. In particular, both the mutual information and quantum discord, which decay as the fourth power of the distance between the two measurements in flat space time, asymptotes a constant in cosmological backgrounds. At the scales probed in the CMB however, they are highly suppressed, while they can reach order-one values at much smaller scales, where primordial black holes could have formed.

TI Resource estimations for the Hamiltonian simulation in correlated
   electron materials
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Correlated electron materials, such as superconductors and magnetic materials, are regarded as fascinating targets in quantum computing. However, the quantitative resources, specifically the number of quantum gates and qubits, required to perform a quantum algorithm to simulate correlated electron materials remain unclear. In this study, we estimate the resources required for the Hamiltonian simulation algorithm for correlated electron materials, specifically for organic superconductors, iron-based superconductors, binary transition-metal oxides, and perovskite oxides, using the fermionic SWAP network. The effective Hamiltonian derived using the ab initio downfolding method is adopted for the Hamiltonian simulation, and a procedure for the resource estimation by using the fermionic SWAP network for the effective Hamiltonians including the exchange interactions is proposed. For example, in the system for the 10(2) unit cells, the estimated numbers of gates per Trotter step and qubits are approximately 10(7) and 10(3), respectively, on average for the correlated electron materials. Furthermore, our results show that the number of interaction terms in the effective Hamiltonian, especially for the Coulomb interaction terms, is dominant in the gate resources when the number of unit cells constituting the whole system is up to 10(2), whereas the number of fermionic SWAP operations is dominant when the number of unit cells is more than 10(3).

TI Enhancing a convolutional autoencoder with a quantum approximate
   optimization algorithm for image noise reduction
SO MACHINE LEARNING-SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB Image denoising is essential for removing noise in images caused by electric device malfunctions or other factors during image acquisition. It ensures the preservation of image quality and accurate interpretation. Many convolutional autoencoder algorithms have proven effective in image denoising. Owing to their promising efficiency, quantum computers have gained popularity. This paper proposes a method, the quantum convolutional autoencoder (QCAE), which enhances traditional convolutional autoencoders by replacing their latent space with a quantum counterpart implemented via a quantum approximate optimization algorithm (QAOA)-inspired ansatz circuit. To enhance efficiency, we leveraged the advantages of the QAOA-incorporated parameter-shift rule to identify an optimized cost function, facilitating effective learning from data and gradient computation on an actual quantum computer. The proposed QCAE method outperformed its classical counterpart as it exhibited lower training loss and a higher structural similarity index (SSIM) value. QCAE also outperformed its classical counterpart in denoising the MNIST dataset by up to 40% in terms of SSIM value, confirming its enhanced capabilities in real-world applications. Evaluation of QAOA performance across different circuit configurations and layer variations showed that our technique outperformed other circuit designs by 25% on average.

TI Quantization of two- and three-player cooperative games based on QRA
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICS A-MATHEMATICAL AND THEORETICAL
AB In this paper, a novel quantization scheme for cooperative games is proposed. The circuit is inspired by the Eisert-Wilkens-Lewenstein protocol, which was modified to represent cooperation between players and extended to 3-qubit states. The framework of Clifford algebra is used to perform necessary computations. In particular, we use a direct analogy between Dirac formalism and Quantum Register Algebra (QRA) to represent circuits. This analogy enables us to perform automated proofs of the circuit equivalence in a simple fashion. The expected value of the Shapley value concerning quantum probabilities is employed to distribute players' payoffs after the measurement. We study how entanglement, representing the level of pre-agreement between players, affects the final utility distribution. The paper also demonstrates how the QRA and GAALOP software can automate all necessary calculations.

Our aim is to evaluate the performance of the D-Wave Advantage machine in addressing these complex challenges. We selected instances from the literature for these two problems based on the machine's capacity, specifically considering its number of qubits and the topology of its qubit network. For the Max-Cut problem, we utilise a fully quantum approach, employing an Ising model to find optimal solutions. For the CVRP, we adopt a hybrid quantum-classical methodology, following a cluster first-route second scheme. Our findings suggest that quantum computers are a promising tool for rapidly solving optimisation problems, although we observed limitations in terms of scalability.

TI Possibilistic simulation of quantum circuits by classical circuits

Their result is equivalent to saying that a particular family of constant-depth quantum circuits takes classical circuits at least Omega(log n) depth to "simulate," in a certain sense. In our paper, we formalize their sense of simulation, which we call "possibilistic simulation" or "p-simulation," and construct explicit classical circuits that can p-simulate any depth-d quantum circuit with Clifford and t T-gates in depth O(d + t). Our classical circuits use {NOT, AND, OR} gates of fan-in <= 2.

TI Variational Quantum Singular Value Decomposition
SO QUANTUM
AB Singular value decomposition is central to many problems in engineering and scientific fields. Several quantum algorithms have been proposed to determine the singular values and their associated singular vectors of a given matrix. Although these algorithms are promising, the required quantum subroutines and resources are too costly on near-term quantum devices. In this work, we propose a variational quantum algorithm for singular value decomposition (VQSVD). By exploiting the variational principles for singular values and the Ky Fan Theorem, we design a novel loss function such that two quantum neural networks (or parameterized quantum circuits) could be trained to learn the singular vectors and output the corresponding singular values. Furthermore, we conduct numerical simulations of VQSVD for random matrices as well as its applications in image compression of handwritten digits. Finally, we discuss the applications of our algorithm in recommendation systems and polar decomposition. Our work explores new avenues for quantum information processing beyond the conventional protocols that only works for Hermitian data, and reveals the capability of matrix decomposition on near-term quantum devices.

TI An Image Localization System Based on Single Photon
SO CMC-COMPUTERS MATERIALS & CONTINUA
AB As an essential part of artificial intelligence, many works focus on image processing which is the branch of computer vision. Nevertheless, image localization faces complex challenges in image processing with image data increases. At the same time, quantum computing has the unique advantages of improving computing power and reducing energy consumption. So, combining the advantage of quantum computing is necessary for studying the quantum image localization algorithms. At present, many quantum image localization algorithms have been proposed, and their efficiency is theoretically higher than the corresponding classical algorithms. But, in quantum computing experiments, quantum gates in quantum computing hardware need to work at very low temperatures, which brings great challenges to experiments. This paper proposes a single-photon-based quantum image localization algorithm based on the fundamental theory of single-photon image classification. This scheme realizes the operation of the mixed national institute of standards and technology database (MNIST) quantum image localization by a learned transformation for non-noise condition, noisy condition, and environmental attack condition, respectively. Compared with the regular use of entanglement between multi-qubits and low-temperature noise reduction conditions for image localization, the advantage of this method is that it does not deliberately require low temperature and entanglement resources, and it improves the lower bound of the localization success rate. This method paves a way to study quantum computer vision.

TI Partial stability of induced entanglement in an off-resonance
   qutrit-cavity system with nonlinear coupling and intrinsic decoherence
SO ALEXANDRIA ENGINEERING JOURNAL
AB In this article, we introduce an analytical description for the nonlinear off-resonance qutrit-cavity system through intensity-dependent nonlinear coupling under intrinsic decoherence. When the cavity is initially in coherent and even coherent states. The dynamics of the negativity entanglement, in the off-resonance qutrit-cavity system, is investigated under the physical parameters of the qutrit-cavity detuning, the intrinsic decoherence as well as the initial cavity coherent states. It is found that the ability of the off-resonance qutrit-cavity interaction to generate the entanglement, depends on the physical parameters. The high nonclassicality of the even coherent state can enhance the generated entanglement and its stability. For the intrinsic decoherence, the amount and the stability of the generated qutrit-cavity entanglement can be controlled by the coherent field intensity of the initial cavity states.

TI Experimental quantum learning of a spectral decomposition
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Currently available quantum hardware allows for small-scale implementations of quantum machine learning algorithms. Such experiments aid the search for applications of quantum computers by benchmarking the nearterm feasibility of candidate algorithms. Here we demonstrate the quantum learning of a two-qubit unitary by a sequence of three parameterized quantum circuits containing a total of 21 variational parameters. Moreover, we variationally diagonalize the unitary to learn its spectral decomposition, i.e., its eigenvalues and eigenvectors. We illustrate how this can be used as a subroutine to compress the depth of dynamical quantum simulations. One can view our implementation as a demonstration of entanglement-enhanced machine learning, as only a single (entangled) training data pair is required to learn a 4 x 4 unitary matrix.

TI Activating hidden teleportation power: Theory and experiment
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Ideal quantum teleportation transfers an unknown quantum state intact from one party Alice to the other Bob via the use of a maximally entangled state and the communication of classical information. If Alice and Bob do not share entanglement, the maximal average fidelity between the state to be teleported and the state received, according to a classical measure-and-prepare scheme, is upper bounded by a function f(c) that is inversely proportional to the Hilbert space dimension. In fact, even if they share entanglement, the so-called teleportation fidelity may still be less than the classical threshold f(c). For two-qubit entangled states, conditioned on a successful local filtering, the teleportation fidelity can always be activated, i.e., boosted beyond f(c). Here, for all dimensions larger than two, we show that the teleportation power hidden in a subset of entangled two-qudit Werner states can also be activated. In addition, we show that an entire family of two-qudit rank-deficient states violates the reduction criterion of separability, and thus their teleportation power is either above the classical threshold or can be activated. Using hybrid entanglement prepared in photon pairs, we also provide the first proof-of-principle experimental demonstration of the activation of teleportation power hidden in this latter family of qubit states. The connection between the possibility of activating hidden teleportation power with the closely-related problem of entanglement distillation is discussed.

TI Switching, amplifying, and chirping diode lasers with current pulses for
   high bandwidth quantum technologies
SO REVIEW OF SCIENTIFIC INSTRUMENTS
AB A series of simple and low-cost devices for switching, amplifying, and chirping diode lasers based on current modulation are presented. Direct modulation of diode laser currents is rarely sufficient to establish precise amplitude and phase control over light, as its effects on these parameters are not independent. These devices overcome this limitation by exploiting amplifier saturation and dramatically outperform commonly used external modulators in key figures of merit for quantum technological applications. Semiconductor optical amplifiers operated on either rubidium D line are recast as intensity switches and shown to achieve ON:OFF ratios >10(6) in as little as 50 ns. Current is switched to a 795 nm wavelength (Rb D-1) tapered amplifier to produce optical pulses of few nanosecond duration and peak powers of 3 W at a similar extinction ratio. Fast rf pulses are applied directly to a laser diode to shift its emission frequency by up to 300 MHz in either direction and at a maximum chirp rate of 150 MHz ns(-1). Finally, the latter components are combined, yielding a system that produces watt-level optical pulses with arbitrary frequency chirps in the given range and <2% residual intensity variation, all within 65 ns upon asynchronous demand. Such systems have broad application in atomic, molecular, and optical physics and are of particular interest to fast experiments simultaneously requiring high power and low noise, for example, quantum memory experiments with atomic vapors.

TI Using a Deep Quantum Neural Network to Enhance the Fidelity of Quantum
   Convolutional Codes
SO APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL
AB The fidelity of quantum states is an important concept in quantum information. Improving quantum fidelity is very important for both quantum communication and quantum computation. In this paper, we use a quantum neural network (QNN) to enhance the fidelity of [6, 2, 2] quantum convolutional codes. Towards the circuit of quantum convolutional codes, the target quantum state vertical bar 0 > or vertical bar 1 > is turned into entangled quantum states, which can defend against quantum noise more effectively. As the quantum neural network works better for quantum states with low dimension, we divide the quantum circuits into two parts. Then we apply the quantum neural network to each part of the circuit. The results of the simulation show that the network performs well in enhancing the fidelity of the quantum states. Through the quantum neural network, the fidelity of the first part is enhanced from 95.2% to 99.99%, and the fidelity of the second part is enhanced from 93.88% to 94.57%.

TI Multifunctional on-chip storage a telecommunication wavelength for
   quantum networks
SO OPTICA
AB Quantum networks will enable a variety of applications, from secure communication and precision measurements to distributed quantum computing. Storing photonic qubits and controlling their frequency, bandwidth, and retrieval time are important functionalities in future optical quantum networks. Here we demonstrate these functions using an ensemble of erbiu ions in yttrium orthosilicate coupled to a silicon photonic resonator and controlled via onchip electrodes. Light in the telecommunication C-band is stored, manipulated, and retrieved using a dynamic atomic frequency comb protocol controlled by linear DC Stark shifts of the ion ensemble's transition frequencies. We demonstrate memory time control in a digital fashion in increments of 50 ns, frequency shifting by more than a pulse width (+/- 39 MHz), and a bandwidth increase by a factor of 3, from 6 to 18 MHz. Using on-chip electrodes, electric fields as high as 3 kV/cm were achieved with a low applied bias of 5 V, making this an appealing platform for rare-earth ions, which experience Stark shifts of the order of 10 kHz/(V/cm).

TI Lightweight ASIP Design for Lattice-Based Post-quantum Cryptography
   Algorithms
SO ARABIAN JOURNAL FOR SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING
AB Lattice-based cryptography (LBC) algorithms are considered suitable candidates for post-quantum cryptography (PQC), as they dominate the standardization process put forward by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). Indeed, three of the four key encapsulation mechanism (KEM) algorithms in the third round of the process are based on computationally hard lattice problems. On the other hand, there is an urgent need for processor designs that can run PQC algorithms efficiently, especially for embedded systems. This study presents an application-specific instruction set processor (ASIP) design for the Kyber, Saber, and NewHope algorithms based on transport triggered architecture (TTA). Custom hardware accelerators are added to the baseline processor architecture for computation-intensive steps without applying any software optimization to the reference code. We compared FPGA and ASIC implementations of our design with the prominent RISC-V cores and instruction set extension studies in the literature. According to the results, the proposed design offers greater efficiency, better performance, and lower resource utilization than its competitors in most cases.

TI From Field Effect Transistors to Spin Qubits: Focus on Group IV
   Materials, Architectures and Fabrications
SO NANOMATERIALS
AB In this review, we focus on group IV one-dimensional devices for quantum technology. We outline the foundational principles of quantum computing before delving into materials, architectures and fabrication routes, separately, by comparing the bottom-up and top-down approaches. We demonstrate that due to easily tunable composition and crystal/interface quality and relatively less demanding fabrications, the study of grown nanowires such as core-shell Ge-Si and Ge hut wires has created a very fruitful field for studying unique and foundational quantum phenomena. We discuss in detail how these advancements have set the foundations and furthered realization of SETs and qubit devices with their specific operational characteristics. On the other hand, top-down processed devices, mainly as Si fin/nanowire field-effect transistor (FET) architectures, showed their potential for scaling up the number of qubits while providing ways for very large-scale integration (VLSI) and co-integration with conventional CMOS. In all cases we compare the fin/nanowire qubit architectures to other closely related approaches such as planar (2D) or III-V qubit platforms, aiming to highlight the cutting-edge benefits of using group IV one-dimensional morphologies for quantum computing. Another aim is to provide an informative pedagogical perspective on common fabrication challenges and links between common FET device processing and qubit device architectures.

TI Classical-quantum simulation of non-equilibrium Marshak waves
SO JOURNAL OF PLASMA PHYSICS
AB In the radiation hydrodynamic simulations used to design inertial confinement fusion (ICF) and pulsed power experiments, nonlinear radiation diffusion tends to dominate CPU time. This raises the interesting question of whether a quantum algorithm can be found for nonlinear radiation diffusion which provides a quantum speedup. Recently, such a quantum algorithm was introduced based on a quantum algorithm for solving systems of nonlinear partial differential equations (PDEs) which provides a quadratic quantum speedup. Here, we apply this quantum PDE (QPDE) algorithm to the problem of a non-equilibrium Marshak wave propagating through a cold, semi-infinite, optically thick target, where the radiation and matter fields are not assumed to be in local thermodynamic equilibrium. The dynamics is governed by a coupled pair of nonlinear PDEs which are solved using the QPDE algorithm, as well as two standard PDE solvers: (i) Python's py-pde solver; and (ii) the KULL ICF simulation code developed at Lawrence-Livermore National Laboratory. We compare the simulation results obtained using the QPDE algorithm and the standard PDE solvers and find excellent agreement.

TI Evaluating NTT/INTT Implementation Styles for Post-Quantum Cryptography

AB Unifying the forward and inverse operations of the number theoretic transform (NTT) into a single hardware module is a common practice when designing polynomial coefficient multiplier accelerators as used in the post-quantum cryptographic algorithms. This letter experimentally evaluates that this design unification is not always advantageous. In this context, we present three NTT hardware architectures: 1) a forward NTT (FNTT) architecture; 2) an inverse NTT (INTT) architecture; and 3) a unified NTT (UNTT) architecture for computing the FNTT and INTT computations on a single design. We benchmark our throughput/area and energy/area evaluations on Xilinx Virtex-7 field-programmable gate array (FPGA) and 28-nm application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) platforms. The standalone FNTT and INTT designs, on average on FPGA, exhibit 4.66x and 3.75x higher throughput/area and energy/area values, respectively, than the UNTT design. Similarly, the individual FNTT and INTT designs, on average on ASIC, achieve 1.25x and 1.09x higher throughput/area and energy/area values, respectively, compared to the UNTT design.

AB Quantum computing is in an era of limited resources. Current hardware lacks high fidelity gates, long coherence times, and the number of computational units required to perform meaningful computation. Contemporary quantum devices typically use a binary system, where each qubit exists in a superposition of the | 0 > and | 1 > states. However, it is often possible to access the |2 > or even |3 > states in the same physical unit by manipulating the system in different ways. In this work, we consider automatically encoding two qubits into one four-state ququart via a compression scheme. We use quantum optimal control to design efficient proof-of-concept gates that fully replicate standard qubit computation on these encoded qubits. We extend qubit compilation schemes to efficiently route qubits on an arbitrary mixed-radix system consisting of both qubits and ququarts, reducing communication and minimizing excess circuit execution time introduced by longer-duration ququart gates. In conjunction with these compilation strategies, we introduce several methods to find beneficial compressions, reducing circuit error due to computation and communication by up to 50%. These methods can increase the computational space available on a limited nearterm machine by up to 2x while maintaining circuit fidelity.

TI First-principles screening of metal-organic frameworks for entangled
   photon pair generation
SO MATERIALS FOR QUANTUM TECHNOLOGY
AB The transmission of strong laser light in nonlinear optical materials can generate output photons sources that carry quantum entanglement in multiple degrees of freedom, making this process a fundamentally important tool in optical quantum technology. However, the availability of efficient optical crystals for entangled light generation is severely limited in terms of diversity, thus reducing the prospects for the implementation of next-generation protocols in quantum sensing, communication and computing. To overcome this, we developed and implemented a multi-scale first-principles modeling technique for the computational discovery of novel nonlinear optical devices based on metal-organic framework (MOF) materials that can efficiently generate entangled light via spontaneous parametric down-conversion (SPDC). Using collinear degenerate type-I SPDC as a case study, we computationally screen a database of 114 373 synthesized MOF materials to establish correlations between the structure and chemical composition of MOFs with the brightness and coherence properties of entangled photon pairs. We identify a subset of 49 non-centrosymmetric mono-ligand MOF crystals with high chemical and optical stability that produce entangled photon pairs with intrinsic G(2) correlation times tau c similar to 10-30 fs and pair generation rates in the range 104-1010s-1mW-1mm-1 at 1064 nm. Conditions for optimal type-I phase matching are given for each MOF and relationships between pair brightness, crystal band gap and optical birefringence are discussed. Correlations between the optical properties of crystals and their constituent molecular ligands are also given. Our work paves the way for the computational design of MOF-based devices for optical quantum technology.

We describe a general procedure to construct efficient quantum circuits for the cost function evaluation required by VQAs. To mitigate the barren plateau problem during the optimization, we propose an adaptive multigrid strategy. The approach is illustrated for the nonlinear Burgers equation. We classically optimize quantum circuits to represent the desired ground-state solutions, run them on IBM Q System One and Quantinuum System Model H1, and demonstrate that current quantum computers are capable of accurately reproducing the exact results.

TI Beyond-classical computation in quantum simulation
SO SCIENCE
AB Quantum computers hold the promise of solving certain problems that lie beyond the reach of conventional computers. However, establishing this capability, especially for impactful and meaningful problems, remains a central challenge. Here, we show that superconducting quantum annealing processors can rapidly generate samples in close agreement with solutions of the Schrodinger equation. We demonstrate area-law scaling of entanglement in the model quench dynamics of two-, three-, and infinite-dimensional spin glasses, supporting the observed stretched-exponential scaling of effort for matrix-product-state approaches. We show that several leading approximate methods based on tensor networks and neural networks cannot achieve the same accuracy as the quantum annealer within a reasonable time frame. Thus, quantum annealers can answer questions of practical importance that may remain out of reach for classical computation.

TI Probabilistic Amplitude Shaping for Continuous-Variable Quantum Key
   Distribution With Discrete Modulation Over a Wiretap Channel
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON COMMUNICATIONS
AB To achieve the maximum information transfer and face a possible eavesdropper, the samples transmitted in continuous-variable quantum key distribution (CV-QKD) protocols are to be drawn from a continuous Gaussian distribution. As a matter of fact, in practical implementations the transmitter has a finite (power) dynamics and the Gaussian sampling can be only approximated. This requires the quantum protocols to operate at small powers. In this paper, we show that a suitable probabilistic amplitude shaping of a finite set of symbols allows to approximate at will the optimal channel capacity also for increasing average powers. We investigate the feasibility of this approach in the framework of CV-QKD, propose a protocol employing discrete quadrature amplitude modulation assisted with probabilistic amplitude shaping, and we perform the key generation rate analysis assuming a wiretap channel and lossless homodyne detection.

AB LF-mu SR studies have previously been used to study the diffusive 1D motion of solitons and polarons in conducting polymers. This type of study was also applied to investigating the diffusive motion of spinons in spin-1/2 antiferromagnetic chains. Recently the method has been extended to examples of 2D layered triangular spin lattices which can support quantum spin liquid states, such as 1T-TaS2 and YbZnGaO4. These systems are found to show spin dynamics that matches well to 2D spin diffusion, such a model being found to provide a much better fit to the data than previously proposed models for spin correlations in such systems. In YbZnGaO4 the diffusion rate shows a clear crossover between classical and quantum regimes as T falls below the exchange coupling J. That the spin diffusion approach works well in the high T classical region might be expected, but it is found that it also works equally well in the low T quantum region where quantum entanglement controls the spin dynamics. Measurement of the diffusion rate allows a T dependent length scale to be derived from the data that can be assigned to a quantum entanglement length xi E. Another entanglement measure, the Quantum Fisher Information FQ can also be obtained from the data and its T dependence is compared to that of xi E.

TI Estimating quantum mutual information through a quantum neural network
SO QUANTUM INFORMATION PROCESSING
AB We propose a method of quantum machine learning called quantum mutual information neural estimation (QMINE) for estimating von Neumann entropy and quantum mutual information, which are fundamental properties in quantum information theory. The QMINE proposed here basically utilizes a technique of quantum neural networks (QNNs), to minimize a loss function that determines the von Neumann entropy, and thus quantum mutual information, which is believed more powerful to process quantum datasets than conventional neural networks due to quantum superposition and entanglement. To create a precise loss function, we propose a quantum Donsker-Varadhan representation (QDVR), which is a quantum analog of the classical Donsker-Varadhan representation. By exploiting a parameter shift rule on parameterized quantum circuits, we can efficiently implement and optimize the QNN and estimate the quantum entropies using the QMINE technique. Furthermore, numerical observations support our predictions of QDVR and demonstrate the good performance of QMINE.

TI Universal Pulses for Superconducting Qudit Ladder Gates
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB Qudits, generalizations of qubits to multilevel quantum systems, offer enhanced computational efficiency by encoding more information per lattice cell, avoiding costly swap operations and providing even exponential speedup in some cases. Utilizing the d-level manifold, however, requires high-speed gate operations because of the stronger decoherence at higher levels. While analytical control methods have proven effective for qubits in achieving fast gates with minimal control errors, their extension to qudits is nontrivial due to the increased complexity of the energy-level structure arising from additional ancillary states. In this work, we present a universal pulse construction for generating rapid, high-fidelity unitary rotations between adjacent qudit levels, thereby providing a prescription for any gate in SU(d). Control errors in these operations are effectively analyzed within a four-level subspace, including two leakage levels with approximately opposite detuning. By identifying the optimal degrees of freedom, we derive concise analytical pulse schemes that suppress multiple control errors and outperform existing methods. Remarkably, our approach achieves consistent coherent error scaling across all levels, approaching the quantum speed limit independently of parameter variations between levels. Numerical validation on transmon circuits demonstrates significant improvements in gate fidelity for various qudit sizes aiming for 10-4 error. This method provides a scalable solution for improving qudit control and can be broadly applied to other quantum systems with ladder structures or operations involving multiple ancillary levels.

TI Quantum state transfer on 1-dimensional and 2-dimensional topological
   Heisenberg spin models
SO RESULTS IN PHYSICS
AB The geometrical significance of winding number is used to study the topological characteristics of a single-excitation Heisenberg XY spin model represented by the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) model. Due to the presence of topological edge states, the quantum state may be conveyed from the first site to the last site with a high degree of fidelity. Also examined is a Heisenberg XY model on the kagome lattice. In the topological phase of the kagome lattice, the three corner states are not affected by the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya (DM) interactions. For the kagome lattice with and without the DM interactions, the state of a spin on one corner site can be transferred to the other two corner sites in various ways during the topological phase. The quantum state transfer (QST) for the XY model on the kagome lattice without the DM interactions is symmetrical and can only produce a three-body entangled state. In contrast, the QST for the XY model on the kagome lattice with the DM interactions is in an asymmetrical form, similar to one-way propagation, and it can produce both product states and three-body entangled states.

SO JOURNAL OF HIGH ENERGY PHYSICS
AB In this study, we explore the real-time dynamics of the chiral magnetic effect (CME) at a finite temperature in the (1+1)-dimensional QED, the massive Schwinger model. By introducing a chiral chemical potential mu 5 through a quench process, we drive the system out of equilibrium and analyze the induced vector currents and their evolution over time. The Hamiltonian is modified to include the time-dependent chiral chemical potential, thus allowing the investigation of the CME within a quantum computing framework. We employ the quantum imaginary time evolution (QITE) algorithm to study the thermal states, and utilize the Suzuki-Trotter decomposition for the real-time evolution. This study provides insights into the quantum simulation capabilities for modeling the CME and offers a pathway for studying chiral dynamics in low-dimensional quantum field theories.

TI Quantum Computation of Molecular Structure Using Data from
   Challenging-To-Classically-Simulate Nuclear Magnetic Resonance
   Experiments
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB We propose a quantum algorithm for inferring the molecular nuclear spin Hamiltonian from time-resolved measurements of spin-spin correlators, which can be obtained via nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR). We focus on learning the anisotropic dipolar term of the Hamiltonian, which generates dynamics that are challenging to classically simulate in some contexts. We demonstrate the ability to directly estimate the Jacobian and Hessian of the corresponding learning problem on a quantum computer, allowing us to learn the Hamiltonian parameters. We develop algorithms for performing this computation on both noisy near-term and future fault-tolerant quantum computers. We argue that the former is promising as an early beyond-classical quantum application since it only requires evolution of a local spin Hamiltonian. We investigate the example of a protein (ubiquitin) confined on a membrane as a benchmark of our method. We isolate small spin clusters, demonstrate the convergence of our learning algorithm on one such example, and then investigate the learnability of these clusters as we cross the ergodic to nonergodic phase transition by suppressing the dipolar interaction. We see a clear correspondence between a drop in the multifractal dimension measured across many-body eigenstates of these clusters, and a transition in the structure of the Hessian of the learning cost function (from degenerate to learnable). Our hope is that such quantum computations might enable the interpretation and development of new NMR techniques for analyzing molecular structure.

TI A first-principles investigation of halogen doped diamond and its
   application to quantum technologies
SO JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYSICS
AB Defect centers in diamond have attracted considerable attention for the development of emerging quantum technologies, for example, quantum sensors and spin qubits. Nitrogen vacancy (NV) is the most well-studied and utilized defect; however, its relatively high zero phonon line (ZPL) is responsible for optical losses and limiting efficiency. Here, we focus on the halogen doping in diamond, employing the strongly constrained and appropriately normed meta-generalized gradient approximation functional to investigate the thermodynamic and electronic properties of these defects. We analyzed all stable charge states at their lowest energy spin state and identified qubit candidates with paramagnetic ground states and optically addressable transitions, suitable for quantum applications. We focus on the fluorine substitutional defect at negative charge (F-C(-1)), which we found as a promising spin-defect that has not been extensively investigated before. We predict that it has a triplet ground state and a ZPL much lower compared to the NV center that falls into the desired telecommunication range. To describe its qubit operation protocol, we calculate the zero-field splitting and the hyperfine tensors. The present findings suggest that F-c has very promising properties and could be a viable alternative to traditional qubits in diamond.

To perform quantum annealing analysis with real variables, representation of real numbers as a sum of random number combinations is employed. The nodal displacement is expressed with binary variables. The Hamiltonian H is formulated on the basis of the elastic strain energy and position energy of a truss structure. It is confirmed that truss deformation analysis is possible by quantum annealing. For the analysis of the optimization method for the truss structure, the cross-sectional area of the truss is expressed with binary variables. The iterative calculation for the changes in displacement and cross-sectional area leads to the optimal structure under the prescribed boundary conditions.

SO PHYSICS LETTERS A
AB Geometric properties of evolutionary graph states of spin systems generated by the operator of evolution with Ising Hamiltonian are examined, using their relationship with fluctuations of energy. We find that the geometric characteristics of the graph states depend on properties of the corresponding graphs. Namely, it is obtained that the fluctuations of energy in graph states and therefore the velocity of quantum evolution, the curvature, and the torsion of the states are related to the total number of edges, triangles, and squares in the corresponding graphs. The obtained results give a possibility to quantify the number of edges, triangles, and squares in a graph on a quantum devise and achieve quantum supremacy in solving this problem with the development of a multi-qubit quantum computer. Geometric characteristics of graph states corresponding to a chain, a triangle, and a square are detected on the basis of calculations on IBM's quantum computer ibmq_manila. (C) 2022 Elsevier B.V.

TI AI support meets AR visualization for Alice and Bob: personalized
   learning based on individual ChatGPT feedback in an AR quantum
   cryptography experiment for physics lab courses
SO EPJ QUANTUM TECHNOLOGY
AB Quantum cryptography is a central topic in the quantum technology field that is particularly important for secure communication. The training of qualified experts in this field is necessary for continuous development. However, the abstract and complex nature of quantum physics makes the topic difficult to understand. Augmented reality (AR) allows otherwise invisible abstract concepts to be visualized and enables interactive learning, offering significant potential for improving quantum physics education in university lab courses. In addition, personalized feedback on challenging concepts can facilitate learning, and large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT can effectively deliver such feedback. This study combines these two aspects and explores the impact of an AR-based quantum cryptography experiment with integrated ChatGPT-based feedback on university students' learning outcomes and cognitive processes. The study involved 21 groups (11 Group A; 10 Group B) of students in a physics laboratory course at a German university and used four open-ended questions to measure learning outcomes and gaze data as a learning process assessment. Statistical analysis was used to compare scores between feedback and non-feedback questions, and the effect of ChatGPT feedback on eye-tracking data was examined. The results show that ChatGPT feedback significantly improved learning outcomes and affected gaze data. While the feedback on conceptual questions tended to direct attention to the visualizations of the underlying model, the feedback on questions about experimental procedures increased visual attention to the real experimental materials. Overall, the results show that AI-based feedback draws visual attention towards task-relevant factors and increases learning performance in general.

TI Quantum steering transfer within quantum network
SO NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB Quantum steering is the ability that one system affects another one without delay by performing local measurements, which has garnered significant attention in the field of quantum information science. Here, we propose a linear network to realize tunable quantum steering with adjustable measurements. We show that forward steering of the first entangled source can be perfectly transferred to the state of two endpoints, regardless of measurements in the quantum network. However, for the backward steering between two endpoints, it displays a four-leaf clovers with rich symmetries with measurement parameters {theta j}j=1N-1 and is dependent on the parameters {beta j}j=2N of the input state. By tuning the measurements far away from or close to the optimal values, one-way or two-way steering can be controllably realized. In addition, the error between the actual and optimal measurements is also taken into account in our proposal. The result indicates that a smaller error is beneficial for predicting two-way steering involving multiple measurements. Our proposal offers a promising way to realize the quantum steering transfer within linear networks.

TI Device-Independent Quantum Key Distribution with Arbitrarily Small
   Nonlocality
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB Device-independent quantum key distribution allows two users to set up shared cryptographic key without the need to trust the quantum devices used. Doing so requires nonlocal correlations between the users. However, in Farkas et al. [Phys. Rev. Lett. 127, 050503 (2021)] it was shown that for known protocols nonlocality is not always sufficient, leading to the question of whether there is a fundamental lower bound on the minimum amount of nonlocality needed for any device-independent quantum key distribution implementation. Here, we show that no such bound exists, giving schemes that achieve key with correlations arbitrarily close to the local set. Furthermore, some of our constructions achieve the maximum of 1 bit of key per pair of entangled qubits. We achieve this by studying a family of Bell inequalities that constitute all self-tests of the maximally entangled state with a single linear Bell expression. Within this family there exist nonlocal correlations with the property that one pair of inputs yield outputs arbitrarily close to perfect key. Such correlations exist for a range of Clauser-Horne-ShimonyHolt values, including those arbitrarily close to the classical bound. Finally, we show the existence of quantum correlations that can generate both perfect key and perfect randomness simultaneously, while also displaying arbitrarily small Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt violation. This opens up the possibility of a new class of cryptographic protocol.

TI Quantum Two-Way Protocol Beyond Superdense Coding: Joint Transfer of
   Data and Entanglement
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON QUANTUM ENGINEERING
AB In this article, we introduce a generalization of one-way superdense coding to two-way communication protocols for transmitting classical bits by using entangled quantum pairs. The proposed protocol jointly addresses the provision of entangled pairs and superdense coding, introducing an integrated approach for managing entanglement within the communication protocol. To assess the performance of the proposed protocol, we consider its data rate and resource usage, and we analyze this both in an ideal setting with no decoherence and in a more realistic setting where decoherence must be taken into account. In the ideal case, the proposal offers a 50% increase in both data rate and resource usage efficiency compared to conventional protocols. Even when decoherence is taken into consideration, the quantum protocol performs better as long as the decoherence time is not extremely short. Finally, we present the results of implementing the protocol in a computer simulation based on the NetSquid framework. We compare the simulation results with the theoretical values.

TI Discrete modulation continuous-variable measurement-device-independent
   quantum key distribution scheme based onrealistic detector compensation
SO ACTA PHYSICA SINICA
AB Discrete modulation continuous variable measurement device independent quantum key distributionscheme has good compatibility with efficient error correction codes, which leads to high reconciliation efficiencyeven at low signal-to-noise ratio. Besides, the implementation of this protocol is simpler than that of Gaussianmodulation scheme. However, the quantum efficiency of homodyne detector commonly used in the experiment isonly 0.6, which will seriously affect the practical application performance of discrete modulation continuousvariable measurement device independent quantum key distribution scheme. To solve this problem, we proposea discrete modulation continuous variable measurement device independent quantum key distribution schemebased on realistic detector compensation. In our scheme, for the outputs of two quantum channels, each adoptsa phase sensitive amplifier to compensate for the corresponding realistic homodyne detector. The simulationresults show that the phase sensitive amplifier can well compensate for the quantum efficiency of the realisticdetector and effectively improve the performance of the discrete modulation continuous variable measurementdevice independent quantum key distribution scheme with realistic detector in terms of secret key rate andsecure transmission distance. The proposed protocol provides an effective method for promoting the practicaldevelopment of the discrete modulation continuous variable measurement device independent quantum keydistribution scheme

TI High-fidelity remote entanglement between superconducting
   fixed-frequency qubits
SO NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB Highly accurate quantum state transfer and remote entanglement between superconducting fixed-frequency qubits have not yet been realized. In this study, we calculate the characteristics of a transmission path with a 1- or 0.25 m superconducting coaxial cable and use the characteristics to perform time evolution simulations of quantum state transfer and remote entanglement between superconducting fixed-frequency qubits. We find that remote entanglement, or half-quantum state transfer, can achieve a high fidelity >99% even in the presence of a qubit frequency detuning caused by manufacturing fluctuations, while a small qubit frequency detuning substantially reduces the efficiency of quantum state transfer. Quantum circuit simulations modeling proposed remote entanglement demonstrate that teleportation of a logical qubit with a 3x3 surface code, as an example of computation using remote entanglement, attains nearly the same fidelity as in-node computation for both 1- and 0.25 m cable lengths.

TI Statistical Mechanical Mapping and Maximum-Likelihood Thresholds for the
   Surface Code under Generic Single-Qubit Coherent Errors
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB The surface code, one of the leading candidates for quantum error correction, is known to protect encoded quantum information against stochastic, i.e., incoherent errors. The protection against coherent errors, such as from unwanted gate rotations, is however understood only for special cases, such as rotations about the X or Z axes. Here we consider generic single-qubit coherent errors in the surface code, i.e., rotations by angle alpha about an axis that can be chosen arbitrarily. We develop a statistical mechanical mapping for such errors and perform entanglement analysis in transfer matrix space to numerically establish the existence of an error-correcting phase, which we chart in a subspace of rotation axes to estimate the corresponding maximum-likelihood thresholds alpha( th). The classical statistical mechanics model we derive is a random-bond Ising model with complex couplings and four-spin interactions (i.e., a complex-coupled Ashkin-Teller model). The error-correcting phase, alpha <alpha( th), where the logical error rate decreases exponentially with code distance, is shown to correspond in transfer matrix space to a gapped one-dimensional quantum Hamiltonian exhibiting spontaneous breaking of a Z(2) symmetry. Our numerical results rest on two key ingredients: (i) we show that the state evolution under the transfer matrix, a nonunitary (1 +1)-dimensional quantum circuit, can be efficiently numerically simulated using matrix product states; and (ii) based on this approach, we also develop an algorithm to (approximately) sample syndromes based on their Born probability. The alpha( th) values we find show that the maximum-likelihood thresholds for coherent errors are larger than those for the corresponding incoherent errors (from the Pauli twirl), and significantly exceed the values found using minimum weight perfect matching.

TI Limits of Noisy Quantum Metrology with Restricted Quantum Controls
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB The Heisenberg limit [(HL), with estimation error scales as 1/n] and the standard quantum limit (SQL, proportional to 1/ffiffi p n ) are two fundamental limits in estimating an unknown parameter in n copies of quantum channels and are achievable with full quantum controls, e.g., quantum error correction (QEC). It is unknown though, whether these limits are still achievable in restricted quantum devices when QEC is unavailable, e.g., with only unitary controls or bounded system sizes. In this Letter, we discover various new limits for estimating qubit channels under restrictive controls. The HL is shown to be unachievable in various cases, indicating the necessity of QEC in achieving the HL. Furthermore, a necessary and sufficient condition to achieve the SQL is determined, where a single-qubit unitary control protocol is identified to achieve the SQL for certain types of noisy channels, and for other cases a constant floor on the estimation error is proven. A practical example of the unitary protocol is provided.

TI Closed-System Solution of the 1D Atom from Collision Model
SO ENTROPY
AB Obtaining the total wavefunction evolution of interacting quantum systems provides access to important properties, such as entanglement, shedding light on fundamental aspects, e.g., quantum energetics and thermodynamics, and guiding towards possible application in the fields of quantum computation and communication. We consider a two-level atom (qubit) coupled to the continuum of travelling modes of a field confined in a one-dimensional chiral waveguide. Originally, we treated the light-matter ensemble as a closed, isolated system. We solve its dynamics using a collision model where individual temporal modes of the field locally interact with the qubit in a sequential fashion. This approach allows us to obtain the total wavefunction of the qubit-field system, at any time, when the field starts in a coherent or a single-photon state. Our method is general and can be applied to other initial field states.

TI Fidelity and entanglement of random bipartite pure states: insights and
   applications
SO PHYSICA SCRIPTA
AB We investigate the fidelity of Haar random bipartite pure states from a fixed reference quantum state and their bipartite entanglement. By plotting the fidelity and entanglement on perpendicular axes, we observe that the resulting plots exhibit non-uniform distributions. The distribution depends on the entanglement of the fixed reference quantum state used to quantify the fidelity of the random pure bipartite states. We find that the average fidelity of typical random pure bipartite qubits within a narrow entanglement range with respect to a randomly chosen fixed bipartite qubit is 1 4 . Extending our study to higher dimensional bipartite qudits, we find that the average fidelity of typical random pure bipartite qudits with respect to a randomly chosen fixed bipartite qudit remains constant within a narrow entanglement range. The values of these constants are 1 d 2 , with d being the dimension of the local Hilbert space of the bipartite qudit system, suggesting a consistent relationship between entanglement and fidelity across different dimensions. The probability distribution functions of fidelity with respect to a product state are analytically studied and used as a reference for the benchmarking of distributed quantum computing devices.

TI Relativistic quantum communication between harmonic oscillator detectors
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW D
AB We propose a model of communication employing two harmonic oscillator detectors interacting through a scalar field in a background Minkowski spacetime. In this way, the scalar field plays the role of a quantum channel, namely a bosonic Gaussian channel. The classical and quantum capacities of the communication channel are found, assuming that the detectors' spatial dimensions are negligible compared to their distance. In particular, we study the evolution in time of the classical capacity after the detectors-field interaction is switched on for various detectors' frequencies and coupling strengths with the field. As a result, we find a finite value of these parameters optimizing the communication of classical messages. Instead, a reliable communication of quantum messages turns out to be always inhibited.

This uncertainty in the work extraction process can be addressed by resorting to the expected utility hypothesis, which can provide an optimal method for work extraction. We study a bipartite quantum system and examine the role of quantum correlations in a daemonic work extraction performed by certain local operations and classical communication. Specifically, we demonstrate and explain how, depending on the so-called absolute risk aversion, a non -neutral risk agent, influenced by fluctuations, views quantum correlations differently from a neutral risk agent that is affected solely by the average work.

TI Robustness of quantum correlation in quantum energy teleportation
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW D
AB In this article, we explore a feedback-control protocol in different quantum field theories (QFTs) to study the quantum correlation in nonunitary evolution of quantum systems. Traditional studies on QFTs focus on quantum entanglement of pure states under the unitary evolution, however, we examine quantum correlation in mixed states using quantum energy teleportation (QET), which is an energy transfer protocol by utilizing ground state entanglement, and introduce quantum discord as a measure. QET involves a midcircuit measurement, which disrupts pure state entanglement. Despite this, our analysis demonstrates that quantum discord maintains the correlation throughout the QET process. We conducted numerical analyses with benchmark models including the Nambu-Jona-Lasinio (NJL) model, revealing that quantum discord consistently acts as an order parameter for phase transitions. The model is extended in a way that it has both the chiral chemical potential and the chemical potential, which are useful to study the phase structures mimicking the chiral imbalance between left- and right- quarks coupled to the chirality density operator. In all cases we studied, the quantum discord behaved as an order parameter of the phase transition.

SO PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY CHEMICAL PHYSICS
AB The simulation of chemical reactions is an anticipated application of quantum computers. Using a Diels-Alder reaction as a test case, in this study we explore the potential applications of quantum algorithms and hardware in investigating chemical reactions. Our specific goal is to calculate the activation barrier of a reaction between ethylene and cyclopentadiene forming a transition state. To achieve this goal, we use quantum algorithms for near-term quantum hardware (entanglement forging and quantum subspace expansion) and classical post-processing (many-body perturbation theory) in concert. We conduct simulations on IBM quantum hardware using up to 8 qubits, and compute accurate activation barrier in the reaction between cyclopentadiene and ethylene by accounting for both static and dynamic electronic correlation. This work illustrates a hybrid quantum-classical computational workflow to study chemical reactions on near-term quantum devices, showcasing the potential for performing quantum chemistry simulations on quantum hardware to predict activation barriers in agreement with those predicted by CASCI.

TI Quantum computing and the stable set problem
SO OPTIMIZATION METHODS & SOFTWARE
AB Given an undirected graph, the stable set problem asks to determine the cardinality of the largest subset of pairwise non-adjacent vertices. This value is called the stability number of the graph, and its computation is an NP-hard problem. In this paper, we solve the stable set problem using the D-Wave quantum annealer. By formulating the problem as a quadratic unconstrained binary optimization problem with the penalty method, we show its optimal value equals the graph's stability number for specific penalty values. However, D-Wave's quantum annealer is a heuristic, so the solutions may be far from the optimum and may not represent stable sets. To address these, we introduce a post-processing procedure that identifies samples that could lead to improved solutions. Additionally, we propose a partitioning method to handle larger instances that cannot be embedded on D-Wave's quantum processing unit. Finally, we investigate how different penalty parameter values affect the solutions' quality. Extensive computational results show that the post-processing procedure significantly improves the solution quality, while the partitioning method successfully extends our approach to medium-size instances.

TI A hybrid quantum annealing method for generating ensemble classifiers
SO JOURNAL OF KING SAUD UNIVERSITY-COMPUTER AND INFORMATION SCIENCES
AB Quantum annealing has been widely used to optimize machine learning such as ensemble classifiers. This ensemble classifier enhances classification performance through the combination of multiple accurate and diverse base classifiers. It benefits from the "perturb and combine" strategy which involves using the random subspace as the prevalent approach to perturb input data. There are several methods to generate a random subspace which include bagging, boosting, clustering, and, more recently, clustering balancing. The main contribution of this research was to improve the accuracy of the ensemble classifier using the hybrid quantum annealing method. The process involved making larger, stronger, and more balanced clusters through 1) the modification of the range of values from K in incremental clustering, 2) the adjustment of the clusters to be stronger and more balanced, and 3) the optimization of pure-class clusters using quantum annealing. The proposed method was tested and evaluated on 10 benchmark datasets from the UCI repository and the results were compared with current approaches. The results showed that the proposed method has better accuracy than the others due to the larger, stronger, and more balanced clusters generated as well as the better trade-off between accuracy and diversity.

TI Photon storage and routing in quantum dots with spin-orbit coupling
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB As an essential element for quantum information processing and quantum communication, efficient quantum memory based on solid-state platforms is imperative for practical applications but remains a challenge. Here we propose a scheme to realize a highly efficient and controllable storage and routing of single photons based on quantum dots (QDs) with a Rashba spin-orbit coupling (SOC). We show that the SOC in the QDs can provide a flexible built-up of electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT) for single-photon propagation, and storage, retrieval, as well as routing of single-photon wavepackets can also be implemented through the EIT. Moreover, we demonstrate that the propagation loss of the single-photon wavepackets in the QDs may be largely suppressed by means of a weak microwave field, by which the storage and routing of the single photons can be made to have high efficiency and fidelity. Our research opens a route for designs of advanced solid-state devices promising for applications in photonic quantum-information processing and transmission based on the QDs with SOC.

TI Efficient Hardware Arithmetic for Inverted Binary Ring-LWE Based
   Post-Quantum Cryptography
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON CIRCUITS AND SYSTEMS I-REGULAR PAPERS
AB Ring learning-with-errors (RLWE)-based encryption scheme is a lattice-based cryptographic algorithm that constitutes one of the most promising candidates for Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC) standardization due to its efficient implementation and low computational complexity. Binary Ring-LWE (BRLWE) is a new optimized variant of RLWE, which achieves smaller computational complexity and higher efficient hardware implementations. In this paper, two efficient architectures based on Linear-Feedback Shift Register (LFSR) for the arithmetic used in Inverted Binary Ring-LWE (InvBRLWE)-based encryption scheme are presented, namely the operation of A center dot B+C over the polynomial ring Z(q)/(x(n)+1)$ . The first architecture optimizes the resource usage for major computation and has a novel input processing setup to speed up the overall processing latency with minimized input loading cycles. The second architecture deploys an innovative serial-in serial-out processing format to reduce the involved area usage further yet maintains a regular input loading time-complexity. Experimental results show that the architectures presented here improve the complexities obtained by competing schemes found in the literature, e.g., involving 71.23% less area-delay product than recent designs. Both architectures are highly efficient in terms of area-time complexities and can be extended for deploying in different lightweight application environments.

TI Bounds on quantum information storage and retrieval
SO PHILOSOPHICAL TRANSACTIONS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY A-MATHEMATICAL PHYSICAL
   AND ENGINEERING SCIENCES
AB We present certain universal bounds on the capacity of quantum information storage and on the time scale of its retrieval for a generic quantum field theoretic system. The capacity, quantified by the microstate entropy, is bounded from above by the surface area of the object measured in units of a Goldstone decay constant. The Goldstone bosons are universally present due to the spontaneous breaking of Poincare and internal symmetries by the information-storing object. Applied to a black hole, the bound reproduces the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy. However, the relation goes beyond gravity. The minimal time-scale required for retrieving the quantum information from a system is equal to its volume measured in units of the same Goldstone scale. For a black hole, this reproduces the Page time as well as the quantum break-time. Again, the expression for the information retrieval time is very general and is shared by non-gravitational saturated states in gauge theories including QCD. All such objects exhibit universal signatures such as the emission of ultra-soft radiation. Similar bounds apply to non-relativistic many-body systems. This article is part of the theme issue 'Quantum technologies in particle physics'.

TI An approach for security evaluation and certification of a complete
   quantum communication system
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB Although quantum communication systems are being deployed on a global scale, their realistic security certification is not yet available. Here we present a security evaluation and improvement protocol for complete quantum communication systems. The protocol subdivides a system by defining seven system implementation sub-layers based on a hierarchical order of information flow; then it categorises the known system implementation imperfections by hardness of protection and practical risk. Next, an initial analysis report lists all potential loopholes in its quantum-optical part. It is followed by interactions with the system manufacturer, testing and patching most loopholes, and re-assessing their status. Our protocol has been applied on multiple commercial quantum key distribution systems to improve their security. A detailed description of our methodology is presented with the example of a subcarrier-wave system. Our protocol is a step towards future security evaluation and security certification standards.

TI A Cryo-CMOS PLL for Quantum Computing Applications
SO IEEE JOURNAL OF SOLID-STATE CIRCUITS
AB This article presents the first cryogenic phase-locked loop (PLL) operating at 4.2 K. The PLL is designed for the control system of scalable quantum computers. The specifications of PLL are derived from the required control fidelity for a single-qubit operation. By considering the benefits and challenges of cryogenic operation, a dedicated analog PLL structure is used so as to maintain high performance from 300 to 4.2 K. The PLL incorporates a dynamic-amplifier-based charge-domain sub-sampling phase detector (PD), which simultaneously achieves low phase noise (PN) and low reference spur, thanks to its high phase-detection gain and minimized periodic disturbances on the voltage-controlled oscillator (VCO) control. Fabricated in a 40-nm CMOS process, the PLL achieves -78.4-dBc reference spur, 75-fs rms jitter, and 4-mW power consumption at 300 K when generating a 10-GHz carrier, leading to a -256.5-dB jitter-power FOM. At 4.2 K, the PLL synthesizes 9.4-to 11.6-GHz tones with an rms jitter of 37 fs and a reference spur of -69 dBc while consuming 2.7 mW at 10 GHz.

TI Equilibrium and nonequilibrium quantum correlations between two
   accelerated detectors
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW D
AB We quantify the quantum correlations between two accelerated detectors coupled to a scalar field in a cavity. It has been realized that an accelerated detector will experience a thermal bath, which is termed the Unruh effect. We examine the similarities and differences for quantum correlations regarding either temperature or acceleration. As the accelerations (respective temperatures) of the detectors increase, the entanglement decreases to zero at some instant but the mutual information (respective discord) can be amplified. As the accelerations increase but are in opposite directions, the quantum correlations decay. Importantly, we also reveal that larger quantum correlations can appear in certain nonequilibrium scenarios in which either the acceleration difference or the coupling difference becomes significant.

TI Engineering Dynamical Sweet Spots to Protect Qubits from 1/f Noise
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW APPLIED
AB Protecting superconducting qubits from low-frequency noise is essential for advancing superconducting quantum computation. Based on the application of a periodic drive field, we develop a protocol for engineering dynamical sweet spots, which reduce the susceptibility of a qubit to low-frequency noise. Using the framework of Floquet theory, we prove rigorously that there are manifolds of dynamical sweet spots marked by extrema in the quasienergy differences of the driven qubit. In particular, for the example of fluxonium biased slightly away from half a flux quantum, we predict an enhancement of pure dephasing by 3 orders of magnitude. Employing the Floquet eigenstates as the computational basis, we show that high-fidelity single- and two-qubit gates can be implemented while maintaining dynamical sweet-spot operation. We further confirm that qubit readout can be performed by adiabatically mapping the Floquet states back to the static qubit states, and subsequently applying standard measurement techniques. Our work provides an intuitive tool to encode quantum information in robust, time-dependent states, and may be extended to alternative architectures for quantum-information processing.

AB There is mounting evidence that a second quantum revolution based on the technological capabilities to detect and manipulate single quantum particles (e.g., electrons, photons, ions, etc), a feat not achieved during the first quantum revolution, is progressing fast. It is expected that in less than 10 years, this second quantum revolution shall have a significant impact over numerous industries, including finance, medicine, energy, transportation, etc. Quantum computers threaten the status quo of cybersecurity, due to known quantum algorithms that can break asymmetric encryption, which is what gives us the ability to communicate securely using a public channel. Considering the world's dependence on digital communication through data exchange and processing, retaining the ability to communicate securely even once quantum computers come into play, cannot be stressed enough. Two solutions are available: Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) and Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC); which, we emphasise, are not mutually exclusive. The EuroQCI initiative, of which EQUO is a part of, focuses on QKD and aims to build a network whereby EU countries can communicate securely through QKD. To this aim, the DEP (Digital Europe Programme) project aims to bring technological matureness to QKD by deploying a QKD test network and, through this exercise, understand what is lacking from an operator's point of view when the time to integrate QKD in their network comes.

TI Can Randomly Structured Metasurfaces Be Used for Quantum Tomography of
   High-Dimensional Spatial Qudits?
SO ACS PHOTONICS
AB Reconstructing the density matrix of the quantum state of photons through a tomographically complete set of measurements, known as quantum state tomography, is an essential task in nearly all applications of quantum science and technology, from quantum sensing to quantum communications. Recent advances in optical metasurfaces enable the design of ultrathin nanostructured optical elements performing such state tomography tasks, promising greater simplicity, miniaturization, and scalability. However, reported metasurfaces on this goal were limited to a small Hilbert dimension, e.g., polarization qubits or spatial qudits with only a few states. When scaling up to higher-dimensional qudit tomography problems, especially those involving spatial qudits, a natural question arises: whether a metasurface with randomized nanostructures is sufficient to perform such qudit tomography, achieving optimal conditions. In this work, we attempt to answer this question through a set of numerical experiments with random metasurfaces, utilizing large-scale simulations of over 16,000 distinct metasurfaces, each exceeding 200 wavelengths in size. We show that, with sufficient redundancy in the number of detectors, random metasurfaces perform reasonably well in quantum photonic spatial qudit tomography encoded in Hermite-Gaussian states for up to approximately 10 states. Furthermore, we discuss additional considerations for optimizing metasurfaces in multiphoton cases. Our work opens a pathway toward computationally efficient, miniaturized, and error-tolerant quantum measurement platforms.

TI Fast transition-edge sensors suitable for photonic quantum computing
SO JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYSICS
AB Photon-number resolving transition-edge sensors (TESs) with near unity system detection efficiency enable novel approaches to quantum computing, for example, heralding robust Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill qubit states. Increasing the speed of the detectors increases the rate at which these states can be heralded. In addition, depending on the details of the scheme, faster detectors can reduce the complexities of the hardware implementation. In previous work, we demonstrated that adding a small amount of gold between the tungsten film and silicon substrate can increase thermal conductance and reduce detector recovery time. In that study, the readout electronics imposed limitations on stable biasing conditions of the TES detector, and the TES could only be biased at higher than ideal values. In this report, we demonstrate the operation of the TES illuminated by a heavily attenuated pulsed laser running at 1 MHz repetition rate and examine the limits to adding gold to speed up device recovery times using a higher bandwidth readout system. The best performance was achieved by combining a 15 x 15 mu m (2) tungsten TES with 5 mu m(3) of gold, which resulted in a recovery time faster than 250 ns, with an energy resolution of 0.25 eV full-width at half maximum at 0.8 eV photon energy.

TI On the quantum simulation of complex networks
SO SCIPOST PHYSICS CORE
AB Quantum walks provide a natural framework to approach graph problems with quantum computers, exhibiting speedups over their classical counterparts for tasks such as the search for marked nodes or the prediction of missing links. Continuous-time quantum walk algorithms assume that we can simulate the dynamics of quantum systems where the Hamiltonian is given by the adjacency matrix of the graph. It is known that such can be simulated efficiently if the underlying graph is row-sparse and efficiently row-computable. While this is sufficient for many applications, it limits the applicability for this class of algorithms to study real world complex networks, which, among other properties, are characterized by the existence of a few densely connected nodes, called hubs. In other words, complex networks are typically not row-sparse, even though the average connectivity over all nodes can be very small. In this work, we extend the state-of-the-art results on quantum simulation to graphs that contain a small number of hubs, but that are otherwise sparse. Hopefully, our results may lead to new applications of quantum computing to network science.

TI Measurement-device-independent quantum key distribution of multiple

SO FRONTIERS OF PHYSICS
AB Measurement-device-independent quantum key distribution (MDI-QKD) provides us a powerful approach to resist all attacks at detection side. Besides the unconditional security, people also seek for high key generation rate, but MDI-QKD has relatively low key generation rate. In this paper, we provide an efficient approach to increase the key generation rate of MDI-QKD by adopting multiple degrees of freedom (DOFs) of single photons to generate keys. Compared with other high-dimension MDI-QKD protocols encoding in one DOF, our protocol is more flexible, for our protocol generating keys in independent subsystems and the detection failure or error in a DOF not affecting the information encoding in other DOFs. Based on above features, our MDI-QKD protocol may have potential application in future quantum communication field.

SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ELECTRONICS AND TELECOMMUNICATIONS
AB this paper presents a generalization of a method allowing the transformation of the Elliptic Curve Discrete Logarithm Problem (ECDLP) over prime fields to the Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) problem. The original method requires that a given elliptic curve model has complete arithmetic. The new one has no such restriction, which is a breakthrough. Since the mentioned obstacle is no longer a problem, the latest version of the algorithm may be used for any elliptic curve model. As a result, one may use quantum annealing to solve ECDLP on any given model of elliptic curves.

TI Evaluating the noise resilience of variational quantum algorithms
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB We simulate the effects of different types of noise in state preparation circuits of variational quantum algorithms. We first use a variational quantum eigensolver to find the ground state of a Hamiltonian in the presence of noise and adopt two quality measures in addition to the energy, namely, fidelity and concurrence. We then extend the task to the one of constructing, with a layered quantum circuit ansatz, a set of general random target states. We determine the optimal circuit depth for different types and levels of noise, and observe that the variational algorithms mitigate the effects of noise by adapting the optimized parameters. We find that the inclusion of redundant parameterized gates makes the quantum circuits more resilient to noise. For such overparameterized circuits, different sets of parameters can result in the same final state in the noiseless case, which we denote as parameter degeneracy. Numerically, we show that this degeneracy can be lifted in the presence of noise, with some states being significantly more resilient to noise than others. We also show that the average deviation from the target state is linear in the noise level, as long as this is small compared to a circuit-dependent threshold. In this region, the deviation is well described by a stochastic model. Above the threshold, the optimization can converge to states with largely different physical properties from the true target state, so for practical applications it is critical to ensure that noise levels are below this threshold.

TI Optimised Trotter decompositions for classical and quantum computing
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICS A-MATHEMATICAL AND THEORETICAL
AB Suzuki-Trotter decompositions of exponential operators like exp(Ht) are required in almost every branch of numerical physics. Often the exponent under consideration has to be split into more than two operators H = Sigma(k) A(k), for instance as local gates on quantum computers. We demonstrate how highly optimised schemes originally derived for exactly two operators A(1,2) can be applied to such generic Suzuki-Trotter decompositions, providing a formal proof of correctness as well as numerical evidence of efficiency. A comprehensive review of existing symmetric decomposition schemes up to order n <= 4 is presented and complemented by a number of novel schemes, including both real and complex coefficients. We derive the theoretically most efficient unitary and non-unitary 4th order decompositions. The list is augmented by several exceptionally efficient schemes of higher order n <= 8. Furthermore we show how Taylor expansions can be used on classical devices to reach machine precision at a computational effort at which state of the art Trotterization schemes do not surpass a relative precision of 10(-4). Finally, a short and easily understandable summary explains how to choose the optimal decomposition in any given scenario.

TI Fast multi-qubit global-entangling gates without individual addressing
   of trapped ions
SO QUANTUM SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB We propose and study ways speeding up of the entangling operations in the trapped ions system with high fidelity. First, we find a scheme to increase the speed of a two-qubit gate without the limitation of trap frequency, which was considered as the fundamental limit. Second, we study the fast gate scheme for entangling more than two qubits simultaneously. We apply the method of applying multiple frequency components on laser beams for the gate operations. In particular, in order to avoid infinite terms from the coupling to carrier transition, we focus on the phase-insensitive gate scheme here. We carefully study the effect of large excitation of motional mode beyond the limit of Lamb-Dicke approximation by including up to second order terms of the Lamb-Dicke parameter. We study the speed limit of multi-qubit global entangling gates without individual addressing requirements. Furthermore, our gates can be made insensitive to the fluctuation of initial motional phases which are difficult to stabilise in the phase-insensitive gate scheme.

TI Entanglement types for two-qubit states with real amplitudes
SO QUANTUM INFORMATION PROCESSING
AB We study the set of two-qubit pure states with real amplitudes and their geometrical representation in the three-dimensional sphere. In this representation, we show that the maximally entangled states-those locally equivalent to the Bell states-form two disjoint circles perpendicular to each other. We also show that taking the natural Riemannian metric on the sphere, the set of states connected by local gates are equidistant to this pair of circles. Moreover, the unentangled or so-called product states are pi/4 units away to the maximally entangled states. This is, the unentangled states are the farthest away to the maximally entangled states. In this way, if we define two states to be equivalent if they are connected by local gates, we have that there are as many equivalent classes as points in the interval [0,pi/4] with the point 0 corresponding to the maximally entangled states. The point pi/4 corresponds to the unentangled states which geometrically are described by a torus. Finally, for every 0 < d < pi/4 the point d corresponds to a disjoint pair of torus. Finally, we also show how this geometrical interpretation allows to clearly see that any pair of two-qubit states with real amplitudes can be connected with a circuit that only has single-qubit gates and one controlled-Z gate.

TI Scalable Generation of Multiphoton Entangled States by Active
   Feed-Forward and Multiplexing
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB Multiphoton entangled quantum states are key to advancing quantum technologies such as multiparty quantum communications, quantum sensing, or quantum computation. Their scalable generation, however, remains an experimental challenge. Current methods for generating these states rely on stitching together photons from probabilistic sources, and state generation rates drop exponentially in the number of photons. Here, we implement a system based on active feed-forward and multiplexing that addresses this challenge. We demonstrate the scalable generation of four-photon and six-photon Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger states, increasing generation rates by factors of 9 and 35, respectively. This is consistent with the exponential enhancement compared to the standard nonmultiplexed approach that is predicted by our theory. These results facilitate the realization of practical multiphoton protocols for photonic quantum technologies.

SO APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL
AB We implement a set of simulation experiments in NetSquid specifically designed to estimate the end-to-end fidelity across a path of quantum repeaters or quantum switches. The switch model includes several generalizations that are not currently available in other tools and are useful for gaining insight into practical and realistic quantum network engineering problems: an arbitrary number of memory registers at the switches, simplicity in including entanglement distillation mechanisms, arbitrary switching topologies, and routing protocols. An illustrative case study is presented, namely a comparison in terms of performance between a repeater chain where repeaters can only swap sequentially and a single switch equipped with multiple memory registers that is able to handle multiple swapping requests.

TI Tailored Quantum Alternating Operator Ansatzes for Circuit Fault
   Diagnostics
SO ALGORITHMS
AB The quantum alternating operator ansatz (QAOA) and constrained quantum annealing (CQA) restrict the evolution of a quantum system to remain in a constrained space, often with a dimension much smaller than the whole Hilbert space. A natural question when using quantum annealing or a QAOA protocol to solve an optimization problem is to select an initial state for the wavefunction and what operators to use to evolve it into a solution state. In this work, we construct several ansatzes tailored to solve the combinational circuit fault diagnostic (CCFD) problem in different subspaces related to the structure of the problem, including superpolynomially smaller subspaces than the whole Hilbert space. We introduce a family of dense and highly connected circuits that include small instances but can be scaled to larger sizes as a useful collection of circuits for comparing different quantum algorithms. We compare the different ansatzes on instances randomly generated from this family under different parameter selection methods. The results support that ansatzes more closely tailored to exploiting the structure of the underlying optimization problems can have better performance than more generic ansatzes.

TI Quantum parallel information exchange (QPIE) hybrid network with
   transfer learning
SO QUANTUM SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB Quantum machine learning (QML) has emerged as an innovative framework that has the potential to uncover complex patterns by leveraging the ability of quantum systems to simulate and exploit high-dimensional latent spaces, particularly in learning tasks. Quantum neural network frameworks are inherently sensitive to the precision of gradient calculations and the computational limitations of current quantum hardware, as unitary rotations introduce overhead from complex number computations, and quantum gate operation speed remains a bottleneck for practical implementations. In this study, we introduce a quantum parallel information exchange hybrid network, a new non-sequential hybrid classical quantum model architecture that leverages quantum transfer learning by feeding pre-trained parameters from classical neural networks into quantum circuits. This enables efficient pattern recognition and temporal series data prediction by utilizing non-Clifford parameterized quantum gates, thereby enhancing both learning efficiency and representational capacity. Additionally, we developed a dynamic gradient selection method that applies the parameter-shift rule to quantum processing units (QPUs) and adjoint differentiation to graphics processing units (GPUs). Our results demonstrate that the model performance exhibits higher accuracy in ad-hoc benchmarks, lowering approximately 88% convergence rate for extra stochasticity time-series data within 100 -steps, and showing a more unbiased eigenvalue spectrum of the Fisher information matrix on the CPU/GPU and IonQ QPU simulators.

TI Chip-Based Electronic System for Quantum Key Distribution
SO ENTROPY
AB Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) has garnered significant attention due to its unconditional security based on the fundamental principles of quantum mechanics. While QKD has been demonstrated by various groups and commercial QKD products are available, the development of a fully chip-based QKD system, aimed at reducing costs, size, and power consumption, remains a significant technological challenge. Most researchers focus on the optical aspects, leaving the integration of the electronic components largely unexplored. In this paper, we present the design of a fully integrated electrical control chip for QKD applications. The chip, fabricated using 28 nm CMOS technology, comprises five main modules: an ARM processor for digital signal processing, delay cells for timing synchronization, ADC for sampling analog signals from monitors, OPAMP for signal amplification, and DAC for generating the required voltage for phase or intensity modulators. According to the simulations, the minimum delay is 11ps, the open-loop gain of the operational amplifier is 86.2 dB, the sampling rate of the ADC reaches 50 MHz, and the DAC achieves a high rate of 100 MHz. To the best of our knowledge, this marks the first design and evaluation of a fully integrated driver chip for QKD, holding the potential to significantly enhance QKD system performance. Thus, we believe our work could inspire future investigations toward the development of more efficient and reliable QKD systems.

TI Parallel entangling gate operations a d two-way quantum communication in
   spin chains
SO QUANTUM
AB The power of a quantum circuit is determined through the number of two-qubit entangling gates that can be performed within the coherence time of the system. In the absence of parallel quantum gate operations, this would make the quantum simulators limited to shallow circuits. Here, we propose a protocol to parallelize the implementation of two-qubit entangling gates between multiple users which are spatially separated and use a commonly shared spin chain data-bus. Our protocol works through inducing effective interaction between each pair of qubits without disturbing the others, therefore, it increases the rate of gate operations without creating crosstalk. This is achieved by tuning the Hamiltonian parameters appropriately, described in the form of two different strategies. The tuning of the parameters, makes different bilocalized eigenstates responsible for the realization of the entangling gates between different pairs of distant qubits. Remarkably, the performance of our protocol is robust against increasing the length of the data-bus and the number of users. Moreover, we show that this protocol can tolerate various types of disorders and is applicable in the context of superconductor-based systems. The proposed protocol can serve for realizing two-way quantum communication.

This is unique to EPR, wherein exchange-coupled electron spins are used. This is different from NMR (Nuclear Magnetic Resonance), which uses nuclear spins as qubits, that do not couple with each other by the exchange interaction.

TI Quantum neural network-based inverse kinematics of a six-jointed
   industrial robotic arm
SO ROBOTICS AND AUTONOMOUS SYSTEMS
AB This research examines the potential of quantum-inspired neural networks (QNNs) for solving the inverse nematics of robotic arms, focusing on the six-degree-of-freedom ABB IRB140 robot. Traditional inverse matics approaches face challenges such as non-unique solutions and computational complexity, especially increasing degrees of freedom. While artificial neural networks (ANNs) have shown promise, they require improvements, particularly in terms of quantum computing integration. This study introduces a quantum inspired activation function to multi-layer perceptron neural networks. We compared ANNs and QNNs and without singularity avoidance, finding that QNNs significantly outperformed ANNs in mean absolute (MAE), achieving a 15.60 % lower MAE in singularity-free models and a 16.67 % lower MAE in singularity avoidance models. The QNNs demonstrated superior precision, with a position error of 1.64 mm orientation error of 0.00179 radians when avoiding singularities. These results highlight the potential of QNNs enhance the precision, efficiency, and performance of robotic arm manipulation. Quantum computing advantages including parallelism, quantum entanglement, and quantum annealing, which contribute QNNs' superior performance. Overall, this study represents a practical contribution to robotics and quantum computing, paving the way for future research into applying quantum principles to neural network models robotics.

TI Interactive cryptographic proofs of quantumness using mid-circuit
   measurements
SO NATURE PHYSICS
AB The ability to perform measurements in the middle of a quantum circuit is a powerful resource. It underlies a wide range of applications, from remote state preparation to quantum error correction. Here we apply mid-circuit measurements for a particular task: demonstrating quantum computational advantage. The goal of such a demonstration is for a quantum device to perform a computational task that is infeasible for a classical device with comparable resources. In contrast to existing demonstrations, the distinguishing feature of our approach is that the classical verification process is efficient, both in asymptotic complexity and in practice. Furthermore, the classical hardness of performing the task is based upon well-established cryptographic assumptions. Protocols with these features are known as cryptographic proofs of quantumness. Using a trapped-ion quantum computer, we perform mid-circuit measurements by spatially isolating portions of the ion chain via shuttling. This enables us to implement two interactive cryptographic proofs of quantumness, which when suitably scaled to larger systems, promise the efficient verification of quantum computational advantage. Our methods can be applied to a range of interactive quantum protocols.
   Being able to perform qubit measurements within a quantum circuit and adapt to their outcome broadens the power of quantum computers. These mid-circuit measurements have now been used to implement a cryptographic proof of non-classical behaviour.

TI Inferring Quantum Network Topology Using Local Measurements
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB Statistical correlations that can be generated across the nodes in a quantum network depend crucially on its topology. However, this topological information might not be known a priori, or it may need to be verified. In this paper, we propose an efficient protocol for distinguishing and inferring the topology of a quantum network. We leverage entropic quantities-namely, the von Neumann entropy and the measured mutual information-as well as measurement covariance to uniquely characterize the topology. We show that the entropic quantities are sufficient to distinguish two networks that prepare GHZ states. Moreover, if qubit measurements are available, both entropic quantities and covariance can be used to infer the network topology without state-preparation assumptions. We show that the protocol can be entirely robust to noise and can be implemented via quantum variational optimization. Numerical experiments on both classical simulators and quantum hardware show that covariance is generally more reliable for accurately and efficiently inferring the topology, whereas entropy-based methods are often better at identifying the absence of entanglement in the low-shot regime.

TI Deterministic Hyperparallel Control Gates with Weak Kerr Effects
SO ADVANCED QUANTUM TECHNOLOGIES
AB By harnessing weak cross-Kerr nonlinearities, it proposes two deterministic hyperparallel quantum control gates, including the hyperparallel controlled-NOT (hyper-CNOT) gate and hyperparallel Fredkin (hyper-Fredkin) gate for photonic systems in the polarization and spatial degrees of freedom (DoFs), which are composed of two procedures for the implementations of the first polarized control (CNOT and Fredkin) gates and the second spatial control (CNOT and Fredkin) ones in turn. Moreover, compared with the two two-photon CNOT gates (three-photon Fredkin gates) in one DoF, the hyper-CNOT (hyper-Fredkin) gate is provided with more straightforward quantum circuits, lower computational costs of resource overhead (without the assistance of single photons or entangled states), less cross-Kerr nonlinear interactions between three photons and the coherent states, and reduces the effect caused by photon-loss noise. The success probabilities of two quantum control gates are approximated unit by performing the corresponding classical feed-forward operations based on the different measuring outcomes of the X-homodyne detectors to be aimed at the coherent states, and they are robust against the photon loss as well, which are feasible with the current technology and convenient in practical applications.

TI Integrating biophysical modeling, quantum computing, and AI to discover
   plastic-binding peptides that combat microplastic pollution
SO PNAS NEXUS
AB Methods are needed to mitigate microplastic (MP) pollution to minimize their harm to the environment and human health. Given the ability of polypeptides to adsorb strongly to materials of micro- or nanometer size, plastic-binding peptides (PBPs) could help create bio-based tools for detecting, filtering, or degrading MNP pollution. However, the development of such tools is prevented by the lack of PBPs. In this work, we discover and evaluate PBPs for several common plastics by combining biophysical modeling, molecular dynamics (MD), quantum computing, and reinforcement learning. We frame peptide affinity for a given plastic through a Potts model that is a function of the amino acid sequence and then search for the amino acid sequences with the greatest predicted affinity using quantum annealing. We also use proximal policy optimization to find PBPs with a broader range of physicochemical properties, such as isoelectric point or solubility. Evaluation of the discovered PBPs in MD simulations demonstrates that the peptides have high affinity for two of the plastics: polyethylene and polypropylene. We conclude by describing how our computational approach could be paired with experimental approaches to create a nexus for designing and optimizing peptide-based tools that aid the detection, capture, or biodegradation of MPs. We thus hope that this study will aid in the fight against MP pollution.

Keeping this in mind, we focus on the evaluation of the amount of information we obtain when we know the system belongs to the model within the parameter range. Excluding classical fluctuations, uncertainty still remains in the system. We propose an information quantity called purely quantum information to evaluate this and give it an operational meaning. For the qubit case, it is relevant to the facility location problem on the unit sphere, which is well known in operations research. For general cases, we extend this to the facility location problem in complex projective spaces. Purely quantum information reflects the uncertainty of a quantum system and is related to the minimum entropy rather than the von Neumann entropy.

TI Efficient estimation and sequential optimization of cost functions in
   variational quantum algorithms
SO QUANTUM SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB Classical optimization is a cornerstone of the success of variational quantum algorithms, which often require determining the derivatives of the cost function relative to variational parameters. The computation of the cost function and its derivatives, coupled with their effective utilization, facilitates faster convergence by enabling smooth navigation through complex landscapes, ensuring the algorithm's success in addressing challenging variational problems. In this work, we introduce a novel problem-tailored optimization methodology that conceptualizes the parameterized quantum circuit as a weighted sum of distinct unitary operators, enabling the cost function to be expressed as a sum of multiple terms. This representation facilitates the efficient evaluation of nonlocal characteristics of cost functions, as well as their arbitrary derivatives. The optimization protocol then utilizes the nonlocal information on the cost function to facilitate a more efficient navigation process, ultimately enhancing the performance in the pursuit of optimal solutions. We utilize this methodology for two distinct cost functions. The first is the squared residual of the variational state relative to a target state, which is subsequently employed to examine the nonlinear dynamics of fluid configurations governed by the one-dimensional Burgers' equation. The second cost function is the expectation value of an observable, which is later utilized to approximate the ground state of the nonlinear Schr & ouml;dinger equation. Our findings reveal substantial enhancements in convergence speed and accuracy relative to traditional optimization methods, even within complex, high-dimensional landscapes. Our work contributes to the advancement of optimization strategies for variational quantum algorithms, establishing a robust framework for addressing a range of computationally intensive problems across numerous applications.

TI Robust evaluation of classical and quantum machine learning under noise,
   imbalance, feature reduction and explainability
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB Quantum machine learning (QML) has emerged as a promising paradigm for solving complex classification problems by leveraging the computational advantages of quantum systems. While most traditional machine learning models focus on clean, balanced datasets, real-world data is often noisy, imbalanced and high-dimensional, posing significant challenges for scalability and generalisation. This paper conducts an extensive experimental evaluation of five supervised classifiers- Decision Tree, K nearest neighbour, Random Forest, linear regression and support vector machines in comparison with Quantum machine learning classifiers- quantum Support vector machine, quantum k- nearest neighbor and variational quantum classifier-across five diverse datasets, including iris, wine quality, Breast cancer, UCI human activity recognition, and Pima diabetes. To simulate real-world challenges, we introduce class imbalance using SMOTE and ADASYN Sampling, inject Gaussian noise into the features, and assess the impact of dimensionality reduction through ANOVA-based feature selection. Additionally, we utilise explainable AI tools, such as SHAP and LIME, to interpret model decisions. Our results demonstrate that Logistic Regression consistently performs well under various complexities, while Quantum Support Vector Machines show resilience to feature noise and class imbalance. The study also highlights the current capabilities and limitations of QML models, offering valuable insights into building generalisable and interpretable ML systems for deployment in complex environments. These insights are crucial for building robust, interpretable, and generalisable ML models for practical deployment.

TI From Pulses to Circuits and Back Again: A Quantum Optimal Control
   Perspective on Variational Quantum Algorithms
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB The last decade has witnessed remarkable progress in the development of quantum technologies. Although fault-tolerant devices likely remain years away, the noisy intermediate-scale quantum devices of today may be leveraged for other purposes. Leading candidates are variational quantum algorithms (VQAs), which have been developed for applications including chemistry, optimization, and machine learning, but whose implementations on quantum devices have yet to demonstrate improvements over classical capabilities. In this Perspective, we propose a variety of ways that the performance of VQAs could be informed by quantum optimal control theory. A major theme throughout is the need for sufficient control resources in VQA implementations; we discuss different ways this need can manifest, outline a variety of open questions, and look to the future.

TI DFT Analysis of Hole Qubits Spin State in Germanium Thin Layer

AB Due to the presence of a strong spin-orbit interaction, hole qubits in germanium are increasingly being considered as candidates for quantum computing. These objects make it possible to create electrically controlled logic gates with the basic properties of scalability, a reasonable quantum error correction, and the necessary speed of operation. In this paper, using the methods of quantum-mechanical calculations and considering the non-collinear magnetic interactions, the quantum states of the system 2D structure of Ge in the presence of even and odd numbers of holes were investigated. The spatial localizations of hole states were calculated, favorable quantum states were revealed, and the magnetic structural characteristics of the system were analyzed.

TI On Nonuniqueness of Quantum Channel for Fixed Input-Output States: Case
   of Decoherence Channel
SO SYMMETRY-BASEL
AB For a fixed pair of input and output states in the space HA of a system A, a quantum channel, i.e., a linear, completely positive and trace-preserving map, between them is not unique, in general. Here, this point is discussed specifically for a decoherence channel, which maps from a pure input state to a completely decoherent state like the thermal state. In particular, decoherence channels of two different types are analyzed: one is unital and the other is not, and both of them can be constructed through reduction of B in the total extended space HA & OTIMES;HB, where HB is the space of an ancillary system B that is a replica of A. The nonuniqueness is seen to have its origin in the unitary symmetry in the extended space. It is shown in an example of a two-qubit system how such symmetry is broken in the objective subspace HA due to entanglement between A and B. A comment is made on possible relevance of the present work to nanothermodynamics in view of quantum Darwinism.

TI Measurement-device-independenization of quantum key distribution
   protocols
SO CHINESE JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB Quantum key distribution (QKD) allows the legitimate partner to establish a secret key whose security only depends on physical laws. In recent years, research on QKD by employing insecure measurement devices, namely measurement-device-independent QKD (MDI-QKD) is increased. MDI-QKD removes all attacks on measurement devices and thus an untrusted third party can be employed for measuring. However, a weakness of previous MDI-QKD protocols is the need for joint measurements such as Bell measurements whose efficiency is low in practice. On the other hand, can all QKD protocols become measurement-device-independent remains a problem. In this paper, we present a scheme making prepare-measure QKD protocols become MDI-QKD protocols, called & PRIME;measurement-device-independenization & PRIME;, which does not need to employ joint measurements and could be efficiently implemented by weak coherence sources. The protocol might look like the detector-device-independent (DDI) protocols but it is also secure under the Trojan horse attack. To illustrate this, we investigate the photon-number-adding (PNA) attack and present a scheme, called & PRIME;photon - number - puri f ication & PRIME;, which can also be employed to close loopholes for previous protocols such as DDI and plug-and-play ones.

TI Toward Mixed Analog-Digital Quantum Signal Processing: Quantum AD/DA
   Conversion and the Fourier Transform
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON SIGNAL PROCESSING
AB Signal processing stands as a pillar of classical computation and modern information technology, applicable to both analog and digital signals. Recently, advancements in quantum information science have suggested that quantum signal processing (QSP) can enable more powerful signal processing capabilities. However, the developments in QSP have primarily leveraged digital quantum resources, such as discrete-variable (DV) systems like qubits, rather than analog quantum resources, such as continuous-variable (CV) systems like quantum oscillators. Consequently, there remains a gap in understanding how signal processing can be performed on hybrid CV-DV quantum computers. Here we address this gap by developing a new paradigm of mixed analog-digital QSP. We demonstrate the utility of this paradigm by showcasing how it naturally enables analog-digital conversion of quantum signals-specifically, the transfer of states between DV and CV quantum systems. We then show that such quantum analog-digital conversion enables new implementations of quantum algorithms on CV-DV hardware. This is exemplified by realizing the quantum Fourier transform of a state encoded on qubits via the free-evolution of a quantum oscillator, albeit with a runtime exponential in the number of qubits due to information theoretic arguments. Collectively, this work marks a significant step forward in hybrid CV-DV quantum computation, providing a foundation for scalable analog-digital signal processing on quantum processors.

SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON APPLIED SUPERCONDUCTIVITY
AB Development of practical quantum computers would require 1000's of qubits and equally large number of read-out, bias and drive lines. New materials that combine low passive loss and good RF properties are needed. Here we report performance of signal interconnects comprised of high-temperature YBCO films that are exfoliated from a metal substrate and transferred to a E-Kapton tape. The technology offers low-loss transition between 60 K to sub-mK environments and interfacing with off-shelf flexible silicon electronics. We demonstrate <1 dB/m attenuation at 6 GHz at 77 K. The microstrip assemblies demonstrated no degradation upon multiple cycling to liquid Nitrogen and conduction cooling down to 18 K. We discuss the design of a practical high-density signal cable with passive loss well below 1 mu W per line. The YBCO-on-Kapton technology offers a practical pathway to large error-corrected quantum computing systems.

In this work, we successfully execute two variational quantum algorithms on a silicon photonic integrated circuit at room temperature: a variational quantum eigensolver for the Hydrogen molecule and a variational quantum factorization for semiprime numbers. In our reconfigurable silicon photonic circuit, four identical spontaneous-four-wave-mixing-based integrated photon pair sources are used to prepare two path-entangled ququarts, whose correlation gives rise to the resource for generic trial states' preparation. This marks a first demonstration of variational quantum algorithms on a photonic quantum simulator with integrated photon pair sources.

AB Since we are entering the Post-Moore Law era and consequently the limit of Von Neumann's architecture, the scientific community is looking for alternatives to satisfy the growing computing power demands of scientific applications.
   Quantum computing promises to achieve a computational advantage over the classic Von Neumann architecture. However, the limited capabilities of current noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices require quantum computers to interoperate with classic systems, forming the so-called hybrid quantum systems. Research on hybrid quantum systems led to the design of Variational Quantum Algorithms, currently the most promising way to move towards quantum advantage.
   However, execution time and accuracy of variational quantum algorithms are affected by different hyperparameters, including selected cost functions and parametrized quantum circuits. Consequently, providing developers with methods to select the right set of parameters is of paramount importance.
   In this work, we provide a formal method for the selection of hyperparameters in variational quantum algorithms, which will support quantum algorithms developers in the design of quantum applications, and evaluate it on a real-world scientific application, showing a reduction of error up to 31%.

TI Learning-agent-based approach to the characterization of open quantum
   systems
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW APPLIED
AB Characterizing quantum processes is crucial for the execution of quantum algorithms on available quantum devices. A powerful framework for this purpose is the Quantum Model Learning Agent (QMLA), which characterizes a given system by learning its Hamiltonian via adaptive generations of informative experiments and their validation against simulated models. Identifying the incoherent noise of a quantum device in addition to its coherent interactions is, however, as essential. Precise knowledge of such imperfections of a quantum device allows one to devise strategies to mitigate detrimental effects, for example, via quantum error correction. We introduce the open Quantum Model Learning Agent (oQMLA) framework to account for Markovian noise through the Liouvillian formalism. By simultaneously learning the Hamiltonian and jump operators, oQMLA independently captures both the coherent and incoherent dynamics of a system. The added complexity of open systems necessitates advanced algorithmic strategies. Among these, we implement regularization to steer the algorithm toward plausible models and an unbiased metric to evaluate the quality of the results. We validate our implementation in simulated scenarios of increasing complexity, demonstrating its robustness to hardware-induced measurement errors and its ability to characterize systems using only local operations. Additionally, we develop a scheme to interface oQMLA with a publicly available superconducting quantum computer, showcasing its practical utility. These advancements represent a significant step toward improving the performance of quantum hardware and contribute to the broader goal of advancing quantum technologies and their applications.

TI Fermion-parity qubit in a proximitized double quantum dot
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Bound states in quantum dots coupled to superconductors can be in a coherent superposition of states with different electron number but with the same fermion parity. Electrostatic gating can tune this superposition to a sweet spot, where the quantum dot has the same mean electric charge independent of its electron-number parity. Here, we propose to encode quantum information in the local fermion parity of two tunnel-coupled quantum dots embedded in a Josephson junction. At the sweet spot, the qubit states have zero charge dipole moment. This protects the qubit from dephasing due to charge noise acting on the potential of each dot, as well as fluctuations of the (weak) interdot tunneling. At weak interdot tunneling, relaxation is suppressed because of disjoint qubit states. However, for strong interdot tunneling the system is protected against noise affecting each quantum dot separately (energy-level noise, dot-superconductor tunneling fluctuations, and hyperfine interactions). Finally, we describe initialization and readout as well as single-qubit and two-qubit gates by pulsing gate voltages.

TI Noisy intermediate-scale quantum algorithms
SO REVIEWS OF MODERN PHYSICS
AB A universal fault-tolerant quantum computer that can efficiently solve problems such as integer factorization and unstructured database search requires millions of qubits with low error rates and long coherence times. While the experimental advancement toward realizing such devices will potentially take decades of research, noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) computers already exist. These computers are composed of hundreds of noisy qubits, i.e., qubits that are not error corrected, and therefore perform imperfect operations within a limited coherence time. In the search for achieving quantum advantage with these devices, algorithms have been proposed for applications in various disciplines spanning physics, machine learning, quantum chemistry, and combinatorial optimization. The overarching goal of such algorithms is to leverage the limited available resources to perform classically challenging tasks. In this review, a thorough summary of NISQ computational paradigms and algorithms is provided. The key structure of these algorithms and their limitations and advantages are discussed. A comprehensive overview of various benchmarking and software tools useful for programming and testing NISQ devices is additionally provided.

TI Using Cryogenic CMOS Control Electronics to Enable a Two-Qubit
   Cross-Resonance Gate
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB Qubit control electronics composed of CMOS circuits are of critical interest for next-generation quantum computing systems. A CMOS-based application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) fabricated in 14-nm fin field-effect transistor (FinFET) technology was used to generate and sequence qubit control wave forms and demonstrate a two-qubit cross-resonance gate between fixed-frequency transmons. The controller was thermally anchored to the T = 4 K stage of a dilution refrigerator and the measured power was 23 mW per qubit under active control. The chip generated single-side banded output frequencies between 4.5 and 5.5 GHz, with a maximum power output of -18 dBm. Randomized-benchmarking (RB) experiments revealed an average number of 1.71 instructions per Clifford (IPC) for single-qubit gates and 17.51 IPC for two-qubit gates. A single-qubit error per gate of E1Q = 8 x 10-4 and a two-qubit error per gate of E2Q = 1.4 x 10-2 were shown. A drive-induced Z rotation was observed by way of a rotary-echo experiment; this observation is consistent with the expected qubit behavior given the measured excess local-oscillator (LO) leakage from the CMOS chip. The effect of spurious drive-induced Z errors was numerically evaluated with a two-qubit model Hamiltonian and shown to be in good agreement with the measured RB data. The modeling results suggest that the Z error varies linearly with the pulse amplitude.

TI Superfluid-Cooled Transmon Qubits under Optical Excitation
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB Microwave-to-optical quantum state transfer enables the interconnection of remote superconducting quantum processors via optical-fiber links. Achieving high conversion efficiency necessitates an intense optical pump, yet direct optical exposure of superconducting circuits often degrades their performance. Efficient and fast thermalization of superconducting qubits is therefore essential. To achieve this, we immerse a laser-illuminated transmon qubit in superfluid helium-4 and investigate its behavior. We observe that the qubit recovers significantly faster in superfluid helium than in vacuum, with an improvement in power handling by over 10 dB. This enhanced cooling capacity supports higher optical pump powers, shortening recovery times after high-power optical pulses. These findings open a promising pathway for future efficient implementation of microwave-to-optical quantum transduction devices.

TI Quantum correlations and ergotropy
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW E
AB Understanding the role of classical and quantum correlations in work extraction is a problem of fundamental importance in thermodynamics. We approach this problem by considering that, in closed quantum systems, the maximum cyclic work extractable is equal to the ergotropy. Thus, we aim to identify and investigate the contributions to the ergotropy coming from different kinds of initial correlations (total, classical, discord, and entanglement correlations). By doing so, we have introduced and studied quantifiers of correlations which are based on ergotropy. In particular, our results suggest that only discord correlations always give a positive contribution to work extraction, whereas total, classical, and entanglement correlations can reduce the work extraction.

TI Toward the real-time evolution of gauge-invariant Z2 and U(1) quantum
   link models on noisy intermediate-scale quantum hardware with error
   mitigation
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW D
AB Practical quantum computing holds clear promise in addressing problems not generally tractable with classical simulation techniques, and some key physically interesting applications are those of real-time dynamics in strongly coupled lattice gauge theories. In this article, we benchmark the real-time dynamics of Z2 and U(1) gauge-invariant plaquette models using noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) hardware, specifically the superconducting-qubit-based quantum IBM Q computers. We design quantum circuits for models of increasing complexity and measure physical observables such as the return probability to the initial state and locally conserved charges. NISQ hardware suffers from significant decoherence and a corresponding difficulty to interpret the results. We demonstrate the use of hardware-agnostic error mitigation techniques, such as circuit folding methods implemented via the Mitiq package, and we show what they can achieve within the quantum volume restrictions for the hardware. Our study provides insight into the choice of Hamiltonians, the construction of circuits, and the utility of error mitigation methods to devise large-scale quantum computation strategies for lattice gauge theories.

TI Mapping indefinite causal order processes to composable quantum
   protocols in a spacetime
SO NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB Formalisms for higher order quantum processes provide a theoretical formalisation of quantum processes where the order of agents' operations need not be definite and acyclic, but may be subject to quantum superpositions. This has led to the concept of indefinite causal structures (ICS) which have garnered much interest. However, the interface between these information-theoretic approaches and spatiotemporal notions of causality is less understood, and questions relating to the physical realisability of ICS in a spatiotemporal context persist despite progress in their information-theoretic characterisation. Further, previous work suggests that composition of processes is not so straightforward in ICS frameworks, which raises the question of how this connects with the observed composability of physical experiments in spacetime. To address these points, we compare the formalism of quantum circuits with quantum control of causal order (QC-QC), which models an interesting class of ICS processes, with that of causal boxes, which models composable quantum information protocols in spacetime. We incorporate the set-up assumptions of the QC-QC framework into the spatiotemporal perspective and show that every QC-QC can be mapped to a causal box that satisfies these set up assumptions and acts on a Fock space while reproducing the QC-QC's behaviour in a relevant subspace defined by the assumptions. Using a recently introduced concept of fine-graining, we show that the causal box corresponds to a fine-graining of the QC-QC, which unravels the original ICS of the QC-QC into a set of quantum operations with a well-defined and acyclic causal order, compatible with the spacetime structure. Our results also clarify how the composability of physical experiments is recovered, while highlighting the essential role of relativistic causality and the Fock space structure.

TI Folding lattice proteins with quantum annealing
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Quantum annealing is a promising approach for obtaining good approximate solutions to difficult optimization problems. Folding a protein sequence into its minimum-energy structure represents such a problem. For testing new algorithms and technologies for this task, the minimal lattice-based [hydrophobic (H) or polar (P) beads] HP model is well suited, as it represents a considerable challenge despite its simplicity. The HP model has favorable interactions between adjacent, not directly bound hydrophobic residues. Here, we develop a novel spin representation for lattice protein folding tailored for quantum annealing. With a distributed encoding onto the lattice, it differs from earlier attempts to fold lattice proteins on quantum annealers, which were based upon chain growth techniques. With our encoding, the Hamiltonian by design has the quadratic structure required for calculations on an Ising-type annealer, without having to introduce any auxiliary spin variables. This property greatly facilitates the study of long chains. The approach is robust to changes in the parameters required to constrain the spin system to chainlike configurations, and performs very well in terms of solution quality. The results are evaluated against existing exact results for HP chains with up to N = 30 beads with 100% hit rate, thereby also outperforming classical simulated annealing. In addition, the method allows us to recover the lowest known energies for N = 48 and N = 64 HP chains, with similar hit rates. These results are obtained by the commonly used hybrid quantum-classical approach. For pure quantum annealing, our method successfully folds an N = 14 HP chain. The calculations were performed on a D-Wave Advantage quantum annealer.

TI Native Two-Qubit Gates in Fixed-Coupling, Fixed-Frequency Transmons
   Beyond Cross-Resonance Interaction
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB Fixed -frequency superconducting qubits demonstrate remarkable success as platforms for stable and scalable quantum computing. Cross-resonance gates have been the workhorse of fixed-coupling, fixedfrequency superconducting processors, leveraging the entanglement generated by driving one qubit resonantly with a neighbor's frequency to achieve high -fidelity, universal controlled- NOT ( CNOT ) gates. Here, we use on -resonant and off -resonant microwave drives to go beyond cross-resonance, realizing natively interesting two-qubit gates t hat are not equivalent to CNOT gates. In particular, we implement and benchmark native i SWAP , SWAP , root i SWAP , and b SWAP gates; in fact, any SU (4 ) unitary can be achieved using these techniques. Furthermore, we apply these techniques for an efficient construction of the B gate: a perfect entangler from which any two-qubit gate can be reached in only two applications. We show that these native two-qubit gates are better than their counterparts compiled from cross-resonance gates. We elucidate the resonance conditions required to drive each two-qubit gate and provide a novel frame tracking technique to implement them in Qiskit.

AB In this work we explore the fabrication and experimental characterization of multi-gate FD-SOI devices that can operate both as single electron transistors (SETs) and MOSFETs. FD-SOI SET operation is achieved with electrostatically induced tunneling barriers controllable by two barrier gates (B-L and B-R) and a front gate (FG), the device operation being additionally tunable by a bottom gate (BG). Coulomb blockade current measurements at 10 mK and 4 K demonstrate the possibility of a dynamic transition from a FD-SOI MOSFET and SET operation, making this technology suitable for hybrid SET-MOSFET low power cryogenic circuits for quantum information processing. Room temperature back-gate characterization has been performed on ultra-thin film devices proving the effective reduction of charge noise for a specific bias configuration. This experimental work is a step forward towards low noise planar FD-SOI quantum dots based devices with tunable electrostatic control.

TI Cavity-magnon polaritons strongly coupled to phonons
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Building hybrid quantum systems is a crucial step for realizing multifunctional quantum technologies, quantum information processing, and hybrid quantum networks. A functional hybrid quantum system requires strong coupling among its components, however, couplings between distinct physical systems are typically very weak. Here we demonstrate the realization of triple strong coupling in a polaromechanical hybrid system where polaritons, formed by strongly coupled ferromagnetic magnons and microwave photons, are further strongly coupled to phonons. We observe the corresponding polaromechanical normal-mode splitting. By significantly reducing the polariton decay rate via realizing coherent perfect absorption, we achieve a high polaromechanical cooperativity of 9.4 x 103. A quantum cooperativity much greater than unity is achievable at cryogenic temperatures, which would enable various quantum applications. Our results pave the way towards coherent quantum control of photons, magnons and phonons, and are a crucial step for building functional hybrid quantum systems based on magnons.

TI Self-consistent noise characterization of quantum devices
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
AB Characterizing and understanding the environment affecting quantum systems is critical to elucidate its physical properties and engineer better quantum devices. We develop an approach to reduce the quantum environment causing single-qubit dephasing to a simple yet predictive noise model. Our approach, inspired by quantum noise spectroscopy, is to define a "self-consistent" classical noise spectrum, that is, compatible with all observed decoherence under various qubit dynamics. We demonstrate the power and limits of our approach by characterizing, with nanoscale spatial resolution, the noise experienced by two electronic spins in diamond that, despite their proximity, surprisingly reveal the presence of a complex quantum spin environment, both classically reducible and not. Our results overcome the limitations of existing noise spectroscopy methods and highlight the importance of finding predictive models to accurately characterize the underlying environment. Extending our work to multiqubit systems would enable spatially resolved quantum sensing of complex environments and quantum device characterization, notably to identify correlated noise between qubits, which is crucial for practical realization of quantum error correction.

TI Stabilizing and Improving Qubit Coherence by Engineering the Noise
   Spectrum of Two-Level Systems
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW APPLIED
AB Superconducting circuits are a leading platform for quantum computing. However, their coherence times are still limited and exhibit temporal fluctuations. Those phenomena are often attributed to the coupling between qubits and material defects that can be well described as an ensemble of two-level systems (TLSs). Among them, charge fluctuators inside amorphous oxide layers contribute to both low-frequency 1/f charge noise and high-frequency dielectric loss, causing fast qubit dephasing and relaxation. Moreover, spectral diffusion from mutual TLS interactions varies the noise amplitude over time, fluctuating the qubit lifetime. Here, we propose to mitigate those harmful effects by engineering the relevant TLS noise spectral densities. Specifically, our protocols smooth the high-frequency noise spectrum and suppress the low-frequency noise amplitude via depolarizing and dephasing the TLSs, respectively. As a result, we predict a drastic stabilization in qubit lifetime and an increase in qubit pure dephasing time. Our detailed analysis of feasible experimental implementations shows that the improvement is not compromised by spurious coupling from the applied noise to the qubit.

TI Distributed Partial Quantum Consensus of Qubit Networks With Connected
   Topologies
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON CYBERNETICS
AB In this article, we consider the partial quantum consensus problem of a qubit network in a distributed view. The local quantum operation is designed based on the Hamiltonian by using the local information of each quantum system in a network of qubits. We construct the unitary transformation for each quantum system to achieve the partial quantum consensus, that is, the directions of the quantum states in the Bloch ball will reach an agreement. A simple case of two-qubit quantum systems is considered first, and a minimum completing time of reaching partial consensus is obtained based on the geometric configuration of each qubit. Furthermore, we extend the approaches to deal with the more general N -qubit networks. Two partial quantum consensus protocols, based on the Lyapunov method for chain graphs and the geometry method for connected graphs, are proposed. The geometry method can be utilized to deal with more general connected graphs, while for the Lyapunov method, the global consensus can be obtained. The numerical simulation over a qubit network is demonstrated to verify the validity and the effectiveness of the theoretical results.

TI On Explaining Quantum Correlations: Causal vs. Non-Causal
SO ENTROPY
AB At the basis of the problem of explaining non-local quantum correlations lies the tension between two factors: on the one hand, the natural interpretation of correlations as the manifestation of a causal relation; on the other, the resistance on the part of the physics underlying said correlations to adjust to the most essential features of a pre-theoretic notion of causation. In this paper, I argue for the rejection of the first horn of the dilemma, i.e., the assumption that quantum correlations call for a causal explanation. The paper is divided into two parts. The first, destructive, part provides a critical overview of the enterprise of causally interpreting non-local quantum correlations, with the aim of warning against the temptation of an account of causation claiming to cover such correlations 'for free'. The second, constructive, part introduces the so-called structural explanation (a variety of non-causal explanation that shows how the explanandum is the manifestation of a fundamental structure of the world) and argues that quantum correlations might be explained structurally in the context of an information-theoretic approach to QT.

TI Coherences of Photoinduced Electron Spin Qubit Pair States in
   Photosystem I
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY B
AB This publication presents the first comprehensive experimental study of electron spin coherences in photosynthetic reaction center proteins, specifically focusing on photosystem I (PSI). The ultrafast electron transfer in PSI generates spin-correlated radical pairs (SCRPs), which are entangled spin pairs formed in well-defined spin states (Bell states). Since their discovery in our group in the 1980s, SCRPs have been extensively used to enhance our understanding of structure-function relationships in photosynthetic proteins. More recently, SCRPs have been utilized as tools for quantum sensing. Electron spin decoherence poses a significant challenge in realizing practical applications of electron spin qubits, particularly the creation of quantum entanglement between multiple electron spins. This work is focused on the systematic characterization of decoherence in SCRPs of PSI. These decoherence times were measured as electron spin echo decay times, termed phase memory times (T-M), at various temperatures. Decoherence was recorded on both transient SCRP states P(700)(+)A(1)(-) and thermalized states. Our study reveals that T-M exhibits minimal dependence on the biological species, biochemical treatment, and paramagnetic species. The analysis indicates that nuclear spin diffusion and instantaneous diffusion mechanisms alone cannot explain the observed decoherence. As a plausible explanation we discuss the assumption that the low-temperature dynamics of methyl groups in the protein surrounding the unpaired electron spin centers is the main factor governing the loss of the spin coherence in PSI.

TI Preparing Magnon-Photon Pairs in a Cavity-Magnon-Qubit System
SO ADVANCED PHOTONICS RESEARCH
AB Hybrid quantum states consisting of single photons and single magnons are valuable quantum resources for realizing multiple quantum information tasks. The blockade effects of magnons and photons in a cavity-magnon-qubit system are investigated, where an auxiliary microwave cavity is simultaneously coupled with an yttrium iron garnet sphere, a qubit, and another microwave cavity. The modes of the auxiliary cavity are adiabatically eliminated, and the virtual photons in the auxiliary cavity mediate the coupling between the magnon mode and photon mode. When the system parameters satisfy both conventional and unconventional blockade conditions, both the magnon/photon auto-correlation and magnon-photon cross-correlation are weak, indicating that magnons and photons tend to exist alone in the system. When the system parameters only satisfy unconventional blockade conditions, strong magnon-photon cross-correlation can be exhibited, indicating that magnons and photons tend to exist simultaneously in the system. The proposal presents a method for preparing magnon-photon pairs, which may have potential applications in quantum information sciences and technologies.

TI Heralded high-fidelity quantum hyper-CNOT gates assisted by charged
   quantum dots inside single-sided optical microcavities
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB Photonic hyper-parallel quantum information processing (QIP) can simplify the quantum circuit and improve the information-processing speed, as well as reduce the quantum resource consumption and suppress the photonic dissipation noise. Here, utilizing the singly charged semiconductor quantum dot (QD) inside single-sided optical microcavity as the potentially experimental platform, we propose five schemes for heralded four-qubit hyper-controlled-not (hyper-CNOT) gates, covering all cases of four-qubit hyper-CNOT gates operated on both the polarization and spatial-mode degrees of freedom (DoFs) of a two-photon system. The novel heralding mechanism improves the fidelity of each hyper-CNOT gate to unity in principle without the strict restriction of strong coupling. The adaptability and scalability of the schemes make the hyper-CNOT gates more accessible under current experimental technologies. These heralded high-fidelity photonic hyper-CNOT gates can therefore have immense utilization potentials in high-capacity quantum communication and fast quantum computing, which are of far-reaching significance for QIP.

TI A quantum algorithm for finding collision-inducing disturbance vectors
   in SHA-1
SO PHYSICA SCRIPTA
AB Modern cryptographic protocols rely on sophisticated hash functions to generate quasi-unique numbers that serve as signatures for user authentication and other security verifications. The security could be compromised by finding texts hash-mappable to identical numbers, forming so-called collision attack. Seeding a disturbance vector in the hash mapping to obtain a successful collision is that a major focus of cryptography study in the past two decades to improve hash protocols. We propose an algorithm that takes advantage of entangled quantum states for concurrent seeding of candidate disturbance vectors, out of which the one entailing collision is selected through a combination of quantum search, phase gating, diffusion gating, and information feedbacks from classical computing machinery. The complexity reduction is shown to be on the order of O(2(n/2+1)) where n is the number of qubits encoding addresses. We demonstrate the practicality of the proposed by an implementation scheme based on degenerate optical parametric oscillators.

TI Frequency-bin entanglement-based Quantum Key Distribution
SO NPJ QUANTUM INFORMATION
AB Entanglement is an essential ingredient in many quantum communication protocols. In particular, entanglement can be exploited in quantum key distribution (QKD) to generate two correlated random bit strings whose randomness is guaranteed by the nonlocal property of quantum mechanics. Most of QKD protocols tested to date rely on polarization and/or time-bin encoding. Despite compatibility with existing fiber-optic infrastructure and ease of manipulation with standard components, frequency-bin QKD have not yet been fully explored. Here we report a demonstration of entanglement-based QKD using frequency-bin encoding. We implement the BBM92 protocol using photon pairs generated by two independent, high-finesse, ring resonators on a silicon photonic chip. We perform a passive basis selection scheme and simultaneously record sixteen projective measurements. A key finding is that frequency-bin encoding is sensitive to the random phase noise induced by thermal fluctuations of the environment. To correct for this effect, we developed a real-time adaptive phase rotation of the measurement basis, achieving stable transmission over a 26 km fiber spool with a secure key rate >= 4.5 bit/s. Our work introduces a new degree of freedom for the realization of entangled based QKD protocols in telecom networks.

TI Efficient Algorithm for Binary Quadratic Problem by Column Generation

SO JOURNAL OF THE PHYSICAL SOCIETY OF JAPAN
AB We propose an efficient algorithm that combines column generation and quantum annealing to solve binary quadratic problems. Binary quadratic problems are difficult to solve because they are NP-hard. An attempt to solve binary quadratic problems efficiently by column generation has been studied, but it demands successively solving quadratic unconstrained binary optimization problems. We solve the bottleneck by using quantum annealing or simulated annealing. Our results demonstrate a good approximate solution obtained in 2.7 to 1000 times shorter computational time to use column generation and quantum annealing to solve binary quadratic problems than the existing fast solver.

AB Quantum nonlocal correlations are generated by implementation of local quantum measurements on spatially separated quantum subsystems. Depending on the underlying mathematical model, various notions of sets of quantum correlations can be defined. In this paper we prove separations of such sets of quantum correlations. In particular, we show that the set of bipartite quantum correlations with four binary measurements per party becomes strictly smaller once we . restrict the local Hilbert spaces to be finite dimensional, i.e., C-q((4,4,2,2)) not equal C-qs((4,4,2,2)). We also prove non-closure of the set of bipartite quantum correlations with four ternary measurements per party, i.e., C-qs((4,4,3,3)) not equal C-qa((4,4,3,3)).

TI Observing quantum coherence from photons scattered in free-space
SO LIGHT-SCIENCE & APPLICATIONS
AB Quantum channels in free-space, an essential prerequisite for fundamental tests of quantum mechanics and quantum technologies in open space, have so far been based on direct line-of-sight because the predominant approaches for photon-encoding, including polarization and spatial modes, are not compatible with randomly scattered photons. Here we demonstrate a novel approach to transfer and recover quantum coherence from scattered, non-line-of-sight photons analyzed in a multimode and imaging interferometer for time-bins, combined with photon detection based on a 8x8 single-photon-detector-array. The observed time-bin visibility for scattered photons remained at a high 95% over a wide scattering angle range of -45(0) to +45(0), while the individual pixels in the detector array resolve or track an image in its field of view of ca. 0.5 degrees. Using our method, we demonstrate the viability of two novel applications. Firstly, using scattered photons as an indirect channel for quantum communication thereby enabling non-line-of-sight quantum communication with background suppression, and secondly, using the combined arrival time and quantum coherence to enhance the contrast of low-light imaging and laser ranging under high background light. We believe our method will instigate new lines for research and development on applying photon coherence from scattered signals to quantum sensing, imaging, and communication in free-space environments.

TI Vacancy dynamics in niobium and its native oxides and their potential
   implications for quantum computing and superconducting accelerators
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
AB In recent years, superconducting radio-frequency (SRF) cavities have been considered as candidates for qubits in quantum computing, showing longer photon lifetimes and, therefore, longer decoherence times of a cavity stored qubit compared to many other realizations. In modern particle accelerators, SRF cavities are the workhorse. Continuous research and development efforts are being undertaken to improve their properties, i.e., to increase the accelerating field and lower the surface resistance, which in turn increase the energy reach and duty cycle of accelerators. While some experimental milestones have been achieved, the mechanisms behind the still observed losses remain not fully understood. In this contribution we are going to show that a recently reported temperature treatment of Nb SRF cavities in the temperature range of 573-673 K, which reduces the residual surface resistance to unprecedented values, is linked to a reorganization of the niobium oxide and near-surface vacancy structure and that this reorganization can explain the observed improved performance in both applications, quantum computing and SRF cavities.

TI Time and Query Complexity Tradeoffs for the Dihedral Coset Problem

CT 14th International Workshop on Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQCrypto)
CY AUG 14-18, 2023
CL College Park, MD
AB The Dihedral Coset Problem (DCP) in Z(N) has been extensively studied in quantum computing and post-quantum cryptography, as for instance, the Learning with Errors problem reduces to it. While the Ettinger-Hoyer algorithm is known to solve the DCP in O (logN) queries, it runs inefficiently in time O (N). The first time-efficient algorithm was introduced (and later improved) by Kuperberg (SIAM J. Comput. 2005). These algorithms run in a subexponential amount of time and queries (O) over tilde (2 root cDCP log N for some constant c(DCP).
   The sieving algorithms a la Kuperberg admit many trade-offs between quantum and classical time, memory and queries. Some of these trade-offs allow the attacker to reduce the number of queries if they are particularly costly, which is notably the case in the post-quantum key-exchange CSIDH. Such optimizations have already been studied, but they typically fall into two categories: the resulting algorithm is either based on Regev's approach of reducing the DCP with quadratic queries to a subset-sum instance, or on a re-optimization of Kuperberg's sieve where the time and queries are both subexponential.
   In this paper, we introduce the first algorithm to improve in the linear queries regime over the Ettinger-Hoyer algorithm. We then show that we can in fact interpolate between this algorithm and Kuperberg's sieve, by using the latter in a pre-processing step to create several quantum states, and solving a quantum subset-sum instance to recover the full secret in one pass from the obtained states. This allows to interpolate smoothly between the linear queries-exponential time complexity case and the subexponential query and time complexity case, thus allowing a fine tuning of the complexity taking into account the query cost. We also give on our way a precise study of quantum subset-sum algorithms in the non-asymptotic regime.

TI Universal Approximation Property of Quantum Machine Learning Models in
   Quantum-Enhanced Feature Spaces
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB Encoding classical data into quantum states is considered a quantum feature map to map classical data into a quantum Hilbert space. This feature map provides opportunities to incorporate quantum advantages into machine learning algorithms to be performed on near-term intermediate-scale quantum computers. The crucial idea is using the quantum Hilbert space as a quantum-enhanced feature space in machine learning models. Although the quantum feature map has demonstrated its capability when combined with linear classification models in some specific applications, its expressive power from the theoretical perspective remains unknown. We prove that the machine learning models induced from the quantum-enhanced feature space are universal approximators of continuous functions under typical quantum feature maps. We also study the capability of quantum feature maps in the classification of disjoint regions. Our work enables an important theoretical analysis to ensure that machine learning algorithms based on quantum feature maps can handle a broad class of machine learning tasks. In light of this, one can design a quantum machine learning model with more powerful expressivity.

AB Pharmaceutical patent analysis is the key to product protection for pharmaceutical companies. In patent claims, a Markush structure is a standard chemical structure drawing with variable substituents. Overlaps between apparently dissimilar Markush structures are nearly unrecognizable when the structures span a broad chemical space. We propose a quantum search-based method which performs an exact comparison between two non-enumerated Markush structures with a constraint satisfaction oracle. The quantum circuit is verified with a quantum simulator and the real effect of noise is estimated using a five-qubit superconductivity-based IBM quantum computer. The possibilities of measuring the correct states can be increased by improving the connectivity of the most computation intensive qubits. Depolarizing error is the most influential error. The quantum method to exactly compares two patents is hard to simulate classically and thus creates a quantum advantage in patent analysis.

TI Fast Estimation of Outcome Probabilities for Quantum Circuits
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB We present two classical algorithms for the simulation of universal quantum circuits on n qubits constructed from c instances of Clifford gates and t arbitrary-angle Z-rotation gates such as T gates. Our algorithms complement each other by performing best in different parameter regimes. The ESTIMATE algorithm produces an additive precision estimate of the Born-rule probability of a chosen measurement outcome with the only source of run-time inefficiency being a linear dependence on the stabilizer extent (with scaling approximately equal to 1.17(t) for T gates). Our algorithm is state of the art for this task: as an example, in approximately 13 h (on a standard desktop computer), we estimate the Born-rule probability to within an additive error of 0.03, for a 50-qubit, 60 non-Clifford gate quantum circuit with more than 2000 Clifford gates. Our second algorithm, COMPUTE, calculates the probability of a chosen measurement outcome to machine precision with run time O(2(t-r)t), where r is an efficiently computable, circuit-specific quantity. With high probability, r is very close to min {t, n - w} for random circuits with many Clifford gates, where w is the number of measured qubits. COMPUTE can be effective in surprisingly challenging parameter regimes, e.g., we can randomly sample Clifford+T circuits with n = 55, w = 5, c = 10(5), and t = 80 T gates, and then compute the Born-rule probability with a run time consistently less than 10 min using a single core of a standard desktop computer. We provide a C+Python implementation of our algorithms and benchmark them using random circuits, the hidden-shift algorithm, and the quantum approximate optimization algorithm.

Here, we report results for the implementation and characterization of a three-qubit Grover search algorithm using the state-of-the-art scalable quantum computing technology of superconducting quantum architectures. To delve into the algorithm's scalability and performance metrics, our investigation spans the execution of the algorithm across all eight conceivable single-result oracles, alongside nine two-result oracles, employing IBM Quantum's 127-qubit quantum computers. Moreover, we conduct five quantum state tomography experiments to precisely gauge the behavior and efficiency of our implemented algorithm under diverse conditions - ranging from noisy, noise-free environments to the complexities of real-world quantum hardware. By connecting theoretical concepts with real-world experiments, this study not only shed light on the potential of Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum Computers in facilitating large-scale database searches but also offer valuable insights into the practical application of the Grover search algorithm in real-world quantum computing applications.

TI Quantum face recognition protocol with ghost imaging
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB Face recognition is one of the most ubiquitous examples of pattern recognition in machine learning, with numerous applications in security, access control, and law enforcement, among many others. Pattern recognition with classical algorithms requires significant computational resources, especially when dealing with high-resolution images in an extensive database. Quantum algorithms have been shown to improve the efficiency and speed of many computational tasks, and as such, they could also potentially improve the complexity of the face recognition process. Here, we propose a quantum machine learning algorithm for pattern recognition based on quantum principal component analysis, and quantum independent component analysis. A novel quantum algorithm for finding dissimilarity in the faces based on the computation of trace and determinant of a matrix (image) is also proposed. The overall complexity of our pattern recognition algorithm is O(N log N)-N is the image dimension. As an input to these pattern recognition algorithms, we consider experimental images obtained from quantum imaging techniques with correlated photons, e.g. "interaction-free" imaging or "ghost" imaging. Interfacing these imaging techniques with our quantum pattern recognition processor provides input images that possess a better signal-to-noise ratio, lower exposures, and higher resolution, thus speeding up the machine learning process further. Our fully quantum pattern recognition system with quantum algorithm and quantum inputs promises a much-improved image acquisition and identification system with potential applications extending beyond face recognition, e.g., in medical imaging for diagnosing sensitive tissues or biology for protein identification.

TI Quantum simulation of boson-related Hamiltonians: techniques, effective
   Hamiltonian construction, and error analysis
SO QUANTUM SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB Elementary quantum mechanics proposes that a closed physical system consistently evolves in a reversible manner. However, control and readout necessitate the coupling of the quantum system to the external environment, subjecting it to relaxation and decoherence. Consequently, system-environment interactions are indispensable for simulating physically significant theories. A broad spectrum of physical systems in condensed-matter and high-energy physics, vibrational spectroscopy, and circuit and cavity QED necessitates the incorporation of bosonic degrees of freedom, such as phonons, photons, and gluons, into optimized fermion algorithms for near-future quantum simulations. In particular, when a quantum system is surrounded by an external environment, its basic physics can usually be simplified to a spin or fermionic system interacting with bosonic modes. Nevertheless, troublesome factors such as the magnitude of the bosonic degrees of freedom typically complicate the direct quantum simulation of these interacting models, necessitating the consideration of a comprehensive plan. This strategy should specifically include a suitable fermion/boson-to-qubit mapping scheme to encode sufficiently large yet manageable bosonic modes, and a method for truncating and/or downfolding the Hamiltonian to the defined subspace for performing an approximate but highly accurate simulation, guided by rigorous error analysis. In this pedagogical tutorial review, we aim to provide such an exhaustive strategy, focusing on encoding and simulating certain bosonic-related model Hamiltonians, inclusive of their static properties and time evolutions. Specifically, we emphasize two aspects: (1) the discussion of recently developed quantum algorithms for these interacting models and the construction of effective Hamiltonians, and (2) a detailed analysis regarding a tightened error bound for truncating the bosonic modes for a class of fermion-boson interacting Hamiltonians.

TI Discerning Amyloid-β and Tau Pathologies with Learning-Based Quantum
   Sensing
SO ACS PHOTONICS
AB Photon entanglement, a key feature of quantum correlations, provides a level of coherence absent in classical correlations, potentially offering new information when interacting with biological matter. One promising application is using entanglement decoherence to distinguish between healthy and diseased samples. However, achieving this requires efficient entangled photon sources capable of surviving through biological samples for reliable detection. In this work, we show the applicability of a polarization-entangled photon source as a label-free diagnostic tool for distinguishing between transgenic mouse models of amyloidosis and tauopathy and their respective control strains. We investigated cortical and hippocampal regions of these models, and our findings revealed greater preservation of entanglement in the transgenic samples compared to controls. To further enhance classification accuracy, we employed a supervised machine learning approach, achieving reliable distinctions between disease and control groups in unseen test samples. The quantum-based results were further validated through confocal imaging of the transgenic and control samples. These findings suggest that quantum sensing could serve as a label-free approach for distinguishing biological samples, with potential applications in the study of neurodegenerative disorders.

TI Multiplexed Scanning Microscopy with Dual-Qubit Spin Sensors
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB Scanning probe microscopy with multiqubit sensors offers the potential to improve imaging speed and measure previously inaccessible quantities, such as two-point correlations. We develop a multiplexed quantum sensing approach with scanning probes containing two nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers at the tip apex. A shared optical channel is used for simultaneous qubit initialization and readout, while phase- and frequency-dependent microwave spin manipulations are leveraged for demultiplexing the optical readout signal. Scanning dual-NV magnetometry is first demonstrated by simultaneously imaging multiple field projections of a ferrimagnetic racetrack device. Then, we record the two-point covariance of spatially correlated field fluctuations across a current-carrying wire. Our multiplex framework establishes a method to investigate a variety of spatiotemporal correlations, including phase transitions and electronic noise, with nanoscale resolution.

TI A novel qutrit representation for RGB digital images
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB Ternary Quantum Image Processing (TQIP) leverages the power of qutrits to enhance Quantum Image Processing (QIP) by enabling higher information density, reducing error rates, and simplifying circuit complexity compared to traditional binary quantum systems. Inspired by the ENEQR binary model, this paper introduces the Ternary Novel Colored Quantum Representation (TNCQR), a qutrit-based model for encoding RGB digital images in a ternary quantum system. The TNCQR model requires fewer qutrits than the number of qubits needed in equivalent binary models. By incorporating a single ancilla qutrit, the model reduces the depth of high-complexity gates, thereby lowering the overall quantum cost and improving time complexity. To simplify the constructed circuits, an optimization algorithm is presented, consisting of 2 general phases applicable to any image size and one conditional phase specific to each image. This makes TNCQR an efficient, scalable, and resource-optimized quantum image representation model.

TI Visualization of all two-qubit states via partial-transpose moments
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Efficiently detecting entanglement based on measurable quantities is a basic problem for quantum information processing. Recently, the measurable quantities called partial-transpose (PT) moments have been proposed to detect and characterize entanglement. Recently [L. Zhang et al., Ann. Phys. (Berlin) 534, 2200289 (2022)], we have already identified the two-dimensional region, comprised of the second and third PT moments, corresponding to two-qubit entangled states, and described the whole region for all two-qubit states. In the present paper, we visualize the three-dimensional (3D) region corresponding to all two-qubit states by further involving the fourth PT moment (the last one for two-qubit states). The characterization of this 3D region can finally be achieved by optimizing some polynomials. Furthermore, we identify the dividing surface which separates the two parts of the whole 3D region corresponding to entangled and separable states, respectively. Due to the measurability of PT moments, we obtain a complete and operational criterion for the detection of two-qubit entanglement.

TI Quantum Architecture Search with Neural Predictor Based on Graph
   Measures
SO ADVANCED QUANTUM TECHNOLOGIES
AB Quantum architecture search (QAS) has attracted increasing attention owing to its remarkable ability to automate the design of quantum circuits for variational quantum algorithms (VQAs). However, evaluating the performance of numerous quantum circuits is essential to provide feedback for the search strategy, which inevitably renders QAS computationally expensive. Performance predictors have emerged as highly efficient evaluation methods to mitigate this challenge. However, the performance predictor faces a critical challenge in reducing the required number of circuit-performance pairs for training. This study encodes circuit architecture by representing a quantum circuit as a relational graph that emphasizes message exchange. Subsequently, valuable information about circuit architecture is extracted through three types of graph measures, including distance-based, degree-based, and cluster-based measures. The graph measures define a smooth space related to circuit performance, facilitating the training of the performance predictor. The effectiveness of the proposed method is assessed across three tasks within variational quantum eigensolvers (VQE): identifying the ground states of the Transverse Field Ising Model (TFIM), the Heisenberg model, and the BeH2$\text{BeH}_2$ molecule. The simulation results demonstrate notable enhancements in predictive accuracy achieved by our method, coupled with a substantial reduction in the required number of training samples for the predictor.

TI Quantum Computing in the Realm of Neurosurgery
SO WORLD NEUROSURGERY
AB Quantum computing leverages the principles of quantum mechanics to provide unprecedented computational power by processing data in a fundamentally different way from classical binary computers. Quantum computers use "qubits" which superimpose 0 and 1. Because qubits can exist in multiple states at the same time, quantum computers can perform "quantum parallelism" wherein data are processed simultaneously rather than sequentially. The quantum parallelism is what enables the computer to have exponentially larger processing capabilities and consider all potential outcomes simultaneously to derive solutions. Our study aims to explore aspects of neurosurgery through which quantum computing could improve patient outcomes and enhance quality of care. Quantum computing has the potential for future applications in neuroprosthetics, neurostimulation, surgical precision, diagnosis, and patient privacy and security. It promises improved patient outcomes, enhanced surgical precision, and personalized healthcare delivery. With its inherent sensitivity and precision, quantum computing could advance the understanding of disease processes and development, providing neurosurgeons with deeper insight into patient pathologies. Challenges such as biocompatibility, cost, and ethical considerations remain significant barriers to integrating the technology into neurosurgical practice. Addressing these challenges will be crucial for realizing the transformative potential of quantum computing in advancing neurosurgical care and improving clinical outcomes.

TI Variational Quantum Algorithm for Solving the Liouvillian Gap
SO CHINESE PHYSICS LETTERS
AB In open quantum systems, the Liouvillian gap characterizes the relaxation time toward the steady state. However, accurately computing this quantity is notoriously difficult due to the exponential growth of the Hilbert space and the non-Hermitian nature of the Liouvillian superoperator. In this work, we propose a variational quantum algorithm for efficiently estimating the Liouvillian gap. By utilizing the Choi-Jamio & lstrok;kowski isomorphism, we reformulate the problem as finding the first excitation energy of an effective non-Hermitian Hamiltonian. Our method employs variance minimization with an orthogonality constraint to locate the first excited state and adopts a two-stage optimization scheme to enhance convergence. Moreover, to address scenarios with degenerate steady states, we introduce an iterative energy-offset scanning technique. Numerical simulations on the dissipative XXZ model confirm the accuracy and robustness of our algorithm across a range of system sizes and dissipation strengths. These results demonstrate the promise of variational quantum algorithms for simulating open quantum many-body systems on near-term quantum hardware.

TI Biomolecular and quantum algorithms for the dominating set problem in
   arbitrary networks
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB A dominating set of a graph G = (V, E) is a subset U of its vertices V, such that any vertex of G is either in U, or has a neighbor in U. The dominating-set problem is to find a minimum dominating set in G. Dominating sets are of critical importance for various types of networks/graphs, and find therefore potential applications in many fields. Particularly, in the area of communication, dominating sets are prominently used in the efficient organization of large-scale wireless ad hoc and sensor networks. However, the dominating set problem is also a hard optimization problem and thus currently is not efficiently solvable on classical computers. Here, we propose a biomolecular and a quantum algorithm for this problem, where the quantum algorithm provides a quadratic speedup over any classical algorithm. We show that the dominating set problem can be solved in O(2(n/2)) queries by our proposed quantum algorithm, where n is the number of vertices in G. We also demonstrate that our quantum algorithm is the best known procedure to date for this problem. We confirm the correctness of our algorithm by executing it on IBM Quantum's qasm simulator and the Brooklyn superconducting quantum device. And lastly, we show that molecular solutions obtained from solving the dominating set problem are represented in terms of a unit vector in a finite-dimensional Hilbert space.

SO NPJ QUANTUM INFORMATION
AB Exploiting the fundamental features of quantum mechanics, an entanglement-based quantum network offers a promising platform for many dramatic applications such as multi-user cryptography. Nevertheless, the implementation of a large-scale quantum network in real-world scenarios remains challenging owing to the multiple scattering events in complex environment, particularly those frequency-sensitive scatterings that disturb quantum correlation both spatially and temporally. Here, we demonstrate the frequency-insensitive spatiotemporal control of entangled photons in a fully connected network by leveraging a Fourier-transform setup and the genetic algorithm. Such an approach can effectively improve the entanglement distribution process through a multimode fiber while the quantum characteristic of the network can be maintained well after the spatiotemporal shaping. Our scheme can serve as a bridging technology to establish entanglement between remote nodes of spectrally interconnected quantum systems and has great potential applications in future real-world quantum networks.

TI Clinical data classification with noisy intermediate scale quantum
   computers
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB Quantum machine learning has experienced significant progress in both software and hardware development in the recent years and has emerged as an applicable area of near-term quantum computers. In this work, we investigate the feasibility of utilizing quantum machine learning (QML) on real clinical datasets. We propose two QML algorithms for data classification on IBM quantum hardware: a quantum distance classifier (qDS) and a simplified quantum-kernel support vector machine (sqKSVM). We utilize these different methods using the linear time quantum data encoding technique (log(2)N) for embedding classical data into quantum states and estimating the inner product on the 15-qubit IBMQ Melbourne quantum computer. We match the predictive performance of our QML approaches with prior QML methods and with their classical counterpart algorithms for three open-access clinical datasets. Our results imply that the qDS in small sample and feature count datasets outperforms kernel-based methods. In contrast, quantum kernel approaches outperform qDS in high sample and feature count datasets. We demonstrate that the log(2)N encoding increases predictive performance with up to + 2% area under the receiver operator characteristics curve across all quantum machine learning approaches, thus, making it ideal for machine learning tasks executed in Noisy Intermediate Scale Quantum computers.

SO MACHINE LEARNING-SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB Machine Learning for ligand based virtual screening (LB-VS) is an important in-silico tool for discovering new drugs in a faster and cost-effective manner, especially for emerging diseases such as COVID-19. In this paper, we propose a general-purpose framework combining a classical Support Vector Classifier algorithm with quantum kernel estimation for LB-VS on real-world databases, and we argue in favor of its prospective quantum advantage. Indeed, we heuristically prove that our quantum integrated workflow can, at least in some relevant instances, provide a tangible advantage compared to state-of-art classical algorithms operating on the same datasets, showing strong dependence on target and features selection method. Finally, we test our algorithm on IBM Quantum processors using ADRB2 and COVID-19 datasets, showing that hardware simulations provide results in line with the predicted performances and can surpass classical equivalents.

TI Steering entanglement through exceptional points in non-hermitian cavity
   magnomechanics
SO NPJ QUANTUM MATERIALS
AB Cavity magnomechanical systems, which coherently couple magnons, photons, and phonons, offer a powerful platform for exploring quantum phenomena and developing hybrid quantum technologies. We study a non-Hermitian cavity magnomechanical system featuring a yttrium iron garnet (YIG) sphere driven by an external magnetic field, where magnons interact with cavity photons via magnetic dipole coupling and with phonons via magnetostrictive forces. Non-Hermiticity is introduced through a traveling optical field that directly excites the YIG sphere, enabling precise control over parity-time (PT) symmetry. Analysis of the eigenfrequency spectrum reveals a third-order exceptional point (EP) that demarcates distinct PT-symmetric phases: a unique configuration with coexisting broken and protected PT-symmetry regimes, tunable via the interplay of the traveling field strength and magnon-photon coupling. We also verify this by measuring the divergence around EP with Petermann Factor. Crucially, the system exhibits stable PT-symmetry only at specific field incidence angles, with instability or broken symmetry dominating elsewhere. Beyond PT-symmetry, we demonstrate robust quantum entanglement among the magnon, photon, and phonon subsystems. The exceptional point serves as a critical boundary, with unbroken and broken PT symmetry phases enabling dynamic entanglement swapping between subsystem pairs. By modulating the non-Hermitian parameters, we achieve controlled entanglement transfer and suppression of fluctuations, highlighting the system's potential for quantum information processing. These results establish a direct connection between non-Hermitian topology, dynamical stability, and quantum correlations, providing a framework for leveraging PT symmetry in cavity magnomechanics for quantum technologies.

TI Quantum circuit mutants: Empirical analysis and recommendations
SO EMPIRICAL SOFTWARE ENGINEERING
AB As a new research area, quantum software testing lacks systematic testing benchmarks to assess testing techniques' effectiveness. Recently, some open-source benchmarks and mutation analysis tools have emerged. However, there is insufficient evidence on how various quantum circuit characteristics (e.g., circuit depth, number of quantum gates), algorithms (e.g., Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm), and mutation characteristics (e.g., mutation operators) affect the detection of mutants in quantum circuits. Studying such relations is important to systematically design faulty benchmarks with varied attributes (e.g., the difficulty in detecting a seeded fault) to facilitate assessing the cost-effectiveness of quantum software testing techniques efficiently. To this end, we present a large-scale empirical evaluation with more than 700K faulty benchmarks (quantum circuits) generated by mutating 382 real-world quantum circuits. Based on the results, we provide valuable insights for researchers to define systematic quantum mutation analysis techniques. We also provide a tool to recommend mutants to users based on chosen characteristics (e.g., a quantum algorithm type) and the required difficulty of detecting mutants. Finally, we also provide faulty benchmarks that can already be used to assess the cost-effectiveness of quantum software testing techniques.

TI Quantum-accelerated active distribution network planning based on
   coherent photonic quantum computers
SO IENERGY
AB Active distribution network (ADN) planning is crucial for achieving a cost-effective transition to modern power systems, yet it poses significant challenges as the system scale increases. The advent of quantum computing offers a transformative approach to solve ADN planning. To fully leverage the potential of quantum computing, this paper proposes a photonic quantum acceleration algorithm. First, a quantum-accelerated framework for ADN planning is proposed on the basis of coherent photonic quantum computers. The ADN planning model is then formulated and decomposed into discrete master problems and continuous subproblems to facilitate the quantum optimization process. The photonic quantum-embedded adaptive alternating direction method of multipliers (PQA-ADMM) algorithm is subsequently proposed to equivalently map the discrete master problem onto a quantum-interpretable model, enabling its deployment on a photonic quantum computer. Finally, a comparative analysis with various solvers, including Gurobi, demonstrates that the proposed PQA-ADMM algorithm achieves significant speedup on the modified IEEE 33-node and IEEE 123-node systems, highlighting its effectiveness.

TI Nonlocal Temporal Interferometry for Highly Resilient Free-Space Quantum
   Communication
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW X
AB Entanglement distribution via photons over long distances enables many applications, including quantum key distribution, which provides unprecedented privacy. The inevitable degradation of entanglement through noise accumulated over long distances remains one of the key challenges in this area. Exploiting the potential of higher-dimensional entangled photons promises to address this challenge, but poses extreme demands on the experimental implementation. Here, we present a long-range free-space quantum link, distributing entanglement over 10.2 km with flexible dimensionality of encoding by deploying a phase-stable nonlocal Franson interferometer. With this distribution of multidimensional energy-time entangled photons, we analyze the achievable key rate in a dimensionally adaptive quantum key distribution protocol that can be optimized with respect to any environmental noise conditions. Our approach enables and emphasizes the power of high-dimensional entanglement for quantum communi-cation, yielding a positive asymptotic key rate well into the dawn of the day.

TI SU(2) hadrons on a quantum computer via a variational approach
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Quantum computers have the potential to create important new opportunities for ongoing essential research on gauge theories. They can provide simulations that are unattainable on classical computers such as sign-problem afflicted models or time evolutions. In this work, we variationally prepare the low-lying eigenstates of a non-Abelian gauge theory with dynamically coupled matter on a quantum computer. This enables the observation of hadrons and the calculation of their associated masses. The SU(2) gauge group considered here represents an important first step towards ultimately studying quantum chromodynamics, the theory that describes the properties of protons, neutrons and other hadrons. Our calculations on an IBM superconducting platform utilize a variational quantum eigensolver to study both meson and baryon states, hadrons which have never been seen in a non-Abelian simulation on a quantum computer. We develop a hybrid resource-efficient approach by combining classical and quantum computing, that not only allows the study of an SU(2) gauge theory with dynamical matter fields on present-day quantum hardware, but further lays out the premises for future quantum simulations that will address currently unanswered questions in particle and nuclear physics.
   Quantum simulations of lattice gauge theories are in principle scalable, but their extension to dynamically coupled matter has proven difficult. In this work, the authors use a variational quantum eigensolver to simulate a non-Abelian LGT including the effects of both gauge fields and dynamical fermions.

TI Controlling the dynamics of ultracold polar molecules in optical
   tweezers
SO NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB Ultracold molecules trapped in optical tweezers show great promise for the implementation of quantum technologies and precision measurements. We study a prototypical scenario where two interacting polar molecules placed in separate traps are controlled using an external electric field. This, for instance, enables a quantum computing scheme in which the rotational structure is used to encode the qubit states. We estimate the typical operation timescales needed for state engineering to be in the range of few microseconds. We further underline the important role of the spatial structure of the two-body states, with the potential for significant gate speedup employing trap-induced resonances.

TI Preparation of spectrally pure single-photon source at 3 μm mid-infrared
   band from lithium niobate crystal with domain sequence algorithm
SO ACTA PHYSICA SINICA
AB The single-photon source in mid-infrared (MIR) band is very important for the next generation of quantum sensing, quantum communication and quantum imaging. At present, the commonly used method of generating MIR single-photon source is based on the spontaneous parametric down conversion (SPDC) process in the periodically poled lithium niobate (PPLN) crystal. However, the spectral purity of single-photon source based on the ordinary PPLN is not high, specifically, its maximum value is only about 0.82, which affects the fidelity of quantum information processing scheme. In this paper, 4000 polarized domains in a 30-mm-long LN crystal are customized by using the domain design theory. The sidelobes in the phase matching function are eliminated, and the Gaussian distribution is obtained. The calculated spectral purity of the single-photon source can reach 0.99, and its tunable range is 2.7-3.3 mu m. The customized poled lithium niobate (CPLN) is expected to provide a single-photon source with excellent performance for the study of quantum information in the MIR band.

AB Satellite nodes are an enabler of global quantum networks by overcoming the distance limitations of fiber and free-space links on ground. The design of quantum sources and receivers for satellites, however, is challenging in terms of size, weight, and power consumption, as well as mechanical and thermal stability. This is all the more true for cost-efficient nanosatellites such as the popular CubeSat platform standard.
   Here we report on the follow-up mission of SpooQy-1, a 3U CubeSat that successfully demonstrated the generation of polarization-entangled photons in orbit. The next iteration of the mission will showcase satellite-to-ground quantum key distribution based on a compact source of polarization-entangled photon-pairs, and we have recently completed the integration of a fully functional demonstrator as a milestone towards the flight model.
   We also briefly describe the design of the optical ground station that we are currently building in Singapore for receiving the quantum signal. We present the most important subsystems and illustrate the concept of operation.

TI Quantum entanglement and Bell inequality violation in semi-leptonic top
   decays
SO JOURNAL OF HIGH ENERGY PHYSICS
AB Quantum entanglement is a fundamental property of quantum mechanics. Recently, studies have explored entanglement in the tt<overline>\documentclass[12pt]{minimal} \usepackage{amsmath} \usepackage{wasysym} \usepackage{amsfonts} \usepackage{amssymb} \usepackage{amsbsy} \usepackage{mathrsfs} \usepackage{upgreek} \setlength{\oddsidemargin}{-69pt} \begin{document}$$ t\overline{t} $$\end{document} system at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) when both the top quark and anti-top quark decay leptonically. Entanglement is detected via correlations between the polarizations of the top and anti-top and these polarizations are measured through the angles of the decay products of the top and anti-top. In this work, we propose searching for evidence of quantum entanglement in the semi-leptonic decay channel where the final state includes one lepton, one neutrino, two b-flavor tagged jets, and two light jets from the W decay. We find that this channel is both easier to reconstruct and has a larger effective quantity of data than the fully leptonic channel. As a result, the semi-leptonic channel is 60% more sensitive to quantum entanglement and a factor of 3 more sensitive to Bell inequality violation, compared to the leptonic channel. In 139 fb-1 (3 ab-1) of data at the LHC (HL-LHC), it should be feasible to measure entanglement at a precision of less than or similar to 3% (0.7%). Detecting Bell inequality violation, on the other hand, is more challenging. With 300 fb-1 (3 ab-1) of integrated luminosity at the LHC Run-3 (HL-LHC), we expect a sensitivity of 1.3 sigma (4.1 sigma). In our study, we utilize a realistic parametric fitting procedure to optimally recover the true angular distributions from detector effects. Compared to unfolding this procedure yields more stable results.

TI Explicit Quantum Circuit for Simulating the Advection-Diffusion-Reaction
   Dynamics
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON QUANTUM ENGINEERING
AB We assess the convergence of the Carleman linearization of advection-diffusion-reaction (ADR) equations with a logistic nonlinearity. It is shown that five Carleman iterates provide a satisfactory approximation of the original ADR across a broad range of parameters and strength of nonlinearity. To assess the feasibility of a quantum algorithm based on this linearization, we analyze the projection of the Carleman ADR matrix onto the tensor Pauli basis. It is found that the Carleman ADR matrix requires an exponential number of Pauli gates as a function of the number of qubits. This prevents the practical implementation of the Carleman approach to the quantum simulation of ADR problems on current hardware. We propose to address this limitation by resorting to block-encoding techniques for sparse matrix employing oracles. Such quantum ADR oracles are presented in explicit form and shown to turn the exponential complexity into a polynomial one. However, due to the low probability of successfully implementing the nonunitary Carleman operator, further research is needed to implement the multitimestep version of the present circuit.

TI Process tomography of robust dynamical decoupling with superconducting
   qubits
SO QUANTUM INFORMATION PROCESSING
AB Dynamical decoupling is a technique that protects qubits against noise. The ability to preserve quantum coherence in the presence of noise is essential for developing quantum devices. Here, the Rigetti quantum computing platform was used to test different dynamical decoupling sequences in a single qubit. The performance of the sequences was characterized by quantum process tomography and analyzed using the quantum channels formalism. Pulse imperfections are shown here to limit the performance of dynamical decoupling on the Rigetti's qubits. However, the performance can be improved using robust dynamical decoupling, i.e., sequences that are robust against experimental imperfections. The sequences tested here outperformed previous dynamical decoupling sequences tested in the same platform.

TI Optimal entanglement distribution policies in homogeneous repeater
   chains with cutoffs
SO NPJ QUANTUM INFORMATION
AB We study the limits of bipartite entanglement distribution using a chain of quantum repeaters that have quantum memories. To generate end-to-end entanglement, each node can attempt the generation of an entangled link with a neighbor, or perform an entanglement swapping measurement. A maximum storage time, known as cutoff, is enforced on the memories to ensure high-quality entanglement. Nodes follow a policy that determines when to perform each operation. Global-knowledge policies take into account all the information about the entanglement already produced. Here, we find global-knowledge policies that minimize the expected time to produce end-to-end entanglement. Our methods are based on Markov decision processes and value and policy iteration. We compare optimal policies to a policy in which nodes only use local information. We find that the advantage in expected delivery time provided by an optimal global-knowledge policy increases with increasing number of nodes and decreasing probability of successful swapping.

TI High-Sensitivity ac-Charge Detection with a MHz-Frequency Fluxonium
   Qubit
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW X
AB Owing to their strong dipole moment and long coherence times, superconducting qubits have demonstrated remarkable success in hybrid quantum circuits. However, most qubit architectures are limited to the GHz frequency range, severely constraining the class of systems they can interact with. The fluxonium qubit, on the other hand, can be biased to very low frequency while being manipulated and read out with standard microwave techniques. Here, we design and operate a heavy fluxonium with an unprecedentedly low transition frequency of 1.8 MHz. We demonstrate resolved sideband cooling of the "hot" qubit transition with a final ground state population of 97.7%, corresponding to an effective temperature of 23 mu K. We further demonstrate coherent manipulation with coherence times T-1 = 34 mu s, T-2* = 39 mu s, and single-shot readout of the qubit state. Importantly, by directly addressing the qubit transition with a capacitively coupled waveguide, we showcase its high sensitivity to a radio-frequency field. Through cyclic qubit preparation and interrogation, we transform this low-frequency fluxonium qubit into a frequency-resolved charge sensor. This method results in a charge sensitivity of 33 mu e/root Hz, or an energy sensitivity (in joules per hertz) of 2.8h. This method rivals state-of-the-art transport-based devices, while maintaining inherent insensitivity to dc-charge noise. The high charge sensitivity combined with large capacitive shunt unlocks new avenues for exploring quantum phenomena in the 1-10 MHz range, such as the strong-coupling regime with a resonant macroscopic mechanical resonator.

AB The Quantum Fourier Transform (QFT) grants competitive advantages, especially in resource usage and circuit approximation, for performing arithmetic operations on quantum computers, and offers a potential route towards a numerical quantum-computational paradigm. In this paper, we utilize efficient techniques to implement QFT-based integer addition and multiplications. These operations are fundamental to various quantum applications including Shor's algorithm, weighted sum optimization problems in data processing and machine learning, and quantum algorithms requiring inner products. We carry out performance evaluations of these implementations based on IBM's superconducting qubit architecture using different compatible noise models. We isolate the sensitivity of the component quantum circuits on both one-/two-qubit gate error rates, and the number of the arithmetic operands' superposed integer states. We analyze performance, and identify the most effective approximation depths for quantum add and quantum multiply within the given context. We observe significant dependency of the optimal approximation depth on the degree of machine noise and the number of superposed states in certain performance regimes. Finally, we elaborate on the algorithmic challenges - relevant to signed, unsigned, modular and non-modular versions - that could also be applied to current implementations of QFT-based subtraction, division, exponentiation, and their potential tensor extensions. We analyze performance trends in our results and speculate on possible future development within this computational paradigm.

Cross-sectional views of the via confirmed uniform thickness of the TiN film along the via wall. In addition, the TiN film exhibited a superconducting transition at 4.5 K, demonstrating the successful deposition of a high-quality homogeneous superconducting film. This represents the first example of realizing superconducting through-substrate vias on sapphire substrates, a crucial first step toward achieving the 3-D integration of qubits while maintaining coherence time.

TI Performance Optimization for Drift-Robust Fidelity Improvement of
   Two-Qubit Gates
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW APPLIED
AB Quantum-system characterization techniques represent the front line in the identification and mitigation of noise in quantum computing but can be expensive in terms of quantum resources and time to repeatedly employ. Another challenging aspect is that the parameters governing the performance of various operations tend to drift over time and monitoring these is hence a difficult task. One of the most promising characterization techniques, gate-set tomography (GST), provides a self-consistent estimate of the completely positive trace-preserving (CPTP) maps for a complete set of gates, as well as preparation and measurement operators. We develop a method for performance optimization seeded by tomography (POST), which couples the power of GST with a classical optimization routine to achieve a consistent gate improvement in just a short number of steps within a given calibration cycle. By construction, the POST procedure finds the best available gate operation given the hardware and is therefore robust to the effects of drift. Further, in comparison to other quantum error-mitigation techniques, it builds upon a one-time application of GST. To demonstrate the performance of this method on a real quantum computer, we map out the operations of six qubit pairs on the superconducting ibmq_poughkeepsie quantum device. Under the restriction of logical-only control, we monitor the performance of the POST approach on a chosen controlled-NOT (CNOT) gate over a period of six weeks. In this time, we achieve a consistent improvement in gate fidelity, averaging a fidelity increase of 21.1% as measured by randomized benchmarking. The POST approach should find wide applicability as it is hardware agnostic and can be applied at the upper logical level or at a deeper pulse-control level.

TI Quantum entanglement and quantum geometry measured with inelastic x-ray
   scattering
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
AB Using inelastic x-ray scattering (IXS), we experimentally investigate the quantum geometry and quantum information in the large-gap insulator, LiF. Using sum rules for the density-density response function measured in IXS, we compute the quantum Fisher information of the equilibrium density matrix of LiF associated with density perturbations. Next, by exploiting universal relations between the quantum Fisher information, the optical conductivity, and the quantum metric tensor, we extrapolate the diagonal (h, k, l) = (1, 0, 0) component of the quantum metric of LiF, known as the quantum weight. We compare our results to recently proposed bounds on the quantum weight and find that the quantum weight in LiF comes close to saturating a theoretical upper bound, showing that quantum-mechanical delocalization plays an important role even in ionic insulators. Our work serves as a proof of principle that IXS techniques can be used to quantify state-of-the-art quantum geometric quantities of materials, and establishes the quantum Fisher information as an experimentally accessible generalization of quantum geometry to real materials.

TI A variational quantum perceptron with Grover's algorithm for efficient
   classification
SO PHYSICA SCRIPTA
AB This study introduces the Quantum Variational Perceptron with Grover's algorithm (QVP-G), an innovative Quantum machine Learning (QML) model significantly enhancing binary classification tasks' capabilities. The study goes beyond theoretical constructs, employing empirical evaluations of QVP-G on the well-established Iris and more complex breast cancer datasets. This dual-dataset approach highlights the model's adaptability and effectiveness in varied contexts. Our experimental findings reveal the exceptional accuracy of QVP-G, achieving a remarkable 99% success rate. This superior performance is owed mainly to integrating Grover's algorithm, a cornerstone in Quantum Computing (QC), which substantially increases the probability of accurately determining the correct classification hyperplane. Beyond academic interest, our research positions QVP-G as a powerful tool with substantial practical applications. Its utility ranges from enhancing fraud detection and improving spam filtering to expediting drug discovery and contributing to advances in physics research. This study marks a significant advancement in QML, reinforcing the bridge between QC and machine learning.

   Computers: n-Qubit (n=1-4) Toffoli Gates
SO ADVANCED QUANTUM TECHNOLOGIES
AB It is shown theoretically how to use the EPR (electron paramagnetic resonance) technique, using electron spins as qubits, coupled with each other by the exchange interaction, to set the configuration of n qubits (n = 1-4) at resonance, in conjunction with pulses, to construct the NOT (one qubit), CNOT (two qubits), CCNOT (three qubits), and CCCNOT (four qubits) Toffoli gates, which can be exploited to build a quantum computer. This is unique to EPR, wherein exchange-coupled electron spins are used. This is different from NMR (Nuclear Magnetic Resonance), which uses nuclear spins as qubits, that do not couple with each other by the exchange interaction.

TI Low-loss polarization control in fiber systems for quantum computation
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB Optical quantum information processing requires low loss interference of quantum light. Also, when the interferometer is composed of optical fibers, degradation of interference visibility due to the finite polarization extinction ratio becomes a problem. Here we propose a low loss method to optimize interference visibility by controlling the polarizations to a crosspoint of two circular trajectories on the Poincare sphere. Our method maximizes visibility with low optical loss by using fiber stretchers as polarization controllers on both paths of the interferometer. We also experimentally demonstrate our method, where the visibility was maintained basically above 99.9% for three hours using fiber stretchers with an optical loss of 0.02 dB (0.5%). Our method makes fiber systems promising for practical fault-tolerant optical quantum computers.

TI Blueprint for All-to-All-Connected Superconducting Spin Qubits
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB Andreev (or superconducting) spin qubits (ASQs) have recently emerged as a promising qubit platform that combines superconducting circuits with semiconductor spin degrees of freedom. While recent experiments have successfully coupled two ASQs, how to realize a scalable architecture for extending this coupling to multiple distant qubits remains an open question. In this work, we resolve this challenge by introducing an architecture that achieves all-to-all connectivity between multiple remote ASQs. Our approach enables selective connectivity between any qubit pair while keeping all other qubit pairs uncoupled. Furthermore, we demonstrate the feasibility of efficient readout using circuit quantum electrodynamics techniques and compare different readout configurations. Our architecture shows promise both for gate-based quantum computing and for analog quantum simulation applications by offering higher qubit connectivity than alternative solid-state platforms.

TI Preserving quantum information in f(Q) non-metric gravity
   cosmology
SO EUROPEAN PHYSICAL JOURNAL C
AB The effects of cosmological expansion on quantum bosonic states are investigated, using quantum information theory. In particular, a generic Bogoliubov transformation of bosonic field modes is considered and the state change on a single mode is regarded as the effect of a quantum channel. Properties and capacities of this channel are thus explored in the framework of f(Q) non-metric gravity. The reason is that non-metric gravity can be considered under the standard of gauge theories with all the advantages of such a formulation. As immediate result, we obtain that the information on a single-mode state appears better preserved, whenever the number of particles produced by the cosmological expansion is small. Specifically, we investigate a power law f(Q) model, leaving unaltered the effective gravitational coupling, and minimise the corresponding particle production. We thus show how to optimise the preservation of classical and quantum information, stored in bosonic mode states in the remote past. Finally, we compare our findings with those obtained in General Relativity.

TI Qubit regularized O(N) nonlinear sigma models
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW D
AB Motivated by the prospect of quantum simulation of quantum field theories, we formulate the O(N) nonlinear sigma model as a "qubit" model with an (N + 1)-dimensional local Hilbert space at each lattice site. Using an efficient worm algorithm in the worldline formulation, we demonstrate that the model has a second-order critical point in (2 + 1) dimensions, where the continuum physics of the nontrivial O(N) Wilson-Fisher fixed point is reproduced. We compute the critical exponents nu and eta for the O(N) qubit models up to N = 8, and find excellent agreement with known results in literature from various analytic and numerical techniques for the O(N) Wilson-Fisher universality class. Our models are suited for studying O(N) nonlinear sigma models on quantum computers up to N = 8 in d = 2, 3 spatial dimensions.

AB Enabling the sharing of quantum computers among different users requires a secure reset operation that can reset the state of a qubit to ground state |0 > and prevent leakage of the state to a post-reset circuit. This work highlights that the existing reset operations available in superconducting qubit NISQ quantum computers are not fully secure. In particular, this work demonstrates for the first time a new type of higher-energy state attack. Although NISQ quantum computers are typically abstracted as working with only energy states |0 > and |1 >, this work shows that it is possible for unprivileged users to set the qubit state to |2 > or |3 >. By breaking the abstraction of a two-level system, the new higher-energy state attack can be deployed to affect the operation of circuits or for covert communication between circuits. This work shows that common reset protocols are ineffective in resetting a qubit from a higher-energy state. To provide a defense, this work proposes a new Cascading Secure Reset (CSR) operation. CSR, without hardware modifications, is able to efficiently and reliably reset higher-energy states back to |0 >. CSR achieves a reduction in |3 >-initialized state leakage channel capacity by between 1 and 2 orders of magnitude, and does so with a 25x speedup compared with the default decoherence reset.

TI Quantum Teleportation and Super-Dense Coding in Operator Algebras
SO INTERNATIONAL MATHEMATICS RESEARCH NOTICES
AB We show for any d, m >= 2 with (d, m) not equal (2, 2), the matrix-valued generalization of the (tensor product) quantum correlation set of d inputs and m outputs is not closed. Our argument uses a reformulation of super-dense coding and teleportation in terms of C*-algebra isomorphisms. Namely, we prove that for certain actions of cyclic group Z(d),
   M-d(C* (F-d2)) congruent to B-d (sic) Z(d) (sic) Z(d), M-d(B-d) congruent to C* (F-d2) (sic) Z(d) (sic) Z(d),
   where B d is the universal unital C*-algebra generated by the elements u(jk), 0 <= i, j <= d-1, satisfying the relations that [u(j,k)] is a unitary operator, and C*(F-d2) is the universal C*-algebra of d(2) unitaries. These isomorphisms provide a nice connection between the embezzlement of entanglement and the non-closedness of quantum correlation sets.

TI Biased Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill repetition code
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Continuous-variable quantum computing architectures based upon the Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill (GKP) encoding have emerged as a promising candidate because one can achieve fault tolerance with a probabilistic supply of GKP states and Gaussian operations. Furthermore, by generalizing to rectangular-lattice GKP states, a bias can be introduced and exploited through concatenation with qubit codes that show improved performance under biasing. However, these codes (such as the XZZX surface code) still require weight-four stabilizer measurements and have complex decoding requirements to overcome. In this work, we study the code-capacity behavior of a rectangular-lattice GKP encoding concatenated with a repetition code under an isotropic Gaussian displacement channel. We find a numerical threshold of s = 0.599 for the noise's standard deviation, which outperforms the biased GKP planar surface code with a trade-off of increased biasing at the GKP level. This is all achieved with only weight-two stabilizer operators and simple decoding at the qubit level. Furthermore, with moderate levels of bias (aspect ratio similar to 2.4) and nine or fewer data modes, significant reductions in logical error rates can still be achieved for s similar to 0.3, opening the possibility of using biased GKP repetition codes as a simple low-level qubit encoding for further concatenation.

TI On the Exploration of Quantum Polar Stabilizer Codes and Quantum
   Stabilizer Codes with High Coding Rate
SO ENTROPY
AB Inspired by classical polar codes, whose coding rate can asymptotically achieve the Shannon capacity, researchers are trying to find their analogs in the quantum information field, which are called quantum polar codes. However, no one has designed a quantum polar coding scheme that applies to quantum computing yet. There are two intuitions in previous research. The first is that directly converting classical polar coding circuits to quantum ones will produce the polarization phenomenon of a pure quantum channel, which has been proved in our previous work. The second is that based on this quantum polarization phenomenon, one can design a quantum polar coding scheme that applies to quantum computing. There are several previous work following the second intuition, none of which has been verified by experiments. In this paper, we follow the second intuition and propose a more reasonable quantum polar stabilizer code construction algorithm than any previous ones by using the theory of stabilizer codes. Unfortunately, simulation experiments show that even the stabilizer codes obtained from this more reasonable construction algorithm do not work, which implies that the second intuition leads to a dead end. Based on the analysis of why the second intuition does not work, we provide a possible future direction for designing quantum stabilizer codes with a high coding rate by borrowing the idea of classical polar codes. Following this direction, we find a class of quantum stabilizer codes with a coding rate of 0.5, which can correct two of the Pauli errors.

TI Scalable Neural Decoder for Topological Surface Codes
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB With the advent of noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices, practical quantum computing has seemingly come into reach. However, to go beyond proof-of-principle calculations, the current processing architectures will need to scale up to larger quantum circuits which will require fast and scalable algorithms for quantum error correction. Here, we present a neural network based decoder that, for a family of stabilizer codes subject to depolarizing noise and syndrome measurement errors, is scalable to tens of thousands of qubits (in contrast to other recent machine learning inspired decoders) and exhibits faster decoding times than the state-of-the-art union find decoder for a wide range of error rates (down to 1%). The key innovation is to autodecode error syndromes on small scales by shifting a preprocessing window over the underlying code, akin to a convolutional neural network in pattern recognition approaches. We show that such a preprocessing step allows to effectively reduce the error rate by up to 2 orders of magnitude in practical applications and, by detecting correlation effects, shifts the actual error threshold up to fifteen percent higher than the threshold of conventional error correction algorithms such as union find or minimum weight perfect matching, even in the presence of measurement errors. An in situ implementation of such a machine learning-assisted quantum error correction will be a decisive step to push the entanglement frontier beyond the NISQ horizon.

TI Underwater continuous variable quantum key distribution scheme based on
   imperfect measurement basis choice
SO ACTA PHYSICA SINICA
AB Measurement basis choice is an essential step in the underwater continuous variable quantum key distribution system based on homodyne detection. However, in practice, finite bandwidth of analog-to-digital converter on the receiver's side is limited, which can result in defects in the measurement basis choice. That is, the receiver cannot accurately modulate the corresponding phase angle on the phase modulator for measurement basis choice to implement homodyne detection. The imperfect measurement basis choice will introduce extra excess noise, which affects the security of underwater continuous variable quantum key distribution scheme. To solve this problem, we propose an underwater continuous variable quantum key distribution scheme based on imperfect measurement basis choice, and analyze the influence of imperfect measurement basis choice on the performance of underwater continuous variable quantum key distribution system in detail. The research results indicate that the extra excess noise introduced by imperfect measurement basis choice can reduce the secret key rate and maximum transmission distance of the underwater Gaussian modulated quantum key distribution, thus reducing the security of the system. In order to achieve reliable underwater continuous variable quantum key distribution, we quantitatively analyze the extra excess noise introduced by choosing the imperfect measurement basis and obtain its security limit. Besides, we also consider the influence of different seawater depths on the security limit of the proposed scheme, effectively solving the security risks caused by the imperfect measurement basis choice. Furthermore, for the proposed scheme, we consider not only its asymptotic security case but also its composable security case, and the performance curves obtained in the latter are tighter than that achieved in the former. The proposed scheme aims to promote the practical process of underwater continuous variable quantum key distribution system and provide theoretical guidance for accurately evaluating the water channel parameters in underwater communication of global quantum communication networks.

TI Diamond-shaped quantum circuit for real-time quantum dynamics in one
   dimension
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB In recent years, quantum computing has evolved as an exciting frontier, with the development of numerous algorithms dedicated to constructing quantum circuits that adeptly represent quantum many-body states. However, this domain remains in its early stages and requires further refinement to better understand the effective construction of highly entangled quantum states within quantum circuits. Here, we demonstrate that quantum many-body states can be universally represented using a quantum circuit comprising multiqubit gates. Furthermore, we evaluate the efficiency of a quantum circuit constructed with two-qubit gates in quench dynamics for the transverse-field Ising model. In this specific model, despite the initial state being classical without entanglement, it undergoes long-time evolution, eventually leading to a highly entangled quantum state. Our results reveal that a diamond-shaped quantum circuit, designed to approximate the multiqubit gate-based quantum circuit, remarkably excels in accurately representing the long-time dynamics of the system. Moreover, the diamond-shaped circuit follows the volume law behavior in entanglement entropy, offering a significant advantage over alternative quantum circuit constructions employing two-qubit gates.

TI QUATERNARY CONJUCYCLIC CODES WITH AN APPLICATION TO EAQEC CODES
SO ADVANCES IN MATHEMATICS OF COMMUNICATIONS
AB Conjucyclic codes are part of a family of codes that includes cyclic, constacyclic, and quasi-cyclic codes, among others. Despite their importance in quantum error correction, they have not received much attention in the literature. This paper focuses on additive conjucyclic (ACC) codes over F-4 and investigates their properties. Specifically, we derive the duals of ACC codes by using a trace inner product and obtain the trace hull and its dimension. Also, we establish a necessary and sufficient condition for an additive code to have a complementary dual (ACD). Additionally, we identify a necessary condition for an additive conjucyclic complementary pair of codes over F-4. Furthermore, we show that the trace code of an ACC code is cyclic and provide a condition for the trace code of an ACC code to be LCD. To demonstrate the practical application of our findings, we construct some good entanglement-assisted quantum error-correcting (EAQEC) codes using the trace code of ACC codes.

TI Weak measurements enhancing the quantum information facets of a driven
   Unruh-DeWitt detector
SO FRONTIERS IN PHYSICS
AB We developed a Hermitian operator representation of the Unruh channel for a driven accelerated detector in the presence of external noise. This representation is then used to provide a generalized analytical approach to a non-inertial evolution subjected to quantum weak measurements. The quantum information facets were then improved by performing weak measurements before and after the quantum channel. The external noise was modeled using a phase damping channel. The prominent oscillations of the quantum information are caused by vacuum fluctuations of the quantum fields coupled to the detector. Steady values are obtained for the quantum coherence and quantum Fisher information using the Unruh effect. Thus, quantum weak measurements can effectively suppress the decoherence induced by the relativistic acceleration. By comparing with cases without weak measurements, we demonstrate that there exist some regions with optimal measurement strengths that enhance the quantum coherence and quantum Fisher information. The effects of conditional improvement on the quantum information facets are still obvious in the presence of external noise.

TI Suppressing spectator-induced dephasing through optimized dynamical
   decoupling implementation
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB Dynamical decoupling (DD) is a well-established technique for protecting quantum systems from environmental noise. DD effectively mitigates decoherence in superconducting quantum computing systems, where precise implementation plays a crucial role in optimizing its performance. This study investigates how DD implementation timing and sequence design critically affect spectator-induced dephasing from adjacent qubits. We find that excited states of adjacent qubits dramatically degrade operational qubit coherence. We demonstrate that DD sequences applied to adjacent qubits effectively suppress this dephasing. This protection persists even when adjacent qubits remain in superposition states during the sequence. Through systematic characterization of Carr-Purcell-Meiboom-Gill (CPMG) sequences, we show that implementation timing strongly impacts protection effectiveness. While optimal timing achieves substantial coherence enhancement, improper sequence delays can severely degrade protection. Our results highlight the importance of precise timing control for implementing DD in optimizing multi-qubit quantum circuits.

TI Quantum Entanglement and State-Transference in Fenna-Matthews-Olson
   Complexes: A Post-Experimental Simulation Analysis in the Computational
   Biology Domain
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MOLECULAR SCIENCES
AB Fenna-Mathews-Olson complexes participate in the photosynthetic process of Sulfur Green Bacteria. These biological subsystems exhibit quantum features which possibly are responsible for their high efficiency; the latter may comprise multipartite entanglement and the apparent tunnelling of the initial quantum state. At first, to study these aspects, a multidisciplinary approach including experimental biology, spectroscopy, physics, and math modelling is required. Then, a global computer modelling analysis is achieved in the computational biology domain. The current work implements the Hierarchical Equations of Motion to numerically solve the open quantum system problem regarding this complex. The time-evolved states obtained with this method are then analysed under several measures of entanglement, some of them already proposed in the literature. However, for the first time, the maximum overlap with respect to the closest separable state is employed. This authentic multipartite entanglement measure provides information on the correlations, not only based on the system bipartitions as in the usual analysis. Our study has led us to note a different view of FMO multipartite entanglement as tiny contributions to the global entanglement suggested by other more basic measurements. Additionally, in another related trend, the initial state, considered as a Forster Resonance Energy Transfer, is tracked using a novel approach, considering how it could be followed under the fidelity measure on all possible permutations of the FMO subsystems through its dynamical evolution by observing the tunnelling in the most probable locations. Both analyses demanded significant computational work, making for a clear example of the complexity required in computational biology.

TI Entanglement Percolation in Two Types of Irregular Quantum Networks
SO QUANTUM INFORMATION & COMPUTATION
AB The issue of entanglement percolation in irregular quantum networks aims to investigate how to effectively transmit and maintain entanglement resources within complex network structures. This study is based on a deterministic entanglement transmission scheme and combines star-mesh transform, analyzing the entanglement percolation threshold and saturation points in two types of irregular networks through numerical simulation. The research results indicate that, with a certain level of precision, we calculate approximate values for the entanglement percolation threshold and saturation point between two given distant nodes on the butterfly network. Furthermore, for parallel-then-series networks, we derive a general analytical expression for determining the saturation point, which can be used to predict the saturation point of such networks under different numbers of nodes and different numbers of entangled resource states between adjacent nodes. Additionally, Comparing the concurrence percolation and the CEP based on the butterfly network and the parallel-then-series network, we find that the concurrence percolation indeed exhibits quantum superiority. These results provide specific numerical references and theoretical support for optimizing the entanglement transmission of these two types of irregular quantum networks.

AB Classical simulations of quantum computations are vital for the future development of this emerging technology. To this end, decision diagrams have been proposed as a complementary technique which frequently allows to tackle the inherent exponential complexity of these simulations. In the worst case, however, they still cannot escape this complexity. Additionally, while other techniques make use of all the available processing power, decision diagram-based simulation to date cannot exploit the many processing units of today's systems. In this work, we show that both problems can be tackled together by employing a hybrid Schrodinger-Feynman scheme for the simulation. More precisely, we show that realizing such a scheme with decision diagrams is indeed possible, we discuss the resulting problems in its realization, and propose solutions how they can be handled. Experimental evaluations confirm that this significantly advances the state of the art in decision diagram-based simulation-allowing to simulate certain hard circuits within minutes that could not be simulated in a whole day thus far.

TI T-count and T-depth of any multi-qubit unitary

AB We design an algorithm to determine the (minimum) T-count of any n-qubit (n >= 1) unitary W of size 2(n) x 2(n), over the Clifford+T gate set. The space and time complexity of our algorithm are O(2(2n)) and O(2(2nT epsilon(W)+4n)), respectively. T-epsilon(W) (epsilon-T-count) is the (minimum) T-count of an exactly implementable unitary U (T (U)), such that d(U,W) <= epsilon and T (U) <= T (U ') where U ' is any exactly implementable unitary with d(U ', W) <= epsilon . d(. , .) is the global phase invariant distance. Our algorithm can also be used to determine the (minimum) T-depth as well as the minimum non-Clifford-gate count or depth required to implement any multi-qubit unitary with a finite universal gate set like Clifford+CS, Clifford+V, etc. For small enough epsilon, we can synthesize the optimal circuits.

TI Quantum frequency conversion from ultraviolet to visible band through
   waveguides in a period-poled MgO:LiTaO3 crystal
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB In research on hybrid quantum networks, visible or near-infrared frequency conversion has been realized. However, technical limitations mean that there have been few studies involving the ultraviolet band, and unfortunately the wavelengths of the rare-earth or alkaline-earth metal atoms or ions that are used widely in research on quantum information are often in the UV band. Therefore, frequency conversion of the ultraviolet band is very important. In this paper, we demonstrate a quantum frequency conversion between ultraviolet and visible wavelengths by fabricating waveguides in a period-poled MgO:LiTaO3 crystal with a laser writing system, which will be used to connect the wavelength of the dipole transition of Yb-171(+) at 369.5 nm and the absorption wavelength of Eu3+ at 580 nm in a solid-state quantum memory system. An external conversion efficiency of 0.85% and a signal-to-noise ratio of greater than 500 are realized with a pumping power of 3.28 W at 1018 nm. Furthermore, we complete frequency conversion of the classical polarization state by means of a symmetric optical setup based on the fabricated waveguide, and the process fidelity of the conversion is (96.13 +/- 0.021)%. This converter paves the way for constructing a hybrid quantum network and realizing a quantum router in the ultraviolet band in the future.

TI Realization of the iSWAP-like gate among the superconducting qutrits
SO CHINESE PHYSICS B
AB High-dimensional quantum systems, such as qutrits (quantum three-level systems), have multiple accessible energy levels beyond the two-level qubits. Therefore, qutrits can offer a larger state space to improve the efficiency of quantum computation. Here, we demonstrate a high-fidelity iSWAP-like gate operation on a frequency-tunable superconducting qutrits system. The superconducting quantum system consists of two qutrits that are coupled via a resonator with fixed qutrit-resonator coupling strengths. Through designing the frequency pulse profile and optimizing the parameter values, the gate error can be suppressed below 1.5 x 10(-3). To bear out the feasibility of the proposal, we have conducted our study with experimentally accessible parameters. As the resonator can mediate the interaction between the irrelevant qutrits, the presented approach can also be used to couple multiple qutrits together, providing a good platform for quantum information processing.

AB The possibility of integrating quantum computation in a traditional system appears to be a viable route to drastically improve the performance of systems endowed with artificial intelligence. An example of such processing consists of implementing a teleo-reactive system employing quantum computing. In this work, we considered the navigation of a robot in an environment where its decisions are drawn from a quantum algorithm. In particular, the behavior of a robot is formalized through a production system. It is used to describe the world, the actions it can perform, and the conditions of the robot's behavior. According to the production rules, the planning of the robot activities is processed in a recognize-act cycle with a quantum rule processing algorithm. Such a system aims to achieve a significant computational speed-up.

TI Indefinite causal key distribution
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICS A-MATHEMATICAL AND THEORETICAL
AB We propose a quantum key distribution (QKD) protocol that is carried out in an indefinite causal order (ICO). In QKD, one considers a setup in which two parties, Alice and Bob, share a key with one another in such a way that they can detect whether an eavesdropper, Eve, has learnt anything about the key. To our knowledge, in all QKD protocols proposed until now, Eve is detected by publicly comparing a subset of Alice and Bob's key and checking for errors. We find that a consequence of our protocol is that it is possible to detect eavesdroppers without publicly comparing any information about the key. Indeed, we prove that it is not possible for eavesdroppers, performing any individual attack, to extract useful information about the shared key without inducing a nonzero probability of being detected. We also prove the security of this protocol against a class of individual eavesdropping attacks. The role ICO plays in causing unusual phenomena in quantum technologies is an important question. By considering it we find a two-way QKD protocol that exhibits a similar private detection feature, albeit with some interesting differences. After noting some implications of these differences and discussing some of the practicalities of our protocol, we conclude that this work is best considered as a first step in applying quantum cryptographic ideas in an ICO.

TI Optical tomography dynamics induced by qubit-resonator interaction under
   intrinsic decoherence
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB A superconducting circuit with a qubit and a resonator coupled via a two-photon interaction is considered. When the resonator is initially in a superposition of coherent states, optical tomography and quantum coherence dynamics are examined in the context of intrinsic decoherence. The results reveal that optical tomography is a good quantifier of the quantum coherence produced by the qubit-resonator interaction. The effects of qubit-resonator detuning and intrinsic decoherence on the dynamics of optical tomography distributions for coherent and even coherent states are investigated. The dynamics of optical tomography distributions are highly dependent on detuning and intrinsic decoherence. Our numerical simulations reveal that there is a relation between the optical tomography and the generated quantum coherence. When the qubit-resonator detuning and intrinsic decoherence are augmented, the amplitude and intensity, as well as the structure of the optical tomography, change substantially.

AB In the Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) era, using variational quantum algorithms (VQAs) to solve optimization problems has become a key application. However, these algorithms face significant challenges, such as choosing an effective initial set of parameters and the limited quantum processing time that restricts the number of optimization iterations. In this study, we introduce a new framework for optimizing parameterized quantum circuits (PQCs) that employs a classical optimizer, inspired by Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning (MAML) technique. This approach aim to achieve better parameter initialization that ensures fast convergence. Our framework features a classical neural network, called Learner, which interacts with a PQC using the output of Learner as an initial parameter. During the pre-training phase, Learner is trained with a meta-objective based on the quantum circuit cost function. In the adaptation phase, the framework requires only a few PQC updates to converge to a more accurate value, while the learner remains unchanged. This method is highly adaptable and is effectively extended to various Hamiltonian optimization problems. We validate our approach through experiments, including distribution function mapping and optimization of the Heisenberg XYZ Hamiltonian. The result implies that the Learner successfully estimates initial parameters that generalize across the problem space, enabling fast adaptation.

TI Reducing the error rate of a superconducting logical qubit using analog
   readout information
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW APPLIED
AB Quantum error correction enables the preservation of logical qubits with a lower logical error rate than the physical error rate, with performance depending on the decoding method. Traditional decoding approaches rely on the binarization ("hardening") of readout data, thereby ignoring valuable information embedded in the analog ("soft") readout signal. We present experimental results showcasing the advantages of incorporating soft information into the decoding process of a distance-3 (d = 3) bit-flip surface code with flux-tunable transmons. We encode each of the 16 computational states that make up the logical state C0L), and protect them against bit-flip errors by performing repeated Z-basis stabilizer measurements. To infer the logical fidelity for the C0L) state, we average across the 16 computational states and employ two decoding strategies: minimum-weight perfect matching and a recurrent neural network. Our results show a reduction of up to 6.8% in the extracted logical error rate with the use of soft information. Decoding with soft information is widely applicable, independent of the physical qubit platform, and could allow for shorter readout durations, further minimizing logical error rates.

TI The integer multiplier with two unchanged operands reducing T and CNOT
   gates
SO EPJ QUANTUM TECHNOLOGY
AB Quantum circuits for multiplication are necessary for scientific computing on quantum computers. Clifford + T circuits are widely used in fault-tolerant implementations. The costs of implementing T and double-qubit gates are higher than those of other one-qubit gates in the Clifford + T group. In addition, the small number of qubits available in existing quantum devices is another constraint on quantum circuits. Therefore, we reduce T and CNOT gates and circuit width as the primary optimization goal in this paper. We propose an algorithm for multiplication with two unchanged operands. Preserving both operands of the multiplication is important for realizing some quantum algorithms, such as quantum bilinear interpolation. Using this algorithm, we design the circuit of the integer multiplier with two unchanged operands reducing CNOT gates. Next, we develop a Clifford + T circuit for the multiplier and introduce new optimization rules to reduce T gates. Comparative analysis shows that the proposed multiplier achieves the best width among existing multipliers. Compared to multipliers with two unchanged operands that use at most one ancillary qubit, our proposed multiplier has the best T-count, T-depth, and CNOT-count.

TI Shortcuts to adiabaticity in superconducting circuits for fast
   multi-partite state generation
SO COMMUNICATIONS PHYSICS
AB Shortcuts to adiabaticity provide a flexible method to accelerate and improve a quantum control task beyond adiabatic criteria. However, their application to the fast generation of multi-partite quantum gates is still not optimized. Here we propose the reverse-engineering approach to design the longitudinal coupling between a set of qubits coupled to several field modes, for achieving a fast generation of multi-partite quantum gates in photonic or qubit-based architecture. We show that the enhancing generation time is at the nanosecond scale that does not scale with the number of system components. In addition, our protocol does not suffer noticeable detrimental effects due to the dissipative dynamics. Finally, the possible implementation is discussed with the state-of-the-art circuit quantum electrodynamics architecture.
   Fast generation of multi-partite state is highly desirable in quantum information processing. By building on shortcut to adiabaticity, the authors accelerate the generation of multi-partite entangled states via reverse engineering, opening a route towards designing efficient quantum control protocols for circuit quantum electrodynamics architectures.

TI Integrated quantum polariton interferometry
SO COMMUNICATIONS PHYSICS
AB Recently, observation of low-density polaritons in the quantum regime has prompted interest beyond their collective behavior. Here, an integrated quantum logic device that relies on two-body polaritonic interaction is proposed theoretically.
   Exciton-polaritons are hybrid radiation-matter elementary excitations that, thanks to their strong nonlinearities, enable a plethora of physical phenomena ranging from room temperature condensation to superfluidity. While polaritons are usually exploited in a high-density regime, evidence for quantum correlations at the level of few excitations has been recently reported, thus suggesting the possibility of using these systems for quantum information purposes. Here we show that integrated circuits of propagating single polaritons can be arranged to build deterministic quantum logic gates in which the two-particle interaction energy plays a crucial role. Besides showing their prospective potential for photonic quantum computation, we also show that these systems can be exploited for metrology purposes, as for instance to precisely measure the magnitude of the polariton-polariton interaction at the two-body level. Our results will motivate the development of practical quantum polaritonic devices in prospective quantum technologies.

TI Quantum Computing for High-Energy Physics: State of the Art and
   Challenges
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB Quantum computers offer an intriguing path for a paradigmatic change of computing in the natural sciences and beyond, with the potential for achieving a so-called quantum advantage-namely, a significant (in some cases exponential) speedup of numerical simulations. The rapid development of hardware devices with various realizations of qubits enables the execution of small-scale but representative applications on quantum computers. In particular, the high-energy physics community plays a pivotal role in accessing the power of quantum computing, since the field is a driving source for challenging computational problems. This concerns, on the theoretical side, the exploration of models that are very hard or even impossible to address with classical techniques and, on the experimental side, the enormous data challenge of newly emerging experiments, such as the upgrade of the Large Hadron Collider. In this Roadmap paper, led by CERN, DESY, and IBM, we provide the status of high-energy physics quantum computations and give examples of theoretical and experimental target benchmark applications, which can be addressed in the near future. Having in mind hardware with about 100 qubits capable of executing several thousand two-qubit gates, where possible, we also provide resource estimates for the examples given using error-mitigated quantum computing. The ultimate declared goal of this task force is therefore to trigger further research in the high-energy physics community to develop interesting use cases for demonstrations on near-term quantum computers.

TI Quantum interference of identical photons from remote GaAs quantum dots
SO NATURE NANOTECHNOLOGY
AB Photonic quantum technology provides a viable route to quantum communication(1,2), quantum simulation(3) and quantum information processing(4). Recent progress has seen the realization of boson sampling using 20 single photons(3) and quantum key distribution over hundreds of kilometres(2). Scaling the complexity requires architectures containing multiple photon sources, photon counters and a large number of indistinguishable single photons. Semiconductor quantum dots are bright and fast sources of coherent single photons(5-9). For applications, a roadblock is the poor quantum coherence on interfering single photons created by independent quantum dots(10,11). Here we demonstrate two-photon interference with near-unity visibility (93.0 +/- 0.8)% using photons from two completely separate GaAs quantum dots. The experiment retains all the emission into the zero phonon line-only the weak phonon sideband is rejected; temporal post-selection is not employed. By exploiting quantum interference, we demonstrate a photonic controlled-not circuit and an entanglement with fidelity of (85.0 +/- 1.0)% between photons of different origins. The two-photon interference visibility is high enough that the entanglement fidelity is well above the classical threshold. The high mutual coherence of the photons stems from high-quality materials, diode structure and relatively large quantum dot size. Our results establish a platform-GaAs quantum dots-for creating coherent single photons in a scalable way.

TI Requirements for fault-tolerant quantum computation with
   cavity-QED-based atom-atom gates mediated by a photon with a finite
   pulse length
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB We analyze the requirements for fault-tolerant quantum computation with atom-atom gates based on cavity quantum electrodynamics (cQED) mediated by a photon with a finite pulse length. For short photon pulses, the distorted shape of the reflected pulses from the cQED system is a serious error source. In the previous study by Goto and Ichimura [Phys. Rev. A 82, 032311 (2010)], only the photon loss is minimized without considering the shape distortion to optimize the system parameters. Here we show an improved optimization method to minimize the infidelity due to the shape distortion and the photon losses in a well-balanced manner for the fault-tolerant scheme using probabilistic gates [Phys. Rev. A 80, 040303(R) (2009)]. Under this optimization, we discuss the fault-tolerant quantum computing requirement for short pulses. Finally, we show that reducing the cavity length is an effective way to reduce the errors of this type of gate in the case of short photon pulses.

TI Variational Quantum Algorithms for the Allocation of Resources in a
   Cloud/Edge Architecture
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON QUANTUM ENGINEERING
AB Modern cloud/edge architectures need to orchestrate multiple layers of heterogeneous computing nodes, including pervasive sensors/actuators, distributed edge/fog nodes, centralized data centers, and quantum devices. The optimal assignment and scheduling of computation on the different nodes is a very difficult problem, with NP-hard complexity. In this article, we explore the possibility of solving this problem with variational quantum algorithms, which can become a viable alternative to classical algorithms in the near future. In particular, we compare the performance, in terms of success probability, of two algorithms, i.e., quantum approximate optimization algorithm and variational quantum eigensolver (VQE). The simulation experiments, performed for a set of simple problems, show that the VQE algorithm ensures better performance when it is equipped with appropriate circuit ansatzes that are able to restrict the search space. Moreover, experiments executed on real quantum hardware show that the execution time, when increasing the size of the problem, grows much more slowly than the trend obtained with classical computation, which is known to be exponential.

TI Variational Quantum Circuit Topology Grid Search for Hypocalcemia
   Following Thyroid Surgery
SO MATHEMATICS
AB Quantum computing's potential to revolutionise medical applications has spurred interest in leveraging quantum algorithms for healthcare challenges. In this research, the authors explored the application of variational quantum circuits to predicting hypocalcemia risk following thyroid surgery. Hypocalcemia, resulting from hypoparathyroidism, is a common post-surgical complication. This novel approach includes a topology grid search of the variational quantum circuits. To execute the grid search, our research employed a classical optimiser that guided the adjustment of different circuit topologies, assessing their impact on predictive performance. Our research used, as relevant features, an intra-operative PTH (parathyroid hormone) at 10 min post-removal and percentage decrease of pre-operative and intra-operative PTH levels. The findings revealed insights into the interplay between variational quantum circuit topologies and predictive accuracy for hypocalcemia risk assessment.

TI Magnetic field imaging by hBN quantum sensor nanoarray
SO APPLIED PHYSICS LETTERS
AB Placing a sensor close to the target at the nano-level is a central challenge in quantum sensing. We demonstrate magnetic field imaging with a boron vacancy (V-B(-)) defects array in hexagonal boron nitride with a few 10 nm thickness. V-B(-) sensor spots with a size of (100 nm)(2) are arranged periodically with nanoscale accuracy using a helium ion microscope and attached tightly to a gold wire. The sensor array allows us to visualize the magnetic field induced by the current in the straight micro wire with a high spatial resolution. Each sensor exhibits a practical sensitivity of 73.6 mu T/Hz(0.5), suitable for quantum materials research. Our technique of arranging V-B(-) quantum sensors periodically and tightly on measurement targets will maximize their potential.

TI Designing Codes around Interactions: The Case of a Spin
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB I present a new approach for designing quantum error-correcting codes guaranteeing a physically natural implementation of Clifford operations. Inspired by the scheme put forward by Gottesman, Kitaev, and Preskill for encoding a qubit in an oscillator in which Clifford operations may be performed via Gaussian unitaries, this approach yields new schemes for encoding a qubit in a large spin in which single-qubit Clifford operations may be performed via spatial rotations. I construct all possible examples of such codes, provide universal-gate-set implementations using quadratic angular-momentum Hamiltonians, and derive criteria for when these codes exactly correct physically relevant errors.

TI Random projection using random quantum circuits
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB The random sampling task performed by Google's Sycamore processor gave us a glimpse of the "quantum supremacy era." This has definitely shed some light on the power of random quantum circuits in this abstract task of sampling outputs from the (pseudo)random circuits. In this paper, we explore a practical near-term use of local random quantum circuits in dimensional reduction of large low-rank data sets. We make use of the well-studied dimensionality reduction technique called the random projection method. This method has been extensively used in various applications such as image processing, logistic regression, entropy computation of low-rank matrices, etc. We prove that the matrix representations of local random quantum circuits with sufficiently shorter depths [similar to O(n)] serve as good candidates for random projection. We demonstrate numerically that their projection abilities are not far off from the computationally expensive classical principal components analysis on MNIST and CIFAR-100 image datasets. We also benchmark the performance of quantum random projection against the commonly used classical random projection in the tasks of dimensionality reduction of image data sets and computing von Neumann entropies of large low-rank density matrices. And finally, using variational quantum singular value decomposition, we demonstrate a near-term implementation of extracting the singular vectors with dominant singular values after quantum random projecting a large low-rank matrix to lower dimensions. All such numerical experiments unequivocally demonstrate the ability of local random circuits to randomize a large Hilbert space at sufficiently shorter depths with robust retention of properties of large data sets in reduced dimensions.

TI 10 GHz robust polarization modulation towards high-speed satellite-based
   quantum communication
SO EPJ QUANTUM TECHNOLOGY
AB In practical satellite-based quantum key distribution (QKD) systems, the preparation and transmission of polarization-encoding photons suffer from complex environmental effects and high channel loss. Consequently, the hinge to enhancing the secure key rate (SKR) lies in achieving robust, low-error, and high-speed polarization modulation. Although the schemes that enable self-compensation demonstrate remarkable robustness, their modulation speed is limited to around 2 GHz to prevent the interaction between the electrical signal and the reverse optical pulses. Here, we utilize the non-reciprocity of the lithium niobate modulators and eliminate the modulation on the reverse optical pulses. This characteristic is widely available in the radio-frequency band, allowing the modulation speed to no longer be limited by the self-compensating optics and enabling further increases. The measured average intrinsic quantum bit error rate of the four polarization states at 10 GHz system repetition frequency is as low as 0.53% over 10 min without any compensation. The simulation results show that our scheme can maintain a SKR of about 5 kbps even at the extreme communication distances between the satellite and the earth. Our work can be efficiently applied in high-speed, high-loss satellite-based quantum communication scenarios.

TI Anomalous quantum information scrambling for Z3 parafermion
   chains
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
AB Parafermions are exotic quasiparticles with non-Abelian fractional statistics that could be exploited to realize universal topological quantum computing. Here, we study the scrambling of quantum information in one-dimensional parafermionic chains, with a focus on Z(3) parafermions in particular. We use the generalized out-of-time-ordered correlators (OTOCs) as a measure of the information scrambling and introduce an efficient method based on matrix product operators to compute them. With this method, we compute the OTOCs for Z(3) parafermions chains up to 200 sites for the entire early growth region. We find that, in stark contrast to the dynamics of conventional fermions or bosons, the information scrambling light cones for parafermions can be both symmetric and asymmetric, even for inversion-invariant Hamiltonians involving only hopping terms. In addition, we find a deformed light cone structure with a sharp peak at the boundary of the parafermion chains in the topological regime, which gives unambiguous evidence of the strong zero modes at infinite temperature.

SO ADVANCED QUANTUM TECHNOLOGIES
AB Quantum Machine Learning (QML) leverages the transformative power of quantum computing to explore a broad range of applications, including optimization, data analysis, and complex problem-solving. Central to this study is the using of an innovative intrusion detection system leveraging QML models, with a preference for Quantum Neural Network (QNN) architectures for classification tasks. The inherent advantages of QNNs, notably their parallel processing capabilities facilitated by quantum computers and the exploitation of quantum superposition and parallelism, are elucidated. These attributes empower QNNs to execute certain classification tasks expediently and with heightened efficiency. Empirical validation is conducted through the deployment and testing of a QNN-based intrusion detection system, employing a subset of the CIC-DDoS 2019 dataset. Notably, despite employing a reduced feature set, the QNN-based system exhibits remarkable classification accuracy, achieving a commendable rate of 92.63%. Moreover, the study advocates for the utilization of quantum computing libraries such as Qiskit, facilitating QNN training on local machines or quantum simulators. The findings underscore the efficacy of a QNN-based intrusion detection system in attaining superior classification accuracy when confronted with large-scale training datasets. However, it is imperative to acknowledge the constraints imposed by the limited number of qubits available on local machines and simulators.

Based on invariantbased reverse engineering, we present a general scheme for implementing robust population transfer in a three-level system via optimal shortcut to adiabatic passage. The systematic error sensitivity is introduced to measure the robustness of the process. The smooth Rabi frequencies are expressed with some coefficients, which are also related to the systematic error sensitivity and the population of intermediate state. When the amplitude of control field is given, the transfer can be optimized within as small systematic error sensitivity as possible, i.e., the robustness against systematic errors is further improved by choosing suitable correlation coefficient. Additionally, we apply the technique to achieve robust excitation fluctuation transfer between two membranes in an optomechanical system. The relation between the fidelity of excitation fluctuation transfer and variation of effective optomechanical coupling strengths is analysed. Numerical result shows that the fidelity keeps over 0.95 even if the coupling strengths deviates from 20% of the theoretical value. Moreover, comparison with existing literature [Opt. Express 29, 7998 (2021)], the proposed scheme possesses stronger robustness against variations of effective optomechanical coupling strengths and lower population of unwanted states. The idea may provide a promising approach for quantum information processing.

TI Entanglement distribution in lossy quantum networks
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB Entanglement distribution is essential for unlocking the potential of distributed quantum information processing. We consider an N-partite network where entanglement is distributed via a central source over lossy channels, and network participants cooperate to establish entanglement between any two chosen parties under local operations and classical communication (LOCC). We develop a general mathematical framework to assess the average bipartite entanglement shared in a lossy distribution, and introduce a tractable lower bound by optimizing over a subset of single-parameter LOCC transformations. Our results show that probabilistically extracting Bell pairs from W states is more advantageous than deterministically extracting them from GHZ-like states in lossy networks, with this advantage increasing with network size. We further extend our analysis analytically, proving that W states remain more effective in large-scale networks. These findings offer valuable insights into the practical deployment of near-term networks, and corroborate a trade-off relationship between the success conversion probability of entanglement distribution protocols and their robustness to loss.

TI Rice Yield Forecasting Using Hybrid Quantum Deep Learning Model
SO COMPUTERS
AB In recent advancements in agricultural technology, quantum mechanics and deep learning integration have shown promising potential to revolutionize rice yield forecasting methods. This research introduces a novel Hybrid Quantum Deep Learning model that leverages the intricate processing capabilities of quantum computing combined with the robust pattern recognition prowess of deep learning algorithms such as Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) and Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (Bi-LSTM). Bi-LSTM networks are used for temporal feature extraction and quantum circuits for quantum feature processing. Quantum circuits leverage quantum superposition and entanglement to enhance data representation by capturing intricate feature interactions. These enriched quantum features are combined with the temporal features extracted by Bi-LSTM and fed into an XGBoost regressor. By synthesizing quantum feature processing and classical machine learning techniques, our model aims to improve prediction accuracy significantly. Based on measurements of mean square error (MSE), the coefficient of determination (R2), and mean average error (MAE), the results are 1.191621 x 10-5, 0.999929482, and 0.001392724, respectively. This value is so close to perfect that it helps make essential decisions in global agricultural planning and management.

   criticality
SO COMMUNICATIONS PHYSICS
AB Microwave photon detection is a key technology for low-temperature superconducting electronics and quantum information processing. A promising possibility is to use switching processes in parametric superconducting devices at criticality, which can be triggered by small perturbations. Here we demonstrate the unique sensing properties of the superconducting Kerr parametric resonator when operated in the proximity of the phase transition boundary. We utilize a semiclassical approximation to provide numerical and analytical results for the Heisenberg-Langevin and Fokker-Planck equations that describe the switching mechanism. We show that the probability of switching events is enhanced by probe input states with energies down to single quanta levels.

TI Quantum-Enhanced Blockchain: A Secure and Practical Blockchain Scheme
SO CMC-COMPUTERS MATERIALS & CONTINUA
AB The rapid advancement of quantum technology poses significant security risks to blockchain systems. However, quantum technology can also provide solutions for enhancing blockchain security. In this paper, we propose a quantum-enhanced blockchain scheme to achieve a high level of security against quantum computing attacks. We first discuss quantum computing attacks on classic blockchains, including attacks on hash functions, digital signatures, and consensus mechanisms. We then introduce quantum technologies, such as a quantum hash function (QHF), a quantum digital signature (QDS), and proof of authority (PoA) consensus mechanism, into our scheme to improve the security of the blockchain system. Our security analysis demonstrates that our scheme offers superior security against quantum and classic attacks. Finally, we compare our scheme with previous works, showing that our scheme has achieved a perfect balance in terms of practicality, reliability, scalability, and efficiency. Overall, this work contributes to the ongoing research on quantum blockchain in the quantum era.

TI Guarding security of quantum key distribution using blind calibration
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB Quantum key distribution (QKD) has emerged as a leading quantum technology for secure key exchange, achieving notable advancements in both theoretical and experimental domains. Despite these successes, practical QKD systems remain vulnerable to security risks due to device calibration. In this study, we propose a revised blind calibration scheme that incorporates mixed states with concealed information, safeguarding the calibration process from eavesdropping, thereby enhancing the security of the detector calibration and reference frame calibration processes. Furthermore, we introduce a gradient algorithm to dynamically adjust the activation time of the gated single-photon detectors, maintaining the maximum detection efficiency while monitoring whether the calibration process is subjected to quantum man-in-the-middle attack. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach reduces the quantum bit error rate from 50% to 1.5% over transmission distances of 50, 100, and 150 km. This enhanced calibration method improves the practical security of QKD and supports the large-scale deployment of QKD systems.

TI Cavity-mode initialization via a Rabi-driven qubit
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW APPLIED
AB Microwave cavity modes with long coherence times are used in many different quantum computing systems. During normal operation of such systems, these modes, called "memory modes," often need to be set to different coherent photonic occupations. In this work we present a technique we call "Rabi-driven reset" in which the state of a memory mode is transferred into a decaying mode. This is done through a Rabi-driven qubit that is coupled to both modes via sideband driving tones. The outcome of the method is the initialization of the memory mode in any required coherent state. Simulations are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of this technique, along with a comparison to an existing coupling method. Our simulations predict a decrease of an order of magnitude in initialization times compared with existing methods.

AB Quantum application development typically involves verifying the construction procedures of quantum applications with a few qubits and running them on actual quantum computers based on the verified procedures. However, existing verification techniques face practical issues, such as the need for human intervention, long verification times, and insufficient descriptions. This study introduces a practical Design by Contract framework for quantum applications, designed for testing and debugging quantum applications on simulators. It allows for writing assertions about the input and output states of quantum circuits constructed by certain procedures and the post-processing of measurement results. The quantum application can be verified quickly by checking these assertions in test cases on simulators. Our framework introduces practical mechanisms for quantum application development. It separates the construction procedure of a quantum application and its assertions through parameter distinction, introduces an evaluation rule for early precondition checking, and reduces assertion-writing effort through assertion reuse mechanisms for inverting quantum circuits and using quantum circuits for qubits in a superposition state. We validated our framework through experiments and surveyed industry quantum computer researchers to assess its effectiveness.

AB Network verification, broadly defined as proving the correctness of certain properties resulting from a network's configuration, cannot be efficiently solved on classical hardware via brute force. Prior work has developed a variety of methods that scale by observing a structure in the search space and then evaluating classes induced by that structure. However, even these classification mechanisms have their limitations. In this paper, we consider a radically different approach: applying quantum computing to more efficiently solve network verification problems. We provide an overview of how to map variants of verification problems into unstructured search problems that can be solved via quantum computing with quadratic speedup, making the approach feasible in theory to problems that twice as big in the size of the input. Emerging quantum systems cannot yet tackle problems of practical interest, but rapid advances in hardware and algorithm development make now a great time to start thinking about their application. With this in mind, we explore the limits of scale of the problem for which quantum computing can solve network verification problems as unstructured search.

Herein we report the synthesis of a molecular multi-qubit model system with three individually addressable, weakly interacting, spin 1/2 ${{ 1/2 }}$ centres of differing g-values. We use pulsed Electron Paramagnetic Resonance (EPR) techniques to characterise and separately address the individual electron spin qubits; Cu-II, Cr7Ni ring and a nitroxide, to determine the strength of the inter-qubit dipolar interaction. Orientation selective Relaxation-Induced Dipolar Modulation Enhancement (os-RIDME) detecting across the Cu-II spectrum revealed a strongly correlated Cu-II-Cr7Ni ring relationship; detecting on the nitroxide resonance measured both the nitroxide and Cu-II or nitroxide and Cr7Ni ring correlations, with switchability of the interaction based on differing relaxation dynamics, indicating a handle for implementing EPR-based quantum information processing (QIP) algorithms.

TI Multipartite entanglement versus nonlocality for two families of
   N-qubit states
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Entangled states of multiple qubits can violate Bell-type inequalities indicating nonlocal behavior of multiqubit quantum correlations. We analyze the relation between multipartite entanglement and genuine multipartite nonlocality, characterized by Svetlichny inequality violations, for two families of N-qubit states. We show that for the generalized Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger family of states, Svetlichny inequality is not violated when the n-tangle is less than 1/2 for any even number of qubits. On the other hand, the maximal slice states always violate the Svetlichny inequality when n-tangle is nonzero, and the violation increases monotonically with tangle. Our work generalizes the relations between tangle and Svetlichny inequality violations previously derived for three qubits.

TI The Use of Exchange Coupled Atom Qubits as Atomic-Scale Magnetic Field
   Sensors
SO ADVANCED MATERIALS
AB Phosphorus atoms in silicon offer a rich quantum computing platform where both nuclear and electron spins can be used to store and process quantum information. While individual control of electron and nuclear spins has been demonstrated, the interplay between them during qubit operations has been largely unexplored. This study investigates the use of exchange-based operation between donor bound electron spins to probe the local magnetic fields experienced by the qubits with exquisite precision at the atomic scale. To achieve this, coherent exchange oscillations are performed between two electron spin qubits, where the left and right qubits are hosted by three and two phosphorus donors, respectively. The frequency spectrum of exchange oscillations shows quantized changes in the local magnetic fields at the qubit sites, corresponding to the different hyperfine coupling between the electron and each of the qubit-hosting nuclear spins. This ability to sense the hyperfine fields of individual nuclear spins using the exchange interaction constitutes a unique metrology technique, which reveals the exact crystallographic arrangements of the phosphorus atoms in the silicon crystal for each qubit. The detailed knowledge obtained of the local magnetic environment can then be used to engineer hyperfine fields in multi-donor qubits for high-fidelity two-qubit gates.

TI Scattering amplitude from quantum computing with reduction formula
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW D
AB Utilizing the Lehmann-Symanzik-Zimmermann reduction formula, we present a new general framework for computing scattering amplitudes in quantum field theory with quantum computers in a fully nonperturbative way. In this framework, one only has to construct one -particle states of zero momentum, and no wave packets of incoming particles are needed. The framework is able to incorporate scatterings of bound states, and is ideal for scatterings involving a small number of particles. We expect this framework to have particular advantages when applied to exclusive hadron scatterings. As a proof of concept, by simulations on classical hardware, we demonstrate that in the one -flavor Gross-Neveu model, the fermion propagator, the connected fermion four -point function, and the propagator of a fermion-antifermion bound state obtained from our proposed quantum algorithm have the desired pole structure crucial to the implementation of the Lehmann-Symanzik-Zimmermann reduction formula.

TI Analog Quantum Simulation of Non-Condon Effects in Molecular
   Spectroscopy
SO ACS PHOTONICS
AB In this work, we present a linear optical implementation for analog quantum simulation of molecular vibronic spectra, incorporating the non-Condon scattering operation with a quadratically small truncation error. To date, analog and digital quantum algorithms for achieving quantum speedup have been suggested only in the Condon regime, which refers to a transition dipole moment that is independent of nuclear coordinates. For analog quantum optical simulation beyond the Condon regime (i.e., non-Condon transitions), the resulting nonunitary scattering operations must be handled appropriately in a linear optical network. In this paper, we consider the first- and second-order Herzberg-Teller expansions of the transition dipole moment operator for the non-Condon effect for implementation on linear optical quantum hardware. We believe that the method opens a new way to approximate arbitrary nonunitary operations in analog and digital quantum simulations. We report in silico simulations of the vibronic spectra for naphthalene, phenanthrene, and benzene to support our findings.

The main challenge is that the strong coupling and readout signal used to probe the quantum state may also introduce additional channels which may cause qubit state transitions. Here, we design a novel architecture to implement the long-sought longitudinal interaction scheme between qubits and resonators. This architecture not only provides genuine longitudinal interaction by eliminating residual transversal couplings, but also introduces proper nonlinearity to the resonator that can further minimize decay error and measurement-induced excitation error. Combined with the multilevel readout protocol, we achieved a measurement fidelity of 99.8% in 202 ns without requiring any first-stage amplification. This highlights its potential as a highly promising architecture for superconducting qubit measurement.

AB Frequency-bin encoding is massively parallelizable and robust for optical fiber transmission. When coupled with an additional degree of freedom (DoF), the expansion of the Hilbert space allows for deterministic controlled operations between two DoFs within a single photon. Such capabilities, when combined with photonic hyperentanglement, are of great value for quantum communication protocols, including dense coding and single-copy entanglement distillation. In this talk, we present an all-fiber-coupled, ultrabroadband polarization-frequency hyperentangled source and conduct comprehensive quantum state tomography across multiple dense wavelength division multiplexing channels spanning the optical C+L-band (1530-1625 nm). In addition, we design and implement a high-fidelity controlled-NOT (cnot) operation between polarization and frequency DoFs by exploiting electro-optic phase modulation within a fiber Sagnac loop. Collectively, our hyperentangled source and two-qubit gate should unlock new opportunities for harnessing polarization-frequency resources in established telecommunication fiber networks for future quantum applications.

TI A Multiscale Simulation Approach for Germanium-Hole-Based Quantum
   Processor
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON COMPUTER-AIDED DESIGN OF INTEGRATED CIRCUITS AND
   SYSTEMS
AB A multiscale simulation method is developed to model a quantum dot (QD) array of germanium (Ge) holes for quantum computing. Guided by 3-D numerical quantum device simulations of QD structures, an analytical model of the tunnel coupling between the neighboring hole QDs is obtained. Two-qubit entangling quantum gate operations and quantum circuit characteristics of the QD array processor are then modeled. A device analysis of two-qubit Ge hole quantum gates demonstrates faster gate speed, smaller process variability, and less stringent requirement of feature size, compared to its silicon counterpart. The multiscale simulation method allows the assessment of the quantum processor circuit performance from a bottom-up, physics-informed perspective. The application of the simulation method to the Ge QD array processor indicates its promising potential for preparing high-fidelity ansatz states in quantum chemistry simulations.

TI Polarization-path-frequency entanglement using interferometry and
   frequency shifters
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICS B-ATOMIC MOLECULAR AND OPTICAL PHYSICS
AB Higher dimensional Hilbert space along with ability to control multiple degrees of freedom of photon and entangle them has enabled new quantum protocols for various quantum information processing applications. Here, we propose a scheme to generate and control polarization-path-frequency entanglement using the operative elements required to implement a polarization-controlled quantum walk in the path (position) space and frequency domain. Hyperentangled states manifests in the controlled dynamics using an interferometric setup where half-wave plates, beam-splitters and frequency shifters such as those based on the electro-optic effect are used to manipulate the polarization, path and frequency degrees of freedom respectively. The emphasis is on utilizing the polarization to influence the movement to a specific value in the frequency and position space. Negativity between the subspaces is calculated to demonstrate the controllability of the entanglement between the three degrees of freedom and the effect of noise on the entanglement is modelled using the depolarizing channel. Progress reported with experimental demonstration of realization of quantum walk using quantum states of light makes quantum walks a practical approach to generate hyperentangled states.

TI Single-photon scattering and quantum entanglement of two giant atoms
   with azimuthal angle differences in a waveguide system
SO CHINESE PHYSICS B
AB We theoretically investigate coherent scattering of single photons and quantum entanglement of two giant atoms with azimuthal angle differences in a waveguide system. Using the real-space Hamiltonian, analytical expressions are derived for the transport spectra scattered by these two giant atoms with four azimuthal angles. Fano-like resonance can be exhibited in the scattering spectra by adjusting the azimuthal angle difference. High concurrence of the entangled state for two atoms can be implemented in a wide angle-difference range, and the entanglement of the atomic states can be switched on/off by modulating the additional azimuthal angle differences from the giant atoms. This suggests a novel handle to effectively control the single-photon scattering and quantum entanglement.

TI High-Capacity Quantum Private Comparison Protocol With Six-Qubit
   Hyperentangled Bell States and Hypercoding
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB Based on the two-photon six-qubit hyperentangled Bell states and hyper-coding, a new high-capacity quantum privacy comparison (QPC) protocol is proposed to realize a high utilization of quantum resources. The protocol enables two particles of hyperentangled Bell states to compare the equality of 6 classical bits of secret information between two quantum users. The unitary operations are used to encode the secret information and achieve dense coding. In the proposed protocol, decoy photons and the quantum uncertainty principle are used to ensure transmission channel security and particle security. comparisons with other QPC protocols in terms of quantum resources and efficiency reveal that the proposed protocol has significant advantages in quantum efficiency.

TI Generation of multipartite entanglement between spin-1 particles with
   bifurcation-based quantum annealing
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB Quantum annealing is a way to solve a combinational optimization problem where quantum fluctuation is induced by transverse fields. Recently, a bifurcation-based quantum annealing with spin-1 particles was suggested as another mechanism to implement the quantum annealing. In the bifurcation-based quantum annealing, each spin is initially prepared in vertical bar 0 >, let this state evolve by a time-dependent Hamiltonian in an adiabatic way, and we find a state spanned by vertical bar +/- 1 > at the end of the evolution. Here, we propose a scheme to generate multipartite entanglement, namely GHZ states, between spin-1 particles by using the bifurcation-based quantum annealing. We gradually decrease the detuning of the spin-1 particles while we adiabatically change the amplitude of the external driving fields. Due to the dipole-dipole interactions between the spin-1 particles, we can prepare the GHZ state after performing this protocol. We discuss possible implementations of our scheme by using nitrogen vacancy centers in diamond.

TI Active Leakage Cancellation in Single Qubit Gates
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB The ability to perform fast and accurate rotations between the computational basis states of quantum bits is one of the most fundamental requirements for building a quantum computer. Because physical qubits generally contain more than two levels, faster gates often result in a higher leakage rate outside of the computational space. In this Letter, we enhance the state-of-the-art single qubit gate by introducing active leakage cancellation. This is accomplished via a second drive tone near the leakage transition such that we cancel the leakage caused by the main drive. Furthermore, we describe a measurement sequence that can be used to calibrate the parameters of this leakage cancellation drive. Finally, we apply the technique to superconducting transmon qubits and achieve leakage suppression by up to a factor of 20 when compared to pulses shaped with the standard derivative removal by adiabatic gate technique. This results in a coherence-limited gate infidelity of 7.5 x 10-5 with leakage below 10-5 level, for a 10 ns pi/2 gate and 196 MHz qubit anharmonicity.

TI Testing quantum computers with the protocol of quantum state matching
SO PHYSICA SCRIPTA
AB The presence of noise in quantum computers hinders their effective operation. Even though quantum error correction can theoretically remedy this problem, its practical realization is still a challenge. Testing and benchmarking noisy, intermediate-scale quantum (NISC) computers is therefore of high importance. Here, we suggest the application of the so-called quantum state matching protocol for testing purposes. This protocol was originally proposed to determine if an unknown quantum state falls in a prescribed neighborhood of a reference state. We decompose the unitary specific to the protocol and construct the quantum circuit implementing one step of the dynamics for different characteristic parameters of the scheme and present test results for two different IBM quantum computers. By comparing the experimentally obtained relative frequencies of success to the ideal success probability with a maximum statistical tolerance, we discriminate statistical errors from device specific ones. For the characterization of noise, we also use the fact that while the output of the ideal protocol is insensitive to the internal phase of the input state, the actual implementation may lead to deviations. For systematically varied inputs we find that the device with the smaller quantum volume performs better on our tests than the one with larger quantum volume, while for random inputs they show a more similar performance.

TI Experimental measurement-device-independent quantum key distribution
   with flawed state-preparation over 300 km
SO EPJ QUANTUM TECHNOLOGY
AB Quantum key distribution (QKD) promises theoretically secure communication. However, it encounters challenges in implementation security and performance due to inevitable device imperfections. Since the proposal of measurement-device-independent (MDI) QKD, the critical step toward practical security is to secure QKD with imperfect sources. The source imperfections manifest as state-preparation uncertainty (SPU) in various aspects, e.g., encoding uncertainty, intensity fluctuation, and imperfect vacuum states. Here, we perform an MDI-QKD experiment and achieve both high practical security and superior performance. We address the general form of SPU and guarantee a tight estimation of the secret key rate based on the operator dominance method. We achieve secure key distribution over 303.37 km, which not only represents the farthest distance in experiments involving SPU but also considers the most SPU scenarios. Our experimental results represent a significant step toward promoting practical and secure quantum communication.

TI Robust shortcut for controlling Bloch states in optical lattices

AB The ability to manipulate quantum states with robustness is crucial for various quantum applications, including quantum computation, quantum simulation, and quantum precision measurement. While pulsed shortcut techniques have proven effective for controlling bands and orbits in optical lattices, their robustness has not been extensively studied. In this paper, we present an improved shortcut design scheme that retains the advantages of high speed and high fidelity, while ensuring exceptional robustness. We conduct comprehensive experimental verifications to demonstrate the effectiveness of this new robust shortcut and its application in quantum gate design. The proposed scheme is expected to enhance the robustness of optical lattice orbit-based interferometry, quantum gates, and other processes.

TI Assembly of a Coreset of Earth Observation Images on a Small Quantum
   Computer
SO ELECTRONICS
AB Satellite instruments monitor the Earth's surface day and night, and, as a result, the size of Earth observation (EO) data is dramatically increasing. Machine Learning (ML) techniques are employed routinely to analyze and process these big EO data, and one well-known ML technique is a Support Vector Machine (SVM). An SVM poses a quadratic programming problem, and quantum computers including quantum annealers (QA) as well as gate-based quantum computers promise to solve an SVM more efficiently than a conventional computer; training the SVM by employing a quantum computer/conventional computer represents a quantum SVM (qSVM)/classical SVM (cSVM) application. However, quantum computers cannot tackle many practical EO problems by using a qSVM due to their very low number of input qubits. Hence, we assembled a coreset ( "core of a dataset ") of given EO data for training a weighted SVM on a small quantum computer, a D-Wave quantum annealer with around 5000 input quantum bits. The coreset is a small, representative weighted subset of an original dataset, and its performance can be analyzed by using the proposed weighted SVM on a small quantum computer in contrast to the original dataset. As practical data, we use synthetic data, Iris data, a Hyperspectral Image (HSI) of Indian Pine, and a Polarimetric Synthetic Aperture Radar (PolSAR) image of San Francisco. We measured the closeness between an original dataset and its coreset by employing a Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence test, and, in addition, we trained a weighted SVM on our coreset data by using both a D-Wave quantum annealer (D-Wave QA) and a conventional computer. Our findings show that the coreset approximates the original dataset with very small KL divergence (smaller is better), and the weighted qSVM even outperforms the weighted cSVM on the coresets for a few instances of our experiments. As a side result (or a by-product result), we also present our KL divergence findings for demonstrating the closeness between our original data (i.e., our synthetic data, Iris data, hyperspectral image, and PolSAR image) and the assembled coreset.

TI Coherent control of a donor-molecule electron spin qubit in silicon
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Donor spins in silicon provide a promising material platform for large scale quantum computing. Excellent electron spin coherence times of T-2(*) = 268 mu s with fidelities of 99.9% have been demonstrated for isolated phosphorus donors in isotopically pure Si-28, where donors are local-area-implanted in a nanoscale MOS device. Despite robust single qubit gates, realising two-qubit exchange gates using this technique is challenging due to the statistical nature of the dopant implant and placement process. In parallel a precision scanning probe lithography route has been developed to place single donors and donor molecules on one atomic plane of silicon with high accuracy aligned to heavily phosphorus doped silicon in-plane gates. Recent results using this technique have demonstrated a fast (0.8 ns) two-qubit gate with two P donor molecules placed 13 nm apart in Si-nat. In this paper we demonstrate a single qubit gate with coherent oscillations of the electron spin on a P donor molecule in Si-nat patterned by scanning tunneling microscope (STM) lithography. The electron spin exhibits excellent coherence properties, with a T-2 decoherence time of 298 +/- 30 mu s, and T-2(*) dephasing time of 295 +/- 23 ns.

TI Diamond nitrogen-vacancy centres spin-state-based quantum sensor using a
   compact broadband antenna
SO ELECTRONICS LETTERS
AB This paper presents a compact broadband antenna that is used in the spin-state-based magnetic field quantum sensor. In the diamond nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centre system, the qubit resonance is excited by the microwave signal, and the frequency shift is proportional to the external magnetic field strength. Conventional narrow-band antennas or single resonators are not able to match the resonance frequency of the NV centre over a wide bandwidth, resulting in degraded sensitivity and dynamic range of the sensor. Here, the authors designed a compact broadband antenna, which achieves a fractional bandwidth of 71.43% at the Zeeman splitting frequency of 2.87 GHz. With the introduced slot structure on the antenna, a higher microwave near field strength can also be achieved, which improves the magnetic field sensitivity and dynamic range. By applying our design antenna, the experimental results indicate that the NV-based quantum sensor achieves a sensitivity of 3.07 mu T/Hz(1/2) and a dynamic range up to 44.9 dB, which are both greatly improved compared to sensor that uses a conventional antenna.

TI Qubit readout error mitigation with bit-flip averaging
SO SCIENCE ADVANCES
AB Quantum computers are becoming increasingly accessible and may soon outperform classical computers for useful tasks. However, qubit readout errors remain a substantial hurdle to running quantum algorithms on current devices. We present a scheme to more efficiently mitigate these errors on quantum hardware and numerically show that our method consistently gives advantage over previous mitigation schemes. Our scheme removes biases in the readout errors, allowing a general error model to be built with far fewer calibration measurements. Specifically, for reading out n-qubits, we show a factor of 2(n) reduction in the number of calibration measurements without sacrificing the ability to compensate for correlated errors. Our approach can be combined with, and simplify, other mitigation methods, allowing tractable mitigation even for large numbers of qubits.

AB The performance of Variational Quantum Algorithms (VQAs) strongly depends on the choice of the parameterized quantum circuit to optimize. One of the biggest challenges in VQAs is designing quantum circuits tailored to the particular problem. This article proposes a gradient-free Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) technique to automate the process of quantum circuit design. Our proposed technique introduces a novel formulation of the action space based on a sampling scheme and a progressive widening technique to explore the space dynamically. When testing our MCTS approach on the domain of random quantum circuits, MCTS approximates unstructured circuits under different values of stabilizer R & eacute;nyi entropy. It turns out that MCTS manages to approximate the benchmark quantum states independently from their degree of nonstabilizerness. Next, our technique exhibits robustness across various application domains, including quantum chemistry and systems of linear equations. Compared to previous MCTS research, our technique reduces the number of quantum circuit evaluations by a factor of 10 up to 100 while achieving equal or better results. In addition, the resulting quantum circuits exhibit up to three times fewer two-qubit gates, which is important for implementation on noisy quantum hardware.

TI Excess-noise suppression for a squeezed state propagating through random
   amplifying media via wave-front shaping
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB After propagating through a random amplifying medium, a squeezed state commonly shows excess noise above the shot-noise level. Since large noise can significantly reduce the signal-to-noise ratio, it is detrimental for precision measurement. To circumvent this problem, we propose a noise-reduction scheme using wave-front shaping. It is demonstrated that the average output quantum noise can be effectively suppressed even beyond the shot-noise limit. Both the decrease of amplification strength and the increase of input squeezing strength can give rise to a decrease in the suppressed average quantum noise. Our results not only show the feasibility of manipulating the output quantum noise of random amplifying media but also indicate potential applications in quantum information processing in complex environments, such as quantum imaging, quantum communication, and quantum key distribution.

TI Orthogonal-state-based measurement device independent quantum
   communication: a noise-resilient approach
SO AAPPS BULLETIN
AB We attempt to propose the first orthogonal-state-based protocols of measurement-device-independent quantum secure direct communication and quantum dialogue employing single basis, i.e., Bell basis as decoy qubits for eavesdropping detection. Orthogonal-state-based protocols are inherently distinct from conventional conjugate-coding protocols, offering unconditional security derived from the duality and monogamy of entanglement. Noise imposes a major challenge to the efficient implementation of these measurement-device-independent based secure direct quantum communication protocols. Notably, these orthogonal-state-based protocols demonstrate improved performance over conjugate-coding-based protocols under certain noisy environments, highlighting the significance of selecting the best basis choice of decoy qubits for secure quantum communication under collective noise. Further, we rigorously analyze the security of the proposed protocols against various eavesdropping strategies, including intercept-and-resend attack, entangle-and-measure attack, information leakage attack, flip attack, and disturbance or modification attack. Our findings also show that, with appropriate modifications, the proposed orthogonal-state-based measurement-device-independent quantum secure direct communication protocol can be transformed into orthogonal-state-based measurement-device-independent versions of quantum key distribution and quantum key negotiation protocols, expanding their applicability. Our protocols leverage fundamentally distinct resources to close the security loopholes linked to measurement devices, while also effectively doubling the distance for secure direct message transmission compared to traditional quantum secure direct communication protocols. Additionally, we calculate the efficiency of our proposed protocols and compare them with standard versions of measurement-device-independent quantum secure direct communication protocols. Ultimately, we discuss system and operational complexity of our proposed protocols in light of experimental elements and the processes.

TI Quantum technology master's: a shortcut to the quantum industry?
SO EPJ QUANTUM TECHNOLOGY
AB In this article, we investigate a growing trend in the worldwide Quantum Technology (QT) education landscape, that of the development of master's programs, intended to provide graduates with the knowledge and skills to take a job in the quantum industry, while serving a much shorter timeline than a doctoral degree. Through a global survey, we identified 86 master's programs, with substantial growth since 2021. Over time master's have become increasingly interdisciplinary, organised by multiple faculties or through joint degree programs, and offer more hands-on experiences such as internships in companies. Information from program organisers and websites suggests that the intended career destinations of their graduates are a diverse range of industries, and therefore master's programs may be a boon to the industrialisation of quantum technologies. Finally, we identify a range of national efforts to grow the quantum workforce of many countries, "quantum program enhancements", which augment the content of existing study programs with quantum content. This may further contribute to the growth and viability of master's programs as a route to the quantum industry.

TI Quantum Key Distribution over 658 km Fiber with Distributed Vibration
   Sensing
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB Twin-field quantum key distribution (TFQKD) promises ultralong secure key distribution which surpasses the rate distance limit and can reduce the number of the trusted nodes in long-haul quantum network. Tremendous efforts have been made toward implementation of TFQKD, among which, the secure key with finite size analysis can distribute more than 500 km in the lab and in the field. Here, we demonstrate the sending-or-not-sending TFQKD experimentally, achieving a secure key distribution with finite size analysis over a 658 km ultra-low-loss optical fiber. Meanwhile, in a TFQKD system, any phase fluctuation due to temperature variation and ambient variation during the channel must be recorded and compensated, and all this phase information can then be utilized to sense the channel vibration perturbations. With our quantum key distribution system, we recovered the external vibrational perturbations generated by artificial vibroseis on both the quantum and frequency calibration link, and successfully located the perturbation position in the frequency calibration fiber with a resolution better than 1 km. Our results not only set a new distance record of quantum key distribution, but also demonstrate that the redundant information of TFQKD can be used for remote sensing of the channel vibration, which can find applications in earthquake detection and landslide monitoring besides secure communication.

TI Efficient polarization-entangled state compensation in quantum
   entanglement distribution
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB The polarization states of the photons will be changed when distributing polarization-entangled photon pairs through their independent optical channels, whether satellite-based free-space or fiber-based links. Thus, it is essential to reconstruct the initial polarization-entangled state between their receiving ends. Here, we present an efficient compensation method based on coincidence measurements of entangled photons to restore the entanglement state. A unitary polarization transformation performed on a single optical link is sufficient using our method. Furthermore, we experiment to demonstrate the feasibility of this method by implementing the transformation with a set of three waveplates and employing one-step feedback. This study provides an efficient compensation technology for preserving the polarization-entangled state, which can be directly applied to applications involving quantum entanglement distribution.<br /> (c) 2025 Optica Publishing Group under the terms of the Optica Open Access Publishing Agreement

TI Engineering high-coherence superconducting qubits
SO NATURE REVIEWS MATERIALS
AB Advances in materials science and engineering have played a central role in the development of classical computers and will undoubtedly be critical in propelling the maturation of quantum information technologies. In approaches to quantum computation based on superconducting circuits, as one goes from bulk materials to functional devices, amorphous films and non-equilibrium excitations - electronic and phononic - are introduced, leading to dissipation and fluctuations that limit the computational power of state-of-the-art qubits and processors. In this Review, the major sources of decoherence in superconducting qubits are identified through an exploration of seminal qubit and resonator experiments. The proposed microscopic mechanisms associated with these imperfections are summarized, and directions for future research are discussed. The trade-offs between simple qubit primitives based on a single Josephson tunnel junction and more complex designs that use additional circuit elements, or new junction modalities, to reduce sensitivity to local noise sources are discussed, particularly in the context of materials optimization strategies for each architecture.
   Superconducting qubits hold great promise for quantum computing, and recently there have been dramatic improvements in both coherence times and the power of quantum processors. This Review explores how the path forward involves balancing circuit complexity and materials perfection, eliminating defects while designing qubits with engineered noise resilience.

TI QUANTUM ENTANGLEMENT OF N-LEVEL ATOMS UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF THERMAL
   ENVIRONMENTAL
SO THERMAL SCIENCE
AB This study investigates the quantum features of entanglement in N-level atomic systems subjected to varying Stark effect (SE) and intrinsic decoherence (ID) parameters. The quantum entanglement (QE) diminishes with increasing SE parameter, while the Quantum Fisher information (QFI) exhibits complex dynamics with no consistent trend across N-levels. Notably, distinct phase factor values influence the QFI differently, with certain phase factors yielding higher QFI values. The ID proves influential, causing a decline in both QFI and von Neumann entropy (VNE) magnitudes. The QFI experiences oscillations, dampening with heightened decoherence, and decays more rapidly than VNE. Additionally, the VNE displays differential behaviors among N-level systems, with the 3-level system maintaining a sustained steady-state compared to the 4- and 5-level systems. The QFI and VNE exhibit periodic behavior across a range of Stark parameter values and phase factors. These findings contribute to a nuanced understanding of entanglement dynamics in multi-level atomic systems under various influencing factors.

TI Realization of Fast All-Microwave Controlled-Z Gates with a Tunable
   Coupler
SO CHINESE PHYSICS LETTERS
AB The development of high-fidelity two-qubit quantum gates is essential for digital quantum computing. Here, we propose and realize an all-microwave parametric controlled-Z (CZ) gates by coupling strength modulation in a superconducting Transmon qubit system with tunable couplers. After optimizing the design of the tunable coupler together with the control pulse numerically, we experimentally realized a 100 ns CZ gate with high fidelity of 99.38% +/- 0.34% and the control error being 0.1%. We note that our CZ gates are not affected by pulse distortion and do not need pulse correction, providing a solution for the real-time pulse generation in a dynamic quantum feedback circuit. With the expectation of utilizing our all-microwave control scheme to reduce the number of control lines through frequency multiplexing in the future, our scheme draws a blueprint for the high-integrable quantum hardware design.

TI Near-Maximal Two-Photon Entanglement for Optical Quantum Communication
   at 2.1 μm
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW APPLIED
AB Owing to a reduced solar background and low propagation losses in the atmosphere, the 2- to 2.5-mu m waveband is a promising candidate for daylight quantum communication. This spectral region also offers low losses and low dispersion in hollow-core fibers and in silicon waveguides. We demonstrate near-maximally entangled photon pairs at 2.1 mu m that could support device-independent quantum key distribution (DIQKD), assuming sufficiently high channel efficiencies. The state corresponds to a positive secure-key rate (0.254 bits/pair, with a quantum bit error rate of 3.8%) based on measurements in a laboratory setting with minimal channel loss and transmission distance. This is promising for the future implementation of DIQKD at 2.1 mu m.

TI Dual opposing quadrature-PT symmetry
SO ISCIENCE
AB Our recent research on type-I quadrature parity-time (PT) symmetry, utilizing an open twin-beam system, not only enables observing genuine quantum photonic PT symmetry amid phase-sensitive amplification (PSA) and loss in the presence of Langevin noise but also reveals an additional classical-to-quantum (C2Q) transition in noise fluctuations. In contrast to the previous setup, our exploration of an alternative system assuming no loss involves a type-II PSA-only scheme. This scheme facilitates dual opposing quadrature-PT symmetry, offering a comprehensive and complementary comprehension of C2Q transitions and PT-enhanced quantum sensing with optimal performance in the symmetry unbroken region. Furthermore, our investigation into the quantum correlation with the Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen criteria uncovers previously unexplored connections between PT symmetry and nonclassicality, as well as quantum entanglement within the continuous-variable framework.

TI Bipolar spin-conversion diode and quantum entanglement induced by the

SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Herein, we report on a zigzag graphene superconducting junction with a superconductor sandwiched in between two magnetized zigzag graphene nanoribbons, where the valley and pseudoparity mixing are shown to bring about peculiar properties. We find that the bipolar spin diode and spin-conversion diode in the ferromagnetic configuration as well as quantum entanglement in the antiferromagnetic one are exhibited. The noncollinear angle combined with the valley and pseudoparity mixing in arbitrary magnetic configurations exerts a significant influence on the transport properties. In addition, not only the bipolar spin diode and magnetic storage with high efficiencies but also the bipolar spin-conversion diode and quantum entanglement can coexist in one setup. Particularly, the bipolar spin-conversion diode can be used to directly detect and confirm the helical spin texture of the edge state in a quantum spin Hall insulator.

TI Continuous-variable quantum computation of the O(3) model in 1+1
   dimensions
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB We formulate the O(3) nonlinear sigma model in 1 + 1 dimensions as a limit of a three-component scalar field theory restricted to the unit sphere in the large squeezing limit. This allows us to describe the model in terms of the continuous-variable (CV) approach to quantum computing. We construct the ground state and excited states using the coupled-cluster Ansatz and find excellent agreement with the exact diagonalization results for a small number of lattice sites. We then present the simulation protocol for the time evolution of the model using CV gates and obtain numerical results using a photonic quantum simulator. We expect that the methods developed in this paper will be useful for exploring interesting dynamics for a wide class of sigma models and gauge theories, as well as for simulating scattering events on quantum hardware in the coming decades.

TI Detecting and Imaging of Magnons at Nanoscale with van der Waals Quantum
   Sensor
SO ADVANCED FUNCTIONAL MATERIALS
AB Magnonic devices are extensively studied for energy-efficient information processing. High spatial resolution and high accuracy measurement is required to characterize the excitation and distribution of magnons. Here, sensing and imaging of magnons in the magnetic insulator Y3Fe5O12$\rm Y_3 Fe_5 O_{12}$ (YIG) is realized with negatively charged boron vacancy (VB-$V_{\rm {B}}<^>-$) spin defects in 2D hexagonal boron nitride (hBN). Thermal magnon noise is studied through spin relaxometry, illustrating the nanometers proximity of the 2D quantum sensor over a large area. The small probe-sample standoff distance helps to detect weak signals with diffraction-limited spatial resolution. The uniform out-of-plane symmetry axis of VB-$V_{\rm {B}}<^>{-}$ is further utilized to study perpendicular magnetic anisotropy (PMA). It effectively extracts the stray field of microwave-excited magnons from the direct stripline field. The distributions of propagating and localized magnons in different structures are subsequently imaged and analyzed. The work provides the strategy for utilizing the distinctive advantages of the van der Waals quantum sensor in magnetic imaging. The results will promote the development of magnonic devices for diverse applications.
   VB-$V_{\rm {B}}<^>{-}$ color center in hBN film is explored as 2D quantum sensor to detect the near-surface magnon stray field. With nanometers probe-sample distance and the uniform out-of-plane axis of spin sensor, the excitation and propagation of magnons in magnetic insulators are revealed with high accuracy and diffraction-limited spatial resolution. image

TI Approximate Quantum Compiling for Quantum Simulation: A Tensor Network
   Based Approach
SO ACM TRANSACTIONS ON QUANTUM COMPUTING
AB We introduce AQCtensor, a novel algorithm to produce short-depth quantum circuits from Matrix Product States (MPS). Our approach is specifically tailored to the preparation of quantum states generated from the time evolution of quantum many-body Hamiltonians. This tailored approach has two clear advantages over previous algorithms that were designed to map a generic MPS to a quantum circuit. First, we optimise all parameters of a parametric circuit at once using Approximate Quantum Compiling (AQC)-this is to be contrasted with other approaches based on locally optimizing a subset of circuit parameters and "sweeping" across the system. We introduce an optimisation scheme to avoid the so-called "orthogonality catastrophe"- i.e., the fact that the fidelity of two arbitrary quantum states decays exponentially with the number of qubits- that would otherwise render a global optimisation of the circuit impractical. Second, the depth of our parametric circuit is constant in the number of qubits for a fixed simulation time and fixed error tolerance. This is to be contrasted with the linear circuit Ansatz used in generic algorithms whose depth scales linearly in the number of qubits. For simulation problems on 100 qubits, we show that AQCtensor thus achieves at least an order of magnitude reduction in the depth of the resulting optimized circuit, as compared with the best generic MPS to quantum circuit algorithms. We demonstrate our approach on simulation problems on Heisenberg-like Hamiltonians on up to 100 qubits and find optimized quantum circuits that have signficantly reduced depth as compared with standard Trotterized circuits.

TI Unitary transformations using robust optimal control on a cold atom
   qudit
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB In this paper, we design and experimentally implement various robust quantum unitary transformations (gates) acting on d-dimensional vectors (qudits) by tuning a single control parameter using optimal control theory. The quantum state is represented by the momentum components of a Bose-Einstein condensate placed in an optical lattice, with the lattice position varying over a fixed duration serving as the control parameter. To evaluate the quality of these transformations, we employ standard quantum process tomography. In addition, we show how controlled unitary transformations can be used to extend state stabilization to global stabilization within a controlled vector subspace. Finally, we apply them to state tomography, showing how the information about the relative phase between distant momentum components can be extracted by inducing an interference process.

TI QMetrology from QCosmology: Study with entangled two qubit open quantum
   system in De Sitter space
SO SCIPOST PHYSICS CORE
AB In this paper, our prime objective is to apply the techniques of parameter estimation theory and the concept of Quantum Metrology in the form of Fisher Information to investigate the role of certain physical quantities in the open quantum dynamics of a two entangled qubit system under the Markovian approximation. There exist various physical parameters which characterize such system, but can not be treated as any quantum mechanical observable. It becomes imperative to do a detailed parameter estimation analysis to determine the physically consistent parameter space of such quantities. We apply both Classical Fisher Information (CFI) and Quantum Fisher Information (QFI) to correctly estimate these parameters, which play significant role to describe the out-of-equilibrium and the long range quantum entanglement phenomena of open quantum system. Quantum Metrology, compared to classical parameter estimation theory, plays a two-fold superior role, improving the precision and accuracy of parameter estimation. Additionally, in this paper we present a new avenue in terms of Quantum Metrology, which beats the classical parameter estimation. We also present an interesting result of revival of out-of-equilibrium feature at the late time scales, arising due to the long range quantum entanglement at early time scale and provide a physical interpretation for the same in terms of Bell's Inequality Violation in early time scale giving rise to non-locality.

TI Airborne Absolute Gravimetry With a Quantum Sensor, Comparison With
   Classical Technologies
SO JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-SOLID EARTH
AB We report an airborne gravity survey with an absolute gravimeter based on atom interferometry and two relative gravimeters: a classical LaCoste & Romberg (L & R) and a novel iMAR strapdown Inertial Measurement Unit. We estimated measurement errors for the quantum gravimeter ranging from 0.6 to 1.3 mGal depending on the flight conditions and the filtering used. Similar measurement errors are obtained with iMAR strapdown gravimeter, but the long-term stability is five times worse. The traditional L & R platform gravimeter shows larger measurement errors (3-4 mGal). Airborne measurements have been compared to marine, land, and altimetry-derived gravity data. We obtain a good agreement for the quantum gravimeter with standard deviations and means on differences below or equal to 2 mGal. This study confirms the potential of quantum technology for absolute airborne gravimetry, which is particularly interesting for mapping shallow water or mountainous areas and for linking ground and satellite measurements with homogeneous absolute referencing.

TI Interrelation of nonclassicality conditions through stabiliser group
   homomorphism
SO NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB In this paper, we show that coherence witness for a single qubit itself yields conditions for nonlocality and entanglement inequalities for multiqubit systems. It also yields a condition for quantum discord in two-qubit systems. It is shown by employing homomorphism among the stabiliser group of a single qubit and those of multi-qubit states. Interestingly, globally commuting homomorphic images of single-qubit stabilisers do not allow for consistent assignments of outcomes of local observables. We employ these observables for the construction of conditions for nonlocality, entanglement, and quantum discord. As an application, we show that CHSH inequality can be straightforwardly generalised to nonlocality inequalities for multiqubit GHZ states. It also reconfirms the fact that quantumness prevails even in the large N-limit if coherence is sustained. The mapping provides a way to construct many nonlocality inequalities, given a seed inequality. This study gives us a motivation to gain better control over multiple degrees of freedom and multi-party systems. It is because, in multi-party systems, the same nonclassical feature, viz, coherence may appear in many avatars.

TI Quantum entanglement & purity testing: A graph zeta function perspective
SO PHYSICS LETTERS A
AB We assign an arbitrary density matrix to a weighted graph and associate to it a graph zeta function that is both a generalization of the Ihara zeta function and a special case of the edge zeta function. We show that a recently developed bipartite pure state separability algorithm based on the symmetric group is equivalent to the condition that the coefficients in the exponential expansion of this zeta function are unity. Moreover, there is a one-to-one correspondence between the nonzero eigenvalues of a density matrix and the singularities of its zeta function. Several examples are given to illustrate these findings.& COPY; 2023 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier B.V.

TI Integrated lithium niobate photonics for high-speed quantum key
   distribution
SO OPTICA QUANTUM
AB Photonic integration in quantum communication holds significant potential for miniaturization and enabling commercial applications. Among various platforms, thin-film lithium niobate (TFLN) stands out due to its exceptional combination of high electro-optical efficiency, low propagation loss, and compact footprint. Here, we demonstrate a 2.5 GHz chip-to-chip fully integrated quantum key distribution (QKD) system based on a TFLN platform, which incorporates high-speed dual-polarization time-bin phase encoding and decoding functionalities. We achieve an extremely low quantum bit error rate of 0.53% and a secret key rate exceeding 10 Mbps over 25 km fiber spools. The design of cascaded Mach-Zehnder modulators effectively suppresses the patterning effect in high speed QKD. Notably, the TFLN chips used in both the transmitter and receiver share a similar architecture, highlighting the potential for creating a homogeneous transceiver. This work paves the way for high-speed, miniaturized QKD systems based on the lithium niobate integrated platform.

TI Experimental Distributed Quantum Sensing in a Noisy Environment
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB The precision advantages offered by harnessing the quantum states of sensors can be readily compromised by noise. However, when the noise has a different spatial function than the signal of interest, recent theoretical work shows how the advantage can be maintained and even significantly improved. In this Letter, we experimentally demonstrate the associated sensing protocol, using trapped-ion sensors. An entangled state of multidimensional sensors is created that isolates and optimally detects a signal, while being insensitive to otherwise overwhelming noise fields with different spatial profiles over the sensor locations. The quantum protocol is found to outperform a perfect implementation of the best comparable strategy without sensor entanglement. While our demonstration is carried out for magnetic and electromagnetic fields over a few microns, the technique is readily applicable over arbitrary distances and for arbitrary fields, thus present a promising application for emerging quantum sensor networks.

TI Integration of the Fokker-Planck equation on quantum computers: a new
   path to modelling nonlinear dynamics
SO PROCEEDINGS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY A-MATHEMATICAL PHYSICAL AND ENGINEERING
   SCIENCES
AB For quantum computers to become useful tools to physicists, engineers and computational scientists, quantum algorithms for solving nonlinear differential equations need to be developed. Despite recent advances, the quest for a solver that can integrate nonlinear dynamical systems with a quantum advantage, while being realizable on available (or near-term) quantum hardware, is an open challenge. In this paper, we transform a nonlinear dynamical system into a linear system, which we integrate with quantum algorithms. Key to the method is the Fokker-Planck equation, which is a non-normal partial differential equation. Three approaches are proposed: (i) forward-Euler stepping by block encoding; (ii) Schr & ouml;dingerization and (iii) forward-Euler stepping by a linear combination of unitaries. We emulate the integration of prototypical nonlinear systems with the proposed quantum solvers and compare the output with the benchmark solutions of classical integrators. We find that classical and quantum outputs are in good agreement. This paper opens opportunities for solving nonlinear differential equations with quantum algorithms.

TI Message Group Optimization in Kyber-512 Post-Quantum Cryptography:
   Comparing Proposed Static Encoding With Huffman Code, Base-64, and ASCII
   Methods
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC) indicates a significant progression in cryptographic research. Kyber-512, a principal algorithm in the Kyber family, has attained international standard certification in PQC. A primary limitation of Kyber-512 is the requirement to convert plaintext into a polynomial equation of degree 256 before the encapsulation process is applied to satisfy the parameter specifications. Then, greater computational resources are required, especially when evaluating large messages that require segmentation into smaller parts. This paper proposes techniques to reduce the bit-length per character, hence minimizing the number of segments required for encapsulation and decapsulation processes. The method utilizes a customized mapping table allocating a fixed-length 6-bit code to each fundamental character, including uppercase English letters, digits, and certain symbols, amounting to a total of 54 characters. In fact, two techniques are presented for integration with the mapping table and Kyber-512. The first method divides the characters into groups of 42, because it is the largest size that remains inside 256 bits. This method generates a 4-bit waste in each group. Therefore, the second method is implemented to resolve this problem by shifting the bits across groups. Furthermore, Pre-Check-Tailing (PRT) and Post-Check-Tailing (PST) are suggested to reduce the mistakes induced by padding on the plaintext's tail segment. The evaluation includes a comparative examination of ASCII Code, Base-64 and Huffman Code. Experimental results indicate that Huffman Code achieves excellent data reduction and rapid processing speed, because of the frequency-based compression methodology. However, the dependence on providing a Huffman tree with the message presents possible security vulnerabilities by disclosing statistical characteristics of the original plaintext. Although a Huffman tree can also be encapsulated together with the compressed plaintext, this requires a double-encryption structure, which increases computational overhead and contradicts the goal of minimizing processing requirements in PQC. In fact, the proposed methods ensure consistent security attributes and demonstrate a significant reduction in message segmentation related to ASCII Code and Base-64. It has significant promise for application in resource-constrained situations, such as IoT devices and smartphones, providing diminished processing requirements without risking security.

AB In the Noisy Intermediate Scale Quantum (NISQ) era, the dynamic nature of quantum systems causes noise sources to constantly vary over time. Transient errors from the dynamic NISQ noise landscape are challenging to comprehend and are especially detrimental to classes of applications that are iterative and/or long-running, and therefore their timely mitigation is important for quantum advantage in real-world applications.
   The most popular examples of iterative long-running quantum applications are variational quantum algorithms (VQAs). Iteratively, VQA's classical optimizer evaluates circuit candidates on an objective function and picks the best circuits towards achieving the application's target. Noise fluctuation can cause a significant transient impact on the objective function estimation of the VQA iterations' tuning candidates. This can severely affect VQA tuning and, by extension, its accuracy and convergence.
   This paper proposes QISMET: Quantum Iteration Skipping to Mitigate Error Transients, to navigate the dynamic noise landscape of VQAs. QISMET actively avoids instances of high fluctuating noise which are predicted to have a significant transient error impact on specific VQA iterations. To achieve this, QISMET estimates transient error in VQA iterations and designs a controller to keep the VQA tuning faithful to the transient-free scenario. By doing so, QISMET efficiently mitigates a large portion of the transient noise impact on VQAs and is able to improve the fidelity by 1.3x-3x over a traditional VQA baseline, with 1.6-2.4x improvement over alternative approaches, across different applications and machines.

Although the existing SMT-solverbased synthesis cannot treat H and T gates directly, our method treats the functionality of quantum-specific T and H gates carefully so that we can utilize an SMT-solver to minimize the number of CNOT gates; unlike the existing SMT-solver-based methods, our method considers "Don't Care" conditions in intermediate points of a quantum circuit by exploiting the property of T gates to reduce CNOT gates. Experimental results show that our approach can reduce the number of CNOT gates by 58.11% on average compared to the naive application of the existing method which does not consider the "Don't Care" condition.

TI Quantifying Exciton-Photon Entanglement in Semiconductor Microcavities:
   A Closed Formula for Strong and Weak Coupling Regimes
SO IEEE PHOTONICS JOURNAL
AB Semiconductor microcavities have great potential for quantum information science, quantum optics, and quantum sensing. Researchers designing devices based on these microcavities could benefit from having accurate figures of merit to guide their design and enhance the entanglement latency and strength of their devices. This article presents a closed formula for computing the exciton-photon concurrence in semiconductor microcavities. The formula is tailored for the ultralow density limit of both excitons and photons, allowing a better understanding of the entanglement properties in this regime. The closed formula allows for accurate and easy quantification of the exciton-photon coupling strength in terms of the parameters of the system like the couplings, frequencies, and linewidths, which has applications in quantum optics and quantum information science. The presented formulas can be used in rational microcavity design for various applications, such as single-photon sources, quantum light sources, and optoelectronic devices. This contributes to the systematic design and control of entanglement properties of quantum devices tailored for specific tasks in quantum information science, quantum optics, and quantum sensing. In summary, this work represents a valuable contribution to both practical applications and fundamental research in the fields of nanostructures, quantum optics, and quantum information science.

TI Measuring network quantum steerability utilizing artificial neural
   networks
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Network quantum steering plays a pivotal role in quantum information science, enabling robust certification of quantum correlations in scenarios with asymmetric trust assumptions among network parties. The intricate nature of quantum networks, however, poses significant challenges for the detection and quantification of steering. In this work, we develop a neural network-based method for measuring network quantum steerability, which can be generalized to arbitrary quantum networks and naturally applied to standard steering scenarios. Our method provides an effective framework for steerability analysis, demonstrating remarkable accuracy and efficiency in standard bipartite and multipartite steering scenarios. Numerical simulations involving isotropic states and noisy Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger states yield results that are consistent with established findings in these respective scenarios. Furthermore, we demonstrate its utility in the bilocal network steering scenario, where an untrusted central party shares two-qubit isotropic states of different visibilities, nu and omega, with trusted end-point parties and performs a single Bell state measurement. Through explicit construction of a network local hidden state model derived from numerical results and incorporation of the entanglement properties of network assemblages, we analytically demonstrate that the network steering thresholds are determined by the curve nu omega = 1/3 under the corresponding configuration.

TI Analytical Algorithm for Capacities of Classical and Classical-Quantum
   Channels
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INFORMATION THEORY
AB We derive an analytical algorithm for the channel capacity of a classical channel without any iteration, while its existing algorithms require iterations and the number of iterations depends on the required precision level. Hence, our algorithm is its first analytical algorithm for this task without any iteration, while this algorithm needs several conditions for the channel. We apply the obtained algorithm to examples, and see how the obtained algorithm works in these examples. Then, we extend it to the channel capacity of a classical-quantum (cq-) channel. Many existing studies proposed algorithms for a cq-channel and all of them require iterations. Our extended analytical algorithm has also no iteration, and outputs the exactly optimum value.

TI Semiconductor qubits in practice
SO NATURE REVIEWS PHYSICS
AB Semiconductor qubits are expected to have diverse future quantum applications. This Review discusses semiconductor qubit implementations from the perspective of an ecosystem of applications, such as quantum simulation, sensing, computation and communication.
   In the past decade, semiconducting qubits have made great strides in overcoming decoherence, improving the prospects for scalability and have become one of the leading contenders for the development of large-scale quantum circuits. In this Review, we describe the current state of the art in semiconductor charge and spin qubits based on gate-controlled semiconductor quantum dots, shallow dopants and colour centres in wide-bandgap materials. We frame the relative strengths of the different semiconductor qubit implementations in the context of applications such as quantum simulation, computing, sensing and networks. By highlighting the status and future perspectives of the basic types of semiconductor qubits, this Review aims to serve as a technical introduction for non-specialists and a forward-looking reference for scientists intending to work in this field.

TI Convexification of the Quantum Network Utility Maximization Problem
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON QUANTUM ENGINEERING
AB Network utility maximization (NUM) addresses the problem of allocating resources fairly within a network and explores the ways to achieve optimal allocation in real-world networks. Although extensively studied in classical networks, NUM is an emerging area of research in the context of quantum networks. In this work, we consider the quantum network utility maximization (QNUM) problem in a static setting, where a user's utility takes into account the assigned quantum quality (fidelity) via a generic entanglement measure, as well as the corresponding rate of entanglement generation. Under certain assumptions, we demonstrate that the QNUM problem can be formulated as an optimization problem with the rate allocation vector as the only decision variable. Using a change-of-variable technique known in the field of geometric programming, we then establish sufficient conditions under which this formulation can be reduced to a convex problem: a class of optimization problems that can be solved efficiently and with certainty even in high dimensions. We further show that this technique preserves convexity, enabling us to formulate convex QNUM problems in networks where some routes have certain entanglement measures that do not readily admit convex formulation while others do. This allows us to compute the optimal resource allocation in networks where heterogeneous applications run over different routes.

TI Supersymmetry-assisted high-fidelity ground-state preparation of a
   single neutral atom in an optical tweezer
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Arrays of neutral-atom qubits in optical tweezers are a promising platform for quantum computation. Despite experimental progress, a major roadblock for realizing neutral-atom quantum computation is the qubit initialization. Here we propose that supersymmetry, a theoretical framework developed in particle physics, can be used for ultrahigh-fidelity initialization of neutral-atom qubits. We show that a single atom can be deterministically prepared in the vibrational ground state of an optical tweezer by adiabatically extracting all excited atoms to a supersymmetric auxiliary tweezer. The scheme works for both bosonic and fermionic atom qubits trapped in realistic Gaussian optical tweezers and may pave the way for realizing large-scale quantum computation, simulation, and information processing with neutral atoms.

TI Investigating the dissipation of heat and quantum information from
   DNA-scaffolded chromophore networks
SO JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL PHYSICS
AB Scaffolded molecular networks are important building blocks in biological pigment-protein complexes, and DNA nanotechnology allows analogous systems to be designed and synthesized. System-environment interactions in these systems are responsible for important processes, such as the dissipation of heat and quantum information. This study investigates the role of nanoscale molecular parameters in tuning these vibronic system-environment dynamics. Here, genetic algorithm methods are used to obtain nanoscale parameters for a DNA-scaffolded chromophore network based on comparisons between its calculated and measured optical spectra. These parameters include the positions, orientations, and energy level characteristics within the network. This information is then used to compute the dynamics, including the vibronic population dynamics and system-environment heat currents, using the hierarchical equations of motion. The dissipation of quantum information is identified by the system's transient change in entropy, which is proportional to the heat currents according to the second law of thermodynamics. These results indicate that the dissipation of quantum information is highly dependent on the particular nanoscale characteristics of the molecular network, which is a necessary first step before gleaning the systematic optimization rules. Subsequently, the I-concurrence dynamics are calculated to understand the evolution of the vibronic system's quantum entanglement, which are found to be long-lived compared to these system-bath dissipation processes.

TI Efficient implementation of arbitrary two-qubit gates using unified
   control
SO NATURE PHYSICS
AB The set of quantum logic gates that can be easily implemented is fundamental to the performance of quantum computers, as it governs the accuracy of basic quantum operations and dictates the complexity of implementing quantum algorithms. Traditional approaches to extending gate sets often require operating devices outside the ideal parameter regimes used to realize qubits, leading to increased control complexity while offering only a limited set of gates. Here we experimentally demonstrate a unified and versatile gate scheme capable of generating arbitrary two-qubit gates using only an exchange interaction and qubit driving on a superconducting quantum processor. We achieve high fidelities averaging 99.38% across a wide range of commonly used two-qubit unitaries, enabling precise multipartite entangled state preparation. Furthermore, we successfully produce a B gate, which efficiently synthesizes the entire family of two-qubit gates. Our results establish that fully exploiting the capabilities of the exchange interaction can yield a comprehensive and highly accurate gate set. With maximum expressivity, optimal gate time, demonstrated high fidelity and easy adaption to other quantum platforms, our unified control scheme offers the prospect of improved performance in quantum hardware and algorithm development.

TI Practical Quantum Key Distribution That is Secure Against Side Channels
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW APPLIED
AB There is a large gap between theory and practice in quantum key distribution (QKD) because real devices do not satisfy the assumptions required by the security proofs. Here, we close this gap by introducing a simple and practical measurement-device-independent-QKD type of protocol, based on the transmission of coherent light, for which we prove its security against any possible imperfection and/or side channel from the quantum communication part of the QKD devices. Our approach only requires to experimentally characterize an upper bound of one single parameter for each of the pulses sent, which describes the quality of the source. Moreover, unlike device-independent (DI) QKD, it can accommodate information leakage from the users' laboratories, which is essential to guarantee the security of QKD implementations. In this sense, its security goes beyond that provided by DI QKD, yet it delivers a secret key rate that is various orders of magnitude greater than that of DI QKD.

TI Optimized steering: Quantum state engineering and exceptional points
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB The state of a quantum system may be steered towards a predesignated target state, employing a sequence of weak blind measurements (where the detector's readouts are traced out). Here we analyze the steering of a two-level system using the interplay of a system Hamiltonian and weak measurements and show that any pure or mixed state can be targeted. We show that the optimization of such a steering protocol is underlain by the presence of Liouvillian exceptional points. More specifically, for high-purity target states, optimal steering implies purely relaxational dynamics marked by a second-order exceptional point, whereas for low-purity target states, it implies an oscillatory approach to the target state. The dynamical phase transition between these two regimes is characterized by a third-order exceptional point.

SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB The quest to identify and observe Majorana fermions in physics and condensed -matter systems remains an important challenge. Here, we introduce a qubit (spin -1 / 2) from the occurrence of two delocalized zero -energy Majorana fermions in a model of two spins -1 / 2 on the Bloch sphere within the fractional one-half topological state. We address specific protocols in time with circularly polarized light and the protection of this delocalized spin -1 / 2 state related to quantum information protocols. We also show how disorder can play a positive and important role allowing singlet -triplet transitions and resulting in an additional elongated region for the fractional phase, demonstrating the potential of this platform related to applications in topologically protected quantum information. We generalize our approach with an array and Majorana fermions at the edges in a ring geometry.

TI Traveling-wave parametric ampli fi er- induced qubit dephasing analysis
   and mitigation
SO CHIP
AB The mitigation of dephasing poses a signi fi cant challenge to improving the performance of error-prone superconducting quantum computing systems. Here, the dephasing of a transmon qubit in a dispersive readout regime was investigated by adopting a Josephson traveling-wave parametric ampli fi er as the preampli fi er. Our fi ndings reveal that the potent pump leakage from the preampli fi er may lead to severe dephasing. This could be attributed to a mixture of measurement-induced dephasing, ac Stark effect, and heating. It is showed that pulse-mode readout is a promising measurement scheme to mitigate qubit dephasing while minimizing the need for bulky circulators. Our work provides key insights into mitigating decoherence from microwave-pumped preampli fi ers, which will be critical for advancing large-scale quantum computers.

TI Intrinsically Stable 2-GHz Polarization Modulation for Satellite-Based
   Quantum Key Distribution
SO IEEE PHOTONICS JOURNAL
AB Satellite-based quantum key distribution (QKD) has made significant strides in the past few years, and an international space race toward practical quantum networks has begun. Being one major encoding method, highly robust, high-performance and miniaturized polarization modulation is critical to meet the needs of future satellite applications. Here, we employ the Sagnac-based method to realize inherent-stable polarization modulation and propose a novel optical design to achieve a state-of-the-art repetition rate of 2 GHz. This value approaches the theoretical repetition frequency limit with commercially-available phase modulators. Furthermore, the polarization encoder is miniaturized into a robust 6.0 cm x 6.5 cm module and two commercially mature phase modulators. A 90-min consecutive test was successfully performed, verifying the robustness of this scheme with an average quantum bit error rate as low as 0.42%. The presented intrinsically stable high-speed polarization modulation provides an effective solution for future satellite applications.

TI A systematic literature review of quantum object detection and
   recognition: research trend, datasets, topics and methods
SO INTELLIGENT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS
AB Quantum computing is a computational process that utilizes quantum mechanics features, namely superposition, interference, and entanglement, in information processing, allowing computation to run in parallel. The advantage of quantum computing is that it solves complex problems whereas classical computing is impossible because it requires expensive computing costs. Object detection and recognition is a task of computer vision, where research in this field aims to improve the ability of computer algorithms to produce interpretations of visual information. Humans easily analyze and describe the visual information received. However, unlike computer systems, they must learn and explore using machine learning from the visual information received to provide correct interpretations of visual information. This paper presents a systematic review of papers published from 2012 to 2024 to answer how far quantum object detection and recognition research has been conducted. The methodology of this review follows a systematic literature review such as the method proposed by Kitchenham et al. The selected primary studies amounted to 29 papers from four source digital libraries. The application of quantum algorithms is more often used to improve the performance of classical computing. The quantum model category consists of 3 types, namely pure quantum, hybrid classical-quantum, and quantuminspired ML. Hybrid classical-quantum is the most discussed model and Quantum Convolutional Neural Network is the most frequently discussed algorithm or model in image classification from 2012 to 2024. Quantum algorithms show good results and can improve the performance of classical algorithms, although currently, the ability of quantum computing is not fully optimal because the development of quantum computers is still in the noisy intermediate-scale quantum era. However, with the current limited quantum computing capabilities, it can already outperform the capabilities of classical computing. Based on this, studies on quantum object detection and recognition need to be carried out so that when the full potential of quantum computing can be utilized, the user's capacity is competent.

There are still some inevitable flaws, which give quantum hackers the opportunity to manipulate the channel in complex communication environments and launch Denial of Service attacks on the quantum channel. Therefore, a DoS attack-aware defense scheme for the CVQKD system based on convolutional neural networks (CNN) is proposed. The simulation results show that the proposed model can effectively detect DoS attacks launched by quantum hackers in CVQKD system in a complex communication environment, and the model has strong robustness due to the addition of the attention mechanism module. In addition, multiple sets of comparative experiments show that compared with the existing artificial neural network model, the CNN-based model has higher accuracy and stability.

TI Strong Zero Modes in Integrable Quantum Circuits
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB It is a classic result that certain interacting integrable spin chains host robust edge modes known as strong zero modes (SZMs). In this Letter, we extend this result to the Floquet setting of local quantum circuits, focusing on a prototypical model providing an integrable Trotterization for the evolution of the XXZ Heisenberg spin chain. By exploiting the algebraic structures of integrability, we show that an exact SZM operator can be constructed for these integrable quantum circuits in certain regions of parameter space. Our construction, which recovers a well-known result by Paul Fendley in the continuous-time limit, relies on a set of commuting transfer matrices known from integrability, and allows us to easily prove important properties of the SZM, including normalizabilty. Our approach is different from previous methods and could be of independent interest even in the Hamiltonian setting. Our predictions, which are corroborated by numerical simulations of infinite-temperature autocorrelation functions, are potentially interesting for implementations of the XXZ quantum circuit on available quantum platforms.

TI Noise dynamics of quantum annealers: estimating the effective noise
   using idle qubits
SO QUANTUM SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB Quantum annealing is a type of analog computation that aims to use quantum mechanical fluctuations in search of optimal solutions of QUBO (quadratic unconstrained binary optimization) or, equivalently, Ising problems. Since NP-hard problems can in general be mapped to Ising and QUBO formulations, the quantum annealing paradigm has the potential to help solve various NP-hard problems. Current quantum annealers, such as those manufactured by D-Wave Systems, Inc. have various practical limitations including the size (number of qubits) of the problem that can be solved, the qubit connectivity, and error due to the environment or system calibration, which can reduce the quality of the solutions. Typically, for an arbitrary problem instance, the corresponding QUBO (or Ising) structure will not natively embed onto the available qubit architecture on the quantum chip. Thus, in these cases, a minor embedding of the problem structure onto the device is necessary. However, minor embeddings on these devices do not always make use of the full sparse chip hardware graph, and a large portion of the available qubits stay unused during quantum annealing. In this work, we embed a disjoint random QUBO on the unused parts of the chip alongside the QUBO to be solved, which acts as an indicator of the solution quality of the device over time. Using experiments on three different D-Wave quantum annealers, we demonstrate that (i) long term trends in solution quality exist on the D-Wave device, and (ii) the unused qubits can be used to measure the current level of noise of the quantum system.

TI Quantum Algorithms' Approach: A Case Study on Bladeless Wind Turbine and
   Solar Panel
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB The researched data shows that quantum algorithms have been mostly used for battery's chemistry and conventional grid systems. These algorithms have proved to be computationally cheaper as a common meritorious aspect in almost all implementations. However, usage of quantum algorithms to integrate two renewable energy systems is yet to be explored. This study investigates the application of quantum algorithms-Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE), Variational Quantum Deflation (VQD), Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA), and Quantum Amplitude Estimation (QAE)-to optimize energy extraction from solar panels and bladeless wind turbines. Nine different optimizers are used on 3066 and 11547 datapoints of wind and solar respectively, to comment about optimality between QAOA, VQD and VQE. Results demonstrate that optimizers like NELDER_MEAD and COBYLA excel in convergence speed, whereas in case of energy minimization SPSA and SLSQP for VQE, COBYLA and P_BFGS for VQD have outperformed other optimizers. QAOA effectively tackles combinatorial optimization tasks as convergence speed for all optimizers has been relatively rapid. Since VQE, VQD and QAOA have not been accurate in finding optimal data point, hence QAE is utilized. Additionally, QAE's precision in amplifying high-probability quantum states aligns well with the periodic and structured nature of wind and solar energy datasets.

TI Quantum simulation of PT-arbitrary-phase-symmetric systems
SO EPL
AB Parity-time-reversal (PT) symmetric quantum mechanics promotes the increasing research interest of non-Hermitian (NH) systems for the theoretical value, novel properties, and links to open and dissipative systems in various areas. Recently, anti-PT-symmetric systems and their featured properties have started to be investigated. In this work, we develop the PT and anti-PT symmetry to PT-arbitrary-phase symmetry (or PT-phi symmetry) for the first time, being analogous to bosons, fermions and anyons. It can also be seen as a complex extension of the PT symmetry, unifying the PT and anti-PT symmetries and having intermediate properties between them. Many of the established concepts and mathematics in the PT-symmetric system are still compatible. We mainly investigate quantum simulation of this novel NH system in two dimensions in detail and discuss for higher-dimensional cases in general using the linear combinations of unitaries in the scheme of duality quantum computing, enabling implementations and experimental investigations of novel properties on both small quantum devices and near-term quantum computers.

TI An Improved Convolutional Neural Networks: Quantum Pseudo-Transposed
   Convolutional Neural Networks
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB Recent advancements in quantum machine learning have spurred the development of hybrid quantum-classical convolutional neural networks (HQCCNNs), which have demonstrated promising potential for image classification tasks. Building on the operational principles of classical transposed convolutional neural networks (CNNs), we introduce a novel quantum variant: the Quantum Pseudo-Transposed Convolutional Neural Network (QPTCNN). The QPTCNN adapts the concept of classical transposed CNNs to the quantum domain, leveraging a hybrid quantum-classical framework that combines a quantum convolutional layer with a classical fully connected layer. In the QPTCNN, the quantum convolutional layer emulates a transposed convolution operation, ensuring that the output feature map retains the same dimensions as the input image. This is accomplished using rotational angle encoding and a ring-structured quantum circuit, interconnected by two-qubit control gates such as CNOT and CRY gates, facilitating efficient quantum convolution. We evaluated the performance of the QPTCNN on the MNIST and Fashion-MNIST datasets, with two distinct versions of the model: Model A, which utilizes a CNOT-gate entanglement circuit, and Model B, which employs a CRY-gate entanglement circuit. The results demonstrate that both Model A and Model B achieve strong performance across the datasets. However, Model A outperforms Model B, achieving higher classification accuracy and lower loss compared to earlier models. These findings suggest that the QPTCNN is highly capable of learning and extracting relevant feature information from input images, making it well-suited for high-performance image classification tasks. This work represents a significant advancement in quantum-enhanced image classification.

AB The Ising model with a transverse field and an antiferromagnetic transverse interaction is represented as a matrix in the computational basis with non-zero off-diagonal elements with both positive and negative signs and thus may be regarded to be non-stoquastic. We show that the local Boltzmann factors of such a system under an appropriate Suzuki-Trotter representation can be chosen non-negative and thus may potentially be simulated classically without a sign problem if the parameter values are limited to a subspace of the whole parameter space. We then derive conditions for parameters to satisfy asymptotically in order that simulated quantum annealing of this system converges to thermal equilibrium in the long-time limit.

TI Experimental qudit state estimation via point tomography
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Point tomography is an approach to the problem of state estimation, which is arguably the most efficient and simple method for modern high-precision quantum information experiments. In this scenario, the experimenter knows the target state that their device should prepare, except that intrinsic systematic errors will create small discrepancies in the state actually produced. By introducing a kind of informationally complete measurement, dubbed Fisher-symmetric measurements, point tomography determines deviations from the expected state with optimal efficiency. Moreover, the number of outcomes of a measurement saturating the Gill-Massar limit for reconstructing d-dimensional quantum states can be greatly reduced from similar to 4d - 3 to only 2d - 1 outcomes. Thus, improving the measurement overhead as the dimension increases. Here we demonstrate the experimental viability of point tomography. Using a modern photonic platform constructed with state-of-the-art multicore optical fiber technology, we generate four-dimensional quantum states and implement seven-outcome Fishersymmetric measurements. Our experimental results exhibit the main feature of point tomography, namely, a precision close to the Gill-Massar limit with a single few-outcome measurement. Specifically, we achieved a precision of (3.81 +/- 0.05)/N, while the Gill-Massar limit for d = 4 is 3/N (N being the ensemble size).

TI Quantum Authentication Evolution: Novel Approaches for Securing Quantum
   Key Distribution
SO ENTROPY
AB This study introduces a novel approach to bolstering quantum key distribution (QKD) security by implementing swift classical channel authentication within the SARG04 and BB84 protocols. We propose mono-authentication, a pioneering paradigm employing quantum-resistant signature algorithms-specifically, CRYSTALS-DILITHIUM and RAINBOW-to authenticate solely at the conclusion of communication. Our numerical analysis comprehensively examines the performance of these algorithms across various block sizes (128, 192, and 256 bits) in both block-based and continuous photon transmission scenarios. Through 100 iterations of simulations, we meticulously assess the impact of noise levels on authentication efficacy. Our results notably highlight CRYSTALS-DILITHIUM's consistent outperformance of RAINBOW, with signature overheads of approximately 0.5% for the QKD-BB84 protocol and 0.4% for the QKD-SARG04 one, when the quantum bit error rate (QBER) is augmented up to 8%. Moreover, our study unveils a correlation between higher security levels and increased authentication times, with CRYSTALS-DILITHIUM maintaining superior efficiency across all key rates up to 10,000 kb/s. These findings underscore the substantial cost and complexity reduction achieved by mono-authentication, particularly in noisy environments, paving the way for more resilient and efficient quantum communication systems.

TI Entangled resource for interfacing single- and dual-rail optical qubits
SO QUANTUM
AB Today's most widely used method of encoding quantum information in optical qubits is the dual-rail basis, often carried out through the polarisation of a single photon. On the other hand, many stationary carriers of quantum information - such as atoms - couple to light via the single-rail encoding in which the qubit is encoded in the number of photons. As such, interconversion between the two encodings is paramount in order to achieve cohesive quantum networks. In this paper, we demonstrate this by generating an entangled resource between the two encodings and using it to teleport a dual-rail qubit onto its single-rail counterpart. This work completes the set of tools necessary for the interconversion between the three primary encodings of a qubit in the optical field: single-rail, dual-rail and continuous-variable.

TI Quantum reinforcement learning: the maze problem
SO QUANTUM MACHINE INTELLIGENCE
AB Quantum machine learning (QML) is a young but rapidly growing field where quantum information meets machine learning. Here, we will introduce a new QML model generalising the classical concept of reinforcement learning to the quantum domain, i.e. quantum reinforcement learning (QRL). In particular, we apply this idea to the maze problem, where an agent has to learn the optimal set of actions in order to escape from a maze with the highest success probability. To perform the strategy optimisation, we consider a hybrid protocol where QRL is combined with classical deep neural networks. In particular, we find that the agent learns the optimal strategy in both the classical and quantum regimes, and we also investigate its behaviour in a noisy environment. It turns out that the quantum speedup does robustly allow the agent to exploit useful actions also at very short time scales, with key roles played by the quantum coherence and the external noise. This new framework has the high potential to be applied to perform different tasks (e.g. high transmission/processing rates and quantum error correction) in the new-generation noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices whose topology engineering is starting to become a new and crucial control knob for practical applications in real-world problems. This work is dedicated to the memory of Peter Wittek.

TI On the emerging potential of quantum annealing hardware for
   combinatorial optimization
SO JOURNAL OF HEURISTICS
AB Over the past decade, the usefulness of quantum annealing hardware for combinatorial optimization has been the subject of much debate. Thus far, experimental benchmarking studies have indicated that quantum annealing hardware does not provide an irrefutable performance gain over state-of-the-art optimization methods. However, as this hardware continues to evolve, each new iteration brings improved performance and warrants further benchmarking. To that end, this work conducts an optimization performance assessment of D-Wave Systems' Advantage Performance Update computer, which can natively solve sparse unconstrained quadratic optimization problems with over 5,000 binary decision variables and 40,000 quadratic terms. We demonstrate that classes of contrived problems exist where this quantum annealer can provide run time benefits over a collection of established classical solution methods that represent the current state-of-the-art for benchmarking quantum annealing hardware. Although this work does not present strong evidence of an irrefutable performance benefit for this emerging optimization technology, it does exhibit encouraging progress, signaling the potential impacts on practical optimization tasks in the future.

TI Quantum entanglement in cosmology
SO PHYSICS REPORTS-REVIEW SECTION OF PHYSICS LETTERS
AB We discuss recent progress in the study of entanglement within cosmological frameworks, focusing on both momentum and position-space approaches and also reviewing the possibility to directly extract entanglement from quantum fields. Entanglement generation in expanding spacetimes can be traced back to the phenomenon of gravitational particle production, according to which the background gravitational field may transfer energy and momentum to quantum fields. The corresponding entanglement amount and its mode dependence are both sensitive to the field statistics and to the details of spacetime expansion, thus encoding information about the background. Gravitational production processes also play a key role in addressing the quantum-to-classical transition of cosmological perturbations. In order to directly extract entanglement from quantum fields, local interactions with additional quantum systems, working as detectors, have been suggested, leading to the formulation of the entanglement harvesting protocol. Despite harvesting procedures are currently unfeasible from an experimental point of view, various proposals for implementation exist and a proper modeling of detectors and local interactions is crucial to address entanglement extraction via realistic setups. In the final part of the work, we address entanglement characterization in position space, primarily focusing on black hole spacetimes. We first investigate a possible interpretation of Bekenstein-Hawking black hole entropy in terms of the entanglement entropy arising in discrete quantum field theories, on account of the area law. Then, we discuss the resolution of the black hole information paradox via the gravitational fine-grained entropy formula, which provides a new way to compute the entropy of Hawking radiation and allows to preserve unitarity in black hole evaporation processes.

TI Building bridges in quantum information science education: expert
   insights to guide framework development for interdisciplinary teaching
   and evolution of common language
SO EPJ QUANTUM TECHNOLOGY
AB The rapid growth of quantum information science and technology (QIST) presents unique educational challenges as it brings together students and researchers from many disciplines. This work presents findings from in-depth interviews with leading quantum researchers who are also educators, whose perspectives provide guidance for developing a framework for interdisciplinary QIST teaching and builds on our earlier paper that focused on QIST courses and curricula. We discuss quantum educators' reflections on three critical aspects of QIST education: (1) the development of a common interdisciplinary language, (2) determining appropriate levels of abstraction and physical detail for diverse student populations from various disciplines, and (3) why students should pursue courses, degrees, and careers in this rapidly evolving field. Our analysis reveals that the emergence of linguistic evolutions such as "qubits" and "measurement bases", rather than a focus on measurement of physical observables and their corresponding Hermitian operators, has begun to create a unifying framework that transcends disciplinary boundaries. Nevertheless, educators face ongoing challenges in balancing the level of abstractness with physical details as well as mathematical rigor with conceptual accessibility, particularly when teaching foundational QIST courses to an interdisciplinary group of students. The experts emphasize that successful QIST education for an interdisciplinary student body not only requires a shift from traditional quantum mechanics pedagogy for physics majors, but careful consideration of students' diverse prior conceptual and mathematical foundations overall. They encourage students to pursue QIST related courses, degrees, and careers, highlighting the unique historical opportunity to participate in creating transformative quantum technologies while developing transferable skills for an evolving technological landscape. These findings provide valuable guidance for developing a framework for interdisciplinary QIST teaching especially useful for foundational courses.

TI Bayesian optimization of Fisher Information in nonlinear multiresonant
   quantum photonics gyroscopes
SO NANOPHOTONICS
AB We propose an on-chip gyroscope based on nonlinear multiresonant optics in a thin film chi (2) resonator that combines high sensitivity, compact form factor, and low power consumption simultaneously. We theoretically analyze a novel holistic metric - Fisher Information capacity of a multiresonant nonlinear photonic cavity - to fully characterize the sensitivity of our gyroscope under fundamental quantum noise conditions. Leveraging Bayesian optimization techniques, we directly maximize the nonlinear multiresonant Fisher Information. Our holistic optimization approach orchestrates a harmonious convergence of multiple physical phenomena - including noise squeezing, nonlinear wave mixing, nonlinear critical coupling, and noninertial signals - all encapsulated within a single sensor-resonator, thereby significantly augmenting sensitivity. We show that similar to 470x improvement is possible over the shot-noise limited linear gyroscope with the same footprint, intrinsic quality factors, and power budget.

TI Standard quantum annealing outperforms adiabatic reverse annealing with
   decoherence
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB We study adiabatic reverse annealing (ARA) in an open system. In the closed system (unitary) setting, this annealing protocol allows avoidance of first-order quantum phase transitions of selected models, resulting in an exponential speedup compared with standard quantum annealing, provided that the initial state of the algorithm is close in Hamming distance to the target one. Here, we show that decoherence can significantly modify this conclusion: by resorting to the adiabatic master equation approach, we simulate the dynamics of the ferromagnetic p-spin model with p = 3 under independent and collective dephasing. For both models of decoherence, we show that the performance of open system ARA is far less sensitive to the choice of the initial state than its unitary counterpart, and, most significantly, that open system ARA by and large loses its time to solution advantage compared to standard quantum annealing. These results suggest that as a stand-alone strategy ARA is unlikely to experimentally outperform standard "forward" quantum annealing, and that error mitigation strategies will likely be required in order to realize the benefits of ARA in realistic, noisy settings.

TI On Dynamical Measures of Quantum Information
SO ENTROPY
AB In this work, we use the theory of quantum states over time to define joint entropy for timelike-separated quantum systems. For timelike-separated systems that admit a dual description as being spacelike-separated, our notion of entropy recovers the usual von Neumann entropy for bipartite quantum states and thus may be viewed as a spacetime generalization of von Neumann entropy. Such an entropy is then used to define dynamical extensions of quantum joint entropy, quantum conditional entropy, and quantum mutual information for systems separated by the action of a quantum channel. We provide an in-depth mathematical analysis of such information measures and the properties they satisfy. We also use such a dynamical formulation of entropy to quantify the information loss/gain associated with the dynamical evolution of quantum systems, which enables us to formulate a precise notion of information conservation for quantum processes. Finally, we show how our dynamical entropy admits an operational interpretation in terms of quantifying the amount of state disturbance associated with a positive operator- valued measurement.

TI Three-Dimensional Photonic Integrated Chips: Quantum Computation and
   Non-Classical Physics (Invited)
SO LASER & OPTOELECTRONICS PROGRESS
AB Femtosecond laser fabrication technology enables high-precision three-dimensional (3D) direct writing, allowing the on-demand fabrication of 3D coupled waveguide systems for constructing 3D photonic integrated chips. This review summarizes recent advances in 3D photonic integrated chips based on femtosecond laser direct writing (FLDW) optical waveguides in the fields of photonic quantum computation and non-classical physics. For photonic quantum computation, this review highlights the logic gates for universal photonic quantum computation, quantum-walk-based specialized photonic quantum computation chips, and topologically protected photonic quantum computation chips. For non-classical physics, the review focuses on applications of 3D photonic integrated chips in nonreciprocal photonics, non-Hermitian physics, and non-Abelian physics, exhibiting the exceptional capabilities of 3D photonic integrated chips. Finally, key challenges faced by the practical application of FLDW 3D photonic integrated chips are analyzed and potential solutions for limited integration density, difficult gain implementation, poor tunability, and weak nonlinear response are proposed.

TI A More General Quantum Credit Risk Analysis Framework
SO ENTROPY
AB Credit risk analysis (CRA) quantum algorithms aim at providing a quadratic speedup over classical analogous methods. Despite this, experts in the business domain have identified significant limitations in the existing approaches. Thus, we proposed a new variant of the CRA quantum algorithm to address these limitations. In particular, we improved the risk model for each asset in a portfolio by enabling it to consider multiple systemic risk factors, resulting in a more realistic and complex model for each asset's default probability. Additionally, we increased the flexibility of the loss-given-default input by removing the constraint of using only integer values, enabling the use of real data from the financial sector to establish fair benchmarking protocols. Furthermore, all proposed enhancements were tested both through classical simulation of quantum hardware and, for this new version of our work, also using QPUs from IBM Quantum Experience in order to provide a baseline for future research. Our proposed variant of the CRA quantum algorithm addresses the significant limitations of the current approach and highlights an increased cost in terms of circuit depth and width. In addition, it provides a path to a substantially more realistic software solution. Indeed, as quantum technology progresses, the proposed improvements will enable meaningful scales and useful results for the financial sector.

TI HUBO formulations for solving the eigenvalue problem
SO RESULTS IN CONTROL AND OPTIMIZATION
AB Solving the eigenvalue problem is particularly important in almost all fields of science and engineering. With the development of quantum computers, multiple algorithms have been proposed for this purpose. However, such methods are usually only applicable to matrices of specific types, such as unitary or Hermitian matrices. The quantum annealer of the DWave, a quantum computer, returns the minimum value of the quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO) model. Thus, quantum annealers can be leveraged to solve arbitrary eigenvalue problems by formulating corresponding QUBO models. In this paper, we propose two higher -order unconstrained optimization (HUBO) formulations to solve eigenvalue problems involving n x n general matrices. In addition, we use a formula to reduce the order and convert the HUBO model into a QUBO model. Further, by using a quantum approximate optimization algorithm, this method can be extended to a gate -model quantum computer.

TI Quantum computing for market research
SO JOURNAL OF INNOVATION & KNOWLEDGE
AB The digital ecosystem continues to expand around the world and is revolutionising the way markets are researched. Indeed, consumer experiences are advertised and disseminated through so many channels and media that it has become a major challenge for researchers and marketing practitioners to collect, process and generate valuable information to support strategic and operational decisions. In this article, the authors explore how advances in quantum computing, which can be used to process huge amounts of data quickly and accurately, could offer an unprecedented opportunity for researchers to address the challenges of the digital ecosystem. Three studies are presented to define the state of the art and future expectations of quantum computing in market research and business. By means of a bibliometric analysis of 209 publications and a content analysis of the 30 highest-impact articles, we describe the present landscape, and also forecast the future with the help of in-depth interviews with eight experts. The findings reveal that the US and China are at the forefront of scientific development, but the contributions from four other countries (India, the UK, Canada and Spain) are also in double figures. However, graphical analysis identifies four poles of development: the US orbit, which includes Canada and Spain; the Chinese orbit, which includes India; the UK orbit; and the Australian orbit. In terms of expectations, the experts agree on the opportunities offered by quantum computing, but there is less consensus as to how long it will take to develop. (c) 2024 The Authors.

TI Dynamic Framework for Criticality-Enhanced Quantum Sensing
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB Quantum criticality, as a fascinating quantum phenomenon, may provide significant advantages for quantum sensing. Here we propose a dynamic framework for quantum sensing with a family of Hamiltonians that undergo quantum phase transitions (QPTs). By giving the formalism of the quantum Fisher information (QFI) for quantum sensing based on critical quantum dynamics, we demonstrate its divergent feature when approaching the critical point. We illustrate the basic principle and the details of experimental implementation using quantum Rabi model. The framework is applicable to a variety of examples and does not rely on the stringent requirement for particular state preparation or adiabatic evolution. It is expected to provide a route towards the implementation of criticality-enhanced quantum sensing.

TI Multi-Objective Portfolio Optimization Using a Quantum Annealer
SO MATHEMATICS
AB In this study, the portfolio optimization problem is explored, using a combination of classical and quantum computing techniques. The portfolio optimization problem with specific objectives or constraints is often a quadratic optimization problem, due to the quadratic nature of, for example, risk measures. Quantum computing is a promising solution for quadratic optimization problems, as it can leverage quantum annealing and quantum approximate optimization algorithms, which are expected to tackle these problems more efficiently. Quantum computing takes advantage of quantum phenomena like superposition and entanglement. In this paper, a specific problem is introduced, where a portfolio of loans need to be optimized for 2030, considering 'Return on Capital' and 'Concentration Risk' objectives, as well as a carbon footprint constraint. This paper introduces the formulation of the problem and how it can be optimized using quantum computing, using a reformulation of the problem as a quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO) problem. Two QUBO formulations are presented, each addressing different aspects of the problem. The QUBO formulation succeeded in finding solutions that met the emission constraint, although classical simulated annealing still outperformed quantum annealing in solving this QUBO, in terms of solutions close to the Pareto frontier. Overall, this paper provides insights into how quantum computing can address complex optimization problems in the financial sector. It also highlights the potential of quantum computing for providing more efficient and robust solutions for portfolio management.

TI Direct observation of a few-photon phase shift induced by a single
   quantum emitter in a waveguide
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Realizing a sensitive photon-number-dependent phase shift on a light beam is required both in classical and quantum photonics. It may lead to new applications for classical and quantum photonics machine learning or pave the way for realizing photon-photon gate operations. Nonlinear phase-shifts require efficient light-matter interaction, and recently quantum dots coupled to nanophotonic devices have enabled near-deterministic single-photon coupling. We experimentally realize an optical phase shift of 0.19 pi +/- 0.03 radians ( approximate to 34 degrees) using a weak coherent state interacting with a single quantum dot in a planar nanophotonic waveguide. The phase shift is probed by interferometric measurements of the light scattered from the quantum dot in the waveguide. The process is nonlinear in power, the saturation at the single-photon level and compatible with scalable photonic integrated circuitry. The work may open new prospects for realizing high-efficiency optical switching or be applied for proof-of-concept quantum machine learning or quantum simulation demonstrations.
   The ability to imprint phase shifts on light lie at the basis of several classical and quantum light-based information processing primitives. Here, the authors demonstrate the phase shift of an optical field by a single quantum emitter in a waveguide, at the single photon level.

TI QUANTUM ALGORITHMS FOR COMMUNITY DETECTION AND THEIR EMPIRICAL RUN-TIMES
SO QUANTUM INFORMATION & COMPUTATION
AB We apply recent work [9] on empirical estimates of quantum speedups to the practical task of community detection in complex networks. We design several quantum variants of a popular classical algorithm - the Louvain algorithm for community detection - and first study their complexities in the usual way, before analysing their complexities empirically across a variety of artificial and real inputs. We find that this analysis yields insights not available to us via the asymptotic analysis, further emphasising the utility in such an empirical approach. In particular, we observe that a complicated quantum algorithm with a large asymptotic speedup might not be the fastest algorithm in practice, and that a simple quantum algorithm with a modest speedup might in fact be the one that performs best. Moreover, we repeatedly find that overheads such as those arising from the need to amplify the success probabilities of quantum sub-routines such as Grover search can nullify any speedup that might have been suggested by a theoretical worst- or expected-case analysis.

TI Experimental Test of Contextuality Based on State Discrimination with a
   Single Qubit
SO CHINESE PHYSICS LETTERS
AB Exploring quantum phenomena beyond predictions of any classical model has fundamental importance to understand the boundary of classical and quantum descriptions of nature. As a typical property that a quantum system behaves distinctively from a classical counterpart, contextuality has been studied extensively and verified experimentally in systems composed of at least three levels (qutrit). Here we extend the scope of experimental test of contextuality to a minimal quantum system of only two states (qubit) by implementing the minimum error state discrimination on a single Yb-171(+) ion. We observe a substantial violation of a no-go inequality derived by assuming non-contextuality, and firmly conclude that the measured results of state discrimination cannot be reconciled with any non-contextual description. We also quantify the contextual advantage of state discrimination and the tolerance against quantum noises.

TI A comparison of quantum compilers using a DAG-based or phase
   polynomial-based intermediate representation
SO JOURNAL OF SYSTEMS AND SOFTWARE
AB In the NISQ era, where quantum computing is dominated by hybrid quantum algorithms, it is important for quantum circuits to be well-optimized to reduce noise from unnecessary gates. We investigate different phase polynomial-based compilation strategies to determine the current best practices and compare them against the DAG-based Qiskit and TKET compilers. We find that phase polynomial-based compiling is very fast compared to DAG-based compiling. For long circuits, these compilers generate fewer CNOT gates than Qiskit or TKET, but for short circuits, they are quite inefficient. We also show that supplementary algorithms such as Reverse Traversal and simulated annealing mightimprove the generated CNOT count slightly, but the effect is negligible inmost settings and generally not worth the additional compiler runtime. Instead, more sophisticated phase polynomial synthesis algorithms are needed.

However, all the results have focused on discrete groups with discrete oracle functions. In this paper, we define the continuous hidden shift problem on R-n with a continuous oracle function as an extension of the hidden shift problem, and also define the epsilon-random linear disequations which is a generalization of the random linear disequations. By employing the newly defined concepts, we show that there exists a quantum computational algorithm which solves this problem in time polynomial in n.

TI Co-Design quantum simulation of nanoscale NMR
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Quantum computers have the potential to efficiently simulate the dynamics of nanoscale NMR systems. In this work, we demonstrate that a noisy intermediate-scale quantum computer can be used to simulate and predict nanoscale NMR resonances. In order to minimize the required gate fidelities, we propose a superconducting application-specific Co-Design quantum processor that reduces the number of SWAP gates by over 90% for chips with more than 20 qubits. The processor consists of transmon qubits capacitively coupled via tunable couplers to a central co-planar waveguide resonator with a quantum circuit refrigerator (QCR) for fast resonator reset. The QCR implements the nonunitary quantum operations required to simulate nuclear hyperpolarization scenarios.

TI Coherence dynamics in quantum algorithm for linear systems of equations
SO PHYSICA SCRIPTA
AB Quantum coherence is a fundamental issue in quantum mechanics and quantum information processing. We explore the coherence dynamics of the evolved states in HHL quantum algorithm for solving the linear system of equation Ax(->)=b(->). By using the Tsallis relative alpha entropy of coherence and the l(1,p) norm of coherence, we show that the operator coherence of the phase estimation P relies on the coefficients beta(i) obtained by decomposing divide b (sic) in the eigenbasis of A. We prove that the operator coherence of the inverse phase estimation P relies on the coefficients beta( i ), eigenvalues of A and the success probability P-s , and it decreases with the increase of the probability when alpha is an element of (1, 2]. Moreover, the variations of coherence deplete with the increase of the success probability and rely on the eigenvalues of A as well as the success probability.

TI LYAPUNOV EXPONENTS FOR QUANTUM CHANNELS: AN ENTROPY FORMULA AND GENERIC
   PROPERTIES
SO JOURNAL OF DYNAMICAL SYSTEMS AND GEOMETRIC THEORIES
AB We denote by M-k the set of k by k matrices with complex entries. We consider quantum channels phi(L) of the form: given a measurable function L : M-k -> M-k and a measure mu on M-k we define the linear operator phi(L) : M-k -> M-k, by the law rho -> phi(L)(rho) = integral M-k L(v)rho L(v)(dagger) d mu(v).
   In a previous work, the authors show that for a fixed measure mu the Phi-Erg property is generic on the function L (also irreducibility). Here we will show that the purification property is also generic on L for a fixed mu.
   Given L and mu there are two related stochastic processes: one takes values on the projective space P(C-k) and the other on matrices in M-k. The Phi-Erg property and the purification condition are the nice hypothesis for the discrete time evolution given by the natural transition probability. In this way it will follow that generically on L, if integral vertical bar L(v)vertical bar(2) log vertical bar L(v)vertical bar d mu(v) < infinity, the yapunov exponents infinity > gamma(1) >= gamma(2) >= ... >= gamma(k) >= -infinity are well defined.
   In a previous work, the concepts of entropy of a channel and Gibbs channel were presented; and also an example (associated to a stationary Markov chain) in which this definition of entropy (for a quantum channel) matches the Kolmogorov-Shanon definition of entropy. We estimate here the larger Lyapunov exponent for the mentioned example and we show that it is equal to -1/2 h, where h is the entropy of the associated Markov invariant probability.

TI Classical chaos in quantum computers
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB The development of quantum computing hardware is facing the challenge that current-day quantum processors, comprising 50-100 qubits, already operate outside the range of quantum simulation on classical computers. In this paper we demonstrate that the simulation of classical limits can be a potent diagnostic tool for the resilience of quantum information hardware against chaotic instabilities potentially mitigating this problem. As a testbed for our approach we consider the transmon qubit processor, a computing platform in which the coupling of large numbers of nonlinear quantum oscillators may trigger destabilizing chaotic resonances. We find that classical and quantum simulations lead to similar stability metrics (classical Lyapunov exponents vs quantum wave function participation ratios) in systems with O(10) transmons. However, the big advantage of classical simulation is that it can be pushed to large systems comprising up to thousands of qubits. We exhibit the utility of this classical toolbox by simulating all current IBM transmon chips, including the 433-qubit processor of the Osprey generation, as well as devices with 1121 qubits (Condor generation). For realistic system parameters, we find a systematic increase of Lyapunov exponents with system size, suggesting that larger layouts require added efforts in information protection.

TI Conserved charges in the quantum simulation of integrable spin chains
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICS A-MATHEMATICAL AND THEORETICAL
AB When simulating the time evolution of quantum many-body systems on a digital quantum computer, one faces the challenges of quantum noise and of the Trotter error due to time discretization. For certain spin chains, it is possible to discretize the time evolution preserving integrability, so that an extensive set of conserved charges are exactly conserved after discretization. In this work we implement, on real quantum computers and on classical simulators, the integrable Trotterization of the spin-1/2 Heisenberg XXX spin chain. We study how quantum noise affects the time evolution of several conserved charges, and observe the decay of the expectation values. We in addition study the early time behaviors of time evolution, which can potentially be used to benchmark quantum devices and algorithms in the future. We also provide an efficient method to generate the conserved charges at higher orders.

TI Spin-qubit control with a milli-kelvin CMOS chip
SO NATURE
AB A key virtue of spin qubits is their sub-micron footprint, enabling a single silicon chip to host the millions of qubits required to execute useful quantum algorithms with error correction1, 2-3. However, with each physical qubit needing multiple control lines, a fundamental barrier to scale is the extreme density of connections that bridge quantum devices to their external control and readout hardware4, 5-6. A promising solution is to co-locate the control system proximal to the qubit platform at milli-kelvin temperatures, wired up by miniaturized interconnects7, 8, 9-10. Even so, heat and crosstalk from closely integrated control have the potential to degrade qubit performance, particularly for two-qubit entangling gates based on exchange coupling that are sensitive to electrical noise11,12. Here we benchmark silicon metal-oxide-semiconductor (MOS)-style electron spin qubits controlled by heterogeneously integrated cryo-complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (cryo-CMOS) circuits with a power density sufficiently low to enable scale-up. Demonstrating that cryo-CMOS can efficiently perform universal logic operations for spin qubits, we go on to show that milli-kelvin control has little impact on the performance of single- and two-qubit gates. Given the complexity of our sub-kelvin CMOS platform, with about 100,000 transistors, these results open the prospect of scalable control based on the tight packaging of spin qubits with a 'chiplet-style' control architecture.

TI Measurement-device-independent quantum key distribution with leaky
   sources
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB Measurement-device-independent quantum key distribution (MDI-QKD) can remove all detection side-channels from quantum communication systems. The security proofs require, however, that certain assumptions on the sources are satisfied. This includes, for instance, the requirement that there is no information leakage from the transmitters of the senders, which unfortunately is very difficult to guarantee in practice. In this paper we relax this unrealistic assumption by presenting a general formalism to prove the security of MDI-QKD with leaky sources. With this formalism, we analyze the finite-key security of two prominent MDI-QKD schemes-a symmetric three-intensity decoy-state MDI-QKD protocol and a four-intensity decoy-state MDI-QKD protocol-and determine their robustness against information leakage from both the intensity modulator and the phase modulator of the transmitters. Our work shows that MDI-QKD is feasible within a reasonable time frame of signal transmission given that the sources are sufficiently isolated. Thus, it provides an essential reference for experimentalists to ensure the security of implementations of MDI-QKD in the presence of information leakage.

TI Towards underwater quantum communication in the mesoscopic intensity
   regime
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB The problem of secure underwater communication can take advantage of the exploitation of quantum resources and novel quantum technologies. At variance with the current experiments performed at the single photon level, here we propose a different scenario involving mesoscopic twin-beam states of light and two classes of commercial photon-number-resolving detectors. We prove that twin-beam states remain nonclassical even if the signal propagates in tubes filled with water, while the idler is transmitted in free space. We also demonstrate that from the study of the nonclassicality information about the loss and noise sources affecting the transmission channels can be successfully extracted.

TI Quantum Implementation of a Genetic Algorithm
SO MEMORIA INVESTIGACIONES EN INGENIERIA
AB This work provides a generalized view of the current state of quantum genetic algorithms (QGAs), showing the advances made in this research field over the last 24 years. QGAs combine concepts from quantum computing and classical genetic algorithms (CGAs), allowing them to address complex search and optimization problems efficiently. The main findings and contributions of these quantum algorithms are presented, highlighting the most promising trends and approaches, as well as the challenges and limitations that need to be overcome. New approaches and implementation techniques for QGAs are presented, including quantum genetic operators and efficient coding schemes that contribute to improving the performance and convergence of the algorithms. QGAs and other similar approaches, such as CGAs and pure quantum algorithms, are compared, highlighting the relative advantages and disadvantages of QGAs compared to their classical versions. An implementation of QGA using the Qiskit library is also shown. The selection of the methods used for the generation of the initial population, the crossing and the mutation of the different populations of the quantum circuits simulated in the experiments carried out are presented, exemplifying the significant advantages that these can bring in comparison with classical approaches.

TI Topological order detection and qubit encoding in Su-Schrieffer-Heeger
   type quantum dot arrays
SO JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYSICS
AB In this study, building on the 1D topological Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) model, we propose a model of quantum dot arrays with odd and even parity and variable on-site local potentials to examine topological edge states and a possible quantum information encoding, using these states. We first investigate the SSH model with alternating tunneling amplitudes t(1) and t(2). We study the model in a ring-like structure and then proceed to minimal open-end chains with even ( N = 4) and odd ( N = 5) number of dots. Furthermore, we depart from the basic SSH model by introducing local potentials mu(i), which offer additional control at the cost of breaking the chiral symmetry of the Hamiltonian and study the implications. Then, we propose an idealized "static " charge qubit design, based on encoding the topological invariant nu as qubit states, that exploits the topological nature of the edge states and their collective character. We introduce perturbing noise delta t(q)( t ) into the system and demonstrate the robustness of the states for some range of the ratio xi = t(1)/t(2). Moreover, we show a possible way to detect the presence of topological order in the system using equilibrium dynamics for both even and odd chains. We utilize the quantum informatic measure of bipartite mutual information I-{ b : e } (( 2 )) ( t ) as a measure of bulk-edge quantum correlations and a quantitative indicator for the manifestation of bulk-edge correspondence; here, we also propose a dynamical qubit encoding with nu for specific quantum chain parity. Finally, we offer a few remarks on potential future explorations.

The research addresses the critical challenge of computational efficiency and resource constraints in analyzing data from the upcoming High Luminosity Large Hadron Collider, presenting the architecture as a potential solution. In particular, we evaluate our method by applying the model to multi-detector jet images from CMS Open Data. The goal is to distinguish quark-initiated from gluon-initiated jets. We successfully train the quantum model and evaluate it via numerical simulations. Using this approach, we achieve classification performance almost on par with the one obtained with the completely classical architecture, considering a similar number of parameters.

TI An Easy-Implemented On-Chip Waveguide Coupled Single Photon Source Based
   on Self-Assembled Quantum Dots Membrane
SO APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL
AB Featured Application
   This work has an application in realizing on-chip quantum photonic circuits with integrated quantum emitters for quantum computation or quantum communication.
   In recent years, many groups and institutions have been committed to the research of integrated quantum photonic circuit technologies, of which the key components are waveguide coupled single photon sources. In this study, we propose an on-chip waveguide-coupled single photon source that is easily implemented as the waveguide is directly made from the quantum dot membrane. In order to scatter light out of the on-chip waveguide plane into the detection apparatus, grating output couplers are made at both ends of the waveguide. The photon statistics of the on-chip photon source were investigated by second-order correlation function g((2))(tau) measurements using a Hanbury Brown and Twiss interferometer. From the spectra and cross-correlation experiments by collecting emission at the point of quantum dot and out coupler, the emitting of single photons from the same quantum dot and propagating via the waveguide to the out couplers was confirmed. These results show that we have achieved an on-chip single photon source that is easily implemented and easily integrated into quantum photonic circuits.

TI Quantum Gaussian process regression for Bayesian optimization
SO QUANTUM MACHINE INTELLIGENCE
AB Gaussian process regression is a well-established Bayesian machine learning method. We propose a new approach to Gaussian process regression using quantum kernels based on parameterized quantum circuits. By employing a hardware-efficient feature map and careful regularization of the Gram matrix, we demonstrate that the variance information of the resulting quantum Gaussian process can be preserved. We also show that quantum Gaussian processes can be used as a surrogate model for Bayesian optimization, a task that critically relies on the variance of the surrogate model. To demonstrate the performance of this quantum Bayesian optimization algorithm, we apply it to the hyperparameter optimization of a machine learning model which performs regression on a real-world dataset. We benchmark the quantum Bayesian optimization against its classical counterpart and show that quantum version can match its performance.

TI Swap Test with Quantum Dot Charge Qubits
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW APPLIED
AB We propose the implementation of the swap test using a charge qubit in a double quantum dot. The swap test is a fundamental quantum subroutine in quantum machine learning and other applications for estimating the fidelity of two unknown quantum states by measuring an auxiliary qubit. Our proposal uses a controlled three-qubit gate, which is natural to quantum dot charge qubits. It allows us to implement a swap test with a circuit depth of six layers, and an estimated gate time of less than 3 ns, that is below the coherence time of double quantum dots. This work paves the way for enhancing the toolbox of quantum machine learning developments in semiconductor qubits.

However, building up a real quantum computer system not only relies on the theory of universality, but also needs methods to satisfy requirements on other features, such as programmability, modularity, scalability, etc. To this end, here we study the recently proposed model of quantum von Neumann architecture by putting it in a practical and broader setting, namely, the hierarchical design of a computer system. We analyze the structures of quantum CPU and quantum control units and draw their connections with computational advantages. We also point out that a recent demonstration of our model would require less than 20 qubits.

TI Quantum sensing effect of electron tunneling in DQD/analyte complex
SO AIP ADVANCES
AB We investigate electron tunneling between quantum dots and molecules to propose a quantum sensor. This sensor consists of double quantum dots (DQD) with energy levels specifically tailored to mirror those of the target analyte. By analyzing the spectral distribution of electron localizations in the DQD system, we can delineate the analyte's spectrum and deduce its composition by comparing it with a reference sample. To understand electron tunneling dynamics within the DQD/analyte complex, we performed three-dimensional computational modeling applying the effective potential approach to the InAs/GaAs heterostructure. In this modeling, we mimicked the analyte spectrum by utilizing a quantum well characterized by a quasi-discrete spectrum. Our calculations reveal the inherent potential of utilizing this method as a highly sensitive and selective sensor.

TI 7 km free-space time-bin quantum key distribution
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB Satellite-based quantum key distribution (QKD) holds the potential to establish global quantum communication networks. While satellite QKD has been demonstrated using polarization encoding, time-bin encoding offers distinct advantages, such as simplifying polarization-maintaining telescope designs and being insensitive to satellite-ground relative motion. In this work, we developed a 625-MHz QKD light source using a robust Sagnacinterferometer-based modulation scheme and subsequently demonstrated time-bin QKD over a 7 km urban terrestrial free-space channel. This experiment successfully operated over a channel traversing an equivalent atmospheric thickness and loss exceeding that of typical satellite-to-ground links, achieving a low quantum bit error rate of 0.87% and a secure key rate of 134 bps@51.4 dB. Furthermore, by using a half-wave plate to simulate the polarization-basis-rotation inherent in such links, we verified the robustness of time-bin encoding for satellite scenarios. The results validate time-bin encoding as a compelling alternative and lay the technical foundation for future satellite QKD applications.

TI Quantum computing for heavy quarkonium spectroscopy
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW D
AB We report a first demonstration for the application of quantum computing to heavy quarkonium spectroscopy study. Based on a Cornell-potential model for the heavy quark and antiquark system, we show how this Hamiltonian problem can be formulated and solved with the variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) approach on the IBM cloud quantum computing platform. Errors due to a global depolarizing noise channel are corrected with a zero-noise extrapolation method, resulting in good agreement with the expected value. We also generalize the VQE method for solving excited states by orthogonalization with respect to the ground state. This new approach is demonstrated to be successful for the quarkonium system on a noiseless quantum simulator and can easily be adapted for solving similar excited state problems in many other physical systems.

TI Synthesizing Five-Body Interaction in a Superconducting Quantum Circuit
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB Synthesizing many-body interaction Hamiltonians is a central task in quantum simulation. However, it is challenging to synthesize Hamiltonians that have more than two spins in a single term. Here we synthesize m-body spin-exchange Hamiltonians with m up to 5 in a superconducting quantum circuit by simultaneously exciting multiple independent qubits with time-energy correlated photons generated from a qudit. The dynamic evolution of the m-body interaction is governed by the Rabi oscillation between two m-spin states, in which the states of each spin are different. We demonstrate the scalability of our approach by comparing the influence of noises on the three-, four- and five-body interaction and building a manybody Mach-Zehnder interferometer which potentially has a Heisenberg-limit sensitivity. This study paves a way for quantum simulation involving many-body interaction Hamiltonians such as lattice gauge theories in quantum circuits.

TI DNA as a perfect quantum computer based on the quantum physics

SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB DNA is a complex multi-resolution molecule whose theoretical study is a challenge. Its intrinsic multiscale nature requires chemistry and quantum physics to understand the structure and quantum informatics to explain its operation as a perfect quantum computer. Here, we present theoretical results of DNA that allow a better description of its structure and the operation process in the transmission, coding, and decoding of genetic information. Aromaticity is explained by the oscillatory resonant quantum state of correlated electron and hole pairs due to the quantized molecular vibrational energy acting as an attractive force.

TI Directional scrambling of quantum information in helical multiferroics
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
AB Local excitations as carriers of quantum information spread out in the system in ways governed by the underlying interaction and symmetry. Understanding this phenomenon, also called quantum scrambling, is a prerequisite for employing interacting systems for quantum information processing. The character and direction dependence of quantum scrambling can be inferred from the out-of-time-ordered commutators (OTOCs) containing information on correlation buildup and entanglement spreading. Employing OTOC, we study and quantify the directionality of quantum information propagation in oxide-based helical spin systems hosting a spin-driven ferroelectric order. In these systems, magnetoelectricity permits the spin dynamics and associated information content to be controlled by an electric field coupled to the emergent ferroelectric order. We show that topologically nontrivial quantum phases, such as chiral or helical spin ordering, allow for electric-field controlled anisotropic scrambling and a direction-dependent buildup of quantum correlations. Based on general symmetry considerations, we find that starting from a pure state (e.g., the ground state) or a finite temperature state is essential for observing directional asymmetry in scrambling. In the systematic numerical studies of OTOC on finite-size helical multiferroic chains, we quantify the directional asymmetry of the scrambling and verify the conjectured form of the OTOC around the ballistic wavefront. The obtained direction-dependent butterfly velocity v(B)(n) provides information on the speed of the ballistic wavefront. In general, our calculations show an early time power-law behavior of OTOC, as expected from an analytic expansion for small times. The long-time behavior of OTOC reveals the importance of (non)integrability of the underlying Hamiltonian as well as the implications of conserved quantities such as the z projection of the total spin. The results point to the potential of spin-driven ferroelectric materials for the use in solid-state-based quantum information processing.

In this paper we propose QBRICKS, a formal verification environment for circuit-building quantum programs, featuring both parametric specifications and a high degree of proof automation. We propose a logical framework based on first-order logic, and develop the main tool we rely upon for achieving the automation of proofs of quantum specification: PPS, a parametric extension of the recently developed path sum semantics. To back-up our claims, we implement and verify parametric versions of several famous and non-trivial quantum algorithms, including the quantum parts of Shor's integer factoring, quantum phase estimation (QPE) and Grover's search.

TI Dynamic Security-Aware Resource Allocation in Quantum Key
   Distribution-Enabled Optical Networks
SO PHOTONICS
AB The demand for secure communication in the age of quantum technologies has driven progress in quantum key distribution (QKD) techniques for optical networks. This research addresses the issues of high blocking probabilities (BPs) and the proper utilization of quantum resources in varying network loads by introducing a novel heuristic approach, termed dynamic security-aware quantum resource allocation (D-SQRA), designed for dynamic resource allocation in QKD-enabled optical networks. We propose two D-SQRA algorithms to employ an adaptive resource assignment (RA) strategy that concurrently addresses routing, wavelength, and time-slot selection while dynamically modifying security levels according to the real-time network load and resource availability. We evaluate the proposed D-SQRA performance against two conventional methods, namely, fixed security quantum resource allocation (F-SQRA) and baseline quantum resource allocation (B-QRA). We discuss the results for NSFNET and UBN24 topologies for network security performance metrics such as network security performance (NSP), BP, quantum key utilization (QKU), and time-slot utilization. The results show that the proposed D-SQRA algorithms provide significant improvement with respect to conventional techniques in addressing proper resource utilization and management by reducing BPs of the new incoming connection requests.

TI Simulation of an entanglement-based quantum key distribution protocol
SO EUROPEAN PHYSICAL JOURNAL PLUS
AB Since the 80 s when it was first proposed, Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) elicited great interest in the field of cryptography as a unique procedure for key generation that could in principle guarantee unconditionally secure communication "by the laws of Physics". In the last fifteen years commercial solutions have started appearing on the market, showing that practical implementations of the protocol were not only possible but also competitive in terms of security and achievable secret-key rate. In this work we describe a simulation of the historical QKD protocol E91 on the IBM Quantum platform, making use of the qubit formalism to represent the quantum states received by two communicating nodes. Having implemented also the post-processing steps for the error correction and the privacy amplification, this model can represent a simple stand-alone tool to study the performance not only of one-to-one communication but of more complex systems that rely on QKD for security, one above all QKD networks.

TI Design Space Exploration of Hybrid Quantum-Classical Neural Networks
SO ELECTRONICS
AB The unprecedented success of classical neural networks and the recent advances in quantum computing have motivated the research community to explore the interplay between these two technologies, leading to the so-called quantum neural networks. In fact, universal quantum computers are anticipated to both speed up and improve the accuracy of neural networks. However, whether such quantum neural networks will result in a clear advantage on noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices is still not clear. In this paper, we propose a systematic methodology for designing quantum layer(s) in hybrid quantum-classical neural network (HQCNN) architectures. Following our proposed methodology, we develop different variants of hybrid neural networks and compare them with pure classical architectures of equivalent size. Finally, we empirically evaluate our proposed hybrid variants and show that the addition of quantum layers does provide a noticeable computational advantage.

TI Enhancing the performance of variational quantum classifiers with hybrid
   autoencoders
SO QUANTUM INFORMATION PROCESSING
AB Variational quantum circuits (VQC) lie at the forefront of quantum machine learning research. Still, the use of quantum networks for real data processing remains challenging as the number of available qubits cannot accommodate a large dimensionality of data-if the usual angle encoding scenario is used. To achieve dimensionality reduction, Principal Component Analysis is routinely applied as a pre-processing method before the embedding of the classical features on qubits. In this work, we propose an alternative method which reduces the dimensionality of a given dataset by taking into account the specific quantum embedding that comes after. This method aspires to make quantum machine learning with VQCs more versatile and effective on datasets of high dimension. At a second step, we propose a quantum-inspired classical autoencoder model which can be used to encode information in low latent spaces. The power of our proposed models is exhibited via numerical tests. We show that our targeted dimensionality reduction method considerably boosts VQC's performance, and we also identify cases for which the second model outperforms classical autoencoders in terms of reconstruction loss.

Furthermore, a detailed analysis is presented regarding the impact of decohering channels on thermal LQU. This controllable LQU in engineering applications can disclose the advantage enabled in the superconducting charge qubits for designing quantum computers and quantum batteries.

TI From classical to quantum information geometry: a guide for physicists
SO NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB Recently, there has been considerable interest in the application of information geometry to quantum many body physics. This interest has been driven by three separate lines of research, which can all be understood as different facets of quantum information geometry. First, the study of topological phases of matter characterized by Chern number is rooted in the symplectic structure of the quantum state space, known in the physics literature as Berry curvature. Second, in the study of quantum phase transitions, the fidelity susceptibility has gained prominence as a universal probe of quantum criticality, even for systems that lack an obviously discernible order parameter. Finally, the study of quantum Fisher information in many body systems has seen a surge of interest due to its role as a witness of genuine multipartite entanglement and owing to its utility as a quantifier of quantum resources, in particular those useful in quantum sensing. Rather than a thorough review, our aim is to connect key results within a common conceptual framework that may serve as an introductory guide to the extensive breadth of applications, and deep mathematical roots, of quantum information geometry, with an intended audience of researchers in quantum many body and condensed matter physics.

AB Emerging quantum technologies hold the promise of unravelling difficult problems ranging from condensed matter to high-energy physics while, at the same time, motivating the search for unprecedented phenomena in their setting. Here, we use a custom-built superconducting qubit ladder to realize non-thermalizing states with rich entanglement structures in the middle of the energy spectrum. Despite effectively forming an "infinite" temperature ensemble, these states robustly encode quantum information far from equilibrium, as we demonstrate by measuring the fidelity and entanglement entropy in the quench dynamics of the ladder. Our approach harnesses the recently proposed type of non-ergodic behavior known as "rainbow scar," which allows us to obtain analytically exact eigenfunctions whose ergodicity-breaking properties can be conveniently controlled by randomizing the couplings of the model without affecting their energy. The on-demand tunability of quantum correlations via disorder allows for in situ control over ergodicity breaking, and it provides a knob for designing exotic many-body states that defy thermalization.

TI Low-loss interconnects for modular superconducting quantum processors
SO NATURE ELECTRONICS
AB Low-loss superconducting aluminium cables and on-chip impedance transformers can be used to link qubit modules and create superconducting quantum computing networks with high-fidelity intermodule state transfer.
   Scaling is now a key challenge in superconducting quantum computing. One solution is to build modular systems in which smaller-scale quantum modules are individually constructed and calibrated and then assembled into a larger architecture. This, however, requires the development of suitable interconnects. Here we report low-loss interconnects based on pure aluminium coaxial cables and on-chip impedance transformers featuring quality factors of up to 8.1 x 10(5), which is comparable with the performance of our transmon qubits fabricated on a single-crystal sapphire substrate. We use these interconnects to link five quantum modules with intermodule quantum state transfer and Bell state fidelities of up to 99%. To benchmark the overall performance of the processor, we create maximally entangled, multiqubit Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger states. The generated intermodule four-qubit Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger state exhibits 92.0% fidelity. We also entangle up to 12 qubits in a Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger state with 55.8 +/- 1.8% fidelity, which is above the genuine multipartite entanglement threshold of 1/2.

TI Design and implementation of a polarization-encoding system for quantum
   key distribution
SO JOURNAL OF OPTICS
AB We present the design and implementation of a state-of-polarization (SOP) management technique and two efficient synchronizing methods for quantum key distribution (QKD) systems. This is achieved following a wavelength-division multiplexing approach, where the classical synchronization signal and the quantum states are propagated in the same optical fiber. The employed frame synchronization method is based on the monitoring of the quantum bit error ratio (QBER) of the quantum channel, thus avoiding additional hardware and high computational resources. We evaluate the operation of SOP generation method through the assessment of the individual response of the waveplates that comprise the employed electronic polarization controller. Finally, the performance was assessed by computing the overall QBER and the QBER contributions of each of the four polarization states associated with the different qubits. The measurements, obtained during six hours, show a slight variation of the QBER values associated with the individual contributions, reaching an overall QBER of 0.75%. This demonstrates the capability of the presented methods to operate, stably, with very low QBER values, making its application in practical QKD systems reliable.

TI Decoding general error correcting codes and the role of complementarity
SO NPJ QUANTUM INFORMATION
AB Among various classes of quantum error correcting codes (QECCs), non-stabilizer codes have rich properties and are of theoretical and practical interest. Decoding non-stabilizer codes is, however, a highly non-trivial task. In this paper, we show that a decoding circuit for Calderbank-Shor-Steane (CSS) codes can be straightforwardly extended to handle general QECCs. The key to the extension lies in the use of a pair of classical-quantum (CQ) codes associated with the QECC to be decoded. The decoding error of the proposed decoding circuit depends on the classical decoding errors of the CQ codes and their degree of complementarity. We demonstrate the power of the decoding circuit in a toy model of the black hole information paradox, improving decoding errors compared to previous results. In addition, we reveal that black hole dynamics may optimally encode quantum information but poorly encode classical information.

TI A comprehensive study on a tapered Paul trap: from design to potential
   applications
SO QUANTUM SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB We present a tapered Paul trap whose radio frequency electrodes are inclined to the symmetric axis of the endcap electrodes, resulting in a funnel-shaped trapping potential. With this configuration, a charged particle confined in this trap has its radial degrees of freedom coupled to that of the axial direction. The same design was successfully used to experimentally realize a single-atom heat engine, and with this setup amplification of zeptonewton forces was implemented. In this paper, we show the design, implementation, and characterization of such an ion trap in detail. This system offers a high level of control over the ion's motion. Its novel features promise applications in the field of quantum thermodynamics, quantum sensing, and quantum information.

SO JOURNAL OF ALLOYS AND COMPOUNDS

Electron spin resonance (ESR) measurements of the spinel and hexagonal ferrite NPs have been performed by a high sensitive conventional x.band (similar to 9.5-9.8 GHz) spectrometer at room temperature (RT). The measured five small g-values by ESR spectra at RT may be relevant for quantum information processing. Quantum computing and relativistic quantum computing by two-level system (qubit) have been realized by spinel type NPs at RT. Temperature evolution of magnetic hysteresis loops, magnetization, coercivity (H-C), saturation field (H-S), saturation magnetization (M-S) and remanent magnetization (M-r) have been investigated.

TI Compact polarization-entangled photon source based on coexisting
   noncritically birefringent and quasi phase matching in a nonlinear
   crystal
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB Polarization-entangled photons are indispensable to numerous quantum technologies and fundamental studies. In this paper, we propose and demonstrate what we believe to be a novel source that generates collinear polarization-entangled photons by simultaneously achieving two distinct types of phase-matching conditions (noncritically birefringent and quasi phase matching) in a periodically poled nonlinear crystal with a large poling period of 2 mm. The photon pairs are generated in a polarization-entangled state with a fidelity and concurrence of 0.998 and 0.935, respectively, and violate the Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt inequality by 84 standard deviations. The compact source does not require interferometer, delicate domain structures, or post selection, and is advantageous for scalable quantum computing and communication, where many replicas or chip-scale devices are needed.

TI Extended version: enabling lattice-based post-quantum cryptography on
   the opentitan platform
SO JOURNAL OF CRYPTOGRAPHIC ENGINEERING
AB The first generation of post-quantum cryptography (PQC) standards by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) is just around the corner. The need for secure implementations is therefore increasing. In this work, we address this need and investigate the integration of lattice-based PQC into an open-source silicon root of trust (RoT), the OpenTitan. RoTs are important security building blocks that need to be future-proofed with PQC. The OpenTitan features multiple cryptographic hardware accelerators and countermeasures against physical attacks, but does not offer dedicated support for lattice-based PQC. Thus, we propose instruction set extensions for the OpenTitan Big Number Accelerator (OTBN) to improve the efficiency of polynomial arithmetic and sampling. As a case study we analyze the performance of signature verification of the digital signature schemes Dilithium and Falcon. Our implementation verifies signatures within 911,366 cycles for Dilithium-II and 759,779 cycles for Falcon-512, pushing this RoT functionality below 10 ms for the OpenTitan's target frequency of 100 MHz. In case of Dilithium-II, this can not be achieved without these hardware extensions, even for advanced implementation techniques such as Kronecker+. With an overhead of 437,665.00 kGE, our hardware extensions make up only about 2.93 % of the total RoT area. All our extensions integrate seamlessly with countermeasures against physical attacks which are already available within the OTBN and comply with the adversary model chosen by the OpenTitan project.

TI Quasiprobability fluctuation theorem behind the spread of quantum
   information
SO COMMUNICATIONS PHYSICS
AB Information spreads in time. For example, correlations dissipate when the correlated system locally couples to a third party, such as the environment. This simple but important fact forms the known quantum data-processing inequality. Here we theoretically uncover the quantum fluctuation theorem behind the quantum informational inequality. The fluctuation theorem quantitatively predicts the statistics of the underlying stochastic quantum process. To fully capture the quantum nature, the fluctuation theorem established here is extended to the quasiprobability regime. We also experimentally apply an interference-based method to measure the amplitudes composing the quasiprobability and verify our established fluctuation theorem by the IBM quantum computer.
   With the increase of the use of quantum information in everyday life, its dynamics requires deeper understanding. Here, the quantum fluctuation theorem, that accounts for a quantum system interacting with the environment, is established within the framework of quasi-probability, a powerful tool for studying quantum statistics.

TI Quantum annealing with trigger Hamiltonians: Application to

SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB We study the performance of quantum annealing for two sets of problems, namely, 2-satisfiability (2-SAT) problems represented by Ising-type Hamiltonians and nonstoquastic problems which are obtained by adding extra couplings to the 2-SAT problem Hamiltonians. In addition, we add to the transverse Ising-type Hamiltonian used for quantum annealing a third term, the trigger Hamiltonian with ferromagnetic or antiferromagnetic couplings, which vanishes at the beginning and end of the annealing process. We also analyze some problem instances using the energy spectrum, average energy or overlap of the state during the evolution with the instantaneous low-lying eigenstates of the Hamiltonian, and identify some nonadiabatic mechanisms which can enhance the performance of quantum annealing.

TI Matrix-Model Simulations Using Quantum Computing, Deep Learning, and
   Lattice Monte Carlo
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB Matrix quantum mechanics plays various important roles in theoretical physics, such as a holographic description of quantum black holes, and it underpins the only practical numerical approach to the study of complex high-dimensional supergravity theories. Understanding quantum black holes and the role of entanglement in a holographic setup is of paramount importance for the realization of a quantum theory of gravity. Moreover, a complete numerical understanding of the holographic duality and the emergence of geometric space-time features from microscopic degrees of freedom could pave the way for new discoveries in quantum information science. Euclidean lattice Monte Carlo simulations are the de facto numerical tool for understanding the spectrum of large matrix models and have been used to test the holographic duality. However, they are not tailored to extract dynamical properties or even the quantum wave function of the ground state of matrix models. Quantum computing and deep learning provide potentially useful approaches to study the dynamics of matrix quantum mechanics. If successful in the context of matrix models, these rapidly improving numerical techniques could become the new Swiss army knife of quantum gravity practitioners. In this paper, we perform the first systematic survey for quantum computing and deep-learning approaches to matrix quantum mechanics, comparing them to lattice Monte Carlo simulations. These provide baseline benchmarks before addressing more complicated problems. In particular, we test the performance of each method by calculating the low-energy spectrum.

TI Quantum Fourier Transform-Based Adaptive Image Compression and
   Transmission System
SO ELECTRONICS LETTERS
AB This study proposes an adaptive quantum Fourier transform (QFT)-based framework for efficient, high-quality near-lossless image compression and transmission. The system converts the input image into a bitstream, applies channel encoding, and maps it to quantum states. A key innovation is the dynamic selection of the qubit encoding size based on real-time channel conditions, optimizing the trade-off between compression efficiency and noise resilience. The proposed QFT framework selectively transmits a subset of coefficients through the noisy quantum channel. At the receiver, the full quantum state is estimated, followed by inverse QFT and channel decoding to reconstruct the original image. Compared to fixed-qubit methods, the proposed system achieves superior performance, with compression ratios of up to 256:1 and near-perfect reconstruction quality (PSNR approaching infinity and SSIM of 1). These results demonstrate its potential for future quantum communication applications.

TI Impact of imperfect measurements on multi-party quantum key distribution
SO RESULTS IN PHYSICS
AB The imperfection of measurements in real-world scenarios can compromise the performance of device-independent quantum key distribution (DIQKD) protocols. In this paper, we focus on a specific DIQKD protocol that relies on the violation of the Svetlichny's inequality (SI), considering an eavesdropper utilizing the convex combination attack. Our analysis covers both the three-party DIQKD case and the general n-party scenario. Our main result is the relationship between the measurement accuracy and the extractable secret-key rate in all multi-party scenarios. The result demonstrates that as measurement accuracy improves, the extractable secret-key rate approaches 1, reaching its maximum value when the measurement accuracy is perfect. We reveal that achieving positive extractable secret-key rates requires a threshold measurement accuracy that is consistently higher than the critical measurement accuracy necessary to violate the SI. We depict these thresholds for n-party scenarios ranging from n = 3 to n = 10, demonstrating that as the number of parties (n) increases, both thresholds exhibit a rapid and monotonic convergence towards unity. Furthermore, we consider a scenario involving a non-maximally entangled state with imperfect measurements, where the emission of the initial GHZ state undergoes noise during transmission, resulting in a Werner state. The study further quantifies and demonstrates the relationship between the extractable secret-key rate, the visibility of the Werner state, and the measurement accuracy, specifically emphasizing the three-party scenario. This study aims to illuminate the influence of imperfect measurement accuracy on the security and performance of multi-party DIQKD protocols. The results emphasize the importance of high measurement accuracy in achieving positive secret-key rates and maintaining the violation of the SI.

AB Recent advancements in quantum technology have created an urgent need for skilled professionals in this field, necessitating innovative educational approaches. This systematic literature review investigates the integration of Extended Reality (XR), including Virtual and Augmented Reality, in quantum technology education. We analyzed 19 shortlisted articles from major digital libraries using comprehensive methodologies, including refined search strings, rigorous inclusion and exclusion criteria as well as manual filtering. Our analysis highlights the application of XR technology across various quantum disciplines, predominantly quantum computing and quantum chemistry, at different educational levels, with a focus on university-level education. Notably, our review reveals a dominance of design-development research, a scarcity of empirical studies and a significant absence of educational learning theories as foundational frameworks. Additionally, we identify critical gaps in the current research landscape, including limited focus on immersive design elements and learner engagement strategies. The findings point towards emerging opportunities for future research, emphasizing the need for more empirical studies, intervention features and a holistic integration of educational learning theories. This review serves as a roadmap for advancing XR-based quantum education, fostering innovative research directions and shaping effective teaching practices.

TI Quantum algorithm for unstructured search of ranked targets
SO PHYSICA SCRIPTA
AB Grover's quantum algorithm can find a marked item from an unstructured database faster than any classical algorithm, and hence it has been used for several applications such as cryptanalysis and optimization. When there exist multiple marked items, Grover's algorithm has the property of finding one of them uniformly at random. To further broaden the application range, it was generalized so that it finds marked items with probabilities according to their priority by encoding the priority into amplitudes applied by Grover's oracle operator. In this paper, to achieve a similar generalization, we examine a different encoding that incorporates the priority into phases applied by the oracle operator. We compare the previous and our oracle operators and observe that which one performs better depends on priority parameters. Since the priority parameters can be considered as the magnitude of the correlated phase error on Grover's oracle operator, the analysis of our oracle operator also reveals the robustness of the original Grover's algorithm against correlated noises. We further numerically show that the coherence between multiple marked items tends to increase the probability of finding the most prioritized one in Grover's algorithm with our oracle operator.

TI Grover's algorithm in a four-qubit silicon processor above the
   fault-tolerant threshold
SO NATURE NANOTECHNOLOGY
AB Spin qubits in silicon are strong contenders for the realization of a practical quantum computer. Single- and two-qubit gates have shown fidelities above the fault-tolerant threshold, and entanglement of three qubits has been achieved. Furthermore, high-fidelity operation of two-qubit algorithms is possible. Here we implement a four-qubit silicon processor with all control fidelities above the fault-tolerant threshold. We demonstrate a three-qubit Grover's search algorithm with a similar to 95% probability of finding the marked state. To this end, we fabricate the processor from three phosphorus atoms precision-patterned into isotopically pure silicon. We define three phosphorus nuclear spin qubits and one electron spin qubit. The long coherence times of the qubits enable single-qubit fidelities above 99.9% for all qubits. Moreover, the efficient single-pulse multi-qubit operation enabled by the electron-nuclear hyperfine interaction facilitates controlled-Z gates with above 99% fidelity between all pairs of nuclear spins when using the electron as an ancilla. These control fidelities, combined with high-fidelity non-demolition readout of all nuclear spins, allows the creation of a three-qubit Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger state with 96.2% fidelity. Looking ahead, coupling neighbouring nuclear spin registers, as the one shown here, via electron-electron exchange may enable larger, yet fault-tolerant, quantum processors.

TI The dynamics of the bipartite and tripartite entanglement in the
   three-qubit Dicke model
SO ACTA PHYSICA SINICA
AB We study the entanglement dynamics of the three-qubit Dicke model by means of the adiabatic approximation and the exact diagonalization in the parameter regime where the qubit transition frequencies are far off-resonance with the radiation field and the interaction strengths reach the ultrastrong-coupling regime. The single-mode field is prepared in the coherent state and two typical states GHZ and W are chosen as the initial three-qubit states. In the process of evolution, the interaction between the quantized field and three-qubit system leads to the generation of entanglement between the field and qubits, as well as between different parties in the three-qubit system, i.e. the pairwise entanglement of two qubits and the tripartite entanglement, which are of ongoing interest in quantum information process. The generalized concurrence and negativity are adopted to quantify different kinds of entanglement. The qubit-field entanglement never reaches the maximum and no sudden death occurs in the the tripartite entanglement for GHZ state, but it is exactly the opposite for W state. This reflects that the tripartite entanglement of the GHZ state is more robust than W sate, which is the same as in the rotating wave approximation. The results beyond the rotating wave approximation show that the pairwise entanglement gradually decreases and vanishes in the evolution of both initial states, with the tripartite entanglement periodically reaching relatively high level. This means that the interaction in system supports the tripartite entanglement at the cost of pairwise entanglement. The conclusions provide theoretical reference for the robustness of entanglement state and quantum information processing using Dicke model.

TI Quantum walks of two correlated photons in a 2D synthetic lattice
SO NPJ QUANTUM INFORMATION
AB Quantum walks represent paradigmatic quantum evolutions, enabling powerful applications in the context of topological physics and quantum computation. They have been implemented in diverse photonic architectures, but the realization of two-particle dynamics on a multidimensional lattice has hitherto been limited to continuous-time evolutions. To fully exploit the computational capabilities of quantum interference it is crucial to develop platforms handling multiple photons that propagate across multidimensional lattices. Here, we report a discrete-time quantum walk of two correlated photons in a two-dimensional lattice, synthetically engineered by manipulating a set of optical modes carrying quantized amounts of transverse momentum. Mode-couplings are introduced via the polarization-controlled diffractive action of thin geometric-phase optical elements. The entire platform is compact, efficient, scalable, and represents a versatile tool to simulate quantum evolutions on complex lattices. We expect that it will have a strong impact on diverse fields such as quantum state engineering, topological quantum photonics, and Boson Sampling.

TI Quantum Tensor DBMS and Quantum Gantt Charts: Towards Exponentially
   Faster Earth Data Engineering
SO EARTH
AB Earth data is essential for global environmental studies. Many Earth data types are naturally modeled by multidimensional arrays (tensors). Array (Tensor) DBMSs strive to be the best systems for tensor-related workloads and can be especially helpful for Earth data engineering, which takes up to 80% of Earth data science. We present a new quantum Array (Tensor) DBMS data model and new quantum approaches that rely on the upcoming quantum memory and demonstrate exponential speedups when applied to many of the toughest Array (Tensor) DBMS challenges stipulated by classical computing and real-world Earth data use-cases. We also propose new types of charts: Quantum Gantt (QGantt) Charts and Quantum Network Diagrams (QND). QGantt charts clearly illustrate how multiple operations occur simultaneously across different data items and what are the input/output data dependencies between these operations. Unlike traditional Gantt charts, which typically track project timelines and resources, QGantt charts integrate specific data items and operations over time. A Quantum Network Diagram combines several QGantt charts to show dependencies between multistage operations, including their inputs/outputs. By using a static format, QGantt charts and Quantum Network Diagrams allow users to explore complex processes at their own pace, which can be beneficial for educational and R&D purposes.

AB As the demand for high-performance and dynamically adaptable network services continues to grow, the convergence of quantum computing and network orchestration represents a promising development. This paper explores the transformative potential of quantum computing in the orchestration of network services and introduces new paradigms that transcend classical limitations. Using a case study, we propose a workflow for an exemplary link failure process for generative AI (GenAI) and quantum computing-based service orchestration in an edge cloud (EC) network. Later, we address the challenges of integrating services based on quantum computing (using a quantum search algorithm to select the best connections) with GenAI-based topology control and management in an orchestration framework. Our work also introduces multi-solution quantum search for orchestrating services across different edge clouds, emphasizing efficiency and accuracy. Algorithmic considerations, including the impact of the oracle and hybrid approaches, are also thoroughly explored. We conclude the paper with potentials and comparisons of possible GenAI techniques and quantum search algorithms in terms of their advantages and disadvantages.

TI Experimental aspects of indefinite causal order in quantum mechanics
SO NATURE REVIEWS PHYSICS
AB In the past decade, the toolkit of quantum information has been expanded to include processes in which the basic operations do not have definite causal relations. Originally considered in the context of the unification of quantum mechanics and general relativity, these causally indefinite processes have been shown to offer advantages in a wide variety of quantum-information processing tasks, ranging from quantum computation to quantum metrology. Here, we overview these advantages and the experimental efforts to realize them. We survey both the experimental techniques employed and the theoretical methods developed in support of the experiments, before discussing the interpretations of current experimental results and giving an outlook on the future of the field.
   Quantum superpositions of orders of operations can be used to create an indefinite causal order. This Review covers experimental implementations of such processes, focusing on characterization techniques, and discusses their applications and limitations.
   An indefinite causal order (ICO) is a situation wherein the order of different events or operations is placed in a quantum superposition. Thus one cannot ascribe a definite order to these operations.The best-studied process with an ICO is the quantum switch, which applies a set of quantum gates in a superposition of all possible permutations. The quantum switch has been experimentally implemented using various degrees of freedom encoded in single photons.There is a strong analogy between processes with an ICO and entangled states. This analogy can be used to design techniques to certify ICO.The quantum switch can be used to achieve advantages that go beyond devices that can be described by the quantum circuit model. Although there is no general computational advantage from the quantum switch, there are many specific applications, including quantum computation protocols, quantum communication, quantum metrology and even quantum thermodynamics.

AB A key challenge when writing quantum programs is the need for uncomputation: temporary values produced during the computation must be reset to zero before they can be safely discarded. Unfortunately, most existing quantum languages require tedious manual uncomputation, often leading to inefficient and error-prone programs.
   We present Unqomp, the first procedure to automatically synthesize uncomputation in a given quantum circuit. Unqomp can be readily integrated into popular quantum languages, allowing the programmer to allocate and use temporary values analogously to classical computation, knowing they will be uncomputed by Unqomp.
   Our evaluation shows that programs leveraging Unqomp are not only shorter (-19% on average), but also generatemore efficient circuits (-71% gates and -19% qubits on average).

TI Energy requirement for implementing unitary gates on energy-unbounded
   systems
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICS A-MATHEMATICAL AND THEORETICAL
AB The processing of quantum information always has a cost in terms of physical resources such as energy or time. Determining the resource requirements is not only an indispensable step in the design of practical devices-the resources need to be actually provided-but may also yield fundamental constraints on the class of processes that are physically possible. Here we study how much energy is required to implement a desired unitary gate on a quantum system with a non-trivial energy spectrum. We derive a general lower bound on the energy requirement, extending the main result of Chiribella et al (2021 Phys. Rev. X 11 021014) from finite dimensional systems to systems with unbounded Hamiltonians. Such an extension has immediate applications in quantum information processing with optical systems, and allows us to provide bounds on the energy requirement of continuous variable quantum gates, such as displacement and squeezing gates.

AB COVID-19 is an airborne virus that can be spread directly or indirectly from one person to another. Spreading the virus strongly depends on the location and time and hence, a Spatio-temporal event. Moreover, traffic congestion will increase the spread of the virus not only because of the vicinity but also because of increased temperature and humidity in these spaces for a short or long time. This paper introduces a vehicle routing optimization model to reduce COVID-19 exposure risk during a city journey by solving it as a quadratic unconstrained binary optimization problem on a quantum annealing computer. Indeed, the objective of the COVID-19 prevention optimization problem is to minimize the risk of exposure for a given set of road users between origins and destinations. Microsoft Taxi data from the city of Beijing have been used to simulate road users' movement. The problem has been run onto three different solvers. One of the solvers is executed on classical computers, and two other solvers are executed on hybrid quantum solvers. Hybrid solvers return the solution within less than 0.03 seconds on quantum processing unit time. However, the results will be returned at least 5 seconds after the execution in the classical solver. It is worth mentioning that, as there is no direct access to the quantum computers, it is hard to compare the results on the same scale as the queries will go on a queue in D-wave quantum computers. Applying the proposed model on the trajectory data shows a better distribution of the vehicles on the road network.

AB The current generation of noisy intermediate-scale quantum computers introduces new opportunities to study quantum many-body systems. In this paper, we show that quantum circuits can provide a dramatically more efficient representation than current classical numerics of the quantum states generated under nonequilibrium quantum dynamics. For quantum circuits, we perform both real- and imaginary-time evolution using an optimization algorithm that is feasible on near-term quantum computers. We benchmark the algorithms by finding the ground state and simulating a global quench of the transverse-field Ising model with a longitudinal field on a classical computer. Furthermore, we implement (classically optimized) gates on a quantum processing unit and demonstrate that our algorithm effectively captures real-time evolution.

TI Quantum tangent kernel
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB The quantum kernel method is one of the key approaches to quantum machine learning, which has the advantage of not requiring optimization and its theoretical simplicity. By virtue of these properties, several experimental demonstrations and discussions of the potential advantages have been developed so far. However, as is the case in classical machine learning, not all quantum machine learning models could be regarded as kernel methods. In this work, we explore a quantum machine learning model with a deep parametrized quantum circuit and aim to go beyond the conventional quantum kernel method. In this case, the expressive power and performance are expected to be enhanced, while the training process might be a bottleneck because of the barren plateaus. Moreover, the high computational cost of gradient-based optimization and the large search space of the gradient-free optimization directly make the training intractable. However, we find that parameters of a deep enough quantum circuit do not move much from their initial values during training, allowing for a first-order expansion with respect to the parameters. This behavior is similar to that of the neural tangent kernel in classical machine learning, and such a quantum machine learning with deep variational quantum circuits can be described by another emergent kernel, the quantum tangent kernel. We show that the proposed quantum tangent kernel has the potential to outperform the conventional quantum kernel method by performing a classification task on an ansatz-generated dataset. This work provides a different direction beyond the conventional quantum kernel method and explores the potential power of quantum machine learning with deep parametrized quantum circuits.

TI Cavity QED photons for quantum information processing
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICS B-ATOMIC MOLECULAR AND OPTICAL PHYSICS
AB Based on a cavity QED framework, we theoretically describe a universal set of logic gates which are implemented by passing a multi-level atom initially in its ground state through a multi-mode cavity. The qubits are encoded on the cavity modes and the atom plays the role of an ancilla which will not be entangled with the final result of a gate operation. We apply the multiphoton resonance theory of Shore to develop effective two- and three-level Hamiltonians, so that the proper values for detunings, coupling coefficients, and interaction times for gate operations can be determined. This enables us to examine a faster iSWAP gate than our previous study and to examine numerically the effects of decoherence on both the iSWAP gate and our previously presented Fredkin gate which used the same multi-mode approach. We also present results that show how conditional measurements of the ancilla atom can improve gate fidelities in these cases.

TI Remote transport of high-dimensional orbital angular momentum states and

SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB The efficient transport and engineering of photonic orbital angular momentum (OAM) lie at the heart of various related classical and quantum applications. Here, by leveraging the spatial-mode-engineered frequency conversion, we realize the remote transport of high-dimensional orbital angular momentum (OAM) states between two distant parties without direct transmission of information carriers. We exploit perfect vortices for preparing high-dimensional yet maximal O AM entanglement. Based on nonlinear sum-frequency generation working with a strong coherent wave packet and a single photon, we conduct the Bell-like state measurements for high-dimensional perfect vortices. We experimentally achieve an average transport fidelity 0.879 +/- 0.048 and 0.796 +/- 0.066 for a complete set of 3-dimensional and 5-dimensional OAM mutually unbiased bases, respectively. Furthermore, by exploring the full transverse entanglement, we construct another strategy of quantum imaging with interaction-free light. It is expected that, with the future advances in nonlinear frequency conversion, our scheme will pave the way for realizing truly secure high-dimensional quantum teleportation in the upcoming quantum network.
   Remote transport of high-dimensional-encoded photonic states could in principle be achieved via quantum teleportation, but with considerable experimental effort. Here, instead, the authors exploit spatial-mode engineered frequency conversion between a coherent wave packet and a single photon to remotely transfer the HD OAM states, also providing a strategy for quantum imaging.

TI Entanglement detection and classification of multi-qubit GHZ state,
   WW(sic) state, and SGT state under one-axis twisting model
SO ACTA PHYSICA SINICA
AB Entanglement detection and classification of different kinds of entangled states in quantum many-body systems have always been a key topic in quantum information and quantum computation. In this work, we investigate the entanglement detection and classification of three special entangled states: 4-qubit GHZ state, 4-qubit WW(sic) state, and 4-qubit SGT state, which cannot be distinguished by the general quantum Fisher information (QFI) under the usual local operations. By utilizing the experimentally mature and controllable one-axis twisting model, along with optimized rotations and adjustable interaction strength, we successfully classify the three states by QFI. Additionally, we also study the effects of four types of environmental noise on entanglement detection, namely, bit-flip channel, amplitude-damping channel, phase-damping channel, and depolarizing channel. The results show that under local operations, the changes of the QFI from the 4-qubit GHZ state with decoherence parameter p in four noise channels are significantly different from those of the WW(sic) state and SGT state, and thus making them distinguished. However, the QFI about the WW(sic) state and the QFI about the SGT state exhibit the same variations and cannot be classified. In the one-axis twisting model, the variation curves of the QFI of the three states under the four noise channels are different from each other, which can be clearly observed. It should be noted that in the bit-flip channel, the QFI curves of the WW(sic) state and the SGT state overlaps in the middle region (p approximate to 0.5), which prevents their classification. Our work provides a new method for entanglement detection and classification in quantum many-body systems, which will contribute to future research in quantum science and technology.

TI Preparing low-variance states using a distributed quantum algorithm
SO QUANTUM
AB Quantum computers are a highly promising tool for efficiently simulating quantum many-body systems. The preparation of their eigenstates is of particular interest and can be addressed, e.g., by quantum phase estimation algorithms. The routine then acts as an effective filtering operation, reducing the energy variance of the initial state. In this work, we present a distributed quantum algorithm inspired by iterative phase estimation to prepare low-variance states. Our method uses a single auxiliary qubit per quantum device, which controls its dynamics, and a postselection strategy for a joint quantum measurement on such auxiliary qubits. In the multi-device case, the result of this measurement heralds the successful runs of the protocol. This allows us to demonstrate that our distributed algorithm reduces the energy variance faster compared to single-device implementations, thereby highlighting the potential of distributed algorithms for near-term and early fault-tolerant devices.

TI One-dimensional arrays of optical dark spot traps from nested Gaussian
   laser beams for quantum computing
SO APPLIED PHYSICS B-LASERS AND OPTICS
AB Quantum computing is rapidly becoming a practical technology, driven by new and advanced quantum systems, each with its own advantages and disadvantages. For neutral atoms as a host system, the natural advantage of long lifetimes is limited by decoherence mechanisms like light scattering. In this work, we computationally investigate a blue-detuned one-dimensional optical dipole trap array to reduce light scattering by holding atoms in minimum light intensity regions. The array consists of two counter-propagating Gaussian beams of differing widths, such that light walls from the larger beam radially confine the standing wave generating the dipole traps. We find this system is viable for neutral atom quantum computing and able to produce similar trap properties to the traditional red-detuned case, but with lower laser power. It also features added versatility from the tunable beam waist ratio, and the ability to reduce light scattering, by twenty times in one example we present. Generally, there is a tradeoff between the scattering rate and the number of viable traps formed. This design is promising for transporting atoms, as a complimentary technique to two- and three-dimensional trap arrays for storing atoms.

TI Quantum computing for chemical and biomolecular product design
SO CURRENT OPINION IN CHEMICAL ENGINEERING
AB Chemical process design has for long been benefiting from computer-aided methods and tools to develop new processes and services that can meet the needs of society. Chemical and biomolecular product design could also benefit from the use of computer-aided solution strategies and computational power to efficiently solve the problems at various scales as the complexity and size of problems grow. In this context, new modes of computation such as quantum computing are receiving increasing attention. While quantum computing has been in development for quite some time, the development of the technology to the point of making commercial use of such resources is quite recent, and still quite limited in scope. However, projections point to a rapid development of quantum computing resources becoming available to academia and industry, which opens potential application areas in chemical and biomolecular product design. With the advent of hybrid algorithms that are able to take advantage of both classical computing and quantum computing resources, as quantum computing grows, more and more problems relevant for chemical product design will become solvable. In this paper, some perspectives are given by identifying a set of needs and challenges for a selected set of opportunities, such as quantum chemistry-based property prediction, protein folding, complex multi-step chemical reactions, and molecular reaction dynamics.

TI Anomalously slow dynamics of inhomogeneous quantum annealing
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Inhomogeneous quantum annealing (IQA), in which transverse fields are turned off one by one rather than simultaneously, has been proposed as an effective way to avoid the first-order phase transitions that impede conventional quantum annealing (QA). Here we explicitly study the dynamics of IQA, rather than merely the thermodynamics, and find that it is appreciably slower than the phase diagram would suggest. Interestingly, this slowdown manifests both when IQA succeeds in circumventing phase transitions and when it fails. Even in the absence of transitions, such as for the mean-field models that have been analyzed previously, IQA is slower than expected by a factor of the number of spins N. More significantly, we show that in non-mean-field models, first-order transitions are likely to be quite common, and the gap at such transitions is not merely exponential in N but exactly zero. Thus IQA cannot reach the ground state on any timescale. Both of these results can be understood through the simple observation that a spin's magnetization becomes conserved once its field is turned off during the IQA protocol.

TI Training neural networks with universal adiabatic quantum computing
SO FRONTIERS IN ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE
AB The training of neural networks (NNs) is a computationally intensive task requiring significant time and resources. This article presents a novel approach to NN training using adiabatic quantum computing (AQC), a paradigm that leverages the principles of adiabatic evolution to solve optimization problems. We propose a universal AQC method that can be implemented on gate quantum computers, allowing for a broad range of Hamiltonians and thus enabling the training of expressive neural networks. We apply this approach to various neural networks with continuous, discrete, and binary weights. The study results indicate that AQC can very efficiently evaluate the global minimum of the loss function, offering a promising alternative to classical training methods.

TI Solving systems of Boolean multivariate equations with quantum annealing
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Polynomial systems over the binary field have important applications, especially in symmetric and asymmetric cryptanalysis, multivariate-based postquantum cryptography, coding theory, and computer algebra. In this paper, we study the quantum annealing model for solving Boolean systems of multivariate equations of degree 2, usually referred to as the multivariate quadratic problem. We present different methodologies to embed the problem into a Hamiltonian that can be solved by available quantum annealing platforms. In particular, we provide three embedding options, and we highlight their differences in terms of quantum resources. Moreover, we design a machine-agnostic algorithm that adopts an iterative approach to better solve the problem Hamiltonian by repeatedly reducing the search space. Finally, we use D-Wave devices to successfully implement our methodologies on several instances of the multivariate quadratic problem.

TI Gaussian Conversion Protocols for Cubic Phase State Generation
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB Universal quantum computing with continuous variables requires non-Gaussian resources, in addition to a Gaussian set of operations. A known resource enabling universal quantum computation is the cubic phase state, a non-Gaussian state whose experimental implementation has so far remained elusive. In this paper, we introduce two Gaussian conversion protocols that allow for the conversion of a non-Gaussian state that has been achieved experimentally, namely the trisqueezed state [Chang et al., Phys. Rev. X 10, 011011 (2020)], to a cubic phase state. The first protocol is deterministic and it involves active (inline) squeezing, achieving large fidelities that saturate the bound for deterministic Gaussian protocols. The second protocol is probabilistic and it involves an auxiliary squeezed state, thus removing the necessity of inline squeezing but still maintaining significant success probabilities and fidelities even larger than for the deterministic case. The success of these protocols provides strong evidence for using trisqueezed states as resources for universal quantum computation.

TI Single-Spin Readout and Quantum Sensing Using Optomechanically Induced
   Transparency
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB Solid-state spin defects are promising quantum sensors for a large variety of sensing targets. Some of these defects couple appreciably to strain in the host material. We propose to use this strain coupling for mechanically mediated dispersive single-shot spin readout by an optomechanically induced transparency measurement. Surprisingly, the estimated measurement times for negatively charged silicon-vacancy defects in diamond are an order of magnitude shorter than those for single-shot optical fluorescence readout. Our scheme can also be used for general parameter-estimation metrology and offers a higher sensitivity than conventional schemes using continuous position detection.

TI Quantum simulation of spin-boson models with structured bath
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB The spin-boson model, involving spins interacting with a bath of quantum harmonic oscillators, is a widely used representation of open quantum systems that describe many dissipative processes in physical, chemical and biological systems. Trapped ions present an ideal platform for simulating the quantum dynamics of such models, by accessing both the high-quality internal qubit states and the motional modes of the ions for spins and bosons, respectively. We demonstrate a fully programmable method to simulate dissipative dynamics of spin-boson models using a chain of trapped ions, where the initial temperature and the spectral densities of the boson bath are engineered by controlling the state of the motional modes and their coupling with qubit states. Our method provides a versatile and precise experimental tool for studying open quantum systems.

TI Spectral Multiplexing of Rare-Earth Emitters in a Co-Doped Crystalline
   Membrane
SO ADVANCED OPTICAL MATERIALS
AB The spectral addressing of many individual rare-earth dopants in optical resonators offers great potential for realizing distributed quantum information processors. To this end, it is required to understand and control the spectral properties of the emitters in micron-scale devices. Here, erbium emitters are investigated in a Fabry-Perot resonator that contains a 10 mu m thin membrane of crystalline yttrium orthosilicate that is co-doped with europium. The co-doping allows for tailoring the inhomogeneous distribution of the emitter frequency. With this approach, more than 360 spectrally resolved emitters are observed with Purcell factors exceeding 35, each of which constitutes an individually addressable qubit within the micron-scale resonator. In addition to this spectral multiplexing, the optical coherence is preserved up to 0.62(3) ms under dynamical decoupling. Without decoupling, the coherence still reaches the lifetime limit for the emitters with the strongest Purcell enhancement that leads up to a 110-fold lifetime reduction, down to 0.104(9) ms. Future work may combine this with long-lived nuclear spin memories, which makes the investigated co-doped membranes a promising platform for quantum repeaters and distributed quantum computers.

We show that every two-qubit, and some three and four-qubit OPBs can be locally distinguished. It turns out that the remaining three and four-qubit OPBs cannot be locally distinguished, and thus they show the quantum nonlocality without entanglement. We also distinguish them by merging some systems using quantum teleportation with assisted Bell states.

SO EPJ QUANTUM TECHNOLOGY
AB We extend the qubit-efficient encoding presented in (Tan et al. in Quantum 5:454, 2021) and apply it to instances of the financial transaction settlement problem constructed from data provided by a regulated financial exchange. Our methods are directly applicable to any QUBO problem with linear inequality constraints. Our extension of previously proposed methods consists of a simplification in varying the number of qubits used to encode correlations as well as a new class of variational circuits which incorporate symmetries thereby reducing sampling overhead, improving numerical stability and recovering the expression of the cost objective as a Hermitian observable. We also propose optimality-preserving methods to reduce variance in real-world data and substitute continuous slack variables. We benchmark our methods against standard QAOA for problems consisting of 16 transactions and obtain competitive results. Our newly proposed variational ansatz performs best overall. We demonstrate tackling problems with 128 transactions on real quantum hardware, exceeding previous results bounded by NISQ hardware by almost two orders of magnitude.

TI Extensive characterization and implementation of a family of three-qubit
   gates at the coherence limit
SO NPJ QUANTUM INFORMATION
AB While all quantum algorithms can be expressed in terms of single-qubit and two-qubit gates, more expressive gate sets can help reduce the algorithmic depth. This is important in the presence of gate errors, especially those due to decoherence. Using superconducting qubits, we have implemented a three-qubit gate by simultaneously applying two-qubit operations, thereby realizing a three-body interaction. This method straightforwardly extends to other quantum hardware architectures, requires only a firmware upgrade to implement, and is faster than its constituent two-qubit gates. The three-qubit gate represents an entire family of operations, creating flexibility in the quantum-circuit compilation. We demonstrate a process fidelity of 97.90%, which is near the coherence limit of our device. We then generate two classes of entangled states, the Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger and Dicke states, by applying the new gate only once; in comparison, decompositions into the standard gate set would have a two-qubit gate depth of two and three, respectively. Finally, we combine characterization methods and analyze the experimental and statistical errors in the fidelity of the gates and of the target states.

AB We present a new method for the verification of quantum circuits based on a novel symbolic representation of sets of quantum states using level-synchronized tree automata (LSTAs). LSTAs extend classical tree automata by labeling each transition with a set of choices, which are then used to synchronize subtrees of an accepted tree. Compared to the traditional tree automata, LSTAs have an incomparable expressive power while maintaining important properties, such as closure under union and intersection, and decidable language emptiness and inclusion. We have developed an efficient and fully automated symbolic verification algorithm for quantum circuits based on LSTAs. The complexity of supported gate operations is at most quadratic, dramatically improving the exponential worst-case complexity of an earlier tree automata-based approach. Furthermore, we show that LSTAs are a promising model for parameterized verification, i.e., verifying the correctness of families of circuits with the same structure for any number of qubits involved, which principally lies beyond the capabilities of previous automated approaches. We implemented this method as a C++ tool and compared it with three symbolic quantum circuit verifiers and two simulators on several benchmark examples. The results show that our approach can solve problems with sizes orders of magnitude larger than the state of the art.

TI Quantum algorithms for nonlinear partial differential equations
SO BULLETIN DES SCIENCES MATHEMATIQUES
AB Computations of nonlinear partial differential equations (PDEs) are some of the most important problems in science and engineering, but come with tremendous costs. Quantum algorithms have the potential to speed up these computations, but current methods are bound to weak or polynomial nonlinearity, short time of validity, or display no quantum advantage otherwise. We construct new quantum algorithms- based on level set methods - for Hamilton-Jacobi and scalar hyperbolic PDEs that generate algorithms with advantages with respect to critical numerical parameters, even for computing the physical observables. These algorithms hold for arbitrary nonlinearity for the equations under study and are valid globally in time . In addition, we also introduce a new quantum encoding, called level set encoding, that allows the efficient computation of physical observables. These PDEs are important for many applications like geometric optics, semi-classical limit of the Schr & ouml;dinger equations, and highfrequency limit of symmetric linear hyperbolic systems (for example the elastic wave and Maxwell equations). It can display up to exponential advantage -depending on the initial conditions and domain of the relevant observables- in both the dimension of the PDE and the error in computing its observables with respect to classical finite difference methods for these PDEs. Compared to classical finite difference methods, our algorithm also has an advantage with respect to the number of initial data, which has potential important applications in Monte Carlo simulations and uncertainty quantification. For more general PDEs, while an advantage with respect to a very large number of initial data is possible, this is mostly unrealistic for problems of practical interest, and new methods are required.

TI Orders of magnitude increased accuracy for quantum many-body problems on
   quantum computers via an exact transcorrelated method
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Transcorrelated methods provide an efficient way of partially transferring the description of electronic correlations from the ground-state wave function directly into the underlying Hamiltonian. In particular, Dobrautz et al. [Phys. Rev. B 99, 075119 (2019)] have demonstrated that the use of momentum-space representation, combined with a nonunitary similarity transformation, results in a Hubbard Hamiltonian that possesses a significantly more "compact" ground-state wave function, dominated by a single Slater determinant. This compactness/single-reference character greatly facilitates electronic structure calculations. As a consequence, however, the Hamiltonian becomes non-Hermitian, posing problems for quantum algorithms based on the variational principle. We overcome these limitations with the Ansatz-based quantum imaginary-time evolution algorithm and apply the transcorrelated method in the context of digital quantum computing. We demonstrate that this approach enables up to four orders of magnitude more accurate and compact solutions in various instances of the Hubbard model at intermediate interaction strength (U/t = 4), enabling the use of shallower quantum circuits for wave-function Ansatzes. In addition, we propose a more efficient implementation of the quantum imaginary-time evolution algorithm in quantum circuits that is tailored to non-Hermitian problems. To validate our approach, we perform hardware experiments on the ibmq_lima quantum computer. Our work paves the way for the use of exact transcorrelated methods for the simulations of ab initio systems on quantum computers.

TI Semidefinite programming hierarchies for constrained bilinear
   optimization
SO MATHEMATICAL PROGRAMMING
AB We give asymptotically converging semidefinite programming hierarchies of outer bounds on bilinear programs of the form Tr[H(D circle times E)], maximized with respect to semidefinite constraints on D and E. Applied to the problem of approximate error correction in quantum information theory, this gives hierarchies of efficiently computable outer bounds on the success probability of approximate quantum error correction codes in any dimension. The first level of our hierarchies corresponds to a previously studied relaxation (Leung and Matthews in IEEE Trans Inf Theory 61(8):4486, 2015) and positive partial transpose constraints can be added to give a sufficient criterion for the exact convergence at a given level of the hierarchy. To quantify the worst case convergence speed of our sum-of-squares hierarchies, we derive novel quantum de Finetti theorems that allow imposing linear constraints on the approximating state. In particular, we give finite de Finetti theorems for quantum channels, quantifying closeness to the convex hull of product channels as well as closeness to local operations and classical forward communication assisted channels. As a special case this constitutes a finite version of Fuchs-Schack-Scudo's asymptotic de Finetti theorem for quantum channels. Finally, our proof methods answer a question of Brandao and Harrow (Proceedings of the forty-fourth annual ACM symposium on theory of computing, STOC'12, p 307, 2012) by improving the approximation factor of de Finetti theorems with no symmetry from O(d(k/2)) tp poly (d, k), where d denotes local dimension and k the number of copies.

TI Quantum-Resistant Cryptographic Primitives Using Modular Hash Learning
   Algorithms for Enhanced SCADA System Security
SO CMC-COMPUTERS MATERIALS & CONTINUA
AB As quantum computing continues to advance, traditional cryptographic methods are increasingly challenged, particularly when it comes to securing critical systems like Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) systems. These systems are essential for monitoring and controlling industrial operations, making their security paramount. A key threat arises from Shor's algorithm, a powerful quantum computing tool that can compromise current hash functions, leading to significant concerns about data integrity and confidentiality. To tackle these issues, this article introduces a novel Quantum-Resistant Hash Algorithm (QRHA) known as the Modular Hash Learning Algorithm (MHLA). This algorithm is meticulously crafted to withstand potential quantum attacks by incorporating advanced mathematical and algorithmic techniques, enhancing its overall security framework. Our research delves into the effectiveness of MHLA in defending against both traditional and quantum-based threats, with a particular emphasis on its resilience to Shor's algorithm. The findings from our study demonstrate that MHLA significantly enhances the security of SCADA systems in the context of quantum technology. By ensuring that sensitive data remains protected and confidential, MHLA not only fortifies individual systems but also contributes to the broader efforts of safeguarding industrial and infrastructure control systems against future quantum threats. Our evaluation demonstrates that MHLA improves security by 38% against quantum attack simulations compared to traditional hash functions while maintaining a computational efficiency of O(m & sdot; n & sdot; k + v + n). The algorithm achieved a 98% success rate in detecting data tampering during integrity testing. These findings underline MHLA's effectiveness in enhancing SCADA system security amidst evolving quantum technologies. This research represents a crucial step toward developing more secure cryptographic systems that can adapt to the rapidly changing technological landscape, ultimately ensuring the reliability and integrity of critical infrastructure in an era where quantum computing poses a growing risk.

TI Performance Improvement of Atmospheric Continuous-Variable Quantum Key
   Distribution with Untrusted Source
SO ENTROPY
AB Atmospheric continuous-variable quantum key distribution (ACVQKD) has been proven to be secure theoretically with the assumption that the signal source is well protected by the sender so that it cannot be compromised. However, this assumption is quite unpractical in realistic quantum communication system. In this work, we investigate a practical situation in which the signal source is no longer protected by the legitimate parts, but is exposed to the untrusted atmospheric channel. We show that the performance of ACVQKD is reduced by removing the assumption, especially when putting the untrusted source at the middle of the channel. To improve the performance of the ACVQKD with the untrusted source, a non-Gaussian operation, called photon subtraction, is subsequently introduced. Numerical analysis shows that the performance of ACVQKD with an untrusted source can be improved by properly adopting the photon subtraction operation. Moreover, a special situation where the untrusted source is located in the middle of the atmospheric channel is also considered. Under direct reconciliation, we find that its performance can be significantly improved when the photon subtraction operation is manipulated by the sender.

TI Resource guide for teaching post-quantum cryptography
SO CRYPTOLOGIA
AB Public-key cryptography has become a popular way to motivate the teaching of concepts in elementary number theory, abstract algebra, and introduction to proof courses, as well as in cryptography courses. Unfortunately, many experts expect quantum computers to make common forms of public-key cryptography obsolete in the near future. Fortunately, there are several systems being evaluated to replace RSA and the other systems we currently use. While some of the systems are too complicated to be good examples in introductory courses, others are either quite manageable or have simplified versions that are manageable. This article gives a tour of the main types of systems under consideration and the teaching resources available for instructors who want to teach them.

TI Classical simulation of Gaussian quantum circuits with non-Gaussian
   input states
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB We consider Gaussian quantum circuits supplemented with non-Gaussian input states and derive sufficient conditions for efficient classical strong simulation of these circuits. In particular, we generalise the stellar representation of continuous-variable quantum states to the multimode setting and relate the stellar rank of the input non-Gaussian states, a recently introduced measure of non-Gaussianity, to the cost of evaluating classically the output probability densities of these circuits. Our results have consequences for the strong simulability of a large class of near-term continuous-variable quantum circuits.

TI Research Progress in Metasurfaces for Integrated Quantum Sensing
   (Invited)
SO ACTA OPTICA SINICA
AB Significance Quantum sensing technology is one of the three core quantum technologies. By taking advantage of quantum effects, quantum sensing technology can achieve ultrahigh-precision measurements. However, as the requirements for sensing accuracy and portability in emerging application scenarios continue to grow, integration has become an important core direction for the development of quantum sensing technology. As an important component of the quantum sensing system, the miniaturization and integration of the optical system are important steps in the integration of the quantum sensing system. However, traditional components for light field manipulations are often bulky and heavy, which restricts their utilization in miniaturized optical devices and compact detection systems. Unlike traditional optical devices, metasurfaces offer a new way to manipulate the light field in the subwavelength range through the interaction between light and meta-atoms. Based on the arrangement of two-dimensional planar subwavelength structures, metasurfaces can achieve three-dimensional spatial control of light field intensity, polarization, and phase. Moreover, their semiconductor process compatibility and multi-parameter free control capabilities are highly consistent with the requirements of integrated quantum sensing for precise on-chip quantum state control and measurement, which can provide key technical support for the construction of on-chip integrated quantum sensing systems. In recent years, metasurface technology has made innovative application attempts in the construction of magneto-optical traps, the confinement of neutral atoms, and the quantum measurement of thermal atom ensembles, which is expected to promote the rapid development of integrated quantum sensing technology. Progress Focusing on light field's spatial dimension transformation, we categorize metasurfaces into free-space and guided wave-driven metasurfaces, as shown in Fig. 1. These two types of metasurfaces will help realize the replacement of traditional optical devices and the on-chip integration of optical systems, enabling functions such as focusing, wavefront control, polarized light generation, and vortex light generation. Based on the resonant modes of meta-atoms participating in the optical response, we classify metasurfaces into local and nonlocal metasurfaces. We discuss three local phase modulation mechanisms for metasurfaces: resonant phase, propagation phase, and geometric phase, as shown in Fig. 2. All of these can be uniformly described using the Jones matrix. These enable the manipulation of the phase, polarization, and spectral resonant characteristics of free-space light fields. Combining multiple phase modulation mechanisms in design allows for multifunctional integrated metasurfaces. By leveraging the principle of nonlocal bound states in the continuum (BICs) in nonlocal metasurfaces, narrowband spectral manipulation and vortex beam generation can be achieved. Meanwhile, we discuss the local and nonlocal phase modulation mechanisms in the guided wave-driven metasurfaces, realizing controllable on-chip light emission and multi-parameter light field control. We also summarize some emerging research based on the waveguide and metasurface composite structure and compare the forward design and inverse design methods in metasurface design. As an emerging optical technology, metasurfaces demonstrate significant potential in the field of integrated quantum sensing due to their precise light field manipulation capabilities.
   They enable optical effects unattainable with conventional technologies and significantly enhance sensing precision and integration density. We summarize emerging applications of metasurfaces in quantum sensing, including photonic integrated 3D magneto-optical traps (MOTs), on-chip atom-trapping optical tweezer arrays, and multi-parameter control optical elements. We also elaborate on the rationale and current development status of each research area, analyzing their advantages and limitations. We summarize the miniaturization process of 3D magneto-optical traps. At the current stage, magneto-optical traps, whose optical components are composed of metasurfaces and photonic integrated circuits, represent the frontier of development and are expected to be integrated with other on-chip optical devices, as shown in Fig. 4. Metasurfaces have also been applied in the trapping of nanoparticles and neutral atoms, enabling significant improvements in device geometric dimensions and trapping capabilities, as shown in Fig. 5. Metasurface, as a multi-parameter control optical elements, can significantly reduce the volume of optical systems, optimize key performance parameters, and even achieve new functions. Moreover, they possess the capability of synergistic regulation of multiple parameters related to light fields, such as polarization, amplitude, and wavefront, as shown in Fig. 6. By applying an external electric field or optical field, the state of metasurfaces can be dynamically regulated directly, enabling function switching, reconstruction, and programming of devices, thus significantly enhancing their adaptability. Finally, we provid an outlook on the challenges and future development directions of metasurfaces in the field of integrated quantum sensing. Conclusions and Prospects In summary, we emphasize that metasurfaces hold tremendous application potential in the field of integrated quantum sensing. They can significantly reduce the footprint of quantum sensing systems and strongly promote their integration. Significant progress has been achieved in areas such as wavefront shaping, polarization conversion, vortex beam generation, and holographic imaging. Moreover, further research is needed to address the challenges of large-scale manufacturing and integration of metasurfaces. We envision that metasurfaces, serving as core light-field manipulation components, will bring new breakthroughs and advancements to integrated quantum sensing technology.

TI Experimental observation of Earth's rotation with quantum entanglement
SO SCIENCE ADVANCES
AB Precision interferometry with quantum states has emerged as an essential tool for experimentally answering fundamental questions in physics. Optical quantum interferometers are of particular interest because of mature methods for generating and manipulating quantum states of light. Their increased sensitivity promises to enable tests of quantum phenomena, such as entanglement, in regimes where tiny gravitational effects come into play. However, this requires long and decoherence-free processing of quantum entanglement, which, for large interferometric areas, remains unexplored territory. Here, we present a table-top experiment using maximally path-entangled quantum states of light in a large-scale interferometer sensitive enough to measure the rotation rate of Earth. The achieved sensitivity of 5 mu rad s(-1) constitutes the highest rotation resolution ever reached with optical quantum interferometers. Further improvements to our methodology will enable measurements of general-relativistic effects on entangled photons, allowing the exploration of the interplay between quantum mechanics and general relativity, along with tests for fundamental physics.

TI Mapping state transition susceptibility in quantum annealing
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Quantum annealing is a novel type of analog computation that aims to use quantum-mechanical fluctuations to search for optimal solutions for Ising problems. Quantum annealing in the transverse field Ising model, implemented on D-Wave devices, works by applying a time-dependent transverse field, which puts all qubits into a uniform state of superposition, and then applying a Hamiltonian over time, which describes a user-programed Ising problem. We present a method that utilizes two control features of D-Wave quantum annealers, namely reverse annealing and an h-gain schedule, to quantify the susceptibility, or the distance, between two classical states of an Ising problem. The starting state is encoded using reverse annealing, and the second state is encoded on the linear terms of a problem Hamiltonian. An h-gain schedule is specified, which incrementally increases the strength of the linear terms, thus allowing a quantification of the h-gain strength required to transition the anneal into a specific state at the final measurement. Because of the nature of quantum annealing, the state tends towards global minima, and therefore we restrict the second classical state to a minimum solution of the given Ising problem. This susceptibility mapping, when enumerated across all initial states, shows in detail the behavior of the quantum annealer during reverse annealing. The procedure is experimentally demonstrated on three small test Ising models which were embedded in parallel on the D-Wave Advantage_system4.1. Analysis of the state transition mapping shows detailed characteristics of the reverse annealing process, including intermediate state transition paths, which are visually represented as state transition networks.

TI Perfect discrimination of quantum measurements using entangled systems
SO NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB Distinguishing physical processes is one of the fundamental problems in quantum physics. Although distinguishability of quantum preparations and quantum channels have been studied considerably, distinguishability of quantum measurements remains largely unexplored. We investigate the problem of single-shot discrimination of quantum measurements using two strategies, one based on single quantum systems and the other one based on entangled quantum systems. First, we formally define both scenarios. We then construct sets of measurements (including non-projective) in arbitrary finite dimensions that are perfectly distinguishable within the second scenario using quantum entanglement, while not in the one based on single quantum systems. Furthermore, we show that any advantage in measurement discrimination tasks over single systems is a demonstration of Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen 'quantum steering'. Alongside, we prove that all pure two-qubit entangled states provide an advantage in a measurement discrimination task over one-qubit systems.

TI Catalysis always degrades external quantum correlations
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Catalysts used in quantum resource theories need not be in isolation and, therefore, are possibly correlated with external systems, which the agent does not have access to. Do such correlations help or hinder catalysis, and does the classicality or quantumness of such correlations matter? To answer this question, we first focus on the existence of a noninvasively measurable observable that yields the same outcomes for repeated measurements since this signifies macrorealism, a key property distinguishing classical systems from quantum systems. We show that a system quantumly correlated with an external system so that the joint state is necessarily perturbed by any repeatable quantum measurement also has the same property against general quantum channels. Our full characterization of such systems called totally quantum systems, solves the open problem of characterizing tomographically sensitive systems raised in [Phys. Rev. Lett. 130, 020802 (2023)]. An immediate consequence is that a totally quantum system cannot catalyze any quantum process, even when a measure of correlation with its environment is arbitrarily low. It generalizes to a stronger result, that the mutual information of totally quantum systems cannot be used as a catalyst either. These results culminate in the conclusion that, out of the correlations, that a generic quantum catalyst has with its environment, only classical correlations allow for catalysis, and, therefore, using a correlated catalyst is equivalent to using an ensemble of uncorrelated catalysts.

TI Imaging the interface of a qubit and its quantum-many-body environment
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Decoherence affects all quantum systems, natural or artificial, and is the primary obstacle impeding quantum technologies. We show theoretically that for a Rydberg qubit in a Bose condensed environment, experiments can image the system-environment interface that is central for decoherence. High-precision absorption images of the condensed environment will be able to capture transient signals that show the real-time buildup of a mesoscopic entangled state in the environment. This is possible before decoherence sources other than the condensate itself can kick in, since qubit decoherence timescales can be tuned from the order of nanoseconds to microseconds by a choice of the excited Rydberg principal quantum number nu. Imaging the interface will allow detailed explorations of open quantum system concepts and may offer guidance for coherence protection in challenging scenarios with non-Markovian environments.

TI Benchmarking and Fidelity Response Theory of High-Fidelity Rydberg
   Entangling Gates
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB The fidelity of entangling operations is a key figure of merit in quantum information processing, especially in the context of quantum error correction. High-fidelity entangling gates in neutral atoms have seen remarkable advancement recently. A full understanding of error sources and their respective contributions to gate infidelity will enable the prediction of fundamental limits on quantum gates in neutral atom platforms with realistic experimental constraints. In this work, we implement the time-optimal Rydberg controlled-Z(CZ) gate, design a circuit to benchmark its fidelity, and achieve a fidelity, averaged over symmetric input states, of 0.9971(5), downward corrected for leakage error, which together with our recent work [Nature 634, 321-327 (2024)] forms a new state of the art for neutral atoms. The remaining infidelity is explained by an ab initio error model, consistent with our experimental results over a range of gate speeds, with varying contributions from different error sources. Further, we develop a fidelity response theory to efficiently predict infidelity from laser noise with nontrivial power spectral densities and derive scaling laws of infidelity with gate speed. Besides its capability of predicting gate fidelity, we also utilize the fidelity response theory to compare and optimize gate protocols, to learn laser frequency noise, and to study the noise response for quantum simulation tasks. Finally, we predict that a CZ gate fidelity of greater than or similar to 0.999 is feasible with realistic

TI Long-lived qubit entanglement by surface plasmon polaritons in a Weyl
   semimetal
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
AB We investigate spontaneous entanglement of two qubits mediated by nonreciprocal surface plasmon polaritons (SPPs) in a Weyl semimetal. In the absence of external magnetic fields, the topology of the Weyl semimetal even gives rise to nonreciprocal SPPs that are topologically protected and reside inside the photonic gap. We utilize this nonreciprocal SPP as a mediator of entanglement of two spatially separated qubits. Our two main findings are (1) the nonreciprocal SPP gives better quantum entanglement than the reciprocal one, and (2) the entanglement achieved in the Weyl semimetal is sufficiently long lived compared to the entanglement using SPPs in conventional metals.

AB We present a novel methodology for automated feature subset selection from a pool of physiological signals using Quantum Annealing (QA). As a case study, we will investigate the effectiveness of QA-based feature selection techniques in selecting the optimal feature subset for stress detection. Features are extracted from four signal sources: foot EDA, hand EDA, ECG, and respiration. The proposed method embeds the feature variables extracted from the physiological signals in a binary quadratic model. The bias of the feature variable is calculated using the Pearson correlation coefficient between the feature variable and the target variable. The weight of the edge connecting the two feature variables is calculated using the Pearson correlation coefficient between two feature variables in the binary quadratic model. Subsequently, D-Wave's clique sampler is used to sample cliques from the binary quadratic model. The underlying solution is then re-sampled to obtain multiple good solutions and the clique with the lowest energy is returned as the optimal solution. The proposed method is compared with commonly used feature selection techniques for stress detection. Results indicate that QA-based feature subset selection performed equally as that of classical techniques. However, under data uncertainty conditions such as limited training data, the performance of quantum annealing for selecting optimum features remained unaffected, whereas a significant decrease in performance is observed with classical feature selection techniques. Preliminary results show the promise of quantum annealing in optimizing the training phase of a machine learning classifier. especially under data uncertainty conditions.

TI Four-qubit CHSH game
SO QUANTUM INFORMATION PROCESSING
AB In this paper, the CHSH quantum game is extended to four players. This is achieved by exploring all possible 4-variable Boolean functions to identify those that yield a game scenario with a quantum advantage using a specific entangled state. Notably, two new four-player quantum games are presented. In one game, the optimal quantum strategy is achieved when players share a |GHZ4 >=12(|0000 >+|1111 >)\documentclass[12pt]{minimal} \usepackage{amsmath} \usepackage{wasysym} \usepackage{amsfonts} \usepackage{amssymb} \usepackage{amsbsy} \usepackage{mathrsfs} \usepackage{upgreek} \setlength{\oddsidemargin}{-69pt} \begin{document}$$\vert {GHZ_4} \rangle =\dfrac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(\vert {0000} \rangle +\vert {1111} \rangle )$$\end{document} state, breaking the traditional 10% gain observed in 2- and 3-qubit CHSH games and achieving a 22.5% gap. In the other game, players gain a greater advantage using a |W4 >=12(|0001 >+|0010 >+|0100 >+|1000 >)\documentclass[12pt]{minimal} \usepackage{amsmath} \usepackage{wasysym} \usepackage{amsfonts} \usepackage{amssymb} \usepackage{amsbsy} \usepackage{mathrsfs} \usepackage{upgreek} \setlength{\oddsidemargin}{-69pt} \begin{document}$$\vert {W_4} \rangle =\dfrac{1}{2}(\vert {0001} \rangle +\vert {0010} \rangle +\vert {0100} \rangle +\vert {1000} \rangle )$$\end{document} state as their quantum resource. Quantum games with other four-qubit entangled states are also explored. To demonstrate the results, these game scenarios are implemented on an online quantum computer, and the advantage of the respective quantum resource for each game is experimentally verified.

TI Investigation of Floquet engineered non-Abelian geometric phase for
   holonomic quantum computing
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Holonomic quantum computing functions by transporting an adiabatically degenerate manifold of computational states around a closed loop in a control-parameter space; this cyclic evolution results in a non-Abelian geometric phase which may couple states within the manifold. Realizing the required degeneracy is challenging and typically requires auxiliary levels or intermediate-level couplings. One potential way to circumvent this is through Floquet engineering, where the periodic driving of a nondegenerate Hamiltonian leads to degenerate Floquet bands, and subsequently non-Abelian gauge structures may emerge. Here we present an experiment in ultracold 87Rb atoms where atomic spin states are dressed by modulated RF fields to induce periodic driving of a family of Hamiltonians linked through a fully tuneable parameter space. The adiabatic motion through this parameter space leads to the holonomic evolution of the degenerate spin states in SU (2), characterized by a non-Abelian connection. We study the holonomic transformations of spin eigenstates in the presence of a background magnetic field, characterizing the fidelity of these single-qubit gate operations. Results indicate that while the Floquet engineering technique removes the need for explicit degeneracies, it inherits many of the same limitations present in degenerate systems.

TI Modular Component-Based ∼antum Circuit Synthesis
SO PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACM ON PROGRAMMING LANGUAGES-PACMPL
AB article, we present a novel method for synthesizing quantum circuits from user-supplied components. Given input-output state vectors and component quantum gates, our synthesizer aims to construct a quantum circuit that implements the provided functionality in terms of the supplied component gates. To achieve this, we basically use an enumerative search with pruning. To accelerate the procedure, however, we perform the search and pruning at the module level; instead of simply enumerating candidate circuits by appending component gates in sequence, we stack modules, which are groups of gate operations. With this modular approach, we can effectively reduce the search space by directing the search in a way that bridges the gap between the current circuit and the input-output specification. Evaluation on 17 benchmark problems shows that our technique is highly effective at synthesizing quantum circuits. Our method successfully synthesized 16 out of 17 benchmark circuits in 96.6 seconds on average. On the other hand, the conventional, gate-level synthesis algorithm succeeded in 10 problems with an average time of 639.1 seconds. Our algorithm increased the speed of the baseline by 20.3x for the 10 problems commonly solved by both approaches.

TI Entangling two levitated charged nanospheres through Coulomb interaction
SO CHINESE PHYSICS B
AB Limited by the thermal environment, the entanglement of a massive object is extremely difficult to generate. Based on a coherent scattering mechanism, we propose a scheme to generate the entanglement of two optically levitated nanospheres through the Coulomb interaction. Two nanospheres are charged and coupled to each other through the Coulomb interaction. In this manner, the entanglement of two nanospheres is induced either under a weak/strong optomechanical coupling regime or under an ultra-strong optomechanical coupling regime. The charges, radius and distance of the two nanospheres are taken into consideration to enhance the Coulomb interaction, thereby achieving a higher degree of entanglement in the absence of ground-state cooling. The corresponding maximum entanglement can be attained as the dynamics of the system approaches the boundary between the steady and the unsteady regimes. This provides a useful resource for both quantum-enhanced sensing and quantum information processing, as well as a new platform for studying many-body physics.

TI A quantum algorithm for track reconstruction in the LHCb vertex detector
SO JOURNAL OF INSTRUMENTATION
AB High-energy physics is facing increasingly demanding computational challenges in real-time event reconstruction for the near-future high-luminosity era. Using the LHCb vertex detector as a use case, we explore a new algorithm for particle track reconstruction based on the minimisation of an Ising-like Hamiltonian with a linear algebra approach. The use of a classical matrix inversion technique results in tracking performance similar to the current state-of-the-art but with worse scaling complexity in time. To solve this problem, we also present an implementation as a quantum algorithm, using the Harrow-Hassadim-Lloyd (HHL) algorithm: this approach can potentially provide an exponential speedup as a function of the number of input hits over its classical counterpart, in spite of limitations due to the well-known HHL Hamiltonian simulation and readout problems. The findings presented in this paper shed light on the potential of leveraging quantum computing for real-time particle track reconstruction in high-energy physics.

TI Non-Gaussian operations in measurement-device-independent quantum key
   distribution
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Non-Gaussian operations in continuous variable (CV) quantum key distribution (QKD) have been limited to photon subtraction on squeezed vacuum states only. This is mainly due to the ease of calculating the covariance matrix representation of such states. In this paper we study the effects of general non-Gaussian operations corresponding to photon addition, catalysis, and subtraction on squeezed coherent states on CV measurement-device-independent (MDI) QKD. We find that non-Gaussianity coupled with coherence can yield significantly longer transmission distances than without. Particularly we observe that zero photon catalysis on the two-mode squeezed coherent state (TMSC) is an optimal choice for CV MDI QKD, while single photon subtraction is also a good candidate; both of them offer nearly 70 km of transmission distances. We also derive a single generalized covariance matrix for the aforementioned states which will be useful in several other aspects of CV quantum information processing.

TI Relativistic independence and multipartite quantum correlations
SO EUROPEAN PHYSICAL JOURNAL-SPECIAL TOPICS
AB Multipartite quantum correlations are complex and intricate, posing challenges for their detection and quantification. Nevertheless, they are central to both fundamental quantum science and its numerous applications. We discuss several approaches for analyzing quantum correlations, with an emphasis on the Relativistic Independence framework which allows one to detect and differentiate classes of multipartite entangled states, while also yielding refined quantum bounds on multipartite systems. This framework is shown to rely on a recently demonstrated tradeoff between local and nonlocal correlations, signifying the enabling power of quantum uncertainty. Furthermore, we examine these notions from the broader perspective of quantum reference frames (QRFs), attempting to see which of the above concepts are perspective-dependent and which are not. Large parts of the current discussion, as well as many of the quantitative results presented, specifically rely on the structure of the covariance matrix, whose determinant remains invariant under QRF changes, thereby signaling its fundamental significance.

Our experimentally feasible system explores tunable all-optical-switching, double-optomechanically induced transparency (OMIT) and optomechanically induced absorption (OMIA). The proposed system is also shown to generate anomalous dispersion. Our theoretical results show that the system can switch between OMIT and OMIA by manipulating the relevant system parameters. The normal-mode-splitting (NMS) effect induced by the interactions between the sub-systems is discussed in detail and the effects of varying the interactions on the NMS are analysed. These rich optical properties of the probe field may provide a promising platform for controllable all-optical-switch and various other quantum photonic devices.

TI Quantum Gate for a Kerr Nonlinear Parametric Oscillator Using Effective
   Excited States
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW APPLIED
AB A Kerr nonlinear parametric oscillator (KPO) can stabilize a quantum superposition of two coherent states with opposite phases, which can be used as a qubit. In a universal gate set for quantum computation with KPOs, an Rx gate, which interchanges the two coherent states, is relatively hard to perform owing to the stability of the two states. We propose a method for a high-fidelity Rx gate by exciting the KPO outside the qubit space with parity-selective transitions, which can be implemented by only adding a driving field. In this method, the utilization of higher effective excited states leads to a faster Rx gate, rather than states near the qubit space. The proposed method can realize a continuous Rx gate and thus is expected to be useful for, e.g., recently proposed variational quantum algorithms.

TI Fast and Parallelizable Logical Computation with Homological Product
   Codes
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW X
AB Quantum error correction is necessary to perform large-scale quantum computation but requires extremely large overheads in both space and time. High-rate quantum low-density-parity-check (qLDPC) codes promise a route to reduce qubit numbers, but performing computation while maintaining low space cost has required serialization of operations and extra time costs. In this work, we design fast and parallelizable logical gates for qLDPC codes and demonstrate their utility for key algorithmic subroutines such as the quantum adder. Our gate gadgets utilize transversal logical CNOTs between a data qLDPC code and a suitably constructed ancilla code to perform parallel Pauli product measurements (PPMs) on the data logical qubits. For hypergraph product codes, we show that the ancilla can be constructed by simply modifying the base classical codes of the data code, achieving parallel PPMs on a subgrid of the logical qubits with a lower space-time cost than existing schemes for an important class of circuits. Generalizations to 3D and 4D homological product codes further feature fast PPMs in constant depth. While prior work on qLDPC codes has focused on individual logical gates, we initiate the study of fault-tolerant compilation with our expanded set of native qLDPC code operations, constructing algorithmic primitives for preparing k-qubit Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger states and distilling or teleporting k magic states with O(1) space overhead in O(1) and O( k log k) logical cycles, respectively. We further generalize this to key algorithmic subroutines, demonstrating the efficient implementation of quantum adders using parallel operations. Our constructions are naturally compatible with reconfigurable architectures such as neutral atom arrays, paving the way to large-scale quantum computation with low space and time overheads.

TI Multigroup cooperative evolutionary optimization algorithm combined with
   quantum entanglement for cross-field applications
SO ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE REVIEW
AB Swarm intelligence algorithms are a class of bionic probabilistic heuristic search methods that are inspired by the collective behaviors of biological agents. In this paper, a multigroup cooperative evolutionary optimization algorithm is proposed by referring to the interaction behaviors of species diversity and stability in the ecosystem. First, the group updating mechanism of the traditional seeking and tracking mode with a dynamic population update mechanism is adopted. The multi-population interactive update group and the quantum entanglement update group are introduced to guide the algorithm to gradually approach the global optimal solution. Second, the proposed bionic algorithm is extended for cross-field applications. The algorithm is applied to solve the function optimization problems, as well as problems in four distinct application fields, including robot routing optimization of grid maps, vehicle scheduling optimization of dairy enterprises, location optimization of logistics centers, and plasma trajectory planning optimization. The proposed multigroup cooperative evolutionary optimization algorithm achieves competitive results in these application fields, thus demonstrating its versatility and robustness.

TI Adaptive construction of shallower quantum circuits with quantum spin
   projection for fermionic systems
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Quantum computing is a promising approach to harnessing strong correlation in molecular systems; however, current devices only allow for hybrid quantum-classical algorithms with a shallow circuit depth, such as the variational quantum eigensolver (VQE). In this paper, we report the importance of the Hamiltonian symmetry in constructing VQE circuits adaptively (ADAPT-VQE). This treatment often violates symmetry, thereby deteriorating the convergence of fidelity to the exact solution and ultimately resulting in deeper circuits. We demonstrate that spin-symmetry projection can provide a simple yet effective solution to this problem, by keeping the quantum state in the correct symmetry space, to reduce the overall gate operations. To further investigate the role of spin-symmetry in computing molecular properties with ADAPT-VQE, we have derived the analytical derivative of symmetry-projected VQE energy. Our illustrative calculations reveal the significance of preserving symmetry in providing accurate dipole moments and geometries with variational approximations.

AB The holonomic approach to controlling (nitrogen-vacancy) NV-center qubits provides an elegant way of theoretically devising universal quantum gates that operate on qubits via calculable microwave pulses. There is, however, a lack of simulated results from the theory of holonomic control of quantum registers with more than two qubits describing the transition between the dark states. Considering this, we have been experimenting with the IBM Quantum Experience technology to determine the capabilities of simulating holonomic control of NV-centers for three qubits describing an eight-level system that produces a non-Abelian geometric phase. The tunability of the geometric phase via the detuning frequency is demonstrated through the high fidelity (similar to 85%) of three-qubit off-resonant holonomic gates over the on-resonant ones. The transition between the dark states shows the alignment of the gate's dark state with the qubit's initial state hence decoherence of the multi-qubit system is well-controlled through a pi/3 rotation.

TI Feasibility and parameter optimization of ground-to-satellite uplink
   continuous-variable quantum key distribution
SO NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB Driven by the necessitates of wide-area quantum secure communication networks, ground-to-satellite quantum key distribution (QKD) has been highlighted in the field of quantum information. Continuous variable QKD (CV-QKD) shows the advantages of a high secure key rate generation and compatibility in the fiber channel, but the communication range is limited by low attenuation tolerance. In this study, the feasibility of the uplink CV-QKD for Very Low Earth Orbit satellite is studied, and the influence of practical factors such as atmospheric turbulence and beam pointing errors under dynamic time-varying satellite orbital parameters is analyzed to model realistic transmission channels. A parameter optimization scheme for orbital parameters, spot size, receiving telescope aperture, and modulation variance has been proposed to enhance the performance of the actual uplink CV-QKD, providing a reference for parameter selection in CV-QKD experiments.

TI Classical model emerges in quantum entanglement: Quantum Monte Carlo
   study for an Ising-Heisenberg bilayer
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
AB By developing a cluster sampling of the stochastic series expansion quantum Monte Carlo method, we investigate a spin -21 model on a bilayer square lattice with intralayer ferromagnetic (FM) Ising coupling and interlayer antiferromagnetic Heisenberg interaction. The continuous quantum phase transition which occurs at gc = 3.045(2) between the FM Ising phase and the dimerized phase is studied via large-scale simulations. From analysis of the critical exponents we show that this phase transition belongs to the (2+1)-dimensional Ising universality class. In addition, the quantum entanglement is strong between the two layers, especially in the dimerized phase. The effective Hamiltonian of a single layer seems like a transverse-field Ising model. However, we found that the quantum entanglement Hamiltonian is a pure classical Ising model without any quantum fluctuations. Furthermore, we give a more general explanation about how a classical entanglement Hamiltonian emerges.

In this paper, we introduce a new quantum algorithm based on a movement strategy to find these separators in a quantum superposition with linear complexity. Our algorithm has been tested on small directed graphs using a real Quantum Computer made by IBM.

TI Ultra-broadband, ultra-narrowband, and ultra-passband composite
   polarization half-wave plates, ultra-broadband composite
   polarization-rotators, and quantum-classical analogy
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB Composite pulses, which produce ultra-broadband, ultra-narrowband and ultrapassband x-, y-rotations Rx(theta) = exp{-i theta sigma x/2}, Ry(theta) = exp{-i theta sigma y/2} by the rotational angle theta = pi on the Bloch-Poincar & eacute; sphere, are presented. In polarization optics, the first class plays a role in the design of achromatic polarization retarders, while the second class corresponds to chromatic polarization filters. The third class is an assortment of the above two classes. Besides, composite pulses, which produce ultra-broadband z-rotations Rz(zeta) = exp-i zeta sigma z/2 by the phasal angle zeta = pi on the same sphere, are presented. These phasal pulses coincide with achromatic polarization pi rotators. The evolution matrix and the Jones matrix have similar forms in quantum optics and polarization optics. In the context of quantum optics, quantum computing, and quantum information processing, following the quantum-classical analogy, we achieve ultra-robust, ultrasensitive, and ultrasquare quantum control of an X (NOT) gate, and ultra-robust control of a Z phase gate, with respect to pulse area error. Our proposed UBBN (BatN), UNBN (SnakeN), UPBN (OctopusN), and UBBPhN (BatPhN) sequences are novel due to the novel methods of derivation. They surpass and outperform the superior candidates of the similar subclass of altering variable rotations in literature - BB2, NB2, and PB2, in precision parameters such as broadness, narrowness, FWHM, or execution time. We suggest that, in general, the presented composite pulse sequences are interdisciplinary and can have other possible applications, such as nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and spectroscopy, quantum sensing, local addressing, optical switching, cold-atom interferometry, quantum communication, quantum cryptography, quantum image processing, and quantum steganography.

TI Scaling up and down of 3-D floating-point data in quantum computation
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB In the past few decades, quantum computation has become increasingly attractive due to its remarkable performance. Quantum image scaling is considered a common geometric transformation in quantum image processing, however, the quantum floating-point data version of which does not exist. Is there a corresponding scaling for 2-D and 3-D floating-point data? The answer is yes. In this paper, we present a quantum scaling up and down scheme for floating-point data by using trilinear interpolation method in 3-D space. This scheme offers better performance (in terms of the precision of floating-point numbers) for realizing the quantum floating-point algorithms than previously classical approaches. The Converter module we proposed can solve the conversion of fixed-point numbers to floating-point numbers of arbitrary size data with p + q qubits based on IEEE-754 format, instead of 32-bit single-precision, 64-bit double-precision and 128-bit extended-precision. Usually, we use nearest-neighbor interpolation and bilinear interpolation to achieve quantum image scaling algorithms, which are not applicable in high-dimensional space. This paper proposes trilinear interpolation of floating-point data in 3-D space to achieve quantum algorithms of scaling up and down for 3-D floating-point data. Finally, the quantum scaling circuits of 3-D floating-point data are designed.

TI Virtual Channel Purification
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB Quantum error mitigation is a key approach for extracting target state properties on state-of-the-art noisy machines and early fault-tolerant devices. Using the ideas from flag fault tolerance and virtual state purification, we develop the virtual-channel-purification (VCP) protocol, which consumes similar qubit and gate resources as virtual state purification but offers stronger error suppression with increased system size and more noisy operation copies. The application of VCP does not require specific knowledge about the target quantum state, the target problem and the gate noise model in the target circuit, and can still offer rigorous performance guarantees for practical noise regimes as long as the noise is incoherent. Further connections are made between VCP and quantum error correction to produce the virtual error-correction (VEC) protocol, one of the first protocols that combine quantum error correction (QEC) and quantum error mitigation beyond directly applying error-mitigation protocols on top of logical qubits. Assuming perfect syndrome extraction, VEC can virtually remove all correctable noise in the channel while paying only the same sampling cost as low-order purification. It can achieve QEC-level protection on an unencoded register when transmitting it through a noisy channel, removing the associated encoding qubit overhead. Another variant of VEC can mimic the error-suppression power of the surface code by inputting only a bit-flip and a phase-flip code. Our protocol can also be adapted to key tasks in quantum networks like channel capacity activation and entanglement distribution.

TI Quantum entanglement and one-way steering in a cavity magnomechanical
   system via a squeezed vacuum field
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB We propose a simple scheme to generate quantum entanglement and one-way steering between distinct mode pairs in a generic cavity magnomechanical system, which is composed of a microwave cavity and a yttrium iron garnet sphere supporting magnon and phonon modes. The microwave cavity is pumped by a weak squeezed vacuum field, which plays an important role for establishing quantum entanglement and steering. It is found that when the magnon mode is driven by the red-detuned laser, the maximum entanglement between cavity mode and phonon mode and the maximum phonon-to-photon one-way steering can be effectively generated via adjusting the ratio of two coupling rates. While under the much weaker magnomechanical coupling, the quantum entanglement and one-way steering between cavity mode and magnon mode can be achieved, where the steering direction is determined merely by the relative dissipation strength of the cavity to the magnon mode. More interestingly, we reveal that the robustness to the temperature for entanglement and steering between any mode pairs can be evidently enhanced by selecting the squeezing parameter appropriately.

This paper investigates the relationship between coherence length, decay width (\documentclass[12pt]{minimal} \usepackage{amsmath} \usepackage{wasysym} \usepackage{amsfonts} \usepackage{amssymb} \usepackage{amsbsy} \usepackage{mathrsfs} \usepackage{upgreek} \setlength{\oddsidemargin}{-69pt} \begin{document}$$\Gamma$$\end{document}), and atomic mass in radiative capture reactions using a machine learning model. Additionally, the quantum entanglement of the resulting states is quantified using the von Neumann entropy. The results demonstrate the inverse relationship between coherence length and decay width, highlighting the universal nature of this relationship across various reactions. The findings provide valuable insights into the behavior of particles in radiative capture reactions and have implications for both experimental and theoretical studies in nuclear and particle physics.

TI Encoding strongly-correlated many-boson wavefunctions on a photonic
   quantum computer: application to the attractive Bose-Hubbard model
SO QUANTUM
AB Variational quantum algorithms (VQA) are considered as some of the most promising methods to determine the properties of complex strongly correlated quantum many-body systems, especially from the perspective of devices available in the near term. In this context, the development of efficient quantum circuit ansatze to encode a many-body wavefunction is one of the keys for the success of a VQA. Great efforts have been invested to study the potential of current quantum devices to encode the eigenstates of fermionic systems, but little is known about the encoding of bosonic systems. In this work, we investigate the encoding of the ground state of the (simple but rich) attractive Bose-Hubbard model using a Continuous-Variable (CV) photonic-based quantum circuit. We introduce two different ansatz architectures and demonstrate that the proposed continuous variable quantum circuits can accurately encode (with a fidelity higher than 99%) the strongly correlated many-boson wavefunction with just a few layers, in all many-body regimes and for different number of bosons and initial states. Beyond the study of the suitability of the ansatz to approximate the ground states of many-boson systems, we also perform initial evaluations of the use of the ansatz in a variational quantum eigensolver algorithm to find it through energy minimization. To this end we also introduce a scheme to measure the Hamiltonian energy in an experimental system , and study the effect of sampling noise.

TI Symmetry-Induced Emergence of a Pseudo-Qutrit in the Dipolar Coupling of

SO ENTROPY
AB We investigate a system of two identical and distinguishable spins 1/2, with a direct magnetic dipole-dipole interaction, in an external magnetic field. Constraining the hyperfine tensor to exhibit axial symmetry generates the notable symmetry properties of the corresponding Hamiltonian model. In fact, we show that the reduction of the anisotropy induces the invari S-2 invariably assumes its highest eigenvalue of 2. By means of appropriate mapping, it is then possible to choose initial density matrices of the two-spin system that evolve in such a way as to exactly simulate the time evolution of a pseudo-qutrit, in the sense that the the actual two-spin system nests the subdynamics of a qutrit regardless of the strength of the magnetic field. The occurrence of this dynamic similitude is investigated using two types of representation for the initial density matrix of the two spins. We show that the qutrit state emerges when the initial polarizations and probability vectors of the two spins are equal to each other. Further restrictions on the components of the probability vectors are reported and discussed.

QA efficiently explores low-energy configurations and overcomes local minima, enabling the generation of proposal states with a high acceptance probability. We benchmark QAEMCMC for the Sherrington-Kirkpatrick model and demonstrate its superior performance over the classical MCMC method. Our results reveal larger spectral gaps, faster convergence of energy observables, and reduced total variation distance between the empirical and target distributions. QAEMCMC accelerates MCMC and provides an efficient method for complex systems, paving the way for scalable quantum-assisted sampling strategies.

TI An Overview of Quantum Circuit Design Focusing on Compression and
   Representation
SO ELECTRONICS
AB Quantum image computing has attracted attention due to its vast storage capacity and faster image data processing, leveraging unique properties such as parallelism, superposition, and entanglement, surpassing classical computers. Although classical computing power has grown substantially over the last decade, its rate of improvement has slowed, struggling to meet the demands of massive datasets. Several approaches have emerged for encoding and compressing classical images on quantum processors. However, a significant limitation is the complexity of preparing the quantum state, which translates pixel coordinates into corresponding quantum circuits. Current approaches for representing large-scale images require higher quantum resources, such as qubits and connection gates, presenting significant hurdles. This article aims to overview the pixel intensity and state preparation circuits requiring fewer quantum resources and explore effective compression techniques for medium and high-resolution images. It also conducts a comprehensive study of quantum image representation and compression techniques, categorizing methods by grayscale and color image types and evaluating their strengths and weaknesses. Moreover, the efficacy of each model's compression can guide future research toward efficient circuit designs for medium- to high-resolution images. Furthermore, it is a valuable reference for advancing quantum image processing research by providing a systematic framework for evaluating quantum image compression and representation algorithms.

TI Observation of multiple steady states with engineered dissipation
SO NPJ QUANTUM INFORMATION
AB Simulating the dynamics of open quantum systems is essential in achieving practical quantum computation and understanding novel nonequilibrium behaviors. However, quantum simulation of a many-body system coupled to an engineered reservoir has yet to be fully explored in present-day experiment platforms. In this work, we introduce engineered noise into a one-dimensional ten-qubit superconducting quantum processor to emulate a generic many-body open quantum system. Our approach originates from the stochastic unravellings of the master equation. By measuring the end-to-end correlation, we identify multiple steady states stemmed from a strong symmetry, which is established on the modified Hamiltonian via Floquet engineering. Furthermore, we investigate the structure of the steady-state manifold by preparing initial states as a superposition of states within different sectors on a five-qubit chain. Our work provides a manageable and hardware-efficient strategy for the open-system quantum simulation.

To formally capture this property, we introduce the study of 'orthogonality broadcasting.' When attempting to broadcast the orthogonality of two different qubit bases, we establish that the power of classical and quantum communication is equivalent. However, quantum communication is shown to be strictly more powerful for broadcasting orthogonality in higher dimensions. We then relate orthogonality broadcasting to quantum position verification and provide a new method for establishing error bounds in the no pre-shared entanglement model that can address protocols previous methods could not. Our key technical contribution is an uncertainty relation that uses the geometric relation of the states that undergo broadcasting rather than the non-commutative aspect of the final measurements.

TI Wave-particle duality ellipse and application in quantum imaging with
   undetected photons
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB We present a systematic framework to quantify the interplay between coherence and wave-particle duality in generic two-path interference systems. Our analysis reveals a closed-form duality ellipse (DE) equality, that rigorously unifies visibility (a traditional waveness measure) and predictability (a particleness measure) with degree of coherence, providing a complete mathematical embodiment of Bohr's complementarity principle. Extending this framework to quantum imaging with undetected photons (QIUP), where both path information and photon interference are inherently linked to spatial object reconstruction, we establish an imaging duality ellipse (IDE) that directly connects wave-particle duality to the object's transmittance profile. This relation enables object characterization through duality measurements alone and remains robust against experimental imperfections such as decoherence and misalignment. Our results advance the fundamental understanding of quantum duality while offering a practical toolkit for optimizing coherence-driven quantum technologies, from imaging to sensing.

TI Quantum κ-Entropy: A Quantum Computational Approach
SO ENTROPY
AB A novel approach to the quantum version of kappa-entropy that incorporates it into the conceptual, mathematical and operational framework of quantum computation is put forward. Various alternative expressions stemming from its definition emphasizing computational and algorithmic aspects are worked out: First, for the case of canonical Gibbs states, it is shown that kappa-entropy is cast in the form of an expectation value for an observable that is determined. Also, an operational method named "the two-temperatures protocol" is introduced that provides a way to obtain the kappa-entropy in terms of the partition functions of two auxiliary Gibbs states with temperatures kappa-shifted above, the hot-system, and kappa-shifted below, the cold-system, with respect to the original system temperature. That protocol provides physical procedures for evaluating entropy for any kappa. Second, two novel additional ways of expressing the kappa-entropy are further introduced. One determined by a non-negativity definite quantum channel, with Kraus-like operator sum representation and its extension to a unitary dilation via a qubit ancilla. Another given as a simulation of the kappa-entropy via the quantum circuit of a generalized version of the Hadamard test. Third, a simple inter-relation of the von Neumann entropy and the quantum kappa-entropy is worked out and a bound of their difference is evaluated and interpreted. Also the effect on the kappa-entropy of quantum noise, implemented as a random unitary quantum channel acting in the system's density matrix, is addressed and a bound on the entropy, depending on the spectral properties of the noisy channel and the system's density matrix, is evaluated. The results obtained amount to a quantum computational tool-box for the kappa-entropy that enhances its applicability in practical problems.

TI Enhanced continuous-variable quantum key distribution protocol via
   adaptive signal processing
SO COMMUNICATIONS PHYSICS
AB Quantum key distribution (QKD) provides secure communication using quantum mechanics, with continuous-variable QKD (CV-QKD) being an attractive solution due to its compatibility with existing telecommunication technology. Its main drawback is susceptibility to signal loss in fibres and free-space links, including satellites, which limits performance. Here we show a software-based protocol enhancing CV-QKD by applying adaptive filters at the transmitter and receiver, allowing the system to dynamically respond to changing channel conditions. Our security analysis avoids relying on Gaussian extremality, giving accurate bounds on an eavesdropper's information. The protocol can also extract keys in regions that would normally be considered insecure. We demonstrate a threefold increase in secret-key rates compared with the best existing CV-QKD protocol, and in satellite simulations, up to a 400-fold improvement. Because it requires no hardware modifications, our method can be readily integrated into existing systems, paving the way for more practical and robust quantum communication networks.

TI Unveiling the geometric meaning of quantum entanglement: Discrete and
   continuous variable systems
SO FRONTIERS OF PHYSICS
AB We show that the manifold of quantum states is endowed with a rich and nontrivial geometric structure. We derive the Fubini-Study metric of the projective Hilbert space of a multi-qubit quantum system, endowing it with a Riemannian metric structure, and investigate its deep link with the entanglement of the states of this space. As a measure, we adopt the entanglement distance E preliminary proposed in Phys. Rev. A 101, 042129 (2020). Our analysis shows that entanglement has a geometric interpretation: E( divide psi & rang;) is the minimum value of the sum of the squared distances between divide psi & rang; and its conjugate states, namely the states nu mu center dot sigma mu divide psi & rang;, where nu mu are unit vectors and mu runs on the number of parties. Within the proposed geometric approach, we derive a general method to determine when two states are not the same state up to the action of local unitary operators. Furthermore, we prove that the entanglement distance, along with its convex roof expansion to mixed states, fulfils the three conditions required for an entanglement measure, that is: i) E( divide psi & rang;) = 0 iff divide psi & rang; is fully separable; ii) E is invariant under local unitary transformations; iii) E does not increase under local operation and classical communications. Two different proofs are provided for this latter property. We also show that in the case of two qubits pure states, the entanglement distance for a state divide psi & rang; coincides with two times the square of the concurrence of this state. We propose a generalization of the entanglement distance to continuous variable systems. Finally, we apply the proposed geometric approach to the study of the entanglement magnitude and the equivalence classes properties, of three families of states linked to the Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger states, the Briegel Raussendorf states and the W states. As an example of application for the case of a system with continuous variables, we have considered a system of two coupled Glauber coherent states.

TI Reducing Qubit Requirements while Maintaining Numerical Precision for
   the Variational Quantum Eigensolver: A Basis-Set-Free Approach
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY LETTERS
AB We present a basis-set-free approach to the variational quantum eigensolver using an adaptive representation of the spatial part of molecular wave functions. Our approach directly determines system-specific representations of qubit Hamiltonians while fully omitting globally defined basis sets. In this work, we use directly determined pair-natural orbitals on the level of second-order perturbation theory. This results in compact qubit Hamiltonians with high numerical accuracy. We demonstrate initial applications with compact Hamiltonians on up to 22 qubits where conventional representation would for the same systems require 40-100 or more qubits. We further demonstrate reductions in the quantum circuits through the structure of the pair-natural orbitals.

TI Single-Photon Detectors on Arbitrary Photonic Substrates
SO ACS PHOTONICS
AB Detecting nonclassical light is a central requirement for photonics-based quantum technologies. Unrivaled high efficiencies and low dark counts have positioned superconducting nanowire single-photon detectors (SNSPDs) as the leading detector technology for integrated photonic applications. However, a central challenge lies in their integration within photonic integrated circuits, regardless of material platform or surface topography. Here, we introduce a method based on transfer printing that overcomes these constraints and allows for the integration of SNSPDs onto arbitrary photonic substrates. With a kinetically controlled elastomer stamp, we transfer suspended SNSPDs onto commercially manufactured silicon and lithium niobate on insulator integrated photonic circuits. Focused ion beam metal deposition then wires the detectors to the circuits, thereby allowing us to monitor photon counts with >7% detection efficiencies. Our method eliminates detector integration bottlenecks and provides new venues for versatile, accessible, and scalable quantum information processors.

This algorithm aims to quantum simulate a subset of the nuclear inelastic scattering problems that are of physical interest in which the internal degrees of freedom of the reaction system are excited by time-dependent external interactions. We expect that our algorithm will enable an exponential speedup in simulating the dynamics of the subset of the inelastic scattering problems, which would also be advantageous for the applications to more complicated scattering problems. For a demonstration problem, we solve for the Coulomb excitation of the deuteron, where the quantum simulations are performed with IBM QISKIT.

TI Guided quantum compression for high dimensional data classification
SO MACHINE LEARNING-SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB Quantum machine learning provides a fundamentally different approach to analyzing data. However, many interesting datasets are too complex for currently available quantum computers. Present quantum machine learning applications usually diminish this complexity by reducing the dimensionality of the data, e.g. via auto-encoders, before passing it through the quantum models. Here, we design a classical-quantum paradigm that unifies the dimensionality reduction task with a quantum classification model into a single architecture: the guided quantum compression model. We exemplify how this architecture outperforms conventional quantum machine learning approaches on a challenging binary classification problem: identifying the Higgs boson in proton-proton collisions at the LHC. Furthermore, the guided quantum compression model shows better performance compared to the deep learning benchmark when using solely the kinematic variables in our dataset.

AB Quantum Low-Density Parity-Check (qLDPC) codes are a promising class of quantum error-correcting codes that exhibit constantrate encoding and high error thresholds, thereby facilitating scalable fault-tolerant quantum computation. However, real-time decoding of qLDPC codes remains a significant challenge due to the high connectivity of their check matrices, which typically requires solving large-scale linear systems with sparse structures. In particular, off-the-shelf qLDPC decoders are often subject to a tradeoff between accuracy and latency, thus yielding no accurate and real-time decoding. This paper presents Vegapunk, a software-hardware co-design framework that enables real-time qLDPC decoding with high accuracy. To improve decoding accuracy, we design an offline decoupling strategy leveraging Satisfiability Modulo Theories (SMT) optimizations to mitigate quantum degeneracy. To enable fast decoding, we introduce an online hierarchical decoding algorithm employing a greedy strategy. Furthermore, we show that our SMT-optimized strategy suffices to produce decoupled matrices with maximized sparsity, thus admitting a dedicated accelerator to fully exploit the sparsity and parallelism to achieve real-time qLDPC decoding. Experimental results demonstrate that Vegapunk enables real-time decoding ( < 1 mu s) for the Bivariate Bicycle (BB) code up to [[784,24,24]] while exhibiting logical error rates on par with the state-of-the-art decoder, i.e., BP+OSD.

TI Bell-state measurement exceeding 50% success probability with linear
   optics
SO SCIENCE ADVANCES
AB Bell-state projections serve as a fundamental basis for most quantum communication and computing protocols today. However, with current Bell-state measurement schemes based on linear optics, only two of four Bell states can be identified, which means that the maximum success probability of this vital step cannot exceed 50%. Here, we experimentally demonstrate a scheme that amends the original measurement with additional modes in the form of ancillary photons, which leads to a more complex measurement pattern, and ultimately a higher success probability of 62.5%. Experimentally, we achieve a success probability of (57.9 & PLUSMN; 1.4)%, a substantial improvement over the conventional scheme. With the possibility of extending the protocol to a larger number of ancillary photons, our work paves the way toward more efficient realizations of quantum technologies based on Bell-state measurements.

TI Impact of Parallel Gating on Gate Fidelities in Linear, Square, and Star
   Arrays of Noisy Flip-Flop Qubits
SO ADVANCED QUANTUM TECHNOLOGIES
AB Successfully implementing a quantum algorithm involves maintaining a low logical error rate by ensuring the validity of the quantum fault-tolerance theorem. The required number of physical qubits arranged in an array depends on the chosen Quantum Error Correction code and the achievable physical qubit error rate. As the qubit count in the array increases, parallel gating -simultaneously manipulating many qubits- becomes a crucial ingredient for successful computation. In this study, small arrays of a type of donor- and quantum dot-based qubits, known as flip-flop (FF) qubits, are investigated. Simulation results of gate fidelities in linear, square and star arrays of four FF qubits affected by realistic 1/f noise are presented to study the effect of parallel gating. The impact of two, three and four parallel one-qubit gates, as well as two parallel two-qubit gates, on fidelity is calculated by comparing different array geometries. The findings can contribute to the optimized manipulation of small FF qubit arrays and the design of larger ones.
   This study focuses on flip-flop qubits, utilizing antiparallel electron-nuclear spin states of a 31P$<^>{31}{\rm P}$ donor atom in a 28Si$<^>{28}{\rm Si}$ bulk and controlled by electric fields. They offer long-range inter-qubit interactions, relaxing constraints on inter-qubit distances. Simulation results of four noisy qubits arranged in linear, square, and star arrays are used to study the effects of parallel gating on gate fidelity and to compare fidelity across the different array types. image

TI Decoherence scaling transition in the dynamics of quantum information
   scrambling
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Reliable processing of quantum information for developing quantum technologies requires precise control of out-of-equilibrium many-body systems. This is a highly challenging task because the fragility of quantum states to external perturbations increases with the system size. Here, we report on a series of experimental quantum simulations that quantify the sensitivity of a controlled Hamiltonian evolution to perturbations that drive the system away from the targeted evolution. Based on out-of-time ordered correlations, we demonstrate that the decay rate of the process fidelity increases with the effective number K of correlated qubits as K alpha. As a function of the perturbation strength, we observe a decoherence scaling transition of the exponent alpha between two distinct dynamical regimes. In the limiting case below the critical perturbation strength, the exponent alpha drops sharply below 1, and there is no inherent limit to the number of qubits that can be controlled. This resilient quantum feature of the controlled dynamics of quantum information is promising for reliable control of large quantum systems.

TI Idler-free multi-channel discrimination via multipartite probe states
SO NPJ QUANTUM INFORMATION
AB The characterisation of Quantum Channel Discrimination (QCD) offers critical insight for future quantum technologies in quantum metrology, sensing and communications. The task of multi-channel discrimination creates a scenario in which the discrimination of multiple quantum channels can be equated to the idea of pattern recognition, highly relevant to the tasks of quantum reading, illumination and more. Although the optimal quantum strategy for many scenarios is an entangled idler-assisted protocol, the extension to a multi-hypothesis setting invites the exploration of discrimination strategies based on unassisted, multipartite probe states. In this work, we expand the space of possible quantum-enhanced protocols by formulating general classes of unassisted multi-channel discrimination protocols which are not assisted by idler modes. Developing a general framework for idler-free protocols, we perform an explicit investigation in the bosonic setting, studying prominent Gaussian channel discrimination problems for real-world applications. Our findings uncover the existence of strongly quantum advantageous, idler-free protocols for the discrimination of bosonic loss and environmental noise. This circumvents the necessity for idler assistance to achieve quantum advantage in some of the most relevant discrimination settings, significantly loosening practical requirements for prominent quantum-sensing applications.

AB Sixteen years ago, Scott Aaronson remarked (in the presence of Ray Laflamme) that quantum mechanics (QM) resembles an operating system on which the rest of Physics is running its application software (except for general relativity "which has not yet been successfully ported to this particular OS"). Prior to that, it took the insight of an educator and eminent computer scientist (Umesh Vazirani) to realize that a complete and consistent introduction to QM can be given via the language of qubits and quantum gates. Closer to the present, it took the profound intuition of another polymath (Terry Rudolph) to realize that the linear algebra normally at the foundation of such an approach can be replaced with a simple rewriting system accessible to middle school students. Rewriting systems are at the foundation of Computer Science, they are, in fact, the very fabric of it (e.g., Turing machines and lambda calculus), so these are very fortunate developments. Furthermore, a linear algebra prerequisite is now shared firmly in the CS undergraduate curriculum with Machine Learning, a topic that has known a very deep and sudden revival. Quantum Information Science and Technology (QIST) is inherently interdisciplinary and spans physics, computer science, mathematics, engineering, chemistry and materials science. We present three curricular plans for incorporating QIST topics (via Quantum Computing) into the CS undergraduate curriculum. Such plans have been constructed with a preliminary consultation with QED-C members (industry, academia, national labs, and government agencies) asking for comments, suggestions and general input on these three curricular plans.

TI Quantum error correction with Goppa codes from maximal curves: Design,
   simulation, and performance
SO DISCRETE MATHEMATICS ALGORITHMS AND APPLICATIONS
AB This paper characterizes Goppa codes of certain maximal curves over finite fields defined by equations of the form yn = xm + x. We investigate algebraic geometric and quantum stabilizer codes associated with these maximal curves and propose modifications to improve their parameters. The theoretical analysis is complemented by extensive simulation results, which validate the performance of these codes under various error rates. We provide concrete examples of the constructed codes, comparing them with known results to highlight their strengths and trade-offs. The simulation data, presented through detailed graphs and tables, offers insights into the practical behavior of these codes in noisy environments. Our findings demonstrate that while the constructed codes may not always achieve optimal minimum distances, they offer systematic construction methods and interesting parameter trade-offs that could be valuable in specific applications or for further theoretical study.

TI Quantum Fourier networks for solving parametric PDEs
SO QUANTUM SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB Many real-world problems, like modelling environment dynamics, physical processes, time series etc involve solving partial differential equations (PDEs) parameterised by problem-specific conditions. Recently, a deep learning architecture called Fourier neural operator (FNO) proved to be capable of learning solutions of given PDE families for any initial conditions as input. However, it results in a time complexity linear in the number of evaluations of the PDEs while testing. Given the advancements in quantum hardware and the recent results in quantum machine learning methods, we exploit the running efficiency offered by these and propose quantum algorithms inspired by the classical FNO, which result in time complexity logarithmic in the number of evaluations and are expected to be substantially faster than their classical counterpart. At their core, we use the unary encoding paradigm and orthogonal quantum layers and introduce a new quantum Fourier transform in the unary basis. We propose three different quantum circuits to perform a quantum FNO. The proposals differ in their depth and their similarity to the classical FNO. We also benchmark our proposed algorithms on three PDE families, namely Burgers' equation, Darcy's flow equation and the Navier-Stokes equation. The results show that our quantum methods are comparable in performance to the classical FNO. We also perform an analysis on small-scale image classification tasks where our proposed algorithms are at par with the performance of classical convolutional neural networks, proving their applicability to other domains as well.

TI Fast and reliable atom transport by optical tweezers
SO OPTICA QUANTUM
AB Movable single atoms have drawn significant attention for their potential as flying quantum memory in non-local, dynamic quantum computing architectures. However, when dynamic optical tweezers are employed to control atoms opto-mechanically, conventional methods such as adiabatic controls and constant jerk controls are either inherently slow or induce mechanical heating, leading to atom loss over long distances or at high speeds. To address these challenges, we explore the method known as shortcuts to adiabaticity (STA) as an efficient alternative for fast and reliable atom transport. We present a series of proof-of-concept experiments demonstrating that STA-based optical tweezer trajectories can achieve both rapid and reliable single-atom transport. These experiments include moving atoms between two locations, adjusting speeds en route, and navigating curved trajectories. Our results indicate that atoms can be transported with a constant acceleration on average over distances that is only limited by trap lifetime, while effectively suppressing vibrational heating. This makes STA methods particularly well-suited for long-distance atom transport, potentially spanning distances over centimeter scales, such as between quantum information devices.

TI Secure edge-based IoMT framework for ICU monitoring with TinyML and
   post-quantum cryptography
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB This article proposes a secure, real-time, intelligent, edge-based Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) monitoring framework for intensive care unit (ICU) environments. The system integrates TinyML-powered decision trees with lattice-based post-quantum cryptography (PQC), specifically Kyber 512, to enable low-latency anomaly detection and quantum-resistant data transmission. Although designed for deployment on resource-constrained ESP32 microcontrollers, the entire pipeline is implemented and evaluated within an OMNeT++ simulation environment, including on-device inference and PQC encryption. A synthetically generated ICU dataset, validated by three hospitals, ensures clinical relevance and robustness in diverse patient scenarios. Data fusion techniques improve feature reliability, while Kyber 512 provides lightweight, quantum-safe encryption. OMNeT++ simulations demonstrate end-to-end communication with zero observed packet loss and very low end-to-end latency, under realistic ICU network conditions. The framework addresses key challenges in computational efficiency, data confidentiality, and scalability, offering a future-ready solution for intelligent healthcare systems. The results show 99.4% accuracy in anomaly detection, with strong generalization validated on external datasets (PhysioNet: 98.5%, Kaggle: 99.0%). This work represents one of the first integrations of TinyML and PQC in a simulated IoMT setting, paving the way for secure, scalable, and intelligent ICU monitoring.

TI Gigahertz measurement-device-independent quantum key distribution using
   directly modulated lasers
SO NPJ QUANTUM INFORMATION
AB Measurement-device-independent quantum key distribution (MDI-QKD) is a technique for quantum-secured communication that eliminates all detector side-channels, although is currently limited by implementation complexity and low secure key rates. Here, we introduce a simple and compact MDI-QKD system design at gigahertz clock rates with enhanced resilience to laser fluctuations-thus enabling free-running semiconductor laser sources to be employed without spectral or phase feedback. This is achieved using direct laser modulation, carefully exploiting gain-switching and injection-locking laser dynamics to encode phase-modulated time-bin bits. Our design enables secure key rates that improve upon the state of the art by an order of magnitude, up to 8bps at 54dB channel loss and 2kbps in the finite-size regime for 30dB channel loss. This greatly simplified MDI-QKD system design and proof-of-principle demonstration shows that MDI-QKD is a practical, high-performance solution for future quantum communication networks.

TI A quantum coherent spin in hexagonal boron nitride at ambient conditions
SO NATURE MATERIALS
AB Solid-state spin-photon interfaces that combine single-photon generation and long-lived spin coherence with scalable device integration-ideally under ambient conditions-hold great promise for the implementation of quantum networks and sensors. Despite rapid progress reported across several candidate systems, those possessing quantum coherent single spins at room temperature remain extremely rare. Here we report quantum coherent control under ambient conditions of a single-photon-emitting defect spin in a layered van der Waals material, namely, hexagonal boron nitride. We identify that the carbon-related defect has a spin-triplet electronic ground-state manifold. We demonstrate that the spin coherence is predominantly governed by coupling to only a few proximal nuclei and is prolonged by decoupling protocols. Our results serve to introduce a new platform to realize a room-temperature spin qubit coupled to a multiqubit quantum register or quantum sensor with nanoscale sample proximity.

TI Genuine four-partite Bell nonlocality in the curved spacetime
SO EUROPEAN PHYSICAL JOURNAL C
AB The quantum Bell nonlocality plays a crucial role in quantum information processing. In this paper, we first obtain the quantitative analytical expression of the genuine four-partite Bell nonlocality of any 4-qubit quantum state. Then, we investigate and derive the genuine four-partite nonlocalities in the background of the Schwarzschild black hole and the Schwarzschild-de Sitter spacetime. In the Schwarzschild black hole, it is shown that the Hawking effect destroys the accessible genuine four-partite nonlocality whif the Hawking effect of the Schwarzschild-de Sitter spacetime on the genuine four-partite nonlocality of massless Dirac fields.

TI Template-Assisted Self-Assembly of Fluorescent Nanodiamonds for Scalable
   Quantum Technologies
SO ACS NANO
AB Milled nanodiamonds containing nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers are nanoscale quantum sensors that form colloidal dispersions. However, variations in their size, shape, and surface chemistry limit the ability to position individual nanodiamonds and statistically study properties that affect their optical and quantum characteristics. Here, we present a scalable strategy to form ordered arrays of nanodiamonds using capillary-driven, template-assisted self-assembly. We demonstrate the precise spatial arrangement of isolated nanodiamonds with diameters below 50 nm across millimeter-scale areas. Measurements of over 200 assembled nanodiamonds yield a statistical understanding of their structural, optical, and quantum properties. The NV centers' spin and charge properties are uncorrelated with nanodiamond size but rather are consistent with heterogeneity in their nanoscale environment.

TI On the query complexity of unitary channel certification
SO NPJ QUANTUM INFORMATION
AB Certifying the correct functioning of a unitary channel is a critical step toward reliable quantum information processing. In this work, we investigate the query complexity of the unitary channel certification task: testing whether a given d-dimensional unitary channel is identical to or epsilon-far in diamond distance from a target unitary operation. We show that incoherent algorithms-those without quantum memory-require Omega(d/epsilon 2) queries, matching the known upper bound. In addition, for general quantum algorithms, we prove a lower bound of Omega(d/epsilon)\documentclass[12pt]{minimal} \usepackage{amsmath} \usepackage{wasysym} \usepackage{amsfonts} \usepackage{amssymb} \usepackage{amsbsy} \usepackage{mathrsfs} \usepackage{upgreek} \setlength{\oddsidemargin}{-69pt} \begin{document}$$\Omega (\sqrt{d}/\varepsilon )$$\end{document} and present a matching quantum algorithm based on quantum singular value transformation, establishing a tight query complexity of Theta(d/epsilon)\documentclass[12pt]{minimal} \usepackage{amsmath} \usepackage{wasysym} \usepackage{amsfonts} \usepackage{amssymb} \usepackage{amsbsy} \usepackage{mathrsfs} \usepackage{upgreek} \setlength{\oddsidemargin}{-69pt} \begin{document}$$\Theta (\sqrt{d}/\varepsilon )$$\end{document}. On the other hand, notably, we prove that for almost all unitary channels drawn from a natural average-case ensemble, certification can be accomplished with only O(1/epsilon 2)\documentclass[12pt]{minimal} \usepackage{amsmath} \usepackage{wasysym} \usepackage{amsfonts} \usepackage{amssymb} \usepackage{amsbsy} \usepackage{mathrsfs} \usepackage{upgreek} \setlength{\oddsidemargin}{-69pt} \begin{document}$${\mathcal{O}}(1/{\varepsilon }<^>{2})$$\end{document} queries. This demonstrates an exponential query complexity gap between worst- and average-case scenarios in certification, implying that certification is significantly easier for most unitary channels encountered in practice. Together, our results offer both theoretical insights and practical tools for verifying quantum processes.

Employing the toolbox of cavity quantum electrodynamics, we here concatenate two identical nondestructive photon detectors to repeatedly detect and track a single photon propagating through a 60 m long optical fiber. By demonstrating that the combined signal-to-noise ratio of the two detectors surpasses each single one by about 2 orders of magnitude, we experimentally verify a key practical benefit of cascaded nondemolition detectors compared to conventional absorbing devices.

TI An Oracle-Based Framework for Implementing a Quantum Parallel
   Decoder/Multiplexer
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB Quantum computers excel at solving complex computational problems more efficiently than conventional supercomputers. However, a significant challenge in quantum computing is implementing key operations of conventional computers, such as arithmetic operations and decoding, using quantum hardware (quantum gates). The absence of quantum gates directly implementing fundamental Boolean operations poses a hurdle. This paper introduces an oracle-based approach for implementing quantum decoding and multiplexing in a joint circuit, where oracles function as pre-programmed black boxes determining data flow. The parallel operation of oracles distinguishes this approach from sequential circuits, improving overall performance. The study validates the design using the Qiskit open-source software development kit through extensive simulations.

TI Compact fermion to qubit mappings
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
AB Mappings between fermions and qubits are valuable constructions in physics. To date only a handful exist. In addition to revealing dualities between fermionic and spin systems, such mappings are indispensable in any quantum simulation of fermionic physics on quantum computers. The number of qubits required per fermionic mode, and the locality of mapped fermionic operators strongly impact the cost of such simulations. We present a fermion to qubit mapping that outperforms all previous local mappings in both the qubit to mode ratio and the locality of mapped operators. In addition to these practically useful features, the mapping bears an elegant relationship to the toric code, which we discuss. Finally, we consider the error mitigating properties of the mapping-which encodes fermionic states into the code space of a stabilizer code. Although there is an implicit tradeoff between low weight representations of local fermionic operators, and high distance code spaces, we argue that fermionic encodings with low-weight representations of local fermionic operators can still exhibit error mitigating properties which can serve a similar role to that played by high code distances. In particular, when undetectable errors correspond to "natural" fermionic noise. We illustrate this point explicitly both for this encoding and the Verstraete-Cirac encoding.

TI Probing the symmetry breaking of a light-matter system by an ancillary
   qubit
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Hybrid quantum systems in the ultrastrong, and even more in the deep-strong, coupling regimes can exhibit exotic physical phenomena and promise new applications in quantum technologies. In these nonperturbative regimes, a qubit-resonator system has an entangled quantum vacuum with a nonzero average photon number in the resonator, where the photons are virtual and cannot be directly detected. The vacuum field, however, is able to induce the symmetry breaking of a dispersively coupled probe qubit. We experimentally observe the parity symmetry breaking of an ancillary Xmon artificial atom induced by the field of a lumped-element superconducting resonator deep-strongly coupled with a flux qubit. This result opens a way to experimentally explore the novel quantum-vacuum effects emerging in the deep-strong coupling regime. Hybrid quantum systems, such as superconducting qubits interacting with microwave photons in resonators, offer a rich platform for exploring fundamental physics. Wang et al. observe parity symmetry breaking in a probe qubit dispersively coupled to a resonator in the deep-strong coupling regime.

TI Filtering out mislabeled training instances using black-box optimization
   and quantum annealing
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB This study proposes an approach for removing mislabeled instances from contaminated training datasets by combining surrogate model-based black-box optimization (BBO) with postprocessing and quantum annealing. Mislabeled training instances, a common issue in real-world datasets, often degrade model generalization, necessitating robust and efficient noise-removal strategies. The proposed method evaluates filtered training subsets based on validation loss, iteratively refines loss estimates through surrogate model-based BBO with postprocessing, and leverages quantum annealing to efficiently sample diverse training subsets with low validation error. Experiments on a noisy majority bit task demonstrate the method's ability to prioritize the removal of high-risk mislabeled instances. Integrating D-Wave's clique sampler running on a physical quantum annealer achieves faster optimization and higher-quality training subsets compared to OpenJij's simulated quantum annealing sampler or Neal's simulated annealing sampler, offering a scalable framework for enhancing dataset quality. This work highlights the effectiveness of the proposed method for supervised learning tasks, with future directions including its application to unsupervised learning, real-world datasets, and large-scale implementations.

TI Recent progress of quantum simulation ofnon-Hermitian systems
SO ACTA PHYSICA SINICA
AB Quantum simulation is one of the main contents of quantum information science, aiming to simulate andinvestigate poorly controllable or unobtainable quantum systems by using controllable quantum systems.Quantum simulation can be implemented in quantum computers, quantum simulators, and small quantumdevices. Non-Hermitian systems have aroused research interest increasingly in recent two decades. On one hand,non-Hermitian quantum theories can be seen as the complex extensions of the conventional quantum mechanics,and are closely related to open systems and dissipative systems. On the other hand, both quantum systems andclassical systems can be constructed as non-Hermitian systems with novel properties, which can be used toimprove the precision of precise measurements. However, a non-Hermitian system is more difficult to simulatethan a Hermitian system in that the time evolution of it is no longer unitary. In this review, we introducerecent research progress of quantum simulations of non-Hermitian systems. We mainly introduce theoreticalresearches to simulate typical non-Hermitian quantum systems by using the linear combinations of unitaries,briefly showing the advantages and limitations of each proposal, and we briefly mention other theoreticalsimulation methods, such as quantum random walk, space embedded and dilation. Moreover, we brieflyintroduce the experimental quantum simulations of non-Hermitian systems and novel phenomena in nuclearmagnetic resonance, quantum optics and photonics, classical systems, etc. The recent progress of thecombinations of quantum simulation and non-Hermitian physics has promoted the development of the non-Hermitian theories, experiments and applications, and expand the scope of application of quantum simulationsand quantum computers

TI A note on a conjecture from distillability of quantum entanglement
SO LINEAR ALGEBRA AND ITS APPLICATIONS
AB A conjecture from the distillability of quantum entanglement is that when A and Bare 4 x 4 trace zero complex matrices and parallel to A parallel to(2)+ parallel to B parallel to(2) = 1/4(where parallel to center dot parallel to is the Frobenius norm), the sum of squares of the largest two singular values of A circle times I-4 + I-4 circle times B does not exceed 1/2. In this paper, the conjecture is proved when

AB Universal quantum algorithms that prepare arbitrary n-qubit quantum states require O(2(n)) gate complexity. The complexity can be reduced by considering specific families of quantum states depending on the task at hand. In particular, multipartite quantum states that are invariant under permutations, e.g. Dicke states, have intriguing properties. In this paper, we consider states invariant under cyclic permutations, which we call cyclic states. We present a quantum algorithm that deterministically prepares cyclic states with gate complexity O(n) without requiring any ancillary qubit. Through both analytical and numerical analyses, we show that our algorithm is more efficient than existing ones.

TI Quantum computing challenges and solutions in software industry-A
   multivocal literature review
SO IET QUANTUM COMMUNICATION
AB Quantum computing (QC) hinged upon the bedrock principles of quantum theory and holds promise for reforming a large number of industries. The researcher in this area aims to deliver a comprehensive understanding of the current state of the art and future trajectories of QC. The authors have discovered that most academic studies have concentrated upon dissecting specific aspects of QC. This discernment underscores the exigency of identifying challenges that might impede the seamless integration of QC within the software industry. Moreover, it becomes crucial to ascertain the panoply of solutions/practices required to overcome these barriers. A comprehensive multi-vocal literature review was performed and culled a total of 49 academic papers for data extraction. A total of 13 challenges encountered by organisations were identified during the adoption of QC. Subsequently, these challenges were examined deeply and determined that five of them are the most critical, these are 'Lack of quantum specific algorithms, dev and testing methodologies', 'Difficult compilation and debugging', 'Lack of development tools and technology', 'Lack of development guidelines & Quality Assurance Standards' and 'Lack of professional expert', together founding over 30% of occurrences. These challenges from various perspectives were evaluated, including time frame, methodology, geographical region and publication platform. To address these barriers and implement the QC in software industry effectively, a total of 53 practices/solutions. This research aims to share valuable knowledge to simplify and amplify quantum application development.

TI Quantum sensing with nonreciprocal couplings
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW APPLIED
AB Nonreciprocity can not only generate quantum resources but can also shield noise and reverse interference from driving signals. We investigate the advantages of nonreciprocal coupling in sensing a driving signal. In general, we find that nonreciprocal coupling performs better than the corresponding reciprocal coupling. And we show that homodyne measurement is the optimal measurement. A single nonreciprocal coupling can increase measurement precision by up to 2 times. With the use of N nonreciprocal couplings in parallel, the measurement precision can be increased by N2 times compared with the corresponding reciprocal coupling. In a nonzero-temperature dissipative environment, we demonstrate that nonreciprocal quantum sensing has greater robustness regarding thermal noise than reciprocal quantum sensing.

TI Entanglement entropy and non-local duality: Quantum channels and quantum
   algebras
SO ANNALS OF PHYSICS
AB We investigate the transformation of entanglement entropy under dualities, using the Kramers-Wannier duality present in the transverse field Ising model as our example. Entanglement entropy between local spin degrees of freedom is not generically preserved by the duality; instead, entangled states may be mapped to states with no local entanglement. To understand the fate of this entanglement, we consider two quantitative descriptions of degrees of freedom and their transformation under duality. The first involves Kraus operators implementing the partial trace as a quantum channel, while the second utilizes the algebraic approach to quantum mechanics, where degrees of freedom are encoded in subalgebras. Using both approaches, we show that entanglement of local degrees of freedom is not lost; instead it is transferred to non-local degrees of freedom by the duality transformation.

TI Large-Scale Simulation of Shor's Quantum Factoring Algorithm
SO MATHEMATICS
AB Shor's factoring algorithm is one of the most anticipated applications of quantum computing. However, the limited capabilities of today's quantum computers only permit a study of Shor's algorithm for very small numbers. Here, we show how large GPU-based supercomputers can be used to assess the performance of Shor's algorithm for numbers that are out of reach for current and near-term quantum hardware. First, we study Shor's original factoring algorithm. While theoretical bounds suggest success probabilities of only 3-4%, we find average success probabilities above 50%, due to a high frequency of "lucky" cases, defined as successful factorizations despite unmet sufficient conditions. Second, we investigate a powerful post-processing procedure, by which the success probability can be brought arbitrarily close to one, with only a single run of Shor's quantum algorithm. Finally, we study the effectiveness of this post-processing procedure in the presence of typical errors in quantum processing hardware. We find that the quantum factoring algorithm exhibits a particular form of universality and resilience against the different types of errors. The largest semiprime that we have factored by executing Shor's algorithm on a GPU-based supercomputer, without exploiting prior knowledge of the solution, is 549,755,813,701 = 712,321 x 771,781. We put forward the challenge of factoring, without oversimplification, a non-trivial semiprime larger than this number on any quantum computing device.

TI Temporal Response of Atoms Trapped in an Optical Dipole Trap: A Primer
   on Quantum Computing Speed
SO ATOMS
AB An atom confined in an optical dipole trap is a promising candidate for a qubit. Analyzing the temporal response of such trapped atoms enables us to estimate the speed at which quantum computers operate. The present work models an atom in an optical dipole trap formed using crossed laser beams and further examines the photoionization time delay from such confined atoms. We study noble gas atoms, such as Ne (Z = 10), Ar (Z = 18), Kr (Z = 36), and Xe (Z = 54). The atoms are considered to be confined in an optical dipole trap using X-ray Free Electron Lasers (XFEL). The present work shows that the photoionization time delay of the trapped atoms is different compared with that of the free atoms. This analysis alerts us that while talking about the speed of quantum computing, the temporal response of the atoms in the trapped environment must also be accounted for.

TI Calibration-independent bound on the unitarity of a quantum channel with
   application to a frequency converter
SO NPJ QUANTUM INFORMATION
AB We report on a method to certify a unitary operation with the help of source and measurement apparatuses whose calibration throughout the certification process needs not be trusted. As in the device-independent paradigm our certification method relies on a Bell test and requires no assumption on the underlying Hilbert space dimension, but it removes the need for high detection efficiencies by including the single additional assumption that non-detected events are independent of the measurement settings. The relevance of the proposed method is demonstrated experimentally by bounding the unitarity of a quantum frequency converter. The experiment starts with the heralded creation of a maximally entangled two-qubit state between a single 40Ca+ ion and a 854 nm photon. Entanglement preserving frequency conversion to the telecom band is then realized with a non-linear waveguide embedded in a Sagnac interferometer. The resulting ion-telecom photon entangled state is assessed by means of a Bell-CHSH test from which the quality of the frequency conversion is quantified. We demonstrate frequency conversion with an average certified fidelity of >= 84% and an efficiency >= 3.1 x 10-6 at a confidence level of 99%. This ensures the suitability of the converter for integration in quantum networks from a trustful characterization procedure.

Here, sum-frequency generation (SFG) between two broadband single photons is experimentally demonstrated by using chirp technology. The results show that the efficiency of the SFG is 6.51 x 10(-8), and the visibility of coherent correlation of two distant broadband photons of the telecommunications band is 93.7%. This technique can also be used for other quantum applications, such as quantum entanglement swapping and quantum communication.

TI Qubit-ADAPT-VQE: An Adaptive Algorithm for Constructing
   Hardware-Efficient Ansatze on a Quantum Processor
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB Quantum simulation, one of the most promising applications of a quantum computer, is currently being explored intensely using the variational quantum eigensolver. The feasibility and performance of this algorithm depend critically on the form of the wave-function ansatz. Recently in Ref. [Nat. Commun. 10, 3007 (2019)], an algorithm termed ADAPT-VQE was introduced to build system-adapted ansatze with substantially fewer variational parameters compared to other approaches. This algorithm relies heavily on a predefined operator pool with which it builds the ansatz. However, Ref. [Nat. Commun. 10, 3007 (2019)] did not provide a prescription for how to select the pool, how many operators it must contain, or whether the resulting ansatz will succeed in converging to the ground state. In addition, the pool used in that work leads to state-preparation circuits that are too deep for a practical application on near-term devices. Here, we address all these key outstanding issues of the algorithm. We present a hardware-efficient variant of ADAPT-VQE that drastically reduces circuit depths using an operator pool that is guaranteed to contain the operators necessary to construct exact ansatze. Moreover, we show that the minimal pool size that achieves this scales linearly with the number of qubits. Through numerical simulations on H-4, LiH and H-6, we show that our algorithm ("qubit-ADAPT") reduces the circuit depth by an order of magnitude while maintaining the same accuracy as the original ADAPT-VQE. A central result of our approach is that the additional measurement overhead of qubit-ADAPT compared to fixed-ansatz variational algorithms scales only linearly with the number of qubits. Our work provides a crucial step forward in running algorithms on near-term quantum devices.

TI Research progress of integrated photonic quantum simulation
SO ACTA PHYSICA SINICA
AB Quantum simulation is to use a controllable quantum system to simulate other complicated or hard-to-control quantum system, and to deal with some complex unknown quantum systems that cannot be simulatedon classical computers due to the exponential explosion of the Hilbert space. Among different kinds of physicalrealizations of quantum simulation, integrated optical systems have emerged as an appropriate platform inrecent years due to the advantages of flexible control, weak decoherence, and no interaction in optical systems.In this review, we attempt to introduce some of the basic models used for quantum simulation in integratedphotonic systems. This review article is organized as follows. In Section 2, we introduce the commonly usedmaterial platforms for integrated quantum simulation, including the silicon-based, lithium niobate-basedintegrated circuits, and the femtosecond laser direct writing optical waveguides. Several integrated opticalplatforms such as the coupled waveguide arrays, photonic crystals, coupled resonator arrays, and multiportinterferometers are also introduced. In Section 3, we focus on the analog quantum simulations in the integratedphotonic platform, including Anderson localization of light in disordered systems, various kinds of topologicalinsulators, nonlinear and non-Hermitian systems. More specifically, in Subsection 3.1, we present the integratedphotonic realizations of disordered and quasi-periodic systems. In Subsection 3.2, we review the integratedphotonic realizations of the topological insulators with and without time-reversal symmetry, including Floquettopological insulators, quantum spin hall system, anomalous quantum hall system, valley hall system, Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) model, and photonic topological Anderson insulators. Besides, topological insulatorlasers and topologically protected quantum photon sources are briefly reviewed. In Subsection 3.3, we review thenonlinear and non-Hermitian integrated optical systems. In Section 4 we present the integrated digital quantumsimulations based on the multiport interferometers, including the discrete-time quantum random walk, Bosonsampling, and molecular simulation. In Section 5, we summarize the content of the article and present theoutlook on the future perspectives of the integrated photonic quantum simulation. We believe that theintegrated photonic platforms will continue to provide an excellent platform for quantum simulation. Morepractical applications will be found based on this system through combining the fields of topological photonics,laser technologies, quantum information, nonlinear and non-Hermitian physics

TI Quantum correlations in electron microscopy
SO OPTICA
AB Electron microscopes provide a powerful platform for exploring physical phenomena with nanoscale resolution, based on the interaction of free electrons with the excitations of a sample such as phonons, excitons, bulk plasmons, and surface plasmons. The interaction usually results in the absorption or emission of such excitations, which can be detected directly through cathodoluminescence or indirectly through electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS). However, as we show here, the underlying interaction of a free electron and an arbitrary optical excitation goes beyond what was predicted or measured so far, due to the interplay of entanglement and decoherence of the electron-excitation system. The entanglement of electrons and optical excitations can provide new analytical tools in electron microscopy. For example, it can enable measurements of optical coherence, plasmonic lifetimes, and electronic length scales in matter (such as the Bohr radius of an exciton). We show how these can be achieved using common configurations in electron diffraction and EELS, revealing significant changes in the electron's coherence, as well as in other quantum information theoretic measures such as purity. Specifically, we find that the purity after interaction with nanopartides can only take discrete val ues, versus a continuum of values for interactions with surface plasmons. We quantify the post-interaction density matrix of the combined electron-excitation system by developing a framework based on macroscopic quantum electrodynamics. The framework enables a quantitative account of decoherence due to excitations in any general polarizable material (optical environment). This framework is thus applicable beyond electron microscopy. Particularly in electron microscopy, our work enriches analytical capabilities and informs the design of quantum information experiments with free electrons, allowing control over their quantum states and their decoherence by the optical environment.

AB Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) is a technology that enables the exchange of private encryption keys between two legitimate parties, using protocols that involve quantum mechanics principles. The rate at which secret keys can be exchanged depends on the attenuation that is experienced. Therefore, it is more convenient to replace many terrestrial fiber segments (and repeaters) by just few optical satellite links that would enable flexible global coverage. Then, the satellite nodes can take the role of trusted-relays, forwarding the secret keys from source to destination. However, since the rate at which secret keys can be generated in each quantum link is limited, it is very important to select the intermediate satellite nodes to inter-connect ground stations efficiently. This paper studies the most convenient allocation of resources in a QKD network that combines complementary connectivity services of GEO and LEO satellites. The aim of the centralized routing algorithm is to select the most convenient trusted-relays to forward the secret keys between pairs of ground stations, verifying the constraints that satellite-to-ground and inter-satellite quantum channels have.

TI Quantum K-nearest neighbor classification algorithm based on
   Hamming distance
SO QUANTUM INFORMATION PROCESSING
AB K-nearest neighbor classification algorithm is one of the most basic algorithms in machine learning, which determines the sample's category by the similarity between samples. In this paper, we propose a quantum K-nearest neighbor classification algorithm with the Hamming distance. In this algorithm, quantum computation is utilized to obtain the Hamming distance in parallel at first. Then, a core sub-algorithm for searching the minimum of unordered integer sequence is presented to find out the minimum distance. Based on these two sub-algorithms, the whole quantum frame of K-nearest neighbor classification algorithm is presented. At last, it is shown that the proposed algorithm can achieve a significant speedup by analyzing its time complexity briefly.

TI Single-state multi-party semiquantum key agreement protocol based on
   multi-particle GHZ entangled states
SO QUANTUM INFORMATION PROCESSING
AB In this paper, we put forward a novel single-state three-party semiquantum key agreement (SQKA) protocol with three-particle GHZ entangled states first. Different with previous quantum key agreement (QKA) protocols, the proposed single-state three-party SQKA protocol can realize the goal that a quantum party and two classical parties who only possess limited quantum capabilities equally contribute to the generation of a shared private key over quantum channels. Detailed security analysis turns out that the proposed single-state three-party SQKA protocol is secure against several famous attacks from an outside eavesdropper, such as the Trojan horse attack, the entangle-measure attack, the measure-resend attack and the intercept-resend attack. Moreover, it can resist the participant attack, which means that the shared private key cannot be determined fully by any nontrivial subset of three parties. The proposed single-state three-party SQKA protocol has the following nice features: (1) it only employs one kind of three-particle GHZ entangled states as initial quantum resource; (2) it does not need pre-shared keys among different parties; (3) it does not need unitary operations or quantum entanglement swapping. Finally, we generalize the proposed single-state three-party SQKA protocol into the case of N-party by only employing one kind of N-particle GHZ entangled states as initial quantum resource, which inherits the nice features of its three-party counterpart.

TI Optimal design and performance evaluation of free-space quantum key
   distribution systems
SO QUANTUM SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB Free-space ground-to-ground links will be an integral part of future quantum communication networks. The implementation of free-space and fiber links in daylight inter-modal configurations is however still hard to achieve, due to the impact of atmospheric turbulence, which strongly decreases the coupling efficiency into the fiber. In this work, we present a comprehensive model of the performance of a free-space ground-to-ground quantum key distribution (QKD) system based on the efficient-BB84 protocol with active decoy states. Our model takes into account the atmospheric channel contribution, the transmitter and receiver telescope design constraints, the parameters of the quantum source and detectors, and the finite-key analysis to produce a set of requirements and optimal design choices for a QKD system operating under specific channel conditions. The channel attenuation is calculated considering all effects deriving from the atmospheric propagation (absorption, beam broadening, beam wandering, scintillation, and wavefront distortions), as well as the effect of fiber-coupling in the presence of a partial adaptive optics correction with finite control bandwidth. We find that the channel fluctuation statistics must be considered to correctly estimate the effect of the saturation rate of the single-photon detectors, which may otherwise lead to an overestimation of the secret key rate. We further present strategies to minimize the impact of diffuse atmospheric background in daylight operation by means of spectral and temporal filtering.

TI The electron density: a fidelity witness for quantum computation
SO CHEMICAL SCIENCE
AB There is currently no combination of quantum hardware and algorithms that can provide an advantage over conventional calculations of molecules or materials. However, if or when such a point is reached, new strategies will be needed to verify predictions made using quantum devices. We propose that the electron density, obtained through experimental or computational means, can serve as a robust benchmark for validating the accuracy of quantum computation of chemistry. An initial exploration into topological features of electron densities, facilitated by quantum computation, is presented here as a proof of concept. Additionally, we examine the effects of constraining and symmetrizing measured one-particle reduced density matrices on noise-driven errors in the electron density distribution. We emphasize the potential benefits and future need for high-quality electron densities derived from diffraction experiments for validating classically intractable quantum computations of materials.

TI Extended quantum process tomography of logical operations on an encoded
   bosonic qubit
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB We demonstrate the use of coherent-state quantum process tomography (csQPT) for a bosonic-mode superconducting circuit. We have enhanced our methodology over previous implementations of csQPT by leveraging Kraus operators and constrained gradient descent to learn the underlying process. We show the results of our method by characterizing a logical quantum gate implemented using displacement and selective numberdependent arbitrary phase operations on an encoded qubit. Our use of csQPT allows for the reconstruction of Kraus operators for the larger Hilbert space rather than being limited to the logical subspace. This approach enables us to more accurately identify and quantify the various error mechanisms that can lead to gate infidelity, including those occurring outside of the computational subspace. We showcase the potential of our approach by demonstrating the ability to quantify leakage outside of the computational subspace, a key factor for developing more robust and reliable quantum gates in high-dimensional systems.

TI Continuous-variable quantum key distribution with noisy squeezed states
SO QUANTUM SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB We address the crucial role of noisy squeezing in security and performance of continuous-variable (CV) quantum key distribution (QKD) protocols. Squeezing has long been recognized for its numerous advantages in CV QKD, such as enhanced robustness against channel noise and loss, and improved secret key rates. However, the excess noise of the squeezed states, that unavoidably originates already from optical loss as well as other imperfections in the source, raises concerns about its potential exploitation by an eavesdropper. For the widely adopted trust assumption on the excess noise in the signal states, we confirm the stability of the protocol against the noisy squeezing in both purely attenuating as well as noisy channels in the asymptotic limit, which implies perfect parameter estimation. In the finite-size regime we show that this stability largely holds at up to 107 data points using optimal biased homodyne detection for key distribution and parameter estimation. Untrusted assumption on the noisy squeezing, on the other hand, introduces additional security bounds on the squeezing excess noise already in the asymptotic regime, which is further enforced by the finite-size effects. Additionally, we show the critical negative role of noisy squeezing in the case of atmospheric free-space channels, already in the trusted-noise and asymptotic assumptions, which emphasizes the importance of squeezing purity in the free-space quantum channels. Our results pave the way towards practical realization of squeezed-state CV QKD protocols in both fibre and free-space channels.

TI Quantum-enhanced multimodal fusion for robust and accurate fake news
   detection
SO SIGMA JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING AND NATURAL SCIENCES-SIGMA MUHENDISLIK VE
   FEN BILIMLERI DERGISI
AB The digital era has witnessed a significant rise in misinformation, underscoring the urgent need for effective tools to distinguish factual news from fabricated content. This study proposes a novel methodology for fake news detection that leverages quantum entanglement to facilitate multimodal fusion of textual, visual, and acoustic data. The quantum entanglement algorithm offers significant advantages in managing high-dimensional data by enabling efficient feature optimization through quantum computing encodings integrated with neural network architectures. The existing quantum circuits for text, visual, and audio would co-occur while witnessing the message from humans to machines with the machines acting as quantum computers integrated with neural networks, specifically designed for fake news detection. The results generated from our method demonstrate significantly improved fake news detection accuracy, and increased accuracy in the noise simulation, and the system is resilient to adversarial methods, all in contrast to typical methods. The proposed Quantum Encoding with Multimodal Fusion (QEMF) framework surpasses existing approaches by offering as it suggests promising future directions to tackle fake news across the web. The system, in a scientific manner, performs a variety of strict pre-processing techniques to all textual data such as tokenization, stemming, and lemmatization, along with sophisticated image pre-processing to all visual data. It uses the latest extracting features, i.e., Glove for text embedding, and conventional convolutional networks, like VGG16, for visual data. The feature representation is significantly enriched through quantum encoding, while the capability of QCNNs to identify the most salient and discriminative features enhances accuracy and ensures robustness against noise and adversarial interference. Furthermore, the system's real-time detection capability and its scalability position it as a powerful tool in combating misinformation within the evolving bio-informational ecosystem.

TI Quantum Key Distribution Overcoming Extreme Noise: Simultaneous Subspace
   Coding Using High-Dimensional Entanglement
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW APPLIED
AB High-dimensional entanglement promises to increase the information capacity of photons and is now routinely generated, exploiting spatiotemporal degrees of freedom of single photons. A curious feature of these systems is the possibility of certifying entanglement despite strong noise in the data. We show that it is also possible to exploit this noisy high-dimensional entanglement for quantum key distribution by introducing a protocol that uses multiple subspaces of the high-dimensional system simultaneously. Our protocol can be used to establish a secret key even in extremely noisy experimental conditions, where qubit protocols fail. To show that, we analyze the performance of our protocol for noise models that apply to the two most commonly used sources of high-dimensional entanglement: time bins and spatial modes.

TI Error Mitigation via Verified Phase Estimation
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB The accumulation of noise in quantum computers is the dominant issue stymieing the push of quantum algorithms beyond their classical counterparts. We do not expect to be able to afford the overhead required for quantum error correction in the next decade, so in the meantime we must rely on low-cost, unscalable error mitigation techniques to bring quantum computing to its full potential. In this paper we present a new error mitigation technique based on quantum phase estimation that can also reduce errors in expectation value estimation (e.g., for variational algorithms). The general idea is to apply phase estimation while effectively postselecting for the system register to be in the starting state, which allows us to catch and discard errors that knock us away from there. We refer to this technique as "verified phase estimation" (VPE) and show that it can be adapted to function without the use of control qubits in order to simplify the control circuitry for near-term implementations. Using VPE, we demonstrate the estimation of expectation values on numerical simulations of intermediate-scale quantum circuits with multiple orders of magnitude improvement over unmitigated estimation at near-term error rates (even after accounting for the additional complexity of phase estimation). Our numerical results suggest that VPE can mitigate against any single errors that might occur; i.e., the error in the estimated expectation values often scale as O(p(2)), where p is the probability of an error occurring at any point in the circuit. This property reveals VPE as a practical technique for mitigating errors in near-term quantum experiments.

TI Realizing topologically ordered states on a quantum processor
SO SCIENCE
AB The discovery of topological order has revised the understanding of quantum matter and provided the theoretical foundation for many quantum error-correcting codes. Realizing topologically ordered states has proven to be challenging in both condensed matter and synthetic quantum systems. We prepared the ground state of the toric code Hamiltonian using an efficient quantum circuit on a superconducting quantum processor. We measured a topological entanglement entropy near the expected value of -ln2 and simulated anyon interferometry to extract the braiding statistics of the emergent excitations. Furthermore, we investigated key aspects of the surface code, including logical state injection and the decay of the nonlocal order parameter. Our results demonstrate the potential for quantum processors to provide insights into topological quantum matter and quantum error correction.

TI Witness-based nonlinear detection of quantum entanglement
SO ISCIENCE
AB We present a nonlinear entanglement detection strategy that detects entanglement that the linear detection strategy fails. We show that when the nonlinear entanglement detection strategy fails to detect the entanglement of an entangled state with two copies, it may succeed with three or more copies. Based on our strategy, cannot be detected by the witness alone. Moreover, our strategy can also be applied to detect multipartite entanglement by using the witnesses for bipartite systems, as well as to entanglement concentrations.

TI Playing Nonlocal Games across a Topological Phase Transition on a
   Quantum Computer
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB Many-body quantum games provide a natural perspective on phases of matter in quantum hardware, crisply relating the quantum correlations inherent in phases of matter to the securing of quantum advantage at a device-oriented task. In this Letter, we introduce a family of multiplayer quantum games for which topologically ordered phases of matter are a resource yielding quantum advantage. Unlike previous examples, quantum advantage persists away from the exactly solvable point and is robust to arbitrary local perturbations, irrespective of system size. We demonstrate this robustness experimentally on Quantinuum's H1-1 quantum computer by playing the game with a continuous family of randomly deformed toric code states that can be created with constant-depth circuits leveraging midcircuit measurements and unitary feedback. We are thus able to tune through a topological phase transition- witnessed by the loss of robust quantum advantage-on currently available quantum hardware. This behavior is contrasted with an analogous family of deformed Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger states, for which arbitrarily weak local perturbations destroy quantum advantage in the thermodynamic limit. Finally, we discuss a topological interpretation of the game, which leads to a natural generalization involving an arbitrary number of players.

TI CHSH Bell tests for optical hybrid entanglement
SO NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB Optical hybrid entanglement can be created between two qubits, one encoded in a single photon and another one in coherent states with opposite phases. It opens the path to a variety of quantum technologies, such as heterogeneous quantum networks, merging continuous- and discrete-variable encoding, and enabling the transport and interconversion of information. However, reliable characterization of the non-local nature of this quantum state is limited so far to full quantum state tomography. Here, we perform a thorough study of Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt Bell inequality tests, enabling practical verification of quantum nonlocality for optical hybrid entanglement. We show that a practical violation of this inequality is possible with simple photon number on/off measurements if detection efficiencies stay above 82%. Another approach, based on photon-number parity measurements, requires 94% efficiency but works well in the limit of higher photon populations. Both tests use no postselection of the measurement outcomes and they are free of the fair-sampling hypothesis. Our proposal paves the way to performing loophole-free tests using feasible experimental tasks such as coherent state interference and photon counting.

TI Controllable Quantum Entanglement and One-Way Steering in a
   Dual-Cavity-Magnon System
SO ANNALEN DER PHYSIK
AB The quantum entanglement and the one-way quantum steering in cavity magnonic system composed of a yttrium iron garnet (YIG) sphere and two microwave cavities, one of which is driven by a two-photon drive field, are studied. Bipartite entanglement, tripartite entanglement, and steering can be achieved under the four-wave mixing process. It is shown that the degree of entanglement and the direction of one-way steering can be manipulated not only by designing the dissipation ratio between the two cavity modes but also by regulating the coherent coupling strength ratio between the two cavity modes and the magnon mode. It is found that the direction of steering is associated with the populations of the two cavity modes, meaning that the mode with a greater population always dominates the steering direction. Especially, the transfer between cavity-magnon entanglement and cavity-cavity entanglement can be realized by adjusting the coupling strengths. The findings provide a practical method for coherently manipulating entanglement and one-way steering in cavity-magnon system.

TI Routing Algorithm Within the Multiple Non-Overlapping Paths' Approach
   for Quantum Key Distribution Networks
SO ENTROPY
AB We develop a novel key routing algorithm for quantum key distribution (QKD) networks that utilizes a distribution of keys between remote nodes, i.e., not directly connected by a QKD link, through multiple non-overlapping paths. This approach focuses on the security of a QKD network by minimizing potential vulnerabilities associated with individual trusted nodes. The algorithm ensures a balanced allocation of the workload across the QKD network links, while aiming for the target key generation rate between directly connected and remote nodes. We present the results of testing the algorithm on two QKD network models consisting of 6 and 10 nodes. The testing demonstrates the ability of the algorithm to distribute secure keys among the nodes of the network in an all-to-all manner, ensuring that the information-theoretic security of the keys between remote nodes is maintained even when one of the trusted nodes is compromised. These results highlight the potential of the algorithm to improve the performance of QKD networks.

TI Regulation of entropic uncertainty relation in correlated channels with
   dephasing colored noise
SO ACTA PHYSICA SINICA
AB The uncertainty principle limits the ability for observer to precisely measure two incompatible observables, and plays a crucial role in quantum precision measurement in the quantum information science. When quantum systems interact with their surroundings, they inevitably result in decoherence, which increases the uncertainty of the system. In the process of quantum information processing, the effective regulation of uncertainty becomes a key problem that needs to be solved. In this work, we investigate the quantum-memory-assisted entropic uncertainty relation of a two-qubit system under correlated channels with dephasing colored noise. We demonstrate that it is possible to control the entropic uncertainty, U , and its lower bound, U b , by combining correlations between successive uses of channels and the non-Markovianity of the dynamical evolution. Firstly, the evolutionary characteristics of the trace distance are employed to distinguish between Markovianity and non-Markovianity of the channel. Subsequently, the system is selected to be either a maximally entangled state or separated state initially. By adjusting the strength eta of the correlations, we find that with the increase of eta , the entropic uncertainty and its lower bound decrease. Especially, if the channel is fully correlated (eta= 1), the entropic uncertainty and its lower bound remain constant under the channel, indicating that decoherence is completely suppressed. A comparison of Markovian channel with non-Markovian channel reveals that the entropic uncertainty and its lower bound exhibit oscillatory behaviour under non-Markovian channels. The combination of correlations and non-Markovianity of the channel demonstrates that the entropic uncertainty and its lower bound can be reduced under fully correlated channels where the non-Markovianity has no effect. This is because fully correlated channels suppress decoherence to a greatest extent. Under partially correlated channels, the combination of correlations and non-Markovianity can more effectively reduce the entropic uncertainty and its lower bound. Under such channels, correlations of the channel reduce the entropic uncertainty and its lower bound during the whole evolution, while the non-Markovianity contributes to their oscillations and reduce them in some specific time. Furthermore, the results show that the entropic uncertainty and its lower bound reach steady values that depend only on the strength of the correlations after long-time evolution. In other words, the stronger the correlations, the lower the entropy uncertainty and its lower bound of steady states will be. Finally, we analyse the physical nature of the decrease of the entropic uncertainty and its lower bound, and it is found that the decrease of the entropic uncertainty and its lower bound originate from the increase of the quantum correlations in the system.

TI Phase-controlled coherent photons for the quantum correlations in a
   delayed-choice quantum eraser scheme
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB The delayed-choice quantum eraser has been intensively studied for the wave-particle duality of a single photon in an interferometric system over the last decades. Super-resolution has been studied over decades for quantum sensing to overcome the standard quantum limit. For the super-resolution, either quantum features of higher-order entangled photon pairs or classical features of phase-controlled coherent photons have been successfully demonstrated. Here, a method of classically excited super-resolution is presented for the phase-controlled coherent photons in a quarter-wave plate-modified quantum eraser scheme. To support the underlying physics of the super-resolution, nonlocal correlation is also presented with an additional frequency-polarization basis control via selective product-basis measurements.

TI Realizing multi-user continuous-variable quantum key distribution via a
   shared entangled source and passive beam splitters
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB Establishing a high-rate, cost-effective, and secure quantum communication network is critical for developing the quantum internet. A promising approach is to place a complex and expensive entangled source at a shared central node, which allows for efficient utilization of quantum resources in constructing a star-shaped downstream quantum access network. In this study, we propose a continuous-variable quantum passive optical network (CV-QPON) that employs a shared entangled source. We evaluate the network's security under two scenarios: one with a fully characterized entangled source and the other with a partially characterized entangled source. Both scenarios involve practical mixed entangled states. By combining the biased basis scheme, the renovated protocol outperforms the previous coherent state protocols in the secret key rate, transmission distance, the number of supported users, and tolerable excess noise. The results indicate that for a fully characterized entangled source, even at a transmission distance of 50 km, a moderate entangled source with 7 dB squeezing can still support up to 256 users accessing the network. Our scheme for a partially characterized entangled source relaxes the security assumptions regarding the central node, which is crucial for the downstream CV-QPON system. In this case, a 7 dB squeezing entangled source achieves a positive key rate for 64 users over a 30 km transmission distance, and it can even support up to 128 users at a 10 km transmission distance. With a 10 dB squeezing entangled source, 256 users can still be supported at a 30 km transmission distance. Furthermore, we analyze the protocol's security in the finite-size scenario and identify an optimal biased basis ratio that maximizes the key rate of the protocol. Given the rapid advancements in integrated entangled sources, our scheme offers a promising pathway for developing low-cost, high-rate, high-security, and large-scale quantum communication networks.

TI Quantum correlations beyond entanglement between two moving atoms
   interacting with a coherent cavity
SO ALEXANDRIA ENGINEERING JOURNAL
AB Studying the ability of atom-photon interactions, especially in two two-level atomic sys-tems, to generate quantum information resources has recently become an important research topic in quantum information science. Therefore, this paper explores the ability of two moving atoms coupling with a coherent field through a two-photon transition to generate atomic quantum corre-lations by using local quantum uncertainty (LQU), local quantum Fisher information (LQFI) as well as logarithmic negativity (LN). Schr6dinger equation is used to obtain the time evolution of the atom-cavity-atom interactions with an initial coherent cavity state and an initial atomic uncor-related pure state. The generation of atomic LQU, LQFI, and LN correlations are exactly examined under the unitary interaction parameter effects, including the atom-cavity coupling strengths, the cavity field half-wave number, and the initial coherent state intensity. The atom-cavity-atom inter-action parameters lead to notable changes in the amplitudes, speed, and regularity of the LQU, LQFI, and LN dynamics, which can be enhanced by increasing the initial coherent intensity. The cavity field half-wave number leads to generating atomic quantum correlations with regular oscil-latory behavior. The sudden death-birth phenomenon of the logarithmic negativity depends on the atom-cavity-atom interaction and the atomic location parameter.(c) 2023 THE AUTHORS.

TI Quantum entanglement and the thermal hadron

This description can be derived from a conjectured minimum free-energy principle, with the entanglement entropy of two-parton subsystems playing the role of thermodynamic entropy. This allows us to calculate the ground-state hadron spectrum and wave function over a wide range of parton masses without solving the Schrodinger equation. We carry out this analysis for certain illustrative models in (1 + 1) dimensions and discuss prospects for higher dimensions.

TI Non-Hermitian CHSH* Game with a Single Trapped-Ion Qubit
SO CHINESE PHYSICS LETTERS
AB The Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt (CHSH) game provides a captivating illustration of the advantages of quantum strategies over classical ones. In a recent study, a variant of the CHSH game leveraging a single qubit system, referred to as the CHSH* game, has been identified. We demonstrate that this mapping relationship between these two games remains effective even for a non-unitary gate. Here we delve into the breach of Tsirelson's bound in a non-Hermitian system, predicting changes in the upper and lower bounds of the player's winning probability when employing quantum strategies in a single dissipative qubit system. We experimentally explore the impact of the CHSH* game on the player's winning probability in a single trapped-ion dissipative system, demonstrating a violation of Tsirelson's bound under the influence of parity-time ( P T ) symmetry. These results contribute to a deeper understanding of the influence of non-Hermitian systems on quantum games and the behavior of quantum systems under P T symmetry, which is crucial for designing more robust and efficient quantum protocols.

TI Parameter-efficient Quantum Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models
   with temporal encoding
SO FUTURE GENERATION COMPUTER SYSTEMS-THE INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ESCIENCE
AB Quantum generative models have attracted growing interest for their potential to transform generative learning through the principles of quantum computing. The recently proposed Quantum Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (QuDDPM) represent a significant advancement by integrating classical diffusion mechanisms with quantum computation. However, QuDDPM suffers from a key scalability bottleneck: its parameter count grows linearly with the number of denoising steps, as each step requires independent optimization. To overcome this limitation, we propose a Temporal-aware Quantum Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Model (TQuDDPM), a parameter-sharing framework that incorporates temporal encoding into the denoising process. Our numerical simulations show that TQuDDPM significantly reduces parameter requirements by up to 94% and training time by up to 90%, all while preserving or even improving generative performance. This work introduces a novel approach to timestep representation in quantum generative learning and demonstrates that TQuDDPM achieves substantial computational efficiency alongside high-fidelity generation.

TI Measuring Arbitrary Physical Properties in Analog Quantum Simulation
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW X
AB A central challenge in analog quantum simulation is to characterize desirable physical properties of quantum states produced in experiments. However, in conventional approaches, the extraction of arbitrary information requires performing measurements in many different bases, which necessitates a high level of control that present-day quantum devices may not have. Here, we propose and analyze a scalable protocol that leverages the ergodic nature of generic quantum dynamics, enabling the efficient extraction of many physical properties. The protocol does not require sophisticated controls and can be generically implemented in analog quantum simulation platforms today. Our protocol involves introducing ancillary degrees of freedom in a predetermined state to a system of interest, quenching the joint system under Hamiltonian dynamics native to the particular experimental platform, and then measuring globally in a single, fixed basis. We show that arbitrary information of the original quantum state is contained within such measurement data and can be extracted using a classical data-processing procedure. We numerically demonstrate our approach with a number of examples, including the measurements of entanglement entropy, many-body Chern number, and various superconducting orders in systems of neutral atom arrays, bosonic and fermionic particles on optical lattices, respectively, only assuming existing technological capabilities. Our protocol excitingly promises to overcome limited controllability and, thus, enhance the versatility and utility of near-term quantum technologies.

TI Tighter Constraints of Multi-Qubit Entanglement in Terms of Nonconvex
   Entanglement Measures LCREN and LCRENoA
SO ENTROPY
AB The monogamy property of entanglement is an intriguing feature of multipartite quantum entanglement. Most entanglement measures satisfying the monogamy inequality have turned out to be convex. Whether nonconvex entanglement measures obey the monogamy inequalities remains less known at present. As a well-known measure of entanglement, the logarithmic negativity is not convex. We elucidate the constraints of multi-qubit entanglement based on the logarithmic convex-roof extended negativity (LCREN) and the logarithmic convex-roof extended negativity of assistance (LCRENoA). Using the Hamming weight derived from the binary vector associated with the distribution of subsystems, we establish monogamy inequalities for multi-qubit entanglement in terms of the alpha th-power (alpha >= 4ln2) of LCREN, and polygamy inequalities utilizing the alpha th-power (0 <=alpha <= 2) of LCRENoA. We demonstrate that these inequalities give rise to tighter constraints than the existing ones. Furthermore, our monogamy inequalities are shown to remain valid for the high-dimensional states that violate the CKW monogamy inequality. Detailed examples are presented to illustrate the effectiveness of our results in characterizing the multipartite entanglement distributions.

TI Testing Scalable Bell Inequalities for Quantum Graph States on IBM
   Quantum Devices
SO IEEE JOURNAL ON EMERGING AND SELECTED TOPICS IN CIRCUITS AND SYSTEMS
AB Testing and verifying imperfect multi-qubit quantum devices are important as such noisy quantum devices are widely available today. Bell inequalities are known to be useful for testing and verifying the quality of the quantum devices from their nonlocal quantum states and local measurements. There have been many experiments demonstrating the violations of Bell inequalities, but they are limited in the number of qubits and the types of quantum states. We report violations of Bell inequalities on IBM Quantum devices based on the scalable and robust inequalities maximally violated by graph states as proposed by Baccari et aL. The violations are obtained from the quantum states of path graphs up to 57 and 21 qubits on a 65-qubit and two 27-qubit IBM Quantum devices, respectively, and from those of star graphs up to 11 qubits with quantum readout error mitigation (QREM). We are able to show violations of the inequalities on various graph states by constructing low-depth quantum circuits and by applying the QREM technique. We also point out that quantum circuits for star graph states of size N can he realized with circuits of depth O(root N) on subdivided honeycomb lattices which are the topology of the 65-qubit IBM Quantum device. Our experiments show encouraging results on the ability of existing quantum devices to prepare entangled quantum states and provide experimental evidence on the benefit of scalable Bell inequalities for testing them.

We discuss how this method can be extended to assume the fault-tolerant implementation of any orthogonal unitary basis of operators, in such a way that each of these bases can be used to implement its own hierarchy of gates. Noticing that all of these hierarchies are defined through the same algebraic construction, we study this construction from a group-theoretic perspective. This allows us to deduce general results concerning all the hierarchies. We also discuss alternative hierarchies, study their properties, and compute some of their first few levels.

TI Verifiable Multiparty Delegated Quantum Computation
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INTELLIGENT SYSTEMS
AB Multiparty delegated quantum computation (MDQC) allows multiple clients with limited quantum capability to jointly complete a quantum computational task with the aid of an untrusted quantum server. But in existing MDQC protocols, the verifiability that clients should verify whether the server executed the protocol correctly and gave correct results was not handled. Therefore, in this paper, we improve a typical MDQC protocol to enable clients to verify the correctness of computation by inserting trap qubits and develop a novel method to enforce clients to send qubits honestly while avoiding the positions of trap qubits being leaked to the server. The security and verifiability of the improved MDQC protocol are also analyzed. In addition, a specific example of the proposed verifiable MDQC protocol is given and simulated on IBM's quantum platform.

TI Efficient low temperature Monte Carlo sampling using quantum annealing
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB Quantum annealing is an efficient technology to determine ground state configurations of discrete binary optimization problems, described through Ising Hamiltonians. Here we show that-at very low computational cost-finite temperature properties can be calculated. The approach is most efficient at low temperatures, where conventional approaches like Metropolis Monte Carlo sampling suffer from high rejection rates and therefore large statistical noise. To demonstrate the general approach, we apply it to spin glasses and Ising chains.

TI Fast reconstruction algorithm based on HMC sampling
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB In Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) era, the scarcity of qubit resources has prevented many quantum algorithms from being implemented on quantum devices. Circuit cutting technology has greatly alleviated this problem, which allows us to run larger quantum circuits on real quantum machines with currently limited qubit resources at the cost of additional classical overhead. However, the classical overhead of circuit cutting grows exponentially with the number of cuts and qubits, and the excessive postprocessing overhead makes it difficult to apply circuit cutting to large scale circuits. In this paper, we propose a fast reconstruction algorithm based on Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) sampling, which samples the high probability solutions by Hamiltonian dynamics from state space with dimension growing exponentially with qubit. Our algorithm avoids excessive computation when reconstructing the original circuit probability distribution, and greatly reduces the circuit cutting post-processing overhead. The improvement is crucial for expanding of circuit cutting to a larger scale on NISQ devices.

AB The recent demonstration of optically active telecom emitters in silicon has paved the way for realizing industrial-scale silicon-based solid-state quantum photonic platforms. The scientific community has been pursuing the implementation of novel single-photon devices for quantum technology applications by introducing extrinsic impurities inside the silicon lattice upon ion implantation. Here we report the optical characterization through single-photon microscopy of intrinsic W centers in high-purity silicon substrates upon carbon implantation and subsequent rapid thermal annealing. The photoluminescence investigation of their emission properties at cryogenic temperatures allowed us to identify the effects of the post-implantation thermal treatment in the formation of telecom quantum emitters based on interstitial silicon clusters upon the introduction of an extrinsic atomic species.

TI Breaking the Rate-Loss Bound of Quantum Key Distribution with
   Asynchronous Two-Photon Interference
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB Twin-field quantum key distribution can overcome the secret key capacity of repeaterless quantum key distribution via single-photon interference. However, to compensate for the channel fluctuations and lock the laser fluctuations, the techniques of phase tracking and phase locking are indispensable in experiment, which drastically increase experimental complexity and hinder free-space realization. We herein present an asynchronous measurement-device-independent quantum key distribution protocol that can surpass the secret key capacity even without phase tracking and phase locking. Leveraging the concept of time multiplexing, asynchronous two-photon Bell-state measurement is realized by postmatching two interference detection events. For a 1 GHz system, the new protocol reaches a transmission distance of 450 km without phase tracking. After further removing phase locking, our protocol is still capable of breaking the capacity at 270 km. Intriguingly, when using the same experimental techniques, our protocol has a higher key rate than the phase-matching-type twin-field protocol. In the presence of imperfect intensity modulation, it also has a significant advantage in terms of the transmission distance over the sending-or-not-sending-type twin-field protocol. With high key rates and accessible technology, our work provides a promising candidate for practical scalable quantum communication networks.

TI Distribution-adaptive dynamic shot optimization for variational quantum
   algorithms
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Variational quantum algorithms (VQAs) have attracted remarkable interest over the past few years because of their potential computational advantages on near-term quantum devices. They leverage a hybrid approach that integrates classical and quantum computing resources to solve high-dimensional problems that are challenging for classical approaches alone. In the training process of variational circuits, constructing an accurate probability distribution for each epoch is not always necessary, creating opportunities to reduce computational costs through shot reduction. However, existing shot allocation methods that capitalize on this potential often lack adaptive feedback or are tied to specific classical optimizers, which limits their applicability to common VQAs and broader optimization techniques. Our observations indicate that the information entropy of a quantum circuit's output distribution exhibits an approximately exponential relationship with the number of shots needed to achieve a target Hellinger distance. In this work, we propose a distribution-adaptive dynamic shot (DDS) framework that efficiently adjusts the number of shots per iteration in VQAs using the entropy distribution from the prior training epoch. Our results demonstrate that the DDS framework sustains inference accuracy while achieving an '50% reduction in average shot count compared to fixed-shot training, and '60% higher accuracy than recently proposed tiered shot allocation methods. Furthermore, in noisy simulations that reflect the error rates of actual IBM quantum systems, DDS achieves an '30% reduction in the total number of shots compared to the fixed-shot method with minimal degradation in accuracy and offers '70% higher computational accuracy than tiered shot allocation methods.

TI Quantum annealer accelerates the variational quantum eigensolver in a
   triple-hybrid algorithm
SO PHYSICA SCRIPTA
AB Hybrid algorithms that combine quantum and classical resources have become commonplace in quantum computing. The variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) is routinely used to solve prototype problems. Currently, hybrid algorithms use no more than one kind of quantum computer connected to a classical computer. In this work, a novel triple-hybrid algorithm combines the effective use of a classical computer, a gate-based quantum computer, and a quantum annealer. The solution of a graph coloring problem found using a quantum annealer reduces the resources needed from a gate-based quantum computer to accelerate VQE by allowing simultaneous measurements within commuting groups of Pauli operators. We experimentally validate our algorithm by evaluating the ground state energy of H2 using different IBM Q devices and the DWave Advantage system requiring only half the resources of standard VQE. Other larger problems we consider exhibit even more significant VQE acceleration. Several examples of algorithms are provided to further motivate a new field of multi-hybrid algorithms that leverage different kinds of quantum computers to gain performance improvements.

TI Universal Qudit Hamiltonians
SO COMMUNICATIONS IN MATHEMATICAL PHYSICS
AB A family of quantum Hamiltonians is said to be universal if any other finite-dimensional Hamiltonian can be approximately encoded within the low-energy space of a Hamiltonian from that family. If the encoding is efficient, universal families of Hamiltonians can be used as universal analogue quantum simulators and universal quantum computers, and the problem of approximately determining the ground-state energy of a Hamiltonian from a universal family is QMA-complete. One natural way to categorise Hamiltonians into families is in terms of the interactions they are built from. Here we prove universality of some important classes of interactions on qudits (d-level systems):
   We completely characterise the k-qudit interactions which are universal, if augmented with arbitrary Hermitian 1-local terms. We find that, for all k >= 2 and all local dimensions d >= 2, almost all such interactions are universal aside from a simple stoquastic class.
   We prove universality of generalisations of the Heisenbergmodel that are ubiquitous in condensed-matter physics, even if free 1-local terms are not provided. We show that the SU(d) and SU(2) Heisenberg interactions are universal for all local dimensions d >= 2 (spin >= 1/2), implying that a quantum variant of the Max-d-Cut problem is QMA-complete. We also show that for d = 3 all bilinear-biquadratic Heisenberg interactions are universal. One example is the general AKLT model.
   We prove universality of any interaction proportional to the projector onto a pure entangled state.

TI Co-Propagation of QKD & 6 Tb/s (60 x 100G) DWDM Channels With ∼17 dBm
   Total WDM Power in Single and Multi-Span Configurations
SO JOURNAL OF LIGHTWAVE TECHNOLOGY
AB We report co-propagation experiments of the quantum channel (at 1310 nm) of a Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) system with Dense Wavelength Division Multiplexing (DWDM) data channels in the 1550 nm range. Two configurations are assessed. The first one is a single span configuration where various lengths of Standard Single Mode Fiber (SSMF) (from 20 to 70 km) are used and the total WDM channels power is varied. The Secure Key Rate (SKR) and the Quantum Bit Error Ratio (QBER) are recorded showing that up to similar to 17 dBm total power of 30 or 60 channels at 100 Gb/s can coexist with the quantum channel. A metric to evaluate the co-propagation efficiency is also proposed to better evaluate the ability of a QKD system to provide secure keys in a co-propagation regime. The second experiment is a three spans link with a cascade of three QKD systems and two trusted nodes in a 184 km total link length. We report the transmission of a coherent 400 Gb/s Dual Polarization DP-16QAM (Quadrature Amplitude Modulation) channel that transports a QKD secured 100 GbE data stream, with other fifty-four 100 Gb/s WDM channels. Encryption is demonstrated at the same time as co-propagation.

TI Silicon Carbide Microring Resonators for Integrated Nonlinear and
   Quantum Photonics Based on Optical Nonlinearities
SO PHOTONICS
AB Silicon carbide (SiC) electronics has seen a rapid development in industry over the last two decades due to its capabilities in handling high powers and high temperatures while offering a high saturated carrier mobility for power electronics applications. With the increased capacity in producing large-size, single-crystalline SiC wafers, it has recently been attracting attention from academia and industry to exploit SiC for integrated photonics owing to its large bandgap energy, wide transparent window, and moderate second-order optical nonlinearity, which is absent in other centrosymmetric silicon-based material platforms. SiC with various polytypes exhibiting second- and third-order optical nonlinearities are promising for implementing nonlinear and quantum light sources in photonic integrated circuits. By optimizing the fabrication processes of the silicon carbide-on-insulator platforms, researchers have exploited the resulting high-quality-factor microring resonators for various nonlinear frequency conversions and spontaneous parametric down-conversion in photonic integrated circuits. In this paper, we review the fundamentals and applications of SiC-based microring resonators, including the material and optical properties, the device design for nonlinear and quantum light sources, the device fabrication processes, and nascent applications in integrated nonlinear and quantum photonics.
