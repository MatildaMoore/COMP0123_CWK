TI Time and classical equations of motion from quantum entanglement via the
   Page and Wootters mechanism with generalized coherent states
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB We draw a picture of physical systems that allows us to recognize what "time" is by requiring consistency with the way that time enters the fundamental laws of Physics. Elements of the picture are two non-interacting and yet entangled quantum systems, one of which acting as a clock. The setting is based on the Page and Wootters mechanism, with tools from large-N quantum approaches. Starting from an overall quantum description, we first take the classical limit of the clock only, and then of the clock and the evolving system altogether; we thus derive the Schrodinger equation in the first case, and the Hamilton equations of motion in the second. This work shows that there is not a "quantum time", possibly opposed to a "classical" one; there is only one time, and it is a manifestation of entanglement. Discussions about the role of time in quantum mechanics are often detached from the corresponding classical limit. Here, the authors provide the Page and Wootters mechanism with a classical limit using the large-N approach based on generalized coherent states, without the need to introduce time measurements.

TI A Comprehensive Cross-Model Framework for Benchmarking the Performance
   of Quantum Hamiltonian Simulations
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON QUANTUM ENGINEERING
AB Quantum Hamiltonian simulation is one of the most promising applications of quantum computing and forms the basis for many quantum algorithms. Benchmarking them is an important gauge of progress in quantum computing technology. We present a methodology and software framework to evaluate various facets of the performance of gate-based quantum computers on Trotterized quantum Hamiltonian evolution. We propose three distinct modes for benchmarking: 1) comparing simulation on a real device to that on a noiseless classical simulator; 2) comparing simulation on a real device with exact diagonalization results; and 3) using scalable mirror circuit techniques to assess hardware performance in scenarios beyond classical simulation methods. We demonstrate this framework on five Hamiltonian models from the HamLib library: the Fermi-Hubbard and Bose-Hubbard models, the transverse-field Ising model, the Heisenberg model, and the Max3SAT problem. Experiments were conducted using Qiskit's Aer simulator, BlueQubit's CPU cluster and GPU simulators, and IBM's quantum hardware. Our framework, extendable to other Hamiltonians, provides comprehensive performance profiles that reveal hardware and algorithmic limitations and measure both fidelity and execution times, identifying crossover points where quantum hardware outperforms CPU/GPU simulators.

TI Dynamics of multipartite quantum steering for different types of
   decoherence channels
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB Multipartite quantum steering, a unique resource for asymmetric quantum network information tasks, is very fragile to the inevitable decoherence, which makes it useless for practical purposes. It is thus of importance to understand how it decays in the presence of noise channels. We study the dynamic behaviors of genuine tripartite steering, reduced bipartite steering, and collective steering of a generalized three-qubit W state when only one qubit interacts independently with the amplitude damping channel (ADC), phase damping channel (PDC) or depolarizing channel (DC). Our results provide the region of decoherence strength and state parameters that each type of steering can survive. The results show that these steering correlations decay the slowest in PDC and some non-maximally entangled states more robust than the maximally entangled ones. Unlike entanglement and Bell nonlocality, the thresholds of decoherence strength that reduced bipartite steering and collective steering can survive depend on the steering direction. In addition, we find that not only one party can be steered by a group system, but also two parties can be steered by a single system. There is a trade-off between the monogamy relation involving one steered party and two steered parties. Our work provides comprehensive information about the effect of decoherence on multipartite quantum steering, which will help to realize quantum information processing tasks in the presence of noise environments.

TI Tightly-integrated quantum-classical computing using the QHDL hardware
   description language
SO FUTURE GENERATION COMPUTER SYSTEMS-THE INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ESCIENCE
AB We present the design, development, and application of QHDL, a quantum hardware description language specifically designed for tightly-coupled quantum-classical computing systems. Together with the language design principles, we describe the QHDL compiler, debugger, and co-simulation infrastructure. We showcase the benefits of using a quantum-classical integrated approach in four use cases, requiring close quantum-classical device interaction: Bell's pair circuit, dynamic delay, Quantum Fourier Transform (QFT), and teleportation. To interface with QHDL, we propose to use synchronous techniques that are commonplace in digital hardware design. We illustrate examples of modeling both loosely-coupled and tightly-coupled quantum circuits that use so-called measurement-in-the-middle by utilizing these techniques in QHDL. For clock-cycle accurate implementations, we propose implementing such classical modules as programmable hardware blocks using Register-Transfer Level (RTL) or gate-level approaches. These approaches provide the highest coupling performance and are feasible to be implemented in state-of-the-art control systems.

TI Bosenovae with quadratically-coupled scalars in quantum sensing
   experiments
SO JOURNAL OF HIGH ENERGY PHYSICS
AB Ultralight dark matter (ULDM) particles of mass m phi less than or similar to 1 eV can form boson stars in DM halos. Collapse of boson stars leads to explosive bosenova emission of copious relativistic ULDM particles. In this work, we analyze the sensitivity of terrestrial and space-based experiments to detect such relativistic scalar ULDM particles interacting through quadratic couplings with Standard Model constituents, including electrons, photons, and gluons. We highlight key differences with searches for linear ULDM couplings. Screening of ULDM with quadratic couplings near the surface of the Earth can significantly impact observations in terrestrial experiments, motivating future space-based experiments. We demonstrate excellent ULDM discovery prospects, especially for quantum sensors, which can probe quadratic couplings orders below existing constraints by detecting bosenova events in the ULDM mass range 10-23 eV less than or similar to m phi less than or similar to 10-5 eV. We also report updated constraints on quadratic couplings of ULDM in case it comprises cold DM.

TI Coherent control with user-defined passage
SO QUANTUM SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB Stimulated Raman adiabatic passage (STIRAP) is a standard technique to combat experimental imperfections and can be used to realize robust quantum state control, which has many applications in physics, chemistry, and beyond. However, STIRAP is susceptible to decoherence since it requires long evolution time. To overcome this problem, stimulated Raman 'user-defined' passage (STIRUP) is proposed, which allows users to design the passages unlike the STIRAP but fast and robust against both decoherence and experimental imperfections. Here, we further develop a more general STIRUP method. Comparing with shortcut to adiabaticity and its' variants, the generalized STIRUP is more simpler and compatible with more complex energy-level structure and many-body systems. Furthermore, the generalized STIRUP has many important applications such as geometric phase measurement, coherent population transfer, and quantum state preparation. Specifically, as examples, we show how to realize the high-fidelity quantum state transfer and entangled state generation in a robust way via STIRUP with the state-of-the-art experimental superconducting circuits.

TI RA-XTNet: A Novel CNN Model to Predict Rheumatoid Arthritis from Hand
   Radiographs and Thermal Images: A Comparison with CNN Transformer and
   Quantum Computing
SO DIAGNOSTICS
AB The aim and objective of the research are to develop an automated diagnosis system for the prediction of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) based on artificial intelligence (AI) and quantum computing for hand radiographs and thermal images. The hand radiographs and thermal images were segmented using a UNet++ model and color-based k-means clustering technique, respectively. The attributes from the segmented regions were generated using the Speeded-Up Robust Features (SURF) feature extractor and classification was performed using k-star and Hoeffding classifiers. For the ground truth and the predicted test image, the study utilizing UNet++ segmentation achieved a pixel-wise accuracy of 98.75%, an intersection over union (IoU) of 0.87, and a dice coefficient of 0.86, indicating a high level of similarity. The custom RA-X-ray thermal imaging (XTNet) surpassed all the models for the detection of RA with a classification accuracy of 90% and 93% for X-ray and thermal imaging modalities, respectively. Furthermore, the study employed quantum support vector machine (QSVM) as a quantum computing approach which yielded an accuracy of 93.75% and 87.5% for the detection of RA from hand X-ray and thermal images. In addition, vision transformer (ViT) was employed to classify RA which obtained an accuracy of 80% for hand X-rays and 90% for thermal images. Thus, depending on the performance measures, the RA-XTNet model can be used as an effective automated diagnostic method to diagnose RA accurately and rapidly in hand radiographs and thermal images.

TI Quantum algorithms for weighted constrained sampling and weighted model
   counting
SO QUANTUM MACHINE INTELLIGENCE
AB We consider the problems of weighted constrained sampling and weighted model counting, where we are given a propositional formula and a weight for each world. The first problem consists of sampling worlds with a probability proportional to their weight given that the formula is satisfied. The latter is the problem of computing the sum of the weights of the models of the formula. Both have applications in many fields such as probabilistic reasoning, graphical models, statistical physics, statistics, and hardware verification. In this article, we propose quantum weighted constrained sampling (QWCS) and quantum weighted model counting (QWMC), two quantum algorithms for performing weighted constrained sampling and weighted model counting, respectively. Both are based on the quantum search/quantum model counting algorithms that are modified to take into account the weights. In the black box model of computation, where we can only query an oracle for evaluating the Boolean function given an assignment, QWCS requires O(2n2+1/WMC)\documentclass[12pt]{minimal} \usepackage{amsmath} \usepackage{wasysym} \usepackage{amsfonts} \usepackage{amssymb} \usepackage{amsbsy} \usepackage{mathrsfs} \usepackage{upgreek} \setlength{\oddsidemargin}{-69pt} \begin{document}$$O(2<^>{\frac{n}{2}}+1/\sqrt{\text {WMC}})$$\end{document} oracle calls, where n is the number of Boolean variables and WMC\documentclass[12pt]{minimal} \usepackage{amsmath} \usepackage{wasysym} \usepackage{amsfonts} \usepackage{amssymb} \usepackage{amsbsy} \usepackage{mathrsfs} \usepackage{upgreek} \setlength{\oddsidemargin}{-69pt} \begin{document}$$\text {WMC}$$\end{document} is the normalized between 0 and 1 weighted model count of the formula, while a classical algorithm has a complexity of Omega(1/WMC)\documentclass[12pt]{minimal} \usepackage{amsmath} \usepackage{wasysym} \usepackage{amsfonts} \usepackage{amssymb} \usepackage{amsbsy} \usepackage{mathrsfs} \usepackage{upgreek} \setlength{\oddsidemargin}{-69pt} \begin{document}$$\Omega (1/\text {WMC})$$\end{document}.

TI Experimental error suppression in Cross-Resonance gates via
   multi-derivative pulse shaping
SO NPJ QUANTUM INFORMATION
AB While quantum circuits are reaching impressive widths in the hundreds of qubits, their depths have not been able to keep pace. In particular, cloud computing gates on multi-qubit, fixed-frequency superconducting chips continue to hover around the 1% error range, contrasting with the progress seen on carefully designed two-qubit chips, where error rates have been pushed towards 0.1%. Despite the strong impetus and a plethora of research, experimental demonstration of error suppression on these multi-qubit devices remains challenging, primarily due to the wide distribution of qubit parameters and the demanding calibration process required for advanced control methods. Here, we achieve this goal, using a simple control method based on multi-derivative, multi-constraint pulse shaping, which acts simultaneously against multiple error sources. Our approach establishes a two to fourfold improvement on the default calibration scheme, demonstrated on four qubits on the IBM Quantum Platform with limited and intermittent access, enabling these large-scale fixed-frequency systems to fully take advantage of their superior coherence times. The achieved CNOT fidelities of 99.7(1)% on those publically available qubits come from both coherent control error suppression and accelerated gate time.

TI Quantum information scrambling in the presence of weak and strong
   thermalization
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Quantum information scrambling under the dynamics of a closed many-body system is of wide interest. The tripartite mutual information (TMI) can quantify the scrambling via its stable negative value under temporal evolution. Here, we study the quench dynamics of the TMI in a nonintegrable Ising model with different initial states in the regimes of strong and weak thermalization. Our numerical results show that the most efficient scrambling can occur when the inverse temperatures of initial states are near zero and in the regime of strong thermalization, and weak thermalization accompanies slow scrambling. We then present an experimental protocol for observing strong and weak thermalization in a one-dimensional array of superconducting qubits, based on which the relation between scrambling and the degree of thermalization revealed in this work can be directly verified by superconducting quantum simulators. The inevitable decoherence effects in real situations are also analyzed, paving the way for faithful quantum simulations on actual experimental platforms.

TI Temporal distinguishability in Hong-Ou-Mandel interference for

SO NPJ QUANTUM INFORMATION
AB High-dimensional quantum entanglement is currently one of the most prolific fields in quantum information processing due to its high information capacity and error resilience. A versatile method for harnessing high-dimensional entanglement has long been hailed as an absolute necessity in the exploration of quantum science and technologies. Here we exploit Hong-Ou-Mandel interference to manipulate discrete frequency entanglement in arbitrary-dimensional Hilbert space. The generation and characterization of two-, four- and six-dimensional frequency entangled qudits are theoretically and experimentally investigated, allowing for the estimation of entanglement dimensionality in the whole state space. Additionally, our strategy can be generalized to engineer higher-dimensional entanglement in other photonic degrees of freedom. Our results may provide a more comprehensive understanding of frequency shaping and interference phenomena, and pave the way to more complex high-dimensional quantum information processing protocols.

TI High-dimensional quantum key distribution using orbital angular momentum
   of single photons from a colloidal quantum dot at room temperature
SO OPTICA QUANTUM
AB High-dimensional quantum key distribution (HDQKD) is a promising avenue to address the inherent limitations of basic quantum key distribution (QKD) protocols. However, experimental realizations of HDQKD to date have relied on indeterministic photon sources that limit the achievable key rate. In this paper, we demonstrate a full emulation of a HDQKD system using a single colloidal giant quantum dot (gQD) as a deterministic, compact, and room-temperature single-photon source (SPS). We demonstrate a practical protocol by encoding information in a high-dimensional space (d =3) of the orbital angular momentum of the photons. Our experimental configuration incorporates two spatial light modulators for encoding and decoding the spatial information carried by individual photons. Our experimental demonstration establishes the feasibility of utilizing high radiative quantum yield gQDs as practical SPSs for HDQKD. We also experimentally demonstrate surpassing the traditional d =2 QKD capacity with comparable error rates, indicating a significant improvement in performance while maintaining reliability.

TI Learning the N-Input Parity Function with a Single-Qubit and
   Single-Measurement Sampling
SO ELECTRONICS
AB The parity problem, a generalization of the XOR problem to higher-dimensional inputs, is a challenging benchmark for evaluating learning algorithms, due to its increased complexity as the number of dimensions of the feature space grows. In this work, a single-qubit classifier is developed, which can efficiently learn the parity function from input data. Despite the qubit model's simplicity, the solution landscape created in the context of the parity problem offers an attractive test bed for exploring optimization methods for quantum classifiers. We propose a new optimization method called Ensemble Stochastic Gradient Descent (ESGD), with which density matrices describing batches of quantum states are incorporated into the loss function. We demonstrate that ESGD outperforms both Gradient Descent and Stochastic Gradient Descent given the aforementioned problem. Additionally, we show that applying ESGD with only one measurement per data input does not lead to any performance degradation. Our findings not only highlight the potential of a single-qubit model, but also offer valuable insights into the use of density matrices for optimization. Further to this, we complement the outcome with interesting results arising by the employment of a Doubly Stochastic Gradient Descent for training quantum variational circuits.

TI Protecting security of quantum neural network with sampling checks
SO FRONTIERS IN PHYSICS
AB With the development of quantum computing, the application of quantum neural networks will be more and more extensive, and its security will also face more challenges. Although quantum communication has high security, quantum neural networks may have many internal and external insecure factors in the process of information transmission, such as noise impact during the preparation of input quantum states, privacy disclosure during transmission, and external attacks on the network structure, which may cause major security incidents. Because of the possible insecurity factors of quantum neural networks, this paper proposes a quantum sampling method to detect the state of quantum neural networks at each stage, so as to judge whether there are security risks in quantum neural networks and thus ensure their security. The method also provides a safe basis for further research on the stability and reliability of quantum neural networks.

TI A general framework for active space embedding methods with applications
   in quantum computing
SO NPJ COMPUTATIONAL MATERIALS
AB We developed a general framework for hybrid quantum-classical computing of molecular and periodic embedding approaches based on an orbital space separation of the fragment and environment degrees of freedom. We demonstrate its potential by presenting a specific implementation of periodic range-separated DFT coupled to a quantum circuit ansatz, whereby the variational quantum eigensolver and the quantum equation-of-motion algorithm are used to obtain the low-lying spectrum of the embedded fragment Hamiltonian. The application of this scheme to study localized electronic states in materials is showcased through the accurate prediction of the optical properties of the neutral oxygen vacancy in magnesium oxide (MgO). Despite some discrepancies in the position of the main absorption band, the method demonstrates competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art ab initio approaches, particularly evidenced by the excellent agreement with the experimental photoluminescence emission peak.

TI Stochastic action for the entanglement of a noisy monitored two-qubit
   system
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB We study the effect of local unitary noise on the entanglement evolution of a two-qubit system subject to local monitoring and interqubit coupling by constructing a suitable stochastic path integral based on the ChantasriDressel-Jordan formalism. From this, we identify the optimal entanglement dynamics and deploy a diagrammatic method to find a closed-form approximation for the evolution of the average squared concurrence. We find that the optimal trajectory and diagrammatic expansion capture the oscillations of entanglement at short times. A separate numerical analysis of the long-time steady-state entanglement reveals a nonmonotonic relationship between the concurrence and noise strength.

TI Abatement of ionizing radiation for superconducting quantum devices
SO JOURNAL OF INSTRUMENTATION
AB Ionizing radiation has been shown to reduce the performance of superconducting quantum circuits. In this report, we evaluate the expected contributions of different sources of ambient radioactivity for typical superconducting qubit experiment platforms. Our assessment of radioactivity inside a typical cryostat highlights the importance of selecting appropriate materials for the experiment components nearest to qubit devices, such as packaging and electrical interconnects. We present a shallow underground facility (30-meter water equivalent) to reduce the flux of cosmic rays and a lead shielded cryostat to abate the naturally occurring radiogenic gamma-ray flux in the laboratory environment. We predict that superconducting qubit devices operated in this facility could experience a reduced rate of correlated multi-qubit errors by a factor of approximately 20 relative to the rate in a typical above-ground, unshielded facility. Finally, we outline overall design improvements that would be required to further reduce the residual ionizing radiation rate, down to the limit of current generation direct detection dark matter experiments.

TI Hybrid MPPM-BB84 Quantum Key Distribution Over FSO Channel Considering
   Atmospheric Turbulence and Pointing Errors
SO IEEE PHOTONICS JOURNAL
AB Nowadays, a high level of security is required for the transmission of critical information. Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) systems are considered the best option to protect such information. Many studies have shown the efficiency of the QKD optical fiber inspired by M-ary pulse position modulation (MPPM). Free-Space Optical (FSO) links provide an efficient and effective data transmission system. However, cumulative effects of laser beam divergence, misalignment, and turbulence-induced fading on the received irradiance in the FSO link might allow an external eavesdropper located near the authorized receiver to break the transmission under certain conditions. This paper introduces the development of an FSO system based on the MPPM and the BB84 protocol (MPPM-BB84) over the Gamma-Gamma (GG) turbulence channel with pointing errors. Time Binning is implemented using MPPM to increase system security and reduce the quantum bit error rate (QBER). The system security is investigated under photon number splitting attack and excess noise. Closed-form expressions for asymptotic expressions of the average symbol error probability (SER), raw key rate (RKR), and secret key rate (SKR) are introduced. Moreover, the Monte-Carlo simulations are then used to prove the validity of the analytical results. The optimal values for the average photon number per pulse (to achieve the maximum RKR and SKR) for each symbol length can guarantee the stability of the FSO system under different weather conditions. Smaller symbol lengths are more tolerant of detector loss. The proposed system supports linking distances from 1 km to 3 km while keeping the SKR almost constant.

TI Exploiting the higher-order statistics of random-coefficient pure states
   for quantum information processing
SO QUANTUM INFORMATION PROCESSING
AB Quantum mechanics and hence quantum information processing methods widely use two types of states, namely (deterministic-coefficient) pure states and statistical mixtures. Density operators can be associated with them. We here address a third type of states, whose ket coefficients are random variables, as opposed to the deterministic coefficients of usual pure states. We therefore call them Random-Coefficient Pure States, or RCPS. We define physical setups that yield RCPS. We analyze the properties of RCPS and show that they contain much richer information than the density operator and mean of observables that we associate with them , because that operator only exploits the second-order statistics of the random state coefficients, whereas their higher-order statistics contain additional information. That information can be accessed in practice with the multiple-preparation procedure that we propose for RCPS, by using second-order and higher-order statistics of associated random probabilities of measurement outcomes. Exploiting these higher-order statistics yields a very general approach to advanced quantum information processing. We illustrate its relevance with a generic quantum parameter estimation problem related to quantum process tomography , especially considering its blind/unsupervised version. We show that this problem cannot be solved by using only the density operator rho of an RCPS and the associated mean value Tr (rho(A) over cap) of the operator (A) over cap corresponding to the consiered physical quantity. We solve it by exploiting a fourth-order statistical parameter of state coefficients, in addition to second-order statistics. Numerical tests validate this result and show that the proposed method yields accurate parameter estimation for the considered number of state preparations.

TI Heralded Nondestructive Quantum Entangling Gate with Single-Photon
   Sources
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB Heralded entangling quantum gates are an essential element for the implementation of large-scale optical quantum computation. Yet, the experimental demonstration of genuine heralded entangling gates with free-flying output photons in linear optical system, was hindered by the intrinsically probabilistic source and double-pair emission in parametric down-conversion. Here, by using an on-demand single-photon source based on a semiconductor quantum dot embedded in a micropillar cavity, we demonstrate a heralded controlled-NOT (CNOT) operation between two single photons for the first time. To characterize the performance of the CNOT gate, we estimate its average quantum gate fidelity of (87.8 +/- 1.2)%. As an application, we generated event-ready Bell states with a fidelity of (83.4 +/- 2.4)%. Our results are an important step towards the development of photon-photon quantum logic gates.

TI Scalable multiphoton generation from cavity-synchronized single-photon
   sources
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB We propose an efficient, scalable, and deterministic scheme to generate multiple indistinguishable photons over independent channels, on demand. Our design relies on multiple single-photon sources, each coupled to a waveguide, all interacting with a common cavity mode. The cavity synchronizes and triggers the simultaneous emission of one photon by each source, which are collected by the waveguides. In a state-of-the-art circuit QED implementation, this scheme supports the creation of single photons with 99% purity, indistinguishability, and efficiency at rates of MHz. We also discuss conditions to produce up to 100 photons simultaneously with generation rates of hundreds of kHz. This is orders of magnitude more efficient than previous demultiplexed sources for boson sampling and enables the realization of deterministic multiphoton sources and scalable quantum information processing with photons.

TI Protecting operations on qudits from noise by continuous dynamical
   decoupling
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB We develop a procedure of generalized continuous dynamical decoupling (GCDD) for an ensemble of d-level systems (qudits), allowing one to protect the action of an arbitrary multiqudit gate from general noise. We first present our GCDD procedure for the case of an arbitrary qudit and apply it to the case of a Hadamard gate acting on a qutrit. This is done using a model that, in principle, could be implemented using the three magnetic hyperfine states of the ground energy level of Rb-87 and laser beams whose intensities and phases are modulated according to our prescription. We show that this model allows one to generate continuously all the possible SU(3) group operations which are, in general, needed to apply the GCDD procedure. We finally show that our method can be extended to the case of an ensemble of qudits, identical or not.

TI Rotational-invariant quantum key distribution based on a quantum dot
   source
SO OPTICA QUANTUM
AB Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) is a cutting-edge field that leverages the principles of quantum mechanics to enable secure communication between parties involved. Single-photon quantum emitters offer remarkable on-demand photon emission, near-unitary indistinguishability, and low multiphoton generation, thereby enhancing the performance of QKD protocols. Standard approaches in which the polarization degree-of-freedom is exploited are limited by the precise alignment between the communicating parties. To overcome this obstacle, the Orbital Angular Momentum (OAM) of light represents a suitable candidate for encoding the information, as it allows the implementation of rotational-invariant photonic states that remove the need for a fixed physical reference frame between the communicating parties. Here, we demonstrate an alignment-free BB84 implementation using on-demand single photons from a quantum-dot emitter at 925 nm. Time-to-spatial demultiplexing and Q-plates encode rotationally invariant spin-orbit states that we transmit over a 2 m free-space link while rotating the receiver between 0 degrees and 90 degrees. The source exhibits g((2))(0) approximate to 0.03; the measured QBER remains (4.04 +/- 0.02)% and is essentially independent of the relative angle. A simple security model tailored to sub-Poissonian emission, which explicitly incorporates g((2))(0), yields a positive asymptotic secret fraction and an effective QBER threshold of similar to 9.6% under our conditions. These results validate rotationally invariant QKD with an on-demand single-photon source and outline its scalability to long-distance scenarios.

TI Estimating the energy threshold of phonon-mediated superconducting qubit
   detectors operated in an energy-relaxation sensing scheme
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW D
AB In recent years, the lack of a conclusive detection of weakly interacting massive particle dark matter at the 10 GeV/c2 mass scale and above has encouraged development of low-threshold detector technology aimed at probing lighter dark matter candidates. Detectors based on Cooper-pair-breaking sensors have emerged as a promising avenue for this detection due to the low (meV-scale) energy required for breaking a Cooper pair in most superconductors. Among them, devices based on superconducting qubits are interesting candidates for sensing due to their observed sensitivity to broken Cooper pairs. We have developed an end-to-end G4CMP-based simulation framework and have used it to evaluate performance metrics of qubit-based devices operating in a gate-based "energy relaxation" readout scheme, akin to those used in recent studies of qubit sensitivity to ionizing radiation. We find that for this readout scheme, the qubit acts as a phonon sensor with an energy threshold ranging down to <^>0.4 eV for near-term performance parameters.

AB As past works have shown, information-theoretically secure implementations transmitters of Y00 quantum noise randomised cypher are possible. An advance to the provably secure Y00 protocol by bridging gaps between experimental results and theoretical analyses under so-called quantum collective measurement attacks with known plaintexts is aimed. It would be the strongest attack on the Y00 protocol in the context of quantum key distribution protocols. However, recently proposed security evaluations under the attacks were too abstract to apply to experiments. Therefore, security analyses directly evaluable with the equipped Y00 transmitters under attack are offered. Thus, new security indices are proposed instead of ordinary security measures, such as the bit-error-rate guarantee between optical signals or a masking size. Contrarily, unsolved problems are also listed.

AB We compare schemes for testing whether two parties share a two-qubit singlet state. The first, standard, scheme tests Braunstein-Caves (or CHSH) inequalities, comparing the correlations of local measurements drawn from a fixed finite set against the quantum predictions for a singlet. The second, alternative, scheme tests the correlations of local measurements, drawn randomly from the set of those that are theta-separated on the Bloch sphere, against the quantum predictions. We formulate each scheme as a hypothesis test and then evaluate the test power in a number of adversarial scenarios involving an eavesdropper altering or replacing the singlet qubits. We find the 'random measurement' test to be superior in most natural scenarios.

Can this out-of-equilibrium quasiparticle density still possess an energy distribution in equilibrium with the phonon bath? Here, we answer this question affirmatively by measuring the thermal activation of charge-parity switching in a transmon qubit with a difference in superconducting gap on the two sides of the Josephson junction. We then demonstrate how the gap asymmetry of the device can be exploited to manipulate its parity.

SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB We study Floquet systems with translationally invariant nearest-neighbor two-site gates. Depending on the order in which the gates are applied on an N-site system with periodic boundary conditions, there are factorially many different circuit configurations. We prove that there are only N - 1 different spectrally equivalent classes, which can be viewed either as a generalization of the brick wall or of the staircase configuration. Every class, characterized by two integers, has a nontrivial space-time symmetry with important implications for the levelspacing distribution-a standard indicator of quantum chaos. Namely, in order to study chaoticity one should not look at eigenphases of the Floquet propagator itself, but rather at the spectrum of an appropriate root of the propagator.

AB Quantum -limited Josephson parametric amplifiers play a pivotal role in advancing the field of circuit quantum electrodynamics by enabling the fast and high-fidelity measurement of weak microwave signals. Therefore, it is necessary to develop robust parametric amplifiers with low noise, broad bandwidth, and reduced design complexity for microwave detection. However, current broadband parametric amplifiers either have degraded noise performance or rely on complex designs. Here, we present a device based on the broadband impedancetransformed Josephson parametric amplifier that integrates a hornlike coplanar waveguide transmission line, which significantly decreases the design and fabrication complexity while keeping comparable performance. The device shows an instantaneous bandwidth of 700 (200) MHz for 15 (20) dB gain with an average input saturation power of -110 dBm and near quantum -limited added noise. The operating frequency can be tuned over 1.4 GHz using an external flux bias. We further demonstrate the negligible backaction from our device on a transmon qubit. The amplification performance and simplicity of our device promise its wide adaptation in quantum metrology, quantum communication, and quantum information processing.

TI Reconstructing Complex States of a 20-Qubit Quantum Simulator
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB A prerequisite to the successful development of quantum computers and simulators is precise under-standing of the physical processes occurring therein, which can be achieved by measuring the quantum states that they produce. However, the resources required for traditional quantum state estimation scale exponentially with the system size, highlighting the need for alternative approaches. Here, we demon-strate an efficient method for reconstruction of significantly entangled multiqubit quantum states. Using a variational version of the matrix-product-state ansatz, we perform the tomography (in the pure-state approximation) of quantum states produced in a 20-qubit trapped-ion Ising-type quantum simulator, using the data acquired in only 27 bases, with 1000 measurements in each basis. We observe superior state -reconstruction quality and faster convergence compared to the methods based on neural-network quantum state representations: restricted Boltzmann machines and feed-forward neural networks with autoregres-sive architecture. Our results pave the way toward efficient experimental characterization of complex states produced by the quench dynamics of many-body quantum systems.

TI Hybrid ground-state quantum algorithms based on neural Schrödinger
   forging
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Entanglement forging based variational algorithms leverage the bipartition of quantum systems for addressing ground-state problems. The primary limitation of these approaches lies in the exponential summation required over the numerous potential basis states, or bitstrings, when performing the Schmidt decomposition of the whole system. To overcome this challenge, we propose a method for entanglement forging employing generative neural networks to identify the most pertinent bitstrings, eliminating the need for the exponential sum. Through empirical demonstrations on systems of increasing complexity, we show that the proposed algorithm achieves comparable or superior performance compared to the existing standard implementation of entanglement forging. Moreover, by controlling the amount of required resources, this scheme can be applied to larger as well as non-permutation-invariant systems, where the latter constraint is associated with the Heisenberg forging procedure. We substantiate our findings through numerical simulations conducted on spin models exhibiting one-dimensional rings, two-dimensional triangular lattice topologies, and nuclear shell model configurations.

TI Sb2S3/AlGaAs-based reconfigurable metasurface for
   dynamic polarization and directionality control of quantum emitter
   emission
SO RSC ADVANCES
AB In this article, we report, to the best of our knowledge, for the first time, phase change material (PCM)-based reconfigurable metasurfaces for tailoring different degrees of freedom (DoF) of the quantum emitter (QE) emission, namely polarization and directionality, two key controlling factors in applications such as quantum computing, communication, and chiral optics. We have used a hybrid plasmon-QE coupled bullseye grating system utilizing the unexplored concept of composite nano-antennas in quantum photonics as the basic building block of the structures. Carefully engineered azimuthal width profile of the Sb2S3/AlGaAs composite ridge and selectively controlled transition of PCM (Sb2S3) states provide dynamic control over the amplitude and phase of the scattered radiation. Based on this methodology, we have designed five different metasurfaces for on-demand switching of target DoFs of QE emission, ensuring high collection efficiency due to the near-field coupling scheme. The first two metasurfaces switch the majority of the outgoing radiation from radially polarized to circularly polarized, whereas the next two switch the direction of circularly polarized outgoing radiation by a maximum of 9.23 degrees while maintaining the spin state (or polarization chirality) in the simulation environment. The third metasurface category is capable of on-demand generation and separation of opposite spin states of outgoing radiation by 11.48 degrees utilizing the selectively controlled phase transition of Sb2S3. Such reconfigurable multi-dimensional manipulation of QE radiation has not been investigated previously. This work proves the vast potential of active metasurfaces to modify the DoFs of QE emission, paving the way for high-dimensional quantum sources for high-speed quantum communication, higher dimensional quantum processing, and switchable chiral optics.

TI Strain tunable quantum emission from atomic defects in hexagonal boron
   nitride for telecom-bands
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB This study presents extending the tunability of 2D hBN Quantum emitters towards telecom (C-band - 1530 to 1560 nm) and UV-C (solar blind - 100 to 280 nm) optical bands using external strain inducements, for long- and short-range quantum communication (Quantum key distribution (QKD)) applications, respectively. Quantum emitters are the basic building blocks of this QKD (quantum communication or information) technologies, which need to emit single photons over room temperature and capable of tuning the emission wavelength to the above necessary range. Recent literature revealed that quantum emitters in 2D hBN only has the ability to withstand at elevated temperatures and aggressive annealing treatments, but density functional theory (DFT) predictions stated that hBN can only emit the single photons from around 290 to 900 nm (UV to near-IR regions) range. So, there is a need to engineer and further tune the emission wavelength of hBN quantum emitters to the above said bands (necessary for efficient QKD implementation). One of the solutions to tune the emission wavelength is by inducing external strain. In this work, we examine the tunability of quantum emission in hBN with point defects by inducing three different normal strains using DFT computations. We obtained the tunability range up to 255 nm and 1589.5 nm, for the point defects viz boron mono vacancies (V-B) and boron mono vacancies with oxygen atoms (VBO2) respectively, which can enhance the successful implementation of the efficient QKD. We also examine the tunability of the other defects viz. nitrogen mono vacancies, nitrogen mono vacancy with self-interstitials, nitrogen mono vacancy with carbon interstitials, carbon dimers and boron dangling bonds, which revealed the tunable quantum emission in the visible, other UV and IR spectrum ranges and such customized quantum emission can enhance the birth of other quantum photonic devices.

TI Device-independent quantum key distribution based on Bell inequalities
   with more than two inputs and two outputs
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Device-independent quantum key distribution (DI-QKD) offers the strongest form of security against eavesdroppers bounded by the laws of quantum mechanics. However, a practical implementation is still pending due to the requirement of combinations of visibility and detection efficiency that are beyond those possible with current technology. This mismatch motivates the search for DI-QKD protocols that can close the gap between theoretical and practical security. In this work, we present two DI-QKD protocols whose security relies on Bell inequalities with more than two inputs and two outputs. We show that, for maximally entangled states and perfect visibility, a protocol based on a Bell inequality with three inputs and four outputs requires a slightly lower detection efficiency than the protocols based on Bell inequalities with two inputs and two outputs.

TI Bipartite mechanical systems of a laser-driven optomechanical cavity
SO RESULTS IN OPTICS
AB We investigate the correlation of mechanical systems of nondegenerate three-level laser with parametric oscillator in optomechanical cavity coupled to a two-mode squeezed vacuum reservoir. The quantum properties of the mechanical systems as a result of the correlation have been analyzed using the expectation values of mechanical mode variables at steady state and the eigenvalues of the reduced covariance matrix of the two sub-mechanical systems. The logarithmic negativity, steerability, and quantum discord criterion for entanglement, steerability, and quantum discord, respectively confirm that bipartite sub-mechanical systems are correlated. The results show that the bipartite sub-mechanical systems exhibit entanglement two-way steering and nonclassical correlation or quantum discord. Moreover, the sub-mechanical system exhibits squeezing in the minus quadrature or momentum. The correlation properties of sub-mechanical systems are depend on the reservoir but the cavity laser has no effect on the quantum correlation of the sub-mechanical systems.

TI Husimi phase distribution in non-Gaussian operations
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB The Husimi phase distribution, an experimentally measurable quantity, is investigated for single-mode and two-mode squeezed vacuum states. The analysis highlights that non-Gaussian operations, i.e., photon subtraction (PS), photon addition (PA), and photon catalysis (PC), are effective tools for localizing phase distribution and enhancing phase robustness in the presence of noise, while PC results in comparatively slower delocalization accompanied by more intricate phase features. The work highlights the perspective that the combined effects of squeezing, beam-splitter transmittance, and environmental interactions must be carefully considered when quantum state engineering protocols are designed, and phase properties provide a valuable insight into this endeavor.

TI Coupled superconducting spin qubits with spin-orbit interaction
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
AB Superconducting spin qubits, also known as Andreev spin qubits, promise to combine the benefits of super-conducting qubits and spin qubits defined in quantum dots. While most approaches to control these qubits rely on controlling the spin degree of freedom via the supercurrent, superconducting spin qubits can also be coupled to each other via the superconductor to implement two-qubit quantum gates. We theoretically investigate the interaction between superconducting spin qubits in the weak tunneling regime and concentrate on the effect of spin-orbit interaction (SOI), which can be large in semiconductor-based quantum dots and thereby offers an additional tuning parameter for quantum gates. We find analytically that the effective interaction between two superconducting spin qubits consists of Ising, Heisenberg, and Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interactions and can be tuned by the superconducting phase difference, the tunnel barrier strength, or the SOI parameters. The Josephson current becomes dependent on SOI and spin orientations. We demonstrate that this interaction can be used for fast controlled phase-flip gates with a fidelity > 99.99%. We propose a scalable network of superconducting spin qubits which is suitable for implementing the surface code.

AB Several important models of machine learning algorithms have been successfully generalized to the quantum world, with potential speedup to training classical classifiers and applications to data analytics in quantum physics that can be implemented on the near future quantum computers. However, quantum noise is a major obstacle to the practical implementation of quantum machine learning. In this work, we define a formal framework for the robustness verification and analysis of quantum machine learning algorithms against noises. A robust bound is derived and an algorithm is developed to check whether or not a quantum machine learning algorithm is robust with respect to quantum training data. In particular, this algorithm can find adversarial examples during checking. Our approach is implemented on Google's TensorFlow Quantum and can verify the robustness of quantum machine learning algorithms with respect to a small disturbance of noises, derived from the surrounding environment. The effectiveness of our robust bound and algorithm is confirmed by the experimental results, including quantum bits classification as the "Hello World" example, quantum phase recognition and cluster excitation detection from real world intractable physical problems, and the classification of MNIST from the classical world.

TI Catalysis in action via elementary thermal operations
SO NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB We investigate catalysis in the framework of elementary thermal operations (ETOs), leveraging the distinct features of such operations to illuminate catalytic dynamics. As groundwork, we establish new technical tools that enhance the computability of state transition rules for ETOs. Specifically, we provide a complete characterisation of state transitions for a qutrit system and special classes of initial states of arbitrary dimension. By employing these tools in conjunction with numerical methods, we find that by adopting a small catalyst, including just a qubit catalyst, one can significantly enlarge the set of state transitions for a qutrit system. This advancement notably narrows the gap of reachable states between ETOs and generic thermal operations. Furthermore, we decompose catalytic transitions into time-resolved evolution, which critically enables the tracking of nonequilibrium free energy exchanges between the system and bath. Our results provide evidence for the existence of simple and practicable catalytic advantage in thermodynamics while offering insight into analysing the mechanism of catalytic processes.

AB Lawful interception is a mandatory service for any communication service provider that allows law enforcement agencies to intercept subscribers' traffic when a court order is in place. ETSI clearly specifies and standardises these systems, including security requirements, interfaces, and components. The risk of exposure of the sensitive and classified information that it is managed demands high-security solutions, including those that should address the potential risk of quantum computers breaking cryptography. This paper proposes to address this new risk by integrating Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) and Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC) technologies into the lawful interception architecture. These ideas have been evaluated in an open-source implementation, adapting the interfaces to use PQC.

TI Quasiparticle Dynamics in a Superconducting Qubit Irradiated by a
   Localized Infrared Source
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB A known source of decoherence in superconducting qubits is the presence of broken Cooper pairs, or quasiparticles. These can be generated by high-energy radiation, either present in the environment or purposefully introduced, as in the case of some hybrid quantum devices. Here, we systematically study the properties of a transmon qubit under illumination by focused infrared radiation with various powers, durations, and spatial locations. Despite the high energy of incident photons, our observations agree well with a model of low-energy quasiparticle dynamics dominated by trapping. This technique can be used for understanding and potentially mitigating the effects of high-energy radiation on superconducting circuits with a variety of geometries and materials.

AB Microwave control of trapped ions can provide an implementation of high-fidelity two-qubit gates free from errors induced by photon scattering. Furthermore, microwave conductors may be embedded into a scalable trap structure, providing the chip-level integration of control that is desirable for scaling. Recent developments have demonstrated how amplitude modulation of the gate drive can permit a two-qubit entangling operation to become robust against motional mode noise and other experimental imperfections. Here, we discuss a method for the numerical optimization of the microwave pulse envelope to produce gate pulses with noise resilience, considerably faster operation and high energy efficiency.

AB Josephson Junctions are important components in superconducting qubits. It introduces anharmonicity to the energy level spacings of the qubit which allow us to identify two unique quantum energy states for computing. It is difficult to fabricate multiple junctions within the same desired parameter range. Characterisation of the junctions is, therefore, a necessary step after fabrication. In particular, the critical current of the junctions is determined by measuring their normal state resistance. This is done via two-point or four-point resistance measurement at a manual probe station which is a time-consuming process, especially for wafer-scale fabrication. This bottleneck can be circumvented by automation with object detection. The base of the automated probe station is a 3D printer modified with multiple Arduino Uno microcontrollers and motorized linear stages. The automation process is achieved via auto-alignment of the probes and an automatic measurement procedure. As a result, the fully automated process will take about 27-29s to measure the resistance of one junction which saves 28%-51% of the time compared to the manual probe station and can be unsupervised. Due to the reuse of a commercial 3D printer, the cost of this system is 800 SGD which is much less than comparable commercial solutions.

TI Optimal connectivity from idle-qubit residual-coupling crosstalk in a
   cavity-mediated entangling gate
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Quantum processors operated through long-range interaction mediated by a microwave resonator have been envisioned to allow for high connectivity. The ability to selectively operate qubits rely on the possibility to dynamically suppress the coupling between each qubit and the resonator, however, there always remains a residual coupling. In this article, we investigate the effect of high processor connectivity on average two-qubit gate fidelity in a cavity-based architecture with tunable coupling. Via a perturbative approach, we quantify the crosstalk errors from transverse residual couplings and show that they scale as nm2 where n is the number of idle qubits and m is the ratio between the transverse residual and active couplings. Setting an error threshold Ethr, we demonstrate that crosstalks restrict the hardware topology and prevent the full use of all-to-all connectivity. We predict that the maximum number of qubits allowed by Ethr scales as n proportional to Ethr/m2.

TI Quantum algorithm for twin extreme learning machine
SO PHYSICA SCRIPTA
AB Twin extreme learning machine (TELM) is a powerful learning algorithm, which aims at learning two nonparallel hyperplanes for data classification. However, classical TELM algorithm becomes computationally expensive when it involves big data sets. In this paper, we devise a quantum TELM algorithm to address this issue. Specifically, we first utilize the quantum amplitude estimation algorithm to prepare the desired input states and then call the quantum linear systems of equations, which adopts block-encoding technique, to obtain the model parameters in the training process. Then we invoke the swap test to estimate the distances from a new data point to the two hyperplanes and then make a classification in the prediction stage. The final complexity analysis demonstrates that our algorithm has an exponential speedup under certain conditions over the classical counterpart.

TI Qubit measurements for testing contextuality through the violation of
   Liang-Spekkens-Wiseman-Yu-Oh inequality
SO NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB Contextuality is a striking feature of our nature predicted by quantum theory and tested by various experiments. In a qubit system, testing contextuality requires scenarios distinct from traditional ones for systems with dimension of three or greater. In this paper, we consider the noncontextuality inequality developed by Liang-Spekkens-Wiseman and Yu-Oh, and investigate the set of three qubit measurements that can be used to test and violate this inequality. Our numerical results show that two of the three measurements can be almost arbitrary. Moreover, we have singled out several extremely interesting sets of measurements, e.g. one measurements can be white noise while the other two are arbitrarily close to white noise. These sets fulfill our knowledge about contextuality in this minimum quantum system.

TI Underwater Animal Identification and Classification Using a Hybrid
   Classical-Quantum Algorithm
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB Underwater Animal Identification and Classification is gaining significant importance in recent times due to the growing demand for ecological surveillance and biodiversity monitoring. Classical Deep learning techniques have been prominently used for these tasks, but due to the live capture of animals in complex environments, a limited sea-animal image dataset, and the complex topography of the seafloor, particularly in shallow waters, sediments, reefs, submarine ridges, and ship radiation, the efficacy of identification and classification is still a bottleneck for several researchers. In this paper, three hybrid Classical-Quantum neural networks ResNet50-QCNN, ResNet18-QCNN and InceptionV3-QCNN have been proposed for underwater quantum-classical Animal Identification and Classification. It significantly lessens the complexity of classical computer processing data by using quantum devices to minimize dimension and denoise datasets. The numerical simulation results demonstrate that the quantum algorithm is capable of effective dimensionality reduction and an improvement in classification accuracy. The hybrid approach offers polynomial acceleration in dimension reduction beyond classical techniques, even when quantum data is read out classically. The three hybrid models, viz., ResNet50-QCNN, ResNet18-QCNN, and InceptionV3-QCNN, displayed classification test accuracy of 88%, 80.29%, and 70%, respectively, revealing that ResNet50-QCNN performed best in identifying and classifying underwater animals.

TI Is Wave Function Collapse Necessary? Explaining Quantum Nondemolition
   Measurement of a Spin Qubit within Linear Evolution
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB The measurement problem dates back to the dawn of quantum mechanics. Here, we measure a quantum dot electron spin qubit through off-resonant coupling with a highly redundant ancilla, consisting of thousands of nuclear spins. Large redundancy allows for single-shot measurement with high fidelity approximate to 99.85%. Repeated measurements enable heralded initialization of the qubit and backaction-free detection of electron spin quantum jumps, attributed to burstlike fluctuations in a thermally populated phonon bath. Based on these results we argue that the measurement, linking quantum states to classical observables, can be made without any "wave function collapse" in agreement with the Quantum Darwinism concept.

TI Security proof of practical quantum key distribution with
   detection-efficiency mismatch
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Quantum key distribution (QKD) protocols with threshold detectors are driving high-performance QKD demonstrations. The corresponding security proofs usually assume that all physical detectors have the same detection efficiency. However, the efficiencies of the detectors used in practice might show a mismatch depending on the manufacturing and setup of these detectors. A mismatch can also be induced as the different spatial-temporal modes of an incoming signal might couple differently to a detector. Here we develop a method that allows to provide security proofs without the usual assumption. Our method can take the detection-efficiency mismatch into account without having to restrict the attack strategy of the adversary. Especially, we do not rely on any photon-number cutoff of incoming signals such that our security proof is directly applicable to practical situations. We illustrate our method for a receiver that is designed for polarization encoding and is sensitive to a number of spatial-temporal modes. In our detector model, the absence of quantum interference between any pair of spatial-temporal modes is assumed. For a QKD protocol with this detector model, we can perform a security proof with characterized efficiency mismatch and without photon-number cutoff assumption. Our method also shows that in the absence of efficiency mismatch in our detector model, the key rate increases if the loss due to detection inefficiency is assumed to be outside of the adversary's control, as compared to the view where for a security proof this loss is attributed to the action of the adversary.

TI Waveguide-coupled superconducting nanowire single-photon detectors based
   on femtosecond laser direct writing
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB The implementation of quantum information technologies requires the development of integrated quantum chips. Femtosecond laser direct writing (FLDW) waveguides and superconducting nanowire single-photon detectors (SNSPDs) have been widely applied in integrated quantum photonic circuits. In this work, a novel FLDW waveguide-coupled SNSPD was designed and realized by integrating FLDW waveguides and conventional SNSPDs together. Through a COMSOL simulation, a waveguide end face-nanowire optical coupling structure was designed and verified. The simulation results showed that the FLDW waveguide-coupled SNSPD device, which had a target wavelength of 780 nm, can achieve 87% optical absorption. Then the preparation process of the FLDW waveguide-coupled SNSPD device was developed, and the fabricated device achieved a system detection efficiency of 1.7% at 10 Hz dark count rate. Overall, this method provides a feasible single-photon detector solution for future on-chip integrated quantum photonic experiments and applications.

TI A hybrid quantum-classical conditional generative adversarial network
   algorithm for human-centered paradigm in cloud
SO EURASIP JOURNAL ON WIRELESS COMMUNICATIONS AND NETWORKING
AB As an emerging field that aims to bridge the gap between human activities and computing systems, human-centered computing (HCC) in cloud, edge, fog has had a huge impact on the artificial intelligence algorithms. The quantum generative adversarial network (QGAN) is considered to be one of the quantum machine learning algorithms with great application prospects, which also should be improved to conform to the human-centered paradigm. The generation process of QGAN is relatively random and the generated model does not conform to the human-centered concept, so it is not quite suitable for real scenarios. In order to solve these problems, a hybrid quantum-classical conditional generative adversarial network (QCGAN) algorithm is proposed, which is a knowledge-driven human-computer interaction computing mode that can be implemented in cloud. The purposes of stabilizing the generation process and realizing the interaction between human and computing process are achieved by inputting artificial conditional information in the generator and discriminator. The generator uses the parameterized quantum circuit with an all-to-all connected topology, which facilitates the tuning of network parameters during the training process. The discriminator uses the classical neural network, which effectively avoids the "input bottleneck" of quantum machine learning. Finally, the BAS training set is selected to conduct experiment on the quantum cloud computing platform. The result shows that the QCGAN algorithm can effectively converge to the Nash equilibrium point after training and perform human-centered classification generation tasks.

TI Prisoners' Dilemma in a Spatially Separated System Based on Spin-Photon
   Interactions
SO PHOTONICS
AB Having access to ideal quantum mechanical resources, the prisoners' dilemma can be ceased. Here, we propose a distributed quantum circuit to allow spatially separated prisoners to play the prisoners' dilemma game. Decomposing the circuit into controlled-Z and single-qubit gates only, we design a corresponding spin-photon-interaction-based physical setup within the reach of current technology. In our setup, spins are considered to be the players' logical qubits, which can be realized via nitrogen-vacancy centers in diamond or quantum dots coupled to optical cavities, and the game is played via a flying photon realizing logic operations by interacting with the spatially separated optical cavities to which the spin qubits are coupled. We also analyze the effect of the imperfect realization of two-qubit gates on the game, and discuss the revival of the dilemma and the emergence of new Nash equilibria.

TI Photon-Number-Dependent Hamiltonian Engineering for Cavities
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW APPLIED
AB Cavity resonators are promising resources for quantum technology, while native nonlinear interactions for cavities are typically too weak to provide the level of quantum control required to deliver complex targeted operations. Here we investigate a scheme to engineer a target Hamiltonian for photonic cavities using ancilla qubits. By off resonantly driving dispersively coupled ancilla qubits, we develop an optimized approach to engineering an arbitrary photon-number-dependent Hamiltonian for the cavities while mini-mizing the operation errors. The engineered Hamiltonian admits various applications including canceling unwanted cavity self-Kerr interactions, creating higher-order nonlinearities for quantum simulations, and designing quantum gates resilient to noise. Our scheme can be implemented with coupled microwave cavities and transmon qubits in superconducting circuit systems.

TI Self-testing criteria for preparing-measuring qubit system
SO ACTA PHYSICA SINICA
AB Self-testing is the high-level security verification of a claimed quantum device, confirming the quantum states prepared in the device and the measurements performed based solely on the observed statistics. The statistical correlations can realize the self-testing of the quantum system in the preparing-and-measuring scenario. However, most of previous studies focused on the self-testing of shared entangled states between devices, at present only a few researches are presented and the existing work can only simultaneously self-test the states and measurements when some witness inequalities reach a maximum violation. We focus on four-state preparation and the selected scenarios of two measurements. In this scenario, Armin Tavakoli et al. [Tavakoli A, Kaniewski J, Vertesi T, Rosset D, Brunner N 2018 Phys. Rev. A 98 062307] have put forward a criterion based on the dimensional witness violation inequality which can achieve BB84 particles and corresponding Pauli measurements. However, in addition to the maximum violation of the inequality, any statistics with deviation from the maximum deviation cannot be self-tested. Besides, only the BB84 particle preparation and measurements system can be self-tested with that criterion, resulting in a large number of four-state preparation and two measurement systems that cannot be self-tested. Therefore, in this work, in addition to the maximum violation of that dimension inequality, we directly focus on the full observed statistics and further propose some new criteria for self-testing qubit quantum systems in the preparing-and-measiuring scenarios. And the self testing criteria are proven in an ideal case. We construct a local isometry by using the constructions commonly used in device-independent cases, exchange the target system with the additional system, and realize the self testing of more qubit state sets and measurement sets than BB84 particles. This meets the requirements for practical experiments to realize various tasks by different quantum state sets. In addition, we perform a robust analysis of the proposed criteria and use fidelity to describe the closeness of the state to the ideal state of the auxiliary system. Finally, an improved dimensional-dependent NPA method is used to optimize the lower bound of the robustness, making the new criteria practical under experimental noise. We use the YALIMP software package in MATLAB and the solver SEDUMI to solve this optimization problem. The present research increases the diversity of qubit state preparations and self-testing of measurement system, which is beneficial to the actual self-testing of different non-entangled single quantum systems.

SO PHYSICAL REVIEW D
AB In this study, we explore a relativistic quantum Otto heat engine with a qutrit as the working substance interacting with a quantum scalar field in curved spacetime. Unlike qubits, which extract work by simply expanding or shrinking a single energy gap, qutrits allow multiple energy gaps to be adjusted independently, enabling more versatile work extraction in the quantum Otto cycle. We derive a general positive work condition in terms of the effective temperature that each pair of energy levels perceives. Moreover, we discuss additional subtleties that are absent when using a qubit, such as the generation of coherence terms in the density matrix due to interactions.

TI Infinite-Dimensional Programmable Quantum Processors
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB A universal programmable quantum processor uses "program" quantum states to apply an arbitrary quantum channel to an input state. We generalize the concept of a finite-dimensional programmable quantum processor to infinite dimension assuming an energy constraint on the input and output of the target quantum channels. By proving reductions to and from finite-dimensional processors, we obtain upper and lower bounds on the program dimension required to approximately implement energy-limited quantum channels. In particular, we consider the implementation of Gaussian channels. Due to their practical relevance, we investigate the resource requirements for gauge-covariant Gaussian channels. Additionally, we give upper and lower bounds on the program dimension of a processor implementing all Gaussian unitary channels. These lower bounds rely on a direct information-theoretic argument, based on the generalization from finite to infinite dimension of a certain "replication lemma" for unitaries.

TI Fast high-fidelity geometric gates for singlet-triplet qubits
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Geometric gates that use the global property of the geometric phase is believed to be a powerful tool to realize fault-tolerant quantum computation. However, for singlet-triplet qubits in semiconductor quantum dot, the low Rabi frequency of the microwave control leads to overly long gating time, and thus the constructing geometric gate suffers more from the decoherence effect. Here we investigate the key issue of whether the fast geometric gate can be realized for singlet-triplet qubits without introducing an extra microwave-driven pulse, while maintaining the high-fidelity gate operation at the same time. We surprisingly find that both the single-and two-qubit geometric gates can be implemented via only modulating the time-dependent exchange interaction of the Hamiltonian, which can typically be on the order of similar to GHz, and thus the corresponding gate time is of several nanoseconds. Furthermore, the obtained geometric gates are superior to their counterparts, i.e., the conventional dynamical gates for singlet-triplet qubits, with a relatively high fidelity surpassing 99%. Therefore our scheme is particularly applied to singlet-triplet qubits to obtain fast and high-fidelity geometric gates. Our scheme can also be extended to other systems without a microwave drive.

TI Cost and routing of continuous-variable quantum networks
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB We study continuous-variable graph states with regular and complex network shapes, and we report their cost as a global measure of squeezing and the number of squeezed modes that are necessary to build the network. We provide an analytical formula to compute the experimental resources required to implement the graph states, and we use it to show that the scaling of the squeezing cost with the size of the network strictly depends on its topology. We show that homodyne measurements along parallel paths between two nodes allow one to increase the final entanglement in these nodes, and we use this effect to boost the efficiency of an entanglement routing protocol. The devised routing protocol is particularly efficient in running time for complex sparse networks.

TI A refinement of Reznick's Positivstellensatz with applications to
   quantum information theory
SO QUANTUM
AB In his solution of Hilbert's 17th problem Artin showed that any positive definite polynomial in several variables can be written as the quotient of two sums of squares. Later Reznick showed that the denominator in Artin's result can always be chosen as an N-th power of the squared norm of the variables and gave explicit bounds on N. By using concepts from quantum information theory (such as partial traces, optimal cloning maps, and an identity due to Chiribella) we give simpler proofs and minor improvements of both real and complex versions of this result. Moreover, we discuss constructions of Hilbert identities using Gaussian integrals and we review an elementary method to construct complex spherical designs. Finally, we apply our results to give improved bounds for exponential quantum de Finetti theorems in the real and in the complex setting.

AB The LUXE experiment (LASER Und XFEL Experiment) is a new experiment in planning at DESY Hamburg, which will study Quantum Electrodynamics (QED) at the strongfield frontier. In this regime, QED is non-perturbative. This manifests itself in the creation of physical electron-positron pairs from the QED vacuum. LUXE intends to measure the positron production rate in this unprecedented regime by using, among others, a silicon tracking detector. The large number of expected positrons traversing the sensitive detector layers results in an extremely challenging combinatorial problem, which can become computationally very hard for classical computers. This paper presents a preliminary study to explore the potential of quantum computers to solve this problem and to reconstruct the positron trajectories from the detector energy deposits. The reconstruction problem is formulated in terms of a quadratic unconstrained binary optimisation. Finally, the results from the quantum simulations are discussed and compared with traditional classical track reconstruction algorithms.

TI Pseudorandom Density Matrices
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB Pseudorandom states (PRSs) are state ensembles that cannot be efficiently distinguished from Haarrandom states. However, the definition of PRSs has been limited to pure states and lacks robustness against noise. In this work, we introduce pseudorandom density matrices (PRDMs), ensembles of n-qubit states that are computationally indistinguishable from the generalized Hilbert-Schmidt ensemble (GHSE), which is constructed from (n + m)-qubit Haar random states with m qubits traced out. Form = 0, PRDMs are equivalent to PRSs, whereas for m = co (log n), PRDMs are computationally indistinguishable from the maximally mixed state. PRDMs with m = co (log n) are robust to unital noise channels and separated in terms of security from PRS. PRDMs can disguise valuable quantum resources as trivial states. In particular, we construct pseudoresource state ensembles, which possess near-maximal entanglement, magic and coherence, but are computationally indistinguishable from resource-free states. PRDMs exhibit a pseudoresource gap of O(n) vs 0, surpassing previously found gaps. We also render EFI pairs, a fundamental cryptographic primitive, robust to strong mixed unitary noise. Our work has major implications on quantum resource theory. We show that entanglement, magic, and coherence cannot be efficiently tested, and that black-box resource distillation requires a superpolynomial number of copies. We also establish lower bounds on the purity needed for efficient testing and black-box distillation. Finally, we introduce memoryless PRSs, a noise-robust notion of PRS, which are indistinguishable to Haar random states for efficient algorithms without quantum memory, as well as noise-robust quantum money. Our work provides a comprehensive framework of pseudorandomness for mixed states, which yields powerful quantum cryptographic primitives and fundamental bounds on quantum resource theories.

TI Asymptotic steady state of a dissipative long-range interacting spin
   system at finite temperature
SO PHYSICA SCRIPTA
AB Many of the recently developed quantum systems that are considered promising candidates for the underlying technology of quantum computing enjoy long-range interaction, which is even tunable in some of them. Most of these systems can be described using the Heisenberg spin model to represent their interaction with the same system or a different one in hybrid structures. We consider here a finite two-dimensional spin system with a varying spin-spin long-range interaction under the effect of an external uniform magnetic field. We investigate the dynamics of the system and its asymptotic behavior at different degrees of anisotropy and interaction range under coupling to a thermal dissipative environment, starting from different initial states. We show that the system spin state and bipartite entanglement evolve in time to reach asymptotic values that are enhanced significantly by the degree of anisotropy and interaction range, whereas the thermal dissipative environment degrades the entanglement asymptotic equilibrium value as the temperature increases. Interestingly, while the robustness of the spin system against the environment's thermal dissipative effects increases with the interaction range and degree of anisotropy, the entanglement between the far sites on the lattice shows its highest resilience in the partially anisotropic system, which might be attributed to a critical behavior taking place in the system. While the system's early dynamics varies significantly depending on the initial state, the asymptotic equilibrium value is found to be completely independent.

TI Bell inequality violations with random mutually unbiased bases
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB We examine the problem of exhibiting Bell nonlocality for a two-qudit entangled pure state using a randomly chosen set of mutually unbiased bases (MUBs). Interestingly, even if we employ only two-setting Bell inequalities, we find a significant chance of obtaining a Bell violation if the two parties are individually allowed to measure a sufficient number of MUBs. In particular, for the case of maximally entangled qutrits and ququarts, our numerical estimates indicate that we can obtain near-guaranteed Bell violation by considering only such Bell inequalities. The case of maximally entangled ququints is similar, albeit the chance of ending up with a successful trial decreases somewhat to approximately 99.84%. Upon a closer inspection, we find that even all these no-violation instances violate some more-setting Bell inequalities. These results suggest that the experimental tests of Bell nonlocality for these higher-dimensional entangled states remain viable even if the two parties do not share a common reference frame.

TI Passive Photonic CZ Gate with Two-Level Emitters in Chiral Multimode
   Waveguide QED
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB Engineering deterministic photonic gates with simple resources is one of the long-standing challenges in photonic quantum computing. Here, we design a passive conditional gate between copropagating photons using an array of only two-level emitters. The key resource is to harness the effective photon-photon interaction induced by the chiral coupling of the emitter array to two waveguide modes with different resonant momenta at the emitter's transition frequency. By studying the system's multiphoton scattering response, we demonstrate that, in certain limits, this configuration induces a nonlinear yr-phase shift between the polariton eigenstates of the system without distorting spectrally the wave packets. Then, we show how to harness this nonlinear phase shift to engineer a conditional, deterministic photonic gate in different qubit encodings, with a fidelity arbitrarily close to 1 in the limit of large number of emitters and coupling efficiency. Our configuration can be implemented in topological photonic setups with multiple chiral-edge modes, opening their use for quantum information processing, or in other setups where such chiral light-matter couplings can be effectively obtained, such as optical fibers or photonic-crystal optical and microwave waveguides.

TI An algorithm to factorize quantum walks into shift and coin operations
SO LETTERS IN MATHEMATICAL PHYSICS
AB We provide an algorithm that factorizes one-dimensional quantum walks on an arbitrary but fixed cell structure into a protocol of two basic operations: a fixed conditional shift that transports particles between cells and suitable coin operators that act locally in each cell. This allows to tailor quantum walk protocols to any experimental set-up by rephrasing it on the cell structure determined by the experimental limitations. We give the example of a walk defined on a qutrit chain compiled to run on a qubit chain.

TI Observation of quantum entanglement in top quark pair production in
   proton-proton collisions at √s=13 TeV
SO REPORTS ON PROGRESS IN PHYSICS
AB Entanglement is an intrinsic property of quantum mechanics and is predicted to be exhibited in the particles produced at the Large Hadron Collider. A measurement of the extent of entanglement in top quark-antiquark (t (t) over bar) events produced in proton-proton collisions at a center-of-mass energy of 13 TeV is performed with the data recorded by the CMS experiment at the CERN LHC in 2016, and corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 36.3 fb(-1). The events are selected based on the presence of two leptons with opposite charges and high transverse momentum. An entanglement-sensitive observable D is derived from the top quark spin-dependent parts of the t (t) over bar production density matrix and measured in the region of the t (t) over bar production threshold. Values of D < -1/3 are evidence of entanglement and D is observed (expected) to be -0.480(-0.029)(+0.026) (-0.467(-0.029)(+0.026)) at the parton level. With an observed significance of 5.1 standard deviations with respect to the non-entangled hypothesis, this provides observation of quantum mechanical entanglement within t (t) over bar pairs in this phase space. This measurement provides a new probe of quantum mechanics at the highest energies ever produced.

TI Schrodinger's Ballot: Quantum Information and the Violation of Arrow's
   Impossibility Theorem
SO ENTROPY
AB We study Arrow's Impossibility Theorem in the quantum setting. Our work is based on the work of Bao and Halpern, in which it is proved that the quantum analogue of Arrow's Impossibility Theorem is not valid. However, we feel unsatisfied about the proof presented in Bao and Halpern's work. Moreover, the definition of Quantum Independence of Irrelevant Alternatives (QIIA) in Bao and Halpern's work seems not appropriate to us. We give a better definition of QIIA, which properly captures the idea of the independence of irrelevant alternatives, and a detailed proof of the violation of Arrow's Impossibility Theorem in the quantum setting with the modified definition.

TI Security Analysis of Continuous-Variable Measurement-Device-Independent
   Quantum Key Distribution Systems in Complex Communication Environments
SO ENTROPY
AB Continuous-variable measure-device-independent quantum key distribution (CV-MDI QKD) is proposed to remove all imperfections originating from detection. However, there are still some inevitable imperfections in a practical CV-MDI QKD system. For example, there is a fluctuating channel transmittance in the complex communication environments. Here we investigate the security of the system under the effects of the fluctuating channel transmittance, where the transmittance is regarded as a fixed value related to communication distance in theory. We first discuss the parameter estimation in fluctuating channel transmittance based on these establishing of channel models, which has an obvious deviation compared with the estimated parameters in the ideal case. Then, we show the evaluated results when the channel transmittance respectively obeys the two-point distribution and the uniform distribution. In particular, the two distributions can be easily realized under the manipulation of eavesdroppers. Finally, we analyze the secret key rate of the system when the channel transmittance obeys the above distributions. The simulation analysis indicates that a slight fluctuation of the channel transmittance may seriously reduce the performance of the system, especially in the extreme asymmetric case. Furthermore, the communication between Alice, Bob and Charlie may be immediately interrupted. Therefore, eavesdroppers can manipulate the channel transmittance to complete a denial-of-service attack in a practical CV-MDI QKD system. To resist this attack, the Gaussian post-selection method can be exploited to calibrate the parameter estimation to reduce the deterioration of performance of the system.

TI A Hybrid Quantum-Classical Architecture with Data Re-Uploading and
   Genetic Algorithm Optimization for Enhanced Image Classification
SO COMPUTATION
AB Quantum machine learning (QML) has emerged as a promising approach for enhancing image classification by exploiting quantum computational principles such as superposition and entanglement. However, practical applications on complex datasets like CIFAR-100 remain limited due to the low expressivity of shallow circuits and challenges in circuit optimization. In this study, we propose HQCNN-REGA-a novel hybrid quantum-classical convolutional neural network architecture that integrates data re-uploading and genetic algorithm optimization for improved performance. The data re-uploading mechanism allows classical inputs to be encoded multiple times into quantum states, enhancing the model's capacity to learn complex visual features. In parallel, a genetic algorithm is employed to evolve the quantum circuit architecture by optimizing gate sequences, entanglement patterns, and layer configurations. This combination enables automatic discovery of efficient parameterized quantum circuits without manual tuning. Experiments on the MNIST and CIFAR-100 datasets demonstrate state-of-the-art performance for quantum models, with HQCNN-REGA outperforming existing quantum neural networks and approaching the accuracy of advanced classical architectures. In particular, we compare our model with classical convolutional baselines such as ResNet-18 to validate its effectiveness in real-world image classification tasks. Our results demonstrate the feasibility of scalable, high-performing quantum-classical systems and offer a viable path toward practical deployment of QML in computer vision applications, especially on noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) hardware.

TI The photonic content of a transmission-line pulse
SO PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF
   AMERICA
AB We develop a photonic description of short, one-dimensional electromagnetic pulses, specifically in the language of electrical transmission lines. Current practice in quantum technology, using arbitrary waveform generators, can readily produce very short, fewcycle pulses in a very -low -noise, low -temperature setting. We argue that these systems attain the limit of producing pure coherent quantum states, in which the vacuum has been displaced for a short time, and therefore over a short spatial extent. When the pulse is bipolar, that is, the integrated voltage of the pulse is zero, then the state can be described by the finite displacement of a single mode. Therefore there is a definite mean number of photons, but which have neither a well-defined frequency nor position. Due to the Paley-Wiener theorem, the two -component photon "wavefunction" of this mode, while somewhat localized, is not strictly bounded in space even if the vacuum displacement that defines it is bounded. When the pulse is unipolar, no photonic description is possible-the photon number can be considered to be divergent. We consider properties that photon counters and quantum non -demolition detectors must have to optimally convert and detect the photons in several example pulses. We develop a conceptual test system for implementing short -pulse quantum key distribution, building on the design of a recently achieved Bell's theorem test in a cryogenic microwave setup.

TI Spatial-mode diversity and multiplexing for continuous variables quantum
   communications
SO COMMUNICATIONS PHYSICS
AB Quantum communication is a key enabler of future secure networks, but its performance is often limited by noise, channel fading, and interference. Current systems struggle to maintain high fidelity and key rates under realistic, dynamic channel conditions. Here, we show that continuous-variable quantum communication systems can benefit significantly from spatial-mode diversity combined with tailored amplification strategies, depending on the available knowledge of the channel. We model the effects of fading as a log-normal distribution and evaluate different amplification approaches at the transmitter and receiver. Our results demonstrate improved fidelity and robustness against noise and fading, especially in harsh environments. We also find that, in certain conditions, spatial-mode diversity provides higher secret key rates than conventional multiplexing strategies in continuous-variable quantum key distribution. These findings highlight the potential of diversity techniques to enhance the stability and scalability of quantum communication networks in practical deployments.

TI Quantum Sensing of Free Radicals in Primary Human Dendritic Cells
SO NANO LETTERS
AB Free radicals are crucial indicators for stress and appear in all kinds of pathogenic conditions, including cancer, cardiovascular diseases, and infection. However, they are difficult to detect due to their reactivity and low abundance. We use relaxometry for the detection of radicals with subcellular resolution. This method is based on a fluorescent defect in a diamond, which changes its optical properties on the basis of the magnetic surroundings. This technique allows nanoscale MRI with unprecedented sensitivity and spatial resolution. Recently, this technique was used inside living cells from a cell line. Cell lines differ in terms of endocytic capability and radical production from primary cells derived from patients. Here we provide the first measurements of phagocytic radical production by the NADPH oxidase (NOX2) in primary dendritic cells from healthy donors. The radical production of these cells differs greatly between donors. We investigated the cell response to stimulation or inhibition.

TI Discriminating mixed qubit states with collective measurements
SO COMMUNICATIONS PHYSICS
AB It is a central fact in quantum mechanics that non-orthogonal states cannot be distinguished perfectly. In general, the optimal measurement for distinguishing such states is a collective measurement. However, to the best our knowledge, collective measurements have not been used to enhance quantum state discrimination to date. One of the main reasons for this is the fact that, in the usual state discrimination setting with equal prior probabilities, at least three copies of a quantum state are required to be measured collectively to outperform separable measurements. This is very challenging experimentally. In this work, by considering unequal prior probabilities, we propose and experimentally demonstrate a protocol for distinguishing two copies of single qubit states using collective measurements which achieves a lower probability of error than can be achieved by any non-entangling measurement. Additionally, we implemented collective measurements on three and four copies of the unknown state and found they performed poorly.
   Non-orthogonal quantum states cannot be perfectly distinguished - a fact of central importance in quantum mechanics, from both a fundamental and practical viewpoint. The authors introduce an approach to this problem, using entangled measurements to distinguish quantum states better than what is possible with direct measurements.

TI Reassessing the computational advantage of quantum-controlled ordering
   of gates
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Research on indefinite causal structures is a rapidly evolving field that has a potential not only to make a radical revision of the classical understanding of space-time but also to achieve enhanced functionalities of quantum information processing. For example, it is known that indefinite causal structures provide exponential advantage in communication complexity when compared to causal protocols. In quantum computation, such structures can decide whether two unitary gates commute or anticommute with a single call to each gate, which is impossible with conventional (causal) quantum algorithms. A generalization of this effect to n unitary gates, originally introduced in Araujo et al. [Phys. Lett. 113, 250402 (2014)] and often called Fourier promise problem (FPP), can be solved with the quantum-n-switch and a single call to each gate, while the best known causal algorithm so far calls O(n(2)) gates. In this article, we show that this advantage is smaller than expected. In fact, we present a causal algorithm that solves the only known specific FPP with O(n log (n)) queries and a causal algorithm that solves every FPP with O(n/root n) queries. Besides the interest in such algorithms on their own, our results limit the expected advantage of indefinite causal structures for these problems.

   FOR CONSTRAINED STRUCTURAL OPTIMIZATION
SO JOURNAL OF INDUSTRIAL AND MANAGEMENT OPTIMIZATION
AB To enhance the optimization ability of the satin bowerbird optimization (SBO) algorithm, in this paper, a novel quantum-inspired SBO with Bloch spherical search is proposed. In this algorithm, satin bowerbirds are encoded using qubits described on the Bloch sphere, each satin bowerbird occupies three locations in the search space and each location represents an optimization solution. Using the search method of general SBO to adjust the two parameters of the qubit, qubit rotation is performed on the Bloch sphere, which simultaneously updates the three locations occupied by a qubit and quickly approaches the global optimal solution. Finally, the experimental results of five examples of structural engineering design show that the proposed algorithm is superior to other state-of-the-art metaheuristic algorithms in terms of the performance measures.

TI E-Payment Protocols Based on Quantum Walk
SO ACTA OPTICA SINICA
AB Objective In recent years, with the rapid development of e-commerce and computer, online shopping is more and more popular. In the meantime, the development of quantum algorithms makes the traditional e-payment protocols based on difficult mathematical problems more and more insecure, so the e-payment protocols based on quantum algorithms come into being. At present, most of the proposed quantum e-payment protocols use entangled states for quantum electronic signature protocols. However, the preparation and measurement of entangled states are very difficult, so in the case of ensuring the security of the protocols, using quantum states featuring more convenient preparation and measurement, instead of entangled states, has become a research direction of e-payment. Quantum walk is a technology that can produce the necessary entanglement resources spontaneously only by using the single-particle states without preparing entanglement resources in advance. This technology has been widely used in quantum computing and quantum simulation and is of certain practical value. At the same time, as people pay more attention to personal privacy, only users' shopping lists being confidential to banks have been unable to meet people's privacy needs. Therefore, in order to solve the above problems, we modify a classic e-payment agreement model and make the hidden users' identity information not affect the normal delivery and merchants. Furthermore, we combine the quantum walk with quantum e-payment and propose a quantum e-payment protocol to ensure that entanglement resources can be obtained without preparing entangled states in advance and guarantee that the buyers' bank accounts and real identity information can be kept confidential to merchants.
   Methods Quantum walk is an extension of random walk in the quantum field. It takes the quantum as the carrier to simulate the chaotic nonlinear dynamic walk behavior. According to the characteristics of the quantum walk, the encrypted quantum communication channels are established accordingly. The quantum walk mainly contains the complex Hilbert space of two main quantum spaces, namely, coin space and position space. The protocol is based on the one-dimensional quantum walk teleportation, and through the two-step quantum walk, the shift operator can make the position space and coin space entangle with each other, so as to construct quantum channels for information transmission. The biggest advantage of quantum walk technology is that it can obtain the entanglement resources through the single photon operation. The measurement and preparation of the protocol are simpler compared with directly operating entangled states, and the randomness of the quantum walk makes the transmission more secure. In addition, by dividing the shopping information of buyers into the identity information accessible to the banks and making the shopping list open to the merchants, the banks and the merchants in the protocol will not know the information obtained by the other party so that the privacy of the buyers is greatly protected.
   Results and Discussions Firstly, in order to further protect the users' privacy, we modify a classic electronic payment agreement model (Fig. 1). In this model, we reduce the workload of buyers and give the processing and distribution of information to third-party platforms. While keeping the buyers' shopping lists confidential to the banks, the buyers' identity information is also unavailable to the merchants. So this protocol makes the merchants and the banks only have the information that they need and know nothing of the information obtained by the other party. Secondly, quantum walk technology is applied to various stages of the protocol including the trading purchase phase, trading payment phase, and verifying phase (Fig. 2). By applying quantum walk technology, the complexity of quantum resource preparation and measurement in the protocol is reduced. Finally, the security analysis of this protocol is conducted (Fig. 3), and the result shows that neither the internal nor external attackers of this protocol can obtain the secret information in the protocol, and this protocol can resist both internal and external attacks.
   Conclusions This protocol, compared with the existing quantum e-payment protocols, not only retains the third-party platforms and the inter-bank payment function but also combines the quantum walk and electronic payment. It makes the participants of the protocol in the initial stage free from preparing particles in entangled states and makes them only prepare the single-particle states which can get the required entanglement resources. This move reduces the complexity of quantum state preparation and measurement. At the same time, the shopping information of the buyers is divided, with the information of the purchased goods confidential to the banks and the buyers' private information unavailable to the merchants. In addition, when the merchants really need this part of the information of the buyers, they can apply to third-party platforms for the information. Being reviewed by the platforms and approved by the buyers, the merchants can know the information they want, so as to complete the corresponding operation. Finally, security analysis shows that this protocol can resist internal and external attacks and is safe and feasible under current technology.

TI Thermonuclear Fusion Based Quantum-Inspired Algorithm for Solving
   Multiobjective Optimization Problems
SO ALGORITHMS
AB This paper introduces a novel quantum-inspired algorithm for numerical multiobjective optimization, uniquely integrating the multilevel structure of qudits with principles of controlled thermonuclear fusion. Moving beyond conventional qubit-based approaches, the algorithm leverages the qudit's higher-dimensional state space to enhance search capabilities. Fusion-inspired dynamics-modeling particle interaction, energy release, and plasma cooling-provide a powerful metaheuristic framework for navigating complex, high-dimensional Pareto fronts. A hybrid quantum-classical version of the algorithm is presented, designed to exploit the complementary strengths of both computational paradigms for improved efficiency in solving dynamic multiobjective problems. Experimental evaluation on standard dynamic multiobjective benchmarks demonstrates clear performance advantages. Both the quantum-inspired and hybrid variants consistently outperform leading classical algorithms such as NSGA-III, MOEA/D and GDE3, as well as the quantum-inspired NSGA-III, in key metrics: identifying a greater number of unique non-dominated solutions, ensuring superior uniformity along the Pareto front, maintaining stable convergence across generations, and achieving higher accuracy in approximating the ideal solution.

TI Quantum Key Distribution Network and Quantum Secure Cloud Technologies
   for Genome Medicine Use Cases
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON QUANTUM ENGINEERING
AB Quantum key distribution (QKD) is a technology for distributing cryptographic keys between two communication parties based on the quantum physics for the secure communication. A trusted node-based key relay technique is integrated with QKD to overcome the technical limitations of QKD and to enable key distribution between two arbitrary communication parties in the trusted node network, which we refer to as the QKD network. In addition, secret-sharing technology has been integrated with the QKD network to realize secure data storage and secure data communication, which we call a quantum secure cloud. This article presents the development and evaluation of the proof-of-concept (PoC) system for the QKD network and a quantum secure cloud, especially applied to the genome medicine domain. The PoC system was developed at Tohoku University and Toshiba sites to address the "cancer clinical sequencing" use case. We evaluated three practical scenarios with the PoC system: 1) real-time transmission of genome analysis data; 2) "expert panel," an online video conference for medical experts' discussion; and 3) distributed backup of genome analysis data. To support these scenarios, we developed three new functions: 1) a function for monitoring output data and pipeline processing of data encryption/decryption and transmission for secure large-scale data transfer; 2) a key management system function to achieve both large-scale data transmission and low-latency data communication; and 3) a function for preemptive key data reading and direct access to storage devices to enable high-speed data transmission and distributed data backup using a secret-sharing scheme. These scenarios and functions were evaluated and demonstrated using real or simulated genome data. The evaluation results reveal that QKD network and quantum secure cloud technologies can be applied to cancer clinical sequencing as a use case of the genome medicine domain.

TI Quantum imaginary-time evolution algorithm for quantum field theories
   with continuous variables
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB We calculate the energy levels and corresponding eigenstates of an interacting scalar quantum field theory on a lattice using a continuous-variable version of the quantum imaginary-time evolution algorithm. Only a single qumode is needed for the simulation of the field at each point on the lattice. Our quantum algorithm avoids the use of non-Gaussian quantum gates and relies, instead, on detectors projecting onto eigenstates of the photon-number operator. Using Xanadu's Strawberry Fields photonic simulator, we obtain results on energy levels that are in very good agreement with results from exact calculations. We propose an experimental setup that can be realized with existing technology.

TI On the hybrid Davies like generator for quantum dissipation
SO CHAOS
AB We provide a class of quantum evolution beyond Markovian semigroup. This class is governed by a hybrid Davies like generator such that dissipation is controlled by a suitable memory kernel and decoherence by standard Gorini-Kossakowski-Lindblad-Sudarshan generator. These two processes commute and both of them commute with the unitary evolution controlled by the systems Hamiltonian. The corresponding memory kernel gives rise to semi-Markov evolution of the diagonal elements of the density matrix. However, the corresponding evolution needs not be completely positive. The role of decoherence generator is to restore complete positivity. Hence, to pose the dynamical problem, one needs two processes generated by classical semi-Markov memory kernel and purely quantum decoherence generator. This scheme is illustrated for a qubit evolution. Published under license by AIP Publishing.

AB Hyperparameter Optimization (HPO) of Deep Learning (DL)-based models tends to be a compute resource intensive process as it usually requires to train the target model with many different hyperparameter configurations. We show that integrating model performance prediction with early stopping methods holds great potential to speed up the HPO process of deep learning models. Moreover, we propose a novel algorithm called Swift-Hyperband that can use either classical or quantum Support Vector Regression (SVR) for performance prediction and benefit from distributed High Performance Computing (HPC) environments. This algorithm is tested not only for the Machine-Learned Particle Flow (MLPF), model used in High-Energy Physics (HEP), but also for a wider range of target models from domains such as computer vision and natural language processing. Swift-Hyperband is shown to find comparable (or better) hyperparameters as well as using less computational resources in all test cases.

TI Detection of Single W-Centers in Silicon
SO ACS PHOTONICS
AB ABSTRACT: Controlling the quantum properties of individual fluorescent defects in silicon is a key challenge toward large-scale advanced quantum photonic devices. Research efforts have so far focused on extrinsic defects based on impurities incorporated inside the silicon lattice. Here, we demonstrate the detection of single intrinsic defects in silicon, which are linked to a tri-interstitial complex called the W-center, with a zero-phonon line at 1.218 mu m. Investigating their single-photon emission properties reveals new information about this common radiation damage center, such as its dipolar orientation and its photophysics. We also identify its microscopic structure and show that, although this defect does not feature electronic states in the bandgap, Coulomb interactions lead to excitonic radiative recombination below the silicon bandgap. These results could set the stage for numerous quantum perspectives based on intrinsic luminescent defects in silicon, such as integrated quantum photonics and quantum communications.

TI Selective Temperature Sensing in Nanodiamonds Using Dressed States
SO ADVANCED QUANTUM TECHNOLOGIES
AB Temperature sensing at the nanoscale is a significant experimental challenge. Here, an approach using dressed states is reported to make a leading quantum sensor - the nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center in diamond - selectively sensitive to temperature, even in the presence of normally confounding magnetic fields. Using an experimentally straightforward approach, the magnetic sensitivity of the NV center is suppressed by a factor of seven, while retaining full temperature sensitivity and narrowing the NV center linewidth. These results demonstrate the power of engineering the sensor Hamiltonian using external control fields to enable sensing with improved specificity to target signals.
   Engineering new quantum states using tailored drives enables a quantum sensor to selectively detect temperature changes, even in the presence of magnetic field changes which would normally dominate the response. image

TI The presence of Responsible Research and Innovation in the perspectives
   of Dutch policy officers regarding innovation with quantum technology
SO JOURNAL OF RESPONSIBLE TECHNOLOGY
AB The European Union strives to align research and innovation to the values, needs and expectations of society to address societal challenges. To support this alignment the European Union endeavours to make Responsible Research and Innovation (RRI) part of the governmental policies on science and technology of its member states. If the European Union is effective in this endeavour, then principles that are common in the field of RRI should play a significant role in the perspectives that belong to the member states' policy officers for research and innovation. In this paper we empirically check this by conducting a Q-method study on Dutch policy officers working on quantum technology-related policies. In this study we found four perspectives on innovation among these policy officers. In all these perspectives some of the RRI principles are present in merely a weak manner, or even absent, casting substantial doubts on whether RRI has become part of the EU member state governmental policies on science and technology.

TI Thermodynamic uncertainty relation of a quantum mechanically coupled
   two-qubit system
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB The minimal bound of the thermodynamic uncertainty relation (TUR) is modulated from that of the classical counterpart (Qmin = 2) when a quantumness is present in the dynamical process far from equilibrium. A recent study on a dissipative two-level system (TLS) subject to an external field indicates that quantum coherence can suppress the fluctuations of the irreversible current and loosens the TUR bound to QTLS extending the field-driven single TLS to a quantum mechanically coupled two-qubit system (TQS), we explore how the quantum coupling between the two qubits, an additional complexity introduced to the probem of TLS, affects the photon current, fluctuations, and the TUR bound. We find that the TUR bound of the TQS depends on the strength of coupling, such that QTQSmin = QTLS min approximate to 1.25 when the two qubits are effectively decoupled under weak coupling, whereas another loose bound QTQS min 1.36 is identified for two strongly coupled qubits under strong fields. By contrasting the TQS against two coupled noisy oscillators, we illuminate the quantumness unique to the TQS and its effect on the TUR. Our findings from the study of the TQS form the basis for understanding the TUR of more general N-qubit systems.

TI Full-mode characterization of correlated photon pairs generated in
   spontaneous downconversion
SO OPTICS LETTERS
AB Spontaneous parametric downconversion is the primary source to generate entangled photon pairs in quantum photonics laboratories. Depending on the experimental design, the generated photon pairs can be correlated in the frequency spectrum, polarization, position-momentum, and spatial modes. Exploring the spatial modes' correlation has hitherto been limited to the polar coordinates' azimuthal angle, and a few attempts to study Walsh mode's radial states. Here, we study the full-mode correlation, on a Laguerre-Gauss basis, between photon pairs generated in a type-I crystal. Furthermore, we explore the effect of a structured pump beam possessing different spatial modes onto bi-photon spatial correlation. Finally, we use the capability to project over arbitrary spatial mode superpositions to perform the bi-photon state's full quantum tomography in a 16-dimensional subspace.

Certification protocols of entanglement and steering, suitable for continuous-variable non-Gaussian states are scarce and generally highly demanding from an experimental point of view. We propose a protocol based on Fisher information for witnessing steering in general continuous-variable bipartite states, through homo-dyne detection. It proves to be relevant for the detection of non-Gaussian steering in scenarios where witnesses based on Gaussian features like the covariance matrix are shown to fail.

AB In high-energy particle collisions, charged track finding is a complex yet crucial endeavor. We propose a quantum algorithm, specifically quantum template matching, to enhance the accuracy and efficiency of track finding. Abstracting the Quantum Amplitude Amplification routine by introducing a data register, and utilizing a novel oracle construction, allows data to be parsed to the circuit and matched with a hit-pattern template, without prior knowledge of the input data. Furthermore, we address the challenges posed by missing hit data, demonstrating the ability of the quantum template matching algorithm to successfully identify charged-particle tracks from hit patterns with missing hits. Our findings therefore propose quantum methodologies tailored for real-world applications and underline the potential of quantum computing in collider physics.

TI Controlling many-body synchronous revival dynamics and entanglement
   cycle of ultracold atoms with synthetic gauge fields
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB The exploration of tunneling dynamics in many-body quantum systems plays a pivotal role in realizing groundbreaking atomtronic devices and achieving precise control over entanglement. Here, we delve into the intricate many-body tunneling dynamics of ultracold atoms confined within a quadruple-well potential, with a particular emphasis on the manipulative role played by interatomic interactions and synthetic gauge fields. The quantum dynamics displayed by the system closely mimic the operations of qudit hybrid gates, which are comprised of two relatively independent sets of qudits. In the Rabi regime, which is characterized by strong coupling, we observe an intriguing phenomenon: the cyclic collapse and revival of discrete tunneling dynamics within two distinct qudits. Notably, this intricate dynamical behavior exhibits remarkable synchronous and anti-synchronous revival features, offering a unique opportunity to engineer many-body synchronization pulse signals. In the resonant tunneling regime, distinguished by strong interatomic interactions, we made a remarkable observation: the hybrid qudits undergo a dimensionality reduction, effectively transforming into a qudit. This dimensionality reduction is accompanied by an intriguing phenomenon: the periodicity of its dynamics is intimately intertwined with the occurrence of the entanglement cycle. Remarkably, synthetic gauge fields emerge as potent regulators of this entanglement cycle. Our results uncover the profound implications of synthetic gauge fields on quantum tunneling processes within many-body systems, which hold promising potential applications for engineering atomtronic devices and controlling quantum entanglement.

TI Information retrieval from Hawking radiation in the non-isometric model
   of black hole interior: Theory and quantum simulation
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW D
AB The nonisometric holographic model of the black hole interior stands out as a potential resolution of the long-standing black hole information puzzle since it remedies the friction between the effective calculation and the microscopic description. In this study, combining the final -state projection model, the nonisometric model of black hole interior, and Hayden-Preskill thought experiment, we investigate the information recovery from decoding Hawking radiation and demonstrate the emergence of the Page time in this setup. We incorporate the effective modes into the scrambling inside the horizon, which are usually disregarded in Hayden-Preskill protocols, and show that the Page time can be identified as the transition of information transmission channels from the EPR projection to the local projections. This offers a new perspective on the Page time. We compute the decoupling condition under which retrieving information is feasible and show that this model computes the black hole entropy consistent with the quantum extremal surface calculation. Assuming the full knowledge of the dynamics of the black hole interior, we show how Yoshida-Kitaev decoding strategy can be employed in the modified Hayden-Preskill protocol. Furthermore, we perform experimental tests of both probabilistic and Grover's search decoding strategies on the seven-qubit IBM quantum processors to validate our analytical findings and confirm the feasibility of retrieving information in the nonisometric model. This study would stimulate more interest to explore black hole information problem on the quantum processors.

AB Cavity magnonics deals with the interaction of magnons - elementary excitations in magnetic materials - and confined electromagnetic fields. We introduce the basic physics and review the experimental and theoretical progress of this young field that is gearing up for integration in future quantum technologies. Much of its appeal is derived from the strong magnon-photon coupling and the easily-reached nonlinear regime in microwave cavities. The interaction of magnons with light as detected by Brillouin light scattering is enhanced in magnetic optical resonators, which can be employed to cool and heat magnons. The microwave cavity photon-mediated coupling of a magnon mode to a superconducting qubit enables measurements in the single magnon limit.(c) 2022 Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB Europe has to face strong competitive challenges in the field of QIT from other regions of the world. The tools for the effective implementation of the challenges related to the start, we hope, of building a quantum civilization are both common and individual in particular European countries. Joint projects in the field of QIT, usually narrowly focused, are announced by large European Agencies and are related to their activities. Large-scale collaborative projects are of course the domain of the EC. National projects depend heavily on the capabilities of individual countries and vary greatly in size. The most technologically advanced European countries invest hundreds of millions of Euros in national QIT projects annually. The largest European FET class project currently being implemented is the Quantum Flagship. Although the EQF is basically just one of the elements of a large and complicated European scene of development of quantum technologies, it becomes the most important element and, in a sense, a dominant one, also supported from the political level. There are complex connections and feedbacks between the elements of this quantum scene. National projects try to link to the EQF. Here we are interested in such connections and their impact on the effectiveness of QIT development in Europe, and especially in Poland.

TI On the origin of the controversial electrostatic field effect in
   superconductors
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Superconducting quantum devices offer numerous applications, from electrical metrology and magnetic sensing to energy-efficient high-end computing and advanced quantum information processing. The key elements of quantum circuits are (single and double) Josephson junctions controllable either by electric current or magnetic field. The voltage control, commonly used in semiconductor-based devices via the electrostatic field effect, would be far more versatile and practical. Hence, the field effect recently reported in superconducting devices may revolutionise the whole field of superconductor electronics provided it is confirmed. Here we show that the suppression of the critical current attributed to the field effect, can be explained by quasiparticle excitations in the constriction of superconducting devices. Our results demonstrate that a miniscule leakage current between the gate and the constriction of devices perfectly follows the Fowler-Nordheim model of electron field emission from a metal electrode and injects quasiparticles with energies sufficient to weaken or even suppress superconductivity. A recent report on electrostatic field effect in superconducting devices provides a high potential for advanced quantum technology, but it remains controversial. Here, the authors report that the suppression of critical current, which was attributed to the field effect, can instead be explained by quasiparticle excitations in the constriction of superconducting devices.

TI Generating long-distance magnetic couplings with flat bands
SO SCIPOST PHYSICS
AB One of the great challenges for the large-scale development of quantum technologies is to generate and control the entanglement of quantum bits through interactions of sufficiently long range. Two decades ago, spin chains have been proposed for quantum communication. Unfortunately, couplings are of very short range in general which drastically limits the communication to very short distances. Here, we demonstrate that the presence of flat bands (FBs) can trigger very long-distance magnetic couplings in spin chains. Furthermore, we show that the typical decaying lengthscale is directly related to the quantum metric of the flat band eigenstates. We have validated the robustness of our results in the case where flat bands become weakly dispersive. We believe that our unexpected findings could open up an alternative route to enable long-distance quantum communication.

TI Demonstration of a High-Fidelity CNOT Gate for Fixed-Frequency Transmons
   with Engineered ZZ Suppression
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB Improving two-qubit gate performance and suppressing cross talk are major, but often competing, challenges to achieving scalable quantum computation. In particular, increasing the coupling to realize faster gates has been intrinsically linked to enhanced cross talk due to unwanted two-qubit terms in the Hamiltonian. Here, we demonstrate a novel coupling architecture for transmon qubits that circumvents the standard relationship between desired and undesired interaction rates. Using two fixed frequency coupling elements to tune the dressed level spacings, we demonstrate an intrinsic suppression of the static ZZ while maintaining large effective coupling rates. Our architecture reveals no observable degradation of qubit coherence (T-1, T-2 > 100 mu s) and, over a factor of 6 improvement in the ratio of desired to undesired coupling. Using the cross-resonance interaction, we demonstrate a 180 ns single-pulse controlled NOT (CNOT) gate, and measure a CNOT fidelity of 99.77(2)% from interleaved randomized benchmarking.

TI Assessing the Needs of the Quantum Industry
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON EDUCATION
AB Background: Quantum information science and technology (QIST) has progressed significantly in the last decade, such that it is no longer solely in the domain of research labs, but is now beginning to be developed for, and applied in, industrial applications and products. With the emergence of this new quantum industry, a new workforce trained in QIST skills and knowledge is needed. Research Questions: To help support the education and training of this workforce, universities and colleges require knowledge of the type of jobs available for their students and what skills and degrees are most relevant for those new jobs. What are these jobs, skills, and degrees? Methodology: We report on the results from a survey of 57 companies in the quantum industry, with the goal of elucidating the jobs, skills, and degrees that are relevant for this new workforce. Findings: We find a range of job opportunities from highly specific jobs, such as quantum algorithm developer and error correction scientist, to broader jobs categories within the business, software, and hardware sectors. These broader jobs require a range of skills, most of which are not quantum related. Furthermore, except for the highly specific jobs, companies that responded to the survey are looking for a range of degree levels to fill these new positions, from bachelors to masters to Ph.D.s. Contribution: With this knowledge, students, instructors, and university administrators can make informed decisions about how to address the challenge of increasing the future quantum workforce.

TI Classification of Three-Qubit Genuine Entangled States Using Concurrence
   Fill
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF THEORETICAL PHYSICS
AB Despite the successful experimental generation and verification of genuine multipartite entanglement, several existing entanglement measures remain insufficient to reliably capture its presence. In this study, we overcome this challenge by utilizing a geometric measure known as concurrence fill, which quantifies genuine multipartite entanglement of pure states using the area associated with the underlying concurrence triangle. Firstly, the concurrence fill for three-qubit pure states is reformulated using three tangle and partial tangles. This yields a representation that is more tractable and operational. Using this formulation, we derive a criterion to classify GHZ and W class of states. Next, we analyse the rank-2 mixture of generalized GHZ and W class of states for which three-tangle is known to vanish over a zero polytope. Furthermore, we derive the concurrence fill for the eigenstates of the corresponding mixture and obtain its upper bound for mixed states with zero tangle.

TI Exposing gravitational waves below the quantum sensing limit
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW D
AB The sensitivities of ground-based gravitational-wave (GW) detectors are limited by quantum shot noise at a few hundred hertz and above. Nonetheless, one can use a quantum-correlation technique proposed by Martynov et al. [Phys. Rev. A 95, 043831 (2017) to remove the expectation value of the shot noise, thereby exposing underlying classical signals in the cross spectrum formed by cross-correlating the two outputs in a GWinterferometer's antisymmetric port. We explore here the prospects and analyze the sensitivity of using quantum correlation to detect astrophysical GW signals. Conceptually, this technique is similar to the correlation of two different GW detectors as it utilizes the fact that a GWsignal will be correlated in the two outputs but the shot noise will be uncorrelated. Quantum correlation also has its unique advantages as it requires only a single interferometer to make a detection. Therefore, quantum correlation could increase the duty cycle, enhance the search efficiency, and enable the detection of highly polarized signals. In particular, we show that quantum correlation could be especially useful for detecting postmerger remnants of binary neutron stars with both short (< 1 s) and intermediate (similar to 10-10(4) s) durations and setting upper limits on continuous emissions from unknown pulsars.

TI Nuclear two point correlation functions on a quantum computer
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW D
AB The calculation of dynamic response functions is expected to be an early application benefiting from rapidly developing quantum hardware resources. The ability to calculate real-time quantities of strongly correlated quantum systems is one of the most exciting applications that can easily reach beyond the capabilities of traditional classical hardware. Response functions of fermionic systems at moderate momenta and energies corresponding roughly to the Fermi energy of the system are a potential early application because the relevant operators are nearly local, and the energies can be resolved in moderately short real time, reducing the spatial resolution and gate depth required. This is particularly the case in quasielastic electron and neutrino scattering from nuclei, a topic of great interest in the nuclear and particle physics communities and directly related to experiments designed to probe neutrino properties. In this work we use current quantum hardware and error mitigation protocols to calculate response functions for a highly simplified nuclear model through calculations of a 2-point real time correlation function for a modified Fermi-Hubbard model in two dimensions with three distinguishable nucleons on four lattice sites.

Kitaev chain is an example of a new class of quantum critical phenomena-the topological phase transition. Mapping Pauli's spin operators of transverse field quantum Ising chain to spinless fermionic creation and annihilation operators by inverse Jordan-Wigner transformation leads to a Hamiltonian form closely related Kitaev chain.

TI Improving the performance of reference-frame-independent quantum key
   distribution with advantage distillation technology
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB The reference-frame-independent quantum key distribution (RFI-QKD) has the advantage of tolerating reference frames that slowly vary. It can generate secure keys between two remote users with slowly drifted and unknown reference frames. However, the drift of reference frames may inevitably compromise the performance of QKD systems. In the paper, we employ the advantage distillation technology (ADT) to the RFI-QKD and the RFI measurement-device-independent QKD (RFI MDI-QKD), and we then analyze the effect of ADT on the performance of decoy-state RFI-QKD and RFI MDI-QKD in both asymptotic and nonasymptotic cases. The simulation results show that ADT can significantly improve the maximum transmission distance and the maximum tolerable background error rate. Furthermore, the performance of RFI-QKD and RFI MDI-QKD in terms of the secret key rate and maximum transmission distance are still greatly improved when statistical fluctuations are taken into account. Our work combines the merits of the ADT and RFI-QKD protocols, which further enhances the robustness and practicability of QKD systems.

AB The min-entropy of a quantum system A conditioned on another quantum system E describes how much randomness can be extracted from A with respect to an adversary in possession of E. This quantity plays a crucial role in quantum cryptography: the security proofs of many quantum cryptographic protocols reduce to showing a lower bound on such a min-entropy. Here, we develop a new tool, called generalised entropy accumulation, for computing such bounds. Concretely, we consider a sequential process in which each step outputs a system A(i) and updates a side information register E. We prove that if this process satisfies a natural "non-signalling" condition between past outputs and future side information, the min-entropy of the outputs A(1),..., A(n) conditioned on the side information E at the end of the process can be bounded from below by a sum of von Neumann entropies associated with the individual steps. This is a generalisation of the entropy accumulation theorem (EAT) [1], which deals with a more restrictive model of side information: there, past side information cannot be updated in subsequent rounds, and newly generated side information has to satisfy a Markov condition. Due to its more general model of side-information, our generalised EAT can be applied more easily and to a broader range of cryptographic protocols. In particular, it is the first general tool that is applicable to mistrustful device-independent cryptography. To demonstrate this, we give the first security proof for blind randomness expansion [2] against general adversaries. Furthermore, our generalised EAT can be used to give improved security proofs for quantum key distribution [3], and also has applications beyond quantum cryptography.

TI GATE GENERATION FOR OPEN QUANTUM SYSTEMS VIA A MONOTONIC ALGORITHM WITH
   TIME OPTIMIZATION
SO MATHEMATICAL CONTROL AND RELATED FIELDS
AB We present a monotonic numerical algorithm including time optimization for generating quantum gates for open systems. Such systems are assumed to be governed by Lindblad master equations for the density operators on a large Hilbert-space whereas the quantum gates are relative to a sub-space of small dimension. Starting from an initial seed of the control input, this algorithm consists in the repetition of the following two steps producing a new control input: (A) backwards integration of adjoint Lindblad-Master equations (in the Heisenberg-picture) from a set of final conditions encoding the quantum gate to generate; (B) forward integration of Lindblad-Master equations in closed-loop where a Lyapunov based control produced the new control input. The numerical stability is ensured by the stability of both the open-loop adjoint backward system and the forward closed-loop system. A clock-control input can be added to the usual control input. The obtained monotonic algorithm allows then to optimise not only the shape of the control input, but also the gate time. Preliminary numerical implementations indicate that this algorithm is well suited for cat-qubit gates, where Hilbert-space dimensions (2 for the Z-gate and 4 for the CNOT-gate) are much smaller than the dimension of the physical Hilbert-space involving mainly Fock-states (typically 20 or larger for a single cat-qubit). This monotonic algorithm, based on Lyapunov control techniques, is shown to have a straightforward interpretation in terms of optimal control: its stationary conditions coincides with the first-order optimality conditions for a cost depending linearly on the final values of the quantum states.

TI Selectively steering photon spin angular momentum via electron-induced
   optical spin Hall effect
SO SCIENCE ADVANCES
AB The development of the optical spin Hall effect (OSHE) realizes the splitting of different spin components, contributing to the manipulation of photon spin angular momentum that acts as the information carrier for quantum technology. However, OSHE with optical excitation lacks active control of photon angular momentum at deep subwavelength scale because of the optical diffraction limit. Here, we experimentally demonstrate a selective manipulation of photon spin angular momentum at a deep subwavelength scale via electron-induced OSHE in Au nanoantennas. The inversion of the OSHE radiation pattern is observed by angle-resolved cathodoluminescence polarimetry with the electron impact position shifting within 80 nm in a single antenna unit. By this selective steering of photon spin, we propose an information encoding with robustness, privacy, and high level of integration at a deep subwavelength scale for the future quantum applications.

TI Subdiffraction Distance Measurement of Dipolar Emitting Qubit Pairs
SO ACS PHOTONICS
AB In this work, we present a possibility to measure the distance between two color centers far below the diffraction limit of light in the optical wavelength range using a confocal fluorescence microscope. For this purpose, we show how the process of fabricating nitrogen-vacancy (NV)-based qubits in diamond by ion implantation with lithography masks is carried out. These masks contain small holes down to 80 nm in diameter in which the qubits are formed. A method to systematically identify the spots with exactly two qubits, the photons of which are polarized perpendicular to each other, is introduced. Further, an optical polarization dependent photoluminescene measurement principle is shown to determine the projected color center distances in several spots between 16 and 95 nm. It is thus possible to precisely determine the positions and distances of two quantum bits with a standard deviation of less than 10 nm for most measurements. This will enable a simple, systematic procedure for finding suitable qubit systems for quantum applications.

TI Dressed Interference in Giant Superatoms: Entanglement Generation and
   Transfer
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB We introduce the concept of giant superatoms (GSAs), where two or more interacting atoms are nonlocally coupled to a waveguide through one of them, and explore their unconventional quantum dynamics. For braided GSAs, this setup enables decoherence-free transfer and swapping of their internal entangled states. For separate GSAs, engineering coupling phases leads to state-dependent chiral emission, which enables selective, directional quantum information transfer. This mechanism further facilitates remote generation of W-class entangled states. Our results thereby open exciting possibilities for quantum networks and quantum information processing.

TI Controlled cyclic remote preparation
SO COMMUNICATIONS IN THEORETICAL PHYSICS
AB Multi-party quantum communication has gradually attracted widespread attention. To realize the perfect transmission of quantum states among multiple participants, a novel multi-party controlled cyclic remote preparation protocol for arbitrary single-qubit states with three senders is proposed. With the permission of one controller, each sender can transmit an arbitrary single-qubit state to its neighbor. In addition, we give a universal protocol for multi-party controlled cyclic remote preparation of arbitrary single-qubit states in the case of multiple senders, which can realize deterministic cyclic preparation of multiple quantum states in one direction. The scheme shows that the communication task can be successfully achieved only if all senders cooperate with the controller, and there is no need for the senders to employ information splitting and additional operations before performing measurements. Finally, we discuss the cyclic remote preparation protocol with three senders under five types of noisy environment, and the closeness between the output state and original state is measured by calculating fidelity.

TI Thresholds for the distributed surface code in the presence of memory
   decoherence
SO AVS QUANTUM SCIENCE
AB In the search for scalable, fault-tolerant quantum computing, distributed quantum computers are promising candidates. These systems can be realized in large-scale quantum networks or condensed onto a single chip with closely situated nodes. We present a framework for numerical simulations of a memory channel using the distributed toric surface code, where each data qubit of the code is part of a separate node, and the error-detection performance depends on the quality of four-qubit Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) states generated between the nodes. We quantitatively investigate the effect of memory decoherence and evaluate the advantage of GHZ creation protocols tailored to the level of decoherence. We do this by applying our framework for the particular case of color centers in diamond, employing models developed from experimental characterization of nitrogen-vacancy centers. For diamond color centers, coherence times during entanglement generation are orders of magnitude lower than coherence times of idling qubits. These coherence times represent a limiting factor for applications, but previous surface code simulations did not treat them as such. Introducing limiting coherence times as a prominent noise factor makes it imperative to integrate realistic operation times into simulations and incorporate strategies for operation scheduling. Our model predicts error probability thresholds for gate and measurement reduced by at least a factor of three compared to prior work with more idealized noise models. We also find a threshold of 4 x 10 2 in the ratio between the entanglement generation and the decoherence rates, setting a benchmark for experimental progress. C2024 Author(s).

TI Anomaly inflow, dualities, and quantum simulation of Abelian lattice
   gauge theories induced by measurements
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Previous work [SciPost Phys. 14, 129 (2023)] has demonstrated that quantum simulation of Abelian lattice gauge theories (Wegner models including the toric code in a limit) in general dimensions can be achieved by local adaptive measurements on symmetry-protected topological (SPT) states with higher-form generalized global symmetries. The entanglement structure of the resource SPT state reflects the geometric structure of the gauge theory. In this work we explicitly demonstrate the anomaly inflow mechanism between the deconfining phase of the simulated gauge theory on the boundary and the SPT state in the bulk by showing that the anomalous gauge variation of the boundary state obtained by bulk measurement matches that of the bulk theory. Moreover, we construct the resource state and the measurement pattern for the measurement-based quantum simulation of a lattice gauge theory with a matter field (Fradkin-Shenker model), where a simple scheme to protect gauge invariance of the simulated state against errors is proposed. We further consider taking an overlap between the wave function of the resource state for lattice gauge theories and that of a parameterized product state, and we derive precise dualities between partition functions with insertion of defects corresponding to gauging higher-form global symmetries, as well as measurement-induced phases where states induced by a partial overlap possess different (symmetry-protected) topological orders. Measurement-assisted operators to dualize quantum Hamiltonians of lattice gauge theories and their noninvertibility are also presented.

TI Scalable narrow linewidth high power laser for barium ion optical qubits
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB The linewidth of a laser plays a pivotal role in ensuring the high fidelity of ion trap quantum processors and optical clocks. As quantum computing endeavors scale up in qubit number, the demand for higher laser power with ultra-narrow linewidth becomes imperative, and leveraging fiber amplifiers emerges as a promising approach to meet these requirements. This study explores the effectiveness of thulium-doped fiber amplifiers (TDFAs) as a viable solution for addressing optical qubit transitions in trapped barium ion qubits. We demonstrate that by performing high-fidelity gates on the qubit while introducing minimal intensity noise, TDFAs do not significantly broaden the linewidth of the seed lasers. We employed a Voigt fitting scheme in conjunction with a delayed self-heterodyne method to accurately measure the linewidth independently, corroborating our findings through quadrupole spectroscopy with trapped barium ions. Our results show linewidth values of 160 +/- 15 Hz and 156 +/- 16 Hz, respectively, using these two methods, underscoring the reliability of our measurement techniques. The slight variation within the error -bars of the two methods can be attributed to factors such as amplified spontaneous emission in the TDFA or the influence of 1/f noise within the heterodyne setup delay line. These contribute to advancing our understanding of laser linewidth control in the context of ion trap quantum computing as well as stretching the availability of narrow linewidth, high-power tunable lasers beyond the C-band.

TI Dynamics of a two-qubit Tavis-Cummings model in the presence of an
   Ising-type interaction between qubits
SO COMPUTER OPTICS
AB In this paper, we investigated the dynamics of entanglement of two qubits interacting non- resonantly with the thermal field of a one-mode lossless resonator, taking into account the Isingtype direct interaction between qubits. Based on the exact solution of the quantum Liouville equation, we found the density matrix of the system under consideration. With its help, the reduced qubit-qubit density matrix was calculated and the entanglement criteri & ocy;n of the two-qubit system, Pres-Horode & scy;ki parameter, was found. It was shown that for the resonance model and separable initial states of qubits, the direct interaction of qubits leads to a significant increase in the maximum degree of their entanglement. It was also found that for the nonresonant interaction between qubits and field, the increase of the maximum degree of entanglement of qubits is much greater than that due to direct interaction. For the original entangled Bell-type state of the qubits, the direct interaction was found to lead to the vanishing of the effect of the sudden death of entanglement in the case of a resonant qubit-field interaction and, conversely, to an increase in this effect for a nonresonant interaction.

TI Noise-resilient quantum power flow
SO IENERGY
AB Quantum power flow (QPF) offers an inspiring direction for overcoming the computation challenge of power flow through quantum computing. However, the practical implementation of existing QPF algorithms in today's noisy-intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) era remains limited because of their sensitivity to noise. This paper establishes an NISQ-QPF algorithm that enables power flow computation on noisy quantum devices. The main contributions include: (1) a variational quantum circuit (VQC)-based alternating current (AC) power flow formulation, which enables QPF using short-depth quantum circuits; (2) NISQ-compatible QPF solvers based on the variational quantum linear solver (VQLS) and modified fast decoupled power flow; and (3) an error-resilient QPF scheme to relieve the QPF iteration deviations caused by noise; (3) a practical NISQ-QPF framework for implementable and reliable power flow analysis on noisy quantum machines. Extensive simulation tests validate the accuracy and generality of NISQ-QPF for solving practical power flow on IBM's real, noisy quantum computers.

TI Error Mitigation of Grover's Quantum Search Algorithm
SO INDIAN JOURNAL OF PURE & APPLIED PHYSICS
AB Grover's quantum search algorithm delivers quadratic speedup over classical counterparts for finding an item in unstructured database. But the accuracy of the algorithm degrades as the number of qubits are increased. Noises of various types affect the accuracy of the Grover's algorithm. The imperfect measurement on the qubit results in measurement errors appears to be one of the factors which limit the scalability of near-term quantum devices/algorithms. This paper is focused on the implementation of measurement error mitigation technique on Grover's algorithm up to 4-qubit. The measurement error mitigation model for Grover's algorithm is developed and implemented on the real-time quantum computer. The accuracy of Grover's algorithm up to 4-qubits with and without measurement errors is evaluated and compared. The results indicate that measurement error mitigation technique mitigates the measurement errors of the Grover's algorithm and improves its accuracy.

TI Quantum Information Supports Delayed Decisions
SO ENTROPY
AB Chatbots, search engines and Database Query Systems are invaluable sources of information for decision-making processes in the data-driven world in which we live today. In this study, we explore the extent to which classical and Quantum Query Systems can support future decisions, taken at a moment where the query service may be inaccessible and the decision has to be based solely on information collected in the past. We show that encoding information at the quantum level allows Query Systems to support future or delayed decisions. More precisely, Grover's algorithm can be employed in order to extract the desired answer from a large superposition of question-answer pairs obtained through a single interrogation of the system. The method works best for binary answers and can be applied to queries encompassing hundreds or thousands of questions in one query. Extensions are possible if we allow more than one query to be addressed to the system. By comparison, a classical system would require hundreds or thousands of queries in order to offer the same level of support for delayed decisions.

TI Hybrid Tree Tensor Networks for Quantum Simulation
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB Hybrid tensor networks (hTNs) offer a promising solution for encoding variational quantum states beyond the capabilities of efficient classical methods or noisy quantum computers alone. However, their practical usefulness and many operational aspects of hTN-based algorithms, like the optimization of hTNs, the generalization of standard contraction rules to an hybrid setting, and the design of application-oriented architectures have not been thoroughly investigated yet. In this work, we introduce a novel algorithm to perform ground-state optimizations with hybrid tree tensor networks (hTTNs), discussing its advantages and roadblocks, and identifying a set of promising applications. We benchmark our approach on two paradigmatic models, namely the Ising model at the critical point and the Toric-code Hamiltonian. In both cases, we successfully demonstrate that hTTNs can improve upon classical equivalents with equal bond dimension in the classical part.

The findings of this work include on the one hand extended applicability of the quantum Fourier transform to the ring learning with errors problem which has been left open by Grilo et al., who first devised a polynomial-time quantum algorithm for solving noisy linear problems with quantum samples. On the other hand, this paper also shows there exist efficient classical algorithms for short integer solution and size-reduced learning with errors problems if the quantum samples used by the previous studies are given.

TI Nanoscale Mapping of the 3D Strain Tensor in a Germanium Quantum Well
   Hosting a Functional Spin Qubit Device
SO ACS APPLIED MATERIALS & INTERFACES
AB A strained Ge quantum well, grown on a SiGe/Si virtual substrate and hosting two electrostatically defined hole spin qubits, is nondestructively investigated by synchrotron-based scanning X-ray diffraction microscopy to determine all its Bravais lattice parameters. This allows rendering the three-dimensional spatial dependence of the six strain tensor components with a lateral resolution of approximately 50 nm. Two different spatial scales governing the strain field fluctuations in proximity of the qubits are observed at <100 nm and >1 mu m, respectively. The short-ranged fluctuations have a typical bandwidth of 2 x 10-4 and can be quantitatively linked to the compressive stressing action of the metal electrodes defining the qubits. By finite element mechanical simulations, it is estimated that this strain fluctuation is increased up to 6 x 10-4 at cryogenic temperature. The longer ranged fluctuations are of the 10-3 order and are associated with misfit dislocations in the plastically relaxed virtual substrate. From this, energy variations of the light and heavy-hole energy maxima of the order of several 100 mu eV and 1 meV are calculated for electrodes and dislocations, respectively. These insights over material-related inhomogeneities may feed into further modeling for optimization and design of large-scale quantum processors manufactured using the mainstream Si-based microelectronics technology.

TI Optimal and Variational Multiparameter Quantum Metrology and
   Vector-Field Sensing
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB We study multiparameter sensing of two-dimensional (2D) and three-dimensional (3D) vector fields within the Bayesian framework for SU(2) quantum interferometry. We establish a method to determine the optimal quantum sensor, which establishes the fundamental limit on the precision of simultaneously estimating multiple parameters with an N-atom sensor. Keeping current experimental platforms in mind, we present sensors that have limited entanglement capabilities and yet significantly outperform sensors that operate without entanglement and approach the optimal quantum sensor in terms of performance. Furthermore, we show how these sensors can be implemented on current programmable quantum sensors with variational quantum circuits by minimizing a metrological cost function. The resulting circuits prepare tailored entangled states and perform measurements in an appropriate entangled basis to realize the best-possible quantum sensor given the native entangling resources available on a given sensor platform. Notable examples include a 2D and 3D quantum "compass" and a 2D sensor that provides a scalable improvement over unentangled sensors. Our results on optimal and variational multiparameter quantum metrology are useful for advancing precision measurements in fundamental science and ensuring the stability of quantum computers, which can be achieved through the incorporation of optimal quantum sensors in a quantum feedback loop.

TI Topological rejection of noise by quantum skyrmions
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB An open challenge in the context of quantum information processing and communication is improving the robustness of quantum information to environmental contributions of noise, a severe hindrance in real-world scenarios. Here, we show that quantum skyrmions and their nonlocal topological observables remain resilient to noise even as typical entanglement witnesses and measures of the state decay. This allows us to introduce the notion of digitization of quantum information based on our discrete topological quantum observables, foregoing the need for robustness of entanglement. We compliment our experiments with a full theoretical treatment that unlocks the quantum mechanisms behind the topological behavior, explaining why the topology leads to robustness. Our approach holds exciting promise for intrinsic quantum information resilience through topology, highly applicable to real-world systems such as global quantum networks and noisy quantum computers.

TI Quantum information theoretic approach to the hard problem of
   consciousness
SO BIOSYSTEMS
AB Functional theories of consciousness, based on emergence of conscious experiences from the execution of a particular function by an insentient brain, face the hard problem of consciousness of explaining why the insentient brain should produce any conscious experiences at all. This problem is exacerbated by the determinism characterizing the laws of classical physics, due to the resulting lack of causal potency of the emergent consciousness, which is not present already as a physical quantity in the deterministic equations of motion of the brain. Here, we present a quantum information theoretic approach to the hard problem of consciousness that avoids all of the drawbacks of emergence. This is achieved through reductive identification of first-person subjective conscious states with unobservable quantum state vectors in the brain, whereas the anatomically observable brain is viewed as a third-person objective construct created by classical bits of information obtained during the measurement of a subset of commuting quantum brain observables by the environment. Quantum resource theory further implies that the quantum features of consciousness granted by quantum no-go theorems cannot be replicated by any classical physical device.

TI High-Fidelity Measurement of a Superconducting Qubit Using an On-Chip
   Microwave Photon Counter
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW X
AB We describe an approach to the high-fidelity measurement of a superconducting qubit using an on-chip microwave photon counter. The protocol relies on the transient response of a dispersively coupled measurement resonator to map the state of the qubit to "bright" and "dark" cavity pointer states that are characterized by a large differential photon occupation. Following this mapping, we photodetect the resonator using the Josephson photomultiplier, which transitions between classically distinguishable flux states when cavity photon occupation exceeds a certain threshold. Our technique provides access to the binary outcome of projective quantum measurement at the millikelvin stage without the need for quantum-limited preamplification and thresholding at room temperature. We achieve raw single-shot measurement fidelity in excess of 98% across multiple samples using this approach in total measurement times under 500 ns. In addition, we show that the backaction and crosstalk associated with our measurement protocol can be mitigated by exploiting the intrinsic damping of the Josephson photomultiplier itself.

TI Sending or Not-Sending Twin-Field Quantum Key Distribution with Flawed
   and Leaky Sources
SO ENTROPY
AB Twin-field quantum key distribution (TF-QKD) has attracted considerable attention and developed rapidly due to its ability to surpass the fundamental rate-distance limit of QKD. However, the device imperfections may compromise its practical implementations. The goal of this paper is to make it robust against the state preparation flaws (SPFs) and side channels at the light source. We adopt the sending or not-sending (SNS) TF-QKD protocol to accommodate the SPFs and multiple optical modes in the emitted states. We analyze that the flaws of the phase modulation can be overcome by regarding the deviation of the phase as phase noise and eliminating it with the post-selection of phase. To overcome the side channels, we extend the generalized loss-tolerant (GLT) method to the four-intensity decoy-state SNS protocol. Remarkably, by decomposing of the two-mode single-photon states, the phase error rate can be estimated with only four parameters. The practical security of the SNS protocol with flawed and leaky source can be guaranteed. Our results might constitute a crucial step towards guaranteeing the practical implementation of the SNS protocol.

TI Multipartite Entanglement in Rabi-Driven Superconducting Qubits
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB Exploring highly connected networks of qubits is invaluable for implementing various quantum algo-rithms and simulations. All-to-all connectivity allows for entangling qubits with reduced gate depth. On trapped ion quantum processors, the shared motional degree of freedom is routinely used to simultaneously entangle over a dozen qubits with high fidelity in the Molmer-Sorensen gate. Here, we demonstrate the first implementation of a Molmer-Sorensen-like interaction in circuit quantum electrodynamics through assisted by a shared photonic mode and Rabi driven qubits, which relaxes restrictions on qubit frequen-cies during fabrication and supports scalability. We achieve a two-qubit entangled state with maximum state fidelity or 97% in 310 ns and a three-qubit GHZ state with fidelity 90.5% in 217 ns, and a four-qubit GHZ state with 66% fidelity. The four-qubit gate is limited by shared resonator losses and the spread of qubit-resonator couplings, which must be addressed for high fidelity operations. Exploring highly con-nected networks of qubits is invaluable for implementing various quantum algorithms and simulations as it allows for entangling qubits with reduced circuit depth. Here, we demonstrate a multi-qubit STAR (Sideband Tone Assisted Rabi driven) gate. Our scheme is inspired by the ion qubit Molmer-Sorensen gate and is mediated by a shared photonic mode and Rabi-driven superconducting qubits, which relaxes restrictions on qubit frequencies during fabrication and supports scalability. We achieve a two-qubit gate with maximum state fidelity of 95% in 310 ns, a three-qubit gate with state fidelity 90.5% in 217 ns, and a four-qubit gate with state fidelity 66% in 200 ns. Furthermore, we develop a model of the gate that show the four-qubit gate is limited by shared resonator losses and the spread of qubit-resonator couplings, which must be addressed to reach high-fidelity operations.

TI Spin-Qubit Noise Spectroscopy of Magnetic
   Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless Physics
SO NANO LETTERS
AB We propose using spin-qubit noise magnetometry to probe dynamical signatures of magnetic Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) physics. For a nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center coupled to two-dimensional XY magnets, we predict distinctive features in the magnetic noise spectral density in the sub-MHz to GHz frequency range. In the quasi-long-range ordered phase, the spectrum exhibits a temperature-dependent power law characteristic of algebraic spin correlations. Above the transition, the noise reflects the proliferation of free vortices and enables quantitative extraction of the vortex conductivity, a key parameter of vortex transport. These results highlight NV as a powerful spectroscopic method to resolve magnetic dynamics in the mesoscopic and low-frequency regimes and to probe exotic magnetic phase transitions.

TI QPDE: Quantum Neural Network Based Stabilization Parameter Prediction
   for Numerical Solvers for Partial Differential Equations
SO APPLIEDMATH
AB We propose a Quantum Neural Network (QNN) for predicting stabilization parameter for solving Singularly Perturbed Partial Differential Equations (SPDE) using the Streamline Upwind Petrov Galerkin (SUPG) stabilization technique. SPDE-Q-Net, a QNN, is proposed for approximating an optimal value of the stabilization parameter for SUPG for 2-dimensional convection-diffusion problems. Our motivation for this work stems from the recent progress made in quantum computing and the striking similarities observed between neural networks and quantum circuits. Just like how weight parameters are adjusted in traditional neural networks, the parameters of the quantum circuit, specifically the qubits' degrees of freedom, can be fine-tuned to learn a nonlinear function. The performance of SPDE-Q-Net is found to be at par with SPDE-Net, a traditional neural network-based technique for stabilization parameter prediction in terms of the numerical error in the solution. Also, SPDE-Q-Net is found to be faster than SPDE-Net, which projects the future benefits which can be earned from the speed-up capabilities of quantum computing.

TI Quantum correlations across the horizon in acoustic and gravitational
   black holes
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW D
AB We investigate, within the framework of quantum field theory in curved space, the correlations across the horizon of a black hole in order to highlight the particle-partner pair creation mechanism at the origin of Hawking radiation. The analysis concerns both acoustic black holes, formed by Bose-Einstein condensates, and gravitational black holes. More precisely, we have considered a typical acoustic black hole metric with two asymptotic homogeneous regions and the Schwarzschild metric as describing a gravitational black hole. By considering equal-time correlation functions, we find a striking disagreement between the two cases: the expected characteristic peak centered along the trajectories of the Hawking particles and their partners seems to appear only for the acoustic black hole and not for the gravitational Schwarzschild one. The reason for that is the existence of a quantum atmosphere displaced from the horizon as the locus of origin of Hawking radiation together, and this is the crucial aspect, with the presence of a central singularity in the gravitational case swallowing everything is trapped inside the horizon. Correlations, however, are not absent in the gravitational case; to see them, one simply has to consider correlation functions at unequal times, which indeed display the expected peak.

TI Negativity-mutual information conversion and coherence in two-coupled
   harmonic oscillators
SO PHYSICA A-STATISTICAL MECHANICS AND ITS APPLICATIONS
AB Quantum information is a common topic of research in many areas of quantum physics, such as quantum communication and quantum computation, as well as quantum thermodynamics. It can be encoded in discrete or continuous variable systems, with the appropriated formalism to treat it generally depending on the quantum system to be chosen. For continuous variable systems, it is convenient to employ a quasi-probability function to represent quantum states and non-classical signatures. The Wigner function is a special quasi-probability function because it allows to describe a quantum system in the phase space very similar to the classical one. In this work we consider some informational aspects of two-mode continuous-variables systems. In particular we illustrate how the mutual information may be useful to transfer the non-Gaussianity property between two states. Moreover, the coherence of a Gaussian state is studied when the system is coupled to a thermal reservoir but also with an extra single-mode Gaussian state. Our results may be, in principle, investigated in trapped ions setups, where the two-mode system can be encoded in the vibrational modes of the ion. (C) 2021 Published by Elsevier B.V.

TI Anti-crossings and spectral gap during quantum adiabatic evolution
SO QUANTUM INFORMATION PROCESSING
AB We aim to give more insights into adiabatic evolution concerning the occurrence of anti-crossings and their link to the spectral minimum gap Delta(min). We study in detail adiabatic quantum computation applied to a specific combinatorial problem called weighted max k-clique. A clear intuition of the parametrization introduced by V. Choi is given which explains why the characterization is not general enough. We show that the instantaneous vectors involved in the anti-crossing vary brutally through it making the instantaneous ground-state hard to follow during the evolution. This result leads to a relaxation of the parametrization to be more general.

TI Sharing EPR steering between sequential pairs of observers
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICS A-MATHEMATICAL AND THEORETICAL
AB The recycling of quantum correlations has attracted widespread attention both theoretically and experimentally. Previous works show that bilateral sharing of nonlocality is impossible under mild measurement strategy and 2-qubit entangled state can be used to witness entanglement arbitrary many times by sequential and independent pairs of observers. However, less is known about the bilateral sharing of EPR steering yet. Here, we aim at investigating the EPR steering sharing between sequential pairs of observers. We show that an unbounded number of sequential Alice-Bob pairs can share the EPR steering as long as the initially shared state is an entangled two-qubit pure state. The claim is also true for particular class of mixed entangled states.

TI Interaction of two quantum dots mediated by edge modes of coupled-cavity
   arrays
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB Topological photonics is a hot topic in recent years. We combine it with the quantum optics and explore the dynamics of two quantum dots (QDs) separated by the finite coupled-cavity arrays (CCAs). The finite CCAs possessing the alternating hopping strengths will lead to the existence of the topological protected edge modes, also called zero energy modes, when the boundaries leave the weak hopping at two ends. Due to the two edge modes, i.e., symmetric and antisymmetric, with nearly degenerate frequencies, the dynamics of two QDs coupled to the cavities at both ends exhibit complicated behaviors. When the CCAs are composed of a large number of cavities, there are two kinds of phenomena: if the coupling between QDs and cavity is weak, two edge modes will cancel each other out and isolate two QDs deeply; if the coupling between QDs and cavities is large compared with hopping strength, the edge mode disappears and two QDs can be connected through extend modes. Importantly, when the CCAs are formed by a small number of cavities, energy can be transferred to each other between two QDs through the edge modes. Such energy transfer is topologically protected, and the period is long and easily controlled. We also investigate the effects of topologically protected quantum entangled states on such system and find that the quantum entanglement can be well kept or generated for appropriate choices of system parameters and initial states. The investigations enrich the manifestation of topological physics and are helpful to apply the topological protection to quantum computation and quantum communication.

TI Experimental preparation of multiphoton-added coherent states of light
SO NPJ QUANTUM INFORMATION
AB Conditional addition of photons represents a crucial tool for optical quantum state engineering and it forms a fundamental building block of advanced quantum photonic devices. Here we report on experimental implementation of the conditional addition of several photons. We demonstrate the addition of one, two, and three photons to input coherent states with various amplitudes. The resulting highly nonclassical photon-added states are completely characterized with time-domain homodyne tomography, and the nonclassicality of the prepared states is witnessed by the negativity of their Wigner functions. We experimentally demonstrate that the conditional addition of photons realizes approximate noiseless quantum amplification of coherent states with sufficiently large amplitude. We also investigate certification of the stellar rank of the generated multiphoton-added coherent states, which quantifies the non-Gaussian resources required for their preparation. Our results pave the way towards the experimental realization of complex optical quantum operations based on combination of multiple photon additions and subtractions.

TI Enhancing nonclassical correlations for light scattered by an ensemble

SO OPTICS LETTERS
AB We report the enhancement of quantum correlations for biphotons generated via spontaneous four-wave mixing in an ensemble of cold two-level atoms. This enhancement is based on the filtering of the Rayleigh linear compo-nent of the spectrum of the two emitted photons, favoring the quantum-correlated sidebands reaching the detectors. We provide direct measurements of the unfiltered spec-trum presenting its usual triplet structure, with Rayleigh central components accompanied by two peaks symmetri-cally located at the detuning of the excitation laser with respect to the atomic resonance. The filtering of the central component results in a violation of the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality to (4.8 & PLUSMN; 1.0) & NLE; 1 for a detuning of 60 times the atomic linewidth, representing an enhancement by a factor of four compared with the unfiltered quantum correlations observed at the same conditions. & COPY; 2023 Optica Publishing Group

TI Round-Robin Differential Phase-Time-Shifting Protocol for Quantum Key
   Distribution: Theory and Experiment
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW APPLIED
AB Quantum key distribution (QKD) allows the establishment of common cryptographic keys among distant parties. Many of the QKD protocols that were introduced in the past, involve the challenge of monitoring the signal disturbance over the communication line, in order to evaluate the information leakage to a potential eavesdropper. Recently, a QKD protocol that circumvents the need for monitoring signal disturbance, has been proposed and demonstrated in initial experiments. Here, we propose an improved version of this so-called round-robin differential phase-shifting (RRDPS) protocol, in which both time and phase degrees of freedom are utilized to enlarge the Hilbert-space dimensionality, without increasing experimental complexity or relaxing security assumptions. We derive the security proofs of the roundrobin differential phase-time-shifting (RRDPTS) protocol in the collective attack scenario, and benchmark it against RRDPS for different experimental parameters. Furthermore, a proof-of-concept experiment of the RRDPTS protocol, using weak coherent pulses and decoy state method, is demonstrated over 80 km of fiber link. Our results show that the RRDPTS protocol can achieve higher secret key rate in comparison with the RRDPS, in the condition of high quantum bit error rate.

TI Remote Quantum-Safe Authentication of Entities with Physical Unclonable
   Functions
SO PHOTONICS
AB Physical unclonable functions have been shown to be a useful resource of randomness for implementing various cryptographic tasks including entity authentication. All the related entity authentication protocols that have been discussed in the literature so far, either they are vulnerable to an emulation attack, or they are limited to short distances. Hence, quantum-safe remote entity authentication over large distances remains an open question. In the first part of this work, we discuss the requirements that an entity authentication protocol has to offer, to be useful for remote entity authentication in practice. Subsequently, we propose a protocol, which can operate over large distances, and offers security against both classical and quantum adversaries. The proposed protocol relies on standard techniques, it is fully compatible with the infrastructure of existing and future photonic networks, and it can operate in parallel with other quantum protocols, including QKD protocols.

In particular, we study the seminal BBM92 protocol and find that an autocompensating technique is possible, although with severe limitations. This prompts the introduction of a different, more practical protocol based on Bell state exchange parity (BSEP), which allows for intrinsic autocompensation of optical fiber perturbations in various two-dimensional fiber-optic encodings while retaining advantageous MDI-QKD characteristics. We present the BSEP protocol in detail, describing both the quantum light propagation and the optical hardware requirements.

TI Quantum Mpemba prediction in three-qubit XYZ spin chains using low
   fractional orders
SO QUANTUM INFORMATION PROCESSING
AB In this work, we investigate the possibility of predicting the phenomena of the quantum Mpemba fractionally, where it is assumed that a single qubit, which is initially prepared in three different cases, hottest, hotter and colder states, interacting with its surroundings made up of two qubits via XYZ chain model in the presence of Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DM). The trace distance between the equilibrium and time fractional evolution of the system is used to predict the Mpemba phenomena. The impact of the interaction parameters and the fractional orders on the stabilization behavior of the qubit is discussed. It is shown that thermalization case is reached at small fraction order during a short interaction time. However, as one increases the fractional orders, the thermalization is observed at large interaction time. For ferromagnetic case and large strength of DM interaction, the stabilization behavior is predicted at small interaction time, while for anti-ferromagnetic and small values of DM, the stabilization is reached at large interaction time.

TI Classical and quantum cost of measurement strategies for
   quantum-enhanced auxiliary field quantum Monte Carlo
SO NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB Quantum-enhanced auxiliary field quantum Monte Carlo (QC-AFQMC) uses output from a quantum computer to increase the accuracy of its classical counterpart. The algorithm requires the estimation of overlaps between walker states and a trial wavefunction prepared on the quantum computer. We study the applicability of this algorithm in terms of the number of measurements required from the quantum computer and the classical costs of post-processing those measurements. We compare the classical post-processing costs of state-of-the-art measurement schemes using classical shadows to determine the overlaps and argue that the overall post-processing cost stemming from overlap estimations scales like O(N9) per walker throughout the algorithm. With further numerical simulations, we compare the variance behavior of the classical shadows when randomizing over different ensembles, e.g. Cliffords and (particle-number restricted) matchgates beyond their respective bounds, and uncover the existence of covariances between overlap estimations of the AFQMC walkers at different imaginary time steps. Moreover, we include analyses of how the error in the overlap estimation propagates into the AFQMC energy and discuss its scaling when increasing the system size.

TI Quantum simulation costs for Suzuki-Trotter decomposition of quantum
   many-body lattice models
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Quantum computers offer the potential to efficiently simulate the dynamics of quantum systems, a task whose difficulty scales exponentially with system size on classical devices. To assess the potential for near-term quantum computers to simulate many-body systems we develop a formalism to straightforwardly compute bounds on the number of Trotter steps needed to accurately simulate the time evolution of fermionic lattice models based on the first-order commutator scaling. We apply this formalism to two closely related many-body models prominent in condensed matter physics, the Hubbard and t-J models. We find that, while a naive comparison of the Trotter depth first seems to favor the Hubbard model, careful consideration of the model parameters and the allowable error for accurate simulation leads to a substantial advantage in favor of the t-J model. These results and formalism set the stage for significant improvements in quantum simulation costs.

TI Improving the Solving of Optimization Problems: A Comprehensive Review
   of Quantum Approaches
SO QUANTUM REPORTS
AB Optimization is a crucial challenge across various domains, including finance, resource allocation, and mobility. Quantum computing has the potential to redefine the way we handle complex problems by reducing computational complexity and enhancing solution quality. Optimization, particularly of objective functions, stands to benefit significantly from quantum solvers, which leverage principles of quantum mechanics like superposition, entanglement, and tunneling. The Ising and Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) models are the most suitable formulations for these solvers, involving binary variables and constraints treated as penalties within the overall objective function. To harness quantum approaches for optimization, two primary strategies are employed: exploiting quantum annealers-special-purpose optimization devices-and designing algorithms based on quantum circuits. This review provides a comprehensive overview of quantum optimization methods, examining their advantages, challenges, and limitations. It demonstrates their application to real-world scenarios and outlines the steps to convert generic optimization problems into quantum-compliant models. Lastly, it discusses available tools and frameworks that facilitate the exploration of quantum solutions for optimization tasks.

TI Review Quantum Circuit Synthesis for Grover's Algorithm Oracle
SO ALGORITHMS
AB The search for information in a system has been a continuous problem for a computer. This has resulted in the construction of a set of classical algorithms that can search for a set of data. This is why search systems can be divided into the type of information being searched, the number of solutions to find, and even the terms used for searching. With the emergence of quantum computing, new algorithms have been generated for this type of process. An example is the Grover algorithm, which performs theoretically better than traditional algorithms. This is why there has been research on optimizing it, applying it to new fields, and making it more accessible to industry users. Even if the algorithm is a promising alternative, one of the disadvantages of Grover's algorithm is the use of an oracle function that must be generated for every set of search data. This review describes three sets of methodologies for generating quantum circuits that can be applied to constructing this oracle quantum circuit.

TI Field-induced magnetic phases in a qubit Penrose quasicrystal
SO SCIENCE ADVANCES
AB Unveiling the fundamental dynamics of naturally or artificially formed magnetic quasicrystals in the presence of an external magnetic field remains a difficult problem that may have implications for the design of information processing devices. By embedding a qubit magnetic Penrose quasicrystal into a quantum annealer, we were able to reproduce the formation of magnetic phases driven by specific physical parameter selections, allowing us to distinguish a wide range of frustrated magnetic configurations at the single-spin scale. In our experiments, we observe some spins dynamically activate, while others remain static, all within an average magnetization space defined by competing structural and magnetic degrees of freedom. Static spin structure factors reveal ferromagnetic and ferrimagnetic modulations that are compatible with a variety of spin textures. This research demonstrates that introducing structural aperiodicity in magnetic devices that exploit spin degeneracy in a single, richly intraconnected finite object can enable the engineering of quantum states in both the effective low-temperature and thermally excited regimes.

TI Security of AUV-carried OIRS-assisted quantum key distribution links in
   underwater channels subject to misalignment
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB To establish a secure and high-bandwidth communication link between the gateway node and the central node in the inter net of underwater things (IoUwT), it is meaningful to introduce quantum key distribution (QKD) protocols into underwater wireless optical communication (UWOC) systems. However, the line-of-sight (LOS) requirement for photon transmission will pose an inevitable challenge to the QKD-based UWOC system. In this work, an optical intelligent reflecting surface (OIRS) array mounted on an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) is utilized for the first time to alleviate the LOS blockage and enable more reliable underwater wireless optical quantum link for both discrete-variable quantum key distribution (DV-QKD) and continuous-variable quantum key distribution (CV-QKD). To begin with, a novel statistical model of the aggregated channel transmissivity experienced by the OIRS-based quantum states in underwater link is derived by combing the effects of oceanic absorption, scattering, turbulence and OIRS misalignment, where the oceanic turbulence-induced irradiance fluctuation is modeled by exponential and generalized gamma (EGG) distribution, and the jitter angle associated with AUV-carried OIRS misalignment is characterized by a Rayleigh distribution. Then, on the basis of this statistical model and the Gauss-Chebyshev quadrature, the quantum bit error rate and the lower bound secret key rate (SKR) for the AUV-carried OIRS-assisted DV-QKD link are obtained with weak coherent optical source and decoy state idea by utilizing Gottesman-Lo-L & uuml;tkenhausPreskill. In terms of univariate Fox-H function, the average Pirandola-Laurenza-Ottaviani-Banchi (PLOB) bound over the bosonic pure-loss channel, as well as the thermal upper and lower bounds over the thermal-loss channel are both derived for the AUV-carried OIRS-assisted CV-QKD link. Additionally, the achievable SKR for a practical GG02 CV-QKD protocol in underwater channels is also presented through the worst-case analysis. Furthermore, the impacts of the number of OIRS elements, OIRS positioning, jitter variances, the probability of erroneous detection and link distance on the security performance of the proposed links are studied with different water types, thereby offering valuable insights for the QKD-based UWOC system in IoUwT.

TI Sketching phase diagrams using low-depth variational quantum algorithms
SO QUANTUM SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB Mapping out phase diagrams of quantum systems using classical simulations can be challenging or intractable due to the computational resources required to simulate even small quantum systems far away from the thermodynamic limit. We investigate using quantum computers and the variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) for this task. In contrast to the task of preparing the exact ground state using VQE, sketching phase diagrams might require less quantum resources and accuracy, because low fidelity approximations to the ground state may be enough to correctly identify different phases. We used classical numerical simulations of low-depth VQE circuits to compute order parameters for four well-studied spin and fermion models which represent a mix of 1D and 2D, and exactly-solvable and classically hard systems. We find that it is possible to predict the location of phase transitions up to reasonable accuracy using states produced by VQE even when their overlap with the true ground state is small. Further, we introduce a model-agnostic predictor of phase transitions based on the speed with which the VQE energy improves with respect to the circuit depth, and find that in some cases this is also able to predict phase transitions.

TI Stabilization of Kerr-cat qubits with quantum circuit refrigerator
SO NPJ QUANTUM INFORMATION
AB A periodically driven superconducting nonlinear resonator can implement a Kerr-cat qubit, which provides a promising route to a quantum computer with a long lifetime. However, the system is vulnerable to pure dephasing, which causes unwanted excitations outside the qubit subspace. Therefore, we require a refrigeration technology that confines the system in the qubit subspace. We theoretically study on-chip refrigeration for Kerr-cat qubits based on photon-assisted electron tunneling at tunneling junctions, called quantum circuit refrigerators (QCR). Rates of QCR-induced deexcitations of the system can be changed by more than four orders of magnitude by tuning a bias voltage across the tunneling junctions. Unwanted QCR-induced bit flips are greatly suppressed due to quantum interference in the tunneling process, and thus the long lifetime is preserved. The QCR can serve as a tunable dissipation source that stabilizes Kerr-cat qubits.

TI An effective way of characterizing the quantum nonlocality
SO QUANTUM INFORMATION PROCESSING
AB Nonlocality is a distinctive feature of quantum theory, which has been extensively studied for decades. It is found that the uncertainty principle determines the nonlocality of quantum mechanics. Here we show that various degrees of nonlocalities in correlated system can be characterized by the generalized uncertainty principle, by which the complementarity is attributed to the mutual dependence of observables. Concrete examples for different kinds of nonclassical phenomena pertaining to different orders of dependence are presented. We obtain the third-order "skewness nonlocality" and find that the Bell nonlocality turns out to be merely the second-order "variance nonlocality" and the fourth-order dependence contains the commutator squares, which hence is related to the quantum contextuality. More applications of the generalized uncertainty principle are expected.

TI Demonstration of a photonic router via quantum walks
SO NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB Motivated by the need for quantum computers to communicate between multiple, well separated qubits, we introduce the task of routing the quantum state from one input mode to a superposition of several output modes coherently. We report an experimental demonstration of a deterministic photonic routing protocol applied to an entangled state. We show in a quantum walk architecture, quantum networks perfectly route entangled states from an initial input mode to an arbitrary output mode coherently and deterministically. Our results demonstrate the key principle of a perfect router, opening a route toward data routing and transferring for quantum computing systems. The routing algorithm in our work can be applied to a wide range of physical systems, which provides a way for effective design of efficient routing protocols on practical quantum networks.

TI Research progress of quantum coherence performance and applications of
   micro/nano scale rare-earth doped crystals
SO ACTA PHYSICA SINICA
AB Rare-earth ion doped crystals possess stable solid state physicochemical properties and long optical coherence time and spin coherence time, thus showing important development prospect in quantum information science and technology area. Investigations on macroscopic bulk rare-earth single crystals have obtained many promising results, especially in the field of optical quantum memory. With the rapid development of quantum information science, a variety of new functions or multifunctional integrations are found in rare earth crystal systems, such as on chip quantum storage, microwave to optical frequency conversion, scalable quantum single photon sources, and quantum logic gates. As a result, beyond the macroscopic bulk rare-earth single crystals, micro/nano-scale rare-earth crystals have received much attention in recent years and they are regarded as promising candidates in highly integrated hybrid quantum systems and miniaturized quantum devices. Moreover, wet chemical method synthesized micro/nano-scale rare-earth crystals have lower growth difficulty and more flexible manipulation in volume, shape and composition. Therefore, exploring high-performance micro/nano-scale rare-earth crystals and precisely manipulating their quantum states have become one of the important directions in today's quantum information science and technology research. In this review, we first briefly introduce the basic concepts and high resolution spectroscopic techniques that are commonly used in rare earth ion doped crystals for quantum information science and technologies, such as hole burning technique and photon echo technique. Then we summarize comprehensively recent research status and development trends of rare earth ion doped polycrystalline nanoparticles, thin films, single crystal based micro systems, and some other micro/nano-scale rare earth platforms in terms of material fabrication, quantum coherence property, dephasing mechanisms, and also quantum device explorations. The latest research advances in quantum information applications such as quantum storage, quantum frequency conversion, quantum single photon sources and quantum logic gates are given. Finally, we discuss the possible optimization directions and strategies to improve the component design, material synthesis and quantum performance of micro/nano-scale rare earth crystals and their related quantum devices. This review highlights that the micro/nano-scale rare earth crystals may offer many new possibilities for designing quantum light-matter interfaces, thus are promising quantum systems to develop scalable and integrated quantum devices in the future.

TI Entanglement-based clock syntonization for quantum key distribution
   networks: Demonstration over a 50 km-long link
SO APPLIED PHYSICS LETTERS
AB We present the implementation of a time synchronization protocol as a part of an experimentally deployed entanglement-based quantum key distribution (QKD) link. The system is deployed over 48 km of optical fibers across the M & eacute;tropole C & ocirc;te d'Azur and enables secret cryptographic key exchange between two remote users, with an average rate of 7 kbps. We exploit the time correlation of paired photons generated by a high-quality source of energy-time entanglement implemented in the QKD link to synchronize two rubidium clocks located at the end stations. The level of stability achieved guarantees a time offset between the clocks under 12 ps at all time. We also show that this protocol requires less hardware than a typical synchronization protocol for QKD that would distribute a reference clock signal between the users. (c) 2025 Author(s).

TI Genuine Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen steering of three-qubit states by
   multiple sequential observers
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB We investigate the possibility of multiple uses of a single copy of a three-qubit state for detecting genuine tripartite Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR) steering. A pure three-qubit state of either the Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) type or W type is shared between two fixed observers in two wings and a sequence of multiple observers in the third wing who perform unsharp or nonprojective measurements. The measurement settings of each of the multiple observers in the third wing are independent and uncorrelated with the measurement settings and outcomes of the previous observers. In such setup, we investigate all possible types of (2 -> 1) and (1 -> 2) genuine tripartite EPR steering. For each case, we obtain an upper limit on the number of observers on the third wing who can demonstrate genuine EPR steering through the quantum violation of an appropriate tripartite steering inequality. We show that the GHZ state allows for a higher number of observers compared to the W state. Additionally, (1 -> 2) genuine steering is possible for a larger range of sharpness parameters compared to (2 -> 1) genuine steering cases.

TI Decoherence in a crystal-phase defined double quantum dot charge qubit
   strongly coupled to a high-impedance resonator
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Decoherence of a charge qubit is usually credited to charge noise in the environment. Here we show that charge noise may not be the limiting factor for the qubit coherence. To this end, we study coherence properties of a crystal-phase defined semiconductor nanowire double quantum dot (DQD) charge qubit strongly coupled to a high-impedance resonator using radio-frequency reflectometry. Response of this hybrid system is measured both at a charge noise sensitive operation point (with finite DQD detuning) and at an insensitive point (so-called sweet spot with zero detuning). A theoretical model based on the Jaynes-Cummings Hamiltonian matches the experimental results well and yields only a 10% difference in decoherence rates between the two cases, despite that the sensitivity to detuning charge noise differs by a factor of 5. Therefore, the charge noise is not limiting the coherence in this experiment with this type of semiconducting nanowire qubits.

TI A formally certified end-to-end implementation of Shor's factorization
   algorithm
SO PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF
   AMERICA
AB Quantum computing technology may soon deliver revolutionary improvements in algorithmic performance, but it is useful only if computed answers are correct. While hardware-level decoherence errors have garnered significant attention, a less recognized obstacle to correctness is that of human programming errors-"bugs." Techniques familiar to most programmers from the classical domain for avoiding, discovering, and diagnosing bugs do not easily transfer, at scale, to the quantum domain because of its unique characteristics. To address this problem, we have been working to adapt formal methods to quantum programming. With such methods, a programmer writes a mathematical specification alongside the program and semiautomatically proves the program correct with respect to it. The proof's validity is automatically confirmed- certified-by a "proof assistant." Formal methods have successfully yielded high assurance classical software artifacts, and the underlying technology has produced certified proofs of major mathematical theorems. As a demonstration of the feasibility of applying formal methods to quantum programming, we present a formally certified end-to-end implementation of Shor's prime factorization algorithm, developed as part of a framework for applying the certified approach to general applications. By leveraging our framework, one can significantly reduce the effects of human errors and obtain a high-assurance implementation of large-scale quantum applications in a principled way.

TI Exploration of Mechanisms of Aero-Optical Effects on Airborne Optical
   Communication and Quantum Secure Communication
SO LASER & OPTOELECTRONICS PROGRESS
AB Airborne platforms serve as an essential link in promoting the space-air-ground integrated wide-area optical/ quantum communication network. However, when airborne platforms operate at high speeds, aero-optical effects cause beam deviation, jitter, blur, energy attenuation, and other phenomena that affect the performance of optical/quantum communication systems. To begin, this paper delves into the study of aero-optical effects, and the effects of aero-optics on airborne optical communication are described and analyzed in terms of three aspects: the increased burden on the pointing, acquisition, and tracking system; interruption of the communication link; and decrease of communication quality. In addition, the beam shifts, increased transmission loss, and key rate degradation caused by aero-optical effects in several airborne quantum key distribution scenarios are presented. Finally, the challenges faced by airborne optical/quantum communication systems in transmission link optimization, system performance evaluation, and compensation method design are summarized, and the prospects for development in this field are outlined.

TI Crossing a topological phase transition with a quantum computer
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Quantum computers promise to perform computations beyond the reach of modern computers with profound implications for scientific research. Due to remarkable technological advances, small scale devices are now becoming available for use. One of the most apparent applications for such a device is the study of complex many-body quantum systems, where classical computers are unable to deal with the generic exponential complexity of quantum states. Even zero-temperature equilibrium phases of matter and the transitions between them have yet to be fully classified, with topologically protected phases presenting major difficulties. We construct and measure a continuously parametrized family of states crossing a symmetry protected topological phase transition on the IBM Q quantum computers. We present two complementary methods for measuring string order parameters that reveal the transition, and additionally analyze the effects of noise in the device using simple error models. The simulation that we perform is easily scalable and is a practical demonstration of the utility of near-term quantum computers for the study of quantum phases of matter and their transitions.

TI Quantum analysis of squiggle data
SO BIODATA MINING
AB Squiggle data is the numerical output of DNA and RNA sequencing by the Nanopore next generation sequencing platform. Nanopore sequencing offers expanded applications compared to previous sequencing techniques but produces a large amount of data in the form of current measurements over time. The analysis of these segments of current measurements require more complex and computationally intensive algorithms than previous sequencing technologies. The purpose of this study is to investigate in principle the potential of using quantum computers to speed up Nanopore data analysis. Quantum circuits are designed to extract major features of squiggle current measurements. The circuits are analyzed theoretically in terms of size and performance. Practical experiments on IBM QX show the limitations of the state of the art quantum computer to tackle real life squiggle data problems. Nevertheless, pre-processing of the squiggle data using the inverse wavelet transform, as experimented and analyzed in this paper as well, reduces the dimensionality of the problem in order to fit a reasonable size quantum computer in the hopefully near future.

TI Aspects of quantum information in finite density field theory
SO JOURNAL OF HIGH ENERGY PHYSICS
AB We study different aspects of quantum field theory at finite density using methods from quantum information theory. For simplicity we focus on massive Dirac fermions with nonzero chemical potential, and work in 1 + 1 space-time dimensions. Using the entanglement entropy on an interval, we construct an entropic c-function that is finite. Unlike what happens in Lorentz-invariant theories, this c-function exhibits a strong violation of monotonicity; it also encodes the creation of long-range entanglement from the Fermi surface. Motivated by previous works on lattice models, we next calculate numerically the Renyi entropies and find Friedel-type oscillations; these are understood in terms of a defect operator product expansion. Furthermore, we consider the mutual information as a measure of correlation functions between different regions. Using a long-distance expansion previously developed by Cardy, we argue that the mutual information detects Fermi surface correlations already at leading order in the expansion. We also analyze the relative entropy and its Renyi generalizations in order to distinguish states with different charge and/or mass. In particular, we show that states in different superselection sectors give rise to a super-extensive behavior in the relative entropy. Finally, we discuss possible extensions to interacting theories, and argue for the relevance of some of these measures for probing non-Fermi liquids.

TI Long-distance continuous-variable quantum key distribution over 100-km
   fiber with local local oscillator
SO SCIENCE ADVANCES
AB Quantum key distribution (QKD) enables two remote parties to share encryption keys with security based on the laws of physics. Continuous-variable (CV) QKD with coherent states and coherent detection integrates well with existing telecommunication networks. Thus far, long-distance CV-QKD has only been demonstrated using a highly complex scheme where the local oscillator is transmitted, opening security loopholes for eavesdroppers and limiting potential applications. Here, we report a long-distance CV-QKD experiment with a locally generated local oscillator over a 100-kilometer fiber channel with a total loss of 15.4 decibels. This record-breaking distance is achieved by controlling the phase noise-induced excess noise through a machine learning framework for carrier recovery and optimizing the modulation variance. We implement the full CV-QKD protocol and demonstrate the generation of keys secure against collective attacks in the finite-size regime. Our results mark a substantial milestone for realizing CV quantum access networks with a high loss budget and pave the way for large-scale deployment of secure QKD.

TI Side-channel-secure quantum key distribution with state-dependent
   correlated errors and Trojan-horse attack
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB Quantum key distribution (QKD) leverages the principles of quantum mechanics to provide theoretically unconditional security for cryptographic key sharing. However, practical implementations remain vulnerable due to potential security loopholes at both the source and detection sides of QKD systems. The side-channel-secure (SCS) protocol addresses these challenges by encoding bits in vacuum and non-vacuum states and introducing a third-party measurement node, thereby repelling attacks targeting the detection side as well as external lab attacks on the source side. In this work, we consider the state-dependent correlated errors and Trojan-horse attack while preserving the SCS protocol's key advantage--specifically, requiring only upper bounds on intensity characterization without needing a full description of quantum states in infinite dimensions. Numerical results demonstrate that when the reflected light intensity from Trojan-horse attacks falls below 10-6, Eve can scarcely extract additional key information from the reflections. This work makes the SCS protocol more practical. (c) 2025 Optica Publishing Group under the terms of the Optica Open Access Publishing Agreement

TI Fault-Tolerant Noise Guessing Decoding of Quantum Random Codes
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON QUANTUM ENGINEERING
AB This work addresses the open question of implementing fault-tolerant quantum random linear codes (QRLCs) with feasible computational overhead. We present a new decoder for QRLCs capable of dealing with imperfect decoding operations. A first approach, introduced by Cruz et al. (2023), only considered channel errors and perfect gates at the decoder. Here, we analyze the fault-tolerant characteristics of QRLCs with a new noise guessing decoding technique, when considering preparation, measurement, and gate errors in the syndrome extraction procedure, while also accounting for error degeneracy. Our findings indicate a threshold error rate (p(threshold)) of approximately 2x10(-5 )in the asymptotic limit, while considering realistic noise levels in the mentioned physical procedures.

TI Comparison of Discrete Variable and Continuous Variable Quantum Key
   Distribution Protocols with Phase Noise in the Thermal-Loss Channel
SO QUANTUM
AB Discrete-variable (DV) quantum key distribution (QKD) based on single -photon detectors and sources have been successfully deployed for long -range secure key distribution. On the other hand, continuous-variable (CV) quantum key distribution (QKD) based on coherent detectors and sources is currently lagging behind in terms of loss and noise tolerance. An important discerning factor between DV-QKD and CV-QKD is the effect of phase noise, which is known to be more relevant in CV-QKD. In this article, we investigate the effect of phase noise on DV-QKD and CV-QKD protocols, including the six-state protocol and squeezedstate protocol, in a thermal-loss channel but with the assumed availability of perfect sources and detectors. We find that in the low phase noise regime but high thermal noise regime, CV-QKD can tolerate more loss compared to DV-QKD. We also compare the secret key rate as an additional metric for the performance of QKD. Requirements for this quantity to be high vastly extend the regions at which CV-QKD performs better than DVQKD. Our analysis addresses the questions of how phase noise affects DV-QKD and CV-QKD and why the former has historically performed better in a thermal-loss channel.

TI Engineering superconducting qubits to reduce quasiparticles and charge
   noise
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Quasiparticles, or broken Cooper pairs, are a major source of decoherence in superconducting qubits but their origin is debated. Pan et al. confirm the dominant mechanism due to photon absorption in the Josephson junction and demonstrate mitigation strategies based on tuning of the qubit geometry.
   Identifying, quantifying, and suppressing decoherence mechanisms in qubits are important steps towards the goal of engineering a quantum computer or simulator. Superconducting circuits offer flexibility in qubit design; however, their performance is adversely affected by quasiparticles (broken Cooper pairs). Developing a quasiparticle mitigation strategy compatible with scalable, high-coherence devices is therefore highly desirable. Here we experimentally demonstrate how to control quasiparticle generation by downsizing the qubit, capping it with a metallic cover, and equipping it with suitable quasiparticle traps. Using a flip-chip design, we shape the electromagnetic environment of the qubit above the superconducting gap, inhibiting quasiparticle poisoning. Our findings support the hypothesis that quasiparticle generation is dominated by the breaking of Cooper pairs at the junction, as a result of photon absorption by the antenna-like qubit structure. We achieve record low charge-parity switching rate (<1 Hz). Our aluminium devices also display improved stability with respect to discrete charging events.

   Single-Qubit Sensor
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW APPLIED
AB Precise spectroscopy of oscillating fields plays a significant role in many fields. Here, we propose an experimentally feasible scheme to measure the frequency of a fast-oscillating field using a single-qubit sensor. By invoking a stable classical clock, the signal phase correlations between successive measurements enable us to extract the target frequency with extremely high precision. In addition, we integrate dynamical decoupling technique into the framework to suppress the influence of slow environmental noise. Our framework is feasible with a variety of atomic and single solid-state spin systems within the state-of-the-art experimental capabilities as a versatile tool for quantum spectroscopy.

TI Lightweight mediated semi-quantum key distribution protocol with a
   dishonest third party based on Bell states
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB The mediated semi-quantum key distribution (MSQKD) protocol is an important research issue that lets two classical participants share secret keys securely between each other with the help of a third party (TP). However, in the existing MSQKD protocols, there are two improvable issues, namely (1) the classical participants must be equipped with expensive detectors to avoid Trojan horse attacks and (2) the trustworthiness level of TP must be honest. To the best of our knowledge, none of the existing MSQKD protocols can resolve both these issues. Therefore, this study takes Bell states as the quantum resource to propose a MSQKD protocol, in which the classical participants do not need a Trojan horse detector and the TP is dishonest. Furthermore, the proposed protocol is shown to be secure against well-known attacks and the classical participants only need two quantum capabilities. Therefore, in comparison to the existing MSQKD protocols, the proposed protocol is better practical.

We adapt the algorithm from Kutin et al. that implements any n-qubit CNOT circuit in depth at most 5n on a Linear Nearest Neighbor architecture. Our proposal is a block version of Kutin et al.'s algorithm that is scalable with the number of interactions available in the hardware: the more interactions we have, the less the depth. We derive better theoretical upper bounds and provide a simple implementation of the algorithm. Overall, we achieve better depth complexity for CNOT circuits on some realistic quantum hardware like a grid or a ladder. For instance, the execution of an n-qubit CNOT circuit on a grid can be done in depth 4n + 8.

TI Strategies to search for two-dimensional materials with long spin qubit
   coherence time
SO NPJ 2D MATERIALS AND APPLICATIONS
AB Two-dimensional (2D) materials that can host qubits with long spin coherence time (T-2) have the distinct advantage of integrating easily with existing microelectronic and photonic platforms, making them attractive for designing novel quantum devices with enhanced performance. However, the relative lack of 2D materials as spin qubit hosts, as well as appropriate substrates that can help maintain long T-2, necessitates a strategy to search for candidates with robust spin coherence. Here, we develop a high-throughput computational workflow to predict the nuclear spin bath-driven qubit decoherence and T-2 in 2D materials and heterostructures. We initially screen 1172 2D materials and find 189 monolayers with T-2 > 1 ms, higher than that of naturally-abundant diamond. We then construct 1554 lattice-commensurate heterostructures between high-T-2 2D materials and select 3D substrates, and we find that T-2 is generally lower in a heterostructure than in the bare 2D host material; however, low-noise substrates (such as CeO2 and CaO) can help maintain high T-2. To further accelerate the material screening effort, we derive analytical models that enable rapid predictions of T-2 for 2D materials and heterostructures. The models offer a simple, yet quantitative, way to determine the relative contributions to decoherence from the nuclear spin baths of the 2D host and substrate in a heterostructural system. By developing a high-throughput workflow and analytical models, we expand the genome of 2D materials and their spin coherence times for the development of spin qubit platforms.

TI Entanglement Degradation in Two Interacting Qubits Coupled to Dephasing
   Environments
SO ENTROPY
AB One of the main obstacles toward building efficient quantum computing systems is decoherence, where the inevitable interaction between the qubits and the surrounding environment leads to a vanishing entanglement. We consider a system of two interacting asymmetric two-level atoms (qubits) in the presence of pure and correlated dephasing environments. We study the dynamics of entanglement while varying the interaction strength between the two qubits, their relative frequencies, and their coupling strength to the environment starting from different initial states of practical interest. The impact of the asymmetry of the two qubits, reflected in their different frequencies and coupling strengths to the environment, varies significantly depending on the initial state of the system and its degree of anisotropy. For an initial disentangled, or a Werner, state, as the difference between the frequencies increases, the entanglement decay rate increases, with more persistence at the higher degrees of anisotropy in the former state. However, for an initial anti-correlated Bell state, the entanglement decays more rapidly in the symmetric case compared with the asymmetric one. The difference in the coupling strengths of the two qubits to the pure (uncorrelated) dephasing environment leads to higher entanglement decay in the different initial state cases, though the rate varies depending on the degree of anisotropy and the initial state. Interestingly, the correlated dephasing environment, within a certain range, was found to enhance the entanglement dynamics starting from certain initial states, such as the disentangled, anti-correlated Bell, and Werner, whereas it exhibits a decaying effect in other cases such as the initial correlated Bell state.

TI Inserting Planar-Measured Qubits into MBQC Patterns while Preserving
   Flow
SO ELECTRONIC PROCEEDINGS IN THEORETICAL COMPUTER SCIENCE
CT 22nd International Conference on Quantum Physics and Logic (QPL)
CY JUL 14-18, 2025
CL Varna, BULGARIA
AB In the one-way model of measurement-based quantum computation (MBQC), computation proceeds via single-qubit measurements on a resource state. Flow conditions ensure that the overall computation is deterministic in a suitable sense, and are required for efficient translation into quantum circuits. Procedures that rewrite MBQC patterns-e.g. for optimisation, or adapting to hardware constraints-thus need to preserve the existence of flow. Most previous work has focused on rewrites that reduce the number of qubits in the computation, or that introduce new Pauli-measured qubits. Here, we consider the insertion of planar-measured qubits into MBQC patterns, i.e. arbitrary measurements in a plane of the Bloch sphere spanned by a pair of Pauli operators; such measurements are necessary for universal MBQC. We extend the definition of causal flow, previously restricted to XY-measurements only, to also permit YZ-measurements and derive the conditions under which a YZ-insertion preserves causal flow. Then we derive conditions for YZ-insertion into patterns with gflow or Pauli flow, in which case the argument straightforwardly extends to XZ-insertions as well. We also show that the 'vertex splitting' or 'neighbour unfusion' rule previously used in the literature can be derived from YZ-insertion and pivoting. This work contributes to understanding the broad properties of flow-preserving rewriting in MBQC and in the ZX-calculus more broadly, and it will enable more efficient optimisation, obfuscation, or routing.

TI Defending Against the Homodyne Detector-Blinding Attack on
   Continuous-Variable Quantum Key Distribution Using an Adjustable Optical
   Attenuator
SO ENTROPY
AB A homodyne detector, which is also a common element in current telecommunication, is a core component of continuous-variable quantum key distribution (CV-QKD) since it is considered the simplest setup for the distinguishing of coherent states with minimum error. However, the theoretical security of CV-QKD is based on the assumption that the responses of the homodyne detector are always linear with respect to the input, which is impossible in practice. In the real world, a homodyne detector has a finite linear domain, so the linearity assumption is broken when the input is too large. Regarding this security vulnerability, the eavesdropper Eve can perform the so-called homodyne detector-blinding attack by saturating the homodyne detector and then stealing key information without being detected by the legitimate users. In this paper, we propose a countermeasure for the homodyne detector-blinding attack by using an adjustable optical attenuator with a feedback structure. Specifically, we estimate the suitable attenuation value in the data processing of CV-QKD and feed it back to the adjustable optical attenuator before the detector in real time. Numerical simulation shows that the proposed countermeasure can effectively defend against homodyne detector-blinding attacks and ensure the security of the Gaussian-modulated coherent state protocol with finite-size effect.

TI Positivity and Nonadditivity of Quantum Capacities Using Generalized
   Erasure Channels
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INFORMATION THEORY
AB We consider various forms of a process, which we call gluing, for combining two or more complementary quantum channel pairs (B, C) to form a composite. One type of gluing combines a perfect channel with a second channel to produce a generalized erasure channel pair (B-g, C-g). We consider two cases in which the second channel is (i) an amplitude-damping, or (ii) a phase-damping qubit channel; (ii) is the dephrasure channel of Leditzky et al. For both (i) and (ii), (B-g, C-g) depends on the damping parameter 0 <= p <= 1 and a parameter 0 <= lambda <= 1 that characterizes the gluing process. In both cases we study Q((1)) (B-g) and Q((1)) (C-g), where Q((1)) is the channel coherent information, and determine the regions in the (p, lambda) plane where each is zero or positive, confirming previous results for (ii). A somewhat surprising result for which we lack any intuitive explanation is that Q((1)) (C-g) is zero for lambda <= 1/2 when p = 0, but is strictly positive (though perhaps extremely small) for all values of lambda > 0 when p is positive by even the smallest amount. In addition we study the nonadditivity of Q((1)) (B-g) for two identical channels in parallel. It occurs in a well-defined region of the (p, lambda) plane in case (i). In case (ii) we have extended previous results for the dephrasure channel without, however, identifying the full range of (p, lambda) values where nonadditivity occurs. Again, an intuitive explanation is lacking.

TI The SpinBus architecture for scaling spin qubits with electron shuttling
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Quantum processor architectures must enable scaling to large qubit numbers while providing two-dimensional qubit connectivity and exquisite operation fidelities. For microwave-controlled semiconductor spin qubits, dense arrays have made considerable progress, but are still limited in size by wiring fan-out and exhibit significant crosstalk between qubits. To overcome these limitations, we introduce the SpinBus architecture, which uses electron shuttling to connect qubits and features low operating frequencies and enhanced qubit coherence. Device simulations for all relevant operations in the Si/SiGe platform validate the feasibility with established semiconductor patterning technology and operation fidelities exceeding 99.9%. Control using room temperature instruments can plausibly support at least 144 qubits, but much larger numbers are conceivable with cryogenic control circuits. Building on the theoretical feasibility of high-fidelity spin-coherent electron shuttling as key enabling factor, the SpinBus architecture may be the basis for a spin-based quantum processor that meets the scalability requirements for practical quantum computing.
   Semiconductor qubit architectures based on direct qubit coupling suffer from wiring fan-out and crosstalk as they scale up. Here the authors propose an architecture based on conveyor-mode shuttling of electron spins that tackles these issues and validate it numerically on quantum dot spin qubits in Si/SiGe.

TI Classical analogue to driven quantum bits based on macroscopic pendula
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB Quantum mechanics increasingly penetrates modern technologies but, due to its non-deterministic nature seemingly contradicting our classical everyday world, our comprehension often stays elusive. Arguing along the correspondence principle, classical mechanics is often seen as a theory for large systems where quantum coherence is completely averaged out. Surprisingly, it is still possible to reconstruct the coherent dynamics of a quantum bit (qubit) by using a classical model system. This classical-to-quantum analogue is based on wave mechanics, which applies to both, the classical and the quantum world. In this spirit we investigate the dynamics of macroscopic physical pendula with a modulated coupling. As a proof of principle, we demonstrate full control of our one-to-one analogue to a qubit by realizing Rabi oscillations, Landau-Zener transitions and Landau-Zener-Stuckelberg-Majorana interferometry. Our classical qubit demonstrator can help comprehending and developing useful quantum technologies.

TI Quantum guidelines for solid-state spin defects
SO NATURE REVIEWS MATERIALS
AB Defects with associated electron and nuclear spins in solid-state materials have a long history relevant to quantum information science that goes back to the first spin echo experiments with silicon dopants in the 1950s. Since the turn of the century, the field has rapidly spread to a vast array of defects and host crystals applicable to quantum communication, sensing and computing. From simple spin resonance to long-distance remote entanglement, the complexity of working with spin defects is fast increasing, and requires an in-depth understanding of the defects' spin, optical, charge and material properties in this modern context. This is especially critical for discovering new relevant systems for specific quantum applications. In this Review, we expand upon all the key components of solid-state spin defects, with an emphasis on the properties of defects and of the host material, on engineering opportunities and on other pathways for improvement. This Review aims to be as defect and material agnostic as possible, with some emphasis on optical emitters, providing broad guidelines for the field of solid-state spin defects for quantum information.
   Defect-based spin qubits offer a versatile platform for creating solid-state quantum devices. This Review is a guide for understanding the properties and applications of current spin defects, and provides a framework for designing, engineering and discovering new qubit candidates

TI Leggett-Garg inequalities and temporal correlations for a qubit under
   PT-symmetric dynamics
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Macrorealistic description governing the classical realm is known to get uprooted in the quantum domain. The Leggett-Garg inequality [A. J. Leggett and A. Garg, Phys. Rev. Lett. 54, 857 (1985)] proposes to probe the macrorealistic limit emerging from the quantum scenario. It places a bound on the linear combinations of temporal correlations of observables measured sequentially at different time intervals. Violation of the Leggett-Garg inequality, up to the so-called temporal Tsirelson bound (TTB), has been realized in the quantum domain. It is important to understand whether quantum theory permits larger violation beyond the TTB and up to the algebraic maximum value of the Leggett-Garg inequality. To this end, it has been shown [C. Budroni and C. Emary, Phys. Rev. Lett. 113, 050401 (2014)] that a three-term Leggett-Garg inequality can be violated beyond the TTB 3/2 in the time evolution of N > 2 level quantum systems by choosing suitable measurement schemes and state-update rules. Furthermore, it is revealed that the algebraic maximum value 3 can be realized in the limit N -> infinity. Their measurement scheme rules out violation of the Leggett-Garg inequality beyond the TTB by a qubit. Being genuinely quantum in nature, we ask whether such enhanced violation of the Leggett-Garg inequality could be witnessed in a qubit itself. Here, we show that a qubit undergoing time evolution generated by a non-Hermitian PT-symmetric Hamiltonian indeed violates the three-term Leggett-Garg inequality beyond the TTB and up to its algebraic maximum value 3.

TI Enhanced coherence of all-nitride superconducting qubits epitaxially
   grown on silicon substrate
SO COMMUNICATIONS MATERIALS
AB Improving the coherence of superconducting qubits is a fundamental step towards the realization of fault-tolerant quantum computation. However, coherence times of quantum circuits made from conventional aluminum-based Josephson junctions are limited by the presence of microscopic two-level systems in the amorphous aluminum oxide tunnel barriers. Here, we have developed superconducting qubits based on NbN/AlN/NbN epitaxial Josephson junctions on silicon substrates which promise to overcome the drawbacks of qubits based on Al/AlOx/Al junctions. The all-nitride qubits have great advantages such as chemical stability against oxidation, resulting in fewer two-level fluctuators, feasibility for epitaxial tunnel barriers that reduce energy relaxation and dephasing, and a larger super-conducting gap of similar to 5.2 meV for NbN, compared to similar to 0.3 meV for aluminum, which suppresses the excitation of quasiparticles. By replacing conventional MgO by a silicon substrate with a TiN buffer layer for epitaxial growth of nitride junctions, we demonstrate a qubit energy relaxation time T-1 = 16.3 mu s and a spin-echo dephasing time T-2 = 21.5 mu s. These significant improvements in quantum coherence are explained by the reduced dielectric loss compared to the previously reported T-1 approximate to T-2 approximate to 0.5 mu s of NbN-based qubits on MgO substrates. These results are an important step towards constructing a new platform for superconducting quantum hardware.

TI Integrable Digital Quantum Simulation: Generalized Gibbs Ensembles and
   Trotter Transitions
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB The Trotter-Suzuki decomposition is a promising avenue for digital quantum simulation (DQS), approximating continuous-time dynamics by discrete Trotter steps of duration tau. Recent work suggested that DQS is typically characterized by a sharp Trotter transition: when tau is increased beyond a threshold value, approximation errors become uncontrolled at large times due to the onset of quantum chaos. Here, we contrast this picture with the case of integrable DQS. We focus on a simple quench from a spin-wave state in the prototypical XXZ Heisenberg spin chain, and study its integrable Trotterized evolution as a function of tau. Because of its exact local conservation laws, the system does not heat up to infinite temperature and the late-time properties of the dynamics are captured by a discrete generalized Gibbs ensemble (dGGE). By means of exact calculations we find that, for small tau, the dGGE depends analytically on the Trotter step, implying that discretization errors remain bounded even at infinite times. Conversely, the dGGE changes abruptly at a threshold value tau(th), signaling a novel type of Trotter transition. We show that the latter can be detected locally, as it is associated with the appearance of a nonzero staggered magnetization with a subtle dependence on tau. We highlight the differences between continuous and discrete GGEs, suggesting the latter as novel interesting nonequilibrium states exclusive to digital platforms.

TI Enhancing quantum coherence of a fluxonium qubit by employing flux
   modulation with tunable-complex-amplitude
SO NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB We propose to protect fluxonium qubits that are away from half flux quantum againstenvironmental noises, especially1/fflux noise, by adopting a modulated flux withtunable-complex-amplitude. Using open-system Floquet theory, we derive a Lindblad equationand extract decoherent rates for pure-dephasing, excitation and relaxation. After examiningintrinsic attributes of the flux driven fluxonium qubit, we put forward an analytic manner to locatedynamical sweet spots for fast and weak driving. Continuous families of dynamical sweet spots arefound in the parameter plane of relative amplitude factor and relative phase. Around a family ofdynamical sweet spots or between two families of dynamical sweet spots, there exist continuousregions with long coherent times that exceed100 mu s. Taking advantage of the two noise-insensitivechannels: relative amplitude factor and relative phase, a flux driven fluxonium qubit can becomeimmune to flux noises from both the dc and ac flux amplitudes. And the optimal drivingamplitudes are no longer isolated at a certain driving frequency, but become continuous. This is insharp contrast to the usual schemes based on flux modulation with real-amplitude. As a result,there are plenty of manipulating flexibility in our flux driving scheme withtunable-complex-amplitude, which may be useful in logical operations among flux drivenfluxonium qubits or other flux qubits

TI Detection of biological signals from a live mammalian muscle using an
   early stage diamond quantum sensor
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB The ability to perform noninvasive and non-contact measurements of electric signals produced by action potentials is essential in biomedicine. A key method to do this is to remotely sense signals by the magnetic field they induce. Existing methods for magnetic field sensing of mammalian tissue, used in techniques such as magnetoencephalography of the brain, require cryogenically cooled superconducting detectors. These have many disadvantages in terms of high cost, flexibility and limited portability as well as poor spatial and temporal resolution. In this work we demonstrate an alternative technique for detecting magnetic fields generated by the current from action potentials in living tissue using nitrogen vacancy centres in diamond. With 50 pT/root Hz sensitivity, we show the first measurements of magnetic sensing from mammalian tissue with a diamond sensor using mouse muscle optogenetically activated with blue light. We show these proof of principle measurements can be performed in an ordinary, unshielded lab environment and that the signal can be easily recovered by digital signal processing techniques. Although as yet uncompetitive with probe electrophysiology in terms of sensitivity, we demonstrate the feasibility of sensing action potentials via magnetic field in mammals using a diamond quantum sensor, as a step towards microscopic imaging of electrical activity in a biological sample using nitrogen vacancy centres in diamond.

TI Two-qubit non-locality interacting time-dependently with a parametric
   amplifier cavity with Stark-shift nonlinearity
SO ALEXANDRIA ENGINEERING JOURNAL
AB We have explored the non-locality of two qubits interacting time-dependently with a nondegenerate parametric amplifier cavity fields in the presence of the Stark shift interaction term. The time-dependent two-qubit reduced density matrix is calculated numerically when the cavity fields are initially in two entangled coherent states. We investigate the non-locality via local Fisher information and negativity. It is shown that, the generated non-locality depends on the time dependent two-qubit location, the Stark shift interaction, the difference between the mean photon numbers of the two cavity fields as well as the initial intensity coherent fields. The agreement of the generated correlations presented by the local Fisher information and the negativity depends on the physical parameters. The Stark shift non-linearity and the difference between the mean photon numbers leads to reducing the generated correlations. The local Fisher information is more robust against the Stark shift interaction than the negativity. (C) 2021 THE AUTHORS.

TI Enhancing entanglement and total correlation dynamics via local
   unitaries
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB The interaction with the environment is one of the main obstacles to be circumvented in practical implementations of quantum information tasks. The use of local unitaries, while not changing the initial entanglement present in a given state, can enormously change its dynamics through a noisy channel, and consequently its ability to be used as a resource. In this way, local unitaries provide an easy and accessible way to enhance quantum correlations in a variety of different experimental platforms. Given an initial entangled state and a certain noisy channel, what are the local unitaries providing the most robust dynamics? In this paper we solve this question considering two-qubit states, together with paradigmatic and relevant noisy channels, showing its consequences for teleportation protocols and identifying cases where the most robust states are not necessarily the ones imprinting the least information about themselves into the environment. We also derive a general multipartite law relating the interplay between the total correlations in the system and environment with their mutual information built up over the noisy dynamics. Finally, we employ the IBM Quantum Experience to provide a proof-of-principle experimental implementation of our results.

TI Quantum causal inference in the presence of hidden common causes: An
   entropic approach
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Quantum causality is an emerging field of study which has the potential to greatly advance our understanding of quantum systems. In this paper, we put forth a theoretical framework for merging quantum information science and causal inference by exploiting entropic principles. For this purpose, we leverage the tradeoff between the entropy of hidden cause and the conditional mutual information of observed variables to develop a scalable algorithmic approach for inferring causality in the presence of latent confounders (common causes) in quantum systems. As an application, we consider a system of three entangled qubits and transmit the second and third qubits over separate noisy quantum channels. In this model, we validate that the first qubit is a latent confounder and the common cause of the second and third qubits. In contrast, when two entangled qubits are prepared and one of them is sent over a noisy channel, there is no common confounder. We also demonstrate that the proposed approach outperforms the results of classical causal inference for the Tubingen database when the variables are classical by exploiting quantum dependence between variables through density matrices rather than joint probability distributions. Thus, the proposed approach unifies classical and quantum causal inference in a principled way.

TI Bose-Einstein condensate soliton qubit states for metrological
   applications
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB We propose a novel platform for quantum metrology based on qubit states of two Bose-Einstein condensate solitons, optically manipulated, trapped in a double-well potential, and coupled through nonlinear Josephson effect. We describe steady-state solutions in different scenarios and perform a phase space analysis in the terms of population imbalance-phase difference variables to demonstrate macroscopic quantum self-trapping regimes. Schrodinger-cat states, maximally path-entangled (N00N) states, and macroscopic soliton qubits are predicted and exploited to distinguish the obtained macroscopic states in the framework of binary (non-orthogonal) state discrimination problem. For an arbitrary frequency estimation we have revealed these macroscopic soliton states have a scaling up to the Heisenberg and super-Heisenberg (SH) limits within linear and nonlinear metrology procedures, respectively. The examples and numerical evaluations illustrate experimental feasibility of estimation with SH accuracy of angular frequency between the ground and first excited macroscopic states of the condensate in the presence of moderate losses, which opens new perspectives for current frequency standard technologies.

TI Spin-optomechanical cavity interfaces by deep subwavelength
   phonon-photon confinement
SO NPJ QUANTUM INFORMATION
AB A central goal of quantum information science is transferring qubits between space, time, and modality. Spin-based systems in solids are promising quantum memories, but high-fidelity transfer of their quantum states to telecom optical fields remains challenging. Here, we introduce a phonon-mediated interface between spins in a diamond nanobeam optomechanical crystal and telecom optical fields by a simultaneous deep-subwavelength confinement of optical and acoustic fields with mode volumes V-mech/Lambda(3)(p)similar to 10(-5) and V-opt/lambda(3) similar to 10(-3), respectively. This confinement boosts the spin-mechanical coupling rate of Group-IV silicon vacancy (SiV-) centers by an order of magnitude to similar to 32 MHz while retaining high acousto-optical couplings. The optical cavity couples to the spin irrespective of the emitter's native excited states, avoiding spectral diffusion. Using Quantum Monte Carlo simulations, we estimate heralded entanglement fidelities exceeding 0.96 between two such interfaces. We anticipate broad utility beyond diamond emitter-telecom systems to most solid-state quantum memories.

TI Microscopic treatment of instantaneous spectral diffusion and its effect
   on quantum gate fidelities in rare-earth-ion-doped crystals
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB The effect of instantaneous spectral diffusion (ISD) on gate operations in rare-earth-ion-doped crystals is an important question to answer for the future of rare-earth quantum computing. Here we present a microscopic modeling that highlights the stochastic nature of the phenomenon and use it to investigate ISD errors on singlequbit gate operations. Furthermore, we present a method to estimate the total error from many different error sources by only studying subsystems containing one error source at a time. This allows us to estimate the total ISD error from all nonqubit dopants in the vicinity of a qubit. We conclude that optical pumping techniques must be used to empty the frequency regions around the qubit transitions from absorption (transmission windows) in order to suppress the ISD errors. Despite using such windows, there remains a roughly 0.3% risk that a qubit has an ISD error larger than the error from other sources. In those cases, the qubit can be discarded and its frequency channel can be reused by another qubit. However, in most cases the ISD errors are significantly smaller than other errors, thus opening up the possibility to perform noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) algorithms despite ISD being present.

TI Adaptive measurement strategy for quantum subspace methods
SO NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB Estimation of physical observables for unknown quantum states is an important problem that underlies a wide range of fields, including quantum information processing, quantum physics, and quantum chemistry. In the context of quantum computation, in particular, existing studies have mainly focused on holistic state tomography or estimation on specific observables with known classical descriptions, while this lacks the important class of problems where the estimation target itself relies on the measurement outcome. In this work, we propose an adaptive measurement optimization method that is useful for the quantum subspace methods, namely the variational simulation methods that utilize classical postprocessing on measurement outcomes. The proposed method first determines the measurement protocol for classically simulatable states, and then adaptively updates the protocol of quantum subspace expansion (QSE) according to the quantum measurement result. As a numerical demonstration, we have shown for excited-state simulation of molecules that (i) we are able to reduce the number of measurements by an order of magnitude by constructing an appropriate measurement strategy (ii) the adaptive iteration converges successfully even for a strongly correlated molecule of H4. Our work reveals that the potential of the QSE method can be empowered by elaborated measurement protocols, and opens a path to further pursue efficient quantum measurement techniques in practical computations.

TI Quantum Pattern Classification in a Three-Qubit System
SO SYMMETRY-BASEL
AB The problem of pattern classification in quantum data has been of great importance over the past few years. This study investigates the effect of deploying Grover's, the partial diffusion, and the fixed-phase algorithms separately to amplify the amplitudes of a desired pattern in an unstructured dataset. These quantum search operators were applied to symmetric and antisymmetric input superpositions on a three-qubit system for 20 iterations each. After each iteration, different probabilities of classification were calculated in order to determine the accuracy of classification for each of the three quantum search operators. The results indicated that, in the case of applying the three quantum search operators to incomplete superposition input states, the partial diffusion operator outperformed the other operators with a probability of correct classification that reached 100% in certain iterations. It also showed that the classification accuracy of the fixed-phase operator exceeded the accuracy of the other two operators by 40% in most cases when the input state was a uniform superposition, and some of the basis states were phase-inverted.

TI Universal Decoding of Quantum Stabilizer Codes via Classical Guesswork
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB A universal decoding scheme is conceived for quantum stabilizer codes (QSCs) by appropriately adapting the 'guessing random additive noise decoding' (GRAND) philosophy of classical domain codes. We demonstrate that the generalized quantum decoder conceived is eminently suitable for different QSC decoding paradigms, namely for both stabilizer-measurement-based as well as the inverse-encoder-based decoding. We then harness the resultant decoder for both quantum Bose-Chaudhuri-Hocquenghem (BCH) codes and quantum polar codes and quantify both their quantum block error rate (QBLER), and QBLER per logical qubits as well as their decoding complexity. Furthermore, we provide a parametric study of the associated design trade-offs and offer design guideline for the implementation of GRAND-based QSC decoders.

TI Quantum Keyless Private Communication Versus Quantum Key Distribution
   for Space Links
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW APPLIED
AB We study information-theoretical security for space links between a satellite and a ground station. Quantum key distribution (QKD) is a well-established method for information-theoretical secure communication, giving the eavesdropper unlimited access to the channel and technological resources limited by only the laws of quantum physics. But QKD for space links is extremely challenging, the achieved key rates are extremely low, and daytime operating impossible. However, eavesdropping on a channel in free space without being noticed seems complicated, given the constraints imposed by orbital mechanics. If we also exclude the eavesdropper's presence in a given area around the emitter and receiver, we can guarantee that he has access to only a fraction of the optical signal. In this setting, quantum keyless private (direct) communication based on the wiretap channel model is a valid alternative to provide information-theoretical security. Like for QKD, we assume that the legitimate users are limited by state-ofthe-art technology, while the potential eavesdropper is only limited by physical laws: either by specifying her detection strategy (Helstrom detector) or by bounding her knowledge, assuming the most powerful strategy through the Holevo information. Nevertheless, we demonstrate information-theoretical secure communication rates (positive keyless private capacity) over a classical-quantum wiretap channel using on-off keying of coherent states. We present numerical results for a setting equivalent to the recent experiments with the Micius satellite and compare them to the fundamental limit for the secret key rate of QKD. We obtain much higher rates compared with QKD with an exclusion area of less than 13 m for low earth orbit satellites. Moreover, we show that the wiretap channel quantum keyless privacy is much less sensitive to noise and signal dynamics and daytime operation is possible.

TI Optimizing Quantum Classification Algorithms on Classical Benchmark
   Datasets
SO ENTROPY
AB The discovery of quantum algorithms offering provable advantages over the best known classical alternatives, together with the parallel ongoing revolution brought about by classical artificial intelligence, motivates a search for applications of quantum information processing methods to machine learning. Among several proposals in this domain, quantum kernel methods have emerged as particularly promising candidates. However, while some rigorous speedups on certain highly specific problems have been formally proven, only empirical proof-of-principle results have been reported so far for real-world datasets. Moreover, no systematic procedure is known, in general, to fine tune and optimize the performances of kernel-based quantum classification algorithms. At the same time, certain limitations such as kernel concentration effects-hindering the trainability of quantum classifiers-have also been recently pointed out. In this work, we propose several general-purpose optimization methods and best practices designed to enhance the practical usefulness of fidelity-based quantum classification algorithms. Specifically, we first describe a data pre-processing strategy that, by preserving the relevant relationships between data points when processed through quantum feature maps, substantially alleviates the effect of kernel concentration on structured datasets. We also introduce a classical post-processing method that, based on standard fidelity measures estimated on a quantum processor, yields non-linear decision boundaries in the feature Hilbert space, thus achieving the quantum counterpart of the radial basis functions technique that is widely employed in classical kernel methods. Finally, we apply the so-called quantum metric learning protocol to engineer and adjust trainable quantum embeddings, demonstrating substantial performance improvements on several paradigmatic real-world classification tasks.

   UNIVERSITETA-SERIYA-FIZIKO-MATEMATICHESKIYE NAUKI
AB In this article, we consider the dynamics of three identical qubits interacting not-resonantly with a thermal field of an ideal resonator with a Kerr medium. We have found the solutions of the Liouville quantum equation for the total density matrix of a system under consideration for the initial separable, biseparable, and genuine entangled states of the qubits and the thermal initial state of the resonator field. By averaging the total density matrix over the variables of the resonator field and the variables of one of the qubits, we found the reduced density matrix of the pair of remaining qubits. Two-qubit density matrices were used to calculate the qubit-qubit negativity. The results showed that detuning and Kerr nonlinearity can greatly enhance the amout of entanglement for initial separable state of a pair of qubits. It is also shown that detuning and a Kerr medium can inhibit the sudden death of entanglement.

TI Generating scalable graph states in an atom-nanophotonic interface
SO QUANTUM SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB Scalable graph states are essential for measurement-based quantum computation and many entanglement-assisted applications in quantum technologies. Generation of these multipartite entangled states requires a controllable and efficient quantum device with delicate design of generation protocol. Here we propose to prepare high-fidelity and scalable graph states in one and two dimensions, which can be tailored in an atom-nanophotonic cavity via state carving technique. We propose a systematic protocol to carve out unwanted state components, which facilitates scalable graph states generations via adiabatic transport of a definite number of atoms in optical tweezers. An analysis of state fidelity is also presented, and the state preparation probability can be optimized via multiqubit state carvings and sequential single-photon probes. Our results showcase the capability of an atom-nanophotonic interface for creating graph states and pave the way toward novel problem-specific applications using scalable high-dimensional graph states with stationary qubits.

TI RuntimeCoherence Tradeoffs for Hybrid Satisfiability Solvers
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON QUANTUM ENGINEERING
AB Many search-based quantum algorithms that achieve a theoretical speedup are not practically relevant since they require extraordinarily long coherence times, or lack the parallelizability of their classical counterparts. This raises the question of how to divide computational tasks into a collection of parallelizable subproblems, each of which can be solved by a quantum computer with limited coherence time. Here, we approach this question via hybrid algorithms for the k-satisfiability problem (k-SAT). Our analysis is based on Schoning's algorithm, which solves instances of k-SAT by performing random walks in the space of potential assignments. The search space of the walk allows for "natural" partitions, where we subject only one part of the partition to a Grover search, while the rest is sampled classically, thus resulting in a hybrid scheme. In this setting, we argue that there exists a simple tradeoff relation between the total runtime and the coherence time, which no such partition-based hybrid scheme can surpass. For several concrete choices of partitions, we explicitly determine the specific runtime coherence time relations and show saturation of the ideal tradeoff. Finally, we present numerical simulations, which suggest additional flexibility in implementing hybrid algorithms with the optimal tradeoff.

TI Trojan-horse attack on a real-world quantum key distribution system:
   Theoretical and experimental security analysis
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW APPLIED
AB This paper presents a theoretical and experimental demonstration of a security analysis of a Trojanhorse attack (THA) on a real-world quantum key distribution (QKD) system. We show that the upper bound on the information leakage depends solely on the fidelity between the states of the adversary. We find the lower bound for fidelity between THA states in both the polarization- and phase-coding BB84 protocols, considering both pure and mixed states. Our bounds depend only on the mean photon number per pulse available to an adversary. We also present an experimental analysis of a QKD system, including optical time-domain reflectometry measurements with centimeter resolution and spectral transmittance measurements for optical defense elements ranging from 1100 to 1800 nm with a noise floor lower than -100 dB. Finally, by considering the optimal attack, we obtain the value of the mean photon number per pulse available to an adversary and calculate the key leakage that needs to be eliminated during the privacy amplification procedure.

TI A p-Adic Model of Quantum States and the p-Adic Qubit
SO ENTROPY
AB We propose a model of a quantum N-dimensional system (quNit) based on a quadratic extension of the non-Archimedean field of p-adic numbers. As in the standard complex setting, states and observables of a p-adic quantum system are implemented by suitable linear operators in a p-adic Hilbert space. In particular, owing to the distinguishing features of p-adic probability theory, the states of an N-dimensional p-adic quantum system are implemented by p-adic statistical operators, i.e., trace-one selfadjoint operators in the carrier Hilbert space. Accordingly, we introduce the notion of selfadjoint-operator-valued measure (SOVM)-a suitable p-adic counterpart of a POVM in a complex Hilbert space-as a convenient mathematical tool describing the physical observables of a p-adic quantum system. Eventually, we focus on the special case where N=2, thus providing a description of p-adic qubit states and 2-dimensional SOVMs. The analogies-but also the non-trivial differences-with respect to the qubit states of standard quantum mechanics are then analyzed.

TI Non-locality and entanglement in multi-qubit systems from a unified
   framework
SO QUANTUM INFORMATION PROCESSING
AB Non-classical probability is the underlying feature of quantum mechanics. The emergence of Bell-CHSH non-locality [We stress that CHSH inequality (Clauser et al. in Phys. Rev. Lett. 23(15):880, 1969) is more general and reduces to Bell inequality (Bell in Physics 1:195, 1964) under the assumption of perfect correlations between the observables] for bipartite systems and linear entanglement inequalities for two-qubit systems has been shown in Adhikary et al. (Eur Phys J D 74:68, 2020), purely as violations of classical probability rules. In this paper, we improve upon that work by showing that violation of any nonlocality inequality implies violation of classical probability rules, manifested through negative probabilities, without recourse to any underlying theory. Moving on to entanglement, we employ parent pseudoprojections to show how any number of linear and nonlinear entanglement witnesses for multiqubit systems can be obtained as violations of classical probability rules. They include the ones that have been derived earlier by employing different methods. It provides a perspective complementary to the current understanding in terms of the algebraic approaches.

TI Computation in a general physical setting
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICS A-MATHEMATICAL AND THEORETICAL
AB The computational abilities of theories within the generalised probabilistic theory framework has been the subject of much recent study. Such investigations aim to gain an understanding of the possible connections between physical principles and computation. Moreover, comparing and contrasting the computational properties of quantum theory with other operationally-sensible theories could shed light on the strengths and limitations of quantum computation. This paper reviews and extends some of these results, deriving new bounds on the computational ability of theories satisfying n-local tomography, and theories in which states are represented as generalised superpositions. It moreover provides a refined version of the conjecture that a quantum computer can simulate the computation in any theory within a certain sub-class of generalised probabilistic theories with at most polynomial overhead. The paper ends by describing an important relation between this conjecture and delegated computation, similar to the relation between quantum non-locality and device-independent cryptography.

TI Data-driven quantum dynamical embedding method for long-term prediction
   on near-term quantum computers
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB The increasing focus on long-term time series prediction across various fields has been significantly strengthened by advancements in quantum computation. In this paper we introduce a data-driven method designed for time series prediction with quantum dynamical embedding (QDE). This approach enables a trainable embedding of the data space into an extended state space, allowing for the recursive retrieval of time series information. Based on its independence of time series length, this method achieves depth-efficient quantum circuits that are crucial for near-term quantum computers. Numerical simulations demonstrate the model's capability to predict not only wave signals but also more complex signals such as NARMA. Prediction accuracy improves with model scaling, and notably, the model achieves better accuracy on wave signal tasks with fewer parameters compared to QRC. Additionally, the model shows promising potential for denoising classical noise in wave signals, and when combined with error mitigation techniques for typical quantum noise, it enables reliable long-term prediction of wave signals. We implement this model, restricted to two qubits, on the Origin "Wukong" superconducting quantum processor as a simple proof of concept on NISQ devices. Furthermore, we provide theoretical analysis of the QDE's dynamical properties for the two-qubit case and discuss its potential universality. Overall, this study represents our first step towards leveraging near-term quantum devices for time series forecasting, offering insights into integrating data-driven learning with quantum dynamical embeddings.

TI Photon and phonon statistics in a qubit-plasmon-phonon
   ultrastrong-coupling system
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB We study the photon and phonon statistics of a qubit-plasmon-phonon hybrid system in the ultrastrongcoupling regime. The introduced qubit coupling causes parity-conserving and -nonconserving situations. We employ an analytic approximation approach for the parity-conserving case to reveal the statistical behaviors of photons and phonons. It indicates that both photons and phonons show strong antibunching at the same frequency. Even though the bunching properties of photons and phonons occupy the dominant regions of the considered frequencies, phonons tend to weak antibunching within the photonic strong-bunching area. In contrast, one can find that the configurations of correlation functions for both photons and phonons in the parity-conserving case are squeezed towards the central frequency by parity breaking, which directly triggers the reverse statistical behaviors of the different parties in the low-frequency regions and the strong-bunching properties in other frequency regions. The photon-phonon cross-correlation function also demonstrates similar parity-induced differences, indicating that the nonconserving parity induces the photon-phonon bunching behavior. We finally analyze the delayed second-order correlation function with different driving frequencies, which illustrates striking oscillations revealing the occurrence of simultaneous multiple excitations.

TI Vibronic Relaxation Pathways in Molecular Spin Qubit
   Na9[Ho(W5O18)2]•35H2</s
   ub>O under Pressure
SO MAGNETOCHEMISTRY
AB In order to explore how spectral sparsity and vibronic decoherence pathways can be controlled in a model qubit system with atomic clock transitions, we combined diamond anvil cell techniques with synchrotron-based far infrared spectroscopy and first-principles calculations to reveal the vibrational response of Na-9[Ho(W5O18)(2)]middot35H(2)O under compression. Because the hole in the phonon density of states acts to reduce the overlap between the phonons and f manifold excitations in this system, we postulated that pressure might move the HoO4 rocking, bending, and asymmetric stretching modes that couple with the M-J = +/- 5, +/- 2, and +/- 7 levels out of resonance, reducing their interactions and minimizing decoherence processes, while a potentially beneficial strategy for some molecular qubits, pressure slightly hardens the phonons in Na-9[Ho(W5O18)(2)]middot35H(2)O and systematically fills in the transparency window in the phonon response. The net result is that the vibrational spectrum becomes less sparse and the overlap with the various MJ levels of the Ho3+ ion actually increases. These findings suggest that negative pressure, achieved using chemical means or elongational strain, could further open the transparency window in this rare earth-containing spin qubit system, thus paving the way for the use of device surfaces and interface elongational/compressive strains to better manage decoherence pathways.

SO APPLIED PHYSICS LETTERS
AB Silicon-germanium (SiGe) is a material that possesses a multitude of applications ranging from transistors to electro-optical modulators and quantum dots. The diverse properties of SiGe also make it attractive to implementations involving superconducting quantum computing. Here, we demonstrate the fabrication of transmon quantum bits on SiGe layers and investigate the microwave loss properties of SiGe at cryogenic temperatures and single photon microwave powers. We find relaxation times of up to 100 mu s, corresponding to a quality factor Q above 4 M for large pad transmons. The high Q values obtained indicate that the SiGe/Si heterostructure is compatible with state-of-the-art performance of superconducting quantum circuits.

TI Convolutional Neural Decoder for Surface Codes
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON QUANTUM ENGINEERING
AB To perform reliable information processing in quantum computers, quantum error correction (QEC) codes are essential for the detection and correction of errors in the qubits. Among QEC codes, topological QEC codes are designed to interact between the neighboring qubits, which is a promising property for easing the implementation requirements. In addition, the locality to the qubits provides unusual tolerance to local errors. Recently, various decoding algorithms based on machine learning have been proposed to improve the decoding performance and latency of QEC codes. In this work, we propose a new decoding algorithm for surface codes, i.e., a type of topological codes, by using convolutional neural networks (CNNs) tailored for the topological lattice structure of the surface codes. In particular, the proposed algorithm takes advantage of the syndrome pattern, which is represented as a part of a rectangular lattice given to the CNN as its input. The remaining part of the rectangular lattice is filled with a carefully selected incoherent value for better logical error rate performance. In addition, we introduce how to optimize the hyperparameters in the CNN, according to the lattice structure of a given surface code. This reduces the overall decoding complexity and makes the CNN-based decoder computationally more suitable for implementation. The numerical results show that the proposed decoding algorithm effectively improves the decoding performance in terms of logical error rate as compared to the existing algorithms on various quantum error models.

TI Contrastive Learning Pre-Training and Quantum Theory for Cross-Lingual
   Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis
SO ENTROPY
AB The cross-lingual aspect-based sentiment analysis (ABSA) task continues to pose a significant challenge, as it involves training a classifier on high-resource source languages and then applying it to classify texts in low-resource target languages, thereby bridging linguistic gaps while preserving accuracy. Most existing methods achieve exceptional performance by relying on multilingual pre-trained language models (mPLM) and translation systems to transfer knowledge across languages. However, little attention has been paid to factors beyond semantic similarity, which ultimately hinders classification performance in target languages. To address this challenge, we propose CLQT, a novel framework that combines contrastive learning pre-training with quantum theory to address the cross-lingual ABSA task. Firstly, we develop a contrastive learning strategy to align data between the source and target languages. Subsequently, we incorporate a quantum network that employs quantum projection and quantum entanglement to facilitate effective knowledge transfer across languages. Extensive experiments reveal that the novel CLQT framework both achieves strong results and has a beneficial overall influence on the cross-lingual ABSA task.

TI Quantifying Quantum Speedups: Improved Classical Simulation From Tighter
   Magic Monotones
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB Consumption of magic states promotes the stabilizer model of computation to universal quantum computation. Here, we propose three different classical algorithms for simulating such universal quantum circuits, and characterize them by establishing precise connections with a family of magic monotones. Our first simulator introduces a new class of quasiprobability distributions and connects its runtime to a generalized notion of negativity. We prove that this algorithm has significantly improved exponential scaling compared to all prior quasiprobability simulators for qubits. Our second simulator is a new variant of the stabilizer-rank simulation algorithm, extended to work with mixed states and with significantly improved runtime bounds. Our third simulator trades precision for speed by discarding negative quasiprobabilities. We connect each algorithm's performance to a corresponding magic monotone and, by comprehensively characterizing the monotones, we obtain a precise understanding of the simulation runtime and error bounds. Our analysis reveals a deep connection between all three seemingly unrelated simulation techniques and their associated monotones. For tensor products of single-qubit states, we prove that our monotones are all equal to each other, multiplicative and efficiently computable, allowing us to make clear-cut comparisons of the simulators' performance scaling. Furthermore, our monotones establish several asymptotic and nonasymptotic bounds on state interconversion and distillation rates. Beyond the theory of magic states, our classical simulators can be adapted to other resource theories under certain axioms, which we demonstrate through an explicit application to the theory of quantum coherence.

TI Minimization of information leakage in continuous-variable quantum key
   distribution
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB A communication protocol based on a Gaussian modulation of squeezed states in a single quadrature and measured via homodyne detection can completely eliminate information leakage to an eavesdropper in a pureloss channel. However, the asymmetry of the protocol with respect to the quadratures of light presents security issues and the eavesdropper's information is not necessarily minimized for general asymmetric attacks. Here, we perform asymptotic security analysis of the asymmetric protocol against general asymmetric collective attacks and bound the eavesdropper's information via the Heisenberg uncertainty principle. The bound is not tight, and therefore we symmetrize the protocol in a heralding way, discarding the issues of asymmetry altogether. Our proposed heralding protocol asymptotically eliminates information leakage in a pure-loss channel and minimizes leakage in a noisy channel.

TI Simulation of Kitaev chain using one-dimensional chain of
   superconducting qubits and environmental effects on topological states
SO JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYSICS
AB Kitaev chain is one of the important physical models for studying topological quantum states and quantum computing. We here propose an approach to simulate the one-dimensional Kitaev chain via a circuit of superconducting qubits. In our approach, all coupling parameters can be controlled independently, and a nontrivial gauge phase is constructed. We also study the environmental effects on the topological states of the Kitaev chain. In addition to the independent environment surrounding each qubit, we consider the common environment shared by neighboring qubits. Such an environment can generate effective non-Hermitian dissipative coupling between qubits. Through analysis and numerical calculation, we demonstrate that the common environment can significantly affect the topological properties of the qubit chain. Moreover, we observe that dissipative couplings at the edges of the Kitaev chain affect the topological states more strongly than those located elsewhere. Our work may provide a new way to explore topological phase transitions and environmental effects on topological physics using superconducting qubit circuits.

TI Intrinsic quantum correlations for Gaussian localized Dirac cat states
   in phase space
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Following the information-based approach to Dirac spinors under a constant magnetic field, the phase-space representation of symmetric and antisymmetric localized Dirac cat states is obtained. The intrinsic entanglement profile implied by the Dirac Hamiltonian is then investigated so as to shed a light on quantum states as carriers of qubits correlated by phase-space variables. Corresponding to the superposition of Gaussian states, cat states exhibit nontrivial elementary information dynamics which include the interplay between intrinsic entanglement and quantum superposition as reported by the corresponding Dirac archetypes. Despite the involved time evolution as nonstationary states, the Wigner function constrains the elementary information quantifiers according to a robust framework which can be consistently used for quantifying the time-dependent SU(2) (R) SU(2) (spin projection and intrinsic parity) correlation profile of phase-space localized Dirac spinor states. Our results show that the Dirac Wigner functions for cat states-described in terms of generalized Laguerre polynomials-exhibit an almost maximized timely persistent mutual information profile which is engendered by either classical- or quantumlike spin-parity correlations, depending on the magnetic field intensity.

TI Quantum Noise Sensing by Generating Fake Noise
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW APPLIED
AB Noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices are nowadays starting to become available to the final user, hence potentially allowing the quantum speedups predicted by quantum-information theory to be shown. However, before implementing any quantum algorithm, it is crucial to have at least a partial or possibly full knowledge on the type and amount of noise affecting the quantum machine. Here, by generalizing quantum generative adversarial learning from quantum states (QGANs) to quantum operations, superoperators, and channels (here named super QGANs), we propose a very promising framework to characterize noise in a realistic quantum device, even in the case of spatially and temporally correlated noise (memory channels) affecting quantum circuits. The key idea is to learn about the noise by mimicking it in a way that one cannot distinguish between the real (to be sensed) and the fake (generated) one. We find that, when applied to the benchmarking case of Pauli channels, the super-QGAN protocol is able to learn the associated error rates even in the case of spatially and temporally correlated noise. Moreover, we also show how to employ it for quantum metrology applications. We believe our super QGANs pave the way for the development of hybrid quantum-classical machine-learning protocols for a better characterization and control of the current and future unavoidably noisy quantum devices.

TI Quantum-Inspired Differential Evolution with Grey Wolf Optimizer for 0-1
   Knapsack Problem
SO MATHEMATICS
AB The knapsack problem is one of the most widely researched NP-complete combinatorial optimization problems and has numerous practical applications. This paper proposes a quantum-inspired differential evolution algorithm with grey wolf optimizer (QDGWO) to enhance the diversity and convergence performance and improve the performance in high-dimensional cases for 0-1 knapsack problems. The proposed algorithm adopts quantum computing principles such as quantum superposition states and quantum gates. It also uses adaptive mutation operations of differential evolution, crossover operations of differential evolution, and quantum observation to generate new solutions as trial individuals. Selection operations are used to determine the better solutions between the stored individuals and the trial individuals created by mutation and crossover operations. In the event that the trial individuals are worse than the current individuals, the adaptive grey wolf optimizer and quantum rotation gate are used to preserve the diversity of the population as well as speed up the search for the global optimal solution. The experimental results for 0-1 knapsack problems confirm the advantages of QDGWO with the effectiveness and global search capability for knapsack problems, especially for high-dimensional situations.

TI The impact of cost function globality and locality in hybrid quantum
   neural networks on NISQ devices
SO MACHINE LEARNING-SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB Quantum neural networks (QNNs) are often challenged with the problem of flat cost function landscapes during training, known as barren plateaus (BP). A solution to potentially overcome the problem of the BP has recently been proposed by Cerezo et al In this solution, it is shown that, for an arbitrary deep quantum layer(s) in QNNs, a global cost function (all qubits measured in an n-qubit system) will always experience BP, whereas a local cost function (single qubit measured in an n-qubit system) can help to alleviate the problem of BP to a certain depth (O (log(n))). In this paper, we empirically analyze the locality and globality of the cost function in hybrid quantum neural networks. We consider two application scenarios namely, binary and multi-class classification, and show that for multiclass classification, the local cost function setting does not follow the claims of Cerezo et al; that is, the local cost function does not result in an extended quantum layer's depth. We also show that for multiclass classification, the overall performance in terms of accuracy for the global cost function setting is significantly higher than the local cost function setting. On the other hand, for binary classification, our results show that the local cost function setting follows the claims of Cerezo et al, and results in an extended depth of quantum layers. However, the global cost function setting still performs slightly better than the local cost function.

TI Sensitivity versus selectivity in entanglement detection via collective
   witnesses
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB In this paper, we introduce a supervised learning technique that harnesses artificial neural networks, along with the outcomes of collective entanglement measurements, to estimate the negativity of quantum states in two-qubit and qubit-qutrit systems. The resulting deep-learned collective entanglement witnesses offer the unique capability of continuous sensitivity and selectivity tuning. This instrument enables us to explore the tradeoff between sensitivity and selectivity in entanglement detection, a dimension not accessible to previously employed analytical witnesses. In particular, we demonstrate that there are experimentally cost-effective methods (in terms of the number of measurements) where sensitivity can be significantly improved at a slight expense of the selectivity of entanglement detection. This chosen approach is also favored due to its high generality and potential for superior performance compared to other types of entanglement witnesses. Our findings may pave the way for the development of more efficient and accurate entanglement detection methods in complex quantum systems, especially when considering realistic experimental imperfections.

TI T-Count Optimized Quantum Circuit Designs for Single-Precision
   Floating-Point Division
SO ELECTRONICS
AB The implementation of quantum computing processors for scientific applications includes quantum floating points circuits for arithmetic operations. This work adopts the standard division algorithms for floating-point numbers with restoring, non-restoring, and Goldschmidt division algorithms for single-precision inputs. The design proposals are carried out while using the quantum Clifford+T gates set, and resource estimates in terms of numbers of qubits, T-count, and T-depth are provided for the proposed circuits. By improving the leading zero detector (LZD) unit structure, the proposed division circuits show a significant reduction in the T-count when compared to the existing works on floating-point division.

Employing a collinear crossed-crystal scheme with type-I degenerate phase matching in barium borate (BBO), our source achieves a brightness of 9.5 k pairs/s/mW and a quantum state fidelity of 98.3%, making it a candidate for integration in microscopes and make use of the advantages of mid-visible optimized single-photon detection technologies.

TI Advancing hybrid quantum-classical algorithms via mean operators
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Hybrid quantum-classical algorithms have been suggested to control the quantum entanglement of many-body systems in noisy intermediate-scale quantum technology, and yet their applicability is limited by the numbers of qubits and quantum operations. Here, we propose a mean-operator theory which overcomes limitations by combining the advantages of hybrid algorithms and standard mean-field theory. We demonstrate that an introduction of a mean operator prepares an entangled target many-body state with a significantly reduced number of quantum operations. We also show that a class of mean operators is expressed as time-evolution operators, which indicates that our theory is directly applicable to quantum simulations with Rydberg atoms and trapped ions.

TI Bloch sphere analog of qudits using Heisenberg-Weyl Operators
SO PHYSICA SCRIPTA
AB We study an analogous Bloch sphere representation of higher-level quantum systems using the Heisenberg-Weyl operator basis. We introduce a parametrization method that will allow us to identify a real-valued Bloch vector for an arbitrary density operator. Before going into arbitrary d-level (d >= 3) quantum systems (qudits), we start our analysis with three-level ones (qutrits). It is well known that we need at least eight real parameters in the Bloch vector to describe arbitrary three-level quantum systems (qutrits). However, using our method we can divide these parameters into four weight, and four angular parameters, and find that the weight parameters are inducing a unit sphere in four-dimension. And, the four angular parameters determine whether a Bloch vector is physical. Therefore, unlike its qubit counterpart, the qutrit Bloch sphere does not exhibit a solid structure. Importantly, this construction allows us to define different properties of qutrits in terms of Bloch vector components. We also examine the two and three-dimensional sections of the sphere, which reveal a non-convex yet closed structure for physical qutrit states. Further, we apply our representation to derive mutually unbiased bases (MUBs), characterize unital maps for qutrits, and assess ensembles using the Hilbert-Schmidt and Bures metrics. Moreover, we extend this construction to qudits, showcasing its potential applicability beyond the qutrit scenario.

TI Quantum Squeezing-Enhanced Supersensitive Optomechanical Sensing
   (Invited)
SO LASER & OPTOELECTRONICS PROGRESS
AB Hybrid quantum systems have emerged as a key platform for promoting breakthroughs of quantum technology and sustainable development of quantum science. Cavity optomechanical systems, with their high integrability and strong tunability, show significant application values in fields such as electro-optomechanical transduction, quantum state preparation, and quantum precision metrology. It is hailed as a milestone in the history of photonics by Nature. Recent advances in laser cooling and micro/nanofabrication techniques have significantly enhanced the ability to manipulate and observe microscopic quantum systems such as atoms, photons, and electrons, facilitating the measurement technique transition from classical sensitivity limits to quantum effect-based supersensitive sensing, achieving exponential performance gains. Here, we review the latest advances in quantum squeezing-enhanced quantum sensing performances, emphasizing the key advantages of quantum compression in achieving ultra-sensitive quantum sensing. From a broader perspective, leveraging squeezing-enhanced supersensitive quantum sensing provides a promising path for improving performance in gravitational-wave detection, dark-matter searches, quantum illumination, and biomolecular tracking.

TI Classical and Quantum SVM for Electromyography-Based Myopathy Detection:
   A Comparative Exploration
SO POLISH JOURNAL OF MEDICAL PHYSICS AND ENGINEERING
AB Introduction: Electromyography (EMG) analysis is one of the most fundamental approaches for diagnosing neuromuscular diseases. Current advancements in technology have the potential to improve diagnosis accuracy using artificial intelligence (AI). Quantum machine learning (QML), while still in its early stages, offers promising potential for various medical applications, but its effectiveness in real-world diagnostic tasks needs further exploration. Thus, the aim of this study is to employ both quantum and classical support vector machines (SVMs) to classify EMG signals into two classes, healthy and myopathy, and compare their performance.Methods: Various approaches were tested; classical SVM and quantum-kernel-based SVM, both with manually extracted features, and convolutional neural network (CNN)-based deep features extraction techniques. This allows for an evaluation of the strengths and limitations of this new technology, acknowledging the potential of both classical and quantum methods.Results: The obtained results showed that the proposed quantum methods yielded promising outcomes and comparable to classical methods. Particularly, the competitive results of the quantum SVM (QSVM) with the CNN-based deep feature extraction approach, which delivered a high training and testing accuracies of up to 96.7% and 85.1%, respectively.Conclusion: These findings encourages the necessity for more advanced QML research, particularly in medical applications as quantum technology progresses.

TI Diamond surface functionalization via visible light-driven C-H
   activation for nanoscale quantum sensing
SO PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF
   AMERICA
AB Nitrogen- vacancy (NV) centers in diamond are a promising platform for nanoscale NMR sensing. Despite significant progress toward using NV centers to detect and localize nuclear spins down to the single spin level, NV- based spectroscopy of individual, intact, arbitrary target molecules remains elusive. Such sensing requires that target molecules are immobilized within nanometers of NV centers with long spin coherence. The inert nature of diamond typically requires harsh functionalization techniques such as thermal annealing or plasma processing, limiting the scope of functional groups that can be attached to the surface. Solution- phase chemical methods can be readily generalized to install diverse functional groups, but they have not been widely explored for single- crystal diamond surfaces. Moreover, realizing shallow NV centers with long spin coherence times requires highly ordered single- crystal surfaces, and solution- phase functionalization has not yet been shown with such demanding conditions. In this work, we report a versatile strategy to directly functionalize C-H bonds on single- crystal diamond surfaces under ambient conditions using visible light, forming C-F, C-Cl, C-S, and C-N bonds at the surface. This method is compatible with NV centers within 10 nm of the surface with spin coherence times comparable to the state of the art. As a proof- of- principle demonstration, we use shallow ensembles of NV centers to detect nuclear spins from surface- bound functional groups. Our approach to surface functionalization opens the door to deploying NV centers as a tool for chemical sensing and single- molecule spectroscopy.

TI Generation of quantum phases of matter and finding a maximum-weight
   independent set of unit-disk graphs using Rydberg atoms
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Recent progress in quantum computing and quantum simulation of many-body systems with arrays of neutral atoms using Rydberg excitation has provided unforeseen opportunities towards computational advantage in solving various optimization problems. The problem of a maximum-weight independent set of unit-disk graphs is an example of an NP-hard optimization problem. It involves finding the largest set of vertices with the maximum sum of their weights for a graph which has edges connecting all pairs of vertices within a unit distance. This problem can be solved using quantum annealing with an array of interacting Rydberg atoms. For a particular graph, a spatial arrangement of atoms represents vertices of the graph, while the detuning from resonance at Rydberg excitation defines the weights of these vertices. The edges of the graph can be drawn according to the unit-disk criterion. Maximum-weight independent sets can be obtained by applying a variational quantum adiabatic algorithm. We consider driving the quantum system of interacting atoms to the many-body ground state using a nonlinear quasiadiabatic profile for sweeping the Rydberg detuning. We also propose using a quantum wire, which is a set of auxiliary atoms of a different chemical element, to mediate strong coupling between the remote vertices of the graph. We investigate this effect for different lengths of the quantum wire. We also investigate the quantum phases of matter realizing commensurate and incommensurate phases in oneand two-dimensional spatial arrangements of the atomic array.

TI Dual unitary circuits in random geometries
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICS A-MATHEMATICAL AND THEORETICAL
AB Recently introduced dual unitary brickwork circuits have been recognised as paradigmatic exactly solvable quantum chaotic many-body systems with tunable degree of ergodicity and mixing. Here we show that regularity of the circuit lattice is not crucial for exact solvability. We consider a circuit where random 2-qubit dual unitary gates sit at intersections of random arrangements of straight lines in two dimensions (mikado) and analytically compute the variance of the spatio-temporal correlation function of local operators. Note that the average correlator vanishes due to local Haar randomness of the gates. The result can be physically motivated for two random mikado settings. The first corresponds to the thermal state of free particles carrying internal qubit degrees of freedom which experience interaction at kinematic crossings, while the second represents rotationally symmetric (random euclidean) space-time.

AB When a bug is detected by testing a quantum program on a quantum computer, we want to determine its location to fix it. To locate the bug, the quantum program is divided into several segments, and each segment is tested. However, to prepare a quantum state that is input to a segment, it is necessary to execute all the segments ahead of that segment in a quantum computer. This means that the cost of testing each segment depends on its location. We can also locate a buggy segment only if it is confirmed that there are no bugs in all segments ahead of that buggy segment. Since a quantum program is tested statistically on the basis of measurement results, there is a tradeoff between testing accuracy and cost. Although these characteristics are unique to quantum programs and complicate locating bugs, they have not been investigated. We suggest for the first time that these characteristics should be considered to efficiently locate bugs. We are also the first to propose a bug-locating method that takes these characteristics into account. The results from experiments indicate that the bug-locating cost, represented as the number of executed quantum gates, can be reduced with the proposed method compared with naive methods.

TI Adjusting line quantum sensing to improve leaf area index measurements
   and estimations in forests
SO METHODSX
AB Rapid and reliable estimation of leaf area index (LAI), a crucial parameter in process-based models of vegetation cover response, is important in ecological studies. The Beer-Lambert law is widely used to calculate forest LAI, but data collection methods are time-consuming and calculations are often inaccurate. Our objective was to improve the accuracy of Beer-Lambert law-based LAI estimation by employing indirect data collection and location-specific light extinction coefficients (K). Canopy transmittance and LAI of two 100 m(2) temperate forest stands in southwestern Germany, one managed and one protected, was estimated using line quantum sensing (LQS) at 45,0 0 0 points per stand. The Beer-Lambert law was then inverted to estimate LAI using the measured transmittance with a K of 0.53-0.54. Hemispherical reference photographs were used as independent validation data to determine ideal K values. Experimental data demonstrated that LAI values estimated using LQS with adjusted K values were more accurate than those calculated using the basic application of the Beer-Lambert law. LQS results correlated with those determined using hemispherical photography for both the managed (R-2 = 0.80) and protected (R 2 = 0.81) stands. Overall, these findings show that adjusting K values for individual forest systems improves the accuracy of LAI estimation. The modified method is more accurate than that using fixed K ranges. The modified method accounts for individual ecosystems, with different K values for different environments. The method can accurately reflect the dynamic changes of forest canopy structure, allowing integration of additional environmental measurements. (c) 2022 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier B.V.

TI Quantum-assisted federated learning for radar-based object tracking in
   IoT-enabled environments
SO EPJ QUANTUM TECHNOLOGY
AB Object tracking with radar has become a key part of many IoT applications, such as smart transportation, autonomous robotics, and ambient surveillance. Nevertheless, conventional machine learning techniques have fatal problems, such as privacy, noisy radar signals, latency, and generalization in the distributed IoT systems. This paper proposes a new model, Quantum-Assisted Federated Learning (QAFL), a combination of quantum machine learning (QML) and federated learning (FL) to solve these problems, which can effectively and privately identify radar objects and their routes. The suggested QAFL architecture has a new Hybrid Angle-Amplitude Encoding (HAAE) scheme with multi-layer Variational Quantum Circuits (VQCs) to support the effective extraction of features in the presence of noisy and non-homogeneous radar sensor data. We also present a Quantum-Enhanced Federated Averaging (Quantum-FedAvg) algorithm that can be used to improve the efficiency of the training, privacy, and scalability of distributed IoT nodes. Comprehensive experimental tests based on the CARRADA automotive radar dataset show that QAFL achieves large performance improvements compared to classical federated learning baselines, in terms of classification accuracy improvements of up to 7.2 percentage points with the low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) regime, trajectory prediction error reduction of up to 23 percent, as well as considerable communication overhead and training latency reductions. Such results highlight the enormous potential of quantum-enhanced federated learning systems to radar-based internet-of-things tracking systems.

TI Satellite-Based Quantum Key Distribution in the Presence of Bypass
   Channels
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB The security of prepare-and-measure satellite-based quantum key distribution (QKD), under restricted eavesdropping scenarios, is addressed. We particularly consider cases where the eavesdropper, Eve, has limited access to the transmitted signal by Alice and/or Bob's receiver station. This restriction is modeled by lossy channels between relevant parties, where the transmissivity of such channels can, in principle, be bounded by monitoring techniques. An artifact of such lossy channels is the possibility of having bypass channels, those that are not accessible to Eve but that may not necessarily be characterized by the users either. This creates interesting unexplored scenarios for analyzing QKD security. In this paper, we obtain generic bounds on the key rate in the presence of bypass channels and apply them to continuous variable QKD protocols with Gaussian encoding with direct and reverse reconciliation. We find regimes of operation in which the above restrictions on Eve can considerably improve system performance. We also develop customized bounds for several protocols in the BB84 family and show that, in certain regimes, even the simple protocol of BB84 with weak coherent pulses is able to offer positive key rates at high channel losses, which would otherwise be impossible under an unrestricted Eve. In this case, the limitation on Eve would allow Alice to send signals with larger intensities than the optimal value under an ideal Eve, which effectively reduces the effective channel loss. In all these cases, the part of the transmitted signal that does not reach Eve can play a nontrivial role in specifying the achievable key rate. Our work opens up new security frameworks for spaceborne quantum communications systems.

TI Gravitationally modulated quantum correlations: Discriminating classical
   and quantum models of ultra-compact objects with Bell nonlocality
SO PHYSICS LETTERS B
AB We investigate the relation between quantum nonlocality and gravity at the astrophysical scale, both in the classical and quantum regimes. Considering a gedanken experiment involving particle pairs orbiting in the strong gravitational field of ultra-compact objects, we find that the violation of Bell inequality acquires an angular modulation factor that strongly depends on the nature of the gravitational source. We show how such gravitationally-induced modulation of quantum nonlocality readily discriminates between black holes (both classical and inclusive of quantum corrections) and string fuzzballs, i.e., the true quantum description of ultra- compact objects according to string theory. These findings promote Bell nonlocality as a potentially key tool in putting quantum gravity to the test.

TI Implementation of quantum measurements using classical resources and
   only a single ancillary qubit
SO NPJ QUANTUM INFORMATION
AB We propose a scheme to implement general quantum measurements, also known as Positive Operator Valued Measures (POVMs) in dimension d using only classical resources and a single ancillary qubit. Our method is based on probabilistic implementation of d-outcome measurements which is followed by postselection of some of the received outcomes. We conjecture that success probability of our scheme is larger than a constant independent of d for all POVMs in dimension d. Crucially, this conjecture implies the possibility of realizing arbitrary nonadaptive quantum measurement protocol on d-dimensional system using a single auxiliary qubit with only a constant overhead in sampling complexity. We show that the conjecture holds for typical rank-one Haar-random POVMs in arbitrary dimensions. Furthermore, we carry out extensive numerical computations showing success probability above a constant for a variety of extremal POVMs, including SIC-POVMs in dimension up to 1299. Finally, we argue that our scheme can be favorable for experimental realization of POVMs, as noise compounding in circuits required by our scheme is typically substantially lower than in the standard scheme that directly uses Naimark's dilation theorem.

SO OPTIMIZATION AND ENGINEERING
AB This study focuses on the optimization of a refinery scheduling process with the help of an adiabatic quantum computer, and more concretely one of the quantum annealers developed by D-Wave Systems. We present an algorithm for finding a global optimal solution of a MILP that leans on a solver for QUBO problems, and apply it to various possible cases of refinery scheduling optimization. We analyze the inconveniences found during the whole process, whether due to the heuristic nature of D-Wave or the implications of reducing a MILP to QUBO, and present some experimental results.

TI Multicopy Adaptive Local Discrimination: Strongest Possible Two-Qubit
   Nonlocal Bases
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB Ensembles of composite quantum states can exhibit nonlocal behavior in the sense that their optimal discrimination may require global operations. Such an ensemble containing N pairwise orthogonal pure states, however, can always be perfectly distinguished under an adaptive local scheme if (N - 1) copies of the state are available. In this Letter, we provide examples of orthonormal bases in two-qubit Hilbert space whose adaptive discrimination require three copies of the state. For this composite system, we analyze multicopy adaptive local distinguishability of orthogonal ensembles in full generality which, in turn, assigns varying nonlocal strength to different such ensembles. We also come up with ensembles whose discrimination under an adaptive separable scheme require less numbers of copies than adaptive local schemes. Our construction finds important application in multipartite secret sharing tasks and indicates toward an intriguing superadditivity phenomenon for locally accessible information.

TI Implementation of discrete positive operator valued measures on linear
   optical systems using cosine-sine decomposition
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Positive operator valued measurements (POVMs) play an important role in efficient quantum communication and computation. While optical systems are one of the strongest candidates for long distance quantum communication and information processing, efficient methods to implement POVMs in these systems are scarce. Here we propose an all-optical scheme to implement an arbitrary POVM using linear optical components on m-dimensional Hilbert space of internal degrees of freedom. Linear optical nature of the proposed scheme makes it efficient and robust. We show how the scheme can be applied for state tomography and for preparing arbitrary mixed states.

TI Pseudo-fermion functional renormalization group for spin models
SO REPORTS ON PROGRESS IN PHYSICS
AB For decades, frustrated quantum magnets have been a seed for scientific progress and innovation in condensed matter. As much as the numerical tools for low-dimensional quantum magnetism have thrived and improved in recent years due to breakthroughs inspired by quantum information and quantum computation, higher-dimensional quantum magnetism can be considered as the final frontier, where strong quantum entanglement, multiple ordering channels, and manifold ways of paramagnetism culminate. At the same time, efforts in crystal synthesis have induced a significant increase in the number of tangible frustrated magnets which are generically three-dimensional in nature, creating an urgent need for quantitative theoretical modeling. We review the pseudo-fermion (PF) and pseudo-Majorana (PM) functional renormalization group (FRG) and their specific ability to address higher-dimensional frustrated quantum magnetism. First developed more than a decade ago, the PFFRG interprets a Heisenberg model Hamiltonian in terms of Abrikosov pseudofermions, which is then treated in a diagrammatic resummation scheme formulated as a renormalization group flow of m-particle pseudofermion vertices. The article reviews the state of the art of PFFRG and PMFRG and discusses their application to exemplary domains of frustrated magnetism, but most importantly, it makes the algorithmic and implementation details of these methods accessible to everyone. By thus lowering the entry barrier to their application, we hope that this review will contribute towards establishing PFFRG and PMFRG as the numerical methods for addressing frustrated quantum magnetism in higher spatial dimensions.

TI Energy Efficiency Analysis of Post-Quantum Cryptographic Algorithms
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB Classical cryptographic schemes in use today are based on the difficulty of certain number theoretic problems. Security is guaranteed by the fact that the computational work required to break the core mechanisms of these schemes on a conventional computer is infeasible; however, the difficulty of these problems would not withstand the computational power of a large-scale quantum computer. To this end, the post-quantum cryptography (PQC) standardization process initiated by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) is well underway. In addition to the evaluation criteria provided by NIST, the energy consumption of these candidate algorithms is also an important criterion to consider due to the use of battery-operated devices, high-performance computing environments where energy costs are critical, as well as in the interest of green computing. In this paper, the energy consumption of PQC candidates is evaluated on an Intel Core i7-6700 CPU using PAPI, the Performance API. The energy measurements are categorized based on their proposed security level and cryptographic functionality. The results are then further subdivided based on the underlying mechanism used in order to identify the most energy-efficient schemes. Lastly, IgProf is used to identify the most energy-consuming subroutines within a select number of submissions to highlight potential areas for optimization.

TI Ab initio calculations of nonlinear susceptibility and
   multiphonon mixing processes in a 2DEG-piezoelectric heterostructure
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Solid-state elastic-wave phonons are a promising platform for a wide range of quantum information applications including facilitating quantum transduction from microwave to optical electromagnetic fields, long-lived quantum memories, in addition to potentially acting as qubits themselves. An outstanding challenge and enabling capability in harnessing phonons for quantum information processing is achieving sufficiently strong nonlinear interactions between them. To this end, we propose a general architecture for generating strong quantum phononic nonlinearity using piezoelectric-semiconductor heterostructures consisting of a piezoelectric acoustic material hosting phononic modes that is in direct proximity to a two-dimensional electron gas (2DEG). Each phonon in the piezoelectric material carries an electric field, which extends into the 2DEG. The fields induce polarization of 2DEG electrons, which in turn interact with other piezoelectric phononic electric fields. The net result is coupling between the electric fields associated with the various phonon modes. We derive, from first principles, the nonlinear phononic susceptibility of a piezo-2DEG system and provide a prescription to calculate all orders of the susceptibility in a perturbative expansion. We show that many nonlinear processes are strongly favored at high electron mobility, motivating the use of the 2DEG to mediate the nonlinearities. We derive the first, second, and third-order susceptibilities and calculate them for the case of a lithium niobate surface acoustic wave interacting with a GaAs-AlGaAs heterostructure 2DEG. We show that, for this system, the strong third-order phononic nonlinearities generated could enable single-phonon Kerr shift in an acoustic cavity that exceeds realistic cavity linewidths, potentially leading to a new class of acoustic qubit. We further show that the strong second-order nonlinearity could be used to produce a high-gain, traveling-wave parametric amplifier to amplify-and ultimately detect-the outputs of the acoustic cavity qubits. Assuming favorable losses in such a system, the combination of these capabilities, combined with the ability to efficiently transduce phonons from microwave electromagnetic fields in transmission lines, thus hold promise for creating all-acoustic quantum information processors.

TI Improvement of optical noise in optical-injection-locked quantum dot
   lasers epitaxially grown on silicon by reducing external carrier noise
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICS-PHOTONICS
AB This study theoretically investigates the impact of external carrier noise from pumping sources on the optical noise of epitaxial quantum dot (QD) lasers on silicon. The findings indicate that the spectral linewidth and relative intensity noise (RIN) of silicon-based QD lasers using a quiet pump are significantly reduced. At 5.5 times the threshold current, the spectral linewidth decreases from 337.2 kHz to 213.2 kHz, and the RIN decreases from -141.3 dB Hz-1 to -168.8 dB Hz-1. This reduction is attributed to the lower external carrier noise level of the quiet pump, which also suppresses the spectral linewidth rebroadening effect at a high bias current. Moreover, when external optical injection locking is applied, the spectral linewidth further decreases to 24 kHz at an injection ratio of -70 dB and to 1.8 mHz at 0 dB. The RIN also slightly decreases to -172.4 dB Hz-1 with an injection ratio of 10. These results demonstrate that using a quiet pump is an effective and manageable strategy for significantly reducing both the spectral linewidth and RIN of QD lasers, thereby facilitating their application in next-generation photonic integrated circuits, continuous-variable quantum key distribution, quantum computing and ultra-precise quantum sensing.

TI Entanglement and Entropy Squeezing for Moving Two Two-Level Atoms
   Interaction with a Radiation Field
SO CMC-COMPUTERS MATERIALS & CONTINUA
AB In this paper, we analyzed squeezing in the information entropy, quantum state fidelity, and qubit-qubit entanglement in a time-dependent system. The proposed model consists of two qubits that interact with a two-mode electromagnetic field under the dissipation effect. An analytical solution is calculated by considering the constants for the equations of motion. The effect of the general form of the time-dependent for qubit-field coupling and the dissipation term on the temporal behavior of the qubit-qubit entanglement, quantum state fidelity, entropy, and variance squeezing are examined. It is shown that the intervals of entanglement caused more squeezing for the case of considering the time-dependent parameters. Additionally, the entanglement between the qubits became more substantial for the case of time dependence. Fidelity and negativity rapidly reached the minimum values by increasing the effect of the dissipation parameter. Moreover, the amount of variance squeezing and the amplitude of the oscillations decreased considerably when the time dependence increased, but the fluctuations increased substantially. We show the relation between entropy and variance squeezing in the presence and absence of the dissipation parameter during the interaction period. This result enables new parameters to control the degree of entanglement and squeezing, especially in quantum communication.

AB In the work on superconducting parametric amplifiers, the frequency band below one gigahertz is calling for systematic improvements. Despite a prospect for ultralow added noise, bandwidth limitations have slowed down the integration of such amplifiers into sub-GHz experiments demanding fast (< 1 mu s) readout speeds. Here, we study the impedance engineering of a flux-driven Josephson parametric amplifier (JPA) at 600 MHz. We propose, simulate and experimentally demonstrate a partially reconfigurable impedance transformer. The transformer enhances the JPA bandwidth to a state-of-the-art value of 10 MHz at 20 dB gain. Our amplifier has immediate applications in the readout of cryogenic sensors and in the reflectometry of quantum dots for spin qubit quantum computing.

TI Scrambling and recovery of quantum information in inhomogeneous quenches
   in two-dimensional conformal field theories
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB We study various quantum quench processes induced by the Mobius/sine-square deformation of the Hamiltonian in two-dimensional conformal field theories starting from the thermofield double state in the two copies of the Hilbert space. These quantum quenches, some of which are directly related to the operator entanglement of the time -evolution operators, allow us to study scrambling and recovery of quantum information. In particular, under the sine -square deformed time evolution, we show from the time dependence of mutual information that the Bell pairs, initially shared by the subsystems of the two Hilbert spaces, may revive even after the mutual information for small subsystems is completely destroyed by quantum information scrambling dynamics. This mutual information is robust against the strong scrambling dynamics. As a consequence, the steady state has a nonlocal correlation shared not by any of two parties but by three parties. In the holographic dual description, a wormhole connecting the two Hilbert spaces may nonlinearly grow with time during the quantum quenches. We also propose effective pictures that describe the dynamics of mutual information during the time evolution by inhomogeneous Hamiltonians.

TI On the Use of Quantum Reinforcement Learning in Energy-Efficiency
   Scenarios
SO ENERGIES
AB In the last few years, deep reinforcement learning has been proposed as a method to perform online learning in energy-efficiency scenarios such as HVAC control, electric car energy management, or building energy management, just to mention a few. On the other hand, quantum machine learning was born during the last decade to extend classic machine learning to a quantum level. In this work, we propose to study the benefits and limitations of quantum reinforcement learning to solve energy-efficiency scenarios. As a testbed, we use existing energy-efficiency-based reinforcement learning simulators and compare classic algorithms with the quantum proposal. Results in HVAC control, electric vehicle fuel consumption, and profit optimization of electrical charging stations applications suggest that quantum neural networks are able to solve problems in reinforcement learning scenarios with better accuracy than their classical counterpart, obtaining a better cumulative reward with fewer parameters to be learned.

TI On the Expressibility and Overfitting of Quantum Circuit Learning
SO ACM TRANSACTIONS ON QUANTUM COMPUTING
AB Applying quantum processors to model a high-dimensional function approximator is a typical method in quantum machine learning with potential advantage. It is conjectured that the unitarity of quantum circuits provides possible regularization to avoid overfitting. However, it is not clear how the regularization interplays with the expressibility under the limitation of current Noisy-Intermediate Scale Quantum devices. In this article, we perform simulations and theoretical analysis of the quantum circuit learning problem with hardware-efficient ansatz. Thorough numerical simulations show that the expressibility and generalization error scaling of the ansatz saturate when the circuit depth increases, implying the automatic regularization to avoid the overfitting issue in the quantum circuit learning scenario. This observation is supported by the theory on PAC learnability, which proves that VC dimension is upper bounded due to the locality and unitarity of the hardware-efficient ansatz. Our study provides supporting evidence for automatic regularization by unitarity to suppress overfitting and guidelines for possible performance improvement under hardware constraints.

TI Quantum optimal control with quantum computers: A hybrid algorithm
   featuring machine learning optimization
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB We develop a hybrid quantum-classical algorithm to solve an optimal population transfer problem for a molecule subject to a laser pulse. The evolution of the molecular wave function under the laser pulse is simulated on a quantum computer, while the optimal pulse is iteratively shaped via a machine learning (evolutionary) algorithm. A method to encode on the quantum computer the n-electrons wave function is discussed, the circuits accomplishing its quantum simulation are derived and the scalability in terms of number of operations is discussed. Performance on noisy intermediate-scale quantum devices (IBM Q X2) is provided to assess the current technological gap. Furthermore the hybrid algorithm is tested on a quantum emulator to compare performance of the evolutionary algorithm with standard ones. Our results show that such algorithms are able to outperform the optimization with a downhill simplex method and provide performance comparable to more advanced (but quantum-computer unfriendly) algorithms such as Rabitz's or gradient-based optimization.

TI Effects of photon statistics in wave mixing on a single qubit
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB We theoretically consider wave mixing under the irradiation of a single qubit by two photon fields. The first signal is a classical monochromatic drive, while the second one is a nonclassical light. Particularly, we address two examples of a nonclassical light: (i) a broadband squeezed light and (ii) a periodically excited quantum superposition of Fock states with 0 and 1 photons. The mixing of classical and nonclassical photon fields gives rise to side peaks due to the elastic multiphoton scattering. We show that a side peaks structure is distinct from the situation when two classical fields are mixed. The most striking feature is that some peaks are absent. The analysis of peak amplitudes can be used to probe photon statistics in the nonclassical mode.

TI ResQNets: a residual approach for mitigating barren plateaus in quantum
   neural networks
SO EPJ QUANTUM TECHNOLOGY
AB The barren plateau problem in quantum neural networks (QNNs) is a significant challenge that hinders the practical success of QNNs. In this paper, we introduce residual quantum neural networks (ResQNets) as a solution to address this problem. ResQNets are inspired by classical residual neural networks and involve splitting the conventional QNN architecture into multiple quantum nodes, each containing its own parameterized quantum circuit, and introducing residual connections between these nodes. Our study demonstrates the efficacy of ResQNets by comparing their performance with that of conventional QNNs and plain quantum neural networks through multiple training experiments and analyzing the cost function landscapes. Our results show that the incorporation of residual connections results in improved training performance. Therefore, we conclude that ResQNets offer a promising solution to overcome the barren plateau problem in QNNs and provide a potential direction for future research in the field of quantum machine learning.

TI A PHYSICAL MODEL OF QUANTUM BIT BEHAVIOR BASED ON A PROGRAMMABLE FPGA
   INTEGRATED CIRCUIT
SO COMPUTER SCIENCE-AGH
AB The rapidly developing field of quantum computing and the ongoing lack of widely available quantum computers create the need for scientists to build their simulators. However, mathematical simulation of such circuits usually ignores many aspects and problems found in real quantum systems. In this article, the authors describe a quantum bit emulator based on FPGA integrated circuits. In this case, FPGA technology provides real-time massive parallelism of the modeled physical phenomena. The modeled QUBIT is represented using a Bloch sphere. Its quantum state is set and modified only by precise pulses of an electrical signal, and with the help of similar pulses, it manifests its current state in real time. The constructed QUBIT was additionally equipped with decoherence mechanisms and with circuits that intentionally respond to internal and external noises that distort its current quantum state. This article presents and discusses how such a physically built emulator works.

TI Phase transitions, symmetries, and tunneling in Kerr parametric
   oscillators
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Quantum Kerr parametric oscillators (KPOs) are systems out of equilibrium with a wide range of applications in quantum computing, quantum sensing, and fundamental research. They have been realized in superconducting circuits and photonic platforms. In this work, we explore the onset of ground-state and excited-state quantum phase transitions in KPOs, focusing on the role of the phase-space rotational symmetry when the driving frequency is mu times the oscillator's natural frequency, specifically for mu = 1, 2, 3, 4. These cases are experimentally accessible in superconducting circuits, where the Floquet quasienergy spectrum can also be studied as a function of tunable control parameters. Using the classical Hamiltonian of the system, we identify the stationary points associated with quantum phase transitions and analyze the emergence of both real and avoided level crossings, examining their influence on the energy spectrum and tunneling dynamics. Our findings provide insights into the engineering of robust quantum states, quantum dynamics control, and onset of quantum phase transitions with implications for critical quantum sensing.

TI Automatic and Effective Discovery of Quantum Kernels
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON EMERGING TOPICS IN COMPUTATIONAL INTELLIGENCE
AB Quantum computing can empower machine learning models by enabling kernel machines to leverage quantum kernels for representing similarity measures between data. Quantum kernels are able to capture relationships in the data that are not efficiently computable on classical devices. However, there is no straightforward method to engineer the optimal quantum kernel for each specific use case. We present an approach to this problem, which employs optimization techniques, similar to those used in neural architecture search and AutoML, to automatically find an optimal kernel in a heuristic manner. To this purpose we define an algorithm for constructing a quantum circuit implementing the similarity measure as a combinatorial object, which is evaluated based on a cost function and then iteratively modified using a meta-heuristic optimization technique. The cost function can encode many criteria ensuring favorable statistical properties of the candidate solution, such as the rank of the Dynamical Lie Algebra. Importantly, our approach is independent of the optimization technique employed. The results obtained by testing our approach on a high-energy physics problem demonstrate that, in the best-case scenario, we can either match or improve testing accuracy with respect to the manual design approach, showing the potential of our technique to deliver superior results with reduced effort.

TI Electron shelving of a superconducting artificial atom
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Interfacing long-lived qubits with propagating photons is a fundamental challenge in quantum technology. Cavity and circuit quantum electrodynamics (cQED) architectures rely on an off-resonant cavity, which blocks the qubit emission and enables a quantum non-demolition (QND) dispersive readout. However, no such buffer mode is necessary for controlling a large class of three-level systems that combine a metastable qubit transition with a bright cycling transition, using the electron shelving effect. Here we demonstrate shelving of a circuit atom, fluxonium, placed inside a microwave waveguide. With no cavity modes in the setup, the qubit coherence time exceeds 50 mu s, and the cycling transition's radiative lifetime is under 100 ns. By detecting a homodyne fluorescence signal from the cycling transition, we implement a QND readout of the qubit and account for readout errors using a minimal optical pumping model. Our result establishes a resource-efficient (cavityless) alternative to cQED for controlling superconducting qubits.
   Existing schemes for coherent control and measurements in superconducting circuits rely on the coupling between superconducting qubits and cavity photons. Here the authors implement conditional fluorescence readout of a fluxonium qubit placed inside an open waveguide, with no coupling to cavity modes.

TI Low-dissipation data bus via coherent quantum dynamics
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
AB The transfer of information between two physical locations is an essential component of both classical and quantum computing. In quantum computing the transfer of information must be coherent to preserve quantum states and hence the quantum information. We establish a simple protocol for transferring one-and two-electron encoded logical qubits in quantum dot arrays. The theoretical energetic cost of this protocol is calculated-in particular, the cost of freezing and unfreezing tunneling between quantum dots. Our results are compared with the energetic cost of shuttling qubits in quantum dot arrays and transferring classical information using classical information buses. Only our protocol can manage constant dissipation for any chain length. This protocol could reduce the cooling requirements and constraints on scalable architectures for quantum dot quantum computers.

TI Capacity of Quantum Private Information Retrieval With Multiple Servers
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INFORMATION THEORY
AB We study the capacity of quantum private information retrieval (QPIR) with multiple servers. In the QPIR problem with multiple servers, a user retrieves a classical file by downloading quantum systems from multiple servers each of which contains the copy of a classical file set while the identity of the downloaded file is not leaked to each server. The QPIR capacity is defined as the maximum rate of the file size over the whole dimension of the downloaded quantum systems. When the servers are assumed to share prior entanglement, we prove that the QPIR capacity with multiple servers is 1 regardless of the number of servers and files. We construct a rate-one protocol only with two servers. This capacity-achieving protocol outperforms its classical counterpart in the sense of the capacity, server secrecy, and upload cost. The strong converse bound is derived concisely without using any secrecy condition. We also prove that the capacity of multi-round QPIR is 1.

TI Quantum classifiers for domain adaptation
SO QUANTUM INFORMATION PROCESSING
AB Transfer learning (TL), a crucial subfield of machine learning, aims to accomplish a task in the target domain with the acquired knowledge of the source domain. Specifically, effective domain adaptation (DA) facilitates the delivery of the TL task where all the data samples of the two domains are distributed in the same feature space. In this paper, two quantum implementations of the DA classifier are presented with quantum speedup compared with the classical DA classifier. One implementation, the quantum basic linear algebra subroutines-based classifier, can predict the labels of the target domain data with logarithmic resources in the number and dimension of the given data. The other implementation efficiently accomplishes the DA task through a variational hybrid quantum-classical procedure.

TI Multimodule microwave assembly for fast readout and charge-noise
   characterization of silicon quantum dots
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW APPLIED
AB Fast measurements of quantum devices is useful in areas such as quantum sensing, quantum computing, and nanodevice quality analysis. Here, we develop a superconductor-semiconductor multimodule microwave assembly to demonstrate charge-state readout at the state of the art. The assembly consist of a superconducting readout resonator interfaced to a silicon-on-insulator (SOI) chiplet containing quantum dots (QDs) in a high-x nanowire transistor. The superconducting chiplet contains resonant and coupling elements as well as LC filters that, when interfaced with the silicon chip, result in a resonant frequency f = 2.12 GHz, a loaded quality factor Q = 850, and a resonator impedance Z = 470 S2. Combined with the large gate lever arms of SOI technology, we achieve a minimum integration time for single and double QD transitions of 2.77 and 13.5 ns, respectively. We utilize the assembly to measure charge noise over 9 decades of frequency up to 500 kHz and find a 1 / f dependence across the whole frequency spectrum as well as a charge-noise level of 4 mu eV/ root Hz at 1 Hz. The modular microwave circuitry presented here can be directly utilized in conjunction with other quantum devices to improve the readout performance as well as enable large bandwidth noise spectroscopy, all without the complexity of superconductor-semiconductor monolithic fabrication.

TI Shallow NV centers augmented by exploiting n-type diamond
SO CARBON
AB Creation of nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers at the nanoscale surface region in diamond, while retaining their excellent spin and optical properties, is essential for applications in quantum technology. Here, we demonstrate the extension of the spin-coherence time (T-2), the stabilization of the charge state, and an improvement of the creation yield of NV centers formed by the ion-implantation technique at a depth of similar to 15 nm in phosphorus-doped n-type diamond. The longest T-2 of about 580 mu s of a shallow NV center approaches the one in bulk diamond limited by the nuclear spins of natural abundant C-13. The averaged T-2 in n-type diamond is over 1.7 times longer than that in pure non-doped diamond. Moreover, the stabilization of the charge state and the more than twofold improvement of the creation yield are confirmed. The enhancements for the shallow NV centers in an n-type diamond-semiconductor are significant for future integrated quantum devices. (C) 2021 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Variational quantum solver employing the PDS energy functional
SO QUANTUM
AB Recently a new class of quantum algorithms that are based on the quantum computation of the connected moment expansion has been reported to find the ground and excited state energies. In particular, the Peeters-Devreese-Soldatov (PDS) formulation is found variational and bearing the potential for further combining with the existing variational quantum infrastructure. Here we find that the PDS formulation can be considered as a new energy functional of which the PDS energy gradient can be employed in a conventional variational quantum solver. In comparison with the usual variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) and the original static PDS approach, this new variational quantum solver offers an effective approach to navigate the dynamics to be free from getting trapped in the local minima that refer to different states, and achieve high accuracy at finding the ground state and its energy through the rotation of the trial wave function of modest quality, thus improves the accuracy and efficiency of the quantum simulation. We demonstrate the performance of the proposed variational quantum solver for toy models, H-2 molecule, and strongly correlated planar H-4 system in some challenging situations. In all the case studies, the proposed variational quantum approach outperforms the usual VQE and static PDS calculations even at the lowest order. We also discuss the limitations of the proposed approach and its preliminary execution for model Hamiltonian on the NISQ device.

TI Quantum logic with spin qubits crossing the surface code threshold
SO NATURE
AB High-fidelity control of quantum bits is paramount for the reliable execution of quantum algorithms and for achieving fault tolerance-the ability to correct errors faster than they occur(1). The central requirement for fault tolerance is expressed in terms of an error threshold. Whereas the actual threshold depends on many details, a common target is the approximately 1% error threshold of the well-known surface code(2,3). Reaching two-qubit gate fidelities above 99% has been a long-standing major goal for semiconductor spin qubits. These qubits are promising for scaling, as they can leverage advanced semiconductor technology(4). Here we report a spin-based quantum processor in silicon with single-qubit and two-qubit gate fidelities, all of which are above 99.5%, extracted from gate-set tomography. The average single-qubit gate fidelities remain above 99% when including crosstalk and idling errors on the neighbouring qubit. Using this high-fidelity gate set, we execute the demanding task of calculating molecular ground-state energies using a variational quantum eigensolver algorithm(5). Having surpassed the 99% barrier for the two-qubit gate fidelity, semiconductor qubits are well positioned on the path to fault tolerance and to possible applications in the era of noisy intermediate-scale quantum devices.

Analyzed states resemble the Dicke states, whereas the interactions occur only between specific subsystems related by the action of the selected group. The states constructed by this technique exhibit desired symmetry properties and form a natural resource for less-symmetric quantum informational tasks. We propose quantum circuits efficiently generating such states, which in general have smaller complexity than the circuits necessary to create fully symmetric entangled states. Exemplary five-qubit quantum states are simulated on quantum computers.

TI Deep anomaly detection for active attacks on the receiver in quantum key
   distribution
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB Traditional countermeasures against attacks targeting the receiver in quantum key distribution (QKD) systems often suffer from poor compatibility with deployed infrastructure, the risk of introducing new vulnerabilities, and limited applicability to specific types of active attacks. In this work, we propose an anomaly detection (AD) model based on one-class machine learning to address active attacks targeting the receiver. By constructing a dataset from the QKD system's operational states, the AD model learns the characteristics of normal behavior under secure conditions. When an active attack occurs, the system's state deviates from the learned normal patterns and is identified as anomalous by the model. Experimental results show that the AD model achieves an area under the curve (AUC) exceeding 99%, effectively safeguarding the receiver of the QKD system. Compared to traditional approaches, our model can be deployed with minimal cost in existing QKD networks without requiring additional optical or electrical components, thus avoiding the introduction of new side channels. Furthermore, unlike multi-class machine learning algorithms, our approach does not rely on prior knowledge of specific attack types and is potentially able to detect unknown active attacks. These advantages-generality, ease of deployment, low cost, and high accuracy-make our model a practical and effective tool for protecting the receiver of QKD systems against active attacks.

TI Limitations of noisy quantum devices in computing and entangling power
SO NPJ QUANTUM INFORMATION
AB Finding solid and practical quantum advantages via noisy quantum devices without error correction is a critical but challenging problem. Conversely, comprehending the fundamental limitations of the state-of-the-art is equally crucial. In this work, we consider the class of strictly contractive unital noise and derive its analytical representation by decomposition. Under such noise, we observe the polynomial-time indistinguishability of n-qubit devices from random coins when circuit depths exceed Omega(log(n))\documentclass[12pt]{minimal} \usepackage{amsmath} \usepackage{wasysym} \usepackage{amsfonts} \usepackage{amssymb} \usepackage{amsbsy} \usepackage{mathrsfs} \usepackage{upgreek} \setlength{\oddsidemargin}{-69pt} \begin{document}$$\Omega (\log (n))$$\end{document}. Even with classical processing, we demonstrate the absence of computational advantage in polynomial-time algorithms with super-logarithmic noisy circuit depths. These results impact variational quantum algorithms, error mitigation, and quantum simulation with polynomial depth. Furthermore, we consider noisy quantum devices with a restricted gate topology. For one-dimensional noisy qubit circuits, we rule out super-polynomial quantum advantages in all-depth regimes. We also establish upper limits on entanglement generation: O(log(n))\documentclass[12pt]{minimal} \usepackage{amsmath} \usepackage{wasysym} \usepackage{amsfonts} \usepackage{amssymb} \usepackage{amsbsy} \usepackage{mathrsfs} \usepackage{upgreek} \setlength{\oddsidemargin}{-69pt} \begin{document}$$O(\log (n))$$\end{document} for one-dimensional circuits and O(nlog(n))\documentclass[12pt]{minimal} \usepackage{amsmath} \usepackage{wasysym} \usepackage{amsfonts} \usepackage{amssymb} \usepackage{amsbsy} \usepackage{mathrsfs} \usepackage{upgreek} \setlength{\oddsidemargin}{-69pt} \begin{document}$$O(\sqrt{n}\log (n))$$\end{document} for two-dimensional circuits. Our findings underscore the computational capacity and entanglement scalability constraints in noisy quantum devices.

TI Second-Quantized Fermionic Operators with Polylogarithmic Qubit and Gate
   Complexity
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB We present a method for encoding second-quantized fermionic systems in qubits when the number of fermions is conserved, as in the electronic structure problem. When the number F of fermions is much smaller than the number M of modes, this symmetry reduces the number of information-theoretically required qubits from Theta (M) to O(F log M). In this limit, our encoding requires O(F-2 log(4) M) qubits, while encoded fermionic creation and annihilation operators have cost O(F-2 log(5 )M) in two-qubit gates. When incorporated into randomized simulation methods, this permits simulating time evolution with only polylogarithmic explicit dependence on M. This is the first second-quantized encoding of fermions in qubits whose costs in qubits and gates are both polylogarithmic in M, which permits studying fermionic systems in the high-accuracy regime of many modes.

TI Let the quantum creep in: designing quantum neural network models by
   gradually swapping out classical components
SO QUANTUM MACHINE INTELLIGENCE
AB Artificial Intelligence (AI), with its multiplier effect and wide applications in multiple areas, could potentially be an important application of quantum computing. Since modern AI systems are often built on neural networks, the design of quantum neural networks becomes a key challenge in integrating quantum computing into AI. To provide a more fine-grained characterisation of the impact of quantum components on the performance of neural networks, we propose a framework where classical neural network layers are gradually replaced by quantum layers that have the same type of input and output while keeping the flow of information between layers unchanged, different from most current research in quantum neural network, which favours an end-to-end quantum model. We start with a simple three-layer classical neural network without any normalisation layers or activation functions and gradually change the classical layers to the corresponding quantum versions. We conduct numerical experiments on image classification datasets such as the MNIST, FashionMNIST, and CIFAR-10 datasets to demonstrate the change of performance brought by the systematic introduction of quantum components. Through this framework, our research sheds new light on the design of future quantum neural network models where it could be more favourable to search for methods and frameworks that harness the advantages from both the classical and quantum worlds.

TI Comment on "Dr. Bertlmann's Socks in a Quaternionic World of Ambidextral
   Reality"
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB I point out critical errors in the article "Dr. Bertlmann's Socks in a Quaternionic World of Ambidextral Reality" by J. Christian, published in IEEE ACCESS. Christian's model does not generate the singlet correlations but in fact simply reproduces the Bertlmann effect. John Bell's colleague Reinhold Bertlmann of CERN, in his younger days, always wore one pink and one blue sock, at random. The moment you saw his left foot, you knew what colour sock would be on his right foot. Action at a distance? As John Bell liked to explain, quantum entanglement cannot be explained away in such an easy way. Yet Christian's model assigns the two particles of the EPR-B experiment an equal and opposite spin at the source, the choice being determined by a fair coin toss. However they are measured, these spins are recovered. Christian's computer simulation works by not actually simulating his model at all but by almost directly tracing the negative cosine built into his computer algebra package. Bell's theorem has not been disproved. Debate as to what it means for the foundations of physics as well as for quantum information engineering (quantum communication, computation) is more lively today than ever before. A possible role for Geometric Algebra is still wide open and deserves further investigation, informed by a proper understanding of the mathematical content of Bell's theorem.

TI Braiding of Majorana bound states in a driven-dissipative Majorana box
   setup
SO NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB We investigate a system of Majorana box qubits, where each of the Coulomb blockaded boxes is driven by an applied AC voltage and is embedded in a dissipative environment. The AC voltage is applied between a pair of quantum dots, each of which is coupled by tunneling to a Majorana box qubit. Moreover, the dissipation is created by the coupling to an electromagnetic environment. Recent work has shown that in this case the Majorana bound states (MBSs) which form the computational basis can emerge as dark states, which are stabilized by the dissipation. In our work, we show that the same platform can be used to enable topological braiding of these dissipative MBSs. We show that coupling three such Majorana boxes allows a braiding transformation by changing the tunnel amplitudes adiabatically in time.

TI Stabilization of product states and excited-state quantum phase
   transitions in a coupled qubit-field system
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB We study a system of a single qubit (or a few qubits) interacting with a soft-mode bosonic field. Considering an extended version of the Rabi model with both parity-conserving and parity-violating interactions, we disclose a complex arrangement of quantum phase transitions in the ground-and excited-state domains. An experimentally testable signature of some of these transitions is a dynamical stabilization of a fully factorized qubit-field state involving the field vacuum. It happens in the ultrastrong coupling regime where the superradiant field equilibrium is far from the vacuum state. The degree of stabilization varies abruptly with interaction parameters and increases with the softness of the field mode. We analyze semiclassical origins of these effects and show their connection to various forms of excited-state quantum phase transitions.

TI Timing-Attack-Resistant Acceleration of NTRU Round 3 Encryption on
   Resource-Constrained Embedded Systems
SO CRYPTOGRAPHY
AB The advent of quantum computing with high processing capabilities will enable brute force attacks in short periods of time, threatening current secure communication channels. To mitigate this situation, post-quantum cryptography (PQC) algorithms have emerged. Among the algorithms evaluated by NIST in the third round of its PQC contest was the NTRU cryptosystem. The main drawback of this algorithm is the enormous amount of time required for the multiplication of polynomials in both the encryption and decryption processes. Therefore, the strategy of speeding up this algorithm using hardware/software co-design techniques where this operation is executed on specific hardware arises. Using these techniques, this work focuses on the acceleration of polynomial multiplication in the encryption process for resource-constrained devices. For this purpose, several hardware multiplications are analyzed following different strategies, taking into account the fact that there are no possible timing information leaks and that the available resources are optimized as much as possible. The designed multiplier is encapsulated as a fully reusable and parametrizable IP module with standard AXI4-Stream interconnection buses, which makes it easy to integrate into embedded systems implemented on programmable devices from different manufacturers. Depending on the resource constraints imposed, accelerations of up to 30-45 times with respect to the software-level multiplication runtime can be achieved using dedicated hardware, with a device occupancy of around 5%.

TI Benchmarking the Maritime Inventory Routing Problem on a Quantum
   Annealing-Hybrid System
SO TRANSNAV-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL ON MARINE NAVIGATION AND SAFETY OF SEA
   TRANSPORTATION
AB The maritime inventory routing problem (MIRP) is an optimization task aimed to increase the efficiency of the distribution of bulk products by sea. It combines the routing of a fleet of heterogeneous vessels between capacitated supplying and demanding ports with the inventory handling at the involved facilities. We consider a well-studied and general MILP-model variant and introduce modelling adaptations to reduce end-of-horizon effects. The primary goal is to investigate the capabilities and limitations of current large-scale quantum-based optimization platforms as a new solution method for MIRPs. We thus benchmark the computational performance of D-Wave's quantum-classical hybrid solver on our model by comparing it to results obtained with CPLEX as a classical state-of-the-art solution method. The test instances cover a range of different parameter scales, ranging from 2 to 4 ports, fleet size of 2 to 7 vessels and up to 45 discrete time periods. The benchmark results show that the hybrid system fails to find solutions in the same time as CPLEX for about half the problem instances. In particular, it struggles to explore tight solution spaces of larger instances. The hybrid solutions that were found vary in quality, averaging to about 65% to 75% of the classically computed objective values. For improved results we believe that the problem formulation needs to be changed to a regime better suited for the hybrid solver, e.g. by incorporating quadratic terms.

To numerically obtain the solutions to the many-body Schr & ouml;dinger equation, we employ the improved Exact Diagonalization method (Anh-Tai et al 2023 SciPost Phys. 15 048), which is capable of treating strongly-correlated few-body systems from first principles in an efficiently truncated Hilbert space. We present our comprehensive results for all possible combinations of intra- and interspecies interactions in the extreme limits that are either the ideal limit (g = 0) or close to the hard-core limit ( g ->infinity). These results show the emergence of unique ground-state properties related to correlations, coherence and spatial localization stemming from strongly repulsive interactions.

TI Majorana zero modes in multiplicative topological phases
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
AB Topological qubits composed of unpaired Majorana zero modes are under intense experimental and theoretical scrutiny in efforts to realize practical quantum computation schemes. In this work, we show that the minimum four unpaired Majorana zero modes required for a topological qubit according to braiding schemes and control of entanglement for gate operations are inherent to multiplicative topological phases, which realize symmetry-protected tensor products-and maximally entangled Bell states-of unpaired Majorana zero modes. We construct and characterize both one-dimensional and two-dimensional multiplicative topological phases with two parent Kitaev chain Hamiltonians. We furthermore characterize topology in the bulk and on the boundary with established methods while also introducing techniques to overcome challenges in characterizing multiplicative topology. In the process, we explore the potential of these multiplicative topological phases for an alternative to braiding-based topological quantum computation schemes, in which gate operations are performed through topological phase transitions.

TI A nonstabilizerness monotone from stabilizerness asymmetry
SO QUANTUM SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB We introduce a nonstabilizerness monotone which we name basis-minimized stabilizerness asymmetry (BMSA). It is based on the notion of G-asymmetry, a measure of how much a certain state deviates from being symmetric with respect to a symmetry group G. For pure states, we show that the BMSA is a strong monotone for magic-state resource theory, while it can be extended to mixed states via the convex roof construction. We discuss its relation with other magic monotones, first showing that the BMSA coincides with the recently introduced basis-minimized measurement entropy, thereby establishing the strong monotonicity of the latter. Next, we provide inequalities between the BMSA and other nonstabilizerness measures such as the robustness of magic, stabilizer extent, stabilizer rank, stabilizer fidelity and stabilizer R & eacute;nyi entropy. We also prove that the stabilizer fidelity, stabilizer R & eacute;nyi entropy and BMSA with index alpha >= 2 have the same asymptotic scaling with qubit number. Finally, we present numerical methods to compute the BMSA, highlighting its advantages and drawbacks compared to other nonstabilizerness measures in the context of pure many-body quantum states. We also discuss the importance of additivity and strong monotonicity for measures of nonstabilizerness in many-body physics, motivating the search for additional computable nonstabilizerness monotones.

TI Practical, high-speed Gaussian coherent state continuous variable
   quantum key distribution with real-time parameter monitoring, optimised
   slicing, and post-processed key distillation
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB Gaussian coherent state continuous variable quantum key distribution has gained interest owing to its security and compatibility with classical coherent optical fibre networks. For successful system deployment it is necessary to implement practical high speed systems which distil keys efficiently. Here, we demonstrate a Gaussian coherent state continuous variable quantum key distribution system at a 50 MHz symbol rate. Unlike most demonstrations to date which measure excess noise and infer key rates from this, we record signals in real time and distil keys. We also demonstrate, for the first time, slice reconciliation with optimised guard bands to maximise achievable secret key rates. Using this optimisation with multilevel slicing, a record 5 Mb/s secret key rate after a transmission distance of 25 km is achieved. This is a significant improvement on the 3 Mb/s secret key rate which is achieved with single level optimised slice reconciliation.

TI Scalable Method for Eliminating Residual ZZ Interaction between
   Superconducting Qubits
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB Unwanted ZZ interaction is a quantum-mechanical crosstalk phenomenon which correlates qubit dynamics and is ubiquitous in superconducting qubit systems. It adversely affects the quality of quantum operations and can be detrimental in scalable quantum information processing. Here we propose and experimentally demonstrate a practically extensible approach for complete cancellation of residual ZZ interaction between fixed-frequency transmon qubits, which are known for long coherence and simple control. We apply to the intermediate coupler that connects the qubits a weak microwave drive at a properly chosen frequency in order to noninvasively induce an ac Stark shift for ZZ cancellation. We verify the cancellation performance by measuring vanishing two-qubit entangling phases and ZZ correlations. In addition, we implement a randomized benchmarking experiment to extract the idling gate fidelity which shows good agreement with the coherence limit, demonstrating the effectiveness of ZZ cancellation. Our method allows independent addressability of each qubit-qubit connection and is applicable to both nontunable and tunable couplers, promising better compatibility with future large-scale quantum processors.

TI A Quantum-Classical Collaborative Training Architecture Based on Quantum
   State Fidelity
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON QUANTUM ENGINEERING
AB Recent advancements have highlighted the limitations of current quantum systems, particularly the restricted number of qubits available on near-term quantum devices. This constraint greatly inhibits the range of applications that can leverage quantum computers. Moreover, as the available qubits increase, the computational complexity grows exponentially, posing additional challenges. Consequently, there is an urgent need to use qubits efficiently and mitigate both present limitations and future complexities. To address this, existing quantum applications attempt to integrate classical and quantum systems in a hybrid framework. In this article, we concentrate on quantum deep learning and introduce a collaborative classical-quantum architecture called co-TenQu. The classical component employs a tensor network for compression and feature extraction, enabling higher dimensional data to be encoded onto logical quantum circuits with limited qubits. On the quantum side, we propose a quantum-state-fidelity-based evaluation function to iteratively train the network through a feedback loop between the two sides. co-TenQu has been implemented and evaluated with both simulators and the IBM-Q platform. Compared to state-of-the-art approaches, co-TenQu enhances a classical deep neural network by up to 41.72% in a fair setting. In addition, it outperforms other quantum-based methods by up to 1.9 times and achieves similar accuracy while utilizing 70.59% fewer qubits.

TI Quantum data generation in a denoising model with multiscale
   entanglement renormalization network
SO PHYSICA SCRIPTA
AB Quantum technology has entered the era of noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) information processing. The technological revolution of machine learning represented by generative models heralds a great prospect of artificial intelligence, and the huge amount of data processes poses a big challenge to existing computers. The generation of large quantities of quantum data will be a challenge for quantum artificial intelligence. In this work, we present an efficient noise-resistant quantum data generation method that can be applied to various types of NISQ quantum processors, where the target quantum data belongs to a certain class and our proposal enables the generation of various quantum data belonging to the target class. Specifically, we propose a quantum denoising probability model (QDM) based on a multiscale entanglement renormalization network (MERA) for the generation of quantum data. To show the feasibility and practicality of our scheme, we demonstrate the generations of the classes of GHZ-like states and W-like states with a success rate above 99%. Our MREA QDM can also be used to denoise multiple types of quantum data simultaneously. We show the success rate of denoising both GHZ-like and W-like states with single qubit noise environment of noise level within 1/4 can approximate to be 100%, and with two other types of noise environment with noise level within 1/4 can be above 90%. Our quantum data generation scheme provides new ideas and prospects for quantum generative models in the NISQ era.

TI High-purity pulsed squeezing generation with integrated photonics
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Squeezed light has evolved into a powerful tool for quantum technology, ranging from quantum-enhanced sensing and quantum-state engineering based on partial postselection techniques. The pulsed generation of squeezed light is of particular interest, as it can provide accurate time stamps and a physically defined temporal mode, which are highly preferred in complex communication networks and large-scale information processing. However, the multimode feature of pulsed squeezing limits the purity of the output state, negatively impacting its application in quantum technology. Previous demonstrations and analysis of pulsed squeezing focus on single-pass configurations and synchronously pumped free-space cavities. In this paper, we propose a different approach to generate pulsed squeezing with high temporal purity, where a parametric down-conversion process in integrated photonic cavities is pumped by a single-pass pulse. We show that the effective mode number of the output pulsed squeezing approaches unity. Such a high-purity squeezed light can be realized with broad parameters and a low pump power, providing a robust approach to generating large-scale quantum resources.

TI Classical algorithms for many-body quantum systems at finite energies
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
AB We investigate quantum-inspired algorithms to compute physical observables of quantum many-body systems at finite energies. They are based on the quantum algorithms proposed by S. Lu, M. C. Ba??uls, and J. I. Cirac [PRX Quantum 2, 020321 (2021)], who use the quantum simulation of the dynamics of such systems, as well as classical filtering and sampling techniques. Here, we replace the quantum simulation by standard classical methods based on matrix product states and operators. As a result, we can address significantly larger systems than those reachable by exact diagonalization or by other algorithms. We demonstrate the performance with spin chains up to 80 sites.

TI Visibility Stokes parameters as a foundation for quantum information
   science with undetected photons
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB The framework of measurement operators plays a fundamental role in extracting information about quantum systems. Recently, techniques based on induced coherence have been developed to access the same information for undetected photons. However, there has been a lack of consistent reformulation of quantum operators for these techniques. In this work, we introduce a set of parameters that quantify the polarization of undetected photons based on measured visibilities. Given their similarity to classical counterparts, we refer to them as visibility Stokes parameters. We apply these parameters and the corresponding quantum operators to the problem of quantum state tomography, thoroughly analyzing the environment of undetected photons and its role in the reconstruction process. Because these parameters provide a more intuitive and consistent understanding of the measurement process, we believe that some established quantum information protocols could be adapted for undetected photons.

TI On Entanglement Assisted Classical Optical Communication With

SO IEEE ACCESS
AB Entanglement assisted (EA) communication has been advocated by numerous authors as a potential alternative to classical communications, in particular in noisy and low-brightness regime. In this paper, I propose an EA scheme employing the optical phase-conjugation (OPC) on transmitter side. I show that the proposed EA communication system, with the transmitter side OPC, significantly outperforms its classical counterpart in low-brightness and highly noisy regime, while employing a classical coherent detection scheme for two-dimensional demodulation. Moreover, the capacity of the proposed EA scheme is significantly higher than EA repetition-BPSK, homodyne, heterodyne, and Holevo capacities. Finally, the proposed EA scheme outperforms the corresponding EA scheme with OPC placed on a receiver side.

TI Emulation of Density Matrix Dynamics With Classical Analog Circuits
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON QUANTUM ENGINEERING
AB Analog circuits have emerged as a valuable quantum emulation and simulation platform. Specifically, they have been experimentally shown to excel in emulating coherent state vector dynamics and motifs of quantum circuits, such as the quantum Fourier transform, tensor product superpositions, two-level systems such as Josephson junctions, and nuclear magnetic resonance state dynamics, all on a very large scale integration chip at room temperature (Cressman et al., 2022; Sarpeshkar, 2019a, 2019b, 2019c; Sarpeshkar, 2020). However, the ability to model simple state vectors is insufficient for modeling open quantum systems, i.e., systems with environmental noise. Noisy quantum systems are essential in practical implementations and applications that exploit noise. The density matrix formalism enables us to model such states, including finite reservoir state systems, and all states that can be represented as state vectors. To our knowledge, no one has yet demonstrated the mapping of a density matrix system to classical analog circuit components. We review the procedure for emulating the dynamics of a finite state vector with four essential analog circuit components and extend this procedure to emulate density matrix dynamics. We then simulate these systems as analog circuits in the presence of noise. This protocol opens up exciting possibilities for further research and development in noisy quantum emulation and simulation using analog circuits for arbitrarily large or small systems.

AB Shor's algorithm is a well-known probabilistic method for factoring large composite integers in polynomial-time on a quantum computer. The method computes the order r of a random element x in the group Z(N)* and uses that information for splitting N with an application of the greatest common divisor algorithm. However, being probabilistic, the success of Shor's algorithm relies on some special properties of N. If r is even and x(r/2) not equivalent to -1 mod N, then gcd(x(r/2) - 1, N) reveals a nontrivial factor of N and the method succeeds. But even assuming that r is even and being given the complete prime factorization of N it is not obvious whether x(r/2) not equivalent to -1 mod N and, therefore, it is not easy to assert whether Shor's algorithm would split N without running it and looking at its answer. We present a strategy for detecting whether the splitting occurs without any need for running the quantum order-finding algorithm, but we must be given the prime factorization of N. This has allowed us to produce the first direct evidence of the probability of success of Shor's method. The composites chosen were the product of two randomly -generated probable primes of similar sizes that pass the Miller-Rabin test. (C) 2021 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB Recently, Renes proposed a quantum algorithm called belief propagation with quantum messages (BPQM) for decoding classical data encoded using a binary linear code with tree Tanner graph that is transmitted over a pure-state classical-quantum channel [1]. The algorithm presents a genuine quantum counterpart to decoding based on the classical belief propagation algorithm, which has found wide success in classical coding theory when used in conjunction with LDPC or Turbo codes. Here we significantly expand the understanding, formalism, and applicability of the BPQM algorithm with the following contributions. First, we prove analytically that BPQM realizes optimal decoding for any binary linear code with tree Tanner graph. We also provide the first formal description of the BPQM algorithm in full detail and without any ambiguity. In so doing, we identify a key flaw overlooked in the original algorithm which causes quantum circuit realizations to be exponentially large in the code size. We remedy this problem by formulating a truly message-passing algorithm which approximates BPQM and has circuit complexity O(poly n, polylog 1/epsilon), where n is the code length and epsilon is the approximation error. Finally, we also propose a novel method for extending BPQM to factor graphs containing cycles by making use of approximate cloning.

TI Deep reinforcement learning-based routing and resource assignment in
   quantum key distribution-secured optical networks
SO IET QUANTUM COMMUNICATION
AB In quantum key distribution-secured optical networks (QKD-ONs), constrained network resources limit the success probability of QKD lightpath requests (QLRs). Thus, the selection of an appropriate route and the efficient utilisation of network resources for establishment of QLRs are the essential and challenging problems. This work addresses the routing and resource assignment (RRA) problem in the quantum signal channel of QKD-ONs. The RRA problem of QKD-ONs is a complex decision making problem, where appropriate solutions depend on understanding the networking environment. Motivated by the recent advances in deep reinforcement learning (DRL) for complex problems and also because of its capability to learn directly from experiences, DRL is exploited to solve the RRA problem and a DRL-based RRA scheme is proposed. The proposed scheme learns the optimal policy to select an appropriate route and assigns suitable network resources for establishment of QLRs by using deep neural networks. The performance of the proposed scheme is compared with the deep-Q network (DQN) method and two baseline schemes, namely, first-fit (FF) and random-fit (RF) for two different networks, namely The National Science Foundation Network (NSFNET) and UBN24. Simulation results indicate that the proposed scheme reduces blocking by 7.19%, 10.11%, and 33.50% for NSFNET and 2.47%, 3.20%, and 19.60% for UBN24 and improves resource utilisation up to 3.40%, 4.33%, and 7.18% for NSFNET and 1.34%, 1.96%, and 6.44% for UBN24 as compared with DQN, FF, and RF, respectively.
   This work addresses the routing and resource assignment problem in QKD-secured optical networks, explores the deep reinforcement learning (DRL) method, and proposes a DRL-based routing and resource assignment scheme. Simulation results indicate that the proposed scheme outperforms the baseline schemes in terms of blocking probability and resource utilisation.image

TI Quantum communications in continuous variable systems
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF QUANTUM INFORMATION
AB Nowadays, quantum communications provide a vast field of research in rapid expansion, with a huge potential impact on the future developments of quantum technologies. In particular, continuous variable systems, employing coherent-state encoding and quadrature measurements, represent a suitable platform, due to their compatibility with both the modulation and detection systems currently employed in standard fiber-optical communications. In this work, we address some relevant aspects of the field, and provide innovative results being also experimentally oriented. In particular, we focus on two relevant paradigms: quantum decision theory and continuous variable quantum key distribution (CVQKD). In the former case, we address the problem of coherent-state discrimination and design new hybrid receivers for binary phase-shift keying discrimination, obtaining a quantum advantage over conventional detection schemes, being also robust against typical experimental imperfections. In the latter scenario, we proceed in two different directions. On the one hand, we design new CVQKD protocols employing discrete modulation of coherent states, being a feasible solution compatible with the state of the art in optical communications technologies. On the other hand, we address the more fundamental problem of performing channel losses mitigation to enhance existing protocols, and investigate the role of optical amplifiers for the task. Finally, we make a first step towards a fully non-Gaussian CVQKD scheme by proposing, for the first time, the adoption of an optimized state-discrimination receiver, commonly adopted for quantum decision theory, within the context of CVQKD, obtaining a genuine quantum enhancement over conventional protocols.

TI Comparison of Lumped Oscillator Model and Energy Participation Ratio
   Methods in Designing Two-Dimensional Superconducting Quantum Chips
SO ENTROPY
AB Over the past two decades, superconducting quantum circuits have become one of the essential platforms for realizing quantum computers. The Hamiltonian of a superconducting quantum circuit system is the key to describing the dynamic evolution of the system. For this reason, various methods for analyzing the Hamiltonian of a superconducting quantum circuit system have been proposed, among which the LOM (Lumped Oscillator Model) and the EPR (Energy Participation Ratio) methods are the most popular ones. To analyze and improve the design methods of superconducting quantum chips, this paper compares the similarities and differences of the LOM and the EPR quantification methods. We verify the applicability of these two theoretical approaches to the design of 2D transmon quantum chips. By comparing the theoretically simulated results and the experimentally measured data at extremely low temperature, the errors between the theoretical calculation and observed measurement values of the two methods were summarized. Results show that the LOM method has more parameter outputs in data diversity and the qubit frequency calculation in LOM is more accurate. The reason is that in LOM more coupling between different systems are taken into consideration. These analyses would have reference significance for the design of superconducting quantum chips.

TI Engineering of niobium surfaces through accelerated neutral atom beam
   technology for quantum applications
SO JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYSICS
AB A major roadblock to scalable quantum computing is phase decoherence and energy relaxation caused by qubits interacting with defect-related two-level systems (TLSs). Native oxides present on the surfaces of superconducting metals used in quantum devices are acknowledged to be a source of TLS that decrease qubit coherence times. Reducing microwave loss by "surface engineering" (i.e., replacing the uncontrolled native oxide of superconducting metals with a thin, stable surface with predictable characteristics) can be a key enabler for pushing performance forward with devices of higher intrinsic quality factor. In this work, we present a novel approach to replace the native oxide of niobium (typically formed in an uncontrolled fashion when its pristine surface is exposed to air) with an engineered oxide, using a room-temperature process that leverages accelerated neutral atom beam (ANAB) technology at 300 mm wafer scale. This ANAB is composed of a mixture of argon and oxygen, with tunable energy per atom, which is rastered across the wafer surface. The ANAB-engineered Nb-oxide thickness was found to vary from 2 to 6 nm depending on ANAB process parameters. The modeling of variable-energy x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy data confirms the thickness and compositional control of Nb surface oxide by the ANAB process. These results correlate well with those from transmission electron microscopy and x-ray reflectometry. Since ANAB is broadly applicable to material surfaces, the present study indicates its promise for modification of the surfaces of superconducting quantum circuits to achieve longer coherence times.

TI Geometric representations of braid and Yang-Baxter gates
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICS A-MATHEMATICAL AND THEORETICAL
AB Brick-wall circuits composed of the Yang-Baxter gates are integrable. It becomes an important tool to study the quantum many-body system out of equilibrium. To put the Yang-Baxter gate on quantum computers, it has to be decomposed into the native gates of quantum computers. It is favorable to apply the least number of native two-qubit gates to construct the Yang-Baxter gate. We study the geometric representations of all X-type braid gates and their corresponding Yang-Baxter gates via the Yang-Baxterization. We find that the braid and Yang-Baxter gates can only exist on certain edges and faces of the two-qubit tetrahedron. We identify the parameters by which the braid and Yang-Baxter gates are the Clifford gate, the matchgate, and the dual-unitary gate. The geometric representations provide the optimal decompositions of the braid and Yang-Baxter gates in terms of other two-qubit gates. We also find that the entangling powers of the Yang-Baxter gates are determined by the spectral parameters. Our results provide the necessary conditions to construct the braid and Yang-Baxter gates on quantum computers.

TI An exchange coupled meso-meso linked vanadyl porphyrin
   dimer for quantum information processing
SO CHEMICAL SCIENCE
AB We report here the synthesis of a new meso-meso (m-m) singly linked vanadyl-porphyrin dimer that crystallizes in two different pseudo-polymorphs. The single crystal continuous-wave electron paramagnetic resonance investigation evidences a small but crucial isotropic exchange interaction, J, between the two tilted, and thus distinguishable, spin centers of the order of 10(-2) cm(-1). The experimental and DFT studies evidence a correlation between J values and porphyrin plane tilting angle and distortion. Pulsed EPR analysis shows that the two vanadyl dimers maintain the coherence time of the monomer. With the obtained spin Hamiltonian parameters, we identify suitable transitions that could be used as computational basis states. Our results, coupled with the evaporability of porphyrin systems, establish this class of dimers as extremely promising for quantum information processing applications.

TI Readout using resonant tunneling in silicon spin qubits
SO JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYSICS
AB Spin qubit systems are one of the promising candidates for quantum computing. The quantum dot (QD) arrays are intensively investigated by many researchers. Because the energy-difference between the up-spin and down-spin states is very small, the detection of the qubit state is of prime importance in this field. Moreover, many wires are required to control qubit systems. Therefore, the integration of qubits and wires is also an important issue. In this study, the measurement process of QD arrays is theoretically investigated using resonant tunneling, controlled by a conventional transistor. It is shown that the number of possible measurements during coherence time can exceed a hundred under the backaction of the measurements owing to the nonlinear characteristics of resonant tunneling. It is also discussed to read out the measurement results by the conventional transistor.(c) 2023 Author(s).

TI Energy exchange and fluctuations between a dissipative qubit and a
   monitor under continuous measurement and feedback
SO SCIPOST PHYSICS CORE
AB Continuous quantum measurement and feedback induce energy exchange between a dissipative qubit and a monitor even in the steady state, as a measurement backaction. Using the Lindblad equation, we identified the maximum and minimum values of the steady-state energy flow as the measurement and feedback states vary, and we demonstrate the qubit cooling induced by these processes. Turning our attention to quantum trajectories under continuous measurement and feedback, we observe that the energy flow fluctuates around the steady-state values. We reveal that the fluctuations are strongly influenced by the measurement backaction, distinguishing them from the standard Poisson noise typically observed in electronic circuits. Our results offer potential application in the development of quantum refrigerators controlled by continuous measurement and feedback, and provide deep insight into quantum thermodynamics from the perspective of fluctuation.

TI Non-Clifford gate on optical qubits by nonlinear feedforward
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB In a continuous-variable optical system, the Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill (GKP) qubit is a promising candidate for fault-tolerant quantum computation. To implement non-Clifford operations on GKP qubits, non-Gaussian operations are required. In this context, the implementation of a cubic phase gate by combining nonlinear feedforward with ancillary states has been widely researched. Recently, however, it was pointed out that the cubic phase gate is not the most suitable for non-Clifford operations on GKP qubits. In this paper, we show that we can achieve linear optical implementation of non-Clifford operations on GKP qubits with high fidelity by applying the nonlinear feedforward originally developed for the cubic phase gate and using a GKP-encoded ancillary state. Our paper shows the versatility of the nonlinear feedforward technique-important for optical implementation of the fault-tolerant continuous-variable quantum computation.

TI New Constructions of Approximately Mutually Unbiased Bases by Character
   Sums over Galois Rings
SO IEICE TRANSACTIONS ON FUNDAMENTALS OF ELECTRONICS COMMUNICATIONS AND
   COMPUTER SCIENCES
AB Mutually unbiased bases (MUBs) are widely used in quantum information processing and play an important role in quantum cryptography, quantum state tomography and communications. It's diffi- ffi- cult to construct MUBs and remains unknown whether complete MUBs exist for any non prime power. Therefore, researchers have proposed the solution to construct approximately mutually unbiased bases (AMUBs) by weakening the inner product conditions. This paper constructs q AMUBs of Cq, q , (q q + 1) AMUBs of C q -1 and q AMUBs of C q -1 by using character sums over Galois rings and finite fields, where q is a power of a prime. The first construction of q AMUBs of Cq q is new which illustrates K AMUBs of CK K can be achieved. The second and third constructions in this paper include the partial results about AMUBs constructed by W. Wang et al. in [9].

TI Fabrication of thin diamond membranes by Ne
SO GIANT
AB Color centers in diamond are one of the most promising tools for quantum information science. Of particular interest is the use of single -crystal diamond membranes with nanoscale-thickness as hosts for color centers. Indeed, such structures guarantee a better integration with a variety of other quantum materials or devices, which can aid the development of diamond -based quantum technologies, from nanophotonics to quantum sensing. A common approach for membrane production is what is known as "smart -cut", a process where membranes are exfoliated from a diamond substrate after the creation of a thin sub -surface amorphous carbon layer by He+ implantation. Due to the high ion fluence required, this process can be time-consuming. In this work, we demonstrated the production of thin diamond membranes by neon implantation of diamond substrates. With the target of obtaining membranes of similar to 200 nm thickness and finding the critical damage threshold, we implanted different diamonds with 300 keV Ne+ ions at different fluences. We characterized the structural properties of the implanted diamonds and the resulting membranes through SEM, Raman spectroscopy, and photoluminescence spectroscopy. We also found that a SRIM model based on a two -layer diamond/sp2-carbon target better describes ion implantation, allowing us to estimate the diamond critical damage threshold for Ne+ implantation. Compared to He+ smart -cut, the use of a heavier ion like Ne+ results in a ten -fold decrease in the ion fluence required to obtain diamond membranes and allows to obtain shallower smart -cuts, i.e. thinner membranes, at the same ion energy.

TI From Nano to Quantum: Ethics Through a Lens of Continuity
SO SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING ETHICS
AB A significant amount of scholarship and funding has been dedicated to ethical and social studies of new and emerging science and technology (NEST), from nanotechnology to synthetic biology, and Artificial Intelligence. Quantum technologies comprise the latest NEST attracting interest from scholarship in the social sciences and humanities. While there is a small community now emerging around broader discussion of quantum technologies in society, the concepts of ethics of quantum technologies and responsible innovation are still fluid. In this article, we argue that lessons from previous instances of NEST can offer important insights into the early stages of quantum technology discourse and development. In the embryonic stages of discourse around NEST, there is often an undue emphasis on the novelty of ethical issues, leading to speculation and misplaced resources and energy. Using a lens of continuity, we revisit experiences and lessons from nanotechnology discourse. Zooming in on key characteristics of the nanoethics discourse, we use these features as analytical tools with which to assess and analyse emerging discourse around quantum technologies. We point to continuities between nano and quantum discourse, including the focus on 'responsible' or 'good' technology; the intensification of ethical issues brought about by enabling technologies; the limitations and risks of speculative ethics; the effects of ambivalence on the framing of ethics; and the importance of paying attention to the present. These issues are taken forward to avoid 'reinventing the wheel' and to offer guidance in shaping the ethics discourse around quantum technologies into a more focused and effective debate.

TI Group-theoretic error mitigation enabled by classical shadows and
   symmetries
SO NPJ QUANTUM INFORMATION
AB Estimating expectation values is a key subroutine in quantum algorithms. Near-term implementations face two major challenges: a limited number of samples required to learn a large collection of observables, and the accumulation of errors in devices without quantum error correction. To address these challenges simultaneously, we develop a quantum error-mitigation strategy called symmetry-adjusted classical shadows, by adjusting classical-shadow tomography according to how symmetries are corrupted by device errors. As a concrete example, we highlight global U(1) symmetry, which manifests in fermions as particle number and in spins as total magnetization, and illustrate their group-theoretic unification with respective classical-shadow protocols. We establish rigorous sampling bounds under readout errors obeying minimal assumptions, and perform numerical experiments with a more comprehensive model of gate-level errors derived from existing quantum processors. Our results reveal symmetry-adjusted classical shadows as a low-cost strategy to mitigate errors from noisy quantum experiments in the ubiquitous presence of symmetry.

TI Quantum sensing of matter waves using BEC oscillations
SO RESULTS IN PHYSICS
AB Detecting matter waves in modern atom circuits is one of the most important operations for feasible applications. Here, we propose a sensor to monitor matter waves in atom circuits. The operation of this sensor is based on the interaction between two different Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) species in which one of the species is non-self-interacting and is restricted to perform coherent oscillations between the non-central wells of a triple-well potential (TWP). The detection, in the atom circuit to be monitored, occurs when the central well of the TWP is coupled to the circuit. Here, to simulate the regular operation of an atom circuit, we consider BEC matter waves propagating along a ring-shaped optical lattice (OL). We demonstrate numerically and analytically that this coupling leads to a variation of the BEC-oscillation period due to matter waves transiting the sensor. In particular, we show that small fluctuations of the matter waves can be detected by the variations of the BEC-oscillation period. As an example, by using a time-frequency wavelet analysis of the evolution of the population imbalance between the non-central wells of the sensor, we show the feasibility of coherent BEC oscillations to detect and accurately scan bright solitons moving in the ring-shaped OL.

TI Noisy quantum simulation: Performance and resource considerations for
   the Tavis-Cummings and Heisenberg models
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Fault-tolerant quantum computers promise the simulation of complex quantum systems beyond the reach of classical computation. In contrast, current noisy intermediate-scale quantum devices are constrained by hardware noise. Consequently, quantum simulation methods remain limited in their near-term applicability. Two prominent techniques addressing these challenges are zero-noise extrapolation (ZNE) and incremental structural learning (ISL). In this work, ZNE and ISL are benchmarked for simulating the Trotterized time evolution of two models: the Tavis-Cummings model (TCM) and the Heisenberg spin chain (HSC), using a classically simulated noisy hardware backend. The methods are evaluated on the basis of the accuracy of expectation values relative to noiseless simulations and their resource demands such as circuit depths and shot counts. The impact of noise on optimization routines in ISL, previously underexplored, is also investigated. Results indicate that ISL performs more favorably in HSC systems, consistently surpassing ZNE in expectation value accuracy. Conversely, for the TCM, ISL generally yields lower accuracies despite reduced Trotter circuit depths, with weak interactions often leading to pronounced phase lags or flat expectation curves. Notably, when performing ISL optimization under noiseless conditions, the protocol is generally able to reduce dephasing errors, but average accuracies still vary on the simulated Hamiltonian. Our findings highlight the sensitivity of quantum simulation protocols to the structure of the Hamiltonian encoding system dynamics. Trends across systems suggest that ISL optimization benefits from Trotter circuits with stronger interactions, and that ansatz construction favors isotropic couplings. Moreover, although ISL introduces approximation errors, it demonstrates greater robustness than ZNE in systems with deeper Trotter circuits.

TI Fitting quantum noise models to tomography data
SO QUANTUM
AB The presence of noise is currently one of the main obstacles to achieving large-scale quantum computation. Strategies to characterise and understand noise processes in quantum hardware are a critical part of mitigating it, especially as the overhead of full error correction and fault-tolerance is beyond the reach of current hardware. Non-Markovian effects are a particularly unfavourable type of noise, being both harder to analyse using standard techniques and more difficult to control using error correction. In this work we develop a set of efficient algorithms, based on the rigorous mathematical theory of Markovian master equations, to analyse and evaluate unknown noise processes. In the case of dynamics consistent with Markovian evolution, our algorithm outputs the best-fit Lindbladian, i.e., the generator of a memoryless quantum channel which best approximates the tomographic data to within the given precision. In the case of non-Markovian dynamics, our algorithm returns a quantitative and operationally meaningful measure of non-Markovianity in terms of isotropic noise addition. We provide a Python implementation of all our algorithms, and benchmark these on a range of 1- and 2-qubit examples of synthesised noisy tomography data, generated using the Cirq platform. The numerical results show that our algorithms succeed both in extracting a full description of the best-fit Lindbladian to the measured dynamics, and in computing accurate values of non-Markovianity that match analytical calculations.

TI Simulating open quantum systems with molecular spin qudits
SO MATERIALS HORIZONS
AB Noise affecting quantum processors still limits quantum simulations to a small number of units and operations. This is especially true for the simulation of open quantum systems, which involve additional units and operations to map environmental degrees of freedom. Hence, finding efficient approaches for the simulation of open quantum systems is an open issue. In this work, we demonstrate how using units with d > 2 levels (qudits) results in a reduction of up to two orders of magnitude in the number of operations (gates) required to implement state-of-the-art algorithms. We explore two conceptually distinct families of these algorithms that were initially designed for qubits and discuss the gate complexity scaling that different platforms (qubit-based vs. qudit-based) offer. Additionally, we present realistic simulations of an experimental platform based on molecular spin qudits coupled to superconducting resonators, where the main hardware error sources are included. We show that, in all cases considered, the use of qudits leads to a remarkable reduction in circuit complexity and that molecular nanomagnets are ideal qudit hosts.

TI Phase-quadrature quantum imaging with undetected photons
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB Sensing with undetected photons allows access to spectral regions with simultaneous detection of photons of another region and is based on nonlinear interferometry. To obtain the full information of a sample, the corresponding interferogram has to be analyzed in terms of amplitude and phase, which has been realized so far by multiple measurements followed by phase variation. Here, we present a polarization-optics-based phase-quadrature implementation in a nonlinear interferometer for imaging with undetected photons in the infrared region. This allows us to obtain phase and visibility with a single image acquisition without the need of varying optical paths or phases, thus enabling the detection of dynamic processes. We demonstrate the usefulness of our method on a static phase mask opaque to the detected photons as well as on dynamic measurement tasks as the drying of an isopropanol film and the stretching of an adhesive tape.

TI Molecular Polaritons for Chemistry, Photonics and Quantum Technologies
SO CHEMICAL REVIEWS
AB Molecular polaritons are quasiparticles resulting from the hybridization between molecular and photonic modes. These composite entities, bearing characteristics inherited from both constituents, exhibit modified energy levels and wave functions, thereby capturing the attention of chemists in the past decade. The potential to modify chemical reactions has spurred many investigations, alongside efforts to enhance and manipulate optical responses for photonic and quantum applications. This Review centers on the experimental advances in this burgeoning field. Commencing with an introduction of the fundamentals, including theoretical foundations and various cavity architectures, we discuss outcomes of polariton-modified chemical reactions. Furthermore, we navigate through the ongoing debates and uncertainties surrounding the underpinning mechanism of this innovative method of controlling chemistry. Emphasis is placed on gaining a comprehensive understanding of the energy dynamics of molecular polaritons, in particular, vibrational molecular polaritons & horbar;a pivotal facet in steering chemical reactions. Additionally, we discuss the unique capability of coherent two-dimensional spectroscopy to dissect polariton and dark mode dynamics, offering insights into the critical components within the cavity that alter chemical reactions. We further expand to the potential utility of molecular polaritons in quantum applications as well as precise manipulation of molecular and photonic polarizations, notably in the context of chiral phenomena. This discussion aspires to ignite deeper curiosity and engagement in revealing the physics underpinning polariton-modified molecular properties, and a broad fascination with harnessing photonic environments to control chemistry.

TI A Novel Continuous-Variable Quantum Key Distribution Scheme Based on
   Multi-Dimensional Multiplexing Technology
SO APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL
AB Dual-polarization division multiplexing (DPDM) is considered to be a potential method to boost the secure key rate (SKR) of the continuous-variable quantum key distribution (CV-QKD) system. In this article, we propose a pilot alternately assisted local local oscillator (LLO) CV-QKD scheme based on multi-dimensional multiplexing, where time division multiplexing and frequency division multiplexing are combined with dual-polarization multiplexing techniques to dramatically isolate the quantum signal from the pilot tone. We establish a general excess noise model for the LLO CV-QKD system to analyze the influence mechanism of various disturbances (e.g., time-domain diffusion, frequency-domain modulation residual, and polarization perturbation) on the key parameters, such as the channel transmittance and excess noise. Specifically, the photon leakage noise from the reference path to the quantum path and that between quantum signals with two different polarization paths are simultaneously analyzed in the dual-polarization LLO CV-QKD scheme for the first time. Furthermore, a series of simulations are established to verify the performance of the proposed scheme. The results show that the maximal isolation degree achieves 84.0 dB similar to 90.4 dB, and the crosstalk between pilot tones and quantum signals can be suppressed to a very small range. By optimizing the system parameters (e.g., modulation variance and repetition frequency), the SKR with 12.801 Mbps@25 km is achieved under the infinite polarization extinction ratio (PER) and 30 dB residual ratio of the frequency modulation in the nanosecond-level pulse width. Moreover, the performance of the proposed DPDM CV-QKD scheme under relatively harsh conditions is simulated; the results show that the SKR with 1.02 Mbps@25 km is achieved under a relatively low PER of 17 dB with the nanosecond-level pulse width and 20 dB residual ratio of the frequency modulation. Our work lays an important theoretical foundation for the practical DPDM LLO CV-QKD system.

TI Generation of optomicrowave and optomagnonic entanglements in cascaded
   optomagnomechanical systems
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB The optomagnomechanical system, which involves flexible nonlinearities, is one of the promising physical platforms for studying the preparation and manipulation of quantum entanglements, as well as the construction of hybrid quantum networks. A scheme for entanglement enhancement and quadripartite entanglement generation is proposed, based on a cascaded optomagnomechanical system. On the one hand, optomicrowave and optomagnonic entanglements within the two subsystems are investigated, and their parameter dependence, such as detuning, decay, coupling strength, transmission efficiency, and temperature is discussed. On the other hand, the parameter conditions for achieving optimal optomicrowave and optomagnonic quadripartite entanglements are also obtained. The results show that significant enhancement of optomicrowave and optomagnonic entanglements in the second cavity can be obtained in a certain range of parameters. Under optimized parameter conditions, optomicrowave and optomagnonic quadripartite entanglements can be generated throughout the entire cascaded system. This research provides a theoretical basis for the manipulation of quantum entanglement, the transmission of the magnon's state, and the construction of hybrid quantum networks involving different physical systems.

TI Des-q: a quantum algorithm to provably speedup retraining of decision
   trees
SO QUANTUM
AB Decision trees are widely adopted machine learning models due to their simplicity and explainability. However, as training data size grows, standard methods become increasingly slow, scaling polynomially with the number of training examples. In this work, we introduce Des-q, a novel quantum algorithm to construct and retrain decision trees for regression and binary classification tasks. Assuming the data stream produces small, periodic increments of new training examples, Des- q significantly reduces the tree retraining time. Des-q achieves a logarithmic complexity in the combined total number of old and new examples, even accounting for the time needed to load the new samples into quantum-accessible memory. Our approach to grow the tree from any given node involves performing piecewise linear splits to generate multiple hyperplanes, thus partitioning the input feature space into distinct regions. To determine the suitable anchor points for these splits, we develop an efficient quantum-supervised clustering method, building upon the qmeans algorithm introduced by Kerenidis et al. We benchmark the simulated version of Des-q against the state-of-the-art classical methods on multiple data sets and observe that our algorithm exhibits similar performance to the state-of-the-art decision trees while significantly speeding up the periodic tree retraining.

TI Experimental Masking of Real Quantum States
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW APPLIED
AB Masking of quantum information is a way of hiding information in correlations such that no information is accessible to any local observer. Although the set of all quantum states as a whole cannot be masked into bipartite correlations according to the no-masking theorem, the set of real states is maskable and is a maximal maskable set. In this work, we experimentally realize a masking protocol of the real ququart by virtue of a photonic quantum walk. Our experiment clearly demonstrates that quantum information of the real ququart can be completely hidden in bipartite correlations of two-qubit hybrid entangled states, which are encoded in two different degrees of freedom of a single photon. The hidden information is not accessible from each qubit alone, but can be faithfully retrieved with a fidelity of about 99% from correlation measurements. By contrast, any superset of the set of real density matrices cannot be masked.

TI Automating Equational Proofs in Dirac Notation
SO PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACM ON PROGRAMMING LANGUAGES-PACMPL
AB Dirac notation is widely used in quantum physics and quantum programming languages to define, compute and reason about quantum states. This paper considers Dirac notation from the perspective of automated reasoning. We prove two main results: first, the first-order theory of Dirac notation is decidable, by a reduction to the theory of real closed fields and Tarski's theorem. Then, we prove that validity of equations can be decided efficiently, using term-rewriting techniques. We implement our equivalence checking algorithm in Mathematica, and showcase its efficiency across more than 100 examples from the literature.

TI The standard symmetrized skew information and its applications
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICS A-MATHEMATICAL AND THEORETICAL
AB In this paper, we propose two new measures: one is symmetrized skew information and the other one is standard symmetrized skew information. Firstly, we prove their properties, such as non-negativity, convexity, invariance, additivity, monotonicity and strong monotonicity. Next, we conduct research on relationships between standard symmetrized skew information and several well-known measures in one-qubit state, aiming to compare their similarities and differences. In addition, standard symmetrized skew information is used to study quantum uncertainty. We also give the definition of standard symmetrized skew information of assistance, and provide it a straightforward operational explanation for better understanding. Finally, standard symmetrized skew information can be applied to detect entanglement.

TI Control of NV, SiV and GeV centers formation in single crystal diamond
   needles
SO DIAMOND AND RELATED MATERIALS
AB Single-crystal diamond needles in the form of micrometer-scale sharp pyramids were produced using a combination of chemical vapor deposition and thermal oxidation processes. These diamond needles with atomic-sized fluorescent defects (color centers) attract great interest for practical applications as a platform for creation of optical quantum sensing probes and optical quantum communication elements. Particular color centers localization providing suitable luminescence characteristics is required for these applications. Here we report about formation of nitrogen-vacancy (NV), silicon-vacancy (SiV) and germanium-vacancy (GeV) centers in the singlecrystal diamond needles during direct current discharge plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PE CVD). Luminescent characteristics of the needles were observed by confocal photoluminescence mapping. Analysis of experimental results allows us proposing possible mechanisms of impurities introduction into the crystal lattice during needles growth. These mechanisms include gas decomposition and etching of substrate material during CVD. The proposed mechanisms were approved by realization of CVD process protocols resulting in controllable formation of NV, SiV and GeV centers in single-crystal diamond needles including formation of thin NV- and SiVenriched layers by tuning deposition process parameters. The proposed experimental approaches in combination with revealed mechanisms for introduction of favorable impurities make single-crystal diamond needles promising candidates for scanning quantum sensing, quantum communication and hyperpolarization experiments.

TI Entanglement-free witnessing of quantum incompatibility in a

SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Quantum incompatibility, as an important quantum resource, is believed to play a key role in quantum information processing tasks. In order to detect this property, an entanglement-free incompatibility witness is proposed via constructing a combined quantum state discrimination task with prior-measurement and postmeasurement information strategies. Here we experimentally implement the witness of the incompatibility of mutually unbiased measurements under different noise levels in a qutrit system. Moreover, we estimate the robustness of incompatibility using collected data. Our work paves the path for understanding quantum incompatibility and exploring the features of the quantum resource.

TI Quantum Simulation of the Tricritical Ising Model in Tunable Josephson
   Junction Ladders
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB Modern hybrid superconductor -semiconductor Josephson junction arrays are a promising platform for analog quantum simulations. Their controllable and nonsinusoidal energy -phase relation opens the path to implement nontrivial interactions and study the emergence of exotic quantum phase transitions. Here, we propose the analysis of an array of hybrid Josephson junctions defining a two -leg ladder geometry for the quantum simulation of the tricritical Ising phase transition. This transition provides the paradigmatic example of minimal conformal models beyond Ising criticality and its excitations are intimately related to Fibonacci non -Abelian anyons and topological order in two dimensions. We study this superconducting system and its thermodynamic phases based on bosonization and matrix -product -state techniques. Its effective continuous description in terms of a three -frequency sine -Gordon quantum field theory suggests the presence of the targeted tricritical point and the numerical simulations confirm this picture. Our results indicate which experimental observables can be adopted in realistic devices to probe the physics and the phase transitions of the model. Additionally, our proposal provides a useful one-dimensional building block to design exotic topological order in two-dimensional scalable Josephson junction arrays.

TI Quantum dynamical Hamiltonian Monte Carlo
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB One of the open challenges in quantum computing is to find meaningful and practical methods to leverage quantum computation to accelerate classical machine-learning workflows. A ubiquitous problem in machinelearning workflows is sampling from probability distributions that we only have access to via their log probability. To this end, we extend the well-known Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) method for Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling to leverage quantum computation in a hybrid manner as a proposal function. Our new algorithm, Quantum Dynamical Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (QD-HMC), replaces the classical symplectic integration proposal step with simulations of quantum-coherent continuous-space dynamics on digital or analog quantum computers. We show that QD-HMC maintains key characteristics of HMC, such as maintaining the detailed balanced condition with momentum inversion, while also having the potential for polynomial speedups over its classical counterpart in certain scenarios. As sampling is a core subroutine in many forms of probabilistic inference, and MCMC in continuously parametrized spaces covers a large class of potential applications, this work widens the areas of applicability of quantum devices.

TI Atmospheric Turbulence-Controlled Cryptosystems
SO IEEE PHOTONICS JOURNAL
AB To overcome the limitations of QKD, post-quantum cryptography, and computational security-based cryptography protocols in this paper, an atmospheric turbulencecontrolled cryptosystem is proposed. The proposed encryption scheme employs the traditional scheme to utilize the atmospheric turbulence as the common source of randomness only in the initialization stage to determine the common parameters to be used in the proposed encryption scheme. To overcome low secret-key rates of traditional scheme, dictated by the long coherence time T c of turbulence channel, the proposed encryption scheme updates the parameters of gamma-gamma distribution, used to generate irradiance samples for cumulative distribution function-based determination of the key, every T c seconds and as such the final key is shaped by the atmospheric turbulence channel. We also describe a scheme that randomly selects one of several available paths in which the simultaneously measured irradiance samples, after interleaving, are used to generate the raw key. The secret-key rates of the proposed schemes are orders of magnitude higher compared to corresponding traditional QKD and source type physical-layer security schemes and are comparable with the state-of-the-art optical communication data rates.

TI New Quantum Private Comparison Using Bell States
SO ENTROPY
AB Quantum private comparison (QPC) represents a cryptographic approach that enables two parties to determine whether their confidential data are equivalent, without disclosing the actual values. Most existing QPC protocols utilizing single photons or Bell states are considered highly feasible, but they suffer from inefficiency. To address this issue, we present a novel QPC protocol that capitalizes on the entanglement property of Bell states and local operations to meet the requirements of efficiency. In the proposed protocol, two participants with private inputs perform local operations on shared Bell states received from a semi-honest third party (STP). Afterward, the modified qubits are returned to the STP, who can then determine the equality of the private inputs and relay the results to the participants. A simulation on the IBM Quantum Cloud Platform confirmed the feasibility of our protocol, and a security analysis further demonstrated that the STP and both participants were unable to learn anything about the individual private inputs. In comparison to other QPC protocols, our proposed solution offers superior performance in terms of efficiency.

TI Universal logic with encoded spin qubits in silicon
SO NATURE
AB Quantum computation features known examples of hardware acceleration for certain problems, but is challenging to realize because of its susceptibility to small errors from noise or imperfect control. The principles of fault tolerance may enable computational acceleration with imperfect hardware, but they place strict requirements on the character and correlation of errors(1). For many qubit technologies(2-21), some challenges to achieving fault tolerance can be traced to correlated errors arising from the need to control qubits by injecting microwave energy matching qubit resonances. Here we demonstrate an alternative approach to quantum computation that uses energy-degenerate encoded qubit states controlled by nearest-neighbour contact interactions that partially swap the spin states of electrons with those of their neighbours. Calibrated sequences of such partial swaps, implemented using only voltage pulses, allow universal quantum control while bypassing microwave-associated correlated error sources(1,22-28). We use an array of six Si-28/SiGe quantum dots, built using a platform that is capable of extending in two dimensions following processes used in conventional microelectronics(29). We quantify the operational fidelity of universal control of two encoded qubits using interleaved randomized benchmarking(30), finding a fidelity of 96.3% +/- 0.7% for encoded controlled NOT operations and 99.3% +/- .5% for encoded SWAP. The quantum coherence offered by enriched silicon(5-9,16,18,20,22,27,29,31-37), the all-electrical and low-crosstalk-control of partial swap operations(1,22-28) and the configurable insensitivity of our encoding to certain error sources(28,33,34,38) all combine to offer a strong pathway towards scalable fault tolerance and computational advantage.

TI Monomer-dimer tensor-network basis for qubit-regularized lattice gauge
   theories
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW D
AB Traditional SU(N) lattice gauge theories (LGTs) can be formulated using an orthonormal basis constructed from the irreducible representations (irreps) VA of the SU(N) gauge symmetry. On a lattice, the elements of this basis are tensor networks comprising dimer tensors on the links labeled by a set of irreps {Al} and monomer tensors on sites labeled by {As}. These tensors naturally define a local site Hilbert space, Hgs, on which gauge transformations act. Gauss's law introduces an additional index as = 1, 2, ..., D(Hgs) that labels an orthonormal basis of the gauge-invariant subspace of Hgs. This monomer-dimer tensor-network (MDTN) basis, {As}, {Al}, {as}), of the physical Hilbert space enables the construction of new qubit-regularized SU(N) gauge theories that are free of sign problems while preserving key features of traditional LGTs. Here, we investigate finite-temperature confinement-deconfinement transitions in a simple qubit-regularized SU(2) and SU(3) gauge theory in d = 2 and d = 3 spatial dimensions, formulated using the MDTN basis, and show that they reproduce the universal results of traditional LGTs at these transitions. Additionally, in d = 1, we demonstrate using a plaquette chain that the string tension at zero temperature can be continuously tuned to zero by adjusting a model parameter that plays the role of the gauge coupling in traditional LGTs.

TI An educational model of the Deutsch algorithm for secondary school
SO EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB In this paper, we present the outline of an educational path to introduce a crucial historical turnpoint of quantum information research-namely the Deutsch algorithm-to secondary school students. We discuss a basic elementarization strategy allowing students to single out and focus on the individual features of quantum mechanics involved in the different steps of the algorithm information processing phase, which can potentially be useful for the educational reconstruction of other algorithms and protocols. The sequence includes the experimental realization on the optical bench of an analogue of the Deutsch algorithm, working with classical coherent light. The educational path was tested both in curricular and out-of-school settings, and preliminary results will be discussed.

TI Verified Compilation of Quantum Oracles
SO PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACM ON PROGRAMMING LANGUAGES-PACMPL
AB Quantum algorithms often apply classical operations, such as arithmetic or predicate checks, over a quantum superposition of classical data; these so-called oracles are often the largest components of a quantum program. To ease the construction of efficient, correct oracle functions, this paper presents VQO, a high-assurance framework implemented with the Coq proof assistant. The core of VQO is OQASM, the oracle quantum assembly language. OQASM operations move qubits between two different bases via the quantum Fourier transform, thus admitting important optimizations, but without inducing entanglement and the exponential blowup that comes with it. OQASM's design enabled us to prove correct VQO's compilers-from a simple imperative language called OQIMP to OQASM, and from OQASM to sqir, a general-purpose quantum assembly language-and allowed us to efficiently test properties of OQASM programs using the QuickChick property-based testing framework. We have used VQO to implement a variety of arithmetic and geometric operators that are building blocks for important oracles, including those used in Shor's and Grover's algorithms. We found that VQO's QFT-based arithmetic oracles require fewer qubits, sometimes substantially fewer, than those constructed using "classical" gates; VQO's versions of the latter were nevertheless on par with or better than (in terms of both qubit and gate counts) oracles produced by Quipper, a state-of-the-art but unverified quantum programming platform.

TI A quantum information processing machine for computing by observables
SO PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF
   AMERICA
AB A quantum machine that accepts an input and processes it in parallel is described. The logic variables of the machine are not wavefunctions (qubits) but observables (i.e., operators) and its operation is described in the Heisenberg picture. The active core is a solid-state assembly of small nanosized colloidal quantum dots (QDs) or dimers of dots. The size dispersion of the QDs that causes fluctuations in their discrete electronic energies is a limiting factor. The input to the machine is provided by a train of very brief laser pulses, at least four in number. The coherent band width of each ultrashort pulse needs to span at least several and preferably all the single electron excited states of the dots. The spectrum of the QD assembly is measured as a function of the time delays between the input laser pulses. The dependence of the spectrum on the time delays can be Fourier transformed to a frequency spectrum. This spectrum of a finite range in time is made up of discrete pixels. These are the visible, raw, basic logic variables. The spectrum is analyzed to determine a possibly smaller number of principal components. A Lie-algebraic point of view is used to explore the use of the machine to emulate the dynamics of other quantum systems. An explicit example demonstrates the considerable quantum advantage of our scheme.

TI Interspecies Förster resonances for Rb-Cs Rydberg d-states for enhanced
   multi-qubit gate fidelities
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB We present an analysis of interspecies interactions between Rydberg d-states of rubidium and cesium. We identify the Forster resonance channels offering the strongest interspecies couplings, demonstrating the viability for performing high-fidelity two- and multi-qubit CkZ gates up to k = 4, including accounting for blockade errors evaluated via numerical diagonalization of the pair potentials. Our results show d-state orbitals offer enhanced suppression of intraspecies couplings compared to s-states, making them well suited for use in large-scale neutral atom quantum processors.

AB Quantum readout noise turns out to be the most significant source of error, which greatly affects the measurement fidelity. Matrix-based calibration has been demonstrated to be effective in various quantum platforms. However, existing methodologies are fundamentally limited in either scalability or accuracy. Inspired by the classical finite element method (FEM), a formal method to model the complex interaction between elements, we present our calibration framework named QuFEM. First, we apply a divide-and-conquer strategy that formulates the calibration as a series of tensor products with noise matrices. This matrices are iteratively characterized together with the calibrated probability distribution, aiming to capture the inherent locality of qubit interactions. Then, to accelerate the end-to-end calibration, we propose a sparse tensor-product engine to exploit the sparsity in the intermediate values. Our experiments show that QuFEM achieves 2.5x103x speedup in the 136-qubit calibration compared to the state-of-the-art matrix-based calibration technique [50], and provides 1.2x and 1.4x fidelity improvement on the 18-qubit and 36-qubit real-world quantum devices.

TI Quantum algorithms for computing general discrete logarithms and orders
   with tradeoffs
SO JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICAL CRYPTOLOGY
AB We generalize our earlier works on computing short discrete logarithms with tradeoffs, and bridge them with Seifert's work on computing orders with tradeoffs, and with Shor's groundbreaking works on computing orders and general discrete logarithms. In particular, we enable tradeoffs when computing general discrete logarithms. Compared to Shor's algorithm, this yields a reduction by up to a factor of two in the number of group operations evaluated quantumly in each run, at the expense of having to perform multiple runs. Unlike Shor's algorithm, our algorithm does not require the group order to be known. It simultaneously computes both the order and the logarithm. We analyze the probability distributions induced by our algorithm, and by Shor's and Seifert's order-finding algorithms, describe how these algorithms may be simulated when the solution is known, and estimate the number of runs required for a given minimum success probability when making different tradeoffs.

TI Quantum Secure Multi-Party Summation Using Single Photons
SO ENTROPY
AB In this paper, we propose a secure multi-party summation based on single photons. With the help of a semi-honest third party, n participants can simultaneously obtain the summation result without revealing their secret inputs. Our protocol uses single photon states as the information carriers. In addition, each participant with secret input only performs simple single-particle operators rather than particle preparation and any complex quantum measurements. These features make our protocol more feasible to implement. We demonstrate the correctness and security of the proposed protocol, which is resistant to participant attack and outside attack. In the end, we compare in detail the performance of the quantum summation protocol in this paper with other schemes in terms of different indicators. By comparison, our protocol is efficient and easy to implement.

TI Modeling of spin decoherence in a Si hole qubit perturbed by a single
   charge fluctuator
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
AB Spin qubits in semiconductor quantum dots are one of the promising devices to realize a quantum processor. A better knowledge of the noise sources affecting the coherence of such a qubit is therefore of prime importance. In this paper, we study the effect of telegraphic noise induced by the fluctuation of a single electric charge. We simulate as realistically as possible a hole spin qubit in a quantum dot defined electrostatically by a set of gates along a silicon nanowire channel. Calculations combining Poisson and time-dependent Schrodinger equations allow us to simulate the relaxation and the dephasing of the hole spin as a function of time for a classical random telegraph signal. We show that dephasing time T2 is well given by a two-level model in a wide range of frequencies. Remarkably, in the most realistic configuration of a low-frequency fluctuator, the system has a non-Gaussian behavior in which the phase coherence is lost as soon as the fluctuator has changed state. The Gaussian description becomes valid only beyond a threshold frequency omega th, when the two-level system reacts to the statistical distribution of the fluctuator states. We show that the dephasing time T2(omega th) at this threshold frequency can be considerably increased by playing on the orientation of the magnetic field and the gate potentials, by running the qubit along "sweet" lines. However, T2(omega th) remains bounded due to dephasing induced by the nondiagonal terms of the stochastic perturbation Hamiltonian. On the other hand, our simulations reveal that the spin relaxation, usually characterized by the time T1, cannot be described cleanly in the two -level model because the coupling to higher-energy hole levels impacts very strongly the spin decoherence. This result suggests that multilevel simulations including the coupling to phonons should be necessary to describe the relaxation phenomenon in this type of qubit.

TI Recovery of damaged information via scrambling in indefinite causal
   order
SO PHYSICA SCRIPTA
AB Scrambling prevents the access to local information with local operators and therefore can be used to protect quantum information from damage caused by local perturbations. Even though partial quantum information can be recovered if the type of the damage is known, the initial target state cannot be completely recovered, because the obtained state is a mixture of the initial state and a maximally mixed state. Here, we demonstrate an improved scheme to recover damaged quantum information via scrambling in indefinite causal order. We show that scheme with indefinite causal order can record information of the damage and distill the initial state from the damaged state simultaneously. It allows us to retrieve initial information versus any damage. Moreover, by iterating the schemes, the initial quantum state can be completely recovered. In addition, we experimentally demonstrate our schemes on the cloud-based quantum computer, named as Quafu. Our work proposes a feasible scheme to protect whole quantum information from damage, which is also compatible with other techniques such as quantum error corrections and entanglement purification protocols. We expect that our scheme will be useful in the both quantum information recovery from the damage and systems bench-marking.

TI Direct interferometric test of the nonlinear phase-shift gate
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Probabilistic quantum gates permeate nearly all aspects of modern linear optical quantum computing. This is largely due to the measurement induced nonlinearities of which they are capable. The tradeoff between the cost of resources required to boost success probabilities to scalable levels and the realization of effective photon-photon interactions required grows ever more favorable to this paradigm with rapidly evolving advancements in integrated nanophotonics. As quantum circuits generating cluster states become increasingly complex, component analysis is critical. In this paper, we propose and demonstrate the experimental viability of testing a probabilistic gate. Specifically, as an illustrative example of the technique, we propose a direct test of the nonlinear phase-shift gate (NLPSG), an essential component of a Knill-Laflamme-Milburn (KLM) controlled-NOT (cNoT) gate. We develop our analysis for both the case of the original bulk optical KLM NLPSG and the case of the scalable integrated nanophotonic NLPSG based on microring resonators (MRRs) that we have proposed very recently. We consider the interference between the target photon mode of the NLPSG along one arm of a Mach-Zehnder interferometer (MZI) and a mode subject to an adjustable linear phase along the other arm. Analysis of triple-photon coincidences between the two modes at the output of the MZI and the success ancillary mode of the NLPSG provides a signature of the conditionally successful operation of the NLPSG. We examine the triple coincidence results for experimentally realistic cases of click or no-click detection with subunity detection efficiencies. Further, we compare the case for which the MZI input modes are seeded with weak coherent states with that for which the input states are those resulting from colinear spontaneous parametric down conversion (cl-SPDC). In particular, we show that, though more difficult to prepare, cl-SPDC states offer clear advantages for performing the test, especially in the case of relatively low photon detector efficiency. We develop the interferometric analysis in terms of a general four-mode unitary so that comparison and contrast of the signatures of the specific NLPSG implementation (i.e., KLM and MRR) can be carried out easily by substituting in the appropriate unitary matrix elements at the end of the calculation. The analysis is readily extendable to other several-mode low photon number quantum circuits the successful operation of which is heralded by the measurement of ancilla photons, under nonideal detection conditions germane to laboratory experiments.

AB The NIST Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC) standardization challenge was launched in December 2016 and recently, has released its first results. The whole process has given a considerable dynamic to the research in post-quantum cryptography, in particular to practical aspects, such as the study of the vulnerabilities of post-quantum algorithms to side-channel attacks. In this paper, we present a realistic template attack against the reference implementation of Classic McEliece which is a finalist of the 4th round of NIST PQC standardization. This profiled attack allowed us to accurately find the Hamming weight of each coefficient of the Goppa polynomial. With only one decryption, this result enables us first, to find directly the Goppa polynomial in the case of weak keys with the method of Loidreau and Sendrier (P. Loidreau and N. Sendrier, "Weak keys in the McEliece public-key cryptosystem", IEEE Trans. Inf. Theory, 2001). Then, in the case of "slightly less weak keys", we also find this polynomial with an exhaustive search with low complexity. Finally, we propose the best complexity reduction for exhaustive Goppa polynomial search on F2m. We attack the constanttime implementation of Classic McEliece proposed by Chen et al. This implementation, which follows the NIST specification, is realized on a stm32f4-Discovery microcontroller with a 32-bit ARM Cortex-M4.

TI Quantum simulation of an exotic quantum critical point in a two-site
   charge Kondo circuit
SO NATURE PHYSICS
AB Tuning a material to the cusp between two distinct ground states can produce physical properties that are unlike those in either of the neighbouring phases. Advances in the fabrication and control of quantum systems have raised the tantalizing prospect of artificial quantum simulators that can capture such behaviour. A tunable array of coupled qubits should have an appropriately rich phase diagram, but realizing such a system with either tunnel-coupled semiconductor quantum dots or metal nanostructures has proven difficult. The challenge for scaling up to clusters or lattices is to ensure that each element behaves essentially identically and that the coupling between elements is uniform, while also maintaining tunability of the interactions. Here we study a nanoelectronic circuit comprising two coupled hybrid metal-semiconductor islands, combining the strengths of both materials to form a potentially scalable platform. The semiconductor component allows for controllable inter-site couplings at quantum point contacts, while the metal component's effective continuum of states means that different sites can be made equivalent by tuning local potentials. The couplings afforded by this architecture can realize an unusual quantum critical point resulting from frustrated Kondo interactions. The observed critical behaviour matches theoretical predictions, verifying the success of our experimental quantum simulation.
   The quantum critical behaviour of a two-impurity Kondo model variant is observed in a system of hybrid-semiconductor islands that could provide a scalable platform for solid-state quantum simulation

TI Microwave-to-optics conversion characteristics based on four-wave mixing
   of Rydberg atoms at room temperature
SO ACTA PHYSICA SINICA
AB Microwave-to-optics conversion is a core technology for hybrid quantum networks, enabling the integration of microwave and optical frequency domains essential for quantum communication and quantum information processing. However, the Doppler broadening effect in thermal atomic ensembles often severely limits the conversion efficiency. This study aims to propose a novel mechanism for microwave-to-optics conversion using four-wave mixing (FWM) in room-temperature Rydberg atoms, addressing the challenges posed by Doppler broadening and providing a theoretical framework for practical applications. We develop a theoretical model based on the coupled Maxwell-Bloch equations to describe the FWM process in a symmetric double-ladder four-level system. The density matrix method and perturbation method combined with Maxwell's equations are used to derive an analytical expression for the coherence coefficient between the microwave field and the optical field. This coherence coefficient characterizes the energy transfer between the microwave and optical fields and is used to obtain an analytical expression for the FWM conversion efficiency. We use cesium vapor as a medium to analyze the propagation characteristics of the FWM efficiency and explore the effects of laser field intensity and the Doppler effect on the conversion efficiency. Our analysis reveals that the detuning effect caused by the thermal motion of atoms significantly reduces the resonance coupling efficiency. Specifically, when the Doppler frequency is lower than the natural linewidth, the conversion efficiency can be notably improved. In a Doppler-free environment, the conversion efficiency approaches unity at an optimal propagation distance. In contrast, in room-temperature cesium vapor (300 K), the conversion efficiency is significantly reduced due to Doppler broadening. However, by cooling the atoms to microkelvin temperatures, the Doppler broadening can be minimized, leading to a substantial increase in conversion efficiency. This study provides new theoretical guidance and experimental schemes for microwave-to-optics conversion at room temperature. The proposed mechanism based on Rydberg atoms provides a promising approach to overcoming the limitations imposed by Doppler broadening. Our findings are of great significance for advancing quantum information technology, especially in the context of developing efficient quantum networks.

Our analysis reveals that the detuning effect caused by the thermal motion of atoms significantly reduces the resonance coupling efficiency. Specifically, when the Doppler frequency is lower than the natural linewidth, the conversion efficiency can be notably improved. In a Doppler-free environment, the conversion efficiency approaches unity at an optimal propagation distance. In contrast, in room-temperature cesium vapor (300 K), the conversion efficiency is significantly reduced due to Doppler broadening. However, by cooling the atoms to microkelvin temperatures, the Doppler broadening can be minimized, leading to a substantial increase in conversion efficiency. This study provides new theoretical guidance and experimental schemes for microwave-to-optics conversion at room temperature. The proposed mechanism based on Rydberg atoms provides a promising approach to overcoming the limitations imposed by Doppler broadening. Our findings are of great significance for advancing quantum information technology, especially in the context of developing efficient quantum networks.

TI Reducing Leakage of Single-Qubit Gates for Superconducting Quantum
   Processors Using Analytical Control Pulse Envelopes
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB Improving the speed and fidelity of quantum logic gates is essential to reach quantum advantage with future quantum computers. However, fast logic gates lead to increased leakage errors in superconducting quantum processors based on qubits with low anharmonicity, such as transmons. To reduce leakage errors, we propose and experimentally demonstrate two new analytical methods, Fourier ansatz spectrum tuning derivative removal by adiabatic gate (FAST DRAG) and higher-derivative (HD) DRAG, both of which enable shaping single-qubit control pulses in the frequency domain to achieve stronger suppression of leakage transitions compared to previously demonstrated pulse shapes. Using the new methods to suppress the ef transition of a transmon qubit with an anharmonicity of -212 MHz, we implement R-X(pi/2) gates achieving a leakage error below 3.0x10(-5) down to a gate duration of 6.25 ns without the need for iterative closed-loop optimization. The obtained leakage error represents a 20-fold reduction in leakage compared to a conventional cosine DRAG pulse. Employing the FAST DRAG method, we further achieve an error per gate of (1.56 +/- 0.07)x10(-4) at a 7.9-ns gate duration, outperforming conventional pulse shapes both in terms of error and gate speed. Furthermore, we study error-amplifying measurements for the characterization of temporal microwave control-pulse distortions, and demonstrate that non-Markovian coherent errors caused by such distortions may be a significant source of error for sub-10-ns single-qubit gates unless corrected using predistortion.

TI Toward Quantum Interconnects Featuring Nanometer-to-Picometer Bandwidth
   Compression and THz-Range Quantum Frequency Conversion
SO IEEE PHOTONICS JOURNAL
AB The long-range transmission of quantum information relies on multiple interfaces between photons, acting as flying qubits, and localized memories, serving as repeaters, to mitigate transmission losses. Efficient, long-range transmission necessitates the use of short, picosecond-scale photons, which are markedly different from the narrowband, nanosecond-scale photons optimal for absorption by memory elements, typically operating at wavelengths far from telecom. In this article, we point toward designs capable of bridging these regimes, leveraging the interplay between sum-frequency generation-based quantum frequency conversion and resonant confinement in an integrated ring resonator.

AB In recent years, scholars have developed Identity-Based Matching Encryption (IB-ME), which enables both the sender and the receiver to specify identities, ensuring ciphertext confidentiality only when these identities match. Building on this concept, our work introduces Revocable Identity-Based Matching Encryption (RIB-ME), which incorporates a revocable mechanism to withdraw decryption rights from unauthorized users. Current RIB-ME schemes rely on a variant of the Diffie-Hellman assumption, rendering it susceptible to quantum computing attacks. To address this vulnerability, we propose a generic construction of RIB-ME inspired by Wang et al. Our approach employs two-level Revocable Hierarchical Identity-Based Encryption (RHIBE) and Identity-Based Signature (IBS) and is compatible with post-quantum encryption schemes. This enables the development of a generic construction of RIB-ME and the creation of the first post-quantum RIB-ME through the use of post-quantum constructions.

TI A Hybrid Quantum-Classical Network for Eye-Written Digit Recognition
SO ELECTRONICS
AB Eye-written digit recognition presents a promising alternative communication method for individuals affected by amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. However, the development of robust models in this field is limited by the availability of datasets, due to the complex and unstable procedure of collecting eye-written samples. Previous work has proposed both conventional techniques and deep neural networks to classify eye-written digits, achieving moderate to high accuracy with variability across runs. In this study, we explore the potential of quantum machine learning by presenting a hybrid quantum-classical model that integrates a variational quantum circuit into a classical deep neural network architecture. While classical models already achieve strong performance, this work examines the potential of quantum-enhanced models to achieve such performance with fewer parameters and greater expressive capacity. To further improve robustness and stability, we employ an ensemble strategy that aggregates predictions from multiple trained instances of the hybrid model. This study serves as a proof-of-concept to evaluate the feasibility of incorporating a compact 4-qubit quantum circuit within a lightweight hybrid model. The proposed model achieves 98.52% accuracy with a standard deviation of 1.99, supporting the potential of combining quantum and classical computing for assistive communication technologies and encouraging further research in quantum biosignal interpretation and human-computer interaction.

AB The learning with errors problem (LWE) is one of the most important building blocks for post-quantum cryptography. To better understand the quantum hardness of LWE, it is crucial to explore quantum variants of LWE. To this end, Chen, Liu, and Zhandry [Eurocrypt 2022] defined S vertical bar LWE > and C vertical bar LWE > problems by encoding the error of LWE samples into quantum amplitudes, and showed efficient quantum algorithms for a few interesting amplitudes. However, algorithms or hardness results of the most interesting amplitude, Gaussian, were not addressed before.
   In this paper, we show new algorithms, hardness results and applications for S vertical bar LWE > and C vertical bar LWE > with real Gaussian, Gaussian with linear or quadratic phase terms, and other related amplitudes. Let n be the dimension, q be the modulus of LWE samples. Our main results are
   1. There is a 2(Theta(root n log q))-time algorithm for S vertical bar LWE > with Gaussian amplitude with known phase, given 2(Theta(root n log q)) many quantum samples. The algorithm is modified from Kuperberg's sieve, and in fact works for more general amplitudes as long as the amplitudes and phases are completely known.
   2. There is a polynomial time quantum algorithm for solving S vertical bar LWE > and C vertical bar LWE > for Gaussian with quadratic phase amplitudes, where the sample complexity is as small as (O) over tilde (n). As an application, we give a quantum oblivious LWE sampler where the core quantum sampler requires only quasi-linear sample complexity. This improves upon the previous oblivious LWE sampler given by Debris-Alazard, Fallahpour, Stehle [STOC 2024], whose core quantum sampler requires. (O) over tilde (nr) sample complexity, where r is the standard deviation of the error.
   3. There exist polynomial time quantum reductions from standard LWE or worst-case GapSVP to S vertical bar LWE > with Gaussian amplitude with small unknown phase, and arbitrarily many samples. Compared to the first two items, the appearance of the unknown phase term places a barrier in designing efficient quantum algorithm for solving standard LWE via S vertical bar LWE >.

TI Generalized measurements on qubits in quantum randomness certification
   and expansion
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW APPLIED
AB Quantum mechanics has greatly impacted our understanding of microscopic nature. One of the key concepts of this theory is generalized measurements, which have proven useful in various quantum information processing tasks. However, despite their significance, they have not yet been shown empirically to provide an advantage in quantum randomness certification and expansion protocols. This investigation explores scenarios where generalized measurements can yield more than 1 bit of certified randomness with a single-qubit system measurement on untrusted devices and against a quantum adversary. We compare the robustness of several protocols to exhibit the advantage of exploiting generalized measurements. In our analysis of experimental data, we were able to obtain 1.21 bits of min-entropy from a measurement taken on one qubit of an entangled state. We also obtained 1.07 bits of min-entropy from an experiment with quantum state preparation and generalized measurement on a single qubit. We also provide finite data analysis for a protocol using generalized measurements and the Entropy Accumulation Theorem. Our exploration demonstrates the potential of generalized measurements to improve the certification of quantum sources of randomness and enhance the security of quantum cryptographic protocols and other areas of quantum information.

This is an extremely hard task for current computational technology, but might be reachable in the coming quantum computing era. In this paper, we discuss the computational complexities of classical and quantum simulations of lattice QCD. It is shown that the quantum simulation scales better as a function of nucleon number and thus will outperform classical simulation for large nuclei.

TI Asymptotic phase-locking and synchronization in two-qubit systems
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICS COMMUNICATIONS
AB The paper concerns spontaneous asymptotic phase-locking and synchronization in two-qubit systems undergoing continuous Markovian evolution described by Lindbladian dynamics with normal Lindblad operators. Using analytic methods, all phase-locking-enforcing mechanisms within the given framework are obtained and classified. Detailed structures of their respective attractor spaces are provided and used to explore their properties from various perspectives. Amid phase-locking processes those additionally enforcing identical stationary parts of both qubits are identified, including as a special case the strictest form of synchronization conceivable. A prominent basis is presented which reveals that from a physical point of view two main types of phase-locking mechanisms exist. The ability to preserve information about the initial state is explored and an upper bound on the amplitude of oscillations of the resulting phase-locked dynamics is established. Permutation symmetry of both asymptotic states and phase-locking mechanisms is discussed. Lastly, the possibility of entanglement production playing the role of a phase-locking witness is rebutted by three analytically treatable examples.

SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB In a solid-state spin system, we experimentally demonstrate a protocol for quantum-state population transfer with an improved efficiency compared to traditional stimulated Raman adiabatic passage (STIRAP). Using the ground-state triplet of the nitrogen-vacancy center in diamond, we show that the required evolution time for high-fidelity state transfer can be reduced by almost one order of magnitude. Furthermore, we establish an improved robustness against frequency detuning caused by magnetic noise as compared to STIRAP. These results provide a powerful tool for coherent spin manipulation in the context of quantum sensing and quantum computation.

TI Quantum simulation of lattice QCD with improved Hamiltonians
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW D
AB Quantum simulations of lattice gauge theories are anticipated to directly probe the real time dynamics of QCD, but scale unfavorably with the required truncation of the gauge fields. Improved Hamiltonians are derived to correct for the effects of gauge field truncations on the SU(3) Kogut-Susskind Hamiltonian. It is shown in 1 + 1D that this enables low chromoelectric field truncations to quantitatively reproduce features of the untruncated theory over a range of couplings and quark masses. In 3 + 1D, an improved Hamiltonian is derived for lattice QCD with staggered massless fermions. It is shown in the strong coupling limit that the spectrum qualitatively reproduces aspects of two flavor QCD and simulations of a small system are performed on IBM's Perth quantum processor.

Modus ponens is a fundamental form of inference that involves affirming the antecedent to affirm the consequent. Inspired by the quantum computer, the superposition of true and false is used for the parallel processing. In this work, we propose a quantum version of modus ponens. Additionally, we introduce two generations of quantum modus ponens: quantum modus ponens inference chain and multidimensional quantum modus ponens. Finally, a simple implementation of quantum modus ponens on the OriginQ quantum computing cloud platform is demonstrated.

TI Magnetoelectric Cavity Magnonics in Skyrmion Crystals
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB We present a theory of magnetoelectric magnon-photon coupling in cavities hosting noncentrosymmet-ric magnets. Analogously to nonreciprocal phenomena in multiferroics, the magnetoelectric coupling is time-reversal and inversion asymmetric. This asymmetry establishes a means for exceptional tunability of magnon-photon coupling, which can be switched on and off by reversing the magnetization direc-tion. Taking the multiferroic skyrmion host Cu2OSeO3 with ultralow magnetic damping as an example, we reveal the electrical activity of skyrmion eigenmodes and propose it for magnon-photon splitting of "magnetically dark" elliptic modes. Furthermore, we predict a cavity-induced magnon-magnon coupling between magnetoelectrically active skyrmion excitations. We discuss applications in quantum informa-tion processing by proposing protocols for all-electrical magnon-mediated photon quantum gates, and a photon-mediated SPLIT operation of magnons. Our study highlights magnetoelectric cavity magnonics as a novel platform for realizing quantum-hybrid systems and the coherent transduction between photons and magnons in topological magnetic textures.

TI Complexity of Eccentricities and All-Pairs Shortest Paths in the Quantum
   CONGEST Model
SO SPIN
AB Computing the distance parameters of a network, including the diameter, radius, eccentricities and the all-pairs shortest paths (APSP) is a central problem in distributed computing. This paper investigates the distance parameters in the quantum CONGEST models and establishes almost linear lower bounds on eccentricities and APSP, which match the classical upper bounds. Our results imply that there is not quantum speedup for these two problems. In contrast with the diameter and radius, exchanging quantum messages is able to save the communication when the networks have low diameters [F. L. Gall and F. Magniez, Sublinear-time quantum computation of the diameter in CONGEST networks, in Proc. 2018 ACM Symp. Principles of Distributed Computing (PODC), (2018), pp. 337-346; F. Magniez and A. Nayak, arXiv:2002.11795]. We obtain the lower bounds via a reduction from the two-way quantum communication complexity of the set intersection [A. A. Razborov, Izv. Math. 159 (2003)].

TI Taming plasmonic nanocavities for persistent entanglement
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
AB Recent rapid advances in quantum nanoplasmonics offer the potential for accessing quantum phenomena at room temperature. Despite this, entangled states have not yet been realized, and remain an outstanding challenge. In this work, we demonstrate how entanglement emerges in plasmonic nanocavities, which are inherently multimode, and demonstrate the conditions necessary for entanglement to persist. We find that, in general, these conditions are broken due to coupling with multiple plasmonic modes of different parity. We address this challenge with a new nanocavity design that supports high selective coupling to a single mode, enabling the robust generation of persistent entanglement in nanoplasmonics. Our results open exciting prospects for leveraging simple plasmonic setups in ambient conditions for applications in quantum communication, sensing, and rapid quantum memories.

TI Stronger EPR-steering criterion based on inferred Schrödinger-Robertson
   uncertainty relation
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB Steering is one of the three in-equivalent forms of nonlocal correlations intermediate between Bell nonlocality and entanglement. Schrodinger-Robertson uncertainty relation (SRUR), has been widely used to detect entanglement and steering. However, the steering criterion in earlier works, based on SRUR, did not involve complete inferred-variance uncertainty relation. In this paper, by considering the local hidden state model and Reid's formalism, we derive a complete inferred-variance EPR-steering criterion based on SRUR in the bipartite scenario. Furthermore, we check the effectiveness of our steering criterion with discrete variable bipartite two-qubit and two-qutrit isotropic states.

TI Direct generation of spatially entangled qudits using quantum nonlinear
   optical holography
SO SCIENCE ADVANCES
AB Nonlinear holography shapes the amplitude and phase of generated new harmonics using nonlinear processes. Classical nonlinear holography influenced many fields in optics, from information storage, demultiplexing of spatial information, and all-optical control of accelerating beams. Here, we extend the concept of nonlinear ho-lography to the quantum regime. We directly shape the spatial quantum correlations of entangled photon pairs in two-dimensional patterned nonlinear photonic crystals using spontaneous parametric down conversion, without any pump shaping. The generated signal-idler pair obeys a parity conservation law that is governed by the nonlinear crystal. Furthermore, the quantum states exhibit quantum correlations and violate the Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt inequality, thus enabling entanglement-based quantum key distribution. Our demonstration paves the way for controllable on-chip quantum optics schemes using the high-dimensional spatial degree of freedom.

TI Integration of a high-fidelity model of quantum sensors with a
   map-matching filter for quantum-enhanced navigation
SO QUANTUM SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB Harnessing the potential of quantum sensors to assist in navigation requires enabling their operation in complex, dynamic environments and integrating them within existing navigation systems. While cross-couplings from platform dynamics generally degrade quantum measurements in a complex manner, navigation filters would need to be designed to handle such complex quantum sensor data. In this work, we report on the realization of a high-fidelity model of an atom-interferometry-based gravity gradiometer and demonstrate its integration with a map-matching navigation filter. Relying on the ability of our model to simulate the sensor behaviour across various dynamic platform environments, we show that aiding navigation via map matching using quantum gravity gradiometry results in stable trajectories, and highlight the importance of non-Gaussian errors arising from platform dynamics as a key challenge to map-matching navigation. We derive requirements for mitigating these errors, such as maintaining sensor tilt below 3.3(degrees), to inform future sensor development priorities. This work demonstrates the value of an end-to-end approach that could support future optimization of the overall navigation system. Beyond navigation, our atom interferometer modelling framework could be relevant to current research and innovation endeavours with quantum gravimeters, gradiometers and inertial sensors.

TI A laser source driver in 0.18 μm SiGe BiCMOS technology for high
   speed quantum key distribution
SO AIP ADVANCES
AB Quantum key distribution (QKD) has rapidly developed recently. The repetition frequency of the QKD system increases from tens or hundreds of MHz to GHz. A laser diode (LD) operating in gain-switched mode is widely used as a weak coherent light source in a QKD system. We present an LD driver circuit fabricated in 0.18 mu m SiGe heterojunction bipolar transistor bipolar complementary metal oxide semiconductor technology. The circuit can operate at frequencies up to 2.5 GHz, satisfying the requirements of high-speed laser drives in practical QKD systems. The output current of the driver circuit can reach 100 mA when driving an LD whose input equivalent resistance is & SIM;21 omega. The extinction ratio of the 1550-nm distributed feedback LD light source driven by our driver circuit reaches 23 dB at the operating frequency of 2.5 GHz, meeting the requirements of QKD systems. This circuit will be used in miniaturized QKD systems. (C) 2022 Author(s).

TI Experimental simulation of the parity-time symmetric dynamics using
   photonic qubits
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB The concept of parity-time (PT) symmetry originates from the framework of quantum mechanics, where if the Hamiltonian operator satisfies the commutation relation with the parity and time operators, it shows real energy spectrum. Recently, PT symmetry was introduced into various systems, such as optics, electronic circuits, acoustics, and other classical fields to further study the dynamical behaviors of the Hamiltonian and the energies. To focus on the dynamical evolution of the quantum state, here we experimentally studied the dynamical evolution of a two-level quantum system under the PT symmetric Hamiltonian using single-photon system. By enlarging the system using ancillary qubit and encoding the subsystem under the non-Hermitian Hamiltonian with post-selection, the evolution of the state can be characterized with a high fidelity. Owing to the effectively operation of the dilation method, our work provides a route for further exploiting the exotic properties of PT symmetric Hamiltonian for quantum simulation and quantum information processing.

TI Suppression of coherent errors during entangling operations in NV
   centers in diamond
SO APPLIED PHYSICS LETTERS
AB We consider entangling operations in a single nitrogen-vacancy center in diamond where the hyperfine-coupled nuclear spin qubits are addressed with radio frequency pulses conditioned on the state of the central electron spin. Limiting factors for the gate fidelity are coherent errors due to off-resonant driving of neighboring transitions in the dense, hyperfine-split energy spectrum of the defect and non-negligible perpendicular hyperfine tensor components that narrow the choice of C-13 nuclear spin qubits. We address these issues by presenting protocols based on synchronization effects that allow for a complete suppression of both error sources in state-of-the-art CNOT gate schemes. This is possible by a suitable choice of parameter sets that incorporate the error into the scheme instead of avoiding it. These results contribute to the recent progress toward scalable quantum computation with defects in solids.

SO PHYSICAL REVIEW D
AB We perform digital quantum simulation, using a classical simulator, to study screening and confinement in a gauge theory with a topological term, focusing on (1 + 1)-dimensional quantum electrodynamics (Schwinger model) with a theta term. We compute the ground state energy in the presence of probe charges to estimate the potential between them, via adiabatic state preparation. We compare our simulation results and analytical predictions for a finite volume, finding good agreements. In particular our result in the massive case shows a linear behavior for noninteger charges and a nonlinear behavior for integer charges, consistently with the expected confinement (screening) behavior for noninteger (integer) charges.

TI Cryptographic security concerns on timestamp sharing via a public
   channel in quantum-key-distribution systems
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Quantum-key-distribution protocols are known to be vulnerable against a side channel attack that exploits the time difference in detectors??? responses used to obtain key bits. The recommended solution against this timing side channel attack is to use a large time bin width instead of high-resolution timing information. A common notion is that using a large bin width reduces the resolution of detectors??? responses, hence supposedly minimizes the information leakage to an eavesdropper. We challenge this conventional wisdom and demonstrate that increasing the bin width does not monotonically reduce the mutual information between the key bits and the eavesdropper???s observation of detectors??? responses. Instead of randomly increasing the bin width, it should be carefully chosen because the mutual information fluctuates with respect to the bin width. We also examine the effect of full width half maximums (FWHMs) of the detectors??? responses on the mutual information and show that decreasing the FWHM increases the mutual information. Lastly, the start time of binning is also shown to be important in the binning process and the mutual information fluctuates periodically with respect to it.

TI Optimized DenseNet121 and Quantum PennyLane Fusion for Explainable Skin
   Disease Recognition and Classification
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB The accurate diagnosis of skin diseases, particularly in distinguishing between visually similar conditions such as Measles, Monkeypox, Chickenpox, and Normal skin states, remains a critical challenge in clinical dermatology. To address this, we propose a novel hybrid framework that seamlessly integrates classical convolutional neural networks (CNNs) with quantum computing principles for enhanced multi-class classification. Our approach utilizes DenseNet121 as the backbone feature extractor, which is then coupled with a quantum-enhanced classifier implemented using the PennyLane framework. This fusion not only improves classification accuracy but also ensures interpretability, a key requirement in medical diagnostics. To further enhance transparency and trust, we incorporate multiple Explainable AI (XAI) techniques, including SHAP, LIME, Grad-CAM, and XRAI, to provide both pixel-level visualizations and region-based annotations through bounding boxes that highlight infection zones. An embedding-based image recognition module is also introduced to retrieve visually similar cases from a database, aiding clinicians in comparative analysis and decision-making. We employ Optuna-based hyperparameter optimization to fine-tune the CNN components, achieving a validation accuracy exceeding 91.5% on a dataset of 770 real-world skin lesion images. The robustness of our pipeline is validated through rigorous random sampling and multi-class evaluation. This work demonstrates the potential of combining quantum machine learning with interpretable CNNs to advance medical image analysis in dermatology, offering a system that balances performance, transparency, and clinical utility.

Two reservoir particles, initially prepared in a thermal state or a state with coherence, are correlated through a unitary transformation and afterward interact locally with the two quantum subsystems. We study the quantum effect of reservoir on synchronous dynamics of system. By preparing different reservoir initial states or manipulating the reservoir particles coupling and the temperature gradient, we find that quantum entanglement of reservoir is the key to control quantum synchronization of system qubits.

TI Provable bounds for noise-free expectation values computed from noisy
   samples
SO NATURE COMPUTATIONAL SCIENCE
AB Quantum computing has emerged as a powerful computational paradigm capable of solving problems beyond the reach of classical computers. However, today's quantum computers are noisy, posing challenges to obtaining accurate results. Here, we explore the impact of noise on quantum computing, focusing on the challenges in sampling bit strings from noisy quantum computers and the implications for optimization and machine learning. We formally quantify the sampling overhead to extract good samples from noisy quantum computers and relate it to the layer fidelity, a metric to determine the performance of noisy quantum processors. Further, we show how this allows us to use the conditional value at risk of noisy samples to determine provable bounds on noise-free expectation values. We discuss how to leverage these bounds for different algorithms and demonstrate our findings through experiments on real quantum computers involving up to 127 qubits. The results show strong alignment with theoretical predictions.
   In this study, the authors investigate the impact of noise on quantum computing with a focus on the challenges in sampling bit strings from noisy quantum computers, which has implications for optimization and machine learning.

TI Implementing graph-theoretic quantum algorithms on a silicon photonic
   quantum walk processor
SO SCIENCE ADVANCES
AB Applications of quantum walks can depend on the number, exchange symmetry and indistinguishability of the particles involved, and the underlying graph structures where they move. Here, we show that silicon photonics, by exploiting an entanglement-driven scheme, can realize quantum walks with full control over all these properties in one device. The device we realize implements entangled two-photon quantum walks on any five-vertex graph, with continuously tunable particle exchange symmetry and indistinguishability. We show how this simulates single-particle walks on larger graphs, with size and geometry controlled by tuning the properties of the composite quantum walkers. We apply the device to quantum walk algorithms for searching vertices in graphs and testing for graph isomorphisms. In doing so, we implement up to 100 sampled time steps of quantum walk evolution on each of 292 different graphs. This opens the way to large-scale, programmable quantum walk processors for classically intractable applications.

TI A Cryo-BiCMOS Controller for Quantum Computers based on Trapped
   Beryllium Ions
SO IEEE JOURNAL OF SOLID-STATE CIRCUITS
AB This article presents a cryo-BiCMOS system on chip (SoC) designed for single and two-qubit gate operations for quantum computers (QCs) based on beryllium trapped-ions (TIs). Signal generation from 0.7 to 1.6 GHz is supported, covering all microwave transitions in a Be-9(+) QC realization. An integrated 48-kbit waveform memory is implemented for improved two-qubit gate fidelity. The fabricated IC is verified in a 4 K environment with up to 4 qubits, thus enabling quantum processor unit (QPU) cointegration. IC operation up to RT ensures compatibility with future system realizations. Measurements demonstrate qubit state control with an oscillation amplitude of 94% before SPAM correction and Rabi oscillation rate of 172 kHz. Evaluations of long sequences of sigma(x) gates indicate control of the quantum state with high quality. Interaction with one computational zone is possible at a total power consumption of 86 mW translating to 21.5 mW/qubit in the presented measurements. Comparison with the state-of-the-art controller reveals drastic power and form-factor reduction at comparable performance, thus paving the way for a scalable TI platform. The chip is fabricated in a 0.13-mu m SiGe BiCMOS technology. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first reported from-scratch system design for TI-based QC concluding with a qubit state manipulation demonstration.

TI Meta-Variational Quantum Eigensolver: Learning Energy Profiles of
   Parameterized Hamiltonians for Quantum Simulation
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB We present the meta-variational quantum eigensolver (VQE), an algorithm capable of learning the ground-state energy profile of a parameterized Hamiltonian. If the meta-VQE is trained with a few data points, it delivers an initial circuit parameterization that can be used to compute the ground-state energy of any parameterization of the Hamiltonian within a certain trust region. We test this algorithm with an XXZ spin chain, an electronic H-4 Hamiltonian, and a single-transmon quantum simulation. In all cases, the meta-VQE is able to learn the shape of the energy functional and, in some cases, it results in improved accuracy in comparison with individual VQE optimization. The meta-VQE algorithm introduces both a gain in efficiency for parameterized Hamiltonians in terms of the number of optimizations and a good starting point for the quantum circuit parameters for individual optimizations. The proposed algorithm can be readily mixed with other improvements in the field of variational algorithms to shorten the distance between the current state of the art and applications with quantum advantage.

TI The Dirac Equation in a Linear Potential and Quantized Electromagnetic
   Field: Spin-Rest Entanglement
SO QUANTUM REPORTS
AB We derive the exact eigenfunctions and energy equation for a Dirac particle in a monochromatic quantized electromagnetic plane wave and a confining scalar linear potential. It is shown that the system's energy spectrum exhibits a forbidden region that vanishes when the particle-field interaction is switched off. We then analyze the effect of particle-field coupling on quantum entanglement between the particle's spin and the remaining degrees of freedom. Our results show that the profile of the spin-rest entanglement, measured by negativity and Von Neumann entropy, follows the energy profile of the state: it is monotonic when the energy is monotonic, and non-monotonic otherwise. These results may provide insights into quantum correlations in Dirac-like systems describing low-energy excitations of graphene and trapped ions.

TI Proof-of-principle demonstration of free space semi-quantum key

SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB Semi-quantum key distribution (SQKD) allows a quantum user and a classical user to share a string of secret keys, providing support for application scenarios that cannot withstand the high cost of quantum resources. In this paper, we propose what we believe to be the first proof-of-principle experimental demonstration of free space SQKD based on the single-state protocol, which is equipped with polarization encoding scheme employing the method of selective modulation. During the half-hour test time for each operation, the overall experiment obtained the original key rate of 107.2 kbps at the repetition frequency of 100 MHz, and the average bit error rate was determined to be 1.65% for CTRL operation and 0.64% for SIFT operation. The experimental results indicate that our system exhibits commendable performance and stability at a low bit error rate that represents a significant initial stride toward the future practical deployment of SQKD systems within free-space channels.

TI Absolute fully entangled fraction from spectrum
SO EUROPEAN PHYSICAL JOURNAL D
AB Fully entangled fraction (FEF) is a significant figure of merit for density matrices. In bipartite d circle plus d quantum systems, the threshold value FEF > 1/d, carries significant implications for quantum information processing tasks. Like separability, the value of FEF is also related to the choice of global basis of the underlying Hilbert space. A state having its FEF <= 1/d, might give a value > 1/d in another global basis. A change in the global basis corresponds to a global unitary action on the quantum state. In the present work, we find that there are quantum states whose FEF remains less than 1/d, under the action of any global unitary, i.e., any choice of global basis. We invoke the hyperplane separation theorem to demarcate the set from states whose FEF can be increased beyond 1/d through global unitary action. Consequent to this, we probe the marginals of a pure three party system in qubits. We observe that under some restrictions on the parameters, even if two parties collaborate (through unitary action on their combined system) they will not be able to breach the FEF threshold. The study is further extended to include some classes of mixed three qubit and three qutrit systems. Furthermore, the implications of our work pertaining to k-copy nonlocality and teleportation are also investigated.

TI Security Analysis of Quantum Key Distribution with Small Block Length
   and Its Application to Quantum Space Communications
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB The security of real-world quantum key distribution (QKD) critically depends on the number of data points the system can collect in a finite time interval. To date, state-of-the-art finite-key security analyses require block lengths in the order of 104 bits to obtain positive secret keys. This requirement, however, can be very difficult to achieve in practice, especially in the case of entanglement-based satellite QKD, where the overall channel loss can go up to 70 dB or more. Here, we provide an improved finite-key security analysis which reduces the block length requirement by 14% to 17% for standard channel and protocol settings. In practical terms, this reduction could save entanglement-based satellite QKD weeks of measurement time and resources, thereby bringing space-based QKD technology closer to reality. As an application, we use the improved analysis to show that the recently reported Micius QKD satellite is capable of generating positive secret keys with a 10(-5) security level.

TI Theory and computation of Markovian quantum antenna systems
SO RESULTS IN PHYSICS
AB We describe a general framework for the modeling and analysis of Markovian quantum antenna systems viewed as a special problem in quantum stochastic dynamics. The quantum radiator, which can be used to spatially direct radiated quantum states in future quantum communication systems, is modeled as an open quantum system capable of controlling the composition of its radiation modes through external source manipulations while in continuous interaction with the surrounding thermal and random environments. Our analysis and computational methods are based on deploying the Gorini-Kossakowski-Sudarshan-Lindblad (GKSL) master equation to account for environment-induced jump processes such as quantum dissipation and decoherence. We construct a definition of the quantum antenna directivity inspired by the corresponding formulas in classical antenna theory and present several versions of the quantum directivity formula. As a computational example, we study the flow of the density operator of a coupled two-level quantum dot (qubit) array, excited by classical external signals with variable amplitude and phase, which is evolved in time using the quantum master equation. It is shown that by manipulating the amplitude and phase excitations of individual quantum dots, one may significantly enhance the directive radiation properties of the Markovian quantum antenna system.

TI A Comprehensive Review of Cybersecurity Threats to Wireless
   Infocommunications in the Quantum-Age Cryptography
SO IOT
AB The dynamic growth in the dependence of numerous industrial sectors, businesses, and critical infrastructure on infocommunication technologies necessitates the enhancement of their resilience to cyberattacks and radio-frequency threats. This article addresses a relevant scientific and applied issue, which is to formulate prospective directions for improving the effectiveness of cybersecurity approaches for infocommunication networks through a comparative analysis and logical synthesis of the state-of-the-art of applied research on cyber threats to the information security of mobile and satellite networks, including those related to the rapid development of quantum computing technologies. The article presents results on the systematisation of cyberattacks at the physical, signalling and cryptographic levels, as well as threats to cryptographic protocols and authentication systems. Particular attention is given to the prospects for implementing post-quantum cryptography, hybrid cryptographic models and the integration of threat detection mechanisms based on machine learning and artificial intelligence algorithms. The article proposes a classification of current threats according to architectural levels, analyses typical protocol vulnerabilities in next-generation mobile networks and satellite communications, and identifies key research gaps in existing cybersecurity approaches. Based on a critical analysis of scientific and applied literature, this article identifies key areas for future research. These include developing lightweight cryptographic algorithms, standardising post-quantum cryptographic models, creating adaptive cybersecurity frameworks and optimising protection mechanisms for resource-constrained devices within information and digital networks.

TI Security of the Decoy-State BB84 Protocol with Imperfect State
   Preparation
SO ENTROPY
AB The quantum key distribution (QKD) allows two remote users to share a common information-theoretic secure secret key. In order to guarantee the security of a practical QKD implementation, the physical system has to be fully characterized and all deviations from the ideal protocol due to various imperfections of realistic devices have to be taken into account in the security proof. In this work, we study the security of the efficient decoy-state BB84 QKD protocol in the presence of the source flaws, caused by imperfect intensity and polarization modulation. We investigate the non-Poissonian photon-number statistics due to coherent-state intensity fluctuations and the basis-dependence of the source due to non-ideal polarization state preparation. The analysis is supported by the experimental characterization of intensity and phase distributions.

TI Kagome qubit ice
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB A kagome lattice spin-ice system is created with the superconducting qubits of a quantum annealer, and shown to exhibit a field-induced kinetic crossover between spin-liquid phases. Specifically, kinetics within both the Ice-I phase and the unconventional field-induced Ice-II phase are presented.
   Topological phases of spin liquids with constrained disorder can host a kinetics of fractionalized excitations. However, spin-liquid phases with distinct kinetic regimes have proven difficult to observe experimentally. Here we present a realization of kagome spin ice in the superconducting qubits of a quantum annealer, and use it to demonstrate a field-induced kinetic crossover between spin-liquid phases. Employing fine control over local magnetic fields, we show evidence of both the Ice-I phase and an unconventional field-induced Ice-II phase. In the latter, a charge-ordered yet spin-disordered topological phase, the kinetics proceeds via pair creation and annihilation of strongly correlated, charge conserving, fractionalized excitations. As these kinetic regimes have resisted characterization in other artificial spin ice realizations, our results demonstrate the utility of quantum-driven kinetics in advancing the study of topological phases of spin liquids.

TI On genuine entanglement for tripartite systems
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF QUANTUM INFORMATION
AB In this paper, we investigate the genuine entanglement in tripartite systems based on partial transposition and the norm of correlation tensors of the density matrices. We first derive an analytical sufficient criterion to detect genuine entanglement of tripartite qubit states combining with the partial transposition of the density matrices. Then, we use the norm of correlation tensors to study genuine entanglement for tripartite qudit quantum states and obtain a genuine entanglement criterion by constructing certain matrices. With detailed examples, our results are seen to be able to detect more genuine tripartite entangled states than previous studies.

TI Adaptive quantum approximate optimization algorithm for solving
   combinatorial problems on a quantum computer
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB The quantum approximate optimization algorithm (QAOA) is a hybrid variational quantum-classical algorithm that solves combinatorial optimization problems. While there is evidence suggesting that the fixed form of the standard QAOA Ansatz is not optimal, there is no systematic approach for finding better Ansatze. We address this problem by developing an iterative version of QAOA that is problem tailored, and which can also be adapted to specific hardware constraints. We simulate the algorithm on a class of Max-Cut graph problems and show that it converges much faster than the standard QAOA, while simultaneously reducing the required number of CNOT gates and optimization parameters. We provide evidence that this speedup is connected to the concept of shortcuts to adiabaticity.

TI Disti-Mator, an entanglement distillation-based state estimator
SO COMMUNICATIONS PHYSICS
AB Minimizing both experimental effort and consumption of valuable quantum resources in state estimation is vital in practical quantum information processing. Typically, estimation protocols are independently implemented from other protocols, incurring additional resource cost. Here, we explore the estimation of states as an additional benefit of entanglement distillation protocols. We show that the Bell-diagonal parameters of any undistilled state can be efficiently estimated solely from the measurement statistics of probabilistic distillation protocols. We further introduce the distillation-based state estimator 'Disti-Mator' designed for a realistic experimental setting, and exhibit its robustness through numerical simulations. Our results demonstrate that a separate estimation protocol can be circumvented whenever distillation is an indispensable communication-based task.

TI Influence of Source Parameters on the Polarization Properties of Beams
   for Practical Free-Space Quantum Key Distribution
SO ENTROPY
AB Polarization encoding has been extensively used in quantum key distribution (QKD) implementations along free-space links. However, the calculation model to characterize channel transmittance and quantum bit error rate (QBER) for free-space QKD has not been systematically studied. As a result, it is often assumed that misalignment error is equal to a fixed value, which is not theoretically rigorous. In this paper, we investigate the depolarization and rotation of the signal beams resulting from spatially-dependent polarization effects of the use of curved optics in an off-axis configuration, where decoherence can be characterized by the Huygens-Fresnel principle and the cross-spectral density matrix (CSDM). The transmittance and misalignment error in a practical free-space QKD can thus be estimated using the method. Furthermore, the numerical simulations clearly show that the polarization effect caused by turbulence can be effectively mitigated when maintaining good beam coherence properties.

TI Measuring Incompatibility and Clustering Quantum Observables with a
   Quantum Switch
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB The existence of incompatible observables is a cornerstone of quantum mechanics and a valuable resource in quantum technologies. Here we introduce a measure of incompatibility, called the mutual eigenspace disturbance (MED), which quantifies the amount of disturbance induced by the measurement of a sharp observable on the eigenspaces of another. The MED provides a metric on the space of von Neumann measurements, and can be efficiently estimated by letting the measurement processes act in an indefinite order, using a setup known as the quantum switch, which also allows one to quantify the noncommutativity of arbitrary quantum processes. Thanks to these features, the MED can be used in quantum machine learning tasks. We demonstrate this application by providing an unsupervised algorithm that clusters unknown von Neumann measurements. Our algorithm is robust to noise and can be used to identify groups of observers that share approximately the same measurement context.

TI Security of round-robin differential-phase-shift
   quantum-key-distribution protocol with correlated light sources
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Among various quantum-key-distribution (QKD) protocols, the round-robin differential-phase- shift (RRDPS) protocol has a unique feature where its security is guaranteed without monitoring the signal disturbance. Moreover, this protocol has the remarkable property of being robust against source imperfections, assuming that the emitted pulses are independent. Unfortunately, some experiments with high-speed QKD systems confirmed the violation of the independence due to pulse correlations, and therefore the lack of a security proof, without taking into account this effect is an obstacle for guaranteeing the implementation security. In this paper, we show that the RRDPS protocol is secure against any source imperfections by establishing a security proof with the pulse correlations. The proof is simple in the sense that we make only three experimentally simple assumptions on the source. Our numerical simulation based on the proof shows that the long-range pulse correlation does not cause a significant impact on the key rate, which reveals another striking feature of the RRDPS protocol. Our security proof is thus effective and applicable to a wide range of practical sources and paves the way to realizing truly secure QKD in high-speed systems.

We propose a simple scheme for certifying any set of d-outcome projective measurements which do not share any common invariant proper subspace, termed here genuinely incompatible, and the maximally entangled state of two qudits. For our purpose, we focus on a simpler scenario, termed as a one-sided device-independent scenario where the resource employed for certification is quantum steering. We also study the robustness of our self-testing statements for a certain class of genuinely incompatible measurements including mutually unbiased bases which are essential for several quantum information-theoretic tasks such as quantum cryptography.

TI All-day free-space quantum key distribution with thermal source towards

SO NPJ QUANTUM INFORMATION
AB Unmanned vehicles (UV) demand highly secure communication system with high-cost-effectiveness. Bypassing the use of quantum coherent source and active modulations, passive-state-preparation (PSP) continuous-variable quantum key distribution (CVQKD) with thermal source provides a favorable solution for all-day cryptography communication between UVs. However, the field experiment of free-space PSP CVQKD has still not been realized due to the lack of efficient excess noise suppression techniques via high-loss free-space channels. Here, we realize the PSP CVQKD field test over an urban free-space channel with record-breaking attenuation from -12.24 dB to -15.59 dB. Specifically, a novel scheme is proposed to reduce excess noise from PSP, and efficient quantum coherence detection alongside advanced digital signal processing algorithms is developed to achieve low-noise synchronized raw data acquisition. The secure keys are successfully generated, with statistical summation values of 0.85 kbps during the day and 1.52 kbps at night, proving the viability for UV secure communication.

TI Quantum alternating operator ansatz with PSO optimizer for portfolio
   optimization problem
SO APPLIED SOFT COMPUTING
AB Recently, Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) and Quantum Alternating Operator ansatz (QAOAz) are utilized to solve the Mean Variance (MV) model for the portfolio optimization problem (QAOAz-MV), which shows performance advantages over classical algorithms on this huge search space. For the more complex and comprehensive risk parity (RP) model, a novel QAOAz solution (QAOAz-RP) is proposed. We begin by defining the RP model for the portfolio optimization problem. Next, we detail the QAOAz algorithm process, where the problem Hamiltonian with the ZZZZ term is derived, the corresponding quantum circuit is ingeniously constructed using the parity check method, and the whole quantum circuit containing the ring XYmixer is given. Finally, to improve the optimization performance of QAOAz, a Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) optimizer is introduced to tune the parameters of the quantum circuits, which is applicable to both QAOAz-MV and QAOAz-RP. The experiment conducted on multiple financial markets (e.g. Chinese, U.S., and European) demonstrate that PSO-QAOAz-RP is significantly better for portfolio optimization than ABC-LP, GWO, GA and QAOAz-RP on eight portfolios in all metrics. PSO-QAOAz-MV also has advantage for MV model over the quantum algorithms, including QAOA (improves approximate ratio by 54.79% on average) and QAOAz (improves approximate ratio by 15.38% on average). This study not only provides a breakthrough quantum solution for portfolio optimization, but also provides a reusable technology paradigm for the deep integration of quantum computing and financial engineering.

TI Anisotropic exchange interaction of two hole-spin qubits
SO NATURE PHYSICS
AB Semiconductor spin qubits offer the potential to employ industrial transistor technology to produce large-scale quantum computers. Silicon hole spin qubits benefit from fast all-electrical qubit control and sweet spots to counteract charge and nuclear spin noise. However, the demonstration of a two-qubit interaction has remained an open challenge. One missing factor is an understanding of the exchange coupling in the presence of a strong spin-orbit interaction. Here we study two hole-spin qubits in a silicon fin field-effect transistor, the workhorse device of today's semiconductor industry. We demonstrate electrical tunability of the exchange splitting from above 500 MHz to close-to-off and perform a conditional spin-flip in 24 ns. The exchange is anisotropic because of the spin-orbit interaction. Upon tunnelling from one quantum dot to the other, the spin is rotated by almost 180 degrees. The exchange Hamiltonian no longer has the Heisenberg form and can be engineered such that it enables two-qubit controlled rotation gates without a trade-off between speed and fidelity. This ideal behaviour applies over a wide range of magnetic field orientations, rendering the concept robust with respect to variations from qubit to qubit, indicating that it is a suitable approach for realizing a large-scale quantum computer.
   A successful silicon spin qubit design should be rapidly scalable by benefiting from industrial transistor technology. This investigation of exchange interactions between two FinFET qubits provides a guide to implementing two-qubit gates for hole spins.

TI Measurement-Induced Levy Flights of Quantum Information
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB We explore a model of free fermions in one dimension, subject to frustrated (noncommuting) local measurements across adjacent sites, which resolves the fermions into nonorthogonal orbitals, misaligned from the underlying lattice. For maximal misalignment, superdiffusive behavior emerges from the vanishing of the measurement-induced quasiparticle decay rate at one point in the Brillouin zone, which generates fractal-scaling entanglement entropy S proportional to l1/3 for a subsystem of length l. We derive an effective nonlinear sigma model with long-range couplings responsible for Levy flights in entanglement propagation, which we confirm with large-scale numerical simulations. When the misalignment is reduced, the entanglement exhibits, with increasing l, consecutive regimes of superdiffusive, S proportional to l1/3, diffusive, S proportional to ln l, and localized, S = const, behavior. Our findings show how intricate fractal-scaling entanglement can be produced for local Hamiltonians and measurements.

TI Quantum sensing of broadband spin dynamics and magnon transport in
   antiferromagnets
SO SCIENCE ADVANCES
AB Optical detection of magnetic resonance using quantum spin sensors (QSSs) provides a spatially local and sensitive technique to probe spin dynamics in magnets. However, its utility as a probe of antiferromagnetic resonance (AFMR) remains an open question. We report the experimental demonstration of optically detected AFMR in layered van der Waals antiferromagnets (AFM) up to frequencies of 24 gigahertz. We leverage QSS spin relaxation due to low-frequency magnetic field fluctuations arising from collective dynamics of magnons excited by the uniform AFMR mode. First, through AFMR spectroscopy, we characterize the intrinsic exchange fields and magnetic anisotropies of the AFM. Second, using the localized sensitivity of the QSS, we demonstrate magnon transport over tens of micrometers. Last, we find that optical detection efficiency increases with increasing frequency. This showcases the dual capabilities of QSS as detectors of high-frequency magnetization dynamics and magnon transport, paving the way for understanding and controlling the magnetism of antiferromagnets.

TI Phases of 2D massless QCD with qubit regularization
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW D
AB We investigate the possibility of reproducing the continuum physics of 2D SU(N) gauge theory coupled to a single flavor of massless Dirac fermion using qubit regularization. The continuum theory is described by N free fermions in the ultraviolet (UV) and a coset Wess-Zumino-Witten (WZW) model in the infrared (IR). In this work, we first explore how well these features can be reproduced using the Kogut-Susskind (KS) Hamiltonian with a finite-dimensional link Hilbert space and a generalized Hubbard coupling. We do this by analyzing the renormalization group (RG) flow diagram of the continuum theory and identifying important phases of the theory. Using strong coupling expansions, we show that our lattice model exhibits a gapped dimer phase and a spin-chain phase. Furthermore, for N = 2, using tensor network methods, we show that there is a second-order phase transition between these two phases, which we identify as the critical surface of the continuum theory that connects the IR and UV fixed points. In the IR, we identify the critical theory at the transition as the expected SU(2)1 WZW model. Lastly, we argue that modifications of our model may allow the study of the UV physics of free fermions.

AB The expansion of Fiber-To-The-Home (FTTH) networks creates high costs due to expensive excavation procedures. Optimizing the planning process and minimizing the cost of the earth excavation work therefore lead to large savings. Mathematically, the FTTH network problem can be described as a minimum Steiner Tree problem. Even though the Steiner Tree problem has already been investigated intensively in the last decades, it might be further optimized with the help of new computing paradigms and emerging approaches. This work studies upcoming technologies, such as Quantum Annealing, Simulated Annealing and nature-inspired methods like Evolutionary Algorithms or slime-mold-based optimization. Additionally, we investigate partitioning and simplifying methods. Evaluated on several real-life problem instances, we could outperform a traditional, widely-used baseline (NetworkX Approximate Solver (Hagberg et al., 2008)) on most of the domains. Prior partitioning of the initial graph and the slime-mold-based approach were especially valuable for a cost-efficient approximation. Quantum Annealing seems promising, but was limited by the number of available qubits.

TI Quantum sensing of acceleration and rotation by interfering magnetically
   launched atoms
SO SCIENCE ADVANCES
AB Accurate and stable measurement of inertial quantities is essential in geophysics, geodesy, fundamental physics, and inertial navigation. Here, we present an architecture for a compact cold-atom accelerometer-gyroscope based on a magnetically launched atom interferometer. Characterizing the launching technique, we demonstrate 700-parts per million gyroscope scale factor stability over 1 day, while acceleration and rotation rate bias stabilities of 7 x 10-7 meters per second squared and 4 x 10-7 radians per second are reached after 2 days of integration of the cold-atom sensor. Hybridizing it with a classical accelerometer and gyroscope, we correct their drift and bias to achieve respective 100-fold and 3-fold increase on the stability of the hybridized sensor compared to the classical ones. Compared to a state-of-the-art atomic gyroscope, the simplicity and scalability of our launching technique make this architecture easily extendable to a compact full six-axis inertial measurement unit, providing a pathway toward autonomous positioning and orientation using cold-atom sensors.

AB We initiate a study to overview and compare quantum software development kits (QSDKs) in terms of their usability for introductory level quantum education. In this work, we focus on Qiskit, ProjectQ, Cirq, and Forest. For comparison, we define six tasks based on QWorld's introductory tutorial called Bronze. We implement each task on these QSDKs. Besides, we check how easy it is to install them. According to our results, not every QSDK comes as a stand-alone Python package. This may create certain installation and execution problems. Visualization of quantum circuits may be poor or fail in some case. For the rest of tasks, all QSDKs are sufficient to work with.

TI Geometric Optimization of Nonequilibrium Adiabatic Thermal Machines and

SO PRX QUANTUM
AB We adopt a geometric approach to describe the performance of adiabatic quantum machines, operating under slow time-dependent driving and in contact with two reservoirs with a temperature bias during all the cycle. We show that the problem of optimizing the power generation of a heat engine and the efficiency of both the heat engine and refrigerator operational modes is reduced to an isoperimetric problem with nontrivial underlying metrics and curvature. This corresponds to the maximization of the ratio between the area enclosed by a closed curve and its corresponding length. We illustrate this procedure in a qubit coupled to two reservoirs operating as a thermal machine by means of an adiabatic protocol.

TI Minimal scenario facet Bell inequalities for multi-qubit states
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF QUANTUM INFORMATION
AB Facet inequalities play an important role in detecting the nonlocality of a quantum state. The number of such inequalities depends on the Bell test scenario. With the increase in the number of parties, measurement outcomes, or/and the number of measurement settings, there are more nontrivial facet inequalities. For several Bell scenarios, by involving two dichotomic measurement settings for two parties and one dichotomic measurement by other parties, we show that the local polytope has only one nontrivial facet. For three parties, we have three variants of this inequality, depending upon which party is doing one dichotomic measurement. This measurement scenario for a multipartite state may be considered as the minimal scenario involving multipartite correlations that can detect nonlocality. We show that this inequality is violated by all generalized GHZ states. Being the only facet Bell inequality, this inequality is also violated by any entangled three-qubit pure state. We also show that for noisy W states, our inequality is more effective than the well-known Mermin inequality.

TI Optimization Landscape of Quantum Control Systems
SO COMPLEX SYSTEM MODELING AND SIMULATION
AB Optimization is ubiquitous in the control of quantum dynamics in atomic, molecular, and optical systems. The ease or difficulty of finding control solutions, which is practically crucial for developing quantum technologies, is highly dependent on the geometry of the underlying optimization landscapes. In this review, we give an introduction to the basic concepts in the theory of quantum optimal control landscapes, and their trap-free critical topology under two fundamental assumptions. Furthermore, the effects of various factors on the search effort are discussed, including control constraints, singularities, saddles, noises, and non-topological features of the landscapes. Additionally, we review recent experimental advances in the control of molecular and spin systems. These results provide an overall understanding of the optimization complexity of quantum control dynamics, which may help to develop more efficient optimization algorithms for quantum control systems, and as a promising extension, the training processes in quantum machine learning.

SO NANO LETTERS
AB Spin-based silicon quantum dots are an attractive qubit technology for quantum information processing with respect to coherence time, control, and engineering. Here we present an exchange-only Si qubit device platform that combines the throughput of CMOS-like wafer processing with the versatility of direct-write lithography. The technology, which we coin "SLEDGE", features dot-shaped gates that are patterned simultaneously on one topographical plane and subsequently connected by vias to interconnect metal lines. The process design enables nontrivial layouts as well as flexibility in gate dimensions, material selection, and additional device features such as for rf qubit control. We show that the SLEDGE process has reduced electrostatic disorder with respect to traditional overlapping gate devices with lift-off metallization, and we present spin coherent exchange oscillations and single qubit blind randomized benchmarking data.

TI Maximizing Local Rewards on Multi-Agent Quantum Games through
   Gradient-Based Learning Strategies
SO ENTROPY
AB This article delves into the complex world of quantum games in multi-agent settings, proposing a model wherein agents utilize gradient-based strategies to optimize local rewards. A learning model is introduced to focus on the learning efficacy of agents in various games and the impact of quantum circuit noise on the performance of the algorithm. The research uncovers a non-trivial relationship between quantum circuit noise and algorithm performance. While generally an increase in quantum noise leads to performance decline, we show that low noise can unexpectedly enhance performance in games with large numbers of agents under some specific circumstances. This insight not only bears theoretical interest, but also might have practical implications given the inherent limitations of contemporary noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) computers. The results presented in this paper offer new perspectives on quantum games and enrich our understanding of the interplay between multi-agent learning and quantum computation. Both challenges and opportunities are highlighted, suggesting promising directions for future research in the intersection of quantum computing, game theory and reinforcement learning.

TI qblaze: An Efficient and Scalable Sparse Quantum Simulator
SO PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACM ON PROGRAMMING LANGUAGES-PACMPL
AB Classical simulation of quantum circuits is critical for the development of implementations of quantum algorithms: it does not require access to specialized hardware, facilitates debugging by allowing direct access to the quantum state, and is the only way to test on inputs that are too big for current NISQ computers. Many quantum algorithms rely on invariants that result in sparsity in the state vector. A sparse state vector simulator only computes with non-zero amplitudes. For important classes of algorithms, this results in an asymptotic improvement in simulation time. While promising prior work has investigated ways to exploit sparsity, it is still unclear what is the best way to scale sparse simulation to modern multi-core architectures. In this work, we address this challenge and present qblaze, a highly optimized sparse state vector simulator based on (i) a compact sorted array representation, and (ii) new, easily parallelizable and highly-scalable algorithms for all quantum operations. Our extensive experimental evaluation shows that qblaze is often orders-of-magnitude more efficient than prior sparse state vector simulators even on a single thread, and also that qblaze scales well to a large number of CPU cores. Overall, our work enables testing quantum algorithms on input sizes that were previously out of reach.

TI Improved lattice-based mix-nets for electronic voting
SO IET INFORMATION SECURITY
AB Mix-networks were first proposed by Chaum in the late 1970s-early 1980s as a general tool for building anonymous communication systems. Classical mix-net implementations rely on standard public key primitives (e.g., ElGamal encryption) that will become vulnerable when a sufficiently powerful quantum computer will be built. Thus, there is a need to develop quantum-resistant mix-nets. This article focuses on the application case of electronic voting where the number of votes to be mixed may reach hundreds of thousands or even millions. We propose an improved architecture for lattice-based post-quantum mix-nets featuring more efficient zero-knowledge proofs while maintaining established security assumptions. Our current implementation scales up to 100,000 votes, still leaving a lot of room for future optimisation.

TI Causal Networks and Freedom of Choice in Bell's Theorem
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB Bell's theorem is typically understood as the proof that quantum theory is incompatible with local hidden-variable models. More generally, we can see the violation of a Bell inequality as witnessing the impossibility of explaining quantum correlations with classical causal models. The violation of a Bell inequality, however, does not exclude classical models where some level of measurement dependence is allowed, that is, the choice made by observers can be correlated with the source generating the systems to be measured. Here, we show that the level of measurement dependence can be quantitatively upper bounded if we arrange the Bell test within a network. Furthermore, we also prove that these results can be adapted in order to derive nonlinear Bell inequalities for a large class of causal networks and to identify quantumly realizable correlations that violate them.

TI Quantum computation of thermal averages for a non-Abelian D4 lattice
   gauge theory via quantum Metropolis sampling
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW D
AB In this paper, we show the application of the quantum Metropolis sampling (QMS) algorithm to a toy gauge theory with discrete non-Abelian gauge group D4 in (2 + 1)-dimensions, discussing in general how some components of hybrid quantum-classical algorithms should be adapted in the case of gauge theories. In particular, we discuss the construction of random unitary operators which preserve gauge invariance and act transitively on the physical Hilbert space, constituting an ergodic set of quantum Metropolis moves between gauge invariant eigenspaces, and introduce a protocol for gauge invariant measurements. Furthermore, we show how a finite resolution in the energy measurements distorts the energy and plaquette distribution measured via QMS, and propose a heuristic model that takes into account part of the deviations between numerical results and exact analytical results, whose discrepancy tends to vanish by increasing the number of qubits used for the energy measurements.

TI Fiber-based double-pass single-crystal photon-pair source for quantum
   key distribution in a network
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW APPLIED
AB Entanglement-based quantum key distribution (QKD) protocols require robust and stable photon-pair sources in terms of high heralding efficiencies or photon-pair generation rates even under harsh environmental conditions, e.g., when operated in the field. Here we report on a type-0 spontaneous parametric down-conversion photon source in periodically poled crystals based on simultaneous operation of second harmonic generation and spontaneous parametric down-conversion (SPDC) in a double-pass configuration within the same nonlinear crystal, further simplifying the hardware requirements of SPDC photon sources. Our source is flexible, tunable, alignment-free, relatively broadband, and completely fiber coupled. Its rack-compatible and modular setup allows a straightforward plug-and-play integration of coding modules, e.g., interferometers to enable various QKD protocols such as phase or phase-time coding. We compare the double-pass configuration with our single-pass type-II and type-0 SPDC source configurations. To evaluate the conversion efficiencies of our modules, we use data postprocessing to remove artifacts from detector after-pulsing and dead times of the detectors.

TI Detecting and protecting entanglement through nonlocality, variational
   entanglement witness, and nonlocal measurements
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB We propose an innovative method to enhance the detection and protection of quantum entanglement, a cornerstone of quantum mechanics with applications in computing, communication, and beyond. While entanglement can be represented through nonlocal correlations detectable by the Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt (CHSH) inequality, this method does not fully capture all entangled states. To address this limitation, we introduce a variational entanglement witness (VEW) that optimizes the probabilities of detection and improves the efficiency of distinguishing between separable and entangled states. Additionally, we propose a nonlocal measurement framework that enables the assessment of both CHSH inequalities and the VEW while preserving the entanglement. Our approach enhances the reliability of entanglement detection while maintaining the entanglement of quantum states, offering significant advancements for quantum technologies.

TI Integrating and Benchmarking KpqC in TLS/X.509
SO ELECTRONICS
AB Advances in quantum computing pose a fundamental threat to classical public-key cryptosystems, including RSA and elliptic-curve cryptography (ECC), which form the foundation for authentication and key exchange in the Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocol. In response to these emerging threats, Korea launched the KpqC (Korea Post-Quantum Cryptography) project in 2021 to design, evaluate, and standardize domestic PQC algorithms. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first systematic evaluation of the finalized Korean PQC algorithms (HAETAE, AIMer, SMAUG-T, NTRU+) within a production-grade TLS/X.509 stack, enabling direct comparison against NIST PQC and ECC baselines. To contextualize KpqC performance, we further compare against NIST-standardized PQC algorithms and classical ECC baselines. Our evaluation examines both static overhead (certificate size) and dynamic overhead (TLS 1.3 handshake latency) across computation-bound (localhost) and network-bound (LAN) scenarios, including embedded device and hybrid TLS configurations. Our results show that KpqC certificates are approximately 4.6-48.8x larger than ECC counterparts and generally exceed NIST PQC sizes. In computation-bound tests, both NIST PQC (ML-KEM) and KpqC hybrids exhibited similar handshake latency increases of approximately 8-9x relative to ECC. In network-bound tests, the difference between the two families was negligible, with relative overhead typically around 30-41%. These findings offer practical guidance for balancing security level, key size, packet size, and latency and support phased PQC migration strategies in real-world TLS deployments.

   beams
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB This article investigates the quadrupole excitation of a trapped atom exposed to the tightly focused Laguerre-Gaussian (LG) beams with parallel and antiparallel spin angular momentum (SAM) and orbital angular momentum (OAM) under nonparaxial conditions. The Rabi frequency profile of allowed quadrupole transition channels, modified by SAM and OAM interaction, in the focal plane is provided. In the case of antiparallel SAM and OAM, the excitation probability undergoes substantial modification due to the considerable contribution of longitudinal intensity variations in tightly focused condition. The findings offer insights into controlling localized atom transition, including OAM transfer, with potential applications in qudit-based technologies.

TI Finite-Size Analysis of Prepare-and-Measure and Decoy-State Quantum Key
   Distribution via Entropy Accumulation
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB An important goal in quantum key distribution (QKD) is the task of providing a finite-size security proof without the assumption of collective attacks. For prepare-and-measure QKD, one approach for obtaining such proofs is the generalized entropy-accumulation theorem (GEAT) but thus far it has only been applied to study a small selection of protocols. In this work, we present techniques for applying the GEAT in finite-size analysis of generic prepare-and-measure protocols, with a focus on decoy-state protocols. In particular, we present an improved approach for computing entropy bounds for decoy-state protocols, which has the dual benefits of providing tighter bounds than previous approaches (even asymptotically) and being compatible with methods for computing min-trade-off functions in the GEAT. Furthermore, we develop methods to incorporate some improvements to the finite-size terms in the GEAT and implement techniques to automatically optimize the min-trade-off function. Our approach also addresses some numerical-stability challenges specific to prepare-and-measure protocols, which have not been addressed in previous works.

TI Optical transmitter tunable over a 65-nm wavelength range around 1550 nm
   for quantum key distribution
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW APPLIED
AB The ability to create phase-controlled pulses of light with wavelength tunability has applications spanning quantum and classical communications networks. Traditionally, optical transmitters are able to either produce phase-controlled pulses at a fixed wavelength or require a chain of bulky and expensive external modulators to convert wavelength tunable continuous-wave light into optical pulses. One technology of great interest is quantum key distribution (QKD), a technology for generating perfectly random keys at remote nodes to ensure secure communications. Environments such as data centers, where the user needs change regularly, will require adaptability in the deployment of QKD to integrate into classical optical networks. Here we propose and demonstrate an alternative quantum transmitter design consisting of a multimodal Fabry-Perot laser optically injection locked by a wavelength tunable laser. The transmitter is able to produce phase-controlled optical pulses at GHz speeds with a tunable wavelength range of > 65 nm centered at 1550 nm. With this transmitter, we perform proof-of-principle QKD with secure bit rates of order Mb/s.

TI Quantum computing approach for multi-objective routing and spectrum
   assignment optimization
SO JOURNAL OF OPTICAL COMMUNICATIONS AND NETWORKING
AB Optimization problems are fundamental in a wide range of fields, including telecommunications, where efficient resource allocation is critical to ensure good network performance and high scalability. In the context of elastic optical networks (EONs), the multi-objective routing and spectrum assignment (MO-RSA) problem represents a key challenge, as it involves selecting a valid path and assigning frequency slots while fulfilling continuity and contiguity constraints and optimizing multiple conflicting objectives. This paper presents a novel, to the best of our knowledge, quantum-based approach to solving the MO-RSA problem. We first formulate the MO-RSA problem as a quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO) problem and then solve it using the quantum approximate optimization algorithm (QAOA). Our method accounts for both minimizing the total number of used links (or any non-negative additive metric) and maximizing the optical signal-to-noise ratio. For our simulations, we employed the Qiskit framework and IBM's sampler-based quantum backend to implement and test the proposed approach. Our results demonstrate that by encoding the MO-RSA problem into a QUBO model and optimizing it with QAOA, we achieved an approximation ratio of 88% and a computational complexity of $O({n<^>2})$, which represents a significant improvement over the exponential complexity of traditional integer linear programming methods.

TI Partial Boolean Functions With Exact Quantum Query Complexity One
SO ENTROPY
AB We provide two sufficient and necessary conditions to characterize any n-bit partial Boolean function with exact quantum query complexity 1. Using the first characterization, we present all n-bit partial Boolean functions that depend on n bits and can be computed exactly by a 1-query quantum algorithm. Due to the second characterization, we construct a function F that maps any n-bit partial Boolean function to some integer, and if an n-bit partial Boolean function f depends on k bits and can be computed exactly by a 1-query quantum algorithm, then F(f) is non-positive. In addition, we show that the number of all n-bit partial Boolean functions that depend on k bits and can be computed exactly by a 1-query quantum algorithm is not bigger than an upper bound depending on n and k. Most importantly, the upper bound is far less than the number of all n-bit partial Boolean functions for all efficiently big n.

TI High-Dimensional and Multi-Intensity One-Photon-Interference Quantum
   Secure Direct Communication
SO ENTROPY
AB As a novel paradigm in quantum communication, quantum secure direct communication (QSDC) enables secure, reliable, and deterministic information transmission, leveraging the principles of quantum mechanics. One-photon-interference QSDC is particularly attractive because it mitigates the vulnerabilities in measurement devices while extending transmission distances. In this paper, we propose a high-dimensional one-photon-interference QSDC protocol that exploits the advantages of high-dimensional encoding in the phase of weak coherent pluses to further enhance transmission distances and improve secrecy channel capacity. The security of this protocol is analyzed using quantum wiretap channel theory, and its resistance to common quantum threats is discussed. Numerical simulations demonstrate that our protocol outperforms its predecessor in terms of its secrecy capacity and extends the maximum communication distance achievable up to 494 km, which is over 13% longer than the two-dimensional case, effectively doubling the transmission length of traditional protocols. These improvements highlight the protocol's potential for use in quantum communication applications in this era of frequent data breaches and information leaks.

TI Effects of chromatic dispersion on single-photon temporal wave functions
   in quantum communications
SO QUANTUM INFORMATION PROCESSING
AB In this study, we investigate the effects of chromatic dispersion on single-photon temporal wave functions (TWFs) in the context of quantum communications. Departing from classical beam analysis, we focus on the temporal shape of single photons, specifically exploring generalized Gaussian modes. From this foundation, we introduce chirped and unchirped Gaussian TWFs, demonstrating the impact of the chirp parameter in mitigating chromatic dispersion effects. Furthermore, we extend our investigation to time-bin qubits, a topic of ongoing research relevance. By exploring the interplay of dispersion effects on qubit interference patterns, we contribute essential insights to quantum information processing. This comprehensive analysis considers various parameters, introducing a level of complexity not previously explored in the context of dispersion management. We demonstrate the relationships between different quantities and their impact on the spreading of TWFs. Our results not only deepen the theoretical understanding of single-photon TWFs but also offer practical guidelines for system designers to optimize symbol rates in quantum communications.

TI Micro-integrated crossed-beam optical dipole trap system with long-term
   alignment stability for mobile atomic quantum technologies
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB Quantum technologies extensively use laser light for state preparation, manipulation, and readout. For field applications, these systems must be robust and compact, driving the need for miniaturized and highly stable optical setups and system integration. In this work, we present a micro-integrated crossed-beam optical dipole trap setup, the mu XODT, designed for trapping and cooling 87 Rb. This fiber-coupled setup operates at 1064 nm wavelength with up to 2.5 W optical power and realizes a free-space crossed beam geometry. The mu XODT precisely overlaps two focused beams (w0 approximate to 33 mu m) at their waists in a 45 degrees crossing angle, achieving a position difference of <= 3.4 mu m and a 0.998 power ratio between both beams with long-term stability. We describe the design and assembly process in detail, along with optical and thermal tests with temperatures of up to 65 degrees C. The system's volume of 25 ml represents a reduction of more than two orders of magnitude compared to typically used macroscopic setups while demonstrating exceptional mechanical robustness and thermal stability. The mu XODT is integrated with an 87 Rb 3D MOT setup, trapping 3 x 105 atoms from a laser-cooled atomic cloud, and has shown no signs of degradation after two years of operation.

We show that by varying the magnitude and direction of the external field one can accurately control the dark-exciton fine-structure splitting. In addition, we show that the dark-exciton spin state is approximately polarized along the cubic crystallographic directions [100] or equivalents. By comparing our experimental results with a model for the exchange and Zeeman interactions, we find the conditions for nullifying the fine-structure splitting between the two eigenstates of the dark exciton, thereby stopping its qubit precession.

TI High-fidelity single-shot readout of single electron spin in diamond
   with spin-to-charge conversion
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB High fidelity single-shot readout of qubits is a crucial component for fault-tolerant quantum computing and scalable quantum networks. In recent years, the nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center in diamond has risen as a leading platform for the above applications. The current single-shot readout of the NV electron spin relies on resonance fluorescence method at cryogenic temperature. However, the spin-flip process interrupts the optical cycling transition, therefore, limits the readout fidelity. Here, we introduce a spin-to-charge conversion method assisted by near-infrared (NIR) light to suppress the spin-flip error. This method leverages high spin-selectivity of cryogenic resonance excitation and flexibility of photoionization. We achieve an overall fidelity>95% for the single-shot readout of an NV center electron spin in the presence of high strain and fast spin-flip process. With further improvements, this technique has the potential to achieve spin readout fidelity exceeding the fault-tolerant threshold, and may also find applications on integrated optoelectronic devices. The NV centre in diamond has been used extensively in quantum information processing; however fault-tolerant readout of its spin remains challenging. Here, Zhang et al demonstrate a robust scheme that achieves high-fidelity readout via spin to charge conversion.

TI Engineering high Pockels coefficients in thin-film strontium titanate
   for cryogenic quantum electro-optic applications
SO SCIENCE
AB Pockels materials are notable for their strong electro-optic interaction and rapid response times and are therefore used extensively in optical communications. However, at cryogenic temperatures, Pockels coefficients are reduced in many materials optimized for room-temperature operation, which is a major hurdle for emerging quantum technologies. Here, we show that strontium titanate (SrTiO3) can be engineered to exhibit a Pockels coefficient of 345 picometers per volt at 20 hertz at cryogenic temperatures, a value twice as high as any other thin-film electro-optic material. By adjusting the stoichiometry, we were able to increase the Curie temperature and realize a ferroelectric phase yielding a high Pockels coefficient, so far with limited optical losses of decibels per centimeter. Our findings position SrTiO3 as a promising material for cryogenic quantum photonics applications.

TI The diamond NV-center transition energies in the vicinity of an
   intrinsic stacking fault
SO AIP ADVANCES
AB The negatively charged nitrogen vacancy (NV-) center in a diamond is a nanometer-sized defect with very sensitive properties that can be manipulated, for example, for single-molecule photoluminescence and nuclear magnetic resonance sensing, as a single photon source for quantum cryptography and as a qubit in room temperature quantum computing. To have a minimal perturbation of its properties, it is important to isolate the NV-center from other defects. One type of the extended defects that can be common in diamonds is the intrinsic stacking fault (ISF) associated with dislocations. In this work, we use density functional theory simulations to investigate how the distance between the NV- center and an ISF affects its properties, including the transition energies, spin density, and energy eigenvalues in the Kohn-Sham bandgap. We have found that the NV-center properties are only slightly perturbed when placed in the vicinity of an ISF. Even for an interdistance of only 3.8 & ANGS; between the NV-center and the ISF, the decrease in its zero phonon line (ZPL) energy is less than 6.8%. To more significantly perturb the ZPL, the NV-center has to be placed inside the stacking fault glide plane (11.3% decrease). The changes in ZPL are in the majority of cases lower than the bulk value, which can be used to guide experimental observations. We find that the NV-center is only weakly interacting with ISFs, which in addition to a small bulk conversion depth of 5 & ANGS; to a diamond surface is important for their technological use.& nbsp;(C) 2022 Author(s).

TI Variational-toolbox-based separability detection of multiqubit states
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Parameterized quantum circuits (PQCs) play a crucial role in variational quantum algorithms. While it is commonly believed that the optimal PQC can be used to reproduce the target state, here we reveal that the optimal PQC can also provide valuable insights into the state's properties. We propose variational toolboxes to identify the k-separability of pure states, with or without preparation noise, by checking the structure within the optimal PQCs. Additionally, we introduce adaptive optimization strategies to detect the k-separability of mixed states. Compared to fixed PQCs, our approach controls fewer parameters for low-rank states. Finally, we validate our methods through numerical demonstrations for various states.

TI Spin-qubit readout analysis based on a hidden Markov model
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
AB Across most qubit platforms, the readout fidelities do not keep up with the gate fidelities, and new ways to increase the readout fidelities are searched for. For semiconductor spin qubits, a typical qubit-readout signal consists of a finite stretch of a digitized charge-sensor output. Such a signal trace is usually analyzed by compressing it into a single value, either maximum or sum. The binary measurement result follows by comparing the single value to a decision threshold fixed in advance. This threshold method, while simple and fast, omits information that could potentially improve the readout fidelity. Here, we analyze what can be achieved by more sophisticated signal-trace processing using the hidden Markov model (HMM). The HMM is a natural choice, being the optimal statistical processing if the noise is white. It also has a computationally efficient implementation, known as the forward-backward algorithm, making HMM processing practical. However, unlike in many computer-simulation studies, in real experiments the noise is correlated. How this change affects the HMM implementation and reliability is our subject. We find that the HMM using white noise as the system statistical model is surprisingly sensitive to correlations; it only tolerates very small correlation times. We suggest alleviating this deficiency by a signal prefiltering. The correlations have a similar strongly negative impact on the HMM model calibration (the Baum-Welch algorithm). Besides studying the effects of noise correlations, as a specific application of the HMM we calculate the readout fidelity at elevated temperatures, relevant to recent experimental pursuits of hot spin qubits.

TI Optimizing Continuous-Variable Quantum Key Distribution with Phase-Shift
   Keying Modulation and Postselection
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW APPLIED
AB A numerical security proof technique is used to analyze the security of continuous-variable quantum key distribution (CV-QKD) protocols with phase-shift keying (PSK) modulation against collective attacks in the asymptotic limit. We argue that it is sufficient to consider protocols with a maximum of eight signal states and analyze different postselection strategies for protocols with four (QPSK) and eight (8PSK) signal states for untrusted ideal and trusted nonideal detectors. We introduce a cross-shaped postselection strategy, and show that both cross-shaped and radial and angular postselection clearly outperform a radial postselection scheme (and no postselection) for QPSK protocols. For all strategies studied, we provide analytical results for the operators defining the respective regions in phase space. We outline several use cases of postselection, which can easily be introduced in the data processing of both new and existing CV-QKD systems. Motivated by the high computational effort for error correction, we study the case when a large fraction of the raw key is eliminated by postselection and observe that this can be achieved while increasing the secure key rate. Postselection can also be used to partially compensate the disadvantage of QPSK protocols over 8PSK protocols for high transmission distances, while being experimentally less demanding. Finally, we highlight that postselection can be used to reduce the key rate gap between scenarios with trusted and untrusted detectors while relying on less assumptions on Eve's power.

TI Probing decoherence in molecular 4f qubits
SO CHEMICAL SCIENCE
AB We probe herein the fundamental factors that induce decoherence in ensembles of molecular magnetic materials. This is done by pulse Electron Paramagnetic Resonance measurements at X-band (similar to 9.6 GHz) on single crystals of Gd@Y(trensal) at 0.5, 10-1, 10-2 and 10-3% doping levels, using Hahn echo, partial refocusing and CPMG sequences. The phase memory time, Tm, obtained by the Hahn echo sequence at X-band is compared to the one previously determined at higher frequency/magnetic field (similar to 240 GHz). The combined information from these experiments allows to gain insight into the contributions to decoherence originating from various relaxation mechanisms such as spin-lattice relaxation, electron and nuclear spin diffusion and instantaneous diffusion. We show that while at high magnetic fields Tm is limited by spin-lattice relaxation seemingly attributed to a direct process, at lower fields the limiting factor is spectral diffusion. At X-band, for Gd@Y(trensal) we determine a Tm in the range 1-12 mu s, at 5 K, depending on the magnetic field and concentration of Gd(trensal) in the isostructural diamagnetic host Y(trensal). Importantly, Gd@Y(trensal) displays measurable coherence at temperatures above liquid nitrogen ones, with 125 K being the upper limit. At the lowest dilution level of 10-3% and under dynamic decoupling conditions, the ratio of Tmversus the time it takes to implement a quantum gate, TG, reaches the order of 104, in the example of a single qubit pi-rotation, which corresponds to an upper limit of gate fidelity of the order of 99.99%, reaching thus the lower limit of qubit figure of merit required for implementations in quantum information technologies.

TI Quantum behaved intelligent variant of gravitational search algorithm
   with deep neural networks for human activity recognition
SO KUWAIT JOURNAL OF SCIENCE
AB Human activity recognition (HAR) encompasses the detection of daily routine activities to advance us-ability in detecting crime and preventing dangerous activities. The recognition of activities from videos and image sequences with higher exactitude is a major challenge due to system complexities. The ef-ficient feature optimization approach can reduce system complexities by removing ineffective features, which also improves the activity recognition performance. This research work presents a novel quantum behaved intelligent gravitational search algorithm to optimize the features for human activity recogni-tion. The proposed intelligent variant is termed as INQGSA, which optimizes the features by using the advantageous attributes of quantum computing (QC) and intelligent gravitational search algorithm (IN -GSA). In INQGSA, the intelligent factor avoids the trapping of mass agents in later iterations by using the information of the best and worst agents to update the position of agents. The addition of quantum computing based attributes (such as quantum bits, their superposition, and quantum gates, etc.) ensures a better diversity of discrete optimized features. To analyze the superiority of INQGSA, the feature optimization is also conducted with the gravitational search algorithm (GSA) and the quantum-inspired binary gravitational search algorithm (QBGSA). Finally, the optimized selected features are utilized by the deep neural networks (DNN) of ResNet-50V2 and ResNet-101V2 for the classification of activi-ties. The activity recognition experiments are conducted on the UCF101 and HMDB51 datasets. The performance comparison of the proposed HAR system with state-of-the-art techniques signifies that the proposed system is superior and effective in detecting the different activities.

SO JOURNAL OF THE INDONESIAN MATHEMATICAL SOCIETY
AB This paper focuses on studying the properties of constacyclic codes and quantum error-correcting codes. The code is studied over a specific mathematical structure called the ringS, which is defined asS=I-q[u,v]/< u(2)-alpha(2),v(2)-alpha(2),uv-vu >, where I-q is a finite field of q elements,alpha be the nonzero elements of the field Iq, andqis a power of an odd primep such that q=pm,for m >= 1. The paper also introduces a Gray map and use it to decompose constacyclic codes over the ring Sin to a direct sum of constacyclic codes over I-q. We construct new and better quantum error-correcting codes over the ring S(cf.; Table 1 and Table 2). Moreover, we also obtain best known linear codes as well as best dimension linear codes (cf.;Table 4).

TI Correlations in Entanglement-Assisted Prepare-and-Measure Scenarios
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB We investigate the correlations that can arise between Alice and Bob in prepare-and-measure communication scenarios where the source (Alice) and the measurement device (Bob) can share prior entanglement. The paradigmatic example of such a scenario is the quantum dense-coding protocol, where the communication capacity of a qudit can be doubled if a two-qudit entangled state is shared between Alice and Bob. We provide examples of correlations that actually require more general protocols based on higher-dimensional entangled states. This motivates us to investigate the set of correlations that can be obtained from communicating either a classical or a quantum d-dimensional system in the presence of an unlimited amount of entanglement. We show how such correlations can be characterized by a hierarchy of semidefinite programming relaxations by reducing the problem to a noncommutative polynomial optimization problem. We also introduce an alternative relaxation hierarchy based on the notion of informationally restricted quantum correlations, which, though it represents a strict (nonconverging) relaxation scheme, is less computationally demanding. As an application, we introduce device-independent tests of the dimension of classical and quantum systems that, in contrast to previous results, do not make the implicit assumption that Alice and Bob share no entanglement. We also establish several relations between communication with and without entanglement as resources for creating correlations.

TI Non-Markovian dynamics of a qubit due to accelerated light in a lattice
SO PHYSICA SCRIPTA
AB We investigate the emission of a qubit weakly coupled to a one-band coupled-cavity array where, due to an engineered gradient in the cavity frequencies, photons are effectively accelerated by a synthetic force F. For strong F, a reversible emission described by an effective Jaynes-Cummings model occurs, causing a chiral time-periodic excitation of an extensive region of the array, either to the right or to left of the qubit depending on its frequency. For weak values of F instead, a complex non-Markovian decay with revivals shows up. This is reminiscent of dynamics induced by mirrors in standard waveguides, despite the absence of actual mirrors, and can be attributed to the finite width of the energy band which confine the motion of the emitted photon. In a suitable regime, the decay is well described by a delay differential equation formally analogous to the one governing the decay of an atom in a multi-mode cavity where the cavity length and time taken by a photon to travel between the two mirrors are now embodied by the amplitude and period of Bloch oscillations, respectively.

TI Unified entropies and quantum speed limits for nonunitary dynamics
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB We discuss a class of quantum speed limits (QSLs) based on unified quantum (alpha, mu)-entropy for nonunitary physical processes. The bounds depend on both the Schatten speed and the smallest eigenvalue of the evolved state and the two-parametric unified entropy. We specialize these results to quantum channels and non-Hermitian evolutions. In the first case, the QSL depends on the Kraus operators related to the quantum channel, while in the second case the speed limit is recast in terms of the non-Hermitian Hamiltonian. To illustrate these findings, we consider a single-qubit state evolving under the (i) amplitude damping channel and (ii) the nonunitary dynamics generated by a parity-time-reversal symmetric non-Hermitian Hamiltonian. The QSL is nonzero at earlier times, while it becomes loose as the smallest eigenvalue of the evolved state approaches zero. Furthermore, we investigate the interplay between unified entropies and speed limits for the reduced dynamics of quantum many-body systems. The unified entropy is upper bounded by the quantum fluctuations of the Hamiltonian of the system, while the QSL is nonzero when entanglement is created by the nonunitary evolution. Finally, we apply these results to the XXZ model and verify that the QSL asymptotically decreases as the system size increases. Our results find applications to nonequilibrium thermodynamics, quantum metrology, and equilibration of many-body systems.

AB The detection of magnons and their quantum properties, especially in antiferromagnetic (AFM) materials, is a substantial step to realize many ambitious advances in the study of nanomagnetism and the development of energy efficient quantum technologies. The recent development of hybrid systems based on superconducting circuits provides the possibility to engineer quantum sensors that exploit different degrees of freedom. Here, we examine the magnon-photon-transmon hybridization based on bipartite AFM materials, which gives rise to an effective coupling between a transmon qubit and magnons in a bipartite AFM. We demonstrate how magnon modes, their chiralities, and quantum properties, such as nonlocality and two-mode magnon entanglement in bipartite AFMs, can be characterized through the Rabi frequency of the superconducting transmon qubit.

TI Quantum Neural Network for Quantum Neural Computing
SO RESEARCH
AB Neural networks have achieved impressive breakthroughs in both industry and academia. How to effectively develop neural networks on quantum computing devices is a challenging open problem. Here, we propose a new quantum neural network model for quantum neural computing using (classically controlled) single-qubit operations and measurements on real-world quantum systems with naturally occurring environment-induced decoherence, which greatly reduces the difficulties of physical implementations. Our model circumvents the problem that the state-space size grows exponentially with the number of neurons, thereby greatly reducing memory requirements and allowing for fast optimization with traditional optimization algorithms. We benchmark our model for handwritten digit recognition and other nonlinear classification tasks. The results show that our model has an amazing nonlinear classification ability and robustness to noise. Furthermore, our model allows quantum computing to be applied in a wider context and inspires the earlier development of a quantum neural computer than standard quantum computers.

TI Fully guided and phase locked Ti:PPLN waveguide squeezing for
   applications in quantum sensing
SO OPTICS LETTERS
AB This work reports a fully guided setup for single-mode squeezing on integrated titanium-indiffused periodically poled nonlinear resonators. A continuous-wave laser beam is delivered and the squeezed field is collected by single-mode fibers; up to -3.17(9) dB of useful squeezing is available in fibers. To showcase the usefulness of such a fiber-coupled device, we applied the generated squeezed light in a fiber-based phase sensing experiment, showing a quantum enhancement in the signal-to-noise ratio of 0.35 dB. Moreover, our investigation of the effect of photorefraction on the cavity resonance condition suggests that it causes system instabilities at high powers. (c) 2023 Optica Publishing Group

TI Generalized Zurek's bound on the cost of an individual classical or
   quantum computation
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW E
AB We consider the minimal thermodynamic cost of an individual computation, where a single input x is mapped to a single output y. In prior work, Zurek proposed that this cost was given by K(x|y), the conditional Kolmogorov complexity of x given y (up to an additive constant that does not depend on x or y). However, this result was derived from an informal argument, applied only to deterministic computations, and had an arbitrary dependence on the choice of protocol (via the additive constant). Here we use stochastic thermodynamics to derive a generalized version of Zurek's bound from a rigorous Hamiltonian formulation. Our bound applies to all quantum and classical processes, whether noisy or deterministic, and it explicitly captures the dependence on the protocol. We show that K(x|y) is a minimal cost of mapping x toy that must be paid using some combination of heat, noise, and protocol complexity, implying a trade-off between these three resources. Our result is a kind of "algorithmic fluctuation theorem" with implications for the relationship between the second law and the Physical Church-Turing thesis.

TI A Digital Grid Security Architecture Based on Quantum Key Interaction
   and Web Engineering for Distributed Energy Systems
SO JOURNAL OF WEB ENGINEERING
AB The modernization of distributed energy systems introduces complex cybersecurity challenges as grid infrastructures become increasingly digitized, decentralized, and web-connected. This paper presents a novel security architecture that integrates quantum key distribution (QKD) with semantic web technologies to provide end-to-end secure, scalable, and adaptive protection for distributed energy resource (DER) networks. The proposed framework features a modular system design, incorporating BB84-based QKD protocols for quantum-resilient key generation, a metadata-driven policy layer using OWL ontologies and SWRL reasoning, and a web interface for operator access and real-time monitoring. Extensive performance evaluation in a simulated multi-domain microgrid environment demonstrates that the system achieves an average key generation rate of 2.3 kbps with quantum bit error rate (QBER) maintained below 5.2% across 40 km optical links. Session establishment latency averaged 435 ms, 29.8% lower than a traditional TLS/PKI baseline, while semantic access validation achieved 100% accuracy in 42 adversarial test cases. These cases were evaluated using automated semantic validation scripts simulating spoofed roles, malformed sessions, and unauthorized requests. The system sustained encrypted throughput of 110 messages per second per node and maintained service continuity under quantum noise and cross-domain attack simulations. Usability trials with six engineers yielded a system usability scale (SUS) score of 88.3, and the average DER onboarding time was reduced from 10.1 to 5.5 minutes. These findings affirm that QKD-enhanced, semantically governed web architectures can provide strong cryptographic guarantees while supporting dynamic policy enforcement and intuitive user workflows. The proposed solution demonstrates a viable path for deploying future-proof security mechanisms in next-generation smart grid environments.

TI Nanoscale localization of the near-surface nitrogen vacancy center
   assisted by a silicon atomic force microscopy probe
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICS-PHOTONICS
AB The nitrogen vacancy (NV) center in diamond has wide applications in sensing, imaging and quantum information processing. One of the bases of these applications is to localize the NV center in diamond with high precision. In this work we demonstrate a method for nanoscale imaging and locating near-surface NV centers on diamond waveguides based on an atomic force microscopy (AFM) combined confocal system. The resulted lateral resolution for imaging the NV center is 31.6 nm and the precision of locating the NV center in diamond is 0.7 nm. Finally, the position of the NV center is indicated in AFM images of the diamond waveguide. These results provide a useful characterization tool for optimizing the diamond nanostructure for quantum information processing and quantum sensing.

TI Geometry and entanglement in the scattering matrix
SO ANNALS OF PHYSICS
AB A formulation of nucleon-nucleon scattering is developed in which the S-matrix, rather than an effective-field theory (EFT) action, is the fundamental object. Spacetime plays no role in this description: the S-matrix is a trajectory that moves between RG fixed points in a compact theory space defined by unitarity. This theory space has a natural operator definition, and a geometric embedding of the unitarity constraints in four-dimensional Euclidean space yields a flat torus, which serves as the stage on which the S-matrix propagates. Trajectories with vanishing entanglement are special geodesics between RG fixed points on the flat torus, while entanglement is driven by an external potential. The system of equations describing S-matrix trajectories is in general complicated, however the very-low-energy S-matrix -that appears at leading-order in the EFT description- possesses a UV/IR conformal invariance which renders the system of equations integrable, and completely determines the potential. In this geometric viewpoint, inelasticity is in correspondence with the radius of a three-dimensional hyperbolic space whose two-dimensional boundary is the flat torus. This space has a singularity at vanishing radius, corresponding to maximal violation of unitarity. The trajectory on the flat torus boundary can be explicitly constructed from a bulk trajectory with a quantifiable error, providing a simple example of a holographic quantum error correcting code.

TI Industry 4.0 Quantum Strategic Organizational Design Configurations. The
   Case of 3 Qubits: Two Report to One
SO ENTROPY
AB The goal of this work is to explore how the relationship between two subordinates reporting to a leader influences the alignment of the latter with the company's strategic objectives in an Industry 4.0 environment. We do this through the implementation of quantum circuits that represent decision networks. In fact, through the quantum simulation of strategic organizational design configurations (QSOD) through five hundred quantum circuit simulations. We conclude that the alignment probability of the leader is never higher than the average alignment value of his subordinates, i.e., the leader never has a better alignment than his subordinates. In other words, the leader cannot present asymptotic stability better than that of his subordinates. The most relevant conclusion of this work is the clear recommendation to the leaders of Industry 4.0 not to add hierarchical levels to their organization if they have not achieved high levels of stability in the lower levels.

TI A Review of the Current State of Magnetic Force Microscopy to Unravel
   the Magnetic Properties of Nanomaterials Applied in Biological Systems
   and Future Directions for Quantum Technologies
SO NANOMATERIALS
AB Magnetism plays a pivotal role in many biological systems. However, the intensity of the magnetic forces exerted between magnetic bodies is usually low, which demands the development of ultra-sensitivity tools for proper sensing. In this framework, magnetic force microscopy (MFM) offers excellent lateral resolution and the possibility of conducting single-molecule studies like other single-probe microscopy (SPM) techniques. This comprehensive review attempts to describe the paramount importance of magnetic forces for biological applications by highlighting MFM's main advantages but also intrinsic limitations. While the working principles are described in depth, the article also focuses on novel micro- and nanofabrication procedures for MFM tips, which enhance the magnetic response signal of tested biomaterials compared to commercial nanoprobes. This work also depicts some relevant examples where MFM can quantitatively assess the magnetic performance of nanomaterials involved in biological systems, including magnetotactic bacteria, cryptochrome flavoproteins, and magnetic nanoparticles that can interact with animal tissues. Additionally, the most promising perspectives in this field are highlighted to make the reader aware of upcoming challenges when aiming toward quantum technologies.

TI Low-Overhead Magic State Distillation with Color Codes
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB Fault-tolerant implementation of non-Clifford gates is a major challenge for achieving universal faulttolerant quantum computing with quantum error-correcting codes. Magic state distillation is the most well-studied method for this but requires significant resources. Hence, it is crucial to tailor and optimize magic state distillation for specific codes from both logical- and physical-level perspectives. In this work, we perform such optimization for two-dimensional color codes, which are promising due to their higher encoding rates compared to surface codes, transversal implementation of Clifford gates, and efficient lattice surgery. We propose two carefully designed distillation schemes based on the 15-to-1 distillation circuit and lattice surgery, differing in their methods for handling faulty rotations. Our first scheme employs faulty T measurement, achieving infidelities of O(p3) for physical noise strength p. To achieve lower infidelities, our second scheme integrates distillation with "cultivation" (a distillationfree approach to fault tolerantly prepare magic states through transversal Clifford measurements). Our second scheme achieves significantly lower infidelities (e.g., approximately 2 x 10-16 at p = 10-3), surpassing the capabilities of both cultivation and single-level distillation. Notably, to reach a given target infidelity, our schemes require approximately 2 orders of magnitude fewer resources than the previous best magic-state-distillation schemes for color codes.

TI Towards experimental demonstration of quantum position verification
   using single photons
SO QUANTUM SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB The geographical position can be a good credential for authentication of a party. This is the basis of position-based cryptography-but classically this cannot be done securely without physical exchange of a private key. Recently it has been shown that by combining quantum mechanics with the speed-of-light limit of special relativity, this might be possible: quantum position verification (QPV). Here we demonstrate experimentally a protocol that uses two-photon Hong-Ou-Mandel interference at a beamsplitter, which, in combination with two additional beam splitters and four detectors is rendering the protocol resilient to loss. With this, we are able to show first results towards an experimental demonstration of QPV.

AB We investigate the space complexity of two graph streaming problems: MAX-CUT and its quantum analogue, QUANTUM MAX-CUT. Previous work by Kapralov and Krachun [STOC '19] resolved the classical complexity of the classical problem, showing that any (2 - epsilon)-approximation requires Omega(n) space (a 2-approximation is trivial with O(log n) space). We generalize both of these qualifiers, demonstrating Omega(n) space lower bounds for (2-epsilon)-approximatingMAX-CUT and QUANTUM MAX-CUT, even if the algorithm is allowed to maintain a quantum state. As the trivial approximation algorithm for QUANTUM MAX-CUT only gives a 4-approximation, we show tightness with an algorithm that returns a (2 + epsilon)-approximation to the QUANTUM MAX-CUT value of a graph in O(log n) space. Our work resolves the quantum and classical approximability of quantum and classical Max-Cut using o(n) space. We prove our lower bounds through the techniques of Boolean Fourier analysis. We give the first application of these methods to sequential one-way quantum communication, in which each player receives a quantum message from the previous player, and can then perform arbitrary quantum operations on it before sending it to the next. To this end, we show how Fourier-analytic techniques may be used to understand the application of a quantum channel.

TI Creation of Optical Cat and GKP States Using Shaped Free Electrons
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW X
AB Cat states and Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill (GKP) states play a key role in quantum computation and communication with continuous variables. The creation of such states relies on strong nonlinear light-matter interactions, which are widely available in microwave frequencies as in circuit quantum electrodynamics platforms. However, strong nonlinearities are hard to come by in optical frequencies, severely limiting the development and applications of quantum-information science with continuous variable in the optical range. Here we propose using the strong interaction of free electrons with light to implement the desired nonlinear mechanism, showing its implication by creating optical cat and GKP states. The key to our finding is identifying conditions on the electron for which its interaction mimics the conditional displacement quantum gate. The strong interactions can be realized by phase matching of free electrons with photonic structures such as optical waveguides and photonic crystals in an ultrafast transmission electron microscope (UTEM). Our approach enables the generation of optical GKP states with above 10 dB squeezing and fidelities above 90% at postselection probability of 10%, even reaching > 30% using an initially squeezed-vacuum state. We analyze the different factors that affect the fidelity, such as electron dispersion, inhomogeneity, nonideal interaction, and limited detection efficiency. Furthermore, the free-electron interaction allows two qubit gates between a pair of GKP states, which can entangle them into a GKP Bell state. We present a roadmap for realizing such experiments in a UTEM. Since electrons can interact resonantly with light across the electromagnetic spectrum, our approach could apply for a generation of cat and GKP states also in other platforms of free electron radiation, from klystrons to free-electron lasers.

TI Quantum Simulation of Antiferromagnetic Heisenberg Chain with
   Gate-Defined Quantum Dots
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW X
AB Quantum-mechanical correlations of interacting fermions result in the emergence of exotic phases. Magnetic phases naturally arise in the Mott-insulator regime of the Fermi-Hubbard model, where charges are localized and the spin degree of freedom remains. In this regime, the occurrence of phenomena such as resonating valence bonds, frustrated magnetism, and spin liquids is predicted. Quantum systems with engineered Hamiltonians can be used as simulators of such spin physics to provide insights beyond the capabilities of analytical methods and classical computers. To be useful, methods for the preparation of intricate many-body spin states and access to relevant observables are required. Here, we show the quantum simulation of magnetism in the Mott-insulator regime with a linear quantum-dot array. We characterize the energy spectrum for a Heisenberg spin chain, from which we can identify when the conditions for homogeneous exchange couplings are met. Next, we study the multispin coherence with global exchange oscillations in both the singlet and triplet subspace of the Heisenberg Hamiltonian. Last, we adiabatically prepare the low-energy global singlet of the homogeneous spin chain and probe it with two-spin singlet triplet measurements on each nearest-neighbor pair and the correlations therein. The methods and control presented here open new opportunities for the simulation of quantum magnetism benefiting from the flexibility in tuning and layout of gate-defined quantum-dot arrays.

In particular, electrical driving allows us to apply localized fields on the electrons, which benefits scale-up architectures. However, we have found that Electric Dipole Spin Resonance is insufficient for modeling the Rabi behavior in recent experimental studies. Therefore, we propose that the electron spin is being driven by a method of electric spin qubit control that generalizes the spin dynamics by taking into account a quadrupolar contribution of the quantum dot: electric quadrupole spin resonance. In this work, we explore the electric quadrupole driving of a quantum dot in silicon, specifically examining the cases of 5 and 13 electron occupancies.

TI Photon number-resolving quantum reservoir computing
SO OPTICA QUANTUM
AB Neuromorphic processors improve the efficiency of machine learning algorithms through the implementation of physical artificial neurons to perform computations. However, while efficient classical neuromorphic processors have been demonstrated in various forms, practical quantum neuromorphic platforms are still in the early stages of development. Here we propose a fixed, random optical network for photonic quantum machine learning in the specific form of a reservoir computer that is enabled by photon number-resolved detection of the output states. This provides access to a combinatorially scaling Hilbert space, while using significantly simpler quantum states than comparable quantum machine learning approaches. The approach is implementable with currently available technology and lowers the entry barrier for quantum machine learning.

TI Quantum information scrambling and quantum chaos in little string theory
SO JOURNAL OF HIGH ENERGY PHYSICS
AB In the current manuscript we perform a systematic investigation about the effects of nonlocal interaction to the spread of quantum information in many body system. In particular, we have studied how nonlocality influence the existing bound on the growth rate of the commutator involving two local operators, the butterfly velocity. For this purpose, we consider the nonlocal theory on the worldvolume of N >> 1, NS5 branes arising in the limit of vanishing string coupling, the 'little string theory'. A direct evidence of nonlocality can be realized from the 'volume law' behavior for the most dominant part of holographic entanglement entropy. We obtain the butterfly velocity by studying the dynamics of the near horizon geometry backreacted by a high energy quanta in the form of a shockwave resulting from an early perturbation on the corresponding thermofield double state. We observe that the butterfly velocity increases with the nonlocal scale of little string theory, the inverse Hagedorn temperature beta(h), indicating a faster rate of information spread due to the nonlocal interaction. The same conclusion follows as the disruption of two sided mutual information is observed to occur at a faster rate for higher values of beta(h). Finally, we realize a direct connection between the parameters of quantum chaos and the quasinormal modes for collective excitations through the phenomenon of 'pole skipping'.

TI Dissipation-Induced Photon Blockade in the Anti-Jaynes-Cummings Model
SO PHOTONICS
AB Due to the fundamental differences between the quantum world and the classical world, some phenomena, such as entanglement and wave-particle duality, only exist in the quantum realm. These peculiar phenomena cannot be demonstrated by classical means: Quantum networks, quantum cryptography, and quantum precision measurements all require quantum sources. Photons are particularly well-suited as quantum sources owing to their minimal interaction with the environment, high flight speed, and ease of interaction with current typical quantum systems. Single-photon sources include pulsed excitation of quantum dots, spontaneous parametric down-conversion, and photon blockade. Herein, we propose that the anti-Jaynes-Cummings model can induce a pronounced photon antibunching effect when subjected to intense cavity dissipation. Similar to the photon blockade caused by strong photon-photon interaction, this antibunching effect is referred to as 'dissipation-induced blockade'. Our findings indicate that the minimum decay rate of a qubit, coupled with a high decay rate for photons, is conducive to achieving strong antibunching within the system. Notably, g(2)(0)<g(2)(tau), a characteristic of photon antibunching, is only valid under the optimal condition Delta=0. Conversely, g(2)(0)<1 is satisfied across all parameters, indicating that g(2)(0)<1 is not a prerequisite for antibunching in the anti-Jaynes-Cummings model. Moreover, under the optimal conditions of the antibunching effect, the average photon number attains its peak value. Consequently, the current anti-Jaynes-Cummings model is promising for developing single-photon sources characterized by excellent purity and average photon number.

TI Routing Protocol for Quantum Multicast Networks Based on Hyperentangled
   Relays
SO LASER & OPTOELECTRONICS PROGRESS
AB In this study, a multicast routing protocol for hyperentangled relay quantum networks is proposed to solve the problem of path selection, the establishment of multicast communication in quantum networks, and improve the communication performance of quantum multicast networks. The networks use a diamond structure to ensure the fidelity of quantum clones in multicast communication. The single-photon polarization-space mode quantum state was cloned using a quantum cloning machine, and an optimization algorithm based on the Steiner tree was used to generate a multicast tree by considering the number of hyperentanglement resources, hops, and fidelity of the cloned state. A multicast quantum channel between remote users was established based on simultaneous hyperentanglement swapping after selecting the routing. Theoretical analysis and simulation results show that in multicast communication of an increase in destination nodes, the routing protocol based on a hyperentangled relay can obtain a multicast tree with high fidelity. When the number of relay nodes increases, the delay in establishing a quantum channel using simultaneous hyperentangled swapping is lower than that of traditional sequential entangled swapping, and the transmission rate of a quantum state is faster. Therefore, the routing protocol of quantum multicast networks based on hyperentangled relays has the advantages of high fidelity and low-multicast communication delay.

TI Variational quantum and quantum-inspired clustering
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB Here we present a quantum algorithm for clustering data based on a variational quantum circuit. The algorithm allows to classify data into many clusters, and can easily be implemented in few-qubit Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum devices. The idea of the algorithm relies on reducing the clustering problem to an optimization, and then solving it via a Variational Quantum Eigensolver combined with non-orthogonal qubit states. In practice, the method uses maximally-orthogonal states of the target Hilbert space instead of the usual computational basis, allowing for a large number of clusters to be considered even with few qubits. We benchmark the algorithm with numerical simulations using real datasets, showing excellent performance even with one single qubit. Moreover, a tensor network simulation of the algorithm implements, by construction, a quantum-inspired clustering algorithm that can run on current classical hardware.

TI Quantum collision circuit, quantum invariants and quantum phase
   estimation procedure for fluid dynamic lattice gas automata
SO COMPUTERS & FLUIDS
AB Lattice Gas Cellular Automata (LGCA) is a classical numerical method widely known and applied to simulate several physical phenomena. In this paper, we study the translation of LGCA on quantum computers (QC) using computational basis encoding (CBE), developing methods for different purposes. In particular, we clarify and discuss some fundamental limitations and advantages in using CBE and quantum walk as streaming procedure. Using quantum walks affect the possible encoding of classical states in quantum orthogonal states, feature linked to the unitarity of collision and to the possibility of getting a quantum advantage. Then, we give efficient procedures for optimizing collisional quantum circuits, based on the classical features of the model. This is applied specifically to fluid dynamic LGCA. Alongside, a new collision circuit for a 1-dimensional model is proposed. We address the important point of invariants in LGCA providing a method for finding how many invariants appear in their QC formulation. Quantum invariants outnumber the classical expectations, proving the necessity of further research. Lastly, we prove the validity of a method for retrieving any quantity of interest based on quantum phase estimation (QPE).

TI Thickness dependence of the mechanical properties of piezoelectric
   high-Qm nanomechanical resonators made from aluminium
   nitride
SO MATERIALS FOR QUANTUM TECHNOLOGY
AB Nanomechanical resonators with high quality factors (Qm) enable mechanics-based quantum technologies, in particular quantum sensing and quantum transduction. High-Qm nanomechanical resonators in the kHz to MHz frequency range can be realized in tensile-strained thin films that allow the use of dissipation dilution techniques to drastically increase Qm. In our work, we study the material properties of tensile-strained piezoelectric films made from aluminium nitride (AlN). We characterize crystalline AlN films with a thickness ranging from 45 nm to 295 nm, which are directly grown on Si(111) by metal-organic vapour-phase epitaxy. We report on the crystal quality and surface roughness, the piezoelectric response, and the residual and released stress of the AlN thin films. Importantly, we determine the intrinsic quality factor of the films at room temperature in high vacuum. We fabricate and characterize AlN nanomechanical resonators that exploit dissipation dilution to enhance the intrinsic quality factor by utilizing the tensile strain in the film. We find that AlN nanomechanical resonators below 200 nm thickness exhibit the highest Qmxfm-product, on the order of 1012 Hz. We discuss possible strategies to optimize the material growth that should lead to devices that reach even higher Qmxfm-products. This will pave the way for future advancements of optoelectromechanical quantum devices made from tensile-strained piezoelectric AlN.

TI Protecting the Quantum Interference of Cat States by Phase-Space
   Compression
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW X
AB Cat states, with their unique phase-space interference properties, are ideal candidates for understanding fundamental principles of quantum mechanics and performing key quantum information processing tasks. However, they are highly susceptible to photon loss, which inevitably diminishes their quantum nonGaussian features. Here, we protect these non-Gaussian features against photon loss by compressing the phase-space distribution of a cat state. We achieve this compression with a deterministic technique based on the echoed conditional displacement operation in a circuit QED device. We present a versatile technique for creating robust non-Gaussian continuous-variable resource states in a highly linear bosonic mode and manipulating their phase-space distribution to achieve enhanced resilience against photon loss. Such compressed cat states offer an attractive avenue for obtaining new insights into quantum foundations and quantum metrology, as well as for developing inherently more protected bosonic code words for quantum error correction.

TI Excited-state downfolding using ground-state formalisms
SO ELECTRONIC STRUCTURE
AB Downfolding coupled cluster (CC) techniques are powerful tools for reducing the dimensionality of many-body quantum problems. This work investigates how ground-state downfolding formalisms can target excited states using non-Aufbau reference determinants, paving the way for applications of quantum computing in excited-state chemistry. This study focuses on doubly excited states for which canonical equation-of-motion CC approaches struggle to describe unless one includes higher-than-double excitations. The downfolding technique results in state-specific effective Hamiltonians that, when diagonalized in their respective active spaces, provide ground- and excited-state total energies (and therefore excitation energies) comparable to high-level CC methods. The performance of this procedure is examined with doubly excited states of H2, Methylene, Formaldehyde, and Nitroxyl.

SO SCIENCE BULLETIN
AB We develop a new spectroscopic method to quickly and intuitively characterize the coupling of two microwave-photon-coupled semiconductor qubits via a high-impedance resonator. Highly distinctive and unique geometric patterns are revealed as we tune the qubit tunnel couplings relative to the frequency of the mediating photons. These patterns are in excellent agreement with a simulation using the Tavis-Cummings model, and allow us to readily identify different parameter regimes for both qubits in the detuning space. This method could potentially be an important component in the overall spectroscopic toolbox for quickly characterizing certain collective properties of multiple cavity quantum electrodynamics (QED) coupled qubits.

AB Along with the development of AI democratization, the machine learning approach, in particular neural networks, has been applied to wide-range applications. In different application scenarios, the neural network will be accelerated on the tailored computing platform. The acceleration of neural networks on classical computing platforms, such as CPU, GPU, FPGA, ASIC, has been widely studied; however, when the scale of the application consistently grows up, the memory bottleneck becomes obvious, widely known as memory-wall. In response to such a challenge, advanced quantum computing, which can represent 2(N) states with N quantum bits (qubits), is regarded as a promising solution. It is imminent to know how to design the quantum circuit for accelerating neural networks. Most recently, there are initial works studying how to map neural networks to actual quantum processors. To better understand the state-of-the-art design and inspire new design methodology, this paper carries out a case study to demonstrate an end-to-end implementation. On the neural network side, we employ the multilayer perceptron to complete image classification tasks using the standard and widely used MNIST dataset. On the quantum computing side, we target IBM Quantum processors, which can be programmed and simulated by using IBM Qiskit. This work targets the acceleration of the inference phase of a trained neural network on the quantum processor. Along with the case study, we will demonstrate the typical procedure for mapping neural networks to quantum circuits.

TI Generative quantum combinatorial optimization by means of a novel
   conditional generative quantum eigensolver
SO DIGITAL DISCOVERY
AB Quantum computing is entering a transformative phase with the emergence of logical quantum processors, which hold the potential to tackle complex problems beyond classical capabilities. While significant progress has been made, applying quantum algorithms to real-world problems remains challenging. Hybrid quantum-classical techniques have been explored to bridge this gap, but they often face limitations in expressiveness, trainability, or scalability. In this work, we introduce conditional Generative Quantum Eigensolver (conditional-GQE), a context-aware quantum circuit generator powered by an encoder-decoder transformer. Focusing on combinatorial optimization, we train our generator for solving problems with up to 10 qubits, exhibiting nearly perfect performance on new problems. By leveraging the high expressiveness and flexibility of classical generative models, along with an efficient preference-based training scheme, conditional-GQE provides a generalizable and scalable framework for quantum circuit generation. Our approach advances hybrid quantum-classical computing and contributes to accelerate the transition toward fault-tolerant quantum computing.

TI Saturation and Recurrence of Quantum Complexity in Random Local Quantum
   Dynamics
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW X
AB Quantum complexity is a measure of the minimal number of elementary operations required to approximately prepare a given state or unitary channel. Recently, this concept has found applications beyond quantum computing-in studying the dynamics of quantum many-body systems and the long-time properties of anti-de Sitter black holes. In this context, Brown and Susskind [Phys. Rev. D 97, 086015 (2018)] conjectured that the complexity of a chaotic quantum system grows linearly in time up to times exponential in the system size, saturating at a maximal value, and remaining maximally complex until undergoing recurrences at doubly exponential times. In this work, we prove the saturation and recurrence of complexity in two models of chaotic time evolutions based on (i) random local quantum circuits and (ii) stochastic local Hamiltonian evolution. Our results advance an understanding of the long-time behavior of chaotic quantum systems and could shed light on the physics of black-hole interiors. From a technical perspective, our results are based on establishing new quantitative connections between the Haar measure and high-degree approximate designs, as well as the fact that random quantum circuits of sufficiently high depth converge to approximate designs.

TI Pseudo twirling mitigation of coherent errors in non-Clifford gates
SO NPJ QUANTUM INFORMATION
AB The conventional circuit paradigm, utilizing a small set of gates to construct arbitrary quantum circuits, is hindered by significant noise. In the quantum Fourier transform, for instance, the standard gate paradigm employs two CNOT gates for the partial CPhase. In contrast, some quantum computers can directly implement such operations using their native interaction, resulting in less noisy gates. Unfortunately, coherent errors degrade the performance of these gates. In Clifford gates such as the CNOT, these errors can be addressed through randomized compiling (RC). However, RC does not apply to the non-Clifford multi-qubit native implementations described above. The present work introduces and experimentally demonstrates a technique called 'Pseudo Twirling' (PST) to address coherent errors. We demonstrate experimentally that integrating PST with the 'Adaptive KIK' quantum error mitigation method enables the simultaneous mitigation of noise and coherent errors in multi-qubit non-Clifford gates.

TI Analysis of many-body localization transitions in Floquet systems:

SO PHYSICA B-CONDENSED MATTER
AB We investigate many-body localization (MBL) phase transitions in Floquet-driven quantum systems, employing global quantum discord (GQD) to compare the stability and dynamics of MBL phases under random and quasi-periodic disorder. For a static Heisenberg spin-1/2 ladder, GQD reveals critical disorder strengths of W-c approximate to 9.5 (random case) and W-c approximate to 8.5 (quasi-periodic case), highlighting the greater stability of quasi-periodic disorder. In Floquet systems, high-frequency drives (omega > 20) suppress energy absorption, preserving MBL even in weakly disordered ergodic regimes, while low frequencies (omega< 2) or strong amplitudes promote thermalization. Quasi-periodic disorder exhibits superior resistance to thermalization, with higher critical driving amplitudes, attributed to robust internal correlations quantified by GQD. Variance analysis confirms the consistency of these critical points. Our findings clarify the distinct stabilization mechanisms of driving parameters in Floquet-MBL systems, while demonstrating quasi-periodic disorder's inherent robustness against perturbations, offering guidance for the experimental realization of nonergodic quantum states.

TI Solid-State Single-Photon Sources: Recent Advances for Novel Quantum
   Materials
SO ADVANCED FUNCTIONAL MATERIALS
AB In this review, the current landscape of emergent quantum materials for quantum photonic applications is described. The review focuses on three specific solid-state platforms: single emitters in monolayers of transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs), defects in hexagonal boron nitride (hBN), and colloidal quantum dots in perovskites (PQDs). These platforms share a unique technological accessibility, enabling the rapid implementation of testbed quantum applications, all while being on the verge of becoming technologically mature enough for a first generation of real-world quantum applications. The review begins with a comprehensive overview of the current state-of-the-art for relevant single-photon sources in the solid-state, introducing the most important performance criteria and experimental characterization techniques along the way. Progress for each of the three novel materials is then benchmarked against more established (yet complex) platforms, highlighting performance, material-specific advantages, and giving an outlook on quantum applications. This review will thus provide the reader with a snapshot on latest developments in the fast-paced field of emergent single-photon sources in the solid-state, including all the required concepts and experiments relevant to this technology.
   This review explores the frontier of quantum materials for photonics, highlighting three innovative solid-state platforms: quantum dots in perovskites, transition metal dichalcogenide monolayers, and hexagonal boron nitride defects.

TI State-Of-The-Art On Reversible Multiplier Architectures and Its
   Comparison for Future Quantum Computing
SO GAZI UNIVERSITY JOURNAL OF SCIENCE
AB Multiplication is the key crucial operation in realizing digital signal processing (DSP) functions. It is accomplished by using diverse multiplier architectures. Multiplication operation is furthermost basic and normally used action in the central processing unit (CPU). The multiplication operation is the most fundamental and commonly performed activity in the central processing unit (CPU). An efficient multiplier design should have a high speed, small area, and a low power consumption. Compact, efficient multipliers with minimal power dissipation are needed. The proposed paper provides a thorough inspection of multipliers such as the Array multiplier, Booth multiplier, column bypass multiplier, Baugh-Wooley multiplier, and Vedic multiplier based on their operational activities and working, as well as their benefits and limits. A comparison of these multipliers' performance parameters such as speed, area, power consumption, quantum cost, garbage generation and circuit complexity.

TI Topological Properties of Four-qubit Entangled Phases on the Breathing
   Pyrochlore Lattice
SO JOURNAL OF THE PHYSICAL SOCIETY OF JAPAN
AB We show that the octupolar paramagnetic (OPM) phase and the four-qubit W phase that emerged in the XXZ model on a breathing pyrochlore lattice are gapped and characterized by topological order parameters. Utilizing the fact that those two phases are adjacent to the XY ferromagnetic phase characterized by the in-plane ferromagnetic order, we obtain the phase diagram based on the scaling analysis of the spin stiffness using quantum Monte Carlo calculations with systems having up to 32,000 spins. We also demonstrate that those phases are characterized by the Z4 Berry phase, and the OPM phase is further characterized by the Z6 Berry phase. We also examine the surface, edge, and corner states and then find that specific regimes of these phases can be considered higher-order topological phases.

TI Tangible reduction in learning sample complexity with large classical
   samples and small quantum system
SO QUANTUM INFORMATION PROCESSING
AB Quantum computation requires large classical datasets to be embedded into quantum states in order to exploit quantum parallelism. However, this embedding requires considerable resources in general. It would therefore be desirable to avoid it, if possible, for noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) implementation. Accordingly, we consider a classical-quantum hybrid architecture, which allows large classical input data, with a relatively small-scale quantum system. This hybrid architecture is used to implement a sampling oracle. It is shown that in the presence of noise in the hybrid oracle, the effects of internal noise can cancel each other out and thereby improve the query success rate. It is also shown that such an immunity of the hybrid oracle to noise directly and tangibly reduces the sample complexity in the framework of computational learning theory. This NISQ-compatible learning advantage is attributed to the oracle's ability to handle large input features.

TI Fast Simulation of Bosonic Qubits via Gaussian Functions in Phase Space
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB Bosonic qubits are a promising route to building fault-tolerant quantum computers on a variety of physical platforms. Studying the performance of bosonic qubits under realistic gates and measurements is challenging with existing analytical and numerical tools. We present a novel formalism for simulating classes of states that can be represented as linear combinations of Gaussian functions in phase space. This formalism allows us to analyze and simulate a wide class of non-Gaussian states, transformations, and measurements. We demonstrate how useful classes of bosonic qubits-Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill (GKP), cat, and Fock states-can be simulated using this formalism, opening the door to investigating the behavior of bosonic qubits under Gaussian channels and measurements, non-Gaussian transformations such as those achieved via gate teleportation, and important non-Gaussian measurements such as threshold and photon-number detection. Our formalism enables simulating these situations with levels of accuracy that are not feasible with existing methods. Finally, we use a method informed by our formalism to simulate circuits critical to the study of fault-tolerant quantum computing with bosonic qubits but beyond the reach of existing techniques. Specifically, we examine how finite-energy GKP states transform under realistic qubit phase gates; interface with a continuous-variable cluster state; and transform under non-Clifford T gate teleportation using magic states. We implement our simulation method as a part of the open-source Strawberry Fields PYTHON library.

TI Accelerating optimization of composite material formulations having best
   property through AI models and quasi-quantum computing methods
SO MRS ADVANCES
AB Integrating AI into materials science accelerates material discovery. This study develops an Ising model for composite material optimization using machine learning and solves it efficiently with an annealing computer. Unlike traditional methods limited to directly representable problems, our approach converts machine learning into Ising models. It includes a transformation unit to binarize variables, a training unit to learn an Ising model, and an output unit to optimize using the trained model. With an annealing computer, we achieve speeds tens of thousands of times faster than exhaustive methods. Compositional constraints are incorporated as penalty functions to ensure valid combinations. This novel method transforms machine learning predictions into Ising models, enabling rapid optimization and advancing AI applications in materials science.

TI Quantum speed limits for information and coherence
SO NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB The quantum speed limit indicates the maximal evolution speed of the quantum system. In this work, we determine speed limits on the informational measures, namely the von Neumann entropy, maximal information, and coherence of quantum systems evolving under dynamical processes. These speed limits ascertain the fundamental limitations on the evolution time required by the quantum systems for the changes in their informational measures. Erasing of quantum information to reset the memory for future use is crucial for quantum computing devices. We use the speed limit on the maximal information to obtain the minimum time required to erase the information of quantum systems via some quantum processes of interest.

TI Stable states with nonzero entropy under broken PT symmetry
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB The PT-symmetric non-Hermitian systems have been widely studied and explored both in theory and in experiment due to their various interesting features. In this work we focus on the dynamical features of a triple-qubit system, one of which evolves under a local PT-symmetric Hamiltonian. An abnormal dynamic pattern in the entropy evolution process is identified that presents a parameter-dependent stable state, determined by the non-Hermiticity of Hamiltonian in the broken phase of PT symmetry. The entanglement and mutual information of a two-body subsystem can increase beyond the initial values, which do not exist in the Hermitian and two-qubit PT-symmetric systems. Moreover, an experimental demonstration of the stable states in non-Hermitian systems with nonzero entropy and entanglement is realized on a four-qubit quantum simulator with nuclear spins. Our work reveals the distinctive dynamic features in the triple-qubit PT-symmetric system and paves the way for practical quantum simulation of multiparty non-Hermitian system on quantum computers.

TI QUBO formulation for aircraft load optimization

The problem is realistic based on plans of a certain aircraft model, the Airbus A330 200F, and can be adapted to other models from other manufacturers. We maximize a characteristic of the combination of containers (unit load device, ULD) to be transported, be it weight, volume, profit, or another, while complying with necessary parameters related to the flight such as the balance of the center of gravity as well as stress in the structure. Finally, examples of the results of different runs on QUBO in the D-Wave simulator are presented.

SO OPTICS LETTERS
AB Generation of a local magnetic field at the nanoscale is desirable for many applications such as spin-qubit-based quantum memories. However, this is a challenge due to the slow decay of static magnetic fields. Here, we demonstrate a photonic spin density (PSD)-induced effective static magnetic field for an ensemble of nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in bulk diamond. This locally induced magnetic field is a result of coherent interaction between the optical excitation and the NV centers. We demonstrate an optically induced spin rotation on the Bloch sphere exceeding 10 degrees which has potential applications in all-optical coherent control of spin qubits.

TI Low-Density Parity-Check Codes as Stable Phases of Quantum Matter
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB Phases of matter with robust ground-state degeneracy, such as the quantum toric code, are known to be capable of robust quantum information storage. Here, we address the converse question: given a quantum error-correcting code, when does it define a stable gapped quantum phase of matter, whose ground-state degeneracy is robust against perturbations in the thermodynamic limit? We prove that a low-density parity-check (LDPC) code defines such a phase, robust against all few-body perturbations, if its code distance grows at least logarithmically in the number of degrees of freedom, and it exhibits "check soundness." Many constant-rate quantum LDPC expander codes have such properties, and define stable phases of matter with a constant zero-temperature entropy density, violating the third law of thermodynamics. Our results also show that quantum toric-code phases are robust to spatially nonlocal few-body perturbations. Similarly, phases of matter defined by classical codes are stable against symmetric perturbations. In the classical setting, we present improved locality bounds on the quasiadiabatic evolution operator between two nearby states in the same code phase.

TI Additively manufactured ultra-high vacuum chamber for portable quantum
   technologies
SO ADDITIVE MANUFACTURING
AB Additive manufacturing is having a dramatic impact on research and industry across multiple sectors, but the production of additively manufactured systems for ultra-high vacuum applications has so far proved elusive and widely been considered impossible. We demonstrate the first additively manufactured vacuum chamber operating at a pressure below 10 10 mbar, measured via an ion pump current reading, and show that the corresponding upper limit on the total gas output of the additively manufactured material is 3.6 x 10(-13) mbar l/(smm(2)). The chamber is produced from AlSi10Mg by laser powder bed fusion. Detailed surface analysis reveals that an oxidised, Mg-rich surface layer forms on the additively manufactured material and plays a key role in enabling vacuum compatibility. Our results not only enable lightweight, compact versions of existing systems, but also facilitate rapid prototyping and unlock hitherto inaccessible options in experimental science by removing the constraints that traditional manufacturing considerations impose on component design. This is particularly relevant to the burgeoning field of portable quantum sensors - a point that we illustrate by using the chamber to create a magneto-optical trap for cold Rb-85 atoms - and will impact significantly on all application areas of high and ultra-high vacuum.

TI Electron cascade for distant spin readout
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB The spin of a single electron in a semiconductor quantum dot provides a well-controlled and long-lived qubit implementation. The electron charge in turn allows control of the position of individual electrons in a quantum dot array, and enables charge sensors to probe the charge configuration. Here we show that the Coulomb repulsion allows an initial charge transition to induce subsequent charge transitions, inducing a cascade of electron hops, like toppling dominoes. A cascade can transmit information along a quantum dot array over a distance that extends by far the effect of the direct Coulomb repulsion. We demonstrate that a cascade of electrons can be combined with Pauli spin blockade to read out distant spins and show results with potential for high fidelity using a remote charge sensor in a quadruple quantum dot device. We implement and analyse several operating modes for cascades and analyse their scaling behaviour. We also discuss the application of cascade-based spin readout to densely-packed two-dimensional quantum dot arrays with charge sensors placed at the periphery. The high connectivity of such arrays greatly improves the capabilities of quantum dot systems for quantum computation and simulation. Readout of remote spins in quantum dot arrays is a challenge for future quantum computing architectures. Here, the authors implement electron cascade for spin readout on quantum dots far away from a charge sensor in a quadruple quantum dot device and discuss its applicability to large-scale arrays.

TI Conditions for advantageous quantum Bitcoin mining
SO BLOCKCHAIN-RESEARCH AND APPLICATIONS
AB Our aim is to determine the conditions for quantum computing technology to give rise to the security risks associated with quantum Bitcoin mining. Specifically, we determine the speed and energy efficiency a quantum computer needs to offer an advantage over classical mining. We analyze the setting in which the Bitcoin network is entirely classical except for a single quantum miner with a small hash rate compared to the network. We develop a closed-form approximation for the probability that the quantum miner successfully mines a block, with this probability dependent on the number of Grover iterations the quantum miner applies before making a measurement. Next, we show that for a quantum miner that is "peaceful", this success probability is maximized if the quantum miner applies Grover iterations for 16 min before measuring, which is surprising, as the network mines blocks every 10 min on average. Using this optimal mining procedure, we show that the quantum miner outperforms a classical computer in efficiency (cost per block) if the condition Q < Crb is satisfied, where Q is the cost of a Grover iteration, C is the cost of a classical hash, r is the quantum miner's speed in Grover iterations per second, and b is a factor that attains its maximum if the quantum miner uses our optimal mining procedure. This condition lays the foundation for determining when quantum mining and the known security risks associated with it will arise.

TI General Expressions for the Quantum Fisher Information Matrix with
   Applications to Discrete Quantum Imaging
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB The quantum Fisher information matrix is a central object in multiparameter quantum estimation theory. It is usually challenging to obtain analytical expressions for it because most calculationmethods rely on the diagonalization of the density matrix. In this paper, we derive general expressions for the quantum Fisher information matrix that bypass matrix diagonalization and do not require the expansion of operators on an orthonormal set of states. Additionally, we can tackle density matrices of arbitrary rank. The methods presented here simplify analytical calculations considerably when, for example, the density matrix is more naturally expressed in terms of nonorthogonal states, such as coherent states. Our derivation relies on two matrix inverses that, in principle, can be evaluated analytically even when the density matrix is not diagonalizable in closed form. We demonstrate the power of our approach by deriving novel results in the timely field of discrete quantum imaging: the estimation of positions and intensities of incoherent point sources. We find analytical expressions for the full estimation problem of two point sources with different intensities and for specific examples with three point sources. We expect that our method will become standard in quantum metrology.

TI A New Logical Measure for Quantum Information
SO QUANTUM INFORMATION & COMPUTATION
AB Starting at the logical level of the logic of partitions, dual to the usual Boolean logic of subsets, the notion of logical entropy, i.e., information as distinctions, is developed as the quantification of the distinctions of partitions-just as probability theory starts with the quantification of elements of subsets. Logical entropy is compared and contrasted with the usual notion of Shannon entropy. Then a semi-algorithmic procedure (from the mathematical folklore) is used to translate the notion of logical entropy at the set level to the corresponding notion of quantum logical entropy at the (Hilbert) vector space level. Examples and some important propositions relate quantum logical entropy to projective measurement and to the Hilbert-Schmidt distance. Overall, the approach demonstrates the logical basis and naturality of this notion of entropy for quantum mechanics.

TI String breaking in the heavy quark limit with scalable circuits
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW D
AB Quantum simulations of non-Abelian gauge theories require efficient mappings onto quantum computers and practical state preparation and measurement procedures. A truncation of the Hilbert space of non-Abelian lattice gauge theories with matter in the heavy quark limit is developed. This truncation is applied to SU(2) lattice gauge theory in 1 + 1D to map the theory efficiently onto a quantum computer. Scalable variational circuits are found to prepare the vacuum and single meson states. It is also shown how these state preparation circuits can be used to perform measurements of the number of mesons produced during the system's time evolution. A state with a single qq<overline> pair is prepared on quantum hardware and the inelastic production of qq<overline> pairs is observed using 104 qubits on IBM's Heron quantum computer IBM_TORINO.

TI Variational Amplitude Amplification for Solving QUBO Problems
SO QUANTUM REPORTS
AB We investigate the use of amplitude amplification on the gate-based model of quantum computing as a means for solving combinatorial optimization problems. This study focuses primarily on quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO) problems, which are well-suited for qubit superposition states. Specifically, we demonstrate circuit designs which encode QUBOs as 'cost oracle' operations UC, which distribute phases across the basis states proportional to a cost function. We then show that when UC is combined with the standard Grover diffusion operator Us, one can achieve high probabilities of measurement for states corresponding to optimal and near optimal solutions while still only requiring O(pi 42N/M) iterations. In order to achieve these probabilities, a single scalar parameter ps is required, which we show can be found through a variational quantum-classical hybrid approach and can be used for heuristic solutions.

TI Jenga-Krotov algorithm: Efficient compilation of multiqubit gates for
   exchange-only qubits
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Exchange-only (EO) qubits, implemented in triple-quantum-dot systems, offer a compelling platform for scalable semiconductor-based quantum computing by enabling universal control through purely exchange interactions. While high-fidelity single- and two-qubit gates have been demonstrated, the synthesis of efficient multiqubit operations-such as the Toffoli gate-remains a key bottleneck. Conventional gate decompositions into elementary operations lead to prohibitively long and error-prone pulse sequences, limiting practical deployment. In this work, we introduce a gradient-based optimization algorithm, Jenga-Krotov (JK), tailored to discover compact, high-fidelity EO gate sequences. Applying JK to the Toffoli gate, we reduce the number of required exchange unitaries from 216 (in direct decomposition) to 92, and compress the time steps required from 162 to 50, all while maintaining target fidelity. Under realistic noise, the accumulated gate error from our optimized sequence is an order of magnitude lower than that of conventional approaches. We have also applied the JK algorithm to other multiqubit gates and algorithm. For the Fredkin gate, it reduces the number of time steps from 200 to 104 and the number of exchange unitaries from 276 to 172. For the quantum Fourier transform, it compresses the sequence from 180 to 80 time steps and from 237 to 202 exchange unitaries. These results demonstrate that the JK algorithm is a general and scalable strategy for multiqubit gate synthesis in EO architectures, potentially facilitating realization of multiqubit algorithms on semiconductor platforms.

TI Quantum Implementation of AIM: Aiming for Low-Depth
SO APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL
AB Security vulnerabilities in the symmetric-key primitives of a cipher can undermine the overall security claims of the cipher. With the rapid advancement of quantum computing in recent years, there is an increasing effort to evaluate the security of symmetric-key cryptography against potential quantum attacks. This paper focuses on analyzing the quantum attack resistance of AIM, a symmetric-key primitive used in the AIMer digital signature scheme. We present the first quantum circuit implementation of AIM and estimate its complexity (such as qubit count, gate count, and circuit depth) with respect to Grover's search algorithm. For Grover's key search, the most important optimization metric is depth, especially when considering parallel search. Our implementation gathers multiple methods for a low-depth quantum circuit of AIM in order to reduce the Toffoli depth and full depth (such as the Karatsuba multiplication and optimization of inner modules; Mer, LinearLayer).

TI Some New Quantum BCH Codes over Finite Fields
SO ENTROPY
AB Quantum error correcting codes (QECCs) play an important role in preventing quantum information decoherence. Good quantum stabilizer codes were constructed by classical error correcting codes. In this paper, Bose-Chaudhuri-Hocquenghem (BCH) codes over finite fields are used to construct quantum codes. First, we try to find such classical BCH codes, which contain their dual codes, by studying the suitable cyclotomic cosets. Then, we construct nonbinary quantum BCH codes with given parameter sets. Finally, a new family of quantum BCH codes can be realized by Steane's enlargement of nonbinary Calderbank-Shor-Steane (CSS) construction and Hermitian construction. We have proven that the cyclotomic cosets are good tools to study quantum BCH codes. The defining sets contain the highest numbers of consecutive integers. Compared with the results in the references, the new quantum BCH codes have better code parameters without restrictions and better lower bounds on minimum distances. What is more, the new quantum codes can be constructed over any finite fields, which enlarges the range of quantum BCH codes.

TI Phase noise model for continuous-variable quantum key distribution using
   a local local oscillator
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB The value of residual phase noise, after phase compensation, is one of the key limitations of performance improvement for continuous-variable quantum key distribution using a local local oscillator (LLO CV-QKD) system, since it is the major excess noise. However, due to the nonideality of the realistic devices implemented in practice, for example, imperfect lasers, detectors, and unbalanced interferometers, the value of residual phase noise in the current system is still relatively large. Here, we develop a phase noise model to improve the phase noise tolerance of the LLO CV-QKD schemes. In our model, part of the phase-reference measurement noise associated with detection efficiency and electronic noise of Bob's detector as well as a real-time monitored phasereference intensity at Bob's side is considered trusted because it can be locally calibrated by Bob. We show that using our phase noise model can significantly improve the secure key rate and transmission distance of the LLO CV-QKD system. We further conduct an experiment to substantiate the superiority of the phase noise model. Based on experimental data of a LLO CV-QKD system in the 25-km optical fiber channel, we demonstrate that the secure key rate under our phase noise model is approximately 40% higher than that under the conventional phase noise model.

TI Testing complementarity on a transmon quantum processor
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB We propose quantum circuits to test interferometric complementarity using symmetric two-way interferometers coupled to a which-path detector. First, we consider the two-qubit setup in which the controlled transfer of path information to the detector subsystem depletes interference on the probed subspace, testing the visibility-distinguishability tradeoff via minimum-error state discrimination measurements. Next, we consider the quantum eraser setup, in which reading out path information in the right basis recovers an interference pattern. These experiments are then carried out in an IBM superconducting transmon processor. A detailed analysis of the results is provided. Despite finding good agreement with theory at a coarse level, we also identify small but persistent systematic deviations preventing the observation of full particlelike and wavelike statistics. We understand them by carefully modeling two-qubit gates, showing that even small coherent errors in their implementation preclude the observation of Bohr's strong formulation of complementarity.

TI Protecting quantum information in quantum dot spin chains by driving
   exchange interactions periodically
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
AB Recent work has demonstrated a new route to discrete time crystal physics in quantum spin chains by periodically driving nearest-neighbor exchange interactions in gate-defined quantum dot arrays [H. Qiao et al., Nat. Commun. 12, 2142 (2021)]. Here, we present a detailed analysis of exchange-driven Floquet physics in small arrays of GaAs quantum dots, including phase diagrams and additional diagnostics. We also show that emergent time-crystalline behavior can benefit the protection and manipulation of multispin states. For typical levels of nuclear spin noise in GaAs, the combination of driving and interactions increases the coherence times of entangled states by orders of magnitude. Similar results can be obtained for other quantum dot systems such as in Si. We further show how to construct a time-crystal-inspired cz gate between singlet-triplet qubits with high fidelity. These results show that periodically driving exchange couplings can enhance the performance of quantum dot spin systems for quantum information applications.

TI Digital quantum simulation, learning of the Floquet Hamiltonian, and
   quantum chaos of the kicked top
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICS A-MATHEMATICAL AND THEORETICAL
AB The kicked top is one of the paradigmatic models in the study of quantum chaos (Haake et al 2018 Quantum Signatures of Chaos (Springer Series in Synergetics vol 54)). Recently it has been shown that the onset of quantum chaos in the kicked top can be related to the proliferation of Trotter errors in digital quantum simulation (DQS) of collective spin systems. Specifically, the proliferation of Trotter errors becomes manifest in expectation values of few-body observables strongly deviating from the target dynamics above a critical Trotter step, where the spectral statistics of the Floquet operator of the kicked top can be predicted by random matrix theory. In this work, we study these phenomena in the framework of Hamiltonian learning (HL). We show how a recently developed HL protocol can be employed to reconstruct the generator of the stroboscopic dynamics, i.e., the Floquet Hamiltonian, of the kicked top. We further show how the proliferation of Trotter errors is revealed by HL as the transition to a regime in which the dynamics cannot be approximately described by a low-order truncation of the Floquet-Magnus expansion. This opens up new experimental possibilities for the analysis of Trotter errors on the level of the generator of the implemented dynamics, that can be generalized to the DQS of quantum many-body systems in a scalable way. This paper is in memory of our colleague and friend Fritz Haake.

TI Waveguide excitation and spin pumping of chirally coupled quantum dots
SO OPTICA
AB On-chip excitation of single quantum emitters is a key requirement for developing scalable quantum photonic technologies. Here, we report a remote excitation protocol on an integrated semiconductor chip, in which a single quantum dot (QD) is driven in-plane via a photonic-crystal waveguide through a p-shell optical transition. The chirality of the waveguide mode is exploited to achieve both directional absorption and directional emission, resulting in a substantial enhancement in directional contrast, as measured for the Zeeman components of the waveguide-coupled QD. This remote excitation scheme enables near-unity directionality (>= 0.95) across <^>56% of the waveguide area, with significant overlap with the Purcell-enhanced region, where the electric field intensity profile is near its peak. In contrast, conventional out-of-plane local excitation yields only <^>25% overlap. This enhancement increases the likelihood of locating Purcell-enhanced QDs in regions that support high directionality, allowing the experimental demonstration of a six-fold enhancement in the decay rate of a QD with directionality of 90 +/- 3%. The remote p-shell excitation protocol thus establishes a benchmark for waveguide quantum optics by combining Purcell enhancement with high directionality. This approach enables efficient on-chip spin initialization and control in solid-state quantum technologies operating in high-beta-factor regimes, with implications for scalable quantum networks and integrated devices.

TI Solving non-Hermitian physics for optical manipulation on a quantum
   computer
SO LIGHT-SCIENCE & APPLICATIONS
AB Intense laser light, with its ability to trap small particles, is providing us unprecedented access to the microscopic world. Nevertheless, owing to its open nature, optical force is nonconservative and can only be described by a non-Hermitian theory. This non-Hermiticity sets such system apart from conventional systems and has offered rich physics, such as the possession of the exceptional points. Consequently, analyzing and demonstrating the dynamics of large optically-bound clusters becomes an intricate challenge. Here, we developed a scalable quantum approach that allows us to predict the trajectories of optically trapped particles and tackle the associated non-Hermitian physics. This approach is based on the linear combination of unitary operations. With this, we experimentally revealed the non-Hermiticity and exceptional point for a single or multiple particles trapped by optical force fields, using a nuclear magnetic resonance quantum processor. Our method's scalability and stability have offering a promising path for large-scale optical manipulation with non-Hermitian dynamics.

TI Quasiparticle Poisoning of Superconducting Qubits from Resonant
   Absorption of Pair-Breaking Photons
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB The ideal superconductor provides a pristine environment for the delicate states of a quantum computer: because there is an energy gap to excitations, there are no spurious modes with which the qubits can interact, causing irreversible decay of the quantum state. As a practical matter, however, there exists a high density of excitations out of the superconducting ground state even at ultralow temperature; these are known as quasiparticles. Observed quasiparticle densities are of order 1 mu m-3, tens of orders of magnitude greater than the equilibrium density expected from theory. Nonequilibrium quasiparticles extract energy from the qubit mode and can induce dephasing. Here we show that a dominant mechanism for quasiparticle poisoning is direct absorption of high-energy photons at the qubit junction. We use a Josephson junctionbased photon source to controllably dose qubit circuits with millimeter -wave radiation, and we use an interferometric quantum gate sequence to reconstruct the charge parity of the qubit. We find that the structure of the qubit itself acts as a resonant antenna for millimeter -wave radiation, providing an efficient path for photons to generate quasiparticles. A deep understanding of this physics will pave the way to realization of next -generation superconducting qubits that are robust against quasiparticle poisoning.

TI Two-Step Quantum Search Algorithm for Solving Traveling Salesman
   Problems
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON QUANTUM ENGINEERING
AB Quantum search algorithms, such as Grover's algorithm, are anticipated to efficiently solve constrained combinatorial optimization problems. However, applying these algorithms to the traveling salesman problem (TSP) on a quantum circuit presents a significant challenge. Existing quantum search algorithms for the TSP typically assume that an initial state-an equal superposition of all feasible solutions satisfying the problem's constraints-is pre-prepared. The query complexity of preparing this state using brute-force methods scales exponentially with the factorial growth of feasible solutions, creating a significant hurdle in designing quantum circuits for large-scale TSPs. To address this issue, we propose a two-step quantum search (TSQS) algorithm that employs two sets of operators. In the first step, all the feasible solutions are amplified into their equal superposition state. In the second step, the optimal solution state is amplified from this superposition state. The TSQS algorithm demonstrates greater efficiency compared to conventional search algorithms that employ a single oracle operator for finding a solution within the encoded space. Encoded in the higher order unconstrained binary optimization representation, our approach significantly reduces the qubit requirements. This enables efficient initial state preparation through a unified circuit design, offering a quadratic speedup in solving the TSP without prior knowledge of feasible solutions.

TI Development of 400-μW cryogen-free dilution refrigerators for quantum
   experiments
SO CHINESE PHYSICS B
AB We have successfully developed cryogen-free dilution refrigerators with medium cooling power that can be applied to quantum experiments. Breakthroughs have been made in some key technologies and components of heat switches and dilution units. Our prototype has been running continuously and stably for more than 100 hours below 10 mK, with a minimum temperature of 7.6 mK and a cooling power of 450 mu W at 100 mK. At the same time, we have also made progress in the application of dilution refrigerators, such as quantum computing, low-temperature detector, and magnet integration. These indicators and test results indicate good prospects for application in physics, astronomy, and quantum information.

TI Fast algorithms for classical specifications of stabiliser states and
   Clifford gates
SO QUANTUM
AB The stabiliser formalism plays a central role in quantum computing, error correction, and fault tolerance. Conversions between and verifications of different specifications of stabiliser states and Clifford gates are important components of many classical algorithms in quantum information, e.g. for gate synthesis, circuit optimisation, and simulating quantum circuits. These core functions are also used in the numerical experiments critical to formulating and testing mathematical conjectures on the stabiliser formalism. We develop novel mathematical insights concerning stabiliser states and Clifford gates that significantly clarify their descriptions. We then utilise these to provide ten new fast algorithms which offer asymptotic advantages over any existing implementations. We show how to rapidly verify that a vector is a stabiliser state, and interconvert between its specification as amplitudes, a quadratic form, and a check matrix. These methods are leveraged to rapidly check if a given unitary matrix is a Clifford gate and to interconvert between the matrix of a Clifford gate and its compact specification as a stabiliser tableau. For example, we extract the stabiliser tableau of a 2n x 2n matrix, promised to be a Clifford gate, in O(n2n) time. Remarkably, it is not necessary to read all the elements of a Clifford gate matrix to extract its stabiliser tableau. This is an asymptotic speedup over the best-known method that is exponential in the number of qubits. We provide implementations of our algorithms in Python and C++ that exhibit vastly improved practical performance over existing algorithms in the cases where they exist.

TI Enhanced-rate continuous-variable quantum key distribution with particle
   filter-based carrier phase recovery
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB Local local oscillator (LLO) continuous-variable quantum key distribution (CVQKD) schemes have been extensively studied for their enhanced security and simplified system implementation. However, such schemes typically require numerous pilot signals to compensate for phase drift caused by two independent lasers, which significantly increases system overhead and limits the achievable secret key rate. In this work, we propose an enhanced-rate CVQKD scheme, which aims to enhance the secret key rate by achieving high-accuracy phase compensation based on a particle filter (PF) algorithm under low system overhead. Specifically, to counter the loss in phase estimation accuracy due to the reduced number of pilot signals, we introduce a PF-based carrier phase recovery algorithm, complemented by an exponentially weighted phase prediction method to improve phase estimation accuracy. This approach effectively suppresses excess noise under limited pilot information and improves phase compensation precision. Experimental results demonstrate that, compared to the traditional scheme with a 1:1 signal-to-pilot number ratio, our method achieves its maximum performance with a signal-to-pilot number ratio of 3:1, while maintaining phase compensation accuracy virtually unchanged, reducing system overhead by 50% and achieving a 147% improvement in the secret key rate, reaching 235 kbps in a 30 km standard fiber link.

TI Twin-field quantum key distribution with optical injection locking and
   phase encoding on-chip
SO OPTICA
AB Twin-field (TF) quantum key distribution (QKD) has been proved to overcome the linear rate-distance limit of repeaterless quantum communications and has the capability to generate high key rates over long distances compared with other QKD protocols. Photonic integration has proven a promising technique for the large-scale deployment of QKD. While it has been adopted to implement a range of linearly scaling QKD protocols, there is to date no demonstration of TF QKD using photonic integrated chips. One important challenge resides in establishing high coherence between remote laser chips. In this study, we exploit optical injection locking to implement phase dissemination to independent lasers integrated onto photonic circuits and further demonstrate complete phase control on the same chip using electro-optic phase modulators. We achieve high laser coherence between remote transmitter nodes, which lets us demonstrate a quadratic key-rate improvement of the secure key rate beyond 80 dB of channel attenuation. The experimental results are in excellent agreement with the theory in both finite size and asymptotic regimes, in which the fundamental rate-distance limit is overcome. Our work paves the way for the deployment of large-scale TF QKD networks enabled by compact, lowcost, and high-yield chip-based devices.

TI Dynamics of single-mode nonclassicalities and quantum correlations in
   the Jaynes-Cummings model
SO JOURNAL OF THE OPTICAL SOCIETY OF AMERICA B-OPTICAL PHYSICS
AB Dynamics of atom-field correlations and single-mode nonclassicalities present in the resonant Jaynes-Cummings model are investigated using negativity and entanglement potential for a set of initial states. The study has revealed the interplay among three different types of nonclassicalities present in the model and established that the nonclassicality is continuously exchanged between the field and atom through atom-field correlations. Further, it is observed that the entanglement potential does not capture all single-mode nonclassicality, and there exists some residual nonclassicality in the reduced single-mode states at the output of the beam splitter that is not captured by the entanglement in which single-mode nonclassicality is quantitatively mapped in Asboth's criterion. Additional layers of beam splitters are added to deplete all the nonclassicality and to reveal that almost all residual nonclassicality is captured with three layers of beam splitters. Further, the reduced states of the atom and field have zero (non-zero) quantum coherence in the Fock basis when the atom-field correlations are maximum if the field (or atom) has zero (non-zero) quantum coherence initially.

TI Quantum Error-Corrected Non-Markovian Metrology
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB Quantum metrology aims to maximize measurement precision on quantum systems, with a wide range of applications in quantum sensing. Achieving the Heisenberg limit (HL)-the fundamental precision bound set by quantum mechanics-is often hindered by noise-induced decoherence, which typically reduces achievable precision to the standard quantum limit (SQL). While quantum error correction (QEC) can recover the HL under Markovian noise, its applicability to non-Markovian noise remains less explored. In this work, we analyze a hidden Markov model (HMM) in which a quantum probe, coupled to an inaccessible environment, undergoes joint evolution described by Lindbladian dynamics, with the inaccessible degrees of freedom serving as a memory. We derive generalized Knill-Laflamme conditions for the HMM and establish three types of sufficient conditions for achieving the HL under non-Markovian noise using QEC. Additionally, we demonstrate the attainability of the SQL when these sufficient conditions are violated, by analytical solutions for special cases and numerical methods for general scenarios. Our results not only extend prior QEC frameworks for metrology but also provide new insights into precision limits under realistic noise conditions.

We evaluate the noise and imperfections associated with this novel approach and compare our findings with existing CV-QKD schemes. Notably, our calculations demonstrate significantly lower noise levels compared to other locally generated local oscillator-based CV-QKD schemes. Furthermore, we assess the secure key rate and achievable distance under collective attack for our proposed scheme and compare it to other variants of CV-QKD protocols employing a true local oscillator. Our results align well with experimental data, highlighting the promise of our approach. (c) 2023 Optica Publishing Group under the terms of the Optica Open Access Publishing Agreement

TI Quantum Engineering With Hybrid Magnonic Systems and Materials
   (Invited Paper)
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON QUANTUM ENGINEERING
AB Quantum technology has made tremendous strides over the past two decades with remarkable advances in materials engineering, circuit design, and dynamic operation. In particular, the integration of different quantum modules has benefited from hybrid quantum systems, which provide an important pathway for harnessing different natural advantages of complementary quantum systems and for engineering new functionalities. This review article focuses on the current frontiers with respect to utilizing magnons for novel quantum functionalities. Magnons are the fundamental excitations of magnetically ordered solid-state materials and provide great tunability and flexibility for interacting with various quantum modules for integration in diverse quantum systems. The concomitant-rich variety of physics and material selection enable exploration of novel quantum phenomena in materials science and engineering. In addition, the ease of generating strong coupling with other excitations makes hybrid magnonics a unique platform for quantum engineering. We start our discussion with circuit-based hybrid magnonic systems, which are coupled with microwave photons and acoustic phonons. Subsequently, we focus on the recent progress of magnon-magnon coupling within confined magnetic systems. Next, we highlight new opportunities for understanding the interactions between magnons and nitrogen-vacancy centers for quantum sensing and implementing quantum interconnects. Lastly, we focus on the spin excitations and magnon spectra of novel quantum materials investigated with advanced optical characterization.

TI Fidelity and efficiency analysis for heralded entanglement swapping in
   lossy channels: Linear and nonlinear optical approaches
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Bell-state measurements (BSMs) of photonic qubits are used for quantum networking protocols to herald the distribution and transfer of quantum information. However, standard BSMs based on linear optics (LO-BSMs) require identical photons and are susceptible to errors from multiphoton emissions, leading to reduced fidelity of protocols, particularly in the absence of postselection. To overcome these challenges, Bell state measurements based on nonlinear optics (NLO-BSMs) have been proposed and implemented, leveraging sum-frequency generation (SFG) to filter out multiphoton emissions and improve the fidelity without postselection. Here, we analyze the fidelity of LO-BSM and NLO-BSM heralded entanglement swapping in lossy channels and compare their performance under realistic conditions. We also explore the impact of state-of-the-art nonlinear photonics platforms on SFG efficiency and highlight how advances in nanophotonics will enable practical, high-fidelity NLO-BSM-based quantum networking applications.

TI A live digital forensics approach for quantum mechanical computers
SO FORENSIC SCIENCE INTERNATIONAL-DIGITAL INVESTIGATION
AB In this paper, an exploration of reversing quantum computer gates is addressed as an avenue for collecting forensic evidence from a quantum computer. To date, little forensic research exists on quantum computing systems in general, and practically no experiments exist in the live recovery context. This work discusses the means for live forensics of quantum computers via both a look at current research on the matter, and through a demonstration of live data collection. The results are a combination of analysis conducted on real quantum systems to produce a quantum forensic methodology. Furthermore, this work will highlight the viability of live forensics, and largely refute Overill's assertion that it is not possible to perform live forensics on quantum systems. We believe that this work represents a very strong step towards revolutionizing the entire field of quantum forensics. (c) 2022 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

TI Unleashed from constrained optimization: quantum computing for quantum
   chemistry employing generator coordinate inspired method
SO NPJ QUANTUM INFORMATION
AB Hybrid quantum-classical approaches offer potential solutions to quantum chemistry problems, yet they often manifest as constrained optimization problems. Here, we explore the interconnection between constrained optimization and generalized eigenvalue problems through the Unitary Coupled Cluster (UCC) excitation generators. Inspired by the generator coordinate method, we employ these UCC excitation generators to construct non-orthogonal, overcomplete many-body bases, projecting the system Hamiltonian into an effective Hamiltonian, which bypasses issues such as barren plateaus that heuristic numerical minimizers often encountered in standard variational quantum eigensolver (VQE). Diverging from conventional quantum subspace expansion methods, we introduce an adaptive scheme that robustly constructs the many-body basis sets from a pool of the UCC excitation generators. This scheme supports the development of a hierarchical ADAPT quantum-classical strategy, enabling a balanced interplay between subspace expansion and ansatz optimization to address complex, strongly correlated quantum chemical systems cost-effectively, setting the stage for more advanced quantum simulations in chemistry.

TI Classifying entanglement by algebraic geometry
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF QUANTUM INFORMATION
AB Quantum Entanglement is one of the key manifestations of quantum mechanics that separate the quantum realm from the classical one. Characterization of entanglement as a physical resource for quantum technology became of uppermost importance. While the entanglement of bipartite systems is already well understood, the ultimate goal to cope with the properties of entanglement of multipartite systems is still far from being realized. This paper covers characterization of multipartite entanglement using algebraic-geometric tools. First, we establish an algorithm to classify multipartite entanglement by k-secant varieties of the Segre variety and l-multilinear ranks that are invariant under Stochastic Local Operations with Classical Communication (SLOCC). We present a fine-structure classification of multiqubit and tripartite entanglement based on this algorithm. Another fundamental problem in quantum information theory is entanglement transformation that is quite challenging regarding to multipartite systems. It is captivating that the proposed entanglement classification by algebraic geometry can be considered as a reference to study SLOCC and asymptotic SLOCC interconversions among different resources based on tensor rank and border rank, respectively. In this regard, we also introduce a new class of tensors that we call persistent tensors and construct a lower bound for their tensor rank. We further cover SLOCC convertibility of multipartite systems considering several families of persistent tensors.

AB This paper presents a quantum-safe watchdog timer protocol de-signed and implemented using various quantum-safe digital sig-nature algorithms. The protocol is specifically tailored to be used in the context of the Internet of Things (IoT) to address the se-curity risks posed by quantum computing to classical protocols. Our approach replaces the classical protocol with a quantum-safe watchdog timer protocol, which ensures that an IoT device's com-munication channels remain secure from adversarial attacks.
   To demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed protocol, we develop a proof-of- concept (PoC) implementation using an actor framework in Python. We evaluate the performance impact of the proposed protocol based on several IoT scenarios. We also compare the performance of different quantum-safe algorithms using mea-surements of CPU cycles, and quantitatively evaluate the results using statistical methods.
   Our results indicate that the performance of the tested quantum-safe algorithms is better or similar to that of the tested classical algo-rithms. Based on these results, we recommend a specific quantum-safe algorithm for use with the watchdog timer protocol in the IoT context. The proposed protocol and recommended quantum-safe algorithm offer an effective way to address the security risks posed by quantum computing to IoT devices, and are a significant contribution to the field of quantum-safe cryptography.

TI A bright and fast source of coherent single photons
SO NATURE NANOTECHNOLOGY
AB A single-photon source is an enabling technology in device-independent quantum communication(1), quantum simulation(2,3), and linear optics-based(4) and measurement-based quantum computing(5). These applications employ many photons and place stringent requirements on the efficiency of single-photon creation. The scaling on efficiency is typically an exponential function of the number of photons. Schemes taking full advantage of quantum superpositions also depend sensitively on the coherence of the photons, that is, their indistinguishability(6). Here, we report a single-photon source with a high end-to-end efficiency. We employ gated quantum dots in an open, tunable microcavity(7). The gating provides control of the charge and electrical tuning of the emission frequency; the high-quality material ensures low noise; and the tunability of the microcavity compensates for the lack of control in quantum dot position and emission frequency. Transmission through the top mirror is the dominant escape route for photons from the microcavity, and this output is well matched to a single-mode fibre. With this design, we can create a single photon at the output of the final optical fibre on-demand with a probability of up to 57% and with an average two-photon interference visibility of 97.5%. Coherence persists in trains of thousands of photons with single-photon creation at a repetition rate of 1 GHz.

TI A planar defect spin sensor in a two-dimensional material susceptible to
   strain and electric fields
SO NPJ COMPUTATIONAL MATERIALS
AB The boron-vacancy spin defect (V-B(-)) in hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) has a great potential as a quantum sensor in a two-dimensional material that can directly probe various external perturbations in atomic-scale proximity to the quantum sensing layer. Here, we apply first-principles calculations to determine the coupling of the V-B(-) electronic spin to strain and electric fields. Our work unravels the interplay between local piezoelectric and elastic effects contributing to the final response to the electric fields. The theoretical predictions are then used to analyse optically detected magnetic resonance (ODMR) spectra recorded on hBN crystals containing different densities of V-B(-) centres. We prove that the orthorhombic zero-field splitting parameter results from local electric fields produced by surrounding charge defects. This work paves the way towards applications of V-B(-) centres for quantitative electric field imaging and quantum sensing under pressure.

AB Quantum state preparation initializes the quantum registers and is essential for running quantum algorithms. Designing state preparation circuits that entangle qubits efficiently with fewer two-qubit gates enhances accuracy and alleviates coupling constraints on devices. Existing methods synthesize an initial circuit and leverage compilers to reduce the circuit's gate count while preserving the unitary equivalency. In this study, we identify numerous conditions within the quantum circuit where breaking local unitary equivalences does not alter the overall outcome of the state preparation (i.e., don't cares). We introduce a peephole optimization algorithm that identifies such unitaries for replacement in the original circuit. Exploiting these don't care conditions, our algorithm achieves a 36% reduction in the number of two-qubit gates compared to prior methods.

TI Simulating photonic devices with noisy optical elements
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Quantum computers are inherently affected by noise. While in the long term, error correction codes will account for noise at the cost of increasing physical qubits, in the near term, the performance of any quantum algorithm should be tested and simulated in the presence of noise. As noise acts on the hardware, the classical simulation of a quantum algorithm should not be agnostic on the platform used for the computation. In this paper, we apply the recently proposed noisy gates approach to efficiently simulate noisy optical circuits described in the dual rail framework. The evolution of the state vector is simulated directly, without requiring the mapping to the density matrix framework. Notably, we test the method on both the gate-based and measurement-based quantum computing models, showing that the approach is very versatile. We also evaluate the performance of a photonic variational quantum algorithm to solve the MAX-2-CUT problem. In particular we design and simulate an ansatz, which is resilient to photon losses up to p similar to 10(-3) making it relevant for near-term applications.

TI Decomposition pipeline for large-scale portfolio optimization with
   applications to near-term quantum computing
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Industrially relevant constrained optimization problems, such as portfolio optimization and portfolio rebalancing, are often intractable or difficult to solve exactly. In this work, we propose and benchmark a decomposition pipeline targeting portfolio optimization and rebalancing problems with constraints. The pipeline decomposes the optimization problem into constrained subproblems, which are then solved separately and aggregated to give a final result. Our pipeline includes three main components: preprocessing of correlation matrices based on random matrix theory, modified spectral clustering based on Newman's algorithm, and risk rebalancing. Our empirical results show that our pipeline consistently decomposes real-world portfolio optimization problems into subproblems with a size reduction of approximately 80%. Since subproblems are then solved independently, our pipeline drastically reduces the total computation time for state-of-the-art solvers. Moreover, by decomposing large problems into several smaller subproblems, the pipeline enables the use of near-term quantum devices as solvers, providing a path toward practical utility of quantum computers in portfolio optimization.

TI Single-qubit rotation algorithm with logarithmic Toffoli count and gate
   depth
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Building generic gates from a restricted gate set is a difficult but important problem, especially in the noisy regime where only a limited set of noise-resistant gates are available, e.g., fault-tolerant Clifford gates (generated by Hadamard, phase, and CNOT gates) and fault-tolerant Toffoli gates. The Toffoli is also often used as a building block of many algorithms and will need to be constructed if not directly available. This makes Clifford+Toffoli an attractive gate set for building generic gates. In this Letter we give a simple and efficient algorithm for building an approximate single-qubit rotation using only Clifford+Toffoli, which in turn enables any generic single-qubit unitary. An important difference compared to earlier attempts is that the use of the Toffoli allows us to use simple rounding as opposed to a complicated approximation algorithm. The resulting gate array does not rely on repeatedly applying a fixed rotation, but immediately applies a rotation R9 that is E-close to the desired rotation R9, with a success probability strictly greater than 1/2. It can be rerun upon failure, giving an expected number of repetitions strictly less than 2, an expected Toffoli count strictly less than 4[log E 1, an expected gate depth strictly less than 4[log E 1 + 6, and uses 2[log E 1 ancillas. The small circuit depth of our construction enables low-noise gates on existing quantum computational devices, and allows for arbitrary precision using a very modest number of ancillas.

TI Dynamics of local quantum uncertainty among cavity-reservoir qubits
SO MODERN PHYSICS LETTERS A
AB We study dynamics of local quantum uncertainty (LQU) for a system of two cavities and two reservoirs. In the start, the cavities are treated as two qubits which are quantum correlated with each other, whereas reservoirs (also qubits) are neither correlated with each other nor with cavities. We answer two main questions in this work. First, how local quantum uncertainty decays from two quantum correlated cavities and grows among reservoirs. The second question is the examination of LQU developed among four qubits and also shed some light on its dynamics. We observe that LQU develops among reservoirs as kind of mirror image to its decay from cavities. For four qubits, we propose how to compute LQU such that the method is intuitive and analytically computable. We find that among four qubits, LQU starts growing from zero to some maximum value and then decays again to zero as the asymptotic state of cavities is completely transferred to reservoirs. We suggest the experimental setup to implement our results.

TI Experimental implementation of quantum-walk-based portfolio optimization
SO QUANTUM SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB The application of quantum algorithms has attracted much attention as it holds the promise of solving practical problems that are intractable to classical algorithms. One such application is the recent development of a quantum-walk-based optimization algorithm approach to portfolio optimization under the modern portfolio theory framework. In this paper, we demonstrate an experimental realization of the alternating phase-shift and continuous-time quantum walk unitaries that underpin this quantum algorithm using optical networks and single photons. The experimental analysis confirms that the probability of states corresponding to high-quality solutions is efficiently amplified by increasing the number of phase-shift and quantum walk iterations. This work provides strong evidence for practical applications of quantum-walk-based algorithms such as financial portfolio optimization.

TI Phase modulation polarization encoding module applied to one-to-many QKD

SO CHINESE OPTICS LETTERS
AB The quantum key distribution (QKD) network is a promising solution for secure communications. In this paper, we proposed a polarization-independent phase-modulated polarization encoding module, and it can be combined with a dense wavelength division multiplexer (DWDM) to achieve multi-user QKD. We experimentally test the encoding module with a repetition rate of 62.5 MHz, and its average quantum bit error rate (QBER) is as low as 0.4%. Finally, we implement a principle verification test for simultaneous QKD for 1 to 2 users in 100 min, and the average QBER of two users under the transmission distance of 1 km and 5 km is kept below 0.8%. Due to the use of polarization encoding, the module can also realize scalable network architecture in free-space QKD systems in the future.

In this work, we show that these ideas can be generalized to field theories in a fixed de Sitter space. Focusing on 1+1-dimensional field theories, we derive a boosted strong subadditivity inequality in de Sitter, and show that it implies a C-theorem for renormalization group flows. Additionally, using the relative entropy, we establish a Lorentzian bound on the entanglement and thermal entropies for a field theory inside the static patch. Finally, we discuss possible connections with recent developments using unitarity methods.

TI Fast Estimation of Sparse Quantum Noise
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB As quantum computers approach the fault-tolerance threshold, diagnosing and characterizing the noise on large-scale quantum devices is increasingly important. One of the most important classes of noise channels is the class of Pauli channels, for reasons of both theoretical tractability and experimental relevance. Here we present a practical algorithm for estimating the s nonzero Pauli error rates in an s-sparse, n-qubit Pauli noise channel, or more generally the s largest Pauli error rates. The algorithm comes with rigorous recovery guarantees and uses only O(n(2)) measurements, O(sn(2)) classical processing time, and Clifford quantum circuits. We experimentally validate a heuristic version of the algorithm that uses simplified Clifford circuits on data from an IBM 14-qubit superconducting device and our open-source implementation. These data show that accurate and precise estimation of the probability of arbitrary-weight Pauli errors is possible even when the signal is 2 orders of magnitude below the measurement noise floor.

TI Interior Point Methods for Structured Quantum Relative Entropy
   Optimization Problems
SO MATHEMATICAL PROGRAMMING COMPUTATION
AB Quantum relative entropy optimization refers to a class of convex problems in which a linear functional is minimized over an affine section of the epigraph of the quantum relative entropy function. Recently, the self-concordance of a natural barrier function was proved for this set, and various implementations of interior-point methods have been made available to solve this class of optimization problems. In this paper, we show how common structures arising from applications in quantum information theory can be exploited to improve the efficiency of solving quantum relative entropy optimization problems using interior-point methods. First, we show that the natural barrier function for the epigraph of the quantum relative entropy composed with positive linear operators is self-concordant, even when these linear operators map to singular matrices. Compared to modeling problems using the full quantum relative entropy cone, this allows us to remove redundant log-determinant expressions from the barrier function and reduce the overall barrier parameter. Second, we show how certain slices of the quantum relative entropy cone exhibit useful properties which should be exploited whenever possible to perform certain key steps of interior-point methods more efficiently. We demonstrate how these methods can be applied to applications in quantum information theory, including quantifying quantum key rates, quantum rate-distortion functions, quantum channel capacities, and the ground state energy of Hamiltonians. Our numerical results show that these techniques improve computation times by up to several orders of magnitude, and allow previously intractable problems to be solved.

TI Achieving the Heisenberg limit of metrology via measurement on an
   ancillary qubit
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB In the scenario of the probe-ancilla interaction, we propose a quantum metrology protocol by the unconditional measurement on the ancillary qubit after an optimized period of joint evolution from a product state. Its key element is the construction of two parallel evolution paths by the measurement that can transform the probe system (a spin ensemble) from an eigenstate of a collective angular momentum operator | j, m) to a superposed s/ state (| j, m) + | j, -m))/ 2. With synchronous parametric encoding and qubit measurement, the quantum Fisher information about the phase encoded in the probe system with optimized initial states can exactly attain the Heisenberg scaling N2 with respect to the probe size (spin number) N. The quadratic scaling behavior is not sensitive to the imprecise control over the joint evolution time, the time delay between encoding and measurement, and the coherence in the probe ensemble or the ancillary system that would be degraded by local dephasing. The classical Fisher information of the spin ensemble is found to saturate with its quantum counterpart, irrespective of the idle joint evolution after the parametric encoding. We suggest that both Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ)-like states and nonlinear Hamiltonian are not necessary resources for exceeding the standard quantum limit in metrology precision since in our protocol even thermal states can hold an asymptotic quadratic scaling.

TI Perfect optomechanically induced transparency and slow light in an
   Rydberg atom-assisted optomechanical system
SO ACTA PHYSICA SINICA
AB Rydberg atoms have attracted considerable attention due to their several singular properties, such as strong long-range interactions, extremely long lifetimes, and very large polarizability. These characteristics make Rydberg atoms a good candidates for cavity quantum electrodynamics, quantum information, and many-body physics. Recently, the study of optomechanics has become a rapidly developing field due to its important applications in cooling of mechanical resonators, implementing precision measurements, slowing light, and preparing quantum entanglement. Obviously, optomechanical systems pave the way for quantum information processing and quantum communication. Specially, there is significant interest in quantum optomechanics due to its high compatibility that can be combined, to build hybrid systems for certain purposes, with the ultracold atoms, a superconducting single electron transistor, a magnetostrictive actuation, a charged oscillator resonator, etc. In this work, we investigate the optomechanically induced transparency (OMIT) and the resulting effect of slow light in a hybrid system composed of a Rydberg atomic ensemble embedded inside a simple optomechanical cavity. As a typical effect of destructive quantum interference, OMIT is widely used in quantum optics and quantum information processing. Based on the Rydberg blockade effect, a Rydberg atomic ensemble in the same blockade region embedded inside an optomechanical cavity can be regarded as a superatom that contains only a single Rydberg excitation. Therefore, the problem of exponentially increasing system size with the number of atoms increasing can be circumvented easily. The hybrid system becomes a coupling between a Rydberg superatom and an optomechanical cavity and the coupling strength is enhanced by a factor of square root of the number of atoms in the ensemble. In this system, the perfect OMIT, namely, an ideal OMIT dip with a very narrow window, can be attained when an effect of non-rotating wave approximation (NRWA) is considered. Further, we demonstrate that the term of NRWA plays a key important role in achieving perfect OMIT by comparing the optomechanical spectra obtained with and without NRWA effects. Our results show that in the resolved sideband regime the higher the quality factor of cavity is, the stronger the slow light effect becomes in the window of the perfect OMIT. Particularly, in achieving the ultraslow light, the long lifetime of the Rydberg atom shows its superiority.

SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB In this paper, a standard (3, 5)-threshold quantum secret sharing scheme is presented, in which any three of five participants can resume cooperatively the classical secret from the dealer, but one or two shares contain absolutely no information about the secret. Our scheme can be fulfilled by using the singular properties of maximally entangled 6-qubit states found by Borras. We analyze the scheme's security by several ways, for example, intercept-and-resend attack, entangle-and-measure attack, and so on. Compared with the other standard threshold quantum secret sharing schemes, our scheme needs neither to use d-level multipartite entangled states, nor to produce shares by classical secret splitting techniques, so it is feasible to be realized.

However, training VQAs faces difficulties, one of which is the so-called barren plateaus (BPs) phenomenon, where gradients of cost functions vanish exponentially with the number of qubits. In this paper, inspired by transfer learning, where knowledge of pre-solved tasks could be further used in a different but related work with training efficiency improved, we report a parameter initialization method to mitigate BP. In the method, a small-sized task is solved with a VQA. Then the ansatz and its optimum parameters are transferred to tasks with larger sizes. Numerical simulations show that this method could mitigate BP and improve training efficiency. A brief discussion on how this method can work well is also provided. This work provides a reference for mitigating BP, and therefore, VQAs could be applied to more practical problems.

AB With new quantum technologies and new applications comes a new need for specialists, the new quantum workforce. This brings new challenges for education that the typical quantum mechanics courses for physicists do not address. Requirements for the future quantum workforce need to be collected and training programmes created. In between, there should be a European competence framework on which to build the training programmes. One goal of the European Flagship project QTEdu is to develop this framework for second-generation quantum technologies. The Delphi study presented here serves as a basis for this: The aim is to identify knowledge and competences in the field of quantum information technologies, which are partly already needed in industry today, but especially in the future.

TI Noise-aware circuit compilations for a continuously parameterized
   two-qubit gateset
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW APPLIED
AB State-of-the-art noisy-intermediate-scale quantum processors are currently implemented across a variety of hardware platforms, each with their own distinct gatesets. As such, circuit compilation should not only be aware of but also deeply connect to the native gateset and noise properties of each. Trapped-ion processors are one such platform that provides a gateset that can be continuously parameterized across both one- and two-qubit gates. Here we use the Quantum Scientific Computing Open User Testbed to study noise-aware compilations focused on continuously parameterized two-qubit ZZ gates (based on the M & oslash;lmer-S & oslash;rensen interaction) using SUPERSTAQ, a quantum software platform for hardware-aware circuit compiler optimizations. We discuss the realization of ZZ gates with arbitrary angle on the all-to-all connected trapped-ion system. Then we discuss a variety of different compiler optimizations that innately target these ZZ gates and their noise properties. These optimizations include moving from a restricted maximally entangling gateset to a continuously parameterized one, swap mirroring to further reduce the total entangling angle of the operations, focusing the heaviest ZZ angle participation on the best-performing gate pairs, and circuit approximation to remove the least impactful ZZ gates. We demonstrate these compilation approaches on the hardware with randomized quantum volume circuits, observing the potential to realize a larger quantum volume as a result of these optimizations. Using differing yet complementary analysis techniques, we observe the distinct improvements in system performance provided by these noise-aware compilations and study the role of stochastic and coherent error channels for each compilation choice.

TI Bayesian optimization of non-classical optomechanical correlations
SO QUANTUM SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB Nonclassical correlations provide a resource for many applications in quantum technology as well as providing strong evidence that a system is indeed operating in the quantum regime. Optomechanical systems can be arranged to generate nonclassical correlations (such as quantum entanglement) between the mechanical mode and a mode of travelling light. Here we propose automated optimization of the production of quantum correlations in such a system, beyond what can be achieved through analytical methods, by applying Bayesian optimization to the control parameters. A two-mode optomechanical squeezing experiment is simulated using a detailed theoretical model of the system and the measurable outputs fed to the Bayesian optimization process. This then modifies the controllable parameters in order to maximize the non-classical two-mode squeezing and its detection, independently of the inner workings of the model. We focus on a levitated nano-sphere system, but the techniques described are broadly applicable in optomechanical experiments, and also more widely, especially where no detailed theoretical treatment is available. We find that in the experimentally relevant thermal regimes, the ability to vary and optimize a broad array of control parameters provides access to large values of two-mode squeezing that would otherwise be difficult or intractable to discover via analytical or trial and error methods. In particular we observe that modulation of the driving frequency around the resonant sideband allows for stronger nonclassical correlations. We also observe that our optimization approach finds parameters that allow significant squeezing in the high temperature regime. This extends the range of experimental setups in which non-classical correlations could be generated beyond the region of high quantum cooperativity.

TI Bursts of polarised single photons from atom-cavity sources
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICS B-ATOMIC MOLECULAR AND OPTICAL PHYSICS
AB Photonic qubits play an instrumental role in the development of advanced quantum technologies, including quantum networking, boson sampling and measurement based quantum computing. A promising framework for the deterministic production of indistinguishable single photons is an atomic emitter coupled to a single mode of a high finesse optical cavity. Polarisation control is an important cornerstone, particularly when the polarisation defines the state of a quantum bit. Here, we propose a scheme for producing bursts of polarised single photons by coupling a generalised atomic emitter to an optical cavity, exploiting a particular choice of quantisation axis. In connection with two re-preparation methods, simulations predict ten-photon bursts coincidence count rates on the order of 1 kHz with single 87Rb atoms trapped in a state of the art optical cavity. This paves the way for novel n-photon experiments with atom-cavity sources.

SO REVIEW OF SCIENTIFIC INSTRUMENTS
AB We develop a polarization characterization platform for optical devices in free-space quantum communications. We demonstrate an imaging polarimeter, which analyzes both incident polarization states and the angle of incidence, attached to a six-axis collaborative robot arm, enabling polarization characterization at any position and direction with consistent precision. We present a detailed description of each subsystem, including the calibration and polarization-test procedure, and analyze polarization measurement errors caused by imperfect orientations of the robot arm using a Mueller-matrix model of polarimeters at tilt incidence. We perform a proof-of-principle experiment for an angle-dependent polarization test for a commercial silver-coated mirror for which the polarization states of the reflected light can be accurately calculated. Quantitative agreement between the theory and experiment validates our methodology. We demonstrate the polarization test for a 20.3 cm lens designed for a quantum optical transmitter in Canada's Quantum Encryption and Science Satellite mission.

TI Signal Crosstalk in a Flip-Chip Quantum Processor
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB Quantum processors require a signal-delivery architecture with high addressability (low crosstalk) to ensure high performance already at the scale of dozens of qubits. Signal crosstalk causes inadvertent driving of quantum gates, which will adversely affect quantum gate fidelities in scaled-up devices. Here, we demonstrate packaged flip-chip superconducting quantum processors with signal-crosstalk performance competitive with those reported in other platforms. For capacitively coupled qubit-drive lines, we find on-resonant crosstalk better than -27 dB (average -37 dB). For inductively coupled magnetic-flux-drive lines, we find less than 0.13% direct-current flux crosstalk (average 0.05%). These observed crosstalk levels are adequately small and indicate a decreasing trend with increasing distance, which is promising for further scaling up to larger numbers of qubits. We discuss the implications of our results for the design of a low-crosstalk on-chip signal-delivery architecture, including the influence of a shielding tunnel structure, potential sources of crosstalk, and estimation of crosstalk-induced qubit-gate error in scaled-up quantum processors.

TI Forced carrier perturbation opens a loophole for chip-based continuous
   variable quantum key distribution system
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB The integration of the continous-variable quantum key distribution(CVQKD) system is an important technical route with great potential value for constructing high-performance and low-cost CVQKD system. In all previous CVQKD studies, the quantum efficiency of the detector can be calibrated in advance and is considered to remain unchanged. But when the size of the system shrinks to the on-chip level, especially in the premise of non-uniform waveguide, heavy doping and other factors, effects such as free carrier absorption and scattering loss will become prominent, which will directly cause carriers undergo violent migration due to the tiny jitter of the local oscillator and further lead to dynamical variation of quantum efficiency of detection. In this paper, we propose a practical chip-based detector model, and numerous simulation results based on this model show that the practical system will face potential security threats due to the variable quantum efficiency. Moreover, two defense strategies are proposed to solve these practical security problems commonly exist in general chip-based CVQKD systems. This work breaks the inherent viewpoint that the quantum efficiency in the chip-based CVQKD system can still be calibrated in advance, and suggests a more rigorous consideration of practical security for development of chip-based CVQKD.

TI Coherent control of an ultrabright single spin in hexagonal boron
   nitride at room temperature
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Optically active defects in hBN are promising for quantum sensing and information applications, however, coherent control of a single defect has not been achieved so far. By using an efficient method to produce arrays of defects in hBN, Guo et al. isolate a new carbon-related defect and show its coherent control.
   Hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) is a remarkable two-dimensional (2D) material that hosts solid-state spins and has great potential to be used in quantum information applications, including quantum networks. However, in this application, both the optical and spin properties are crucial for single spins but have not yet been discovered simultaneously for hBN spins. Here, we realize an efficient method for arraying and isolating the single defects of hBN and use this method to discover a new spin defect with a high probability of 85%. This single defect exhibits outstanding optical properties and an optically controllable spin, as indicated by the observed significant Rabi oscillation and Hahn echo experiments at room temperature. First principles calculations indicate that complexes of carbon and oxygen dopants may be the origin of the single spin defects. This provides a possibility for further addressing spins that can be optically controlled.

TI Beyond Shannon Limits: Quantum Communications Through Quantum Paths
SO IEEE JOURNAL ON SELECTED AREAS IN COMMUNICATIONS
AB A crucial step towards the 6th generation (6G) of networks would be a shift in communication paradigm beyond the limits of Shannon's theory. In both classical and quantum Shannon's information theory, communication channels are generally assumed to combine through classical trajectories, so that the associated network path traversed by the information carrier is well-defined. Counter-intuitively, quantum mechanics enables a quantum information carrier to propagate through a quantum path, i.e., through a path such that the causal order of the constituting communications channels becomes indefinite. Quantum paths exhibit astonishing features, such as providing non-null capacity even when no information can be sent through any classical path. In this paper, we study the quantum capacity achievable via a quantum path and establish upper and the lower bounds for it. Our findings reveal the substantial advantage achievable with a quantum path over any classical placements of communications channels in terms of ultimate achievable communication rates. Furthermore, we identify the region where a quantum path incontrovertibly outperforms the amount of transmissible information beyond the limits of conventional quantum Shannon's theory, and we quantify this advantage over classical paths through a conservative estimate.

TI A passive and self-characterizing cross-encoded receiver for
   reference-frame-independent quantum key distribution
SO OPTICA QUANTUM
AB Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) promises to revolutionize the field of security in communication, with applications ranging from state secrets to personal data, making it a key resource in the ongoing battle against cyber threats. Reference-Frame-Independent (RFI) QKD aims to simplify QKD implementations by allowing us to reduce the requirements of alignment on a shared reference frame. This is done by performing two mutually unbiased measurements on the control states. In this work, we present a practical realization of a fully passive receiver for time-bin-encoded RFI-QKD. Our proposed system employs a recently introduced Quantum Detector Self-Characterization technique to characterize the experimental defects of the physical implementation without executing tomographic studies on the detection stage. In fact, the security analysis carried out in this work uses experimentally retrieved Positive Operator Valued Measurements, which consider our receiver's defects, substituting the ideal expected operators and thus increasing the overall level of secrecy. Instead, the conversion of time-bin to polarization is employed to perform the required quantum measurement in a completely passive manner. Lastly, we conducted a proof-of-principle experiment that validated the feasibility of our method and its compliance with QKD applications.

TI Average concurrence and entanglement swapping
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB We study the role of average concurrence in entanglement swapping in quantum networks. We begin with qubit pure states, and there is a very simple rule governing the propagation of average concurrence in multiple swaps. We find a similarly simple rule for average concurrence when creating a Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger state from three entangled pairs. We look at examples of mixed qubit states and find that the relation for pure states gives an upper bound on what is possible with mixed states. We then move on to qudits, where we make use of the I-concurrence. Here the situation is not as simple as for qubits, but in some cases relatively straightforward results can be obtained.

TI Measurement-driven transitions between area law phases
SO PHYSICA SCRIPTA
AB In recent years, quantum circuits consisting of unitary gates and projective measurements have become valuable tools for stimulating or preparing quantum many-body states with non-trivial properties. Here, we introduce and examine a measurement-only circuit (the projective quantum Ising model with three-spin interactions) that involves three non-commuting projective measurements. This model features three distinct phases, separated by two critical lines. We utilize two entanglement measures (topological entanglement entropy and mutual information) to identify the phase boundaries and derive various critical exponents through scaling analysis. We establish a relationship between our model and a two-dimensional statistical model (bond percolation) within certain limits. We hope that our results will shed light on further studies using other measurement-only models.

TI Proposal of ensemble qubits with two-atom decay
SO NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB We propose and analyze a novel approach to implement ensemble qubits. The required anharmonicity is provided by a simultaneous decay of two atoms (i.e. two-atom decay), which is achieved by fully quantum degenerate parametric amplification. For an atomic ensemble, the two-atom decay generates and stabilizes a 2D quantum manifold, which is spanned by the ground and single-excited superradiant states. Moreover, this nonlinear decay process can strongly suppress transitions to higher-excited superradiant states, and convert residual transitions into an effective decay from the single-excitation superradiant state to the ground state. Our method does not require Rydberg dipole blockade and, thus, strong atom-atom interactions, compared to previous work. This indicates that it can be applied to typical atomic or spin ensembles in simple experimental setups. Remarkably, our idea is compatible with the cavity protection mechanism, and therefore spin dephasing due to inhomogeneous broadening can be strongly suppressed. The presented ensemble qubit provides a new platform for quantum information processing, and also extends the range of applications of atomic or spin ensembles.

TI Optimal verification of the Bell state and Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger
   states in untrusted quantum networks
SO NPJ QUANTUM INFORMATION
AB Bipartite and multipartite entangled states are basic ingredients for constructing quantum networks and their accurate verification is crucial to the functioning of the networks, especially for untrusted networks. Here we propose a simple approach for verifying the Bell state in an untrusted network in which one party is not honest. Only local projective measurements are required for the honest party. It turns out each verification protocol is tied to a probability distribution on the Bloch sphere and its performance has an intuitive geometric meaning. This geometric picture enables us to construct the optimal and simplest verification protocols, which are also very useful to detecting entanglement in the untrusted network. Moreover, we show that our verification protocols can achieve almost the same sample efficiencies as protocols tailored to standard quantum state verification. Furthermore, we establish an intimate connection between the verification of Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger states and the verification of the Bell state. By virtue of this connection we construct the optimal protocol for verifying Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger states and for detecting genuine multipartite entanglement.

TI Improving PV Resilience by Dynamic Reconfiguration in Distribution
   Grids: Problem Complexity and Computation Requirements
SO ENERGIES
AB The dissemination of low-carbon technologies, such as urban photovoltaic distributed generation, imposes new challenges to the operation of distribution grids. Distributed generation may introduce significant net-load asymmetries between feeders in the course of the day, resulting in higher losses. The dynamic reconfiguration of the grid could mitigate daily losses and be used to minimize or defer the need for network reinforcement. Yet, dynamic reconfiguration has to be carried out in near real-time in order to make use of the most updated load and generation forecast, this way maximizing operational benefits. Given the need to quickly find and update reconfiguration decisions, the computational complexity of the underlying optimal scheduling problem is studied in this paper. The problem is formulated and the impact of sub-optimal solutions is illustrated using a real medium-voltage distribution grid operated under a heavy generation scenario. The complexity of the scheduling problem is discussed to conclude that its optimal solution is infeasible in practical terms if relying upon classical computing. Quantum computing is finally proposed as a way to handle this kind of problem in the future.

TI Talking About Responsible Quantum: "Awareness Is the Absolute Minimum
   that horizontal ellipsis We Need to Do"
SO NANOETHICS
AB Hype over novel quantum technologies has prompted discussion on the likely societal impacts of the sector. Calls to ensure the responsible development of quantum technologies are complicated by a lack of concrete case studies or real-world examples of irresponsible quantum. At this stage, responsible quantum faces a situation reminiscent of the Collingridge dilemma. In this dilemma, the moment in which discussion on societal risks and benefits can be most impactful is also the time when the least information is available. The flipside of this challenge is an opportunity to build processes for examining the public good of quantum before the trajectory (and potential problems) of the sector become "locked in". Recent work in this space has argued that quantum researchers and innovators must work with society to address uncertainties and concerns. By engaging quantum stakeholders and understanding their perspectives on responsibility, this paper seeks to support this proposition and enable further dialogue on responsible development and use of quantum technologies.

TI Stable Symmetry-Protected Topological Phases in Systems with Heralded
   Noise
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB We present a family of local quantum channels whose steady states exhibit stable mixed-state symmetry-protected topological (SPT) order. Motivated by recent experimental progress on "erasure conversion" techniques that allow one to identify ( herald ) decoherence processes, we consider open systems with biased erasure noise, which leads to strongly symmetric heralded errors. We utilize this heralding to construct a local correction protocol that effectively confines errors into short-ranged pairs in the steady state. Using a combination of numerical simulations and mean-field analysis, we show that our protocol stabilizes SPT order against a sufficiently low rate of decoherence. As the rate of heralded noise increases, SPT order is eventually lost through a directed percolation transition. We further find that while introducing unheralded errors destroys SPT order in the limit of long length scales and timescales, the correction protocol is sufficient for ensuring that local SPT order persists, with a correlation length that diverges as xi similar to ( 1 - f e ) - 1 / 2 , where f e is the fraction of errors that are heralded.

TI Utilizing the multifrequency resonances of the electron spins in diamond
   nitrogen-vacancy centers under strong radio frequency driving for
   quantum sensing
SO JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYSICS
AB Multifrequency resonances in the pulsed-optically detected magnetic resonance (ODMR) spectra of electron spins in ensemble nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamonds are investigated under strong radio frequency (RF) driving at a MHz frequency range and weak microwave driving at a GHz frequency range in a bias static magnetic field for quantum sensing applications. First, we demonstrate that the coherent destruction of tunneling, which leads to the disappearance of the main resonance peaks, can be utilized for precise calibration of the RF amplitude. Next, we clarify the condition for enhancing the sensitivity of a DC magnetic field under strong RF driving at the RF frequency that matches the split frequency due to the hyperfine interaction between N-15 nuclear spins and the NV electron spins. Our findings indicate that strong RF driving increases the sensitivity of the DC magnetic field by enhancing the ODMR contrast and reducing the linewidth. The above results contribute to certifying the quantitative accuracy of RF imaging and enhancing the sensitivity of the DC magnetic field imaging using ensemble NV centers in diamonds.

TI Variational quantum simulation of the Fokker-Planck equation applied to
   quantum radiation reaction
SO JOURNAL OF PLASMA PHYSICS
AB Near-future experiments with Petawatt class lasers are expected to produce a high flux of gamma-ray photons and electron-positron pairs through strong field quantum electrodynamical processes. Simulations of the expected regime of laser-matter interaction are computationally intensive due to the disparity of the spatial and temporal scales, and because quantum and classical descriptions need to be accounted for simultaneously (classical for collective effects and quantum for nearly instantaneous events of hard photon emission and pair creation). We study the stochastic cooling of an electron beam in a strong, constant, uniform magnetic field, both its particle distribution functions and their energy momenta. We start by obtaining approximate closed-form analytical solutions to the relevant observables. Then, we apply the quantum-hybrid variational quantum imaginary time evolution to the Fokker-Planck equation describing this process and compare it against theory and results from particle-in-cell simulations and classical partial differential equation solvers, showing good agreement. This work will be useful as a first step towards quantum simulation of plasma physics scenarios where diffusion processes are important, particularly in strong electromagnetic fields.

TI Experimental study of quantum uncertainty from lack of information
SO NPJ QUANTUM INFORMATION
AB Quantum uncertainty is a well-known property of quantum mechanics that states the impossibility of predicting measurement outcomes of multiple incompatible observables simultaneously. In contrast, the uncertainty in the classical domain comes from the lack of information about the exact state of the system. One may naturally ask, whether the quantum uncertainty is indeed a fully intrinsic property of the quantum theory, or whether similar to the classical domain lack of knowledge about specific parts of the physical system might be the source of this uncertainty. This question has been addressed in the previous literature where the authors argue that in the entropic formulation of the uncertainty principle that can be illustrated using the so-called, guessing games, indeed such lack of information has a significant contribution to the arising quantum uncertainty. Here we investigate this issue experimentally by implementing the corresponding two-dimensional and three-dimensional guessing games. Our results confirm that within the guessing-game framework, the quantum uncertainty to a large extent relies on the fact that quantum information determining the key properties of the game is stored in the degrees of freedom that remain inaccessible to the guessing party. Moreover, we offer an experimentally compact method to construct the high-dimensional Fourier gate which is a major building block for various tasks in quantum computation, quantum communication, and quantum metrology.

   of fermionic Hamiltonians to linear combination of unitaries
SO QUANTUM SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB Linear combination of unitaries (LCU) decompositions have become a key tool for encoding operators on quantum computers, enabling efficient implementations of arbitrary operators. In particular, LCU methods provide a way to encode the electronic structure Hamiltonian into quantum circuits. Over the years, various decomposition techniques have been developed for this purpose. Here, we introduce the Majorana tensor decomposition, a framework that unifies existing LCU approaches and introduces novel decompositions using low-rank tensor factorizations. We benchmark a range of decomposition techniques on small molecular systems and hydrogen chains of increasing sizes, evaluating their performance across different LCU methods.

TI Quantum secure direct communication in Internet of Vehicles
SO ISCIENCE
AB The Internet of Vehicles (IoVs) is one of the most popular techniques among the applications of Internet of Things. The existing IoVs are mainly protected by public key cryptographic systems, which provide identity authentication and information security. Nevertheless, using the proposed Shor's algorithm, the security of all classical cryptographic schemes will be exposed to future quantum computer technologies. Fortunately, based on the unconditional security property of quantum mechanics, direct communication protocols can resist quantum computer attacks and deliver secret messages directly without the requirement of pre-shared keys. For IoV networks, we present a continuous-variable quantum secure direct communication (CV-QSDC) protocol in which the orbital angular momentum (OAM) is used as the information carrier. For one thing, the field of continuous-variable quantum communication system is compatible with the standard telecommunication technology; for another, orbital angular momentum eigenstates for coding possess higher information capacity.

TI XENet: Using a new graph convolution to accelerate the timeline for
   protein design on quantum computers
SO PLOS COMPUTATIONAL BIOLOGY
AB Graph representations are traditionally used to represent protein structures in sequence design protocols in which the protein backbone conformation is known. This infrequently extends to machine learning projects: existing graph convolution algorithms have shortcomings when representing protein environments. One reason for this is the lack of emphasis on edge attributes during massage-passing operations. Another reason is the traditionally shallow nature of graph neural network architectures. Here we introduce an improved message-passing operation that is better equipped to model local kinematics problems such as protein design. Our approach, XENet, pays special attention to both incoming and outgoing edge attributes. We compare XENet against existing graph convolutions in an attempt to decrease rotamer sample counts in Rosetta's rotamer substitution protocol, used for protein side-chain optimization and sequence design. This use case is motivating because it both reduces the size of the search space for classical side-chain optimization algorithms, and allows larger protein design problems to be solved with quantum algorithms on near-term quantum computers with limited qubit counts. XENet outperformed competing models while also displaying a greater tolerance for deeper architectures. We found that XENet was able to decrease rotamer counts by 40% without loss in quality. This decreased the memory consumption for classical pre-computation of rotamer energies in our use case by more than a factor of 3, the qubit consumption for an existing sequence design quantum algorithm by 40%, and the size of the solution space by a factor of 165. Additionally, XENet displayed an ability to handle deeper architectures than competing convolutions.

This paper introduces three semi-quantum summation protocols based on single photons, where eliminating the need for classical users to possess measurement capabilities. Two-party protocol 1 and protocol 2 are structured upon different models: star and ring, respectively. The security analysis extensively evaluates the protocols' resilience against outside and inside attacks, demonstrating protocols are asymptotically secure. Protocol 3 extends two-party protocol 1 to multi-party scenarios, broadening its applicability. Comparison reveals a reduction in the workload for classical users compared to previous similar protocols, and the protocols' correctness are visually validated through simulation by Qiskit.

TI Entanglement-enhanced quantum rectification
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Quantum mechanics dictates the band structure of materials that is essential for functional electronic components. With increased miniaturization of devices, it becomes possible to exploit the full potential of quantum mechanics through the principles of superposition and entanglement. We propose a class of quantum rectifiers that can leverage entanglement to dramatically increase performance by coupling two small spin chains through an effective double-slit interface. Simulations show that rectification is enhanced by several orders of magnitude even in small systems, and that the effect survives in a noisy environment. Realizable using several of the quantum technology platforms currently available, our findings reveal the importance of quantum entanglement in seemingly contradictory applications such as heat and noise control.

TI Continuous-variable quantum key distribution coexisting with classical
   signals on few-mode fiber
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB Continuous-variable quantum key distribution (CVQKD) holds an advantage of well compatibility with classical coherent optical communications. However, there exists a performance trade-off between CVQKD and classical communication on single-mode fiber (SMF) because of the spontaneous Raman scattering. Space-division multiplexing (SDM) technique may provide a feasible way to mitigate this performance trade-off in short-distance communication while CVQKD coexisting with classical signals on few-mode fiber (FMF). Here, we examine the feasibility of CVQKD coexisting with classical signals on FMF and analyze the noise impact in weak coupling regime. We find that the inter-mode crosstalk generated from the mode coupling and re-coupling between modes and the group delay spread originated from the differential group delay (DGD) contribute the main noise sources. DGD may become one of the main limits for FMF-based CVQKD towards high-speed system. In addition, a well channel wavelength management is needed to suppress the inter-mode four-wave-mixing for achieving the positive secret key rates. The numerical simulations identify the key parameters for CVQKD system, enabling a helpful insight for realizing security analysis of the Gaussian modulated coherent state protocol. It shows that CVQKD coexisting with high power classical signals on FMF is feasible to implement with standard telecommunication components and able to operate at higher secret key rates. The results may provide a potential guideline for the practical high-rate CVQKD integrating with the FMF-based configuration.

To address the phase mismatch between independently operated lasers at the transmitter and receiver, this work proposes a multi-pilot scheme integrated with advanced digital filtering for optimized phase estimation. Through systematic comparisons of the rectangular filter, Savitzky-Golay filter, and Wiener filter, experimental results confirm that Wiener filtering has superior noise suppression capabilities based on multiple frequency pilot-tones. Implemented under the Gaussian-modulated coherent state (GMCS) protocol, our findings reveal that dual-pilot, four-pilot, and eight-pilot configurations all enhance phase recovery precision compared to single-pilot approaches, with the dual-pilot scheme achieving optimal balance between system complexity and performance. In a 20 km fiber link with a 1 GHz system repetition rate and a 2.83 SNU modulation variance, the dual-pilot Wiener-filtered configuration achieves an asymptotic secret key rate of almost 80 Mbps, establishing an innovative approach for practical LLO-CVQKD phase recovery.

TI Kolmogorov-Arnold-Moser Stability for Conserved Quantities in
   Finite-Dimensional Quantum Systems
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB We show that for any finite-dimensional quantum systems the conserved quantities can be characterized by their robustness to small perturbations: for fragile symmetries, small perturbations can lead to large deviations over long times, while for robust symmetries, their expectation values remain close to their initial values for all times. This is in analogy with the celebrated Kolmogorov-Arnold-Moser theorem in classical mechanics. To prove this result, we introduce a resummation of a perturbation series, which generalizes the Hamiltonian of the quantum Zeno dynamics.

TI Imaging ferroelectric domains with a single-spin scanning quantum sensor
SO NATURE PHYSICS
AB The ability to sensitively image electric fields is important for understanding many nanoelectronic phenomena, including charge accumulation at surfaces(1) and interfaces(2) and field distributions in active electronic devices(3). A particularly exciting application is the visualization of domain patterns in ferroelectric and nanoferroic materials(4,5), owing to their potential in computing and data storage(6-8). Here, we use a scanning nitrogen-vacancy (NV) microscope, well known for its use in magnetometry(9), to image domain patterns in piezoelectric (Pb[Zr0.2Ti0.8]O-3) and improper ferroelectric (YMnO3) materials through their electric fields. Electric field detection is enabled by measuring the Stark shift of the NV spin(10,11) using a gradiometric detection scheme(12). Analysis of the electric field maps allows us to discriminate between different types of surface charge distributions, as well as to reconstruct maps of the three-dimensional electric field vector and charge density. The ability to measure both stray electric and magnetic fields(9,13) under ambient conditions opens opportunities for the study of multiferroic and multifunctional materials and devices(8,14).

TI Antisite defect qubits in monolayer transition metal dichalcogenides
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Two-dimensional materials offer a promising platform for scalable solid-state spin qubit. Here, using high-throughput ab initio simulations, the authors identify suitable defect centers in monolayer group-VI transition metal dichalcogenides and assess their potential as qubits.
   Being atomically thin and amenable to external controls, two-dimensional (2D) materials offer a new paradigm for the realization of patterned qubit fabrication and operation at room temperature for quantum information sciences applications. Here we show that the antisite defect in 2D transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) can provide a controllable solid-state spin qubit system. Using high-throughput atomistic simulations, we identify several neutral antisite defects in TMDs that lie deep in the bulk band gap and host a paramagnetic triplet ground state. Our in-depth analysis reveals the presence of optical transitions and triplet-singlet intersystem crossing processes for fingerprinting these defect qubits. As an illustrative example, we discuss the initialization and readout principles of an antisite qubit in WS2, which is expected to be stable against interlayer interactions in a multilayer structure for qubit isolation and protection in future qubit-based devices. Our study opens a new pathway for creating scalable, room-temperature spin qubits in 2D TMDs.

TI Optimal single-shot discrimination of optical modes
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Retrieving classical information encoded in optical modes is at the heart of many quantum information processing tasks, especially in the field of quantum communication and sensing. Yet, despite its importance, the fundamental limits of optical mode discrimination have been studied only in a few specific examples. Here we present a toolbox to find the optimal discrimination of any set of optical modes. The toolbox uses linear and semidefinite programming techniques, which provide rigorous (not heuristic) bounds, and which can be efficiently solved on standard computers. We study both probabilistic and unambiguous single-shot discrimination in two scenarios: the channel-discrimination scenario, typical of metrology, in which the verifier holds the light source and can set up a reference frame for the phase; and the source-discrimination scenario, more frequent in cryptography, in which the verifier only sees states that are diagonal in the photon-number basis. Our techniques are illustrated with several examples. Among the results, we find that, for many sets of modes, the optimal state for mode discrimination is a superposition or mixture of at most two number states; but this is not general, and we also exhibit counterexamples.

TI Kramers-Protected Hardware-Efficient Error Correction with Andreev Spin
   Qubits
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB We propose an architecture for bit-flip error correction of Andreev spins that is protected by Kramers' degeneracy. Specifically, we show that a coupling network of linear inductors and Andreev spin qubits results in a static Hamiltonian composed of the stabilizers of a bit-flip code. The electrodynamics of the many-body spin states also respect these stabilizers, and we show how reflectometry off a single coupled resonator can thereby accomplish their projective measurement. We further show how circuit-mediated spin couplings enable error correction operations and a complete set of single-and two-module logical quantum gates. The concept, which we dub the "Ising molecule qubit," is experimentally feasible and provides a path for compact noise-biased qubits.

TI Differential equation-driven intelligent control: Integrating AI,
   Quantum computing, and adaptive strategies for next-generation
   industrial automation
SO ADVANCES IN DIFFERENTIAL EQUATIONS AND CONTROL PROCESSES
AB The increasing intricacy of industrial systems highlights the inadequacies of conventional control theories in the management of high-dimensional nonlinear dynamics, real-time coupling, and multi-scale modelling. This article introduces a transformative paradigm-differential equation-driven intelligent control-that synergizes artificial intelligence (AI), quantum computing, and adaptive strategies to redefine next-generation industrial automation. The following innovations are at the core of this paradigm: Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) for solving partial differential equations (PDEs), Quantum-enhanced linear algebra for stochastic differential equation (SDE) optimization, and symbolic regression for automated discovery of fractional-order dynamic models. A case study on flexible robotic arm dynamics demonstrates the tunability of hybrid rigid-flexible systems via fractional-order parameters and adaptive Lyapunov-based control. The concept of Equations as a Service (EaaS) is proposed to democratize access to distributed computational solvers, enabling real-time optimization for applications such as drone swarm coordination and carbon-neutral manufacturing. A number of critical challenges are addressed in this text, including the interpretability of AI (for example, through the use of SHAP-based explainability tools), the reliability of hybrid quantum-classical solvers, and ethical governance frameworks. Through interdisciplinary collaboration, the vision for self-evolving factories by 2030 is outlined- where differential equations autonomously refine parameters using real-time sensor data. Examples include smart grids adapting to renewable energy fluctuations at millisecond scales and robotic assembly lines recalibrating dynamics to mitigate material defects. The overarching objective of this paradigm shift, termed EaaS, is to transition differential equations from their traditional role as static descriptors to that of self-optimizing assets. This transition is expected to lay the foundation for resilient, explainable, and sustainable ecosystems in the era of Industry 5.0.

TI Shaking Up Quantum Simulators with Fuzzing and Rigour
SO PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACM ON PROGRAMMING LANGUAGES-PACMPL
AB Quantum computing platforms rely on simulators for modelling circuit behaviour prior to hardware execution, where inconsistencies can lead to costly errors. While existing formal validation methods typically target specific compiler components to manage state explosion, they often miss critical bugs. Meanwhile, conventional testing lacks systematic exploration of corner cases and realistic execution scenarios, resulting in both false positives and negatives. We present FuzzQ, a novel framework that bridges this gap by combining formal methods with structured test generation and fuzzing for quantum simulators. Our approach employs differential benchmarking complemented by mutation testing and invariant checking. At its core, FuzzQ utilises our Alloy-based formal model of QASM 3.0, which encodes the semantics of quantum circuits to enable automated analysis and to generate structurally diverse, constraint-guided quantum circuits with guaranteed properties. We introduce several test oracles to assess both Alloy's modelling of QASM 3.0 and simulator correctness, including invariant-based checks, statistical distribution tests, and a novel cross-simulator unitary consistency check that verifies functional equivalence modulo global phase, revealing discrepancies that standard statevector comparisons fail to detect in cross-platform differential testing. We evaluate FuzzQ on both Qiskit and Cirq, demonstrating its platform-agnostic effectiveness. By executing over 800,000 quantum circuits to completion, we assess throughput, code and circuit coverage, and simulator performance metrics, including sensitivity, correctness, and memory overhead. Our analysis revealed eight simulator bugs, six previously undocumented. We also outline a path for extending the framework to support mixed-state simulations under realistic noise models.

TI Multiphoton-dressed Rydberg excitations in a microwave cavity with
   ultracold Rb atoms
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB We investigate magneto-optical trap-loss spectroscopy of Rydberg excited 85Rb (66 n 68 S1/2) atoms, placed inside a tailored microwave cavity. The cavity frequency at 13.053 GHz is in resonance with the 67S1/2 -* 66P3/2 transition, inducing a ladder multiphoton microwave Rydberg absorption and emission. The observed spectra are modeled with an extended Jaynes-Cummings formalism that accounts for nonlinear multiphoton absorption from and emission into the cavity, the loss from the trap due to Rydberg excitation, and cavity imperfection. We calculate the average photons in each spectral feature and find evidence for fractional photon emission into the cavity modes within the loss spectra. The microwave cavity Rydberg spectroscopy in this work provides key insights for advancing Rydberg-based sensors, quantum gates in hybrid systems, and the broader development of quantum technologies.

TI Classification of knee osteoarthritis based on quantum-to-classical
   transfer learning
SO FRONTIERS IN PHYSICS
AB Quantum machine learning takes advantage of features such as quantum computing superposition and entanglement to enable better performance of machine learning models. In this paper, we first propose an improved hybrid quantum convolutional neural network (HQCNN) model. The HQCNN model was used to pre-train brain tumor dataset (MRI) images. Next, the quantum classical transfer learning (QCTL) approach is used to fine-tune and extract features based on pre-trained weights. A hybrid quantum convolutional network structure was used to test the osteoarthritis of the knee dataset (OAI) and to quantitatively evaluate standard metrics to verify the robustness of the classifier. The final experimental results show that the QCTL method can effectively classify knee osteoarthritis with a classification accuracy of 98.36%. The quantum-to-classical transfer learning method improves classification accuracy by 1.08%. How to use different coding techniques in HQCNN models applied to medical image analysis is also a future research direction.

TI Impact of homodyne receiver bandwidth and signal modulation patterns on
   the continuous-variable quantum key distribution
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB In continuous-variable quantum key distribution (CV-QKD), the key information are encoded on quadratures of the optical field, which are measured via balanced homodyne detector (BHD). The bandwidth of the BHD is one of key parameters for precise characterization of quantum states. We establish a theoretical model to analyze the impact of the BHD bandwidth and signal modulation patterns on the channel parameters estimation of CV-QKD systems. Based on the proposed model, the secure key rate of a practical CV-QKD system under different BHD bandwidths and signal modulation patterns are investigated. Our results show that insufficient BHD bandwidth will result in wrong estimate of the transmission loss and excess noise, which significantly affects the performance of CV-QKD systems. Given the BHD bandwidth, there exists an optimal signal repetition rate that maximizes the secure key rate. The BHD bandwidth requirement of the QKD system increases with the transmission distance for large duty cycle pulse. Furthermore, the root raised-cosine pulse signal modulation performs better than the square pulse signal modulation in general.

TI Multi-Objective Routing Optimization for 6G Communication Networks Using

SO SENSORS
AB Sixth-generation wireless (6G) technology has been focused on in the wireless research community. Global coverage, massive spectrum usage, complex new applications, and strong security are among the new paradigms introduced by 6G. However, realizing such features may require computation capabilities transcending those of present (classical) computers. Large technology companies are already exploring quantum computers, which could be adopted as potential technological enablers for 6G. This is a promising avenue to explore because quantum computers exploit the properties of quantum states to perform certain computations significantly faster than classical computers. This paper focuses on routing optimization in wireless mesh networks using quantum computers, explicitly applying the quantum approximate optimization algorithm (QAOA). Single-objective and multi-objective examples are presented as robust candidates for the application of quantum machine learning. Moreover, a discussion about quantum supremacy estimation for this problem is provided.

TI A weighted quantum ensemble of homogeneous quantum classifiers
SO QUANTUM MACHINE INTELLIGENCE
AB Ensemble methods in machine learning aim to improve prediction accuracy by combining multiple models. This is achieved by ensuring diversity among predictors to capture different data aspects. Homogeneous ensembles use identical models, achieving diversity through different data subsets, and weighted-average ensembles assign higher influence to more accurate models through a weight learning procedure. We propose a method to achieve a weighted homogeneous quantum ensemble using quantum classifiers with indexing registers for data encoding. This approach leverages instance-based quantum classifiers, enabling feature and training point subsampling through superposition and controlled unitaries, and allowing for a quantum-parallel execution of diverse internal classifiers with different data compositions in superposition. The method integrates a learning process involving circuit execution and classical weight optimization, for a trained ensemble execution with weights encoded in the circuit at test-time. Empirical evaluation demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, offering insights into its performance.

TI Efficient solution of the number partitioning problem on a quantum
   annealer: a hybrid quantum-classical decomposition approach
SO JOURNAL OF HEURISTICS
AB Current quantum computers can only solve optimization problems of a very limited size. For larger problems, decomposition methods are required in which the original problem is broken down into several smaller sub-problems. These are then solved on the quantum computer and their solutions are recombined into a final solution for the original problem. Often, these decomposition methods do not take the specific problem structure into account. In this paper, we present a tailored method using a divide-and-conquer strategy to solve the 2-way Number partitioning problem (NPP) with a large number of variables. The idea is to perform a specialized decomposition into smaller NPPs, which are solved on a quantum computer, and then recombine the results into another small auxiliary NPP. Solving this auxiliary problem yields an approximate solution of the original larger problem. We experimentally verify that our method allows to solve NPPs with over a thousand variables using the D-Wave Advantage quantum annealer (Advantage_system6.4).

TI Testing symmetry on quantum computers
SO QUANTUM
AB Symmetry is a unifying concept in physics. In quantum information and beyond, it is known that quantum states possessing symmetry are not useful for certain information-processing tasks. For example, states that commute with a Hamiltonian realizing a time evolution are not useful for timekeeping during that evolution, and bipartite states that are highly extendible are not strongly entangled and thus not useful for basic tasks like teleportation. Motivated by this perspective, this paper details several quantum algorithms that test the symmetry of quantum states and channels. For the case of testing Bose symmetry of a state, we show that there is a simple and efficient quantum algorithm, while the tests for other kinds of symmetry rely on the aid of a quantum prover. We prove that the acceptance probability of each algorithm is equal to the maximum symmetric fidelity of the state being tested, thus giving a firm operational meaning to these latter resource quantifiers. Special cases of the algorithms test for incoherence or separability of quantum states. We evaluate the performance of these algorithms on choice examples by using the variational approach to quantum algorithms, replacing the quantum prover with a parameterized circuit. We demonstrate this approach for numerous examples using the IBM quantum noiseless and noisy simulators, and we observe that the algorithms perform well in the noiseless case and exhibit noise resilience in the noisy case. We also show that the maximum symmetric fidelities can be calculated by semi-definite programs, which is useful for benchmarking the performance of these algorithms for sufficiently small examples. Finally, we establish various generalizations of the resource theory of asymmetry, with the upshot being that the acceptance probabilities of the algorithms are resource monotones and thus well motivated from the resource-theoretic perspective.

TI Geometric visualizations of single and entangled qubits
SO AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB The Bloch Sphere visualization of the possible states of a single qubit serves as a useful pedagogical and conceptual tool, offering a one-to-one map between qubit states and points in a 3D space. However, understanding many important concepts of quantum mechanics, such as entanglement, requires developing intuitions about states with a minimum of two qubits, which map one-to-one to unvisualizable spaces of six dimensions and higher. In this paper, we circumvent this visualization issue by creating maps of subspaces of 1- and 2-qubit systems that quantitatively and qualitatively encode properties of these states in their geometries. For the 1-qubit case, the subspace approach allows one to visualize how mixed states relate to different choices of measurement in a basis-independent way and how to read off the entries in a density matrix representation of these states from lengths in a simple diagram. For the 2-qubit case, a toroidal map of 2-qubit states illuminates the non-trivial topology of the state space while allowing one to simultaneously read off, in distances and angles, the level of entanglement in the 2-qubit state and the mixed-state properties of its constituent qubits. By encoding states and their evolutions through quantum logic gates with little to no need of mathematical formalism, these maps may prove particularly useful for understanding fundamental concepts of quantum mechanics and quantum information at the introductory level.

TI GeQuPI: : Quantum Program Improvement with Multi-Objective Genetic
   Programming☆
SO JOURNAL OF SYSTEMS AND SOFTWARE
AB Processing quantum information poses novel challenges regarding the debugging of faulty quantum programs. Notably, the lack of accessible information on intermediate states during quantum processing, renders traditional debugging techniques infeasible. Moreover, even correct quantum programs might not be processable, as current quantum computers are limited in computation capacity. Thus, quantum program developers have to consider trade-offs between accuracy (i.e., probabilistically correct functionality) and computational cost of the proposed solutions. Manually finding sufficiently accurate and efficient solutions is a challenging task, even for quantum computing experts. To tackle these challenges, we propose a quantum program improvement framework for an automated generation of accurate and efficient solutions, coined Genetic Quantum Program Improver (GeQuPI). In particular, we focus on the tasks of debugging and optimization of quantum programs. Our framework uses techniques from quantum information theory and applies multi-objective genetic programming, which can be further hybridized with quantum-aware optimizers. To demonstrate the benefits of GeQuPI, it is applied to 47 quantum programs reused from literature and openly published libraries. The results show that our approach is capable of correcting faulty programs and optimize inefficient ones for the majority of the studied cases, showing average optimizations of 35% with respect to computational cost.

TI Quantum computing of the 6Li nucleus via ordered unitary coupled
   clusters
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW C
AB The variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) is an algorithm to compute ground and excited state energy of quantum many-body systems. A key component of the algorithm and an active research area is the construction of a parametrized trial wave function-a so-called variational ansatz. The wave function parametrization should be expressive enough, i.e., represent the true eigenstate of a quantum system for some choice of parameter values. On the other hand, it should be trainable, i.e., the number of parameters should not grow exponentially with the size of the system. Here, we apply VQE to the problem of finding ground and excited state energies of the odd-odd nucleus 6Li. We study the effects of ordering fermionic excitation operators in the unitary coupled clusters ansatz on the VQE algorithm convergence by using only operators preserving the Jz quantum number. The accuracy is improved by two orders of magnitude in the case of descending order. We first compute optimal ansatz parameter values using a classical state-vector simulator with arbitrary measurement accuracy and then use those values to evaluate energy eigenstates of 6Li on a superconducting quantum chip from IBM. We postprocess the results by using error mitigation techniques and are able to reproduce the exact energy with an error of 3.8% and 0.1% for the ground state and for the first excited state of 6Li, respectively.

TI Giant optical polarisation rotations induced by a single quantum dot
   spin
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB In the framework of optical quantum computing and communications, a major objective consists in building receiving nodes implementing conditional operations on incoming photons, using a single stationary qubit. In particular, the quest for scalable nodes motivated the development of cavity-enhanced spin-photon interfaces with solid-state emitters. An important challenge remains, however, to produce a stable, controllable, spin-dependent photon state, in a deterministic way. Here we use an electrically-contacted pillar-based cavity, embedding a single InGaAs quantum dot, to demonstrate giant polarisation rotations induced on reflected photons by a single electron spin. A complete tomography approach is introduced to extrapolate the output polarisation Stokes vector, conditioned by a specific spin state, in presence of spin and charge fluctuations. We experimentally approach polarisation states conditionally rotated by pi/2 , pi, and -pi/2 in the Poincare sphere with extrapolated fidelities of (97 +/- 1) %, (84 +/- 7) %, and (90 +/- 8) %, respectively. We find that an enhanced light-matter coupling, together with limited cavity birefringence and reduced spectral fluctuations, allow targeting most conditional rotations in the Poincare sphere, with a control both in longitude and latitude. Such polarisation control may prove crucial to adapt spin-photon interfaces to various configurations and protocols for quantum information.

TI Classification of dynamical Lie algebras of 2-local spin systems on
   linear, circular and fully connected topologies
SO NPJ QUANTUM INFORMATION
AB Much is understood about 1-dimensional spin chains in terms of entanglement properties, physical phases, and integrability. However, the Lie algebraic properties of the Hamiltonians describing these systems remain largely unexplored. In this work, we provide a classification of all Lie algebras generated by the terms of 2-local spin chain Hamiltonians, or so-called dynamical Lie algebras, on 1-dimensional linear and circular lattice structures. We find 17 unique dynamical Lie algebras. Our classification includes some well-known models such as the transverse-field Ising model and the Heisenberg chain, and we also find more exotic classes of Hamiltonians that appear new. In addition to the closed and open spin chains, we consider systems with a fully connected topology, which may be relevant for quantum machine learning approaches. We discuss the practical implications of our work in the context of variational quantum computing, quantum control and the spin chain literature.

TI Demonstration of a non-Abelian geometric controlled-NOT gate in a
   superconducting circuit
SO OPTICA
AB Holonomies, arising from non-Abelian geometric transformations of quantum states in Hilbert space, offer a promising way for quantum computation. These holonomies are not commutable and thus can be used for the realization of a universal set of quantum logic gates, where the global geometric feature may result in some noise-resilient advantages. Here we report, to our knowledge, the first on-chip realization of a non-Abelian geometric controlled-NOT gate in a superconducting circuit, which is a building block for constructing a holonomic quantum computer. The conditional dynamics is achieved in an all-to-all connected architecture involving multiple frequency-tunable superconducting qubits controllably coupled to a resonator; a holonomic gate between any two qubits can be implemented by tuning their frequencies on-resonance with the resonator and applying a two-tone drive to one of them. This gate represents an important step towards the all-geometric realization of scalable quantum computation on a superconducting platform.

TI Quantum MAC: Genuine Entanglement Access Control via Many-Body Dicke
   States
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON COMMUNICATIONS
AB Multipartite entanglement plays a crucial role for the design of the Quantum Internet, due to its peculiarities with no classical counterpart. Yet, for entanglement-based quantum networks, a key open issue is constituted by the lack of an effective entanglement access control (EAC) strategy for properly handling and coordinating the quantum nodes in accessing the entangled resource. In this paper, we design a quantum-genuine entanglement access control (EAC) to solve the contention problem arising in accessing a multipartite entangled resource. The proposed quantum-genuine EAC is able to: i) fairly select a subset of nodes granted with the access to the contended resource; ii) preserve the privacy and anonymity of the identities of the selected nodes; iii) avoid to delegate the signaling arising with entanglement access control to the classical network. We also conduct a theoretical analysis of noise effects on the proposed EAC. This theoretical analysis is able to catch the complex noise effects on the EAC through meaningful parameters.

TI Quantum Key Distribution Protocol Selector Based on Machine Learning for
   Next-Generation Networks
SO SUSTAINABILITY
AB In next-generation networks, including the sixth generation (6G), a large number of computing devices can communicate with ultra-low latency. By implication, 6G capabilities present a massive benefit for the Internet of Things (IoT), considering a wide range of application domains. However, some security concerns in the IoT involving authentication and encryption protocols are currently under investigation. Thus, mechanisms implementing quantum communications in IoT devices have been explored to offer improved security. Algorithmic solutions that enable better quantum key distribution (QKD) selection for authentication and encryption have been developed, but having limited performance considering time requirements. Therefore, a new approach for selecting the best QKD protocol based on a Deep Convolutional Neural Network model, called Tree-CNN, is proposed using the Tanh Exponential Activation Function (TanhExp) that enables IoT devices to handle more secure quantum communications using the 6G network infrastructure. The proposed model is developed, and its performance is compared with classical Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and other machine learning methods. The results obtained are superior to the related works, with an Area Under the Curve (AUC) of 99.89% during testing and a time-cost performance of 0.65 s for predicting the best QKD protocol. In addition, we tested our proposal using different transmission distances and three QKD protocols to demonstrate that the prediction and actual results reached similar values. Hence, our proposed model obtained a fast, reliable, and precise solution to solve the challenges of performance and time consumption in selecting the best QKD protocol.

TI Bilocal Bell Inequalities Violated by the Quantum Elegant Joint
   Measurement
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB Network Bell experiments give rise to a form of quantum nonlocality that conceptually goes beyond Bell's theorem. We investigate here the simplest network, known as the bilocality scenario. We depart from the typical use of the Bell state measurement in the network central node and instead introduce a family of symmetric isoentangled measurement bases that generalize the so-called "elegant joint measurement." This leads us to report noise-tolerant quantum correlations that elude bilocal variable models. Inspired by these quantum correlations, we introduce network Bell inequalities for the bilocality scenario and show that they admit noise-tolerant quantum violations. In contrast to many previous studies of network Bell inequalities, neither our inequalities nor their quantum violations are based on standard Bell inequalities and standard quantum nonlocality. Moreover, we pave the way for an experimental realization by presenting a simple two-qubit quantum circuit for the implementation of the elegant joint measurement and our generalization.

AB Grover's algorithm offers a celebrated quadratic speedup for unstructured search problems, positioning it among the foundational tools of quantum computing. However, its effectiveness critically deteriorates when the number of valid solutions exceeds half of the total search space. In this work, we address this limitation by introducing a novel and efficient technique based on a virtual expansion of the input domain. Our approach extends the range of applicability of Grover's algorithm to high-density solution spaces, including those where the number of solutions is greater than N/2, without increasing the actual circuit depth or memory footprint. The core idea consists in appending one auxiliary qubit to the input register and modifying the oracle to mark only those solutions where the auxiliary qubit is in a fixed state. This effectively reduces the solution density in the extended space, restoring the geometric conditions required for successful amplitude amplification. We further analyze an extension of this strategy involving log.. auxiliary qubits, which allows for tunable robustness at a moderate increase in computational cost. The proposed method is simple to implement on existing quantum hardware and maintains Grover's optimal asymptotic complexity in the expanded regime. Both theoretical analysis and empirical simulations confirm that our approach reliably outperforms the standard algorithm in scenarios with high solution density, thus broadening the practical utility of quantum search.

TI Moderate Deviation Expansion for Fully Quantum Tasks
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INFORMATION THEORY
AB The moderate deviation regime is concerned with the finite block length trade-off between communication cost and error for information processing tasks in the asymptotic regime, where the communication cost approaches a capacity-like quantity and the error vanishes at the same time. We find exact characterisations of these trade-offs for a variety of fully quantum communication tasks, including quantum source coding, quantum state splitting, entanglement-assisted quantum channel coding, and entanglement-assisted quantum channel simulation. The main technical tool we derive is a tight relation between the partially smoothed max-information and the hypothesis testing relative entropy. This allows us to obtain the expansion of the partially smoothed max-information for i.i.d. states in the moderate deviation regime.

TI Computational capabilities and compiler development for neutral atom
   quantum processors-connecting tool developers and hardware experts
SO QUANTUM SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB Neutral Atom Quantum Computing (NAQC) emerges as a promising hardware platform primarily due to its long coherence times and scalability. Additionally, NAQC offers computational advantages encompassing potential long-range connectivity, native multi-qubit gate support, and the ability to physically rearrange qubits with high fidelity. However, for the successful operation of a NAQC processor, one additionally requires new software tools to translate high-level algorithmic descriptions into a hardware executable representation, taking maximal advantage of the hardware capabilities. Realizing new software tools requires a close connection between tool developers and hardware experts to ensure that the corresponding software tools obey the corresponding physical constraints. This work aims to provide a basis to establish this connection by investigating the broad spectrum of capabilities intrinsic to the NAQC platform and its implications on the compilation process. To this end, we first review the physical background of NAQC and derive how it affects the overall compilation process by formulating suitable constraints and figures of merit. We then provide a summary of the compilation process and discuss currently available software tools in this overview. Finally, we present selected case studies and employ the discussed figures of merit to evaluate the different capabilities of NAQC and compare them between two hardware setups.

TI Optical coherent manipulation of alkaline-earth circular Rydberg states
SO NATURE PHYSICS
AB Owing to their large size, Rydberg atoms are promising tools for quantum technologies(1,2), as they exhibit long-range dipole-dipole interactions and strong coupling to external fields. Recent experiments have demonstrated their appeal for quantum simulation purposes(3-5), even though the relatively short lifetime of optically accessible Rydberg levels imposes limitations. Long-lived circular Rydberg states(6,7)may provide a solution. However, the detection of circular states involves either destructive(6) or complex(7) measurement techniques. Moreover, so far, alkali circular states have been manipulated only by microwave fields, which are unable to address individual atoms. The use of circular states of a different group of atoms, the alkaline-earth metals, which have an optically active second valence electron, can circumvent these problems. Here we show how to use the electrostatic coupling between the two valence electrons of strontium to coherently manipulate a circular Rydberg state with optical pulses. We also exploit this coupling to map the state of the Rydberg electron onto that of the ionic core. This experiment opens the way to a state-selective spatially resolved non-destructive detection of circular states and to the realization of a hybrid optical-microwave platform for quantum technology.

TI Self-mitigating Trotter circuits for SU(2) lattice gauge theory on a
   quantum computer
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW D
AB Quantum computers offer the possibility to implement lattice gauge theory in Minkowski rather than Euclidean spacetime, thus allowing calculations of processes that evolve in real time. In this work, calculations within SU(2) pure gauge theory are able to show the motion of an excitation traveling across a spatial lattice in real time. This is accomplished by using a simple yet powerful method for error mitigation, where the original circuit is used both forward and backward in time. For a two-plaquette lattice, meaningful results are obtained from a circuit containing hundreds of CNOT gates. The same method is used for a five-plaquette lattice, where calculations show that residual systematic effects can be reduced through follow-up mitigation.

TI Quantum and classical algorithms for nonlinear unitary dynamics
SO QUANTUM
AB Quantum algorithms for Hamiltonian simulation and linear differential equations more generally have provided promising exponential speed-ups over classical computers on a set of problems with high real-world interest. However, extending this to a nonlinear problem has proven challenging, with exponential lower bounds having been demonstrated for the time scaling. We provide a quantum algorithm matching these bounds. Specifically, we find that for a non-linear differential equation of the form d|u >/ dt = A|u > + B|u >(circle times 2) for evolution of time T , error tolerance & varepsilon; and c dependent on the strength of the nonlinearity, the number of queries to the differential operators that approaches the scaling of the quantum lower bound of e(o(T parallel to B parallel to)) queries in the limit of strong non-linearity. Finally, we introduce a classical algorithm based on the Euler method allowing comparably scaling to the quantum algorithm in a restricted case, as well as a randomized classical algorithm based on path integration that acts as a true analogue to the quantum algorithm in that it scales comparably to the quantum algorithm in tailored cases where sign problems are absent.

TI Wigner molecules and hybrid qubits
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICS-CONDENSED MATTER
AB It is demonstrated that exact diagonalization of the microscopic many-body Hamiltonian via systematic full configuration-interaction (FCI) calculations is able to predict the spectra as a function of detuning of three-electron hybrid qubits based on GaAs asymmetric double quantum dots (QDs). It is further shown that, as a result of strong inter-electron correlations, these spectroscopic patterns, including avoided crossings between states associated with different electron occupancies of the left and right wells, are inextricably related to the formation of Wigner molecules (WMs). These physical entities cannot be captured by the previously employed independent-particle or Hubbard-type theoretical modeling of the hybrid qubit. We report remarkable agreement with recent experimental results. Moreover, the present FCI methodology for multi-well QDs can be straightforwardly extended to treat Si/SiGe hybrid qubits, where the central role of WMs was recently experimentally confirmed as well.

TI Characterization and thermometry of dissipatively stabilized steady
   states
SO QUANTUM SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB In this work we study the properties of dissipatively stabilized steady states of noisy quantum algorithms, exploring the extent to which they can be well approximated as thermal distributions, and proposing methods to extract the effective temperature T. We study an algorithm called the relaxational quantum eigensolver (RQE), which is one of a family of algorithms that attempt to find ground states and balance error in noisy quantum devices. In RQE, we weakly couple a second register of auxiliary 'shadow' qubits to the primary system in Trotterized evolution, thus engineering an approximate zero-temperature bath by periodically resetting the auxiliary qubits during the algorithm's runtime. Balancing the infinite temperature bath of random gate error, RQE returns states with an average energy equal to a constant fraction of the ground state. We probe the steady states of this algorithm for a range of base error rates, using several methods for estimating both T and deviations from thermal behavior. In particular, we both confirm that the steady states of these systems are often well-approximated by thermal distributions, and show that the same resources used for cooling can be adopted for thermometry, yielding a fairly reliable measure of the temperature. These methods could be readily implemented in near-term quantum hardware, and for stabilizing and probing Hamiltonians where simulating approximate thermal states is hard for classical computers.

TI Exponential Quantum Speedup in Simulating Coupled Classical Oscillators
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW X
AB We present a quantum algorithm for simulating the classical dynamics of 2n coupled oscillators (e.g., 2n masses coupled by springs). Our approach leverages a mapping between the Schrodinger equation and Newton's equation for harmonic potentials such that the amplitudes of the evolved quantum state encode the momenta and displacements of the classical oscillators. When individual masses and spring constants can be efficiently queried, and when the initial state can be efficiently prepared, the complexity of our quantum algorithm is polynomial inn, almost linear in the evolution time, and sublinear in the sparsity. As an example application, we apply our quantum algorithm to efficiently estimate the kinetic energy of an oscillator at any time. We show that any classical algorithm solving this same problem is inefficient and must make 2 omega on thorn queries to the oracle, and when the oracles are instantiated by efficient quantum circuits, the problem is bounded -error quantum polynomial time complete. Thus, our approach solves a potentially practical application with an exponential speedup over classical computers. Finally, we show that under similar conditions our approach can efficiently simulate more general classical harmonic systems with 2n modes.

TI Hybrid Quantum Vision Transformers for Event Classification in High
   Energy Physics
SO AXIOMS
AB Models based on vision transformer architectures are considered state-of-the-art when it comes to image classification tasks. However, they require extensive computational resources both for training and deployment. The problem is exacerbated as the amount and complexity of the data increases. Quantum-based vision transformer models could potentially alleviate this issue by reducing the training and operating time while maintaining the same predictive power. Although current quantum computers are not yet able to perform high-dimensional tasks, they do offer one of the most efficient solutions for the future. In this work, we construct several variations of a quantum hybrid vision transformer for a classification problem in high-energy physics (distinguishing photons and electrons in the electromagnetic calorimeter). We test them against classical vision transformer architectures. Our findings indicate that the hybrid models can achieve comparable performance to their classical analogs with a similar number of parameters.

TI Refraction of the Two-Photon Multimode Field via a Three-Level Atom

AB Classically, the refractive index of a medium is due to a response on said medium from an electromagnetic field. It has been shown that a single two-level atom interacting with a single photon undergoes dispersion. The following extends that analyses to a three-level system interacting with two photons. Analysis of the system is completed both numerically for all photonic field modes, and analytically for an adiabatic solution of a single field mode. The findings are not only interesting for understanding additional physical phenomena due to the increased complexity of a three-level, two-photon system, but are also necessary for advancing applications such as quantum communications, quantum computation, and quantum information.

TI Service for Deploying Digital Twins of QKD Networks
SO APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL
AB Quantum technologies promise major advances in different areas. From computation to sensing or telecommunications, quantum implementations could bring significant improvements to these fields, arousing the interest of researchers, companies, and governments. In particular, the deployment of Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) networks, which enable the secure dissemination of cryptographic keys to remote application entities following Quantum Mechanics Principles, appears to be one of the most attractive and relevant use cases. Quantum devices and equipment are still in a development phase, making their availability low and their price high, hindering the deployment of physical QKD networks and, therefore, the research and experimentation activities related to this field. In this context, this paper focuses on providing research stakeholders with an open-access testbed where it is feasible to emulate the deployment of QKD networks, thus enabling the execution of experiments and trials, where even potential network attacks can be analyzed, without the quantum physical equipment requirement, nor compromising the integrity of an already built QKD network. The designed solution allows users to automatically deploy, configure, and run a digital twin environment of a QKD network, offering cost-effectiveness and great flexibility in the study of the integration of quantum communications in the current network infrastructures. This solution is aligned with the European Telecommunications Standard Institute (ETSI) standardized application interface for QKD, and is built upon open-source technologies. The feasibility of this solution has been validated throughout several functional trials carried out in the 5G Telefonica Open Network Innovation Centre (5TONIC), verifying the service performance in terms of speed and discarded qubits when generating the quantum keys.

TI Quantum Gradient-Based Methods for Learning Deformable Offsets
SO IET QUANTUM COMMUNICATION
AB This study presents the challenges of learning deformable offsets in conventional machine learning (ML) systems. It significantly focuses on the representation data derived from the MNIST and FashionMNIST datasets. The primary difficulty with this approach is optimising a trade-off between accuracy and efficiency by exploiting the gradient-based algorithm. It is a significant phase of the image recognition and transformation process. Provide a strategy for incorporating quantum approaches utilising quantum loss functions, entanglement, and quantum feature maps to improve on conventional gradient-based techniques. Employ hybrid ways that combine quantum algorithms, such as quantum natural gradient descent (QNGD) and variational quantum eigensolver (VQE), with classical optimisation techniques. This approach is applied to updating deformable offsets and optimising quantum eigenvalue issues. We use quantum Fisher information matrices (FIM) and train tensor networks efficiently and accurately. Then, we performed extensive tests comparing the quantum method with established conventional baselines through hyperparameters, such as accuracy, precision, recall and F1 score. The implementation results demonstrate significant gains in classification accuracy, which exhibit 97% on the MNIST dataset and 87% on the FashionMNIST dataset. The result of the paper emphasises significant conclusions, including improved model stability, increased generalisability and decreased overfitting, due to implementing quantum optimisation techniques. With quantum principles applied to convolution and feature extraction, such data exhibit substantial potential in processing.

TI "All-versus-nothing" proof of genuine tripartite steering and
   entanglement certification in the two-sided device-independent scenario
SO QUANTUM STUDIES-MATHEMATICS AND FOUNDATIONS
AB We consider the task of certification of genuine entanglement of tripartite states. For this purpose, we first present an "all-versus-nothing" proof of genuine tripartite Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR) steering by demonstrating the non-existence of a hybrid local hidden state (LHS) model in the tripartite network as a motivation to our main result. A full logical contradiction of the predictions of the hybrid LHS model with quantum mechanical outcome statistics for any three-qubit generalized Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GGHZ) states and pure W-class states is shown. Using logical contradiction, we can distinguish between the GGHZ and W-class state in two-sided device-independent (2SDI) steering scenario. We next formulate a 2SDI steering inequality which is a generalisation of the fine-grained steering inequality (FGI) derived in [1] for the tripartite scenario. We show that the maximum quantum violation of this tripartite FGI can be used to certify genuine entanglement of three-qubit pure states.

TI Quantum light sources with configurable lifetime leveraging parity-time
   symmetry
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Quantum light sources with configurable photon lifetimes are essential for large-scale quantum circuits, enabling applications in programmable quantum computing, quantum communications, and quantum metrology. However, the fundamental trade-off between efficiency and photon lifetime imposes significant challenges on the design of high-performance, large configurable lifetime quantum light sources. Here, we report on such chip-scale quantum light sources by harnessing the unique feature of parity-time (PT) symmetry. The core design centers on employing PT-symmetric coupling between two microresonators of distinct circumferences, enabling a broad range and selective tuning of the intracavity photon density of states. By controlling the alignment between resonators, we achieved a near 20-fold photon lifetime tuning range (7.1 +/- 1.5 similar to 129.6 +/- 1.9 ps), with the shortest lifetimes near the exceptional point (EP). The device generates energy-time entangled photon pairs with 87.1 +/- 1.1% interference visibility and a heralded second-order autocorrelation of g(H)((2)) 0.069 +/- 0.001. Our work highlights the potential of PT symmetry for advanced quantum applications, including high-speed communication and programmable quantum computing, quantum coherent tomography, and beyond.

TI Summing free unitary Brownian motions with applications to quantum
   information
SO LETTERS IN MATHEMATICAL PHYSICS
AB Motivated by quantum information theory, we introduce a dynamical random density matrix built out of the sum of k =2 independent unitary Brownian motions. In the large size limit, its spectral distribution equals, up to a normalising factor, that of the free Jacobi process associated with a single self-adjoint projection with trace 1/k. Using free stochastic calculus, we extend this equality to the radial part of the free average of k free unitary Brownian motions and to the free Jacobi process associated with two self-adjoint projections with trace 1/k, provided the initial distributions coincide. In the single projection case, we derive a binomial-type expansion of the moments of the free Jacobi process which extends to any k = 3 the one derived in Demni et al. (Indiana Univ Math J 61:1351-1368, 2012) in the special case k = 2. Doing so give rise to a non normal (except for k = 2) operator arising from the splitting of a selfadjoint projection into the convex sum of k unitary operators. This binomial expansion is then used to derive a pde satisfied by the moment generating function of this non normal operator and for which we determine the corresponding characteristic curves. As an application of our results, we compute the average purity and the entanglement entropy of the large-size limiting density matrix.

TI Quantum speed limits for change of basis
SO NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB Quantum speed limits provide ultimate bounds on the time required to transform one quantum state into another. Here, we introduce a novel notion of quantum speed limits for collections of quantum states, investigating the time for converting a basis of states into an unbiased one as well as basis permutation. Establishing an unbiased basis, we provide tight bounds for the systems of dimension smaller than 5, and general bounds for multi-qubit systems and the Hilbert space dimension d. For two-qubit systems, we show that the fastest transformation implements two Hadamards and a swap of the qubits simultaneously. We further prove that for qutrit systems the evolution time depends on the particular type of the unbiased basis. Permuting a basis, we obtain the exact expression for the Hilbert space of dimension d. We also investigate speed limits for coherence generation, providing the minimal time to establish a certain amount of coherence with a unitary evolution.

We focus on the enhancement and degradation of maximal concurrence when the system is driven on and out of resonance for a general evolution, as well as the effect of adding a transverse coupling among the particles of the model. We further investigate the role of driving in the acquisition of a geometric phase for the maximally entangled state. As the model studied herein can be used to model experimental situations such as hybrid quantum classical systems feasible with current technologies, this knowledge can aid the search for physical setups that best retain quantum properties under dissipative dynamics.

TI Two-dimensional spin systems in PECVD-grown diamond with tunable density
   and long coherence for enhanced quantum sensing and simulation
SO APL MATERIALS
AB Systems of spins engineered with tunable density and reduced dimensionality enable a number of advancements in quantum sensing and simulation. Defects in diamond, such as nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers and substitutional nitrogen (P1 centers), are particularly promising solid-state platforms to explore. However, the ability to controllably create coherent, two-dimensional spin systems and characterize their properties, such as density, depth confinement, and coherence, is an outstanding materials challenge. We present a refined approach to engineer dense (?1 ppm . nm), 2D nitrogen, and NV layers in diamond using delta-doping during plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition epitaxial growth. We employ both traditional materials techniques, e.g., secondary ion mass spectrometry, alongside NV spin decoherence-based measurements to characterize the density and dimensionality of the P1 and NV layers. We find P1 densities of 5-10 ppm . nm, NV densities between 1 and 3.5 ppm . nm tuned via electron irradiation dosage, and depth confinement of the spin layer down to 1.6 nm. We also observe high (up to 0.74) ratios of NV to P1 centers and reproducibly long NV coherence times, dominated by dipolar interactions with the engineered P1 and NV spin baths.

TI The Fermionic Quantum Emulator
SO QUANTUM
AB The fermionic quantum emulator (FQE) is a collection of protocols for emulating quantum dynamics of fermions efficiently taking advantage of common symmetries present in chemical, materials, and condensed-matter systems. The library is fully integrated with the OpenFermion software package and serves as the simulation backend. The FQE reduces memory footprint by exploiting number and spin symmetry along with custom evolution routines for sparse and dense Hamiltonians, allowing us to study significantly larger quantum circuits at modest computational cost when compared against qubit state vector simulators. This release paper outlines the technical details of the simulation methods and key advantages.

TI Coherent Spins in van der Waals Semiconductor GeS2 at Ambient
   Conditions
SO NANO LETTERS
AB Optically active spin defects in van der Waals (vdW) materials have emerged as versatile quantum sensors, enabling applications for a wide range of quantum phenomena in condensed matter systems. Their ease of exfoliation and compatibility with device integration make them promising candidates for future quantum technologies. Here we report the observation and room-temperature coherent control of ensemble spin defects in the high-temperature crystalline phase of germanium disulfide (beta-GeS2), a two-dimensional (2D) semiconductor with low nuclear spin density. The defects exhibit spin-1/2 behavior, and their dynamics can be explained by a weakly coupled spin-pair model. We implement dynamical decoupling techniques to extend the coherence time (T 2) by a factor of 20. Finally, we use density functional theory (DFT) calculations to estimate the structures and spin densities of two possible spin defect candidates. This work will help to expand the field of quantum sensing with spin defects in 2D materials.

TI Experimental estimation of the quantum Fisher information from
   randomized measurements
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB The quantum Fisher information (QFI) represents a fundamental concept in quantum physics. It quantifies the metrological potential of quantum states in quantum parameter estimation measurements, and is intrinsically related to quantum geometry and multipartite entanglement of many-body systems. Using a nitrogen-vacancy center spin in diamond, we experimentally demonstrate a randomized-measurement method to extract the QFI of the qubit, for both pure and mixed states. We then apply this scheme to a 4-qubit state, using a superconducting quantum computer, and show that it provides access to the sub-QFI, which sets a lower bound on the QFI for general mixed states. We numerically study the scaling of statistical error, considering N-qubit states, to illustrate the advantage of our randomized-measurement approach in estimating the QFI and multipartite entanglement. Our results highlight the general applicability of our method to different quantum platforms, including solid-state spin systems, superconducting quantum computers, and trapped ions.

TI Solving hadron structures using the basis light-front quantization
   approach on quantum computers
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Quantum computing has demonstrated the potential to revolutionize our understanding of nuclear, atomic, and molecular structure by obtaining forefront solutions in nonrelativistic quantum many-body theory. In this work, we show that quantum computing can be used to solve for the structure of hadrons, governed by strongly interacting relativistic quantum field theory. Following our previous work on light unflavored mesons as a relativistic bound-state problem within the nonperturbative Hamiltonian formalism, we present the numerical calculations on simulated quantum devices using the basis light-front quantization approach. We implement and compare the variational quantum eigensolver and the subspace-search variational quantum eigensolver to find the low-lying mass spectrum of the light meson system and its corresponding light-front wave functions as quantum states from ideal simulators, noisy simulators, and IBM quantum computers. Based on obtained quantum states, we evaluate the meson decay constants and parton distribution functions directly on the quantum circuits. Our calculations on the quantum computers and simulators are in reasonable agreement with accurate numerical solutions solved on classical computers when noises are moderately small, and our overall results are comparable with the available experimental data.

TI Parameterized Bipartite Entanglement Measures and Entanglement
   Constraints
SO ADVANCED QUANTUM TECHNOLOGIES
AB This work proposes a novel class of parameterized entanglement measures that are named as G(omega)-concurrence (G(omega)C) (0 < omega <= 1), and demonstrates comprehensively that they satisfy all the necessary axiomatic conditions required for an entanglement measure. Furthermore, an analytical formula relating G omega C to concurrence for the range of 0.85798 <= omega <= 1 within two-qubit systems is derived. Additionally, a new polygamy relation of multiqubit quantum entanglement in terms of G(omega)-concurrence of assistance (G(omega)CoA) is proved. However, it fails to obey the monogamy relation, but it is demonstrated that the squared G(omega)-concurrence (SG(omega)C) does obey a general monogamy relation in an arbitrary NN-qubit mixed state. Utilizing the monogamy properties of SG(omega)C, the corresponding multipartite entanglement indicators can be constructed, which can detect all genuine multiqubit entangled states even in the case of NN-tangle vanishes. In addition, for multipartite higher-dimensional systems, it is illustrated that SG(omega)C still has the applicability of the monogamy relation.

TI An Open Quantum System Interacting with an Interference Engineering
   Environment
SO ENTROPY
AB In this paper, we investigate the interference engineering of the open quantum system, where the environment is made indefinite either through the use of an interferometer or the introduction of auxiliary qubits. The environments are modeled by fully connected qubit baths with exact analytical dynamics. As the system passes through the interferometer or is controlled by auxiliary qubits, it is propagated along different paths or their superpositions, leading to distinct interactions with the environment in each path. This results in the superposition of the environments, which can be detected through specific measurements that retain certain coherent information about the paths. Our results demonstrate that the indefiniteness of the environment can significantly enhance the quantum correlations. However, only the statistical mixture of the influences from the environments is preserve provided that the path coherence is destructed. We also examine the serviceability of the indefiniteness as a resource for teleportation and quantum parameter estimation. Additionally, we discuss how to quantify the indefiniteness and the ways in which it affects the system's dynamics from the perspective of wave-particle-entanglement-ignorance complementarity. Our study highlights the potential benefits of an indefinite environment in quantum information processing and sheds light on the fundamental principles underlying its effects.

TI Protection of entanglement in two independently decohering qubits via
   local prior and post parity-time symmetry operations
SO LASER PHYSICS
AB Protection of entanglement of two qubits undergoing two independent amplitude damping channels using a local parity-time (PT) symmetric operation is exactly studied. First, the explicit expressions of concurrence quantifying the entanglement of two qubits with both local PT symmetric operation and two amplitude damping channels are obtained. Then, we give two schemes, i.e. prior and post PT symmetric operations, to show the performance of PT symmetric operation on entanglement dynamics of two qubits. By investigation, we find that the effect of prior PT symmetric operation schemes on the protection of entanglement of two qubits in the double channel case is superior to that of the single channel case. Conversely, the effect of post PT symmetric operation scheme on the protection of entanglement of two qubits in the single channel case is better than that in the double channel case. In other words, the local PT symmetric operation approach may have potential applications in combating amplitude damping decoherence.

TI Quantum circuit representation of Bayesian networks
SO EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS
AB Probabilistic graphical models such as Bayesian networks are widely used to model stochastic systems to perform various types of analysis such as probabilistic prediction, risk analysis, and system health monitoring, which can become computationally expensive in large-scale systems. While demonstrations of true quantum supremacy remain rare, quantum computing applications managing to exploit the advantages of amplitude amplification have shown significant computational benefits when compared against their classical counterparts. We develop a systematic method for designing a quantum circuit to represent a generic discrete Bayesian network with nodes that may have two or more states, where nodes with more than two states are mapped to multiple qubits. The marginal probabilities associated with root nodes (nodes without any parent nodes) are represented using rotation gates, and the conditional probability tables associated with non-root nodes are represented using controlled rotation gates. The controlled rotation gates with more than one control qubit are represented using ancilla qubits. The proposed approach is demonstrated for three examples: a 4-node oil company stock prediction, a 10-node network for liquidity risk assessment, and a 9-node naive Bayes classifier for bankruptcy prediction. The circuits were designed and simulated using Qiskit, a quantum computing platform that enables simulations and also has the capability to run on real quantum hardware. The results were validated against those obtained from classical Bayesian network implementations.

TI Estimation of Quantum Fisher Information via Stein's Identity in
   Variational Quantum Algorithms
SO QUANTUM
AB The Quantum Fisher Information Matrix (QFIM) plays a crucial role in quantum optimization algorithms such as Variational Quantum Imaginary Time Evolution and Quantum Natural Gradient Descent. However, computing the full QFIM incurs a quadratic computational cost of O(d2) with respect to the number of parameters d, limiting its scalability for high-dimensional quantum systems. To address this limitation, stochastic methods such as the Simultaneous Perturbation Stochastic Approximation (SPSA) have been employed to reduce computational complexity to a constant [Quantum 5, 567 (2021)]. In this work, we propose an alternative estimation framework based on Stein's identity that also achieves constant computational complexity. Furthermore, our method reduces the quantum resources required for QFIM estimation compared to the SPSA approach. We provide numerical examples using the transverse-field Ising model and the lattice Schwinger model to demonstrate the feasibility of applying our method to realistic quantum systems.

TI Dynamics and computation in linear open quantum walks
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Open quantum walks (OQWs) are a type of quantum walk governed by the system's interaction with its environment. We explore the time evolution and the limit behavior of the OQW framework for quantum computation and show how we can represent random unitary quantum channels, such as the dephasing and depolarizing channels, in this model. We also develop a simulation protocol with circuit representation for this model, which is heavily inspired by the fact that graphs represent OQWs and are thereby local (meaning that the state in a particular node interacts only with its neighborhood). We obtain asymptotic advantages in the system's dimension, circuit depth, and CNOT count compared to other simulation methods.

TI Quantum microscopy based on Hong-Ou-Mandel interference
SO NATURE PHOTONICS
AB Hong-Ou-Mandel (HOM) interference-the bunching of indistinguishable photons at a beamsplitter-is a staple of quantum optics and lies at the heart of many quantum sensing approaches and recent optical quantum computers. Here we report a full-field, scan-free quantum imaging technique that exploits HOM interference to reconstruct the surface depth profile of transparent samples. We demonstrate the ability to retrieve images with micrometre-scale depth features with photon flux as small as seven photon pairs per frame. Using a single-photon avalanche diode camera, we measure both bunched and anti-bunched photon-pair distributions at the output of an HOM interferometer, which are combined to provide a lower-noise image of the sample. This approach demonstrates the possibility of HOM microscopy as a tool for the label-free imaging of transparent samples in the very low photon regime.
   Hong-Ou-Mandel interference enables depth-resolved quantum imaging at very low light levels.

TI Scattering-lens based quantum imaging beyond shot noise
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB The scheme of optical imaging using scattering lens can provide a resolution beyond the classical optical diffraction limit with a coherent-state input. Nevertheless, due to the shot noise of the coherent state, the corresponding signal-to-noise ratio and resolution are both still shot-noise-limited. In order to circumvent this problem, we theoretically propose an alternative scheme where the squeezed state (with a sub-shot noise) is considered as input and the quantum noise is then suppressed below the shot-noise level. Consequently, when comparing with the previous imaging scheme (using combination of coherent state and scattering lens), our proposal is able to achieve an enhanced signal-to-noise ratio for a given scattering lens. Meanwhile, it is demonstrated that the resolution is also improved. We believe that this method may afford a new way of using squeezed states and enable a higher performance than that of using coherent state and scattering lens.

TI Configurable sublinear circuits for quantum state preparation
SO QUANTUM INFORMATION PROCESSING
AB The theory of quantum algorithms promises unprecedented benefits of harnessing the laws of quantum mechanics for solving certain computational problems. A prerequisite for applying quantum algorithms to a wide range of real-world problems is loading classical data to a quantum state. Several circuit-based methods have been proposed for encoding classical data as probability amplitudes of a quantum state. However, in these methods, either quantum circuit depth or width must grow linearly with the data size, nullifying the advantage of representing exponentially many classical data in a quantum state. In this paper, we present a configurable bidirectional procedure that addresses this problem by tailoring the resource trade-off between quantum circuit width and depth. In particular, we show a configuration that encodes an N-dimensional classical data using a quantum circuit whose width and depth both grow sublinearly with N. We demonstrate proof-of-principle implementations on five quantum computers accessed through the IBM and IonQ quantum cloud services.

TI Sub-Hz fundamental, sub-kHz integral linewidth self-injection locked 780
   nm hybrid integrated laser
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB Today's precision experiments for timekeeping, inertial sensing, and fundamental science place strict requirements on the spectral distribution of laser frequency noise. Rubidium-based experiments utilize table-top 780 nm laser systems for high-performance clocks, gravity sensors, and quantum gates. Wafer-scale integration of these lasers is critical for enabling systems-on-chip. Despite progress towards chip-scale 780 nm ultra-narrow linewidth lasers, achieving sub-Hz fundamental linewidth and sub-kHz integral linewidth has remained elusive. Here we report a hybrid integrated 780 nm self-injection locked laser with 0.74 Hz fundamental and 864 Hz integral linewidths and thermorefractive-noise-limited 100 Hz2/Hz at 10 kHz. These linewidths are over an order of magnitude lower than previous photonic-integrated 780 nm implementations. The laser consists of a Fabry-P & eacute;rot diode edge-coupled to an on-chip splitter and a tunable 90 million Q resonator realized in the CMOS foundry-compatible silicon nitride platform. We achieve 2 mW output power, 36 dB side mode suppression ratio, and a 2.5 GHz mode-hop-free tuning range. To demonstrate the potential for quantum atomic applications, we analyze the laser noise influence on sensitivity limits for atomic clocks, quantum gates, and atom interferometer gravimeters. This technology can be translated to other atomic wavelengths, enabling compact, ultra-low noise lasers for quantum sensing, computing, and metrology.

TI Restrictions on shareability of classical correlations for random
   multipartite quantum states
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Unlike quantum correlations, the shareability of classical correlations (CCs) between two parties of a multipartite state is assumed to be free since there exist states for which CCs for each of the reduced states can simultaneously reach their algebraic maximum value. However, when one randomly picks out states from the state space, we find that the probability of obtaining those states possessing the algebraic maximum value is vanishingly small. Therefore, the possibility of a nontrivial upper bound on the distribution of CCs that is less than the algebraic maxima emerges. We explore this possibility by Haar uniformly generating random multipartite states and computing the frequency distribution for various CC measures, conventional classical correlators, and two axiomatic measures of classical correlations, namely, the classical part of quantum discord and local work of work-deficit. We find that the distributions are typically Gaussian-like and their standard deviations decrease with the increase in number of parties. It also reveals that, among the multiqubit random states, most of the reduced density matrices possess a low amount of CCs which can also be confirmed by the mean of the distributions, thereby showing a kind of restrictions on the shareability of classical correlations for random states. Furthermore, we also notice that the maximal value for random states is much lower than the algebraic maxima obtained for a set of states, and the gap between the two increases further for states with a higher number of parties. We report that, for a higher number of parties, the classical part of quantum discord and local work can follow a monogamy-based upper bound on shareability while classical correlators have a different upper bound. The trends of shareability for classical correlation measures in random states clearly demarcate between the axiomatic definition of classical correlations and the conventional ones.

TI Capacity of Quantum Symmetric Private Information Retrieval With
   Collusion of All But One of Servers
SO IEEE JOURNAL ON SELECTED AREAS IN INFORMATION THEORY
AB Quantum private information retrieval (QPIR) is a protocol in which a user retrieves one of multiple classical files by downloading quantum systems from non-communicating n servers each of which contains a copy of all files, while the identity of the retrieved file is unknown to each server. Symmetric QPIR (QSPIR) is QPIR in which the user only obtains the queried file but no other information of the other files. In this article, we consider the (n - 1)-private QSPIR in which the identity of the retrieved file is secret even if any n - 1 servers collude, and derive the QSPIR capacity for this problem which is defined as the maximum ratio of the retrieved file size to the total size of the downloaded quantum systems. For any even number n of servers, we show that the capacity of the (n-1)-private QSPIR is 2/n, when we assume that there are prior entanglements among the servers. We construct an (n - 1)-private QSPIR protocol of rate inverted right perpendicular n/2 inverted left perpendicular(-1) and prove that the capacity is upper bounded by 2/n even if any error probability is allowed. The (n - 1)-private QSPIR capacity is strictly greater than the classical counterpart.

TI Predestined Steady-State Entanglement under Pure Vacuum Noise
SO ADVANCED QUANTUM TECHNOLOGIES
AB Ever since the seminal work by Yu and Eberly [Phys. Rev. Lett. 93, 140404 (2004)], it has become widely accepted that nonlocal entanglement is more fragile than local coherence, in the sense that even under the influence of pure vacuum noise, the two-qubit entanglement may end within a finite time, while the single-qubit coherence always decays exponentially. By contrast, in this paper, it is shown that, for a pair of rotating qubits under pure vacuum noise with appropriate orbital radius and angular velocity, nonlocal entanglement as compared to local coherence is not only more resilient against vacuum noise to be preserved in the steady-state for initially entangled states, but more importantly is also predestined to be created and be preserved for initially separable states. The generation of predestined entanglement here is essentially different from the dissipative steady-state entanglement generation in existing schemes insofar as it is inevitably generated in pure vacuum instead of an elaborately designed environment.

TI Statistical and Electrical Modeling of FDSOI Four-Gate Qubit MOS Devices
   at Room Temperature
SO IEEE JOURNAL OF THE ELECTRON DEVICES SOCIETY
AB This paper presents an electrical characterization and a compact modeling of FD-SOI four-gate qubit MOS devices, carried out at room temperature and in linear regime. The main figures of merit are extracted from average drain current curves using Y - function method. Poisson solver-based simulations are performed to interpret the experimental data, in particular the influence among gates and the effective channel length modulation. Furthermore, a drain current matching analysis between gates is conducted, and the main variability parameters are extracted. Our results, despite the unconventional device engineering, show a variability performance comparable to the state-of-the-art 28nm FD-SOI technology. Finally, a Lambert function based model is developed to validate both the electrical and statistical characterization. It is assumed, according to the experimental data, that the four gate device can be modeled as the series of four identical and independent transistors. Including the contribution of source and drain access resistance it has been possible to reproduce the device behavior at high external gates voltages.

TI Quantum efficiency, purity and stability of a tunable, narrowband
   microwave single-photon source
SO NPJ QUANTUM INFORMATION
AB We demonstrate an on-demand source of microwave single photons with 71-99% intrinsic quantum efficiency. The source is narrowband (300 kHz) and tuneable over a 600 MHz range around 5.2 GHz. Such a device is an important element in numerous quantum technologies and applications. The device consists of a superconducting transmon qubit coupled to the open end of a transmission line. A pi-pulse excites the qubit, which subsequently rapidly emits a single photon into the transmission line. A cancellation pulse then suppresses the reflected pi-pulse by 33.5 dB, resulting in 0.005 photons leaking into the photon emission channel. We verify strong antibunching of the emitted photon field and determine its Wigner function. Non-radiative decay and 1/f flux noise both affect the quantum efficiency. We also study the device stability over time and identify uncorrelated discrete jumps of the pure dephasing rate at different qubit frequencies on a time scale of hours, which we attribute to independent two-level system defects in the device dielectrics, dispersively coupled to the qubit. Our single-photon source with only one input port is more compact and scalable compared to standard implementations.

TI Room-temperature quantum coherence of entangled multiexcitons in a
   metal-organic framework
SO SCIENCE ADVANCES
AB Singlet fission can generate an exchange-coupled quintet triplet pair state (TT)-T-5, which could lead to the realization of quantum computing and quantum sensing using entangled multiple qubits even at room temperature. However, the observation of the quantum coherence of (TT)-T-5 has been limited to cryogenic temperatures, and the fundamental question is what kind of material design will enable its room-temperature quantum coherence. Here, we show that the quantum coherence of singlet fission-derived (TT)-T-5 in a chromophore-integrated metal-organic framework can be over hundred nanoseconds at room temperature. The suppressed motion of the chromophores in ordered domains within the metal-organic framework leads to the enough fluctuation of the exchange interaction necessary for (TT)-T-5 generation but, at the same time, does not cause severe (TT)-T-5 decoherence. Furthermore, the phase and amplitude of quantum beating depend on the molecular motion, opening the way to room-temperature molecular quantum computing based on multiple quantum gate control.

TI Boltzmann machine learning with a variational quantum algorithm
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB A Boltzmann machine is a powerful tool for modeling probability distributions that govern the training data. A thermal equilibrium state is typically used for the Boltzmann machine learning to obtain a suitable probability distribution. The Boltzmann machine learning consists of calculating the gradient of the loss function given in terms of the thermal average, which is the most time-consuming procedure. Here, we propose a method to implement the Boltzmann machine learning by using noisy intermediate-scale quantum devices. We prepare an initial pure state that contains all possible computational basis states with the same amplitude, and we apply a variational imaginary time simulation. Readout of the state after the evolution in the computational basis approximates the probability distribution of the thermal equilibrium state that is used for the Boltzmann machine learning. We perform the numerical simulations of our scheme and confirm that the Boltzmann machine learning works well. Our scheme leads to a significant step toward an efficient machine learning using quantum hardware.

TI Research Progress of Single-Photon Emitters Based on Two-Dimensional
   Materials
SO NANOMATERIALS
AB From quantum communications to quantum computing, single-photon emitters (SPEs) are essential components of numerous quantum technologies. Two-dimensional (2D) materials have especially been found to be highly attractive for the research into nanoscale light-matter interactions. In particular, localized photonic states at their surfaces have attracted great attention due to their enormous potential applications in quantum optics. Recently, SPEs have been achieved in various 2D materials, while the challenges still remain. This paper reviews the recent research progress on these SPEs based on various 2D materials, such as transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs), hexagonal boron nitride (hBN), and twisted-angle 2D materials. Additionally, we summarized the strategies to create, position, enhance, and tune the emission wavelength of these emitters by introducing external fields into these 2D system. For example, pronounced enhancement of the SPEs' properties can be achieved by coupling with external fields, such as the plasmonic field, and by locating in optical microcavities. Finally, this paper also discusses current challenges and offers perspectives that could further stimulate scientific research in this field. These emitters, due to their unique physical properties and integration potential, are highly appealing for applications in quantum information and communication, as well as other physical and technological fields.

TI High-Capacity DFF Cells for Unary Computing Using Single-Flux Quantum
   Circuits
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON APPLIED SUPERCONDUCTIVITY
AB Due to their high-speed operation and low power consumption, single-flux quantum (SFQ) circuits are promising technologies for integrated circuits. However, current superconducting fabrication limitations impose strict area constraints, challenging the construction of large-scale systems. Unary computing (UC) encodes numerical values by concentrating all "1"s at the beginning of a bit sequence. This approach enables arithmetic operations with fewer logic gates, thereby improving the area efficiency. In this article, we propose a novel high-capacity D flip-flop (HC-DFF) cell for UC-based SFQ circuits that achieves high-density data registration while preserving UC encoding. The HC-DFF employs a cascaded storage loop structure in which each loop sequentially stores one flux quantum, avoiding the margin deterioration associated with storing multiple flux quanta in a single loop. Simulation shows that the proposed HC-DFF achieves a bias margin of -20.8% to +32.7% and supports read/write operations above 100 GHz. We fabricated the HC-DFF using a 10 kA/cm(2) Nb four-layer superconducting process and verified its operation through low-speed measurements. The HC-DFF offers enhanced scalability and stability while reducing the number of required Josephson junctions by 83.3% per bit compared to conventional DFF-based shift registers for saving UC signals. For short unary sequences of less than 31 bits, it retains an advantage over storing binary data with equivalent precision using conventional DFF-based shift registers.

TI Coherent control of the causal order of entanglement distillation
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Indefinite causal order is an evolving field with potential involvement in quantum technologies. Here we propose and study one possible scenario of practical application in quantum communication: a compound entanglement distillation protocol that features two steps of a basic distillation protocol applied in a coherent superposition of two causal orders. This is achieved by using one faulty entangled pair to control-swap two others before a fourth pair is combined with the two swapped ones consecutively. As a result, the protocol distills the four faulty entangled states into one of a higher fidelity. Our protocol has a higher fidelity of distillation and probability of success for some input faulty pairs than conventional concatenations of the basic protocol that follow a definite distillation order. Our proposal shows the advantage of indefinite causal order in an application setting consistent with the requirements of quantum communication.

TI Nanodiamonds enable femtosecond-processed ultrathin glass as a hybrid
   quantum sensor
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB The quantum properties of fluorescent nanodiamonds offer great promise for fabricating quantum-enabled devices for physical applications. However, the nanodiamonds need to be suitably combined with a substrate to exploit their properties. Here, we show that ultrathin and flexible glass (thickness 30 microns) can be functionalized by nanodiamonds and nano-shaped using intense femtosecond pulses to design cantilever-based nanomechanical hybrid quantum sensors. Thus fabricated ultrathin glass cantilevers show stable optical, electronic, and magnetic properties of nitrogen-vacancy centers, including well-defined fluorescence with zero-phonon lines and optically detected magnetic resonance (ODMR) near 2.87 GHz. We demonstrate several sensing applications of the fluorescent ultrathin glass cantilever by measuring acoustic pulses, external magnetic field using Zeeman splitting of the NV centers, or CW laser-induced heating by measuring thermal shifting of ODMR lines. This work demonstrates the suitability of the femtosecond-processed fluorescent ultrathin glass as a new versatile substrate for multifunctional quantum devices.

TI Synthesis and Upper Bound of Schmidt Rank of Bipartite
   Controlled-Unitary Gates
SO ANNALEN DER PHYSIK
AB Quantum circuit model is the most popular paradigm for implementing complex quantum computation. Based on Cartan decomposition, it is shown 2(N-1)$2(N-1)$ generalized controlled-X (GCX) gates, 6 single-qubit rotations about the y- and z-axes, and N+5$N+5$ single-partite y- and z-rotation-types which are defined in this paper are sufficient to simulate a controlled-unitary gate Ucu(2 circle times N)$\mathcal {U}_{\text{cu}(2\otimes N)}$ with A$\text{A}$ controlling on C2 circle times CN$\mathbb {C}<^>2\otimes \mathbb {C}<^>N$. In the scenario of the unitary gate Ucd(M circle times N)$\mathcal {U}_{\text{cd}(M\otimes N)}$ with M >= 3$M\ge 3$ that is locally equivalent to a diagonal unitary on CM circle times CN$\mathbb {C}<^>M\otimes \mathbb {C}<^>N$, 2M(N-1)$2M(N-1)$ GCX gates and 2M(N-1)+10$2M(N-1)+10$ single-partite y- and z-rotation-types are required to simulate it. The quantum circuit for implementing Ucu(2 circle times N)$\mathcal {U}_{\text{cu}(2\otimes N)}$ and Ucd(M circle times N)$\mathcal {U}_{\text{cd}(M\otimes N)}$ are presented. Furthermore, it is found that Ucu(2 circle times 2)$\mathcal {U}_{\text{cu}(2\otimes 2)}$ with A$\text{A}$ controlling has Schmidt rank two, and in other cases the diagonalized form of the target unitaries can be expanded in terms of specific simple types of product unitary operators.

TI Ab-initio calculations of shallow dopant qubits in silicon from
   pseudopotential and all-electron mixed approach
SO COMMUNICATIONS PHYSICS
AB Modelling the quantum transport properties of qubit arrays and the electronic properties of dopant qubits is computationally challenging yet crucial for device optimization in quantum computing. Here, the authors compare different DFT-based methods to describe the properties of shallow donor-based qubits in silicon.
   Obtaining an accurate first-principle description of the electronic properties of dopant qubits is critical for engineering and optimizing high-performance quantum computing. However, density functional theory (DFT) has had limited success in providing a full quantitative description of these dopants due to their large wavefunction extent. Here, we build on recent advances in DFT to evaluate phosphorus dopants in silicon on a lattice comprised of 4096 atoms with hybrid functionals on a pseudopotential and all-electron mixed approach. Remarkable agreement is achieved with experimental measurements including: the electron-nuclear hyperfine coupling (115.5 MHz) and its electric field response (-2.65 x 10(-3) mu m(2)/V-2), the binding energy (46.07 meV), excited valley-orbital energies of 1sT(2) (37.22 meV) and 1sE (35.87 meV) states, and super-hyperfine couplings of the proximal shells of the silicon lattice. This quantitative description of spin and orbital properties of phosphorus dopant simultaneously from a single theoretical framework will help as a predictive tool for the design of qubits.

AB PyCCE, an open-source Python library for simulating the dynamics of spin qubits in a spin bath, is presented using the cluster-correlation expansion (CCE) method. PyCCE includes modules to generate realistic spin baths, employing coupling parameters computed from first principles with electronic structure codes, and enables the user to run simulations with either the conventional or generalized CCE method. Three use cases of the Python library are illustrated: the calculation of the Hahn-echo coherence time of the nitrogen-vacancy in diamond; the calculation of the coherence time of the basal divacancy in silicon carbide at avoided crossings; and the calculation for magnetic field orientation-dependent dynamics of a shallow donor in silicon. The complete documentation, downloadable tutorials, and installation instructions are available at https://pycce.readthedocs.io/en/latest/.

TI Speeding up the spread of quantum information in chaotic systems
SO JOURNAL OF HIGH ENERGY PHYSICS
AB We explore the effect of introducing mild nonlocality into otherwise local, chaotic quantum systems, on the rate of information spreading and associated rates of entanglement generation and operator growth. We consider various forms of nonlocality, both in 1-dimensional spin chain models and in holographic gauge theories, comparing the phenomenology of each. Generically, increasing the level of nonlocality increases the rate of information spreading, but in lattice models we find instances where these rates are slightly suppressed.

TI Communication with quantum catalysts
SO QUANTUM SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB Communication is essential for advancing science and technology. Quantum communication, in particular, benefits from the use of catalysts. During the communication process, these catalysts enhance performance while remaining unchanged. Although chemical catalysts that undergo deactivation typically perform worse than those that remain unaffected, quantum catalysts, referred to as embezzling catalysts, can surprisingly outperform their non-deactivating counterparts despite experiencing slight alterations. In this work, we employ embezzling quantum catalysts to enhance the transmission of both quantum and classical information. By utilizing finite-dimensional embezzling catalysts, we guarantee a non-zero catalytic channel capacity for any quantum channel while keeping variations in the catalytic system arbitrarily small. Our protocol also improves long-distance entanglement distribution. Furthermore, we introduce catalytic superdense coding, demonstrating how embezzling catalysts can boost the transmission of classical information. Finally, we explore methods to reduce the dimensionality of catalysts, a step toward making quantum catalysis a practical reality.

TI Quantum information scrambling in two-dimensional Bose-Hubbard lattices
SO CHAOS
AB It is a well-understood fact that the transport of excitations throughout a lattice is intimately governed by the underlying structures. Hence, it is only natural to recognize that the dispersion of information also has to depend on the lattice geometry. In the present work, we demonstrate that two-dimensional lattices described by the Bose-Hubbard model exhibit information scrambling for systems as little as two hexagons. However, we also find that the out-of-time-ordered correlator (OTOC) shows the exponential decay characteristic for quantum chaos only for a judicious choice of local observables. More generally, the OTOC is better described by Gaussian-exponential convolutions, which alludes to the close similarity of information scrambling and decoherence theory.

TI Coreset Clustering on Small Quantum Computers
SO ELECTRONICS
AB Many quantum algorithms for machine learning require access to classical data in superposition. However, for many natural data sets and algorithms, the overhead required to load the data set in superposition can erase any potential quantum speedup over classical algorithms. Recent work by Harrow introduces a new paradigm in hybrid quantum-classical computing to address this issue, relying on coresets to minimize the data loading overhead of quantum algorithms. We investigated using this paradigm to perform k-means clustering on near-term quantum computers, by casting it as a QAOA optimization instance over a small coreset. We used numerical simulations to compare the performance of this approach to classical k-means clustering. We were able to find data sets with which coresets work well relative to random sampling and where QAOA could potentially outperform standard k-means on a coreset. However, finding data sets where both coresets and QAOA work well-which is necessary for a quantum advantage over k-means on the entire data set-appears to be challenging.

TI A nondestructive Bell-state measurement on two distant atomic qubits
SO NATURE PHOTONICS
AB One of the most fascinating aspects of quantum networks is their capability to distribute entanglement as a nonlocal communication resource(1). In a first step, this requires network-ready devices that can generate and store entangled states(2). Another crucial step, however, is to develop measurement techniques that allow for entanglement detection. Demonstrations for different platforms(3-13) suffer from being not complete, destructive or local. Here, we demonstrate a complete and nondestructive measurement scheme(14-16) that always projects any initial state of two spatially separated network nodes onto a maximally entangled state. Each node consists of an atom trapped inside an optical resonator from which two photons are successively reflected. Polarization measurements on the photons discriminate between the four maximally entangled states. Remarkably, such states are not destroyed by our measurement. In the future, our technique might serve to probe the decay of entanglement and to stabilize it against dephasing via repeated measurements(17,18).

TI Neural networks for quantum inverse problems
SO NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB Quantum inverse problem (QIP) is the problem of estimating an unknown quantum system from a set of measurements, whereas the classical counterpart is the inverse problem of estimating a distribution from a set of observations. In this paper, we present a neural-network-based method for QIPs, which has been widely explored for its classical counterpart. The proposed method utilizes the quantumness of the QIPs and takes advantage of the computational power of neural networks to achieve remarkable efficiency for the quantum state estimation. We test the method on the problem of maximum entropy estimation of an unknown state rho from partial information both numerically and experimentally. Our method yields high fidelity, efficiency and robustness for both numerical experiments and quantum optical experiments.

TI Minimal constraints in the parity formulation of optimization problems
SO NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB As a means to solve optimization problems using quantum computers, the problem is typically recast into an Ising spin model whose ground-state is the solution of the optimization problem. An alternative to the Ising formulation is the Lechner-Hauke-Zoller model, which has the form of a lattice gauge model with nearest neighbor four-body constraints. Here we introduce a method to find the minimal strength of the constraints which are required to conserve the correct ground-state. Based on this, we derive upper and lower bounds for the minimal constraints strengths. We find that, depending on the problem class, the exponent ranges from constant alpha = 0 to quadratic alpha = 2 scaling with the number of logical qubits.

TI Superconductor-semiconductor hybrid capacitance with a nonlinear
   charge-voltage profile
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICS D-APPLIED PHYSICS
AB Electronic devices that work in the quantum regime often employ hybrid nanostructures to bring about a nonlinear behaviour. The nonlinearity that these can provide has proven to be useful, in particular, for applications in quantum computation. Here we present a hybrid device that acts as a capacitor with a nonlinear charge-voltage relation. The device consists of a nanowire placed between the plates of a coplanar capacitor, with a co-parallel alignment. At low temperatures, due to the finite density of states on the nanowire, the charge distribution in the capacitor is uneven and energy-dependent, resulting in a charge-dependent effective capacitance. We study this system analytically and numerically, and show that the nonlinearity of the capacitance is significant enough to be utilized in circuit quantum electrodynamics. The resulting nonlinearity can be switched on, modulated, and switched off by an external potential, thus making this capacitive device highly versatile for uses in quantum computation.

TI Effects of surface treatments on flux tunable transmon qubits
SO NPJ QUANTUM INFORMATION
AB One of the main limitations in state-of-the art solid-state quantum processors is qubit decoherence and relaxation due to noise from adsorbates on surfaces, impurities at interfaces, and material defects. For the field to advance towards full fault-tolerant quantum computing, a better understanding of these microscopic noise sources is therefore needed. Here, we use an ultra-high vacuum package to study the impact of vacuum loading, UV-light exposure, and ion irradiation treatments on relaxation and coherence times, as well as slow parameter fluctuations of flux tunable superconducting transmon qubits. The treatments studied do not significantly impact the relaxation rate Gamma(1) and the echo decay rate Gamma(e)(2;SS) at the sweet spot, except for Ne ion bombardment which reduces Gamma(1). In contrast, flux noise parameters are improved by removing magnetic adsorbates from the chip surfaces with UV-light and NH3 treatments. Additionally, we demonstrate that SF6 ion bombardment can be used to adjust qubit frequencies in situ and post-fabrication without affecting qubit relaxation and coherence times at the sweet spot.

TI Overhead for simulating a non-local channel with local channels by
   quasiprobability sampling
SO QUANTUM
AB As the hardware technology for quantum computing advances, its possible applications are actively searched and developed. However, such applications still suffer from the noise on quantum devices, in particular when using two-qubit gates whose fidelity is relatively low. One way to overcome this difficulty is to substitute such non-local operations by local ones. Such substitution can be performed by decomposing a non-local channel into a linear combination of local channels and simulating the original channel with a quasiprobability-based method. In this work, we first define a quantity that we call channel robustness of non-locality, which quantifies the cost for the decomposition. While this quantity is challenging to calculate for a general non-local channel, we give an upper bound for a general two-qubit unitary channel by providing an explicit decomposition. The decomposition is obtained by generalizing our previous work whose application has been restricted to a certain form of two-qubit unitary. This work develops a framework for a resource reduction suitable for first-generation quantum devices.

TI Basic entanglement distillation with realistic noise
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Entanglement distillation is a key component of modular quantum computing and long-range quantum communications. However, this powerful tool to reduce noise in entangled states is difficult to realize in practice for two main reasons. First, operations used to carry out distillation inject noise they seek to remove. Second, the extent to which distillation can work under realistic device noise is less well studied. In this work, we both simulate distillation using a variety of device noise models and perform distillation experiments on fixed-frequency IBM devices. We find reasonable agreement between experimental data and simulation done using Pauli and non-Pauli noise models. In our data, we find broad improvement when the metric of success for distillation is to improve average Bell fidelity under effective global depolarizing noise, remove coherent errors, or improve the Bell fidelity of mildly degraded Bell pairs. We pave the way to obtain broad improvement from distillation under a stricter, but practically relevant, metric: distill (physically) nonlocal Bell pairs with higher fidelity than possible to obtain with other available methods. Our results also help understand metrics and requirements for quantum devices to use entanglement distillation as a primitive for modular computing.

TI Thermal-noise-resistant optomechanical entanglement via general
   dark-mode control
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Quantum entanglement not only plays an important role in the study of the fundamentals of quantum theory, but also is considered as a crucial resource in quantum information science. The generation of macroscopic entanglement involving multiple optical and mechanical modes is a desired task in cavity optomechanics. However, the dark-mode effect is a critical obstacle against the generation of quantum entanglement in multimode optomechanical systems consisting of multiple degenerate or near-degenerate mechanical modes coupled to a common cavity mode. Here we propose an auxiliary-cavity-mode method to enhance optome-chanical entanglement in a multimode optomechanical system by breaking the dark-mode effect. We find that the introduction of the auxiliary cavity mode not only assists the entanglement creation between the cavity mode and the mechanical modes, but also improves the immunity of the optomechanical entanglement to the thermal excitations by about three orders of magnitude. We also study the optomechanical entanglement in the network-coupled optomechanical system consisting of two mechanical modes and two cavity modes. By analyzing the correspondence between the optomechanical entanglement and the dark-mode effect, we find that optomechanical entanglement can be largely enhanced once the dark mode is broken. In addition, we study the mechanical entanglement and find that it is negligibly small. We also present some discussions on the experimental implementation with a microwave optomechanical setup, on the relationship between the dark-mode-breaking mechanism and the center-of-mass and relative coordinates, and on the explanation of the important role of the dark-mode breaking in the enhancement of optomechanical entanglement. Our results pave the way towards the preparation of entangled optomechanical networks and noise-resistant quantum resources.

TI SPICE compact model of controlling electrons of spin qubits using FinFET
SO JAPANESE JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYSICS
AB Semiconductor qubits have garnered attention in the field of device physics. Owing to the limited coherence of electrons and holes, smaller and more compact qubits are desirable. This requirement is aligned with the miniaturization of conventional transistors. In this study, we consider a compact spin qubit based on the FinFET (Fin Field-Effect Transistor) by using the SPICE (Simulation Program with Integrated Circuit Emphasis) simulator. The qubits are represented by the quantum dots (QDs) between the Fin structure. In order to setup the qubit, we have to control the number of electrons through the FinFET. Here, we consider the circuit model of our system by treating the transport properties of the QD and the FinFET as single-electron phenomena. We provide the SPICE simulation results and show the single-electron current as the functions of the FinFET parameters such as the channel length and width including the operation temperature.

AB Simulating quantum many-body systems is a key application for emerging quantum processors. While analog quantum simulation has already demonstrated quantum advantage, its digital counterpart has recently become the focus of intense research interest due to the availability of devices that aim to realize general-purpose quantum computers. In this perspective, we give a selective overview of the currently pursued approaches, review the advances in digital quantum simulation by comparing non-variational with variational approaches and identify hardware and algorithmic challenges. Based on this review, the question arises: What are the most promising problems that can be tackled with digital quantum simulation? We argue that problems of a qualitative nature are much more suitable for near-term devices then approaches aiming purely for a quantitative accuracy improvement.

TI Machine-learning engineering of quantum currents
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB The design, accurate preparation, and manipulation of quantum states in quantum circuits are essential operational tasks at the heart of quantum technologies. Nowadays, circuits can be designed with physical parameters that can be controlled with unprecedented accuracy and flexibility. However, the generation of well-controlled current states is still a nagging bottleneck, especially when different circuit elements are integrated together. In this work, we show how machine learning can effectively address this challenge and outperform the current existing methods. To this end, we exploit deep reinforcement learning to prepare prescribed quantum current states in circuits composed of lumped elements. To highlight our method, we show how to engineer bosonic persistent currents as they are relevant in different quantum technologies as cold atoms and superconducting circuits. We demonstrate the use of deep reinforcement learning to rediscover established protocols, as well as solving configurations that are difficult to treat with other methods. With our approach, quantum current states characterized by a single winding number or entangled currents of multiple winding numbers can be prepared in a robust manner, superseding the existing protocols.

Assuming fully connected logical qubits and comparable quantum clock speed, QTG offers perspectives for runtimes competitive to classical state-of-the-art knapsack solvers for instances with only 100 variables. (2) By introducing a new technique that exploits logging data from a classical solver, we can predict the runtime of our method way beyond the range of existing quantum platforms and simulators, for benchmark instances with up to 600 variables. Under the given assumptions, we demonstrate the QTG's potential practical quantum advantage for such instances, indicating the promise of an effective approach for hard combinatorial optimisation problems.

TI IQGO: Iterative Quantum Gate Optimiser for Quantum Data Embedding
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB Quantum kernel methods and Variational Quantum Classifiers (VQCs) have recently gained significant interest in the field of Machine Learning (ML). They have the potential to achieve superior generalisation whilst using smaller datasets and fewer parameters compared to their classical counterparts. However, kernel methods which leverage feature map embedding, often struggle with overfitting, which compromises their generalisation performance on unseen data. VQCs which utilise Parameterised Quantum Circuits (PQCs) to model the relationship between input data and the output, are susceptible to the Barren Plateau (BP) problem. To address these challenges, we introduce an adaptive quantum embedding optimisation algorithm, namely the Iterative Quantum Gate Optimiser (IQGO), which is suited to the task of tabular data classification. IQGO employs a Greedy Search algorithm to optimise the quantum embedding. Empirical evidence on noiseless simulations show that it addresses both the overfitting and the BP problem. We demonstrate the efficacy of IQGO on simulations of 21 qubits for the quantum kernel and 4 qubits for the VQC. Using small tabular datasets, we benchmark our approach against contemporary state-of-the-art classical algorithms. These promising results suggest that quantum algorithms may perform well at data classification problems. We test 5 binary classification problems and show that in 3 of them the IQGO algorithm admits competitive or better performance in terms of generalisation than existing state-of-the-art algorithms.

TI Heisenberg-Limited Adaptive Gradient Estimation for Multiple Observables
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB In quantum mechanics, measuring the expectation value of a general observable has an inherent statistical uncertainty that is quantified by variance or mean squared error of measurement outcome. While the uncertainty can be reduced by averaging several samples, the number of samples should be minimized when each sample is very costly. This is especially the case for fault-tolerant quantum computing that involves measurement of multiple observables of nontrivial states in large quantum systems that exceed the capabilities of classical computers. In this work, we provide an adaptive quantum algorithm for estimating the expectation values of M general observables within root mean squared error epsilon simultaneously, using O(epsilon(-1)root MlogM) queries to a state preparation oracle of a target state. This remarkably achieves the scaling of Heisenberg limit 1/epsilon, a fundamental bound on the estimation precision in terms of mean squared error, together with the sublinear scaling of the number of observables M. The proposed method is an adaptive version of the quantum gradient-estimation algorithm and has a resource-efficient implementation due to its adaptiveness. Specifically, the space overhead in the proposed method is O(M), which is independent from the estimation precision epsilon unlike noniterative algorithms. In addition, our method can avoid the numerical instability problem for constructing quantum circuits in a large-scale task (e.g., epsilon << 1 in our case), which appears in the actual implementation of many algorithms relying on quantum signal processing techniques. Our method paves a new way to precisely understand and predict various physical properties in complicated quantum systems using quantum computers.

TI Molecular vibrational polariton: Its dynamics and potentials in novel
   chemistry and quantum technology
SO JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL PHYSICS
AB Molecular vibrational polaritons, a hybridized quasiparticle formed by the strong coupling between molecular vibrational modes and photon cavity modes, have attracted tremendous attention in the chemical physics community due to their peculiar influence on chemical reactions. At the same time, the half-photon half-matter characteristics of polaritons make them suitable to possess properties from both sides and lead to new features that are useful for photonic and quantum technology applications. To eventually use polaritons for chemical and quantum applications, it is critical to understand their dynamics. Due to the intrinsic time scale of cavity modes and molecular vibrational modes in condensed phases, polaritons can experience dynamics on ultrafast time scales, e.g., relaxation from polaritons to dark modes. Thus, ultrafast vibrational spectroscopy becomes an ideal tool to investigate such dynamics. In this Perspective, we give an overview of recent ultrafast spectroscopic works by our group and others in the field. These recent works show that molecular vibrational polaritons can have distinct dynamics from its pure molecular counterparts, such as intermolecular vibrational energy transfer and hot vibrational dynamics. We then discuss some current challenges and future opportunities, such as the possible use of ultrafast vibrational dynamics, to understand cavity-modified reactions and routes to develop molecular vibrational polaritons as new room temperature quantum platforms.

TI Path toward manufacturable superconducting qubits with relaxation times
   exceeding 0.1 ms
SO NPJ QUANTUM INFORMATION
AB As the superconducting qubit platform matures towards ever-larger scales in the race towards a practical quantum computer, limitations due to qubit inhomogeneity through lack of process control become apparent. To benefit from the advanced process control in industry-scale CMOS fabrication facilities, different processing methods will be required. In particular, the double-angle evaporation and lift-off techniques used for current, state-of-the-art superconducting qubits are generally incompatible with modern-day manufacturable processes. Here, we demonstrate a fully CMOS compatible qubit fabrication method, and show results from overlap Josephson junction devices with long coherence and relaxation times, on par with the state-of-the-art. We experimentally verify that Argon milling-the critical step during junction fabrication-and a subtractive-etch process nevertheless result in qubits with average qubit energy relaxation times T-1 reaching 70 mu s, with maximum values exceeding 100 mu s. Furthermore, we show that our results are still limited by surface losses and not, crucially, by junction losses. The presented fabrication process, therefore, heralds an important milestone towards a manufacturable 300 mm CMOS process for high-coherence superconducting qubits and has the potential to advance the scaling of superconducting device architectures.

TI Analysis of a High-Dimensional Extended B92 Protocol
SO QUANTUM INFORMATION PROCESSING
AB Quantum key distribution (QKD) allows two parties to establish a shared secret key that is secure against adversaries with unlimited computational power. One such protocol named B92 is quite appealing due to its simplicity but is highly sensitive to channel noise. In this work, we investigate a high-dimensional variant of an extended version of the B92 protocol and show that it can distill a key over high noise channels. The protocol we consider requires that Alice sends only three high-dimensional states and Bob only performs partial measurements. We perform an information-theoretic security analysis of our protocol and compare its key rate to that of a high-dimensional BB84 protocol over depolarization and amplitude damping channels.

TI Bell inequality violation in gate-defined quantum dots
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Quantum computers leverage entanglement to achieve superior computational power. However, verifying that the entangled state does not follow the principle of local causality has proven difficult for spin qubits in gate-defined quantum dots, as it requires simultaneously high concurrence values and readout fidelities to break the classical bound imposed by Bell's inequality. While low error rates for state preparation, control, and measurement have been independently demonstrated, a simultaneous demonstration remained challenging. We employ advanced protocols like heralded initialization and calibration via gate set tomography (GST), to push fidelities of the full 2-qubit gate set above 99%, including state preparation and measurement (SPAM). We demonstrate a 97.17% Bell state fidelity without correcting for readout errors and violate Bell's inequality using direct parity readout with a Bell signal of S = 2.731. Our measurements exceed the classical limit even at 1.1 K or entanglement lifetimes of 100 mu s. Violating Bell's inequality in a silicon quantum dot qubit system is a key milestone, as it proves quantum entanglement, fundamental to achieving quantum advantage.

TI Quantum Autoencoder for Enhanced Fraud Detection in Imbalanced Credit
   Card Dataset
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB Credit card fraud detection is crucial for financial security which entails identifying unauthorized transactions that can result in significant financial losses. Detection is inherently challenging due to the rarity and indistinguishability of fraudulent transactions from genuine ones, which makes it an anomaly detection problem. Traditional detection systems struggle with the highly imbalanced nature of transaction datasets, where genuine transactions vastly outnumber fraudulent cases. In response to these challenges, we propose a novel detection model utilizing Quantum AutoEncoders-based Fraud Detection (QAE-FD). Our approach leverages quantum computing principles to enhance anomaly detection capabilities by encoding transaction data into compressed quantum states and optimizing the model against a loss function that evaluates the fidelity in flagging fraudulent transactions. The efficacy of the QAE-FD model is tested on a real-world credit card transaction dataset, achieving a G-mean of 0.946 and an AUC of 0.947 which demonstrates superior performance compared to existing models. Our results indicate that QAE-FD has not only higher accuracy in fraud detection but also better computational efficiency. The integration of quantum autoencoders is a promising advancement in the field of anomaly detection for credit card fraud, addressing the limitations of imbalanced datasets and offering a scalable solution for real-time detection systems.

TI Dephasing of Majorana qubits due to quasistatic disorder
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
AB Quantum bits based on Majorana zero modes are expected to be robust against certain noise types, and hence provide a quantum computing platform that is superior to conventional qubits. This robustness is not complete, though: imperfections can still lead to qubit decoherence and hence to information loss. In this work, we theoretically study Majorana-qubit dephasing in a minimal model: in a Kitaev chain with quasistatic disorder. Our approach, based on numerics as well as first-order nondegenerate perturbation theory, provides a conceptually simple physical picture and predicts Gaussian dephasing. We show that as system parameters are varied, the dephasing rate due to disorder oscillates out-of-phase with respect to the oscillating Majorana splitting of the clean system. In our model, first-order dephasing sweet spots are absent if disorder is uncorrelated. We describe the crossover between uncorrelated and highly correlated disorder, and show that dephasing measurements can be used to characterize the disorder correlation length. We expect that our results will be utilized for the design and interpretation of future Majorana-qubit experiments.

TI Measuring the evolution of entanglement in Compton scattering
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB The evolution of the entanglement measure during Compton scattering is studied. Our analytical results show that the corresponding measure coincides with the concurrence of the two-qubit state arising after scattering. The state never collapses to a separable one, contrary to what was previously assumed. The behavior of quantum entanglement during scattering is identical to the behavior of initially classically correlated photons up to a constant factor equal to two. This is consistent with local quantum field theory, and "spooky action at a distance" is not required to explain the change in state of nonlocally entangled qubits during the measurement of one of them. Our dedicated experiment with annihilation photons confirms these results and explains the "Puzzle of Decoherence" observed recently.

TI Entanglement Robustness via Spatial Deformation of Identical Particle
   Wave Functions
SO ENTROPY
AB We address the problem of entanglement protection against surrounding noise by a procedure suitably exploiting spatial indistinguishability of identical subsystems. To this purpose, we take two initially separated and entangled identical qubits interacting with two independent noisy environments. Three typical models of environments are considered: amplitude damping channel, phase damping channel and depolarizing channel. After the interaction, we deform the wave functions of the two qubits to make them spatially overlap before performing spatially localized operations and classical communication (sLOCC) and eventually computing the entanglement of the resulting state. This way, we show that spatial indistinguishability of identical qubits can be utilized within the sLOCC operational framework to partially recover the quantum correlations spoiled by the environment. A general behavior emerges: the higher the spatial indistinguishability achieved via deformation, the larger the amount of recovered entanglement.

TI Theoretical studies on quantum imaging with time-integrated
   single-photon detection under realistic experimental conditions
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB We study a quantum-enhanced differential measurement scheme that uses quantum probes and single-photon detectors to measure a minute defect in the absorption parameter of an analyte under investigation. For the purpose, we consider two typical non-classical states of light as a probe, a twin-Fock state and a two-mode squeezed vacuum state. Their signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) that quantifies the capability of detecting the defect are compared with a corresponding classical imaging scheme that employs a coherent state input. A quantitative comparison is made in terms of typical system imperfections such as photon loss and background noise that are common in practice. It is shown that a quantum enhancement in SNR can be described generally by the Mandel Q-parameter and the noise-reduction-factor, which characterize an input state that is incident to the analyte. We thereby identify the conditions under which the quantum enhancement remains and can be further increased. We expect our study to provide a guideline for improving the SNR in quantum imaging experiments employing a differential measurement scheme with time-integrated single-photon detectors.

We explore the relationship between quantum imaginarity and the quantum speed limit by utilizing measures such as relative entropy, trace distance, and geometric imaginarity. These speed limits define the fundamental constraints on the minimum time necessary for quantum systems to evolve under various dynamical processes. As applications, the dephasing dynamics and dissipative dynamics are analyzed in detail. The quantum speed limit in stochasticapproximate transformations is also investigated. Our quantum speed limits provide lower bounds on how fast a physical system evolves to attain or lose certain imaginarity, with potential applications in efficient quantum computation designs, quantum control, and quantum sensing.

To achieve high-speed QKD, tailored tech-niques are developed and employed to quickly generate and detect quantum states. However, these techniques may introduce unique loopholes to compromise the security of QKD systems. In this paper, we investigate the loopholes of the self-differencing (SD) avalanche photodiode (APD) detector, typically used for high-speed detection in a QKD system, and demonstrate experimental testing of the SD APD detector under strong-pulse -illumination attack. This attack presents blinding stability and helps an eavesdropper to learn the secret key without introducing extra quantum bit rate error. Based on this testing, we propose a set of criteria for protecting SD APD detectors from the strong-pulse-illumination attack.

TI Efficient spectrum analysis for multi-junction superconducting circuit
SO PHYSICA SCRIPTA
AB The extraction of transition frequencies from a spectrum has conventionally relied on empirical methods, and particularly in complex systems, it is a time-consuming and cumbersome process. To address this challenge, we establish a semi-automated efficient and precise spectrum analysis method. It first employs image processing methods to extract transition frequencies, subsequently estimating the Hamiltonians of a superconducting quantum circuit containing multiple Josephson junctions. In addition, we determine the suitable range of approximations in simulation methods, evaluating the physical reliability of the analysis.

TI Identification of Soft Modes in Amorphous Al2O3
   via First-Principles
SO ADVANCED QUANTUM TECHNOLOGIES
AB Amorphous Al2O3 is a fundamental component of modern superconducting qubits. While amorphous oxides offer distinct advantages, such as directional isotropy and a consistent bulk electronic gap, in realistic systems these compounds also support two-level systems (TLSs) which couple to the qubit, expediting decoherence. In this work, a first-principles study of amorphous Al2O3 is performed and low-energy modes are identified in the electronic and vibrational spectra as a possible origin for TLSs.

TI A note on uncertainty relations of metric-adjusted skew information
SO QUANTUM INFORMATION PROCESSING
AB The uncertainty principle is one of the fundamental features of quantum mechanics and plays a vital role in quantum information processing. We study uncertainty relations based on metric-adjusted skew information for finite quantum observables. Motivated by the paper [Physical Review A 104, 052414 (2021)], we establish tighter uncertainty relations in terms of different norm inequalities. Naturally, we generalize the method to uncertainty relations of metric-adjusted skew information for quantum channels and unitary operators. As both the Wigner-Yanase-Dyson skew information and the quantum Fisher information are the special cases of the metric-adjusted skew information corresponding to different Morozova-Chentsov functions, our results generalize some existing uncertainty relations. Detailed examples are given to illustrate the advantages of our methods.

TI Nonreciprocal Frequency Domain Beam Splitter
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB The canonical beam splitter-a fundamental building block of quantum optical systems-is a reciprocal element. It operates on forward- and backward-propagating modes in the same way, regardless of direction. The concept of nonreciprocal quantum photonic operations, by contrast, could be used to transform quantum states in a momentum- and direction-selective fashion. Here we demonstrate the basis for such a nonreciprocal transformation in the frequency domain through intermodal Bragg scattering four-wave mixing (BSFWM). Since the total number of idler and signal photons is conserved, the process can preserve coherence of quantum optical states, functioning as a nonreciprocal frequency beam splitter. We explore the origin of this nonreciprocity and find that the phase-matching requirements of intermodal BSFWM produce an enormous asymmetry (76x) in the conversion bandwidths for forward and backward configurations, yielding similar to 25 dB of nonreciprocal contrast over several hundred GHz. We also outline how the demonstrated efficiencies (similar to 10(-4)) may be scaled to near-unity values with readily accessible powers and pumping configurations for applications in integrated quantum photonics.

TI Composable security analysis of linear optics cloning machine improved
   discretized polar modulation continuous-variable quantum key
   distribution
SO ACTA PHYSICA SINICA
AB In experimental setups of continuous-variable quantum key distribution (CVQKD) independently modulating the amplitude and phase of coherent states, the ideal Gaussian modulation will be degraded into discretized polar modulation (DPM) due to the finite resolution of the driving voltages of electro-optical modulators. To compensate for the performance degradation induced by the joint effect of amplitude and phase discretization, linear optics cloning machine (LOCM) can be introduced on the receiver side. Implemented by linear optical elements, heterodyne detection and controlled displacement, LOCM introduces extra noise that can be transformed into an advantageous one to combat channel excess noise by dynamically adjusting the relevant parameters into a suitable range. In this paper, the prepare-and-measure version of LOCM DPMCVQKD is presented, where the incoming signal state enters a tunable LOCM before being measured by the nonideal heterodyne detector. The equivalent entanglement-based model is also established to perform security analysis, where the LOCM is reformulated into combination of the incoming signal state and a thermal state on a beam splitter. The composable secret key rate is derived to investigate the security of LOCM DPM-CVQKD. Simulation results demonstrate that the composable secret key rate and transmission distance are closely related to the tuning gain and the transmittance of LOCM. Once these two parameters are set to appropriate values, LOCM can improve the secret key rate and transmission distance of DPM-CVQKD, as well as its resistance to excess noise. Meanwhile, taking finite-size effect into consideration, the LOCM can also effectively reduce the requirement for the block size of the exchanged signals, which is beneficial to the feasibility and practicability of CVQKD. Owing to the fact that the performance of LOCM DPM-CVQKD is largely reliant on the calibration selection of relevant parameters, further research may concentrate on the optimization of LOCM in experimental implementations, where machine learning related methods may be utilized.

TI Role of Quantum Information in HEOM Trajectories
SO JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL THEORY AND COMPUTATION
AB Open quantum systems often operate in the non-Markovian regime where a finite history of a trajectory is intrinsic to its evolution. The degree of non-Markovianity for a trajectory may be measured in terms of the amount of information flowing from the bath back into the system. In this study, we consider how information flows through the auxiliary density operators (ADOs) in the hierarchical equations of motion. We consider three cases for a range of baths, underdamped, intermediate, and overdamped. By understanding how information flows, we are able to determine the relative importance of different ADOs within the hierarchy. We show that ADOs sharing a common Matsubara axis behave similarly, while ADOs on different Matsubara axes behave differently. Using this knowledge, we are able to truncate hierarchies significantly, thus reducing the computation time, while obtaining qualitatively similar results. This is illustrated by comparing 2D electronic spectra for a molecule with an underdamped vibration subsumed into the bath spectral density.

TI An FPGA-Based LDPC Decoder With Ultra-Long Codes for Continuous-Variable
   Quantum Key Distribution
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB In this paper, we propose a good decoding performance, low-complexity, and high-speed decoder architecture for ultra-long quasi-cyclic LDPC codes by using the layered sum-product decoding scheme. To reduce implementation complexity and hardware resource consumption, the messages in the iteration process are uniformly quantified and the function ''(x) is approximated with second-order functions. The decoder architecture improves the decoding throughput by using partial parallel and pipeline structures. A modified construction method of parity check matrices was applied to prevent read&write conflicts and achieve high-speed pipeline structure. The simulation results show that our decoder architecture has good performance at signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) as low as -0.6 dB. We have implemented our decoder architecture on a Virtex-7 XC7VX690T field programmable gate array (FPGA) device. The implementation results show that the FPGA-based LDPC decoder can achieve throughputs of 108.64 Mb/s and 70.32 Mb/s at SNR of 1.0 dB when the code length is 262,144 and 349,952, respectively. The decoder can find useful applications in those scenarios that require very low SNRs and high throughputs, such as the information reconciliation of continuous-variable quantum key distribution.

TI Leveraging Hamiltonian simulation techniques to compile operations on
   bosonic devices
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICS A-MATHEMATICAL AND THEORETICAL
AB Circuit quantum electrodynamics enables the combined use of qubits and oscillator modes. Despite a variety of available gate sets, many hybrid qubit-boson (i.e. qubit-oscillator) operations are realizable only through optimal control theory, which is oftentimes intractable and uninterpretable. We introduce an analytic approach with rigorously proven error bounds for realizing specific classes of operations via two matrix product formulas commonly used in Hamiltonian simulation, the Lie-Trotter-Suzuki and Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff product formulas. We show how this technique can be used to realize a number of operations of interest, including polynomials of annihilation and creation operators, namely (a)p(a dagger)q for integer p,q. We show examples of this paradigm including obtaining universal control within a subspace of the entire Fock space of an oscillator, state preparation of a fixed photon number in the cavity, simulation of the Jaynes-Cummings Hamiltonian, and simulation of the Hong-Ou-Mandel effect. This work demonstrates how techniques from Hamiltonian simulation can be applied to better control hybrid qubit-boson devices.

TI First-principles theory of extending the spin qubit coherence time in
   hexagonal boron nitride
SO NPJ 2D MATERIALS AND APPLICATIONS
AB Negatively charged boron vacancies (V-B(-)) in hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) are a rapidly developing qubit platform in two-dimensional materials for solid-state quantum applications. However, their spin coherence time (T-2) is very short, limited to a few microseconds owing to the inherently dense nuclear spin bath of the h-BN host. As the coherence time is one of the most fundamental properties of spin qubits, the short T-2 time of V(B)(- )could significantly limit its potential as a promising spin qubit candidate. In this study, we theoretically proposed two materials engineering methods, which can substantially extend the T-2 time of the V-B(-) spin by four times more than its intrinsic T-2. We performed quantum many-body computations by combining density functional theory and cluster correlation expansion and showed that replacing all the boron atoms in h-BN with the B-10 isotope leads to the coherence enhancement of the V-B(-) spin by a factor of three. In addition, the T-2 time of the V-B(-) can be enhanced by a factor of 1.3 by inducing a curvature around V-B(-) Herein, we elucidate that the curvature-induced inhomogeneous strain creates spatially varying quadrupole nuclear interactions, which effectively suppress the nuclear spin flip-flop dynamics in the bath. Importantly, we find that the combination of isotopic enrichment and strain engineering can maximize the T-2 time of V-B(-) , yielding 207.2 mu s and 161.9 mu s for single- and multi-layer h-(BN)-B-10, respectively. Furthermore, our results can be applied to any spin qubit in h-BN, strengthening their potential as material platforms to realize high-precision quantum sensors, quantum spin registers, and atomically thin quantum magnets.

TI Quantum correlations and metrological advantage among Unruh-DeWitt
   detectors in de Sitter spacetime
SO EUROPEAN PHYSICAL JOURNAL C
AB A long-standing debate on Gibbons-Hawking (GH) decoherence centers on its obscure thermal nature. In this work, we investigate the robustness of quantum Fisher information (QFI) and local quantum uncertainty (LQU) in the presence of GH decoherence, using free-falling Unruh-DeWitt (UDW) detectors in de Sitter spacetime (dS-ST). The UDW detectors interact with a massless scalar field in dS-ST and are modeled as open quantum systems, with the field serving as the environment, described by a master equation that outlines their evolution. Our analysis investigates the roles of energy spacing, GH temperature, initial state preparation, and various de Sitter-invariant vacuum sectors on the optimization of QFI and LQU. We find that the optimal values of QFI and LQU depend on the selected de Sitter-invariant vacuum sector and increase with larger energy spacing. Our findings reveal that QFI exhibits resilience to GH decoherence, maintaining a pronounced local peak across a broader range of parameters. This robustness can be further enhanced through strategic initial state preparation and increased energy spacing, resulting in a higher maximum QFI value even under significant environmental decoherence. Our results underscore the critical role of GH thermality in governing QFI and LQU, offering valuable insights for advances in relativistic quantum metrology (RQM).

TI Quantum computations for disambiguation and question answering
SO QUANTUM INFORMATION PROCESSING
AB Automatic text processing is now a mature discipline in computer science, and so attempts at advancements using quantum computation have emerged as the new frontier, often under the term of quantum natural language processing. The main challenges consist in finding the most adequate ways of encoding words and their interactions on a quantum computer, considering hardware constraints, as well as building algorithms that take advantage of quantum architectures, so as to show improvement on the performance of natural language tasks. In this paper, we introduce a new framework that starts from a grammar that can be interpreted by means of tensor contraction, to build word representations as quantum states that serve as input to a quantum algorithm. We start by introducing an operator measurement to contract the representations of words, resulting in the representation of larger fragments of text. We then go on to develop pipelines for the tasks of sentence meaning disambiguation and question answering that take advantage of quantum features. For the first task, we show that our contraction scheme deals with syntactically ambiguous phrases storing the various different meanings in quantum superposition, a solution not available on a classical setting. For the second task, we obtain a question representation that contains all possible answers in equal quantum superposition, and we implement Grover's quantum search algorithm to find the correct answer, agnostic to the specific question, an implementation with the potential of delivering a result with quadratic speedup.

TI Generation of entanglement and nonstationary states via competing
   coherent and incoherent bosonic hopping
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Incoherent stochastic processes added to unitary dynamics are typically deemed detrimental since they are expected to diminish quantum features such as superposition and entanglement. Instead of exhibiting energy-conserving persistent coherent motion, the dynamics of such open systems feature, in most cases, a steady state, which is approached in the long-time limit from all initial conditions. This can, in fact, be advantageous as it offers a mechanism for the creation of robust quantum correlations on demand without the need for fine-tuning. Here, we show this for a system consisting of two coherently coupled bosonic modes, which is a paradigmatic scenario for the realization of quantum resources such as squeezed entangled states. Rather counterintuitively, the mere addition of incoherent hopping, which results in a statistical coupling between the bosonic modes, leads to steady states with robust quantum entanglement and enables the emergence of persistent coherent nonstationary behavior.

TI Exploration of Defect Dynamics and Color Center Qubit Synthesis with
   Pulsed Ion Beams
SO QUANTUM BEAM SCIENCE
AB Short-pulse ion beams have been developed in recent years and now enable applications in materials science. A tunable flux of selected ions delivered in pulses of a few nanoseconds can affect the balance of defect formation and dynamic annealing in materials. We report results from color center formation in silicon with pulses of 900 keV protons. G-centers in silicon are near-infrared photon emitters with emerging applications as single-photon sources and for spin-photon qubit integration. G-centers consist of a pair of substitutional carbon atoms and one silicon interstitial atom and are often formed by carbon ion implantation and thermal annealing. Here, we report on G-center formation with proton pulses in silicon samples that already contained carbon, without carbon ion implantation or thermal annealing. The number of G-centers formed per proton increased when we increased the pulse intensity from 6.9 x 10(9) to 7.9 x 10(10) protons/cm(2)/pulse, demonstrating a flux effect on G-center formation efficiency. We observe a G-center ensemble linewidth of 0.1 nm (full width half maximum), narrower than previously reported. Pulsed ion beams can extend the parameter range available for fundamental studies of radiation-induced defects and the formation of color centers for spin-photon qubit applications.

TI Ultra-narrow optical linewidths in rare-earth molecular crystals
SO NATURE
AB Rare-earth ions (REIs) are promising solid-state systems for building light-matter interfaces at the quantum level(1,2). This relies on their potential to show narrow optical and spin homogeneous linewidths, or, equivalently, long-lived quantum states. This enables the use of REIs for photonic quantum technologies such as memories for light, optical-microwave transduction and computing(3-5). However, so far, few crystalline materials have shown an environment quiet enough to fully exploit REI properties. This hinders further progress, in particular towards REI-containing integrated nanophotonics devices(6,7). Molecular systems can provide such capability but generally lack spin states. If, however, molecular systems do have spin states, they show broad optical lines that severely limit optical-to-spin coherent interfacing(8-10). Here we report on europium molecular crystals that exhibit linewidths in the tens of kilohertz range, orders of magnitude narrower than those of other molecular systems. We harness this property to demonstrate efficient optical spin initialization, coherent storage of light using an atomic frequency comb, and optical control of ion-ion interactions towards implementation of quantum gates. These results illustrate the utility of rare-earth molecular crystals as a new platform for photonic quantum technologies that combines highly coherent emitters with the unmatched versatility in composition, structure and integration capability of molecular materials.

TI Information Theoretically Secure Data Relay Using QKD Network
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB For information that requires long-term confidentiality (e.g. national security, military security, genomic data etc.), the threat of eavesdropping must be seriously considered. The leakage of such information would not only cause temporary confusion but would also have serious repercussions for future generations. Part of such important data are already being exchanged over the Internet using cryptography that is not resistant to quantum computers. Considering the possibility of harvest attacks on information that must be kept secret for centuries, developing a technology that can immediately eliminate the risk of eavesdropping in principle is desirable. In response to these demands, we previously developed a system called the quantum secure cloud, which realizes an information-theoretically secure data transmission, storage, reconstruction, and authentication with a single password, using an established technology of quantum key distribution network. We now apply this technology to develop an information-theoretically secure long-distance data-relay function and succeed in developing a distributed data-relay simulator that is compatible with current quantum key distribution networks. The throughput of this protocol is more than 10 Mbps for 10 MB data, so it can be applied to practical use.

TI Qubit Regularization of Asymptotic Freedom
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB We provide strong evidence that the asymptotically free (1 + 1)-dimensional nonlinear O(3) sigma model can be regularized using a quantum lattice Hamiltonian, referred to as the "Heisenberg comb," that acts on a Hilbert space with only two qubits per spatial lattice site. The Heisenberg comb consists of a spin-half antiferromagnetic Heisenberg chain coupled antiferromagnetically to a second local spin-half particle at every lattice site. Using a world-line Monte Carlo method, we show that the model reproduces the universal step-scaling function of the traditional model up to correlation lengths of 200000 in lattice units and argue how the continuum limit could emerge. We provide a quantum circuit description of the time evolution of the model and argue that near-term quantum computers may suffice to demonstrate asymptotic freedom.

TI Near term algorithms for linear systems of equations
SO QUANTUM INFORMATION PROCESSING
AB Finding solutions to systems of linear equations is a common problem in many areas of science and engineering, with much potential for a speed up on quantum devices. While the Harrow-Hassidim-Lloyd (HHL) quantum algorithm yields up to an exponential speed up over classical algorithms in some cases, it requires a fault-tolerant quantum computer, which is unlikely to be available in the near-term. Thus, attention has turned to the investigation of quantum algorithms for noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices where several near-term approaches to solving systems of linear equations have been proposed. This paper focuses on the Variational Quantum Linear Solvers (VQLS), and other closely related methods and adaptions. Several contributions are made in this paper, which include: the first application of the Evolutionary Ansatz to the VQLS (EAVQLS), the first implementation of the Logical Ansatz VQLS (LAVQLS), based on the Classical Combination of Quantum States (CQS) method, a proof of principle demonstration of the CQS method on real quantum hardware and a method for the implementation of the Adiabatic Ansatz on the VQLS (AAVQLS). These approaches are implemented and contrasted. The CQS method is run with moderate success on a real quantum device. The EAVQLS and AAVQLS show promise as possible improvements to the standard VQLS algorithm once refined.

TI Master equation emulation and coherence preservation with classical
   control of a superconducting qubit
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Open quantum systems are a topic of intense theoretical research. The use of master equations to model a system's evolution subject to an interaction with an external environment is one of the most successful theoretical paradigms. General experimental tools to study different open system realizations have been limited, and so it is highly desirable to develop experimental tools which emulate diverse master equation dynamics and give a way to test open systems theories. In this paper we demonstrate a systematic method for engineering specific system-environment interactions and emulating master equations of a particular form using classical stochastic noise in a superconducting transmon qubit. We also demonstrate that non-Markovian noise can be used as a resource to extend the coherence of a quantum system and counteract the adversarial effects of Markovian environments.

TI Matchgate Shadows for Fermionic Quantum Simulation
SO COMMUNICATIONS IN MATHEMATICAL PHYSICS
AB "Classical shadows" are estimators of an unknown quantum state, constructed from suitably distributed random measurements on copies of that state (Huang et al. in Nat Phys 16:1050, 2020, https:// doi.org/10.1038/ s41567-020-0932- 7). In this paper, we analyze classical shadows obtained using random matchgate circuits, which correspond to fermionic Gaussian unitaries. We prove that the first three moments of the Haar distribution over the continuous group of matchgate circuits are equal to those of the discrete uniform distribution over only the matchgate circuits that are also Clifford unitaries; thus, the latter forms a "matchgate 3-design." This implies that the classical shadows resulting from the two ensembles are functionally equivalent. We show how one can use these matchgate shadows to efficiently estimate inner products between an arbitrary quantum state and fermionic Gaussian states, as well as the expectation values of local fermionic operators and various other quantities, thus surpassing the capabilities of prior work. As a concrete application, this enables us to apply wavefunction constraints that control the fermion sign problem in the quantum-classical auxiliary-field quantum Monte Carlo algorithm (QC-AFQMC) (Huggins et al. inNature 603:416, 2022, https:// doi.org/10.1038/ s41586-021- 04351- z), without the exponential post-processing cost incurred by the original approach.

TI Schmidt rank constraints in quantum information theory
SO LETTERS IN MATHEMATICAL PHYSICS
AB Can vectors with low Schmidt rank form mutually unbiased bases? Can vectors with high Schmidt rank form positive under partial transpose states? In this work, we address these questions by presenting several new results related to Schmidt rank constraints and their compatibility with other properties. We provide an upper bound on the number of mutually unbiased bases of C-m circle times C-n (m <= n) formed by vectors with low Schmidt rank. In particular, the number of mutually unbiased product bases of C-m circle times C-n cannot exceed m + 1, which solves a conjecture proposed by McNulty et al. Then, we show how to create a positive under partial transpose entangled state from any state supported on the antisymmetric space and how their Schmidt numbers are exactly related. Finally, we show that the Schmidt number of operator Schmidt rank 3 states of M-m circle times M-n (m <= n) that are invariant under left partial transpose cannot exceed m - 2.

TI Substrate-controlled dynamics of spin qubits in low dimensional van der
   Waals materials
SO APPLIED PHYSICS LETTERS
AB We report a theoretical study of the coherence dynamics of spin qubits in two-dimensional materials (2DMs) and van der Waals heterostructures, as a function of the host thickness and the composition of the surrounding environment. We focus on MoS2 and WS2, two promising systems for quantum technology applications, and we consider the decoherence arising from the interaction of the spin qubit with nuclear spins. We show that the Hahn-echo coherence time is determined by a complex interplay between the source of decoherence in the qubit host and in the environment, which in turn determines whether the noise evolution is in a classical or quantum mechanical regime. We suggest that the composition and thickness of van der Waals heterostructures encapsulating a qubit host can be engineered to maximize coherence times. Finally, we discuss how quantum sensors may be able to probe the dynamics of the nuclear bath in 2DMs.

TI The Controllability of Quantum Correlation under Geometry and Entropy
   Discords
SO CMC-COMPUTERS MATERIALS & CONTINUA
AB Quantum correlation plays a critical role in the maintenance of quantum information processing and nanometer device design. In the past two decades, several quantitative methods had been proposed to study the quantum correlation of certain open quantum systems, including the geometry and entropy style discord methods. However, there are differences among these quantification methods, which promote a deep understanding of the quantum correlation. In this paper, a novel time-dependent three environ mental open system model is established to study the quantum correlation. This system model interacts with two independent spin-environments (two spin-environments are connected to the other spin-environment) respectively. We have calculated and compared the changing properties of the quantum correlation under three kinds of geometry and two entropy discords, especially for the freezing phenomenon. At the same time, some original and novel changing behaviors of the quantum correlation under different timedependent parameters are studied, which is helpful to achieve the optimal revival of the quantum discord and the similar serrated form of the freezing phenomenon. Finally, it shows the controllability of the freezing correlation and the robustness of these methods by adjusting time-dependent parameters. This work provides a new way to control the quantum correlation and design nanospintronic devices.

TI Pilot-reference-free continuous-variable quantum key distribution with
   efficient decoy-state analysis
SO PHOTONICS RESEARCH
AB Continuous-variable quantum key distribution (CV QKD) using optical coherent detectors is practically favorable due to its low implementation cost, flexibility of wavelength division multiplexing, and compatibility with standard coherent communication technologies. However, the security analysis and parameter estimation of CV QKD are complicated due to the infinite-dimensional latent Hilbert space. Also, the transmission of strong reference pulses undermines the security and complicates the experiments. In this work, we tackle these two problems by presenting a time-bin-encoding CV protocol with a simple phase-error-based security analysis valid under general coherent attacks. With the key encoded into the relative intensity between two optical modes, the need for global references is removed. Furthermore, phase randomization can be introduced to decouple the security analysis of different photon-number components. We can hence tag the photon number for each round, effectively estimate the associated privacy using a carefully designed coherent-detection method, and independently extract encryption keys from each component. Simulations manifest that the protocol using multi-photon components increases the key rate by two orders of magnitude compared to the one using only the single-photon component. Meanwhile, the protocol with four-intensity decoy analysis is sufficient to yield tight parameter estimation with a short-distance key-rate performance comparable to the best Bennett-Brassard-1984 implementation.

TI Quantum scrambling with classical shadows
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Quantum dynamics is of fundamental interest and has implications in quantum information processing. The four-point out-of-time-ordered correlator (OTOC) is traditionally used to quantify quantum information scrambling under many-body dynamics. Due to the OTOC's unusual time ordering, its measurement is challenging. We propose higher-point OTOCs to reveal early-time scrambling behavior, and present protocols to measure any higher-point OTOC using the shadow estimation method. The protocols circumvent the need for time-reversal evolution and ancillary control. They can be implemented in near-term quantum devices with single-qubit readout.

TI Making Trotterization Adaptive and Energy-Self-Correcting for NISQ
   Devices and Beyond
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB Simulation of continuous-time evolution requires time discretization on both classical and quantum computers. A finer time step improves simulation precision but it inevitably leads to increased computa-tional efforts. This is particularly costly for today's noisy intermediate-scale quantum computers, where notable gate imperfections limit the circuit depth that can be executed at a given accuracy. Classical adap-tive solvers are well developed to save numerical computation times. However, it remains an outstanding challenge to make optimal usage of the available quantum resources by means of adaptive time steps. Here, we introduce a quantum algorithm to solve this problem, providing a controlled solution of the quantum many-body dynamics of local observables. The key conceptual element of our algorithm is a feedback loop that self-corrects the simulation errors by adapting time steps, thereby significantly out-performing conventional Trotter schemes on a fundamental level and reducing the circuit depth. It even allows for a controlled asymptotic long-time error, where the usual Trotterized dynamics faces difficulties. Another key advantage of our quantum algorithm is that any desired conservation law can be included in the self-correcting feedback loop, which has a potentially wide range of applicability. We demonstrate the capabilities by enforcing gauge invariance, which is crucial for a faithful and long-sought-after quantum simulation of lattice gauge theories. Our algorithm can potentially be useful on a more general level when-ever time discretization is involved also concerning, e.g., numerical approaches based on time-evolving block-decimation methods.

TI Quantum delocalization, gauge, and quantum optics: Light-matter
   interaction in relativistic quantum information
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB We revisit the interaction of a first-quantized atomic system (consisting of two charged quantum particles) with the quantum electromagnetic field, pointing out the subtleties related to the gauge nature of electromagnetism and the effect of multipole approximations. We connect the full minimal-coupling model with the typical effective models used in quantum optics and relativistic quantum information such as the Unruh-DeWitt (UDW) model and the dipole coupling approximation. We point out in what regimes different degrees of approximation are reasonable and in what cases effective models need to be refined to capture the features of the light-matter interaction. This is particularly important when considering the center of mass (COM) of the atom as a quantum system that can be delocalized over multiple trajectories. For example, we show that the simplest UDW approximation with a quantum COM fails to capture crucial Rontgen terms coupling COM and internal atomic degrees of freedom with each other and the field. Finally we show how effective dipole interaction models can be covariantly prescribed for relativistically moving atoms.

TI Dynamics of quantum resources in regular and Majorana fermion systems
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB In recent years, the reassessment of quantum physical phenomena under the framework of resource theories has triggered the design of novel quantum technologies that take advantage from quantum resources, such as entanglement and quantum coherence. Bearing this in mind, in this work we study the dynamics of quantum resources for two solid-state fermionic quantum devices: (i) a system composed by a pair of Majorana fermions and (ii) another comprising a pair of regular fermions. In both systems, the fermionic species are coupled to a single-level quantum dot. From the interaction of these tripartite systems with a dissipative reservoir, we were able to characterize the dynamics of the devices for some initial states. By employing a time-nonlocal masterequation approach, we obtain the evolution for fermionic occupations, quantum correlations, and quantum coherences in both the Markovian and non-Markovian dissipating regimes. We investigate the interconversion of local coherence and bipartite correlations for the marginal states in each device. While the dynamics of the entanglement and quantum coherence depend quite strongly on the temperature of the reservoir for regular fermions, we found these evolutions are qualitatively similar for the case of Majorana bound states regardless of temperature. Our results illustrate the use of quantum information-theoretic measures to characterize the role of quantum resources in fermion systems.

TI Out-of-equilibrium steady states of a locally driven lossy qubit array
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB We find a rich variety of counterintuitive features in the steady states of a qubit array coupled to a dissipative source and sink at two arbitrary sites, using a master equation approach. We show there are setups where increasing the pump and loss rates establishes long-range coherence. At sufficiently strong dissipation, the source or sink effectively generates correlation between its neighboring sites, leading to a striking density-wave order for a class of "resonant" geometries. This effect can be used more widely to engineer nonequilibrium phases. We show the steady states are generically distinct for hard-core bosons and free fermions, and differ significantly from the ones found before in special cases. They are explained by generally applicable ansatzes for the long-time dynamics at weak and strong dissipation. Our findings are relevant for existing photonic setups.

TI Optimal storage capacity of quantum Hopfield neural networks
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Quantum neural networks form one pillar of the emergent field of quantum machine learning. Here quantum generalizations of classical networks realizing associative memories-capable of retrieving patterns, or memories, from corrupted initial states-have been proposed. It is a challenging open problem to analyze quantum associative memories with an extensive number of patterns and to determine the maximal number of patterns the quantum networks can reliably store, i.e., their storage capacity. In this work, we propose and explore a general method for evaluating the maximal storage capacity of quantum neural network models. By generalizing what is known as Gardner's approach in the classical realm, we exploit the theory of classical spin glasses for deriving the optimal storage capacity of quantum networks with quenched pattern variables. As an example, we apply our method to an open-system quantum associative memory formed of interacting spin-1/2 particles realizing coupled artificial neurons. The system undergoes a Markovian time evolution resulting from a dissipative retrieval dynamics that competes with a coherent quantum dynamics. We map out the nonequilibrium phase diagram and study the effect of temperature and Hamiltonian dynamics on the storage capacity. Our method opens an avenue for a systematic characterization of the storage capacity of quantum associative memories.

By using holographic duality, we study the entanglement measures, holographic entanglement entropy (HEE) and entanglement wedge cross-section (EWCS), and transport coefficients, for this model and analyze their dependence on free parameters which we classify into action parameters, observable parameters and axion factor. We find contrasting behaviors between HEE and EWCS with respect to observable parameters (charge and temperature), and the axion factor, indicating that they capture different types of quantum correlations. We also find that HEE exhibits positive correlation with both charge and thermal excitations, whereas EWCS exhibits a negative correlation with charge-related conductivities and thermal fluctuations. Furthermore, we find that the Horndeski coupling term, as the modification to standard gravity theory, does not change the qualitative behaviors of the conductivities and the entanglement measures.

TI Affinity-based geometric discord and quantum speed limits of its
   creation and decay
SO PHYSICA SCRIPTA
AB In this article, we define a faithful quantifier of bipartite quantum correlation, namely geometric version of quantum discord using affinity based metric. It is shown that the newly-minted measure resolves the local ancilla problem of Hilbert-Schmidt measures. Exploiting the notion of affinity-based discord, we derive Margolus-Levitin (ML) and Mandelstamm-Tamm (MT) bounds for the quantum speed limit time for the creation and decay of quantum correlation. The dynamical study suggests that the affinity measure is a better resource compared to entanglement. Finally, we study the role of quantum correlation on quantum speed limit.

TI Real-time simulation of (2+1)-dimensional lattice gauge theory on qubits
SO PROGRESS OF THEORETICAL AND EXPERIMENTAL PHYSICS
AB We study the quantum simulation of Z2 lattice gauge theory in 2+1 dimensions. The dual variable formulation, the so-called Wegner duality, is utilized for reducing redundant gauge degrees of freedom. The problem of artificial charge unconservation is resolved for any charge distribution. As a demonstration, we simulate the real-time evolution of the system with two static electric charges, i.e. with two temporal Wilson lines. Some results obtained by a simulator (with no hardware noise) and a real quantum computing device (with sizable hardware noise) are shown.

TI A quantum-bit encoding converter
SO NATURE PHOTONICS
AB From telecommunications to computing architectures, the realm of classical information hinges on converter technology to enable the exchange of data between digital and analogue formats, a process now routinely performed across a variety of electronic devices. A similar exigency also exists in quantum information technology, where different frameworks are being developed for quantum computing, communication and sensing. Thus, efficient quantum interconnects are a major need to bring these parallel approaches together and scale up quantum information systems. So far, however, the conversion between different optical quantum-bit encodings has remained challenging due to the difficulty of preserving fragile quantum superpositions and the demanding requirements for postselection-free implementations. Here we demonstrate such a conversion of quantum information between the two main paradigms, namely discrete- and continuous-variable qubits. We certify the protocol on a complete set of single-photon qubits, successfully converting them to cat-state qubits with fidelities exceeding the classical limit. Our result demonstrates an essential tool for enabling interconnected quantum devices and architectures with enhanced versatility and scalability.

SO PHYSICA A-STATISTICAL MECHANICS AND ITS APPLICATIONS
AB We introduce the Hessian of the negative ground-state energy as a Riemannian metric on the parametric family of the ground states of a parameterized Hamiltonian of a quantum system and study the critical behavior of the scalar curvature of this new metric. Taking the anisotropic XY chain in a transverse field as an example, we study the critical behaviors of the scalar curvature associated with the quantum phase transitions both numerically and analytically. The behaviors are found to be different from those of the Fubini-Study metric but in agreement with the scalar curvature for the Bogoliubov-Kubo-Mori metric in thermodynamic geometry from the perspective of the universality class. We also briefly discuss the Legendre structure concerning this Hessian metric.

TI Suppression of Static ZZ Interaction in an All-Transmon Quantum
   Processor
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW APPLIED
AB The superconducting transmon qubit is currently a leading qubit modality for quantum computing, but the gate performance in a quantum processor with transmons is often insufficient to support the running of complex algorithms for practical applications. It is thus highly desirable to further improve gate performance. Due to the weak anharmonicity of a transmon, a static ZZ interaction between coupled transmons commonly exists, undermining the gate performance and, in the long term, it can become performance limiting. Here, we theoretically explore a promising parameter region in an all-transmon system to address this issue. We show that a feasible parameter region, where the ZZ interaction is heavily suppressed, while leaving the XY interaction with an adequate strength to implement two-qubit gates, can be found for alltransmon systems. Thus, two-qubit gates, such as a cross-resonance gate or an iSWAP gate, can be realized without a detrimental effect from the static ZZ interaction. To illustrate this, we demonstrate that an iSWAP gate with a fast gate speed and dramatically lower conditional phase error can be achieved. By scaling up to a large-scale transmon quantum processor, especially for cases with fixed coupling, addressing errors, idling errors, and crosstalk that arise from the static ZZ interaction can also be strongly suppressed.

TI Dephasing superchannels
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB We characterize a class of environmental noises that decrease the coherent properties of quantum channels by introducing and analyzing the properties of dephasing superchannels. These are defined as superchannels that affect only nonclassical properties of a quantum channel E, i.e., they leave invariant the transition probabilities induced by E in the distinguished basis. We prove that such superchannels EC form a particular subclass of Schur-product supermaps that act on the Jamiolkowski state J(E) of a channel E via a Schur product, J' = J degrees C. We also find physical realizations of general EC through pre- and postprocessing employing dephasing channels with memory, and we show that memory plays a nontrivial role for quantum systems of dimension d > 2. Moreover, we prove that the coherence-generating power of a general quantum channel is a monotone under dephasing superchannels. Finally, we analyze the effect that dephasing noise can have on a quantum channel E by investigating the number of distinguishable channels that E can be mapped to by a family of dephasing superchannels. More precisely, we upper-bound this number in terms of hypothesis-testing channel divergence between E and its fully dephased version, and we also relate it to the robustness of coherence of E.

SO SYMMETRY-BASEL
AB The global quantum information-theoretical analysis of the class of Yukawa potential (CYP) in the presence of magnetic and Aharonov-Bohm (AB) fields has been examined both analytically and numerically in this research piece. The energy equation and wave function for the CYP are obtained by solving the Schrodinger equation in the presence of external magnetic and AB fields using the functional analysis technique. The probability density is used to calculate the Tsallis, Renyi, and Onicescu information energy entropies numerically. The influence of the screening parameter (beta), magnetic ((B) over right arrow), and AB (xi) fields on the global information-theoretical measurements for the CYP is explored. Atomic and molecular physics, quantum chemistry, and physics are specific areas where these research findings will find application.

TI Hilbert Space Delocalization under Random Unitary Circuits
SO ENTROPY
AB The unitary dynamics of a quantum system initialized in a selected basis state yield, generically, a state that is a superposition of all the basis states. This process, associated with the quantum information scrambling and intimately tied to the resource theory of coherence, may be viewed as a gradual delocalization of the system's state in the Hilbert space. This work analyzes the Hilbert space delocalization under the dynamics of random quantum circuits, which serve as a minimal model of the chaotic dynamics of quantum many-body systems. We employ analytical methods based on the replica trick and Weingarten calculus to investigate the time evolution of the participation entropies which quantify the Hilbert space delocalization. We demonstrate that the participation entropies approach, up to a fixed accuracy, their long-time saturation value in times that scale logarithmically with the system size. Exact numerical simulations and tensor network techniques corroborate our findings.

TI Placement of Nitrogen-Vacancy-Centers in Diamond Through Chemical Vapor
   Deposition Growth Techniques
SO PHYSICA STATUS SOLIDI A-APPLICATIONS AND MATERIALS SCIENCE
AB The positioning of nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers is critical for quantum technologies such as quantum sensing and computing. NV incorporation during chemical vapor deposition growth can provide a defect-free, well-controlled environment, yielding high spin-coherence times and stable color centers. Various reactor designs that allow for controlled gas-switching have been developed, and process conditions have been optimized to achieve low growth rates, enabling placement of single NV centers or NV ensembles during growth or post-growth at defined depths and in specified regions. This is primarily achieved by fabricating delta-doped layers-nanoscale-thick dopant layers within the diamond. In addition to using the as-grown layers, these structures can be further processed by lithography or implantation methods to laterally position NV centers at a defined depth, even in complex diamond structures. Under suitable growth conditions, NV centers can also be positioned on prepatterned microstructures by preferentially forming delta-doped layers on defined facets. For lateral positioning on flat surfaces, a similar approach can localize NVs. This article describes and compares these methods and outlines future perspectives in the context of quantum technologies.

TI High-speed information reconciliation with syndrome-based early
   termination for continuous-variable quantum key distribution
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB Information reconciliation (IR) is an indispensable component in the post-processing stage of continuous-variable quantum key distribution (CV-QKD), which adopts error-correcting codes to address the asymmetry of secret keys. Currently, low-density parity-check (LDPC) decoding in IR is a post-processing bottleneck in high-speed CV-QKD systems since the upper bound on secret key rate is higher than the information throughput delivered by decoder. In this paper, we study the relationship between the syndrome variation pattern (SVP) in iterative decoding and reconciliation frame error rate. An early termination scheme based on SVP is proposed and applied to multidimensional reconciliation, which can increase information throughput by adaptively adjusting the iteration number of iterative decoding to real-time decoding status. Furthermore, we show that only the resulting syndrome of the highest-rate code part in Raptor-like LDPC codes needs to be calculated to verify whether the reconciliation is successful by studying the convergency of resulting syndrome, which can save a large fraction of computational resources for syndrome calculation. Simulation results show that information throughput of the proposed scheme can be improved by 617.1% compared to the existing scheme when the IR efficiency reaches 97.09%. The proposed scheme points out a new direction for breaking the post-processing bottleneck in high-speed CV-QKD systems.

TI Four-state discrete modulation continuous variable quantum key
   distribution based on hardware synchronization
SO ACTA PHYSICA SINICA
AB In the case of continuous-variable quantum key distribution (CV-QKD) systems, synchronization is a key technology that ensures that both the transmitter and receiver obtain corresponding data synchronously. By designing an ingenious time sequence for the transmitter and receiver and using the peaking value acquisition technique and time domain heterodyne detection, we experimentally realize a four-state discrete modulation CV-QKD with a repetition rate of 10 MHz, transmitting over a distance of 25 km. With well-designed time sequence of hardware, Alice and Bob can obtain corresponding data automatically without using numerous software calculation methods.
   The secure key rates are calculated by using the method proposed by the Lutkenhaus group at the University of Waterloo in Canada. In the calculation, we first estimate the first and the second moment by using the measured quadratures of displaced thermal states, followed by calculating the secret key rate by using the convex optimization method through the reconstruction of the moments. There is no need to assume a linear quantum transmission channel to estimate the excess noise. Finally, secure key rates of 0.0022-0.0091 bit/pulse are achieved, and the excess noise is between 0.016 and 0.103.
   In this study, first, we introduce the prepare-and-measure scheme and the entanglement-based scheme of the four-state discrete modulation protocol. The Wigner images of the four coherent states on Alice's side, and four displaced thermal states on Bob's side are presented. Second, the design of hardware synchronization time series is introduced comprehensively. Third, the CV-QKD experiment setup is introduced and the time sequence is verified. Finally, the calculation method of secure key rate using the first and the second moment of quadrature is explained in detail. The phase space distribution of quadratures is also presented. The secret key rate ranges between 0.0022 and 0.0091 bits/pulse, and the equivalent excess noise are between 0.016 and 0.103. The average secret key bit rate is 24 kbit/s. During the experiment, the first and the second moment of the quantum state at the receiver end are found to fluctuate owing to the finite-size effect. This effect reduces the value of the secure key rate and limits the transmission distance of the CV-QKD system.
   In conclusion, four-state discrete modulation CV-QKD based on hardware synchronization is designed and demonstrated. The proposed hardware synchronization method can effectively reduce the cost, size, and power consumption. In the future, the finite-size effect will be investigated theoretically and experimentally to improve the performance of system.

TI Micromagnetic Design of Skyrmionic Materials and Chiral Magnetic
   Configurations in Patterned Nanostructures for Neuromorphic and Qubit
   Applications
SO NANOMATERIALS
AB Our study addresses the problematics of magnetic skyrmions, nanometer-size vortex-like swirling topological defects, broadly studied today for applications in classic, neuromorphic and quantum information technologies. We tackle some challenging issues of material properties versus skyrmion stability and manipulation within a multiple-scale modeling framework, involving complementary ab-initio and micromagnetic frameworks. Ab-initio calculations provide insight into the anatomy of the magnetic anisotropy, the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya asymmetric exchange interaction (DMI) and their response to a gating electric field. Various multi-layered heterostructures were specially designed to provide electric field tunable perpendicular magnetization and sizeable DMI, which are required for skyrmion occurrence. Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert micromagnetic calculations in nanometric disks allowed the extraction of material parameter phase diagrams in which magnetic textures were classified according to their topological charge. We identified suitable ranges of magnetic anisotropy, DMI and saturation magnetization for stabilizing skyrmionic ground states or writing/manipulating them using either a spin-transfer torque of a perpendicular current or the electric field. From analyzing the different contributions to the total magnetic free energy, we point out some critical properties influencing the skyrmions' stability. Finally, we discuss some experimental issues related to the choice of materials or the design of novel magnetic materials compatible with skyrmionic applications.

TI Non-uniform magnetic field as a booster for quantum speed limit: faster
   quantum information processing
SO NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB We probe the quantum speed limit (QSL) of an electron when it is trapped in a non-uniform magnetic field. We show that the QSL increases to a large value, but within the regime of causality, by choosing a proper variation in magnetic fields. We also probe the dependence of QSL on spin of electron and find that it is higher for spin-down electron in the relativistic regime. This can be useful in achieving faster speed of transmission of quantum information. Further, we use the Bremermann-Bekenstein bound to find a critical magnetic field that bridges the gap between non-relativistic and relativistic treatments and relates to the stability of matter. An analytical framework is developed. We also provide a plausible experimental design to supplement our theory.

TI Analysis for Satellite-Based High-Dimensional Extended B92 and
   High-Dimensional BB84 Quantum Key Distribution
SO ADVANCED QUANTUM TECHNOLOGIES
AB A systematic analysis of the advantages and challenges associated with the satellite-based implementation of the high dimensional extended B92 (HD-Ext-B92) and high-dimensional BB84 (HD-BB84) protocol is analyzed. The method used earlier for obtaining the key rate for the HD-Ext-B92 is modified here and subsequently the variations of the key rate, probability distribution of key rate (PDR), and quantum bit error rate (QBER) with respect to dimension and noise parameter of a depolarizing channel is studied using the modified key rate equation. Further, the variations of average key rate (per pulse) with zenith angle and link length in different weather conditions in day and night considering extremely low noise for dimension d=32${\rm d}=32$ are investigated using elliptic beam approximation. The effectiveness of the HD-(extended) protocols used here in creating satellite-based quantum key distribution links (both up-link and down-link) are established by appropriately modeling the atmosphere and analyzing the variation of average key rates with the probability distribution of the transmittance (PDT). The analysis performed here has revealed that in higher dimensions, HD-BB84 outperforms HD-Ext-B92 in terms of both key rate and noise tolerance. However, HD-BB84 experiences a more pronounced saturation of QBER in high dimensions.

TI Solving fractional differential equations on a quantum computer: A
   variational approach
SO AVS QUANTUM SCIENCE
AB We introduce an efficient variational hybrid quantum-classical algorithm designed for solving Caputo time-fractional partial differential equations. Our method employs an iterable cost function incorporating a linear combination of overlap history states. The proposed algorithm is not only efficient in terms of time complexity but also has lower memory costs compared to classical methods. Our results indicate that solution fidelity is insensitive to the fractional index and that gradient evaluation costs scale economically with the number of time steps. As a proof of concept, we apply our algorithm to solve a range of fractional partial differential equations commonly encountered in engineering applications, such as the subdiffusion equation, the nonlinear Burgers' equation, and a coupled diffusive epidemic model. We assess quantum hardware performance under realistic noise conditions, further validating the practical utility of our algorithm. (C) 2024 Author(s).

TI Efficient Quantum Answer Set Programming Solver Using Partial Diffusion
   and Entanglement
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB The relation between answer set programming (ASP) and combinatorial problems, especially the satisfiability problem (SAT), has attracted significant interest in the academic literature. This paper aims to introduce an efficient quantum answer set programming solver (QSAT) that can handle NP-hard combinatorial search problems by reducing the problem to MAX-3-SAT problem. This paper proposes a quantum algorithm that solves the MAX-3-SAT problem using amplification techniques that exploit entanglement and partial diffusion operator to find a solution with a high probability in O(root 2n/l) , where n is the number of variables and l denotes the number of literals. The proposed algorithm shows a speed-up in solving ASP problems compared with classical approaches.

TI Analysis of quantum properties of two-mode coupled harmonic oscillator
   based on entangled state representation
SO ACTA PHYSICA SINICA
AB The quantum oscillator model plays a significant role in quantum optics and quantum information and has been one of the hot topics in related research fields. Inspired by the single-mode linear harmonic oscillator and the two-mode entangled state representation, we construct a two-mode coupled harmonic oscillator in this work. Different from the quantum transformation method used in previous literature, the entangled state representation is directly used in this work to solve its energy eigenvalues and eigenfunctions easily. The energy eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of this two-mode coupled harmonic oscillator are continuous compared with those of the one-mode harmonic oscillator. Using the matrix theory of quantum operators, we derive the transformation and inverse transformation of the time evolution operator corresponding to the two-mode coupled harmonic oscillator. In addition, using the entangled state representation, the specific form of the time evolution of the two-mode vacuum state under the action of the oscillator is obtained. Through the analysis of quantum fidelity, it is found that the fidelity of the output quantum state decreases with the oscillator frequency increasing, and the fidelity eventually tends to zero with the increase of time. When analyzing the orthogonal squeezing properties of the output quantum state, this type of two-mode oscillator does not have the orthogonal squeezing effect, but it has a strong quantum dissipation effect instead. This conclusion is further verified by the quasi-probability distribution Q function of the quantum state phase space. Therefore, the two-mode coupled harmonic oscillator has a major reference value in quantum control such as quantum decoherence and quantum information transmission. Like the two-mode squeezed vacuum state, the photon distribution of the output quantum light field corresponding to the two-mode harmonic oscillator presents a super-Poisson distribution, and the photons exhibit a strong anti-bunching effect. Using the three-dimensional discrete plot of the photon number distribution, the super-Poisson distribution and quantum dissipation effect of the output quantum state are intuitively demonstrated. Finally, the SV, which is an entanglement criterion, is used to determine that the output quantum state has a high degree of entanglement. Further numerical analysis shows that the degree of entanglement increases with the action time and the oscillator frequency. In summary, the two-mode coupled harmonic oscillator constructed in this work can be used to prepare highly entangled quantum states through a complete quantum dissipation process. This provides theoretical support for experimental preparing quantum entangled states based on dissipative mechanisms.

TI Gauge-independent emission spectra and quantum correlations in the
   ultrastrong coupling regime of open system cavity-QED
SO NANOPHOTONICS
AB A quantum dipole interacting with an optical cavity is one of the key models in cavity quantum electrodynamics (cavity-QED). To treat this system theoretically, the typical approach is to truncate the dipole to two levels. However, it has been shown that in the ultrastrong-coupling regime, this truncation naively destroys gauge invariance. By truncating in a manner consistent with the gauge principle, we introduce master equations for open systems to compute gauge-invariant emission spectra, photon flux rates, and quantum correlation functions which show significant disagreement with previous results obtained using the standard quantum Rabi model. Explicit examples are shown using both the dipole gauge and the Coulomb gauge.

TI Quantum Classical Algorithm for the Study of Phase Transitions in the
   Hubbard Model via Dynamical Mean-Field Theory
SO QUANTUM REPORTS
AB Modeling many-body quantum systems is widely regarded as one of the most promising applications for near-term noisy quantum computers. However, in the near term, system size limitation will remain a severe barrier for applications in materials science or strongly correlated systems. A promising avenue of research is to combine many-body physics with machine learning for the classification of distinct phases. We present a workflow that synergizes quantum computing, many-body theory, and quantum machine learning (QML) for studying strongly correlated systems. In particular, it can capture a putative quantum phase transition of the stereotypical strongly correlated system, the Hubbard model. Following the recent proposal of the hybrid quantum-classical algorithm for the two-site dynamical mean-field theory (DMFT), we present a modification that allows the self-consistent solution of the single bath site DMFT. The modified algorithm can be generalized for multiple bath sites. This approach is used to generate a database of zero-temperature wavefunctions of the Hubbard model within the DMFT approximation. We then use a QML algorithm to distinguish between the metallic phase and the Mott insulator phase to capture the metal-to-Mott insulator phase transition. We train a recently proposed quantum convolutional neural network (QCNN) and then utilize the QCNN as a quantum classifier to capture the phase transition region. This work provides a recipe for application to other phase transitions in strongly correlated systems and represents an exciting application of small-scale quantum devices realizable with near-term technology.

TI The optical response of aromatic cyclocarbons
SO CHEMICAL SCIENCE
AB Cyclo[n]carbons are a recently synthesized class of carbon allotropes that offer a unique platform to probe electron delocalization, quantum confinement, and strong correlation effects. Their peculiar electronic properties and bond topologies make them attractive for next-generation molecular optoelectronic, photonic, and quantum technologies. To explore such a potential, a deep understanding of their optical response is necessary. Here, we present the first systematic characterization of the optical response of aromatic cyclo[n]carbons in the whole UV-Vis range, using state-of-the-art many-body methods. Our results show a remarkable tunability of their optical response with respect to ring size and structure, identifying key structure-property relationships. These findings provide a fundamental framework for tailoring the optical properties of pi-conjugated carbon nanorings and offer design principles for their integration into adaptive molecular devices and quantum photonics architectures.

TI Controlling dephasing of coupled qubits via shared bath coherence
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
AB The interaction of a quantum system with its environment limits its coherence time. This, in particular, restricts the utility of qubits in quantum information processing applications. In this paper, we show that the decoherence of a coupled qubit system can be minimized, or even eliminated, by exploiting the quantum coherence of the bath itself. We investigate the dephasing in a system of two spatially separated, electronically decoupled qubits, with direct or mediated coupling, interacting with a shared bath. For illustration, we treat F & ouml;rster or cavity-mediated coupling between semiconductor quantum dots interacting with acoustic phonons. Using the rigorous method of Trotter's decomposition with cumulant expansion, we demonstrate a reduction in the dephasing rates at specific distances between the dots. The control of dephasing with distance is a coherent effect of the shared bath and is absent for independent baths. It can be understood in terms of phonon-assisted transitions between the entangled qubit states of the coupled system.

TI High-capacity device-independent quantum secure direct communication
   based on hyper-encoding
SO FUNDAMENTAL RESEARCH
AB Quantum secure direct communication (QSDC) can directly transmit secret messages through quantum channel without keys. Device-independent (DI) QSDC guarantees the message security relying only on the observation of the Bell-inequality violation, but not on any detailed description or trust of the devices' inner workings. Compared with conventional QSDC, DI-QSDC has relatively low secret message capacity. To increase DI-QSDC's secret messages capacity, we propose a high-capacity DI-QSDC protocol based on the hyper-encoding technique. The total message leakage rate of our DI-QSDC protocol only relies on the most robust degree of freedom. We provide the numerical simulation of its secret message capacity altered with the communication distance. Our work serves as an important step toward the further development of DI-QSDC systems.

TI Designing silicon carbide heterostructures for quantum information
   science: challenges and opportunities
SO MATERIALS FOR QUANTUM TECHNOLOGY
AB Silicon carbide (SiC) can be synthesized in a number of different structural forms known as polytypes with a vast array of optically active point defects of interest for quantum information sciences. The ability to control and vary the polytypes during SiC synthesis may offer a powerful methodology for the formation of new material architectures that expand our ability to manipulate these defects, including extending coherence lifetimes and enhancing room temperature operation. Polytypic control during synthesis presents a significant challenge given the extreme conditions under which SiC is typically grown and the number of factors that can influence polytype selection. In situ monitoring of the synthesis process could significantly expand our ability to formulate novel polytype structures. In this perspective, we outline the state of the art and ongoing challenges for precision synthesis in SiC. We discuss available in situ x-ray characterization methods that will be instrumental in understanding the atomic scale growth of SiC and defect formation mechanisms. We highlight optimistic use cases for SiC heterostructures that will become possible with in situ polytypic control and end by discussing extended opportunities for integration of ultrahigh quality SiC materials with other semiconductor and quantum materials.

TI Multi-parameter microwave quantum sensing with a single atomic probe
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB We demonstrate a multi-parameter sensing scheme for free space microwave electric and magnetic fields in single vapor cell based on the atom-based microwave detection techniques. A weak probe laser though a rubidium vapor cell first acts as magnetic probe to measure the microwave magnetic field via atomic Rabi resonance of the ground state hyperfine transition. When another strong coupling laser is subsequently counter-propagated and overlapped with the probe laser in the same atomic vapor cell, the probe laser is then used as electric probe to measure microwave electric field by off-resonant microwave dressed Rydberg Autler-Townes splitting. We achieve measurement of microwave electric and magnetic fields without any complicated tuning methods at the clock frequency of 6.835 GHz. Based on the inherent relationship between microwave electric and magnetic fields, and their good linear response characteristics in respective suitable power ranges, the equivalent microwave magnetic fields are derived from linear fitting of the measured electric fields, which are in agreement with the calibrated experimental results within the same power range. This work provides an effective approach for extending the power dynamic range of atom-based microwave quantum sensors.

TI NISQ circuit compilation is the travelling salesman problem on a torus
SO QUANTUM SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB Noisy, intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) computers are expected to execute quantum circuits of up to a few hundred qubits. The circuits have to conform to NISQ architectural constraints regarding qubit allocation and the execution of multi-qubit gates. Quantum circuit compilation (QCC) takes a nonconforming circuit and outputs a compatible circuit. Can classical optimisation methods be used for QCC? Compilation is a known combinatorial problem shown to be solvable by two types of operations: (1) qubit allocation, and (2) gate scheduling. We show informally that the two operations form a discrete ring. The search landscape of QCC is a two dimensional discrete torus where vertices represent configurations of how circuit qubits are allocated to NISQ registers. Torus edges are weighted by the cost of scheduling circuit gates. The novelty of our approach uses the fact that a circuit's gate list is circular: compilation can start from any gate as long as all the gates will be processed, and the compiled circuit has the correct gate order. Our work bridges a theoretical and practical gap between classical circuit design automation and the emerging field of quantum circuit optimisation.

TI Optimal Computational Modeling and Simulation of QCA Reversible Gates

SO NANOMATERIALS
AB As the relationship between energy and information loss and reversible gates was revealed, much interest in reversible gate design arose, and as quantum-dot cellular automata (QCA) gained attention as a next-generation nano circuit design technology, various reversible gates based on QCA emerged. The proposed study optimizes the performance and design costs of existing QCA-based reversible gates including TR, RUG, PQR, and URG. According to most indicators, the proposed circuits showed significant improvement rates and outperformed existing studies. In particular, the proposed optimal TR, RUG, PQR, and URG showed performance improvements of 266%, 265%, 300%, and 144% in CostAD, respectively, compared with the best existing circuit. This shows outstanding improvement and superiority in terms of area and delay, which are the most important factors in the performance of nano-scale circuits that are becoming extremely miniaturized. Additionally, the exceptionally high-output polarization of the proposed circuits is an important indicator of the circuit's expansion and connection and increases the circuit's reliability.

TI Optoacoustic Entanglement in a Continuous Brillouin-Active Solid State
   System
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB Entanglement in hybrid quantum systems comprised of fundamentally different degrees of freedom, such as light and mechanics, is of interest for a wide range of applications in quantum technologies. Here, we propose to engineer bipartite entanglement between traveling acoustic phonons in a Brillouin active solid state system and the accompanying light wave. The effect is achieved by applying optical pump pulses to state-of-the-art waveguides, exciting a Brillouin Stokes process. This pulsed approach, in a system operating in a regime orthogonal to standard optomechanical setups, allows for the generation of entangled photon-phonon pairs, resilient to thermal fluctuations. We propose an experimental platform where readout of the optoacoustics entanglement is done by the simultaneous detection of Stokes and anti-Stokes photons in a two-pump configuration. The proposed mechanism presents an important feature in that it does not require initial preparation of the quantum ground state of the phonon mode.

TI Single-Beam Grating-Chip 3D and 1D Optical Lattices
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB Ultracold atoms are crucial for unlocking truly precise and accurate quantum metrology and provide an essential platform for quantum computing, communication, and memories. One of the largest ongoing challenges is the miniaturization of these quantum devices. Here, we show that the typically macroscopic optical lattice architecture at the heart of many ultraprecise quantum technologies can be realized with a single-input laser beam on the same diffractive chip already used to create the ultracold atoms. Moreover, this inherently ultrastable platform enables access to a plethora of new lattice dimensionalities and geometries, ideally suited for the design of high-accuracy, portable quantum devices.

TI Efficient Low-Latency Hardware Architecture for Module-Lattice-Based
   Digital Signature Standard
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB The rapid advancement of powerful quantum computers poses a significant security risk to current public-key cryptosystems, which heavily rely on the computational complexity of problems such as discrete logarithms and integer factorization. As a result, CRYSTALS-Dilithium, a lattice-based digital signature scheme with the potential to be an alternative algorithm that can withstand both quantum and classical attacks, has been standardized as ML-DSA after NIST Post-Quantum Cryptography competition. While prior studies have proposed hardware designs to accelerate this cryptosystem, there is room for further optimization in the tradeoff between performance and hardware consumption. This paper addresses these limitations by presenting an efficient low-latency hardware architecture for ML-DSA, leveraging optimized timing schedules for its three main algorithms. The hardware implementation enables runtime switching main operations in ML-DSA with various security levels. We design flexible arithmetic and hash modules tailored for ML-DSA, the most time-consuming submodules and key determinants of the scheme implementation. Combined with efficient operation scheduling to maximize the utilized time of submodules, our design achieves the best latency among FPGA-based implementations, outperforming stateof-the-art works by 1.27 similar to 2.58x in terms of the area-time tradeoff metric. Therefore, the proposed hardware architecture demonstrates its practical applicability for digital signature cryptosystems in post-quantum era.

TI Practical strategies for enhancing the valley splitting in Si/SiGe
   quantum wells
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
AB Silicon/silicon-germanium heterostructures have many important advantages for hosting spin qubits. However, controlling the valley splitting (the energy splitting between the two low-lying conduction-band valleys) remains a critical challenge for ensuring qubit reliability. Broad distributions of valley splittings are commonplace, even among quantum dots formed on the same chip. In this work, we theoretically explore the interplay between quantum-well imperfections that suppress the valley splitting and cause variability, such as broadened interfaces and atomic steps at the interface, while self-consistently accounting for germanium concentration fluctuations. We consider both conventional and unconventional approaches for controlling the valley splitting and present concrete strategies for implementing them. Our results provide a clear path for achieving qubit uniformity in a scalable silicon quantum computer.

AB We study the error threshold properties of holographic quantum error-correcting codes. We demonstrate that holographic conformal field theories admit an algebraic threshold, which is related to the confinement-deconfinement phase transition. We then apply geometric intuition from holography and the Hawking-Page phase transition to motivate the conformal field theory result, and comment on potential extensions to other confining theories.

TI High efficiency polarization encoding using a single thermal and
   electro-optic TFLN-based chip for quantum key distribution
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB Quantum key distribution (QKD) relies on quantum state manipulation to achieve unconditionally secure key transmission. Polarization encoding, a mainstream QKD scheme, faces practical limitations due to the bulkiness and instability of discrete optical components. This work presents a polarization-encoding chip based on hybrid thin-film lithium niobate (TFLN) and silicon-on-insulator (SOI) integration, enabling dynamic control of four polarization states R), A), L), and D) with extinction ratios over 16.78 dB, using only a single thermal and electro-optic phase shifter in a compact architecture. Experimental results demonstrate that the chip achieves a secure key rate (SKR) of 328 kbps and a quantum bit error rate (QBER) of 1.96% at 100 MHz repetition rate in a 10 km fiber-based QKD system. Compared to conventional silicon-based carrier-depletion modulators (CDMs), the TFLN-SOI hybrid integration design avoids phase saturation and dynamic loss induced by carrier depletion, significantly enhancing the stability and scalability of polarization encoding.<br /> (c) 2025 Optica Publishing Group under the terms of the Optica Open Access Publishing Agreement

TI Generation of photonic tensor network states with circuit QED
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB We propose a circuit QED platform and protocol to generate microwave photonic tensor network states deterministically. We first show that using a microwave cavity as ancilla and a transmon qubit as emitter is a good platform to produce photonic matrix product states. The ancilla cavity combines a large controllable Hilbert space with a long coherence time, which we predict translates into a high number of entangled photons and states with a high bond dimension. Going beyond this paradigm, we then consider a natural generalization of this platform, in which several cavity-qubit pairs are coupled to form a chain. The photonic states thus produced feature a two-dimensional entanglement structure and can be interpreted as radial plaquette projected entangled pair states [Wei, Malz, and Cirac, Phys. Rev. Lett. 128, 010607 (2022)], which include many paradigmatic states, such as the broad class of isometric tensor network states, graph states, and string-net states.

SO ANNUAL REVIEW OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY
AB Quantum information promises dramatic advances in computing last seen in the digital revolution, but quantum hardware is fragile, noisy, and resource intensive. Chemistry has a role in developing new materials for quantum information that are robust to noise, scalable, and operable in ambient conditions. While molecular structure is the foundation for understanding mechanism and reactivity, molecular structure/quantum function relationships remain mostly undiscovered. Using singlet fission as a specific example of a multielectron process capable of producing long-lived spin-entangled electronic states at high temperatures, I describe how to exploit molecular structure and symmetry to gain quantum function and how some principles learned from singlet fission apply more broadly to quantum science.

TI Cold Boot Attacks on the Supersingular Isogeny Key Encapsulation (SIKE)
   Mechanism
SO APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL
AB This research paper evaluates the feasibility of cold boot attacks on the Supersingular Isogeny Key Encapsulation (SIKE) mechanism. This key encapsulation mechanism has been included in the list of alternate candidates of the third round of the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Post-Quantum Cryptography Standardization Process. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time this scheme is assessed in the cold boot attacks setting. In particular, our evaluation is focused on the reference implementation of this scheme. Furthermore, we present a dedicated key-recovery algorithm for SIKE in this setting and show that the key recovery algorithm works for all the parameter sets recommended for this scheme. Moreover, we compute the success rates of our key recovery algorithm through simulations and show the key recovery algorithm may reconstruct the SIKE secret key for any SIKE parameters for a fixed and small alpha=0.001 (the probability of a 0 to 1 bit-flipping) and varying values for beta (the probability of a 1 to 0 bit-flipping) in the set {0.001,0.01, horizontal ellipsis ,0.1}. Additionally, we show how to integrate a quantum key enumeration algorithm with our key-recovery algorithm to improve its overall performance.

TI Reliable experimental certification of one-way Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen
   steering
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Quantum steering is a recently defined form of quantum correlation which lies at the heart of quantum mechanics. In contrast to other types of quantum correlations, quantum steering is inherently asymmetric, which implies that it could manifest in one direction but not in the opposite direction. This rather peculiar phenomenon, known as one-way steering, has been demonstrated in several experiments, but subtlety remains. In fact, all experiments were shown to be ambiguous until a very recent conclusive one, which, however, made crucial use of a high-dimensional embedding to get around assumptions. This leaves the question open of whether the one-way steering phenomenon can be reliably demonstrated in the genuine two-qubit system. Here, we report such an experimental demonstration of one-way steering for a family of two-qubit states. Our experimental setup and results thus resolve the subtlety caused by fidelity assumption in previous experiments without the need for higher dimensional embedding. Moreover, our work provides a universal method to characterize one-way steering phenomenon for generic two-qubit states.

TI CURRENT PARADIGMS FOR CONSTRUCTION OF LATTICE-BASED DIGITAL SIGNATURE
   SCHEMES
SO PRIKLADNAYA DISKRETNAYA MATEMATIKA
AB With the advent of quantum computing, research into post-quantum cryptography has gained significant attention. This is a novel branch of cryptography that utilizes algorithms and protocols designed to withstand attacks from quantum computers. Lattice theory represents a promising area within post-quantum cryptographic research. Two early examples of lattice-based cryptosystems are the GGH and NTRU schemes. These schemes are based on the challenge of finding the closest vector in a lattice and differ primarily in the type of lattice used. The NTRUSign protocol was developed by combining the strengths of both schemes. In 2008, another approach to lattice signatures was introduced by a group of authors. It is based on the hash-and-sign paradigm, in which a signature for a message is generated using a trapdoor. A year later, V. Lyubashevsky proposed another method for constructing lattice-based signatures that utilizes the Fiat - Shamir transform. However, due to the nature of the underlying lattice structure, the algorithm for signature generation produces a correct signature only with a certain probability. This is due to the use of a rejection sampling for security purposes. This paper presents an overview of existing lattice-based signature construction approaches and cryptographic schemes that are based on these approaches. A comparative analysis was conducted on these schemes, identifying the advantages and disadvantages of each method. Based on the results, optimal conditions for the application of each approach have been determined.

TI Chiral-coupling-assisted refrigeration in trapped ions
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICS B-ATOMIC MOLECULAR AND OPTICAL PHYSICS
AB Trapped ions can be cooled close to their motional ground state, which is imperative in implementing quantum computation and quantum simulation. Here, we theoretically investigate the capability of light-mediated chiral couplings between ions to enable a superior cooling scheme exceeding the single-ion limit of sideband cooling. Under asymmetric driving, the target ion manifests the chiral-coupling-assisted refrigeration at the price of heating others, where its steady-state phonon occupation outperforms the lower bound set by a single ion. We further explore the optimal operation conditions for the refrigeration where a faster rate of cooling can still be sustained. Under an additional nonguided decay channel, a broader parameter regime emerges to support the superior cooling and carries over into the reciprocal coupling, suppressing the heating effect instead. Our results present a tunable resource of collective chiral couplings which can help surpass the bottleneck of the cooling procedure and open up new possibilities in applications of trapped-ion-based quantum computation and simulation.

TI Noise-Assisted Digital Quantum Simulation of Open Systems Using Partial
   Probabilistic Error Cancellation
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB Quantum systems are inherently open and susceptible to environmental noise, which can have both detrimental and beneficial effects on their dynamics. This phenomenon has been observed in biomolecular systems, where noise enables novel functionalities, making the simulation of their dynamics a crucial target for digital and analog quantum simulation. Nevertheless, the computational capabilities of current quantum devices are often limited due to their inherent noise. In this work, we present a novel approach that capitalizes on the intrinsic noise of quantum devices to reduce the computational resources required for simulating open quantum systems. Our approach combines quantum noise characterization methods with quantum error mitigation techniques, enabling us to manipulate and control the intrinsic noise in a quantum circuit. Specifically, we selectively enhance or reduce decoherence rates in the quantum circuit to achieve the desired simulation of open-system dynamics. We provide a detailed description of our methods and report on the results of noise characterization and quantum error mitigation experiments conducted on both real and emulated IBM Quantum computers. Additionally, we estimate the experimental resource requirements for our techniques. Our approach holds the potential to unlock new simulation techniques in noisy intermediate-scale quantum devices, harnessing their intrinsic noise to enhance quantum computations.

TI SOQCS: A Stochastic Optical Quantum Circuit Simulator
SO SOFTWAREX
AB Stochastic Optical Quantum Circuit Simulator (SOQCS) is a C++ and Python library which offers a framework to define, simulate and study quantum linear optical circuits in presence of various imperfections typically encountered in experiments. Quantum circuits can be defined from basic components, including emitters, linear optical elements, delays and detectors. The imperfections come from partial distinguishability of photons, lossy propagation media, unbalanced beamsplitters and non-ideal emitters and detectors for example. SOQCS also provides various simulator cores and tools to analyze the output. Furthermore, the configuration of detectors also includes postselection. SOQCS is developed using a modular approach in which different modules are applied in an automated easy to use manner. Furthermore, the modular approach allows for further extensions of the SOQCS capabilities in future.

TI Quantum and Quantum-Inspired Stereographic K Nearest-Neighbour
   Clustering
SO ENTROPY
AB Nearest-neighbour clustering is a simple yet powerful machine learning algorithm that finds natural application in the decoding of signals in classical optical-fibre communication systems. Quantum k-means clustering promises a speed-up over the classical k-means algorithm; however, it has been shown to not currently provide this speed-up for decoding optical-fibre signals due to the embedding of classical data, which introduces inaccuracies and slowdowns. Although still not achieving an exponential speed-up for NISQ implementations, this work proposes the generalised inverse stereographic projection as an improved embedding into the Bloch sphere for quantum distance estimation in k-nearest-neighbour clustering, which allows us to get closer to the classical performance. We also use the generalised inverse stereographic projection to develop an analogous classical clustering algorithm and benchmark its accuracy, runtime and convergence for decoding real-world experimental optical-fibre communication data. This proposed 'quantum-inspired' algorithm provides an improvement in both the accuracy and convergence rate with respect to the k-means algorithm. Hence, this work presents two main contributions. Firstly, we propose the general inverse stereographic projection into the Bloch sphere as a better embedding for quantum machine learning algorithms; here, we use the problem of clustering quadrature amplitude modulated optical-fibre signals as an example. Secondly, as a purely classical contribution inspired by the first contribution, we propose and benchmark the use of the general inverse stereographic projection and spherical centroid for clustering optical-fibre signals, showing that optimizing the radius yields a consistent improvement in accuracy and convergence rate.

AB layers are of paramount importance in software architecture, as they shield the higher-level formulation of payload computations from lower-level details. Since quantum computing (QC) introduces many such details that are often unaccustomed to computer scientists, an obvious desideratum is to devise appropriate abstraction layers for QC. For discrete optimisation, one such abstraction is to cast problems in quadratic unconstrained binary optimisation (QUBO) form, which is amenable to a variety of quantum approaches. However, different mathematically equivalent forms can lead to different behaviour on quantum hardware, ranging from ease of mapping onto qubits to performance scalability.
   In this work, we show how using higher-order problem formulations (that provide better expressivity in modelling optimisation tasks than plain QUBO formulations) and their automatic transformation into QUBO form can be used to leverage such differences to prioritise between different desired non-functional properties for quantum optimisation. Based on a practically relevant use-case and a graph-theoretic analysis, we evaluate how different transformation approaches influence widely used quantum performance metrics (circuit depth, gates count, gate distribution, qubit scaling), and also consider the classical computational efforts required to perform the transformations, as they influence possibilities for achieving future quantum advantage. Furthermore, we establish more general properties and invariants of the transformation methods. Our quantitative study shows that the approach allows us to satisfy different trade-offs, and suggests various possibilities for the future construction of general-purpose abstractions and automatic generation of useful quantum circuits from high-level problem descriptions.

TI Experimental quantum simulation of superradiant phase transition beyond
   no-go theorem via antisqueezing
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB The superradiant phase transition in thermal equilibrium is a fundamental concept bridging statistical physics and electrodynamics, which has never been observed in real physical systems since the first proposal in the 1970s. The existence of this phase transition in cavity quantum electrodynamics systems is still subject of ongoing debates due to the no-go theorem induced by the so-called A(2) term. Moreover, experimental conditions to study this phase transition are hard to achieve with current accessible technology. Based on the platform of nuclear magnetic resonance, here we experimentally simulate the occurrence of an equilibrium superradiant phase transition beyond no-go theorem by introducing the antisqueezing effect. The mechanism relies on that the antisqueezing effect recovers the singularity of the ground state via exponentially enhancing the zero point fluctuation of system. The strongly entangled and squeezed Schrodinger cat states of spins are achieved experimentally in the superradiant phase, which may play an important role in fundamental tests of quantum theory and implementations of quantum metrology.
   Quantum simulation allows to investigate otherwise inaccessible physical scenarios. Here, the authors simulate a quantum Rabi model using nuclear spins, including the A2 term and an anti-squeezing term, which allows them to see signatures of a superradiant phase transition in the simulated system.

TI Dawn and dusk satellite quantum key distribution using time- and
   phase-based encoding and polarization filtering
SO OPTICA QUANTUM
AB Free-space optical communication links promise better security and increase bandwidths but can suffer from noise in daylight. This is particularly detrimental in quantum communications where current mitigation techniques, such as spectral, temporal, and spatial filtering, are not yet sufficient to make daylight tolerable for satellite quantum key distribution (SatQKD). As all current SatQKD systems are polarization-encoded, polarization filtering has not been investigated. However, by using time-and phase-encoded SatQKD, it is possible to filter in polarization in addition to existing domains. Scattered daylight can be more than 90% polarized in the visible band, yielding a reduction in detected daylight between 3 dB and 13 dB, such that polarization filtering can reduce the brightness of 780 nm daylight to below the unfiltered equivalent at 1550 nm. Simulations indicate that polarization filtering increases the secure key rate and allows for SatQKD to be performed at dawn and dusk. This could open the way for daylight SatQKD utilizing shorter near-infrared wavelengths and retaining their benefits.

TI Quantum-empowered federated learning and 6G wireless networks for IoT
   security: Concept, challenges and future directions
SO FUTURE GENERATION COMPUTER SYSTEMS-THE INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ESCIENCE
AB The Internet of Things (IoT) has revolutionized various sectors by enabling seamless device interaction. However, the proliferation of IoT devices has also raised significant security and privacy concerns. Traditional security measures often fail to address these concerns due to the unique characteristics of IoT networks, such as heterogeneity, scalability, and resource constraints. This survey paper adopts a thematic exploration approach for a comprehensive analysis to investigate the convergence of quantum computing, federated learning, and 6G wireless networks. This novel intersection is explored to significantly improve security and privacy within the IoT ecosystem. Quantum computing can enhance encryption algorithms to make IoT data more secure for intelligent IoT applications. Federated learning, a decentralized machine learning approach, allows IoT devices to learn a shared model while keeping all the training data on the original device, thereby enhancing privacy. This synergy becomes even more crucial when integrated with the high-speed, low-latency capabilities of 6G networks, which can facilitate real-time, secure data processing and communication among many IoT devices. Second, we discuss the latest developments, offering an up-to-date overview of advanced solutions, available datasets, and key performance metrics and summarizing the vital insights, challenges, and trends in securing IoT systems. Third, we design a conceptual framework for integrating quantum computing in federated learning, adapted for 6G networks. Finally, we highlight the future advancements in quantum technologies and 6G networks and summarize the implications for IoT security, paving the way for researchers and practitioners in the field of IoT security.

TI Indigenisation of the Quantum Clock: An Indispensable Tool for Modern
   Technologies
SO ATOMS
AB Time and frequency (T&F) measurement with unprecedented accuracy is the backbone for several sophisticated technologies, commensurate with the evolution of human civilisation in the 20th century in terms of communication, positioning, navigation, and precision timing. This necessity drove researchers in the early 1950s to build atomic clocks that have now evolved to a state-of-the-art level, operating at optical wavelengths as optical atomic clocks, which use cold and trapped samples of atomic/ionic species and various other sophisticated diagnostic test techniques. Such ultrahigh-precision accurate clocks have made it possible to probe fundamental aspects of science through incredibly sensitive measurements. On the other hand, they meet the T&F synchronisation standards for classical and emerging quantum technologies at the desired level of accuracy. Considering the impact of optical atomic clocks in the second quantum revolution (quantum 2.0), they have been identified as an indispensable critical technology in worldwide quantum missions, including in India. This article reviews the present international scenario regarding optical atomic clocks and their related technologies and draws a roadmap for their indigenisation over the next decade.

TI KpqBench: Performance and Implementation Security Analysis of KpqC
   Competition Round 1 Candidates
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB As the global migration to post-quantum cryptography (PQC) continues to progress actively, in Korea, the Post-Quantum Cryptography Research Center has been established to acquire PQC technology, leading the KpqC Competition. In February 2022, the KpqC Competition issued a call for proposals for PQC algorithms. By November 2022, 16 candidates were selected for the first round (7 KEMs and 9 DSAs). Currently, Round 1 submissions are being evaluated with respect to security, efficiency, and scalability in various environments. At the current stage, evaluating the software through an analysis to improve the software quality of the first-round submissions is judged appropriately. In this paper, we present analysis results regarding performance and implementation security on based dependency-free approach of external libraries. Namely, we configure extensive tests for an analysis with no dependencies by replacing external libraries that can complicate the build process with hard coding. From the performance perspective, we provide analysis results of performance profiling, execution time, and memory usage for each of the KpqC candidates. From the implementation security perspective, we examine bugs and errors in the actual implementations using Valgrind software, a Metamorphic Testing methodology that can include wide test coverage and constant-time implementation against the timing attack. Until the KpqC standard algorithm is announced, we argue that continuous integration of extensive tests will lead to a high-level clean code of KpqC candidates.

This paper presents a robust and scalable cryogenic packaging method for thin-film lithium niobate (TFLN) photonic chips. The packaged fiber-to-chip interface shows a coupling efficiency of 15.7% +/- 0.3%, with minimal variation of +/- 0.5% as the temperature cools down from 295 K to 1.5 K. Furthermore, the packaged chip exhibits outstanding stability over multiple thermal cycling, highlighting its potential for practical applications in cryogenic environments.

TI Infinitesimal reference frames suffice to determine the asymmetry
   properties of a quantum system
SO NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB Symmetry principles are fundamental in physics, and while they are well understood within Lagrangian mechanics, their impact on quantum channels has a range of open questions. The theory of asymmetry grew out of information-theoretic work on entanglement and quantum reference frames, and allows us to quantify the degree to which a quantum system encodes coordinates of a symmetry group. Recently, a complete set of entropic conditions was found for asymmetry in terms of correlations relative to infinitely many quantum reference frames. However, these conditions are difficult to use in practice and their physical implications unclear. In the present theoretical work, we show that this set of conditions has extensive redundancy, and one can restrict to reference frames forming any closed surface in the state space that has the maximally mixed state in its interior. This in turn implies that asymmetry can be reduced to just a single entropic condition evaluated at the maximally mixed state. Contrary to intuition, this shows that we do not need macroscopic, classical reference frames to determine the asymmetry properties of a quantum system, but instead infinitesimally small frames suffice. Building on this analysis, we provide simple, closed conditions to estimate the minimal depolarization needed to make a given quantum state accessible under channels covariant with any given symmetry group.

TI Complete Complementarity Relations in System-environment Decoherent
   Dynamics
SO BRAZILIAN JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB We investigate the system-environment information flow from the point of view of complete complementarity relations. We consider some commonly used noisy quantum channels: Amplitude damping, phase damping, bit flip, bit-phase flip, phase flip, depolarizing, and correlated amplitude damping. By starting with an entangled bipartite pure quantum state, with the linear entropy being the quantifier of entanglement, we study how entanglement is redistributed and turned into general correlations between the degrees of freedom of the whole system. For instance, it is possible to express the entanglement entropy in terms of the multipartite quantum coherence or in terms of the correlated quantum coherence of the different partitions of the system. In addition, we notice that for the depolarizing and bit-phase flip channels the wave and particle aspects can decrease or increase together. Besides, by considering the environment as part of a pure quantum system, the linear entropy is shown to be not just a measure of mixedness of a particular subsystem, but a correlation measure of the subsystem with rest of the world.

TI Repetitive Readout and Real-Time Control of Nuclear Spin Qubits in 171Yb
   Atoms
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB We demonstrate high-fidelity repetitive measurements of nuclear spin qubits in an array of neutral ytterbium-171 (171Yb) atoms. We show that the qubit state can be measured with a spin-flip probability of 0.004(4) for a single tweezer and 0.012(3) averaged over the array. This is accomplished by high cyclicity of one of the nuclear spin qubit states with an optically excited state under a magnetic field of B = 58 G, resulting in a spin-flip probability of approximately 10-5 per scattered photon during fluorescence readout. The performance improves further as similar to 1/B2. The state discrimination fidelity is 0.993(4) with a state-averaged readout survival of 0.994(3), limited by off-resonant scattering to dark states. We combine our measurement technique with high-contrast rotations of the nuclear spin qubit via an ac magnetic field to explore two paradigmatic scenarios, including the noncommutativity of measurements in orthogonal bases, and the quantum Zeno mechanism in which measurements "freeze" coherent evolution. Finally, we employ real-time feedforward to repetitively and deterministically prepare the qubit in the +z or -z direction after initializing it in a different basis and performing a measurement in the Z basis. These capabilities constitute an important step towards adaptive quantum circuits with atom arrays.

AB Modularity is a promising approach for scaling up quantum computers and therefore integrating higher qubit counts. The essence of such architectures lies in their reliance on high-fidelity and fast quantum state transfers enabled by generating entanglement between chips. In addressing the challenge of implementing quantum coherent communication channels to interconnect quantum processors, various techniques have been proposed to account for qubit technology specifications and the implemented communication protocol. By employing Design Space Exploration (DSE) methodologies, this work presents a comparative analysis of the cavity-mediated interconnect technologies according to a defined figure of merit, and we identify the configurations related to the cavity and atomic decay rates as well as the qubit-cavity coupling strength that meet the efficiency thresholds. We therefore contribute to benchmarking contemporary cavity-mediated quantum interconnects and guide the development of reliable and scalable chip-to-chip links for modular quantum computers.

TI Quantum simulation with gauge fixing: From Ising lattice gauge theory to
   dynamical flux model
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Quantum simulation of synthetic dynamic gauge field has attracted much attentions in recent years. There are two traditional ways to simulate gauge theories. One is to directly simulate the full Hamiltonian of gauge theories with local gauge symmetries. And the other is to engineer the projected Hamiltonian in one gauge subsector. In this work, we provide the third way towards the simulation of gauge theories based on gauge fixing. To demonstrate this concept, we fix the gauge of an Ising lattice gauge field coupled with spinless fermions on a ladder geometry. After the gauge fixing, this gauge theory is reduced to a simpler model, in which fermions hop on a ladder with a fluctuating dynamical Z2 flux. Then we show that this model can be realized via Floquet engineering in ultracold atomic gases. By analytical and numerical studies of this dynamical flux model, we deduce that there is a confinement-to-deconfinement phase transition in the original unfixed gauge theory. This work paves the way to quantum simulate lattice gauge theory using the concept of gauge fixing, relevant both for condensed-matter and high-energy physics.

TI Practical Analysis of Sending or Not-Sending Twin-Field Quantum Key
   Distribution with Frequency Side Channels
SO APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL
AB The twin-field quantum key distribution (TF-QKD) and its variants can overcome the fundamental rate-distance limit of QKD. However, their physical implementations with the side channels remain the subject of further research. We test the side channel of a type of external intensity modulation that applies a Mach-Zehnder-type electro-optical intensity modulator, which shows the distinguishability of the signal and decoy states in the frequency domain. Based on this security loophole, we propose a side-channel attack, named the passive frequency-shift attack, on the imperfect implementation of the sending or not-sending (SNS) TF-QKD protocol. We analyze the performance of the SNS protocol with the actively odd-parity pairing (AOPP) method under the side-channel attack by giving the formula of the upper bound of the real secret key rate and comparing it with the lower bound of the secret key rate under Alice and Bob's estimation. The simulation results quantitatively show the effectiveness of the attack on the imperfect devices at a long distance. Our results emphasize the importance of practical security at the light source and might provide a valuable reference for device selection in the practical implementation of the SNS protocol.</p>

TI Quantum and Classical Communication Complexity of Permutation-Invariant

SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INFORMATION THEORY
AB This paper gives a nearly tight characterization of the quantum communication complexity of permutation-invariant Boolean functions. With such a characterization, we show that the quantum and randomized communication complexity of permutation-invariant Boolean functions are quadratically equivalent (up to a polylogarithmic factor of the input size). Our results extend a recent line of research regarding query complexity to communication complexity, showing symmetry prevents exponential quantum speedups. Furthermore, we show that the Log-rank Conjecture holds for any non-trivial total permutation-invariant Boolean function. Moreover, we establish a relationship between the quantum/classical communication complexity and the approximate rank of permutation-invariant Boolean functions. This implies the correctness of the Log-approximate-rank Conjecture for permutation-invariant Boolean functions in both randomized and quantum settings (up to a polylogarithmic factor of the input size).

TI Single-atom exploration of optimized nonequilibrium quantum
   thermodynamics by reinforcement learning
SO COMMUNICATIONS PHYSICS
AB Exploring optimized processes of thermodynamics at microscale is vital to exploitation of quantum advantages relevant to microscopic machines and quantum information processing. Here, we experimentally execute a reinforcement learning strategy, using a single trapped Ca-40(+) ion, for engineering quantum state evolution out of thermal equilibrium. We consider a qubit system coupled to classical and quantum baths, respectively, the former of which is achieved by switching on the spontaneous emission relevant to the qubit and the latter of which is made based on a Jaynes-Cummings model involving the qubit and the vibrational degree of freedom of the ion. Our optimized operations make use of the external control on the qubit, designed by the reinforcement learning approach. In comparison to the conventional situation of free evolution subject to the same Hamiltonian of interest, our experimental implementation presents the evolution of the states with higher fidelity while with less consumption of entropy production and work, highlighting the potential of reinforcement learning in accomplishment of optimized nonequilibrium thermodynamic processes at atomic level.

TI General quantum Chinos games
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICS COMMUNICATIONS
AB The Chinos game is a non-cooperative game between players who try to guess the total sum of coins drawn collectively. Semiclassical and quantum versions of this game were proposed by F. Guinea and M. A. Martin-Delgado, in J. Phys. A: Math. Gen. 36 L197 (2003), where the coins are replaced by a boson whose number occupancy is the aim of the player's guesses. Here, we propose other versions of the Chinos game using a hard-core boson, one qubit, and two qubits. In the latter case, using entangled states the second player has a stable winning strategy that becomes symmetric for non-entangled states. Finally, we use the IBM Quantum Experience to compute the basic quantities involved in the two-qubit version of the game.

TI Exploring Parameter Redundancy in the Unitary Coupled-Cluster Ansa''tze
   for Hybrid Variational Quantum Computing
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY A
AB One of the commonly used chemically inspired approachesin variationalquantum computing is the unitary coupled-cluster (UCC) ansa''tze.Despite being a systematic way of approaching the exact limit, thenumber of parameters in the standard UCC ansa''tze exhibits unfavorablescaling with respect to the system size, hindering its practical useon near-term quantum devices. Efforts have been taken to propose somevariants of the UCC ansa''tze with better scaling. In this paper,we explore the parameter redundancy in the preparation of unitarycoupled-cluster singles and doubles (UCCSD) ansa''tze employingspin-adapted formulation, small amplitude filtration, and entropy-basedorbital selection approaches. Numerical results of using our approachon some small molecules have exhibited a significant cost reductionin the number of parameters to be optimized and in the time to convergencecompared with conventional UCCSD-VQE simulations. We also discussthe potential application of some machine learning techniques in furtherexploring the parameter redundancy, providing a possible directionfor future studies.

TI Strategies to simulate dephasing-assisted quantum transport on digital
   quantum computers
SO NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB Simulating charge and energy transfer in extended molecular networks requires an effective model to include the environment because it significantly affects the quantum dynamics. A prototypical effect known as environment-assisted quantum transport (ENAQT) consists in the enhancement of the transfer efficiency by the interaction with an environment. A simple description of this phenomenon is obtained by a quantum master equation describing a quantum walk over the molecular network in the presence of inter-site decoherence. We consider the problem of simulating the dynamics underlying ENAQT in a digital quantum computer. Two different quantum algorithms are introduced, the first one based on stochastic Hamiltonians and the second one based on a collision scheme. We test both algorithms by simulating ENAQT in a small molecular network on a quantum computer emulator and provide a comparative analysis of the two approaches. Both algorithms can be implemented in a memory efficient encoding with the number of required qubits scaling logarithmically with the size of the simulated system while the number of gates increases quadratically. We discuss the algorithmic quantum trajectories generated by the two simulation strategies showing that they realize distinct unravellings of the site-dephasing master equation. In our approach, the non-unitary dynamics of the open system is obtained through effective representations of the environment, paving the way to digital quantum simulations of quantum transport influenced by structured environments.

TI A graph-state based synthesis framework for Clifford isometries
SO QUANTUM
AB We tackle the problem of Clifford isometry compilation, i.e, how to synthesize a Clifford isometry into an executable quantum circuit. We propose a simple framework for synthesis that only exploits the elementary properties of the Clifford group and one equation of the symplectic group. We highlight the versatility of our framework by showing that several normal forms of the literature are natural corollaries. We recover the state of the art two-qubit gate depth necessary for the execution of a Clifford circuit on an LNN architecture, concomitantly with another work. We also propose practical synthesis algorithms for Clifford isometries with a focus on Clifford operators, graph states and codiagonalization of Pauli rotations. Benchmarks show that in all three cases we improve the 2-qubit gate count and depth of random instances compared to the state-of-the-art methods. We also improve the execution of practical quantum chemistry experiments.

TI Performance analysis for OFDM-based multi-carrier continuous-variable
   quantum key distribution with an arbitrary modulation protocol
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB Multi-carrier continuous-variable quantum key distribution (CV-QKD) is considered to be a promising way to boost the secret key rate (SKR) over the existing single-carrier CV-QKD scheme. However, the extra excess noise induced in the imperfect multi-carrier quantum state preparation process of N subcarriers will limit the performance of the system. Here, a systematic modulation noise model is proposed for the multi-carrier CV-QKD based on the orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM). Subsequently, the performance of multi-carrier CV-QKD with arbitrary modulation protocol (e.g. QPSK, 256QAM and Gaussian modulation protocol) can be quantitatively evaluated by combining the security analysis method of the single-carrier CV-QKD. Under practical system parameters, the simulation results show that the SKR of the multi-carrier CV-QKD can still be significantly improved by increasing the carrier number N even with imperfect practical modulations. Specifically, the total SKR of multi-carrier CV-QKD can be optimized by carefully choosing N. The proposed model provides a feasible theoretical framework for the future multi-carrier CV-QKD experimental implementation.(c) 2023 Optica Publishing Group under the terms of the Optica Open Access Publishing Agreement

TI Separability Criteria Based on the Weyl Operators
SO ENTROPY
AB Entanglement as a vital resource for information processing can be described by special properties of the quantum state. Using the well-known Weyl basis we propose a new Bloch decomposition of the quantum state and study its separability problem. This decomposition enables us to find an alternative characterization of the separability based on the correlation matrix. We show that the criterion is effective in detecting entanglement for the isotropic states, Bell-diagonal states and some PPT entangled states. We also use the Weyl operators to construct an detecting operator for quantum teleportation.

TI Multi-skill resource-constrained multi-modal project scheduling problem
   based on hybrid quantum algorithm
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB Numerous studies on project scheduling only consider a single factor, which fails to reflect the actual environment of project operations. In light of this issue, the article synthesizes multiple perspectives and proposes a multi-skill resource-based multi-modal project scheduling problem (MRCMPSP). This problem is described, modeled, and solved using the resource capability matrix and other constraints to minimize the project duration. To effectively solve MRCMPSP and enrich scheduling algorithms, the paper selects the hybrid quantum algorithm (HQPSO) based on the quantum particle swarm algorithm (QPSO). The HQPSO introduces various improvements such as the JAYA optimization search to improve the algorithm's performance. In order to verify the generality, superiority, and effectiveness of the algorithm, independent operation comparison experiments and practical application experiments of the algorithm are designed based on different case sizes and resource quantities. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm has superior convergence performance and solution accuracy and can provide an effective scheduling solution for real cases. Additionally, the article provides targeted management suggestions based on the research findings. Overall, this study contributes a novel mathematical model, solution algorithm, optimization strategies, and managerial insights, advancing the field of project management research.

TI Microcanonical and finite-temperature ab initio molecular
   dynamics simulations on quantum computers
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) is a powerful tool to predict properties of molecular and condensed matter systems. However, the quality of this procedure relies on the availability of rigorous electronic structure calculations. The development of quantum processors has shown great potential for the efficient evaluation of accurate ground and excited state energies of molecular systems, opening up new avenues for molecular dynamics simulations. In this work, we address the use of variational quantum algorithms for the calculation of accurate atomic forces to be used in AIMD. In particular, we provide solutions for the alleviation of the statistical noise associated with the measurements of the expectation values of energies and forces, as well as schemes for the mitigation of the hardware noise sources (in particular, gate infidelities, qubit decoherence, and readout errors). Despite the relative large error in the calculation of the potential energy, our results show that the proposed algorithms can provide accurate MD trajectories in the microcanonical (constant energy) ensemble. Furthermore, exploiting the intrinsic noise associated to the quantum measurement process, we also propose a Langevin dynamics algorithm for the simulation of canonical, i.e., constant temperature, dynamics. Both algorithms (microcanonical and canonical) are applied to the simulation of simple molecular systems such as H-2 and H-3(+). Finally, we also provide results for the dynamics of H-2 obtained with IBM quantum computer ibmq athens.

TI Demonstration of high-speed and low-complexity continuous variable
   quantum key distribution system with local local oscillator
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB We present an experimental demonstration of the feasibility of the first 20+Mb/s Gaussian modulated coherent state continuous variable quantum key distribution system with a locally generated local oscillator at the receiver (LLO-CVQKD). To increase the signal repetition rate, and hence the potential secure key rate, we equip our system with high-performance, wideband devices and design the components to support high repetition rate operation. We have successfully trialed the signal repetition rate as high as 500 MHz. To reduce the system complexity and correct for any phase shift during transmission, reference pulses are interleaved with quantum signals at Alice. Customized monitoring software has been developed, allowing all parameters to be controlled in real-time without any physical setup modification. We introduce a system-level noise model analysis at high bandwidth and propose a new 'combined-optimization' technique to optimize system parameters simultaneously to high precision. We use the measured excess noise, to predict that the system is capable of realizing a record 26.9 Mb/s key generation in the asymptotic regime over a 15 km signal mode fibre. We further demonstrate the potential for an even faster implementation.

TI Stimulated Emission of Signal Photons from Dark Matter Waves
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB The manipulation of quantum states of light has resulted in significant advancements in both dark matter searches and gravitational wave detectors. Current dark matter searches operating in the microwave frequency range use nearly quantum-limited amplifiers. Future high frequency searches will use photon counting techniques to evade the standard quantum limit. We present a signal enhancement technique that utilizes a superconducting qubit to prepare a superconducting microwave cavity in a nonclassical Fock state and stimulate the emission of a photon from a dark matter wave. By initializing the cavity in an In = 4) Fock state, we demonstrate a quantum enhancement technique that increases the signal photon rate and hence also the dark matter scan rate each by a factor of 2.78. Using this technique, we conduct a dark photon search in a band around 5.965 GHz (24.67 mu eV), where the kinetic mixing angle e >= 4.35 x 10-13 is excluded at the 90% confidence level.

TI Biology and medicine in the landscape of quantum advantages
SO JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY INTERFACE
AB Quantum computing holds substantial potential for applications in biology and medicine, spanning from the simulation of biomolecules to machine learning methods for subtyping cancers on the basis of clinical features. This potential is encapsulated by the concept of a quantum advantage, which is contingent on a reduction in the consumption of a computational resource, such as time, space or data. Here, we distill the concept of a quantum advantage into a simple framework to aid researchers in biology and medicine pursuing the development of quantum applications. We then apply this framework to a wide variety of computational problems relevant to these domains in an effort to (i) assess the potential of practical advantages in specific application areas and (ii) identify gaps that may be addressed with novel quantum approaches. In doing so, we provide an extensive survey of the intersection of biology and medicine with the current landscape of quantum algorithms and their potential advantages. While we endeavour to identify specific computational problems that may admit practical advantages throughout this work, the rapid pace of change in the fields of quantum computing, classical algorithms and biological research implies that this intersection will remain highly dynamic for the foreseeable future.

TI Optimization of CNOT circuits on limited-connectivity architecture
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB A controlled -NOT (CNOT) circuit is the key gadget for entangling qubits in quantum computing systems. However, the qubit connectivity of noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices is constrained by their limited-connectivity architecture. To improve the performance of CNOT circuits on NISQ devices, we investigate the optimization of the size/depth of CNOT circuits under the limited-connectivity architecture. We present a method that can optimize the size of any n-qubit CNOT circuit O( n2 log � ) on any connected graph with minimum degree 8, and prove this bound is optimal for the regular graph. For the near-term sparsely connected structure, we additionally present a method that can optimize the size of any n-qubit CNOT circuit to below 2n2. The numerical experiment shows that our method performs better than state-of-the-art results. Specifically, we present an example to illustrate the applicability of our algorithm. For the grid structure, which is commonly used in current quantum devices, we demonstrate that the depth of any n-qubit CNOT circuit can be optimized to be linear in n with certain ancillary qubits (ancillas). Experimental results indicate that this method has significant improvements compared with all of the existing methods. We additionally test our algorithms on the five-qubit IBMQ devices, and the experiments show that the measurement results of the optimized circuit with our algorithm are more robust to noise compared with the IBM mapping method.

TI Scalable algorithm simplification using quantum AND logic
SO NATURE PHYSICS
AB Implementing quantum algorithms on realistic devices requires translating high-level global operations into sequences of hardware-native logic gates, a process known as quantum compiling. Physical limitations, such as constraints in connectivity and gate alphabets, often result in unacceptable implementation costs. To enable successful near-term applications, it is crucial to optimize compilation by exploiting the capabilities of existing hardware. Here we implement a resource-efficient construction for a quantum version of AND logic that can reduce the compilation overhead, enabling the execution of key quantum circuits. On a high-scalability superconducting quantum processor, we demonstrate low-depth synthesis of high-fidelity generalized Toffoli gates with up to 8 qubits and Grover's search algorithm in a search space of up to 64 entries. Our experimental demonstration illustrates a scalable and widely applicable approach to implementing quantum algorithms, bringing more meaningful quantum applications on noisy devices within reach.
   To run algorithms on a computer they are broken down into logical operations that are implemented in hardware. A quantum logical AND gate has now been demonstrated, which could substantially improve the efficiency of near-term quantum computers.

TI Learning Many-Body Hamiltonians with Heisenberg-Limited Scaling
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB Learning a many-body Hamiltonian from its dynamics is a fundamental problem in physics. In this Letter, we propose the first algorithm to achieve the Heisenberg limit for learning an interacting N-qubit local Hamiltonian. After a total evolution time of O(epsilon-1), the proposed algorithm can efficiently estimate any parameter in the N-qubit Hamiltonian to epsilon error with high probability. Our algorithm uses ideas from quantum simulation to decouple the unknown N-qubit Hamiltonian H into noninteracting patches and learns H using a quantum-enhanced divide-and-conquer approach. The proposed algorithm is robust against state preparation and measurement error, does not require eigenstates or thermal states, and only uses polylog(epsilon-1) experiments. In contrast, the best existing algorithms require O(epsilon-2) experiments and total evolution time. We prove a matching lower bound to establish the asymptotic optimality of our algorithm.

TI Mitigation of correlated readout errors without randomized measurements
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Quantum simulation, the study of strongly correlated quantum matter using synthetic quantum systems, has been the most successful application of quantum computers to date. It often requires determining observables with high precision, for example when studying critical phenomena near quantum phase transitions. Thus, readout errors must be carefully characterized and mitigated in data postprocessing, using scalable and noise-model agnostic protocols. We present a readout error-mitigation protocol that uses only single-qubit Pauli measurements and avoids experimentally challenging randomized measurements. The proposed approach captures a very broad class of correlated noise models and is scalable to large qubit systems. It is based on a complete and efficient characterization of few-qubit correlated positive operator-valued measures, using overlapping detector tomography. To assess the effectiveness of the protocol, observables are extracted from simulations involving up to 100 qubits employing readout errors obtained from experiments with superconducting qubits.

TI Strain in heterogeneous quantum devices with atomic layer deposition
SO MATERIALS FOR QUANTUM TECHNOLOGY
AB We investigated the use of dielectric layers produced by atomic layer deposition (ALD) as an approach to strain mitigation in composite silicon/superconductor devices operating at cryogenic temperatures. We show that the addition of an ALD layer acts to reduce the strain of spins closest to silicon/superconductor interface where strain is highest. We show that appropriately biasing our devices at the hyperfine clock transition of bismuth donors in silicon, we can remove strain broadening and that the addition of ALD layers left T-2 (or temporal inhomogeneities) unchanged in these natural silicon devices.

AB We present undergraduate-friendly instructions on how to produce light pulses propagating through warm Rubidium vapor with speeds less than 400 m/s, i.e., nearly a million times slower than c. We elucidate the role played by electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT) in producing slow light pulses and discuss how to achieve the required experimental conditions. The optical setup is presented, and details provided for preparation of pump, probe, and reference pulses of the required size, frequency, intensity, temporal width, and polarization purity. EIT-based slow light pulses provide the most widely studied architecture for creating quantum memories. Therefore, the basic concepts presented here are useful for physics and engineering majors who wish to get involved in the development of cutting-edge quantum technologies.(c) 2023 Published under an exclusive license by American Association of Physics Teachers.

TI Noisy coherent population trapping: applications to noise estimation and
   qubit state preparation
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICS B-ATOMIC MOLECULAR AND OPTICAL PHYSICS
AB Coherent population trapping is a well-known quantum phenomenon in a driven ? system, with many applications across quantum optics. However, when a stochastic bath is present in addition to vacuum noise, the observed trapping is no longer perfect. Here we derive a time-convolutionless master equation describing the equilibration of the ? system in the presence of additional temporally correlated classical noise, with an unknown decay parameter. Our simulations show a one-to-one correspondence between the decay parameter and the depth of the characteristic dip in the photoluminescence spectrum, thereby enabling the unknown parameter to be estimated from the observed spectra. We apply our analysis to the problem of qubit state initialization in a ? system via dark states and show how the stochastic bath affects the fidelity of such initialization as a function of the desired dark-state amplitudes. We show that an optimum choice of Rabi frequencies is possible.

TI High-Fidelity Two-Qubit Gates between Fluxonium Qubits with a Resonator
   Coupler
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB We take a bottom-up first-principles approach to designing a two-qubit gate between fluxonium qubits for minimal error, speed, and control simplicity. Our proposed architecture consists of two fluxoniums coupled via a resonator. The use of a simple linear coupler has many practical benefits, including the possibility of material optimization for suppressing loss, reducing fabrication complexity, and increasing yield by circumventing the need for Josephson junctions. Crucially, a resonator-as-coupler approach also suggests a clear path to increased connectivity between fluxonium qubits, by reducing capacitive loading when the coupler has a high impedance. After performing analytic and numerical analyses of the circuit Hamiltonian and gate dynamics, we tune circuit parameters to destructively interfere sources of coherent error, revealing an efficient fourth-order scaling of coherent error with gate duration. For component properties from the literature, we predict an open-system average controlled-Z (CZ) gate infidelity of 1.86 x 10-4 in 70 ns.

SO APPLIED PHYSICS EXPRESS
AB This study explores the enhancement of emission from a single photon emitter in a quantum communication network by coupling the source with an optical nanofiber and leveraging gold nanoparticles for Purcell enhancement. Large Purcell enhancements of more than 50 times were recently reported experimentally, but the understanding of important issues, including the maximum Purcell factor and limits to quantum efficiency due to ohmic losses, is still lacking. Our findings reveal that the reported experimental results are reasonable, and confirm that such composite devices provide a promising route for high-efficiency single photon sources coupled to an optical fiber-based quantum communication network.

TI Quantum Neural Networks for a Supply Chain Logistics Application
SO ADVANCED QUANTUM TECHNOLOGIES
AB Problem instances of a size suitable for practical applications are not likely to be addressed during the noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) period with (almost) pure quantum algorithms. Hybrid classical-quantum algorithms have potential, however, to achieve good performance on much larger problem instances. One such hybrid algorithm on a problem of substantial importance: vehicle routing for supply chain logistics with multiple trucks and complex demand structure is investigated. Reinforcement learning with neural networks with embedded quantum circuits is used. In such neural networks, projecting high-dimensional feature vectors down to smaller vectors is necessary to accommodate restrictions on the number of qubits of NISQ hardware. However, a multi-head attention mechanism is used where, even in classical machine learning, such projections are natural and desirable. Data from the truck routing logistics of a company in the automotive sector is considered, and the methodology is applied by decomposing into small teams of trucks and results are found comparable to human truck assignment.

AB This work considers the use of analog quantum machines to solve the boolean satisfiability problem 3SAT by taking Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization models (QUBO) as input. With the aim of using real quantum computers instead of emulators to solve instances of the problem, we choose the D-Wave quantum machines, which have a static topology and limited connectivity. Therefore, the choice of the problem formulation must take these important constraints into account. For this reason, we propose to solve 3SAT instances through polynomial-time reduction to the Maximum Independent Set problem. This is because the resulting graph is less dense and requires lower connectivity than the one that would be produced by directly modeling 3SAT into a QUBO.

TI Performance of surface codes in realistic quantum hardware
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Surface codes are generally studied based on the assumption that each of the qubits that make up the surface code lattice suffers noise that is independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.). However, real benchmarks of the individual relaxation (T1) and dephasing (T2) times of the constituent qubits of state-of-the-art quantum processors have recently shown that the decoherence effects suffered by each particular qubit actually vary in intensity. In consequence, in this paper we introduce the independent nonidentically distributed (i.n.i.d.) noise model, a decoherence model that accounts for the nonuniform behavior of the decoherence parameters of qubits. Additionally, we use the i.n.i.d. model to study how it affects the performance of a specific family of quantum error correction codes known as planar codes. For this purpose we employ data from four state-of-the-art superconducting processors: ibmq_brooklyn, ibm_washington, Zuchongzhi, and Rigetti Aspen-M-1. Our results show that the i.i.d. noise assumption overestimates the performance of surface codes, which can suffer up to 95% performance decrements in terms of the code pseudothreshold when they are subjected to the i.n.i.d. noise model. Furthermore, we consider and describe two methods which enhance the performance of planar codes under i.n.i.d. noise. The first method involves a so-called reweighting process of the conventional minimum weight perfect matching (MWPM) decoder, while the second one exploits the relationship that exists between code performance and qubit arrangement in the surface code lattice. The optimum qubit configuration derived through the combination of the previous two methods can yield planar code pseudothreshold values that are up to 650% higher than for the traditional MWPM decoder under i.n.i.d. noise.

TI Quantum-resilient and adaptive multi-region data aggregation for IoMT
   using zero-knowledge proofs and edge intelligence
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB The Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) transforms healthcare by enabling real-time monitoring of patient vitals, such as heart rate and glucose levels, but faces significant challenges in securing sensitive data against cyber threats and ensuring reliability in resource-constrained wearable devices, like low-power biosensors with limited computational capacity. The rise of quantum computing, particularly Shor algorithm, threatens to break traditional cryptographic methods (e.g., RSA, ECC) within 5-10 years by efficiently solving their underlying mathematical problems, endangering patient data confidentiality. Post-quantum cryptography (PQC), such as lattice-based schemes, offers resilience but demands high computational resources, challenging IoMT scalability. Unlike other PQC IoMT frameworks, such as those using NTRU, which prioritize computational simplicity but lack advanced privacy mechanisms, Q-PRADAX pioneers a secure, adaptive data aggregation framework, integrating Ring-LWE-based PQC for quantum-resilient confidentiality, compact zk-SNARK proofs for tamper-proof verification of patient vitals, and adaptive clustering for enhanced network reliability and scalability. Evaluated using OMNeT + + 6.0.3 with INET 4.5, Q-PRADAX achieves 94.5% diagnostic accuracy on ECG datasets, 100% tampering detection, and 99.9% packet delivery across 1000 devices in its Baseline scenario, with a security latency of 12.2 ms/packet and energy consumption of 0.38 mJ/packet on ARM Cortex-M4 devices (200 mAh). Outperforming existing IoMT solutions in security and fault tolerance, Q-PRADAX establishes a global standard for a secure, patient-centric IoMT ecosystem, redefining reliable healthcare delivery.

AB We present a theoretical investigation, based on the tight-binding Hamiltonian, of efficient second- and third-order nonlinear optical processes in the lattice-matched undoped ( GaP ) N / ( Si 2 ) M short-period superlattice that is waveguide-integrated in a microring resonator on an opto-electronic chip. The nonlinear superlattice structures are situated on the optically pumped input area of a heterogeneous "XOI" chip based on silicon. The spectra of chi(2zzz) ( 2 w , w , w ) , chi(2) xzx ( 2 w , w , w ) , xxxx ( 3 w , w , w , w ) and the Kerr refractive index ( n 2 ), have been simulated as a function of the number of the atomic monolayers for "nonrelaxed" heterointerfaces; These nonlinearities are induced by transitions between valence and conduction bands. The large obtained values make the ( GaP ) N / ( Si 2 ) M short-period superlattice a good candidate for future high-performance XOI photonic integrated chips that may include Si 3 N 4 or SiC or AlGaAs or Si. Near or at the 810nm and 1550-nm wavelengths, we have made detailed calculations of the efficiency of second- and third-harmonic generation as well as the performances of entangled photon-pair quantum sources that are based upon spontaneous parametric down conversion and spontashort-period superlattice is competitive with present technologies and is practical for classical and quantum applications.

AB We study families of dynamical maps generated from interactions with varying degrees of symmetry. For a family of time-independent Hamiltonians, we demonstrate the relationship between symmetry, strong-coupling, perfect entanglers, non-Markovian features, and non-time-locality. We show that by perturbing the initial environment state, effective time-local descriptions can be obtained that are non-singular yet capture essential non-unitary features of the reduced dynamics. We then consider a time-dependent Hamiltonian that changes the degree of symmetry by activating a dormant degree of freedom. In this example we find that the one-qubit reduced dynamics changes dramatically. These results can inform the construction of effective theories of open systems when the larger system dynamics is unknown.

TI Scalable Network for Simultaneous Pairwise Quantum Key Distribution via
   Entanglement-Based Time-Bin Coding
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB We present a scalable star-shaped quantum-key-distribution (QKD) optical-fiber network. We use wavelength-division demultiplexing (WDM) of broadband photon pairs to establish key exchange between multiple pairs of participants simultaneously. Our QKD system is the first entanglement-based network of four participants using BBM92 time-bin coding and the first network to achieve timing synchronization solely by clock recovery based on the photon arrival times. We demonstrate simultaneous bipartite key exchange between any possible combination of participants and show that the quantum bit error rate (QBER) itself can be used to stabilize the phase in the interferometers by small temperature adjustments. The key distribution is insensitive to polarization fluctuations in the network, enabling key distribution using deployed fibers even under challenging environmental conditions. We show that our network can be readily extended to 34 participants by using a standard arrayed-waveguide grating for WDM with 100 GHz channel spacing and that reconfigurable network connections are possible with a wavelength selective switch. In a field test, we demonstrate secure key rates of 6.3 bits/s with a QBER of 4.5% over a total fiber length of 108 km with 26.8 km of deployed fiber between two participants with high stability. Our system features a relatively simple design of the receiver modules and enables scaling QKD networks without trusted nodes to distances up to more than 100 km and to more than 100 users. With such a network, a secure communication infrastructure on a metropolitan scale can be established.

TI Minimal scheme for certifying three-outcome qubit measurements in the
   prepare-and-measure scenario
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB The number of outcomes is a defining property of a quantum measurement, in particular, if the measurement cannot be decomposed into simpler measurements with fewer outcomes. Importantly, the number of outcomes of a quantum measurement can be irreducibly higher than the dimension of the system. The certification of this property is possible in a semi-device-independent way either based on a Bell-like scenario or by utilizing the simpler prepare-and-measure scenario. Here we show that in the latter scenario the minimal scheme for certifying an irreducible three-outcome qubit measurement requires three state preparations and only two measurements and we provide experimentally feasible examples for this minimal certification scheme. We also discuss the dimension assumption characteristic of the semi-device-independent approach and to what extent it can be mitigated.

TI Quantum Merlin-Arthur proof systems for synthesizing quantum states
SO QUANTUM
AB Complexity theory typically focuses on the difficulty of solving computational problems with classical inputs and outputs, even with a quantum computer. In the quantum world, it is natural to apply a different notion of complexity, namely the complexity of synthesizing quantum states. We investigate a state-synthesizing counterpart of the class NP, referred to as stateQMA, which is concerned with preparing certain quantum states through a polynomial-time quantum verifier with the aid of a single quantum message from an all-powerful but untrusted prover. This is a subclass of the class stateQIP recently introduced by Rosenthal and Yuen (ITCS 2022), which permits polynomially many interactions between the prover and the verifier. Our main result consists of error reduction of this class and its variants with an exponentially small gap or bounded space, as well as how this class relates to other fundamental state-synthesizing classes, i.e., states generated by uniform polynomialtime quantum circuits (stateBQP) and space-uniform polynomial-space quantum circuits (statePSPACE). Furthermore, we establish that the family of UQMA witnesses, considered as one of the most natural candidates for stateQMA containments, is in stateQMA. Additionally, we demonstrate that stateQCMA achieves perfect completeness.

TI Characterization of Er3+:YVO4 for microwave to
   optical transduction
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
AB Quantum transduction between microwave and optical frequencies is important for connecting superconducting quantum platforms within a quantum network. Ensembles of rare-earth ions are promising candidates to achieve this conversion due to their collective coherence properties at microwave and optical frequencies. Erbium ions are of particular interest because of their telecom wavelength optical transitions that are compatible with fiber communication networks and components. Here, we report the optical and electron spin properties of erbium-doped yttrium orthovanadate (Er3+:YVO4), including high-resolution optical spectroscopy, electron paramagnetic resonance studies, and an initial demonstration of microwave to optical conversion of classical fields. The highly absorptive optical transitions and narrow ensemble linewidths make Er3+:YVO4 promising for magneto-optic quantum transduction.

AB In classical computing, garbled circuits (and their generalization known as randomized encodings) are a versatile cryptographic tool with many applications such as secure multiparty computation, delegated computation, depth-reduction of cryptographic primitives, complexity lower-bounds, and more. Quantum analogues of garbled circuits were not known prior to this work.
   In this work, we introduce a definition of quantum randomized encodings and present a construction which allows us to efficiently garble any quantum circuit, assuming the existence of quantum-secure one-way functions. Our construction has comparable properties to the best known classical garbling schemes. We can also achieve perfect information-theoretic security albeit with blow-up in the size of the garbled circuits.
   We believe that quantum garbled circuits and quantum randomized encodings can be an instrumental concept and building block for quantum computation and in particular quantum cryptography. We present some applications, including a conceptually-simple zero-knowledge proof system for QMA, a protocol for private simultaneous messages, functional encryption, and more.

TI Entanglement in Quantum Search Database: Periodicity Variations and
   Counting
SO QUANTUM REPORTS
AB Employing the single item search algorithm of N dimensional database it is shown that: First, the entanglement developed between two any-size parts of database space varies periodically during the course of searching. The periodic entanglement of the associated reduced density matrix quantified by several entanglement measures (linear entropy, von Neumann, Renyi), is found to vanish with period O(sqrt(N)). Second, functions of equal entanglement are shown to vary also with equal period. Both those phenomena, based on size-independent database bi-partition, manifest a general scale invariant property of entanglement in quantum search. Third, measuring the entanglement periodicity via the number of searching steps between successive canceling out, determines N, the database set cardinality, quadratically faster than ordinary counting. An operational setting that includes an Entropy observable and its quantum circuits realization is also provided for implementing fast counting. Rigging the marked item initial probability, either by initial advice or by guessing, improves hyper-quadratically the performance of those phenomena.

TI No-Go Theorems for Quantum Resource Purification: New Approach and
   Channel Theory
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB It has been recently shown that there exist universal fundamental limits to the accuracy and efficiency of the transformation from noisy resource states to pure ones (e.g., distillation) in any well-behaved quantum resource theory [Fang and Liu, Phys. Rev. Lett. 125, 060405 (2020)]. Here, we develop a novel and powerful method for analyzing the limitations on quantum resource purification, which not only leads to improved bounds that rule out exact purification for a broader range of noisy states and are tight in certain cases, but also enable us to establish a robust no-purification theory for quantum channel (dynamical) resources. More specifically, we employ the new method to derive universal bounds on the error and cost of transforming generic noisy channels (where multiple instances can be used adaptively, in contrast to the state theory) to some unitary resource channel under any free channel-to-channel map. We address several cases of practical interest in more concrete terms, and discuss the connections and applications of our general results to distillation, quantum error correction, quantum Shannon theory, and quantum circuit synthesis.

TI Er-doped anatase TiO2 thin films on LaAlO3 (001)
   for quantum interconnects (QuICs)
SO APPLIED PHYSICS LETTERS
AB Rare-earth ions (REIs) doped into solid-state crystal hosts offer an attractive platform for realizing quantum interconnects that can function as quantum memories and quantum repeaters. The 4f valence electrons of REIs are shielded by 5s and 5p electrons and undergo highly coherent transitions even when embedded in host crystals. In particular, Er3+ has an optical transition in the telecom band that is suitable for low-loss communication. Recently, REIs in thin film systems have gained interest due to potential advantages in providing a flexible host crystal environment, enabling scalable on-chip integration with other quantum devices. Here, we investigate the structural and optical properties of Er-doped anatase TiO2 thin films on LaAlO3 (001) substrates. By choosing a system with minimal lattice mismatch and adjusting Er-dopant concentration, we achieve optical inhomogeneous linewidths of 5GHz at 4.5K. We show that 9nm-thick buffer and capping layers can reduce the linewidth by more than 40%, suggesting a pathway to further narrowing linewidths in this system. We also identify that Er3+ ions mainly incorporate into substitutional Ti4+ sites with non-polar D-2d symmetry, which makes Er dopants insensitive to the first order to local electric fields from impurities and is desirable for coherence properties of Er3+ spins.

TI Fidelity of wormhole teleportation in finite-qubit systems
SO JOURNAL OF HIGH ENERGY PHYSICS
AB The rapid development of quantum science and technology is leading us into an era where quantum many-body systems can be comprehended through quantum simulations. Holographic duality, which states gravity and spacetime can emerge from strongly interacting systems, then offers a natural avenue for the experimental study of gravity physics without delving into experimentally infeasible high energies. A prominent example is the simulation of traversable wormholes through the wormhole teleportation protocol, attracting both theoretical and experimental attention. In this work, we develop the theoretical framework for computing the fidelity of wormhole teleportation in N-qubit systems with all-to-all interactions, quantified by mutual information and entanglement negativity. The main technique is the scramblon effective theory, which captures universal out-of-time-order correlations in generic chaotic systems. We clarify that strong couplings between the two systems are essential for simulating the probe limit of semi-classical traversable wormholes using strongly interacting systems with near-maximal chaos. However, the teleportation signal diminishes rapidly when reducing the system size N, requiring a large number of qubits to observe a sharp signature of emergent geometry by simulating the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev model. This includes both the causal time-order of signals and the asymmetry of the teleportation signal for coupling with different signs. As a comparison, the teleportation signal increases when reducing N in weakly interacting systems. We also analyze the fidelity of the generalized encoding scheme in fermionic string operators.

TI Charge Parity Rates in Transmon Qubits With Different Shunting
   Capacitors
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON APPLIED SUPERCONDUCTIVITY
AB The presence of non-equilibrium quasiparticles in superconducting resonators and qubits operating at millikelvin temperature has been known for decades. One metric for the number of quasiparticles affecting qubits is the rate of single-electron change in charge on the qubit island (i.e. the charge parity rate). Here, we have utilized a Ramsey-like pulse sequence to monitor changes in the parity states of five transmon qubits. The five qubits have shunting capacitors with two different geometries and fabricated from both Al and Ta. The charge parity rate differs by a factor of two for the two transmon designs studied here but does not depend on the material of the shunting capacitor. The underlying mechanism of the source of parity switching is further investigated in one of the qubit devices by increasing the quasiparticle trapping rate using induced vortices in the electrodes of the device. The charge parity rate exhibited a weak dependence on the quasiparticle trapping rate, indicating that the main source of charge parity events is from the production of quasiparticles across the Josephson junction. To estimate this source of quasiparticle production, we simulate and estimate pair-breaking photon absorption rates for our two qubit geometries and find a similar factor of two in the absorption rate for a background blackbody radiation temperature of $T<^>*\sim$ 350 mK.

TI Noise tailoring for robust amplitude estimation
SO NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB A universal fault-tolerant quantum computer holds the promise to speed up computational problems that are otherwise intractable on classical computers; however, for the next decade or so, our access is restricted to noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) computers and, perhaps, early fault tolerant (EFT) quantum computers. This motivates the development of many near-term quantum algorithms including robust amplitude estimation (RAE), which is a quantum-enhanced algorithm for estimating expectation values. One obstacle to using RAE has been a paucity of ways of getting realistic error models incorporated into this algorithm. So far the impact of device noise on RAE is incorporated into one of its subroutines as an exponential decay model, which is unrealistic for NISQ devices and, maybe, for EFT devices; this hinders the performance of RAE. Rather than trying to explicitly model realistic noise effects, which may be infeasible, we circumvent this obstacle by tailoring device noise using randomized compiling to generate an effective noise model, whose impact on RAE closely resembles that of the exponential decay model. Using noisy simulations, we show that our noise-tailored RAE algorithm is able to regain improvements in both bias and precision that are expected for RAE. Additionally, on IBM's quantum computer ibmq_belem our algorithm demonstrates advantage over the standard estimation technique in reducing bias. Thus, our work extends the feasibility of RAE on NISQ computers, consequently bringing us one step closer towards achieving quantum advantage using these devices.

TI Hybrid quantum neural network models for fruit quality assessment
SO PLOS ONE
AB This study investigates hybrid quantum neural networks for fruit quality assessment, with a focus on the impact of the entangling gate choice. Two architectures were developed: NNQEv1, utilizing controlled-NOT (CNOT) gates, and NNQEv2, employing controlled-phase (CZ) gates. A theoretical justification is provided, based on gate decomposition and hardware-aware noise considerations, suggesting the CZ-based architecture is likely to be more stable. The performance of the models was evaluated through the computational execution of their quantum circuits on classical hardware and compared against classical and state-of-the-art deep learning models. The proposed models demonstrated competitive performance, achieving test accuracies of 98.7% on MNIST, 98.6% on the FruitQ dataset, and 96.7% on a custom, data-scarce Apple dataset. The experimental results align with the theoretical analysis: the CZ-based NNQEv2 model, when compared to the CNOT-based NNQEv1, consistently showed more stable training dynamics and yielded tighter confidence intervals in cross-validation. This work presents a foundational, computational study on the role of gate-level design choices, intended to inform the development of future quantum machine learning algorithms.

TI Quantum radio astronomy: Quantum linear solvers for redundant baseline

AB The computational requirements of future large scale radio telescopes are expected to scale well beyond the capabilities of conventional digital resources. Current and planned telescopes are generally limited in their scientific potential by their ability to efficiently process the vast volumes of generated data. To mitigate this problem, we investigate the viability of emerging quantum computers for radio astronomy applications. In this a paper we demonstrate the potential use of variational quantum linear solvers in Noisy Intermediate Scale Quantum (NISQ) computers and combinatorial solvers in quantum annealers for a radio astronomy calibration pipeline. While we demonstrate that these approaches can lead to satisfying results when integrated in calibration pipelines, we show that current restrictions of quantum hardware limit their applicability and performance.

TI Syndrome-Based Min-Sum vs OSD-0 Decoders: FPGA Implementation and
   Analysis for Quantum LDPC Codes
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB Quantum processors need to improve their reliability to scale up the number of qubits and increase the number of algorithms that can execute. To reduce the logical error rate of the quantum systems, the use of error correction codes and decoders has been established as a low-cost and feasible approach, with good results from a theoretical perspective, for mid and long-term architectures. While most of the authors are focused on the algorithms to improve the correction capability of quantum computers, without taking into account a fundamental implementation aspect for their deployment in a real system, i.e., their latency must be bounded to avoid the qubit decoherence, only a few propose hardware architectures and they just include time estimations of their decoding latency. However, a real implementation has not been shown yet. In this work, we analyze from the point of view of hardware implementation two algorithmic options based on quantum low-density parity-check (QLDPC) codes: a) belief propagation min-sum decoders combined with codes with good error-floor behavior and b) belief propagation min-sum decoders concatenated with ordered statistics decoders (OSDs) for codes with early error-floor. The bounds for the maximum clock frequency required by the decoders to decode within the qubit coherence time are established as a parameter to show if a practical implementation is possible with the present or near future FPGA technology. Furthermore, real implementation results for a Xilinx FPGA device are provided, showing that some solutions can meet the timing constraints set up by the state-of-the-art quantum processors.

TI Fault-tolerant connection of error-corrected qubits with noisy links
SO NPJ QUANTUM INFORMATION
AB One of the most promising routes toward scalable quantum computing is a modular approach. We show that distinct surface code patches can be connected in a fault-tolerant manner even in the presence of substantial noise along their connecting interface. We quantify analytically and numerically the combined effect of errors across the interface and bulk. We show that the system can tolerate 14 times higher noise at the interface compared to the bulk, with only a small effect on the code's threshold and subthreshold behavior, reaching threshold with similar to 1% bulk errors and similar to 10% interface errors. This implies that fault-tolerant scaling of error-corrected modular devices is within reach using existing technology.

TI Quantum Rabi interferometry of motion and radiation
SO QUANTUM
AB The precise determination of a displacement of a mechanical oscillator or a mi-crowave field in a predetermined direction in phase space can be carried out with trapped ions or superconducting circuits, respectively, by coupling the oscillator with ancilla qubits. Through that coupling, the displacement information is transferred to the qubits which are then subsequently read out. However, unambiguous estimation of displacement in an unknown direction in the phase space has not been attempted in such oscillator-qubit systems. Here, we propose a hybrid oscillator-qubit interferomet-ric setup for the unambiguous estimation of phase space displacements in an arbitrary direction, based on feasible Rabi interactions beyond the rotating-wave approxima-tion. Using such a hybrid Rabi interferometer for quantum sensing, we show that the performance is superior to the ones attained by single-mode estimation schemes and a conventional interferometer based on Jaynes-Cummings interactions. Moreover, we find that the sensitivity of the Rabi interferometer is independent of the thermal oc-cupation of the oscillator mode, and thus cooling it to the ground state before sensing is not required. We also perform a thorough investigation of the effect of qubit de -phasing and oscillator thermalization. We find the interferometer to be fairly robust, outperforming different benchmark estimation schemes even for large dephasing and thermalization.

TI Polarization Dynamics of Solid-State Quantum Emitters
SO ACS NANO
AB Quantum emitters in solid-state crystals have recently attracted a great deal of attention due to their simple applicability in optical quantum technologies. The polarization of single photons generated by quantum emitters is one of the key parameters that plays a crucial role in various applications, such as quantum computation, which uses the indistinguishability of photons. However, the degree of single-photon polarization is typically quantified using the time-averaged photoluminescence intensity of single emitters, which provides limited information about the dipole properties in solids. In this work, we use single defects in hexagonal boron nitride and nanodiamond as efficient room-temperature single-photon sources to reveal the origin and temporal evolution of the dipole orientation in solid-state quantum emitters. The angles of the excitation and emission dipoles relative to the crystal axes were determined experimentally and then calculated using density functional theory, which resulted in characteristic angles for every specific defect that can be used as an efficient tool for defect identification and understanding their atomic structure. Moreover, the temporal polarization dynamics revealed a strongly modified linear polarization visibility that depends on the excited-state decay time of the individual excitation. This effect can potentially be traced back to the excitation of excess charges in the local crystal environment. Understanding such hidden time-dependent mechanisms can further improve the performance of polarization-sensitive experiments, particularly that for quantum communication with single-photon emitters.

TI Accelerating the variational quantum eigensolver using parallelism
SO QUANTUM SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB Quantum computers are getting larger and larger, but device fidelities may not be able to keep up with the increase in qubit numbers. One way to make use of a large device that has a limited gate depth is to run many small circuits simultaneously. In this paper we detail our investigations into running circuits in parallel on the Rigetti Aspen-M-1 device. We run two-qubit circuits in parallel to solve a simple instance of the Hubbard model using the variational quantum eigensolver (VQE). We present results for running up to 33 circuits in parallel (66 qubits), showing that with the use of error mitigation techniques it is possible to make use of, and gain a real-time speedup from, parallelisation on current quantum hardware. We obtain a speedup by 18x for exploring the VQE energy landscape, and by more than 8x for running VQE optimisation.

TI Comparing three generations of D-Wave quantum annealers for minor
   embedded combinatorial optimization problems
SO QUANTUM SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB Quantum annealing (QA) is a novel type of analog computation that aims to use quantum mechanical fluctuations to search for optimal solutions of Ising problems. QA in the transverse Ising model, implemented on D-Wave quantum processing units, are available as cloud computing resources. In this study we report concise benchmarks across three generations of D-Wave quantum annealers, consisting of four different devices, for the NP-hard discrete combinatorial optimization problems unweighted maximum clique and unweighted maximum cut on random graphs. The Ising, or equivalently quadratic unconstrained binary optimization, formulation of these problems do not require auxiliary variables for order reduction, and their overall structure and weights are not highly variable, which makes these problems simple test cases to understand the sampling capability of current D-Wave quantum annealers. All-to-all minor embeddings of size 52, with relatively uniform chain lengths, are used for a direct comparison across the Chimera, Pegasus, and Zephyr device topologies. A grid-search over annealing times and the minor embedding chain strengths is performed in order to determine the level of reasonable performance for each device and problem type. Experiment metrics that are reported are approximation ratios for non-broken chain samples, chain break proportions, and time-to-solution for the maximum clique problem instances. How fairly the quantum annealers sample optimal maximum cliques, for instances which contain multiple maximum cliques, is quantified using entropy of the measured ground state distributions. The newest generation of quantum annealing hardware, which has a Zephyr hardware connectivity, performed the best overall with respect to approximation ratios and chain break frequencies.

TI An Off-Resonant Quantum Collision Model: Realizing a Qubit Coupled with
   an Effective Negative-Temperature Bath
SO CHINESE PHYSICS LETTERS
AB The quantum collision model provides a promising tool for investigating system-bath dynamics. Most studies of quantum collision models, however, are in the resonant regime. In quantum dynamics, the off-resonant interactions often result in exciting effects. Therefore, it is important to investigate the quantum collision models in the off-resonant regime. A bath with a negative absolute temperature is expected to be instrumental in the development of thermal devices. The design of an effective bath with negative absolute temperature coupled to a qubit is a significant component for developing such thermal devices. In this study, we establish an effective negative-absolute-temperature bath coupled to a qubit with a quantum collision model in the far-off-resonant regime. We conduct a detailed systematic investigation of the off-resonant collision model and determine the presence of an additional constraint on the collision duration resulting from the far-off resonant collision. The dynamics of the collision model in the far-off-resonant regime are different from those beyond the far-off-resonant regime. Numerical simulations are used to confirm the validity of the proposed approach.

TI Integrated mode-hop-free tunable lasers at 780 nm for chip-scale
   classical and quantum photonic applications
SO APL PHOTONICS
AB In the past decade, remarkable advances in integrated photonic technologies have enabled table-top experiments and instrumentation to be scaled down to compact chips with significant reduction in size, weight, power consumption, and cost. Here, we demonstrate an integrated continuously tunable laser in a heterogeneous gallium arsenide-on-silicon nitride (GaAs-on-SiN) platform that emits in the far-red radiation spectrum near 780 nm, with 20 nm tuning range, <6 kHz intrinsic linewidth, and a >40 dB side-mode suppression ratio. The GaAs optical gain regions are heterogeneously integrated with low-loss SiN waveguides. The narrow linewidth lasing is achieved with an extended cavity consisting of a resonator-based Vernier mirror and a phase shifter. Utilizing synchronous tuning of the integrated heaters, we show mode-hop-free wavelength tuning over a range larger than 100 GHz (200 pm). To demonstrate the potential of the device, we investigate two illustrative applications: (i) the linear characterization of a silicon nitride microresonator designed for entangled-photon pair generation and (ii) the absorption spectroscopy and locking to the D-1 and D-2 transition lines of Rb-87. The performance of the proposed integrated laser holds promise for a broader spectrum of both classical and quantum applications in the visible range, encompassing communication, control, sensing, and computing.

TI Diversifying Investments and Maximizing Sharpe Ratio: A Novel Quadratic
   Unconstrained Binary Optimization Formulation
SO QUANTUM REPORTS
AB The optimization of investment portfolios represents a pivotal task within the field of financial economics. Its objective is to identify asset combinations that meet specified criteria for return and risk. Traditionally, the maximization of the Sharpe Ratio, often achieved through quadratic programming, has constituted a popular approach for this purpose. However, real-world scenarios frequently necessitate more complex considerations, particularly in relation to portfolio diversification with a view to mitigating sector-specific risks and enhancing stability. The incorporation of diversification alongside the Sharpe Ratio into the optimization model creates a joint optimization task, which can be formulated as Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) and addressed using quantum annealing or hybrid computing techniques. These techniques offer promising solutions. We present a novel QUBO formulation for this optimization, detailing its mathematical formulation and demonstrating its advantages over classical methods, particularly in handling diversification objectives. By leveraging available QUBO solvers and hybrid approaches, we explore the feasibility of handling large-scale problems while highlighting the importance of diversification in achieving robust portfolio performance. We finally elaborate on the results showing the trade-off between the observed values of the portfolio's Sharpe Ratio and diversification, as a natural consequence of solving a multi-objective optimization problem.

TI Light-injection attack against practical continuous-variable
   measurement-device-independent quantum key distribution systems
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB Continuous-variable measurement-device-independent quantum key distribution (CV-MDI QKD) can defend all detection-side attacks effectively. Therefore, the source side is the final battlefield for performing quantum hacking attacks. This paper investigates the practical security of a CV-MDI QKD system under a light-injection attack. Here, we first describe two different light-injection attacks, i.e., the induced-photorefractive attack and the strong-power injection attack. Then, we consider three attack cases where Eve only attacks one of the parties or both parties of the CV-MDI QKD system. Based on the analysis of the parameter estimation, we find that the legitimate communication parties will overestimate the secret key rate of the system under the effect of a light-injection attack. This opens a security loophole for Eve to successfully obtain secret key information in a practical CV-MDI QKD system. In particular, compared to the laser-damage attack, the above attacks use a lower power of injected light and have a more serious effect on the security of the system. To eliminate the above effects, we can enhance the practical security of the system by doping the lithium niobate material with various impurities or by using protective devices, such as optical isolators, circulators, optical power limiters, and narrow-band filters. Apart from these, we can also use an intensity monitor or a photodetector to detect the light-injection attack.

TI Cryogenic multiplexing using selective area grown nanowires
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Bottom-up grown nanomaterials play an integral role in the development of quantum technologies but are often challenging to characterise on large scales. Here, we harness selective area growth of semiconductor nanowires to demonstrate large-scale integrated circuits and characterisation of large numbers of quantum devices. The circuit consisted of 512 quantum devices embedded within multiplexer/demultiplexer pairs, incorporating thousands of interconnected selective area growth nanowires operating under deep cryogenic conditions. Multiplexers enable a range of new strategies in quantum device research and scaling by increasing the device count while limiting the number of connections between room-temperature control electronics and the cryogenic samples. As an example of this potential we perform a statistical characterization of large arrays of identical quantum dots thus establishing the feasibility of applying cross-bar gating strategies for efficient scaling of future selective area growth quantum circuits. More broadly, the ability to systematically characterise large numbers of devices provides new levels of statistical certainty to materials/device development.
   The authors demonstrate a large ensemble of quantum dots which is characterized using a cryogenic multiplexer-demultiplexer circuit based on selective area growth nanowires, establishing the feasibility of scaling future quantum circuits.

TI Localized π Surface States on 2D Molybdenum Disulfide from
   Carbene-Functionalization as a Qubit Design Strategy
SO ACS PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY AU
AB Surface chemistry is increasingly important for a number of applications, from catalysis to molecular qubits. For the qubit application, it is imperative that the energy levels of surface species involved in the process of interest are energetically distinct-that is addressable and not buried below or coincident with the substrate energy levels. One way to afford this is through chemical functionalization with derivatives that impart the property of choice to the interface. In this Letter, we report on the nature of the bond between a carbene moiety and an MoS2 surface. With density functional theory (DFT) and spin-polarized calculations, we first observe states in the band structure that pertain to the carbene group and then prove their origin. Importantly, we find localized pi-states in the band gap that are due to pi-electrons that are part of a diene attached to the carbene carbon and are not available in bonding configurations without the pi conjugation. These lead to open-shell monocationic structures involving midgap HOMOs with densities on the carbene moiety. Both neutral and cationic forms of the carbenes are energetically separate from the MoS2 substrate, thus useful for optical manipulation. We explore several different choices of the carbene moieties, and show that those based on fused thiophene and bithiophene structures are the most favorable for localization, while purely carbon-based aromatic structures lead to states that are delocalized onto the MoS2 and thus less useful. These findings are potentially of interest to the design and synthesis of future molecular qubit candidates for device fabrication.

On the other hand, the complexity of the even-odd parity based asymptotic-preserving (AP) schemes do not depend on & epsilon;. This indicates that in quantum computing, AP schemes (and probably other multiscale ones) are of great importance for solving multiscale transport and kinetic equations.

TI Accurate non-covalent interaction energies on noisy intermediate-scale
   quantum computers via second-order symmetry-adapted perturbation
   theory
SO CHEMICAL SCIENCE
AB The calculation of non-covalent interaction energies on noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) computers appears to be challenging with straightforward application of existing quantum algorithms. For example, the use of the standard supermolecular method with the variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) would require extremely precise resolution of the total energies of the fragments to provide for accurate subtraction to the interaction energy. Here we present a symmetry-adapted perturbation theory (SAPT) method that may provide interaction energies with high quantum resource efficiency. Of particular note, we present a quantum extended random-phase approximation (ERPA) treatment of the SAPT second-order induction and dispersion terms, including exchange counterparts. Together with previous work on first-order terms (Chem. Sci., 2022, 13, 3094), this provides a recipe for complete SAPT(VQE) interaction energies up to second order, which is a well established truncation. The SAPT interaction energy terms are computed as first-level observables with no subtraction of monomer energies invoked, and the only quantum observations needed are the VQE one- and two-particle density matrices. We find empirically that SAPT(VQE) can provide accurate interaction energies even with coarsely optimized, low circuit depth wavefunctions from a quantum computer, simulated through ideal statevectors. The errors of the total interaction energy are orders of magnitude lower than the corresponding VQE total energy errors of the monomer wavefunctions. In addition, we present heme-nitrosyl model complexes as a system class for near term quantum computing simulations. They are strongly correlated, biologically relevant and difficult to simulate with classical quantum chemical methods. This is illustrated with density functional theory (DFT) as the predicted interaction energies exhibit a strong sensitivity with respect to the choice of functional. Thus, this work paves the way to obtain accurate interaction energies on a NISQ-era quantum computer with few quantum resources. It is the first step in alleviating one of the major challenges in quantum chemistry, where in-depth knowledge of both the method and system is required a priori to reliably generate accurate interaction energies.

TI The Informational Universe of Allah: An Islamic Perspective on Quantum
   Information Theory
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ISLAMIC THOUGHT
AB This scholarly inquiry initiates a nuanced exploration into the Islamic conceptualization of Allah as 'Al-`Alim (the All-Knowing) and 'Al-Khabir' (the All-Aware), postulating a reconciliation wherein Allah is identified as the quintessential Intelligence and truth. Allah's attributes of divine omniscience and ubiquitous awareness underscore a divine understanding enveloping all of existence, positioning Him as the epitome of AllInformation. This paper delves into the intersection of Islamic theological constructs and modern information theory, proposing a novel interpretation that aligns Allah's divine omniscience with the theory's principles. Information theory posits that the foundation of all information is inherently probabilistic, mirroring the probabilistic outcomes observed in quantum mechanics. This seemingly contradicts 'Al-Qadar', an All-Knowing Allah's predetermined will or predestination. However, we can bridge this gap by considering Allah as the embodiment of all information. This paper facilitates a richer understanding of Allah's predetermined will in Islam and builds bridges with the randomness and unpredictable nature witnessed in the quantum world. This research aims to augment Allah as the Infinite Information through an interdisciplinary lens, bridging quantum indeterminacy and Islamic Omnipotence.

TI Observation of Two-Mode Squeezing in a Traveling Wave Parametric
   Amplifier
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB Traveling wave parametric amplifiers (TWPAs) have recently emerged as essential tools for broadband near quantum-limited amplification. However, their use to generate microwave quantum states still misses an experimental demonstration. In this Letter, we report operation of a TWPA as a source of two-mode squeezed microwave radiation. We demonstrate broadband entanglement generation between two modes separated by up to 400 MHz by measuring logarithmic negativity between 0.27 and 0.51 and collective quadrature squeezing below the vacuum limit between 1.5 and 2.1 dB. This work opens interesting perspectives for the exploration of novel microwave photonics experiments with possible applications in quantum sensing and continuous variable quantum computing.

TI Cross-Cross Resonance Gate
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB The implementation of high-fidelity swapping operations is of vital importance for executing quantum algorithms on a quantum processor with limited connectivity. We present an efficient pulse-control technique, the cross-cross resonance (CCR) gate, to implement iSWAP and SWAP gates with dispersively coupled fixed-frequency transmon qubits. The key to the operation of the CCR gate is the simultaneous driving of both of the coupled qubits at the frequency of another qubit, whereby a fast two-qubit interaction roughly equivalent to ZX + XZ entangling gates is realized without strongly driving the qubits. We develop a calibration technique for the CCR gate and evaluate the performance of the iSWAP and SWAP gates. The CCR gate shows remarkable improvements in the average gate error from the conventional decomposition based on the cross-resonance gate.

TI 780 nm Narrow Linewidth External Cavity Diode Laser for Quantum Sensing
SO SENSORS
AB To meet the demands of laser communication, quantum precision measurement, cold atom technology, and other fields for narrow linewidth and low-noise light sources, an external cavity diode laser (ECDL) operating in the wavelength range around 780 nm was set up with a Fabry-P & eacute;rot etalon (F-P) and an interference filter (IF) in the experiment. The interference filter type ECDL (IF-ECDL) with butterfly-style packaging configuration has continuous wavelength tuning within a specified range through precise temperature and current control and has excellent single-mode characteristics. Experimental results indicate that the output power of the IF-ECDL is 14 mW, with a side-mode suppression ratio (SMSR) of 54 dB, a temperature-controlled mode-hop-free tuning range of 527 GHz (1.068 nm), and an output linewidth of 570 Hz. Compared to traditional lasers operating at 780 nm, the IF-ECDL exhibits narrower linewidth, lower noise, and higher spectral purity, and its dimensions are merely 25 x 15 x 8.5 mm3 weighing only 19.8 g, showcasing remarkable miniaturization and lightweight advantages over similar products in current research fields.

TI Control of the von Neumann Entropy for an Open Two-Qubit System Using
   Coherent and Incoherent Drives
SO ENTROPY
AB This article is devoted to developing an approach for manipulating the von Neumann entropy S(rho(t)) of an open two-qubit system with coherent control and incoherent control inducing time-dependent decoherence rates. The following goals are considered: (a) minimizing or maximizing the final entropy S(rho(T)); (b) steering S(rho(T)) to a given target value; (c) steering S(rho(T)) to a target value and satisfying the pointwise state constraint S(rho(t))<= S over bar for a given S over bar ; (d) keeping S(rho(t)) constant at a given time interval. Under the Markovian dynamics determined by a Gorini-Kossakowski-Sudarshan-Lindblad type master equation, which contains coherent and incoherent controls, one- and two-step gradient projection methods and genetic algorithm have been adapted, taking into account the specifics of the objective functionals. The corresponding numerical results are provided and discussed.

TI Error Mitigation in the NISQ Era: Applying Measurement Error Mitigation
   Techniques to Enhance Quantum Circuit Performance
SO MATHEMATICS
AB In quantum computing, noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices offer unprecedented computational capabilities but are vulnerable to errors, notably measurement inaccuracies that impact computation accuracy. This study explores the efficacy of error mitigation techniques in improving quantum circuit performance on NISQ devices. Techniques such as dynamic decoupling (DD), twirled readout error extraction (T-REx) and zero-noise extrapolation (ZNE) are examined through extensive experimentation on an ideal simulator, IBM Kyoto, and IBM Osaka quantum computers. Results reveal significant performance discrepancies across scenarios, with error mitigation techniques notably enhancing both estimator result and variance values, aligning more closely with ideal simulator outcomes. The comparison results with ideal simulator (having expected result value 0.8284) shows that T-Rex has improved results on IBM Kyoto and enhanced average expected result value from 0.09 to 0.35. Similarly, DD has improved average expected result values from 0.2492 to 0.3788 on IBM Osaka. These findings underscore the critical role of error mitigation in bolstering quantum computation reliability. The results suggest that selection of mitigation technique depends upon quantum circuit and its depth, type of hardware and operations to be performed.

TI Extending the time of coherent optical response in ensemble of
   singly-charged InGaAs quantum dots
SO COMMUNICATIONS PHYSICS
AB The ability to extend the time scale of the coherent optical response from large ensembles of quantum emitters is highly appealing for applications in quantum information devices. In semiconductor nanostructures, spin degrees of freedom can be used as auxiliary, powerful tools to modify the coherent optical dynamics. Here, we apply this approach to negatively charged (In,Ga)As/GaAs self-assembled quantum dots which are considered as excellent quantum emitters with robust optical coherence and high bandwidth. We study three-pulse spin-dependent photon echoes subject to moderate transverse magnetic fields up to 1 T. We demonstrate that the timescale of coherent optical response can be extended by at least an order of magnitude by the field. Without magnetic field, the photon echo decays with T-2 = 0.45 ns which is determined by the radiative lifetime of trions T-1 = 0.26 ns. In the presence of the transverse magnetic field, the decay of the photon echo signal is given by spin dephasing time of the ensemble of resident electrons T-2,T-e similar to 4 ns. We demonstrate that the non-zero transverse g-factor of the heavy holes in the trion state plays a crucial role in the temporal evolution and magnetic field dependence of the long-lived photon echo signal.
   Semiconductor nanostructures are central to the implementation of quantum communication and information technologies. The authors leveraged spin degrees of freedom in quantum dot ensembles to increase optical coherence timescales, thereby disclosing intriguing solutions for future quantum memories.

TI Deterministic and reconfigurable graph state generation with a single
   solid-state quantum emitter
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Measurement-based quantum computing offers a promising route towards scalable, universal photonic quantum computation. This approach relies on the deterministic and efficient generation of photonic graph states in which many photons are mutually entangled with various topologies. Recently, deterministic sources of graph states have been demonstrated with quantum emitters in both the optical and microwave domains. In this work, we demonstrate deterministic and reconfigurable graph state generation with optical solid-state integrated quantum emitters. Specifically, we use a single semiconductor quantum dot in a cavity to generate caterpillar graph states, the most general type of graph state that can be produced with a single emitter. By using fast detuned optical pulses, we achieve full control over the spin state, enabling us to vary the entanglement topology at will. We perform quantum state tomography of two successive photons, measuring Bell state fidelities up to 0.80 +/- 0.04 and concurrences up to 0.69 +/- 0.09, while maintaining high photon indistinguishability. This simple optical scheme, compatible with commercially available quantum dot-based single photon sources, brings us a step closer to fault-tolerant quantum computing with spins and photons.

TI Exploring the teleported information in two two-level atoms interacting
   with a deformed cavity field
SO ALEXANDRIA ENGINEERING JOURNAL
AB The possibility of teleporting a single-qubit system in an atomic system that interacts with a deformed cavity mode is being discussed. The average fidelity is used to investigate the quality of the teleported information in either ideal or deformed cavity. The quantum Fisher information is used as an estimator for the weight and phase angle parameters of the initial input state. The study shows that maximizing/minimizing the estimation degree and fidelity depends on the initial state settings of the atomic system, dipole-dipole coupling, and the estimated parameters. To maximize the information in the presence of a deformed cavity, one has to set large values of the atomic coupling dipole subsystem and reduce the deformation parameter. (c) 2023 THE AUTHORS.

TI Photon-pair blockade in a Josephson-photonics circuit with two
   nondegenerate microwave resonators
SO NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB We propose to generate photon-pair blockade in a Josephson-photonics circuit that consists of a dc voltage-biased Josephson junction in series with a superconducting charge qubit and two nondegenerate microwave resonators. The two-level charge qubit is utilized to create anticorrelations of the charge transport; that is, the simultaneous Cooper pair tunneling events are inhibited. When the Josephson frequency matches the sum of resonance frequencies of the charge qubit and the two resonators, we demonstrate that the two resonators can release their energies in the form of antibunched pairs of two strongly correlated photons. The present work provides a practical way for producing a bright microwave source of antibunched photon pairs, with potential applications ranging from spectroscopy and metrology to quantum information processing.

TI Full control of superconducting qubits with combined on-chip microwave
   and flux lines
SO APPLIED PHYSICS LETTERS
AB As the field of quantum computing progresses to larger-scale devices, multiplexing will be crucial to scale quantum processors. While multi-plexed readout is common practice for superconducting devices, relatively little work has been reported about the combination of flux and microwave control lines. Here, we present a method to integrate a microwave line and a flux line into a single "XYZ line." This combined control line allows us to perform fast single-qubit gates as well as to deliver flux signals to the qubits. The measured relaxation times of the qubits are comparable to state-of-the-art devices employing separate control lines. We benchmark the fidelity of single-qubit gates with randomized benchmarking, achieving a fidelity as high as 99.9360.04%, and we demonstrate that XYZ lines can in principle be used to run parametric entangling gates.

Specifically, simulations performed of systems with up to 12 neutrinos using Quantinuum's H1-1 20 qubit trapped-ion quantum computer are used to compute n-tangles, and two- and three-body correlations, probing beyond mean-field descriptions. n-tangle rescalings are found to converge for large system sizes, signaling the presence of genuine multi-neutrino entanglement.

TI Quantum-centric supercomputing for materials science: A perspective on
   challenges and future directions
SO FUTURE GENERATION COMPUTER SYSTEMS-THE INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ESCIENCE
AB Computational models are an essential tool for the design, characterization, and discovery of novel materials. Computationally hard tasks in materials science stretch the limits of existing high-performance supercomputing centers, consuming much of their resources for simulation, analysis, and data processing. Quantum computing, on the other hand, is an emerging technology with the potential to accelerate many of the computational tasks needed for materials science. In order to do that, the quantum technology must interact with conventional highperformance computing in several ways: approximate results validation, identification of hard problems, and synergies in quantum-centric supercomputing. In this paper, we provide a perspective on how quantum-centric supercomputing can help address critical computational problems in materials science, the challenges to face in order to solve representative use cases, and new suggested directions.

TI A quantum procedure for estimating information gain in Boolean
   classification task
SO QUANTUM MACHINE INTELLIGENCE
AB A substantial portion of global quantum computing research has been conducted using quantum mechanics, which recently has been applied to quantum computers. However, the design of a quantum algorithm requires a comprehensive understanding of quantum mechanics and physical procedures. This work presents a quantum procedure for estimating information gain. It is aimed at making quantum computing accessible to those without preliminary knowledge of quantum mechanics. The procedure can be a basis for building data mining processes according to measures from information theory using quantum computers. The main advantage of this procedure is the use of amplitude encoding and the inner product of two quantum states to calculate the conditional entropy between two vectors. The method was implemented using the IBM simulator and tested over a dataset of six features and a Boolean target variable. The results showed a correlation of 0.942 between the ranks achieved by the classical and quantum computations with a significance of p < 0.005.

TI Endless fun in high dimensions-A quantum card game
SO AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB Quantum technologies enable new ways to distribute and process information. The enormous progress over the recent decades has led to an urgent need for new educational programs to train professionals to work in this field. Here, we present a card game that teaches students the building blocks of quantum computing through strategic gameplay. Participants start from the lowest quantum state and play cards that change their state and/or their opponents' state, aiming to build an algorithm that achieves the highest possible quantum state. Players can utilize several different strategies that rely on quantum features such as randomness, superposition, interference, and entanglement. Our game expands on the existing Q | Cards ? game, originally developed using traditional qubits (with 2-level states), by including an option to play with qutrits (with 3-level states), and by developing cooperative and single player modes in addition to the existing competitive mode. The presented game contributes to the ongoing efforts on gamifying quantum physics education with a particular focus on the counter-intuitive features that make quantum computing powerful.

TI Millikelvin temperature cryo-CMOS multiplexer for scalable quantum
   device characterisation
SO QUANTUM SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB Quantum computers based on solid state qubits have been a subject of rapid development in recent years. In current noisy intermediate-scale quantum technology, each quantum device is controlled and characterised through a dedicated signal line between room temperature and base temperature of a dilution refrigerator. This approach is not scalable and is currently limiting the development of large-scale quantum system integration and quantum device characterisation. Here we demonstrate a custom designed cryo-CMOS multiplexer operating at 32 mK. The multiplexer exhibits excellent microwave properties up to 10 GHz at room and millikelvin temperatures. We have increased the characterisation throughput with the multiplexer by measuring four high-quality factor superconducting resonators using a single input and output line in a dilution refrigerator. Our work lays the foundation for large-scale microwave quantum device characterisation and has the perspective to address the wiring problem of future large-scale quantum computers.

TI Quantifying information flow in quantum processes
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB We present a framework for quantifying information flow within general quantum processes. For this purpose, we introduce the signaling power of quantum channels and discuss its relevant operational properties. This function supports extensions to higher-order maps, enabling the evaluation of information flow in general quantum causal networks and processes with indefinite causal order. Furthermore, our results offer a rigorous approach to information dynamics in open systems that applies also in the presence of initial system-environment correlations, and allows for the distinction between classical and quantum information backflow.

TI Time-reversal in a dipolar quantum many-body spin system
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Time reversal in a macroscopic system contradicts daily experience. It is practically impossible to restore a shattered cup to its original state by just time reversing the microscopic dynamics that led to its breakage. Yet, with the precise control capabilities provided by modern quantum technology, the unitary evolution of a quantum system can be reversed in time. Here, we implement a time-reversal protocol in a dipolar interacting, isolated many-body spin system represented by Rydberg states in an atomic gas. By changing the states encoding the spin, we flip the sign of the interaction Hamiltonian, and demonstrate the reversal of the relaxation dynamics of the magnetization by letting a demagnetized many-body state evolve back in time into a magnetized state. We elucidate the role of atomic motion using the concept of a Loschmidt echo. Finally, by combining the approach with Floquet engineering, we demonstrate time reversal for a large family of spin models with different symmetries. Our method of state transfer is applicable across a wide range of quantum simulation platforms and has applications far beyond quantum many-body physics, reaching from quantum-enhanced sensing to quantum information scrambling.

TI Equivariant Variational Quantum Eigensolver to detect phase transitions
   through energy level crossings
SO QUANTUM SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB Level spectroscopy stands as a powerful method for identifying the transition point that delineates distinct quantum phases. Since each quantum phase exhibits a characteristic sequence of excited states, the crossing of energy levels between low-lying excited states offers a reliable mean to estimate the phase transition point. While approaches like the Variational Quantum Eigensolver are useful for approximating ground states of interacting systems using quantum computing, capturing low-energy excitations remains challenging. In our study, we introduce an equivariant quantum circuit that preserves the total spin and the translational symmetry to accurately describe singlet and triplet excited states in the J1-J2 Heisenberg model on a chain, which are crucial for characterizing its transition point. Additionally, we assess the impact of noise on the variational state, showing that conventional mitigation techniques like Zero Noise Extrapolation reliably restore its physical properties.

TI Quantum simulation for topological Euler insulators
SO COMMUNICATIONS PHYSICS
AB Although recent studies have established a powerful framework to search for and classify topological phases based on symmetry indicators, there exists a large class of fragile topology beyond the description. The Euler class characterizing the topology of two-dimensional real wave functions is an archetypal fragile topology underlying some important properties. However, as a minimum model of fragile topology, the two-dimensional topological Euler insulator consisting of three bands remains a significant challenge to be implemented in experiments. Here, we experimentally realize a three-band Hamiltonian to simulate a topological Euler insulator with a trapped-ion quantum simulator. Through quantum state tomography, we successfully evaluate the Euler class, Wilson loop flow, entanglement spectra and Berry phases to show the topological properties of the Hamiltonian. The flexibility of the trapped-ion quantum simulator further allows us to probe dynamical topological features including skyrmion-antiskyrmion pairs and Hopf links in momentum-time space from quench dynamics.
   A new class of topological systems has been recently discovered, it has been dubbed the Euler insulator and can manifest in two-dimensional systems. The authors present an experimental implementation for realizing the Euler insulator with 171Yb+ ion trapped by an electrode-surface trap where the topological indicators such as the Euler class, Wilson loop flow and entanglement spectrum for the theoretical and experimental models clearly show the presence of a fragile phase

TI Quantum state reconstruction via disentanglement with sequential
   optimization algorithm
SO MACHINE LEARNING-SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB In this work, we report a novel quantum state reconstruction process based on the disentanglement algorithm. We propose a sequential disentanglement scheme, which can transform an unknown quantum state into a product of computational zero states. The inverse evolution of the zero states reconstructs the quantum state up to an overall phase. By sequentially disentangling the qubits one by one, we reduce the required measurements with only individual qubit measurement and identify the transformation unitary efficiently. Variational quantum circuit and reinforcement learning methods are used for the quantum circuit design for continuous and discrete quantum gates implementation. Demonstrations with our proposal for the reconstruction of the random states are presented. Our method is universal and imposes no specific ansatz or constraint on the quantum state.

TI Noisy gates for simulating quantum computers
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB We present a novel method for simulating the noisy behavior of quantum computers, which allows to efficiently incorporate environmental effects in the driven evolution implementing the gates acting on the qubits. We show how to modify the noiseless gate executed by the computer to include any Markovian noise, hence resulting in what we will call a noisy gate. We compare our method with the IBM QISKIT simulator, and show that it follows more closely both the analytical solution of the Lindblad equation as well as the behavior of a real quantum computer, where we ran algorithms involving up to 18 qubits; as such, our protocol offers a more accurate simulator for NISQ devices. The method is flexible enough to potentially describe any noise, including non-Markovian ones. The noise simulator based on this work is available as a PYTHON package at the link, https://pypi.org/project/quantum-gates.

TI Direct Manipulation of Biphoton Generation From the non-Hermitian Nature
   of Light-matter Interaction
SO LASER & PHOTONICS REVIEWS
AB While biphoton generation holds significant importance in quantum entanglement and quantum technology, its dynamics involving non-Hermitian characteristics have experimentally been untouched so far. Nevertheless, it is found that the non-Hermitian features induced by the atomic coherence can be well employed for the direct control of biphoton generation and entanglement. By harnessing such natural non-Hermitian interaction, a method is devised to expand a non-Hermitian Hao biphoton generation processes. It is experimentally demonstrated such biphoton correlation can be adjusted within an unprecedentedly wide range, ranging from Rabi oscillation to antibunching-exponential-decay. Typically, the exceptional point at the transition boundary between the two regimes is distinctly observed.

TI Ultra-low-power second-order nonlinear optics on a chip
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Here, the authors demonstrate a chip-scale device that realizes a comprehensive set of resonant second order nonlinear processes including optical parametric oscillation with a threshold power of 70 microwatts.
   Second-order nonlinear optical processes convert light from one wavelength to another and generate quantum entanglement. Creating chip-scale devices to efficiently control these interactions greatly increases the reach of photonics. Existing silicon-based photonic circuits utilize the third-order optical nonlinearity, but an analogous integrated platform for second-order nonlinear optics remains an outstanding challenge. Here we demonstrate efficient frequency doubling and parametric oscillation with a threshold of tens of micro-watts in an integrated thin-film lithium niobate photonic circuit. We achieve degenerate and non-degenerate operation of the parametric oscillator at room temperature and tune its emission over one terahertz by varying the pump frequency by hundreds of megahertz. Finally, we observe cascaded second-order processes that result in parametric oscillation. These resonant second-order nonlinear circuits will form a crucial part of the emerging nonlinear and quantum photonics platforms.

TI Steered coherence of a central two-qubit system coupled to an XY
   spin chain
SO RESULTS IN PHYSICS
AB We investigate the average steered coherence (ASC) of a central two-qubit system coupled to an XY spin-chain environment. It is shown that there exists subspace in which the initial states are immune to this environment. Outside of this subspace, the decay of the ASC can be significantly suppressed by tuning the interaction of the central qubits and its anisotropy in the z axis, as well as the anisotropy of the spin-spin interaction in the xy plane of the environment and the strength of the transverse magnetic field. For the initial Bell states and their unitary equivalent classes, one can also identify system and environmental parameters for which the ASC oscillates near its maximum even in the long-time interval.

TI Optimal noise estimation from syndrome statistics of quantum codes
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Quantum error correction allows to actively correct errors occurring in a quantum computation when the noise is weak enough. To make this error correction competitive information about the specific noise is required. Traditionally, this information is obtained by benchmarking the device before operation. We address the question of what can be learned from only the measurements done during decoding. Such estimation of noise models was proposed for surface codes, exploiting their special structure, and in the limit of low error rates, also for other codes. However, so far it has been unclear under what general conditions noise models can be estimated from the syndrome measurements. In this work, we derive a general condition for identifiability of the error rates. For general stabilizer codes, we prove identifiability under the assumption that the rates are small enough. Without this assumption, we prove a result for perfect codes. Finally, we propose a practical estimation method with linear runtime for concatenated codes. We demonstrate that it outperforms other recently proposed methods and that the estimation is optimal in the sense that it reaches the Cramer-Rao bound. Our method paves the way for practical calibration of error corrected quantum devices during operation.

TI Beyond unital noise in variational quantum algorithms: noise-induced
   barren plateaus and limit sets
SO QUANTUM
AB hold much promise but face the challenge of exponentially small gradients. Unnomenon leads to an exponential training overhead for VQAs. Perhaps the most pernicious are noise-induced barren plateaus (NIBPs), a type of unavoidable BP arising from open system effects, which have so far been shown to exist for unital noise maps. Here, we generalize the study of NIBPs to more general completely positive, trace-preserving maps, investigating the existence of NIBPs in the unital case and a class of non-unital maps The latter includes amplitude damping. We identify the associated phenomenon of noise-induced limit sets (NILS) of the VQA cost function and prove its existence unital noise maps. Along the way, we extend the parameter shift rule of VQAs to the noisy setting. We provide rigorous bounds in terms of the relevant variables that give rise to NIBPs and NILSs, along with numerical simulations of the depolarlustrate our analytical results.

TI Sharing asymmetric Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen steering with projective
   measurements
SO NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB Recently, both global and local classical randomness-assisted projective measurement protocols have been employed to share Bell nonlocality of an entangled state among multiple sequential parties. Unlike Bell nonlocality, Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR) steering exhibits distinct asymmetric characteristics and serves as the necessary quantum resource for one-sided device-independent quantum information tasks. In this work, we propose a projective measurement protocol and investigate the shareability of EPR steering with steering radius criterion theoretically and experimentally. Our results reveal that arbitrarily many independent parties can share one-way steerability using projective measurements, even when no shared randomness is available. Furthermore, by leveraging only local randomness, asymmetric two-way steerability can also be shared. Our work not only deepens the understanding of the role of projective measurements in sharing quantum correlations but also opens up a new avenue for reutilizing asymmetric quantum correlations.

TI Energy shift and subharmonics induced by nonlinearity in a quantum dot
   system
SO CHINESE PHYSICS B
AB The presence of anticrossings induced by coupling between two states causes curvature in energy levels, yielding a nonlinearity in the quantum system. When the system is driven back and forth along the bending energy levels, subharmonic transitions and energy shifts can be observed, which would cause a significant influence as the system is applied to quantum computing. In this paper, we study a longitudinally driven singlet-triplet (ST) system in a double quantum dot (DQD) system, and illustrate the consequences of nonlinearity by driving the system close to the anticrossings. We provide a straightforward theory to quantitatively describe the energy shift and subharmonics caused by nonlinearity, and find good agreement between our theoretical result and the numerical simulation. Our results reveal the existence of nonlinearity in the vicinity of anticrossings and provide a direct way of analytically assessing its impact, which can be applied to other quantum systems without excessive labor.

TI Optical cavity enhancement experiment of Duan-Lukin-CiracZoller writing
   excitation process in atomic ensemble
SO ACTA PHYSICA SINICA
AB The Duan-Lukin-Cirac-Zoller (DLCZ) process in the atomic ensemble is an important means to generate quantum correlation and entanglement between photons and atoms (quantum interface). When a write pulse acts on atoms, the DLCZ quantum memory process will be generated, which has been extensively studied. In the process a spontaneous Raman scattering (SRS) of a Stokes photon is generated, and a spin-wave excitation stored in the atomic ensemble is created at the same time. The higher probability of the generation of Stokes photons will cause more noise and reduce entanglement. On the contrary, the low generation probability of Stokes photons affects the success probability of entanglement distribution on a quantum repeater. How to increase generation probability of Stokes photons without causing more noise is an urgent problem to be resolved. In this work, a Rb-87 atomic ensemble is placed in a standing wave cavity which resonates with the Stokes photon. This cavity has a trip length of 0.6 m and a free spectral range (FSR) of 256 MHz. The optical loss of all the optical elements in this cavity is 9%, of which 4% loss originates from the other optical elements and 5% loss from the vacuum chamber of the magneto-optical trap (MOT). The fineness of the cavity with the cold atoms is measured to be similar to 19.1. By calculating the total probability of Stokes photon emission out of the cavity, we derive the enhancement factor of this standing wave cavity when the cavity loss is l. When this cavity is locked with PDH frequency locking technique, we observe that the production probability of the Stokes photons is 8.7 times higher than that without cavity due to the optical cavity enhancement effect. Under this condition, the relationship between the generation probability of Stokes photons and the power of write beam is studied. The write excitation probability changes linearly with the power of write beam. This work provides an experimental solution to reducing the noise caused by time multimode operation in DLCZ scheme.

TI Maximally entangled Rydberg-atom pairs via Landau-Zener sweeps
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB We analyze the formation of maximally entangled Rydberg atom pairs subjected to Landau-Zener sweeps of the atom-light detuning. Though the populations reach a steady value at longer times, the phases evolve continuously, leading to periodic oscillations in the entanglement entropy. The local unitary equivalence between the obtained maximally entangled states and the Bell states is verified by computing the polynomial invariants. Finally, we study the effect of spontaneous emission from the Rydberg state of rubidium atoms on the correlation dynamics and show that the oscillatory dynamics persists for high-lying Rydberg states. Our study may offer ways to generate maximally entangled states, quantum gates, and exotic quantum matter in arrays of Rydberg atoms through Landau Zener sweeps.

TI Long-baseline quantum sensor network as dark matter haloscope
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Ultralight dark photons constitute a well-motivated candidate for dark matter. A coherent electromagnetic wave is expected to be induced by dark photons when coupled with Standard-Model photons through kinetic mixing mechanism, and should be spatially correlated within the de Broglie wavelength of dark photons. Here we report the first search for correlated dark-photon signals using a long-baseline network of 15 atomic magnetometers, which are situated in two separated meter-scale shield rooms with a distance of about 1700 km. Both the network's multiple sensors and the shields large size significantly enhance the expected dark-photon electromagnetic signals, and long-baseline measurements confidently reduce many local noise sources. Using this network, we constrain the kinetic mixing coefficient of dark photon dark matter over the mass range 4.1 feV-2.1 peV, which represents the most stringent constraints derived from any terrestrial experiments operating over the aforementioned mass range. Our prospect indicates that future data releases may go beyond the astrophysical constraints from the cosmic microwave background and the plasma heating.
   Nearly a century after dark matter was proposed, yet its nature remains elusive. Here, authors present their dark photon dark matter search results using two atomic magnetometer arrays 1700 km apart in large magnetic shields and offer the strongest terrestrial constraint in this mass range to date.

AB FD-SOI five-gate (5G) qubit MOS devices are electrically characterized in linear regime down to deep cryogenic temperatures. The Lambert-W function is successfully used for the modelling of such 5G MOS devices from subthreshold regime to strong inversion. Its applicability is demonstrated down to 20 K. The 5G device is modeled as a series of five independent transistors: the "active" one, that directly controls the current, and the "external" ones, that act as access resistances. The Lambert-W function enables to accurately determine the inversion charge and the active channel resistance from weak to strong inversion. This approach allows reconstructing the drain current characteristic avoiding the evaluation of the mobility attenuation factors. The main device parameters are extracted versus temperature. Finally, the role of different scattering mechanisms has been investigated, underlying the impact of neutral defects for the gates in proximity of source and drain.

TI Quantum circuit for high order perturbation theory corrections
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB Perturbation theory (PT) might be one of the most powerful and fruitful tools for both physicists and chemists, which has led to a wide variety of applications. Over the past decades, advances in quantum computing provide opportunities for alternatives to classical methods. Recently, a general quantum circuit estimating the low order PT corrections has been proposed. In this article, we revisit the quantum circuits for PT calculations, and develop the methods for higher order PT corrections of eigenenergy, especially the 3rd and 4th order corrections. We present the feasible quantum circuit to estimate each term in these PT corrections. There are two the fundamental operations in the proposed circuit. One approximates the perturbation terms, the other approximates the inverse of unperturbed energy difference. The proposed method can be generalized to higher order PT corrections.

Here, we introduce a frequency-tunable superconducting coplanar waveguide resonator. By applying electrical currents through specifically designed ground wires, we achieve the generation and control of a localized magnetic field on the central line of the resonator, enabling continuous tuning of its resonant frequency. We demonstrate a frequency tuning range of 54.85 MHz in a 6.21-GHz resonator. This integrated and tunable resonator holds great potential as a dynamically tunable filter and as a key component of communication buses and memory elements in superconducting quantum computing.

In this work, we present a systematic study of next-to-leading order electroweak corrections to the angular coefficients characterizing this decay. While these coefficients are highly constrained at leading order, radiative corrections induce shifts of up to 5% to the existing terms and generate novel structures that vanish at leading order, breaking previous relations among coefficients.

AB With the continuous development of power communication network and the improvement of intelligent degree, network security and operation and maintenance become more and more important. Therefore, this paper proposes a solution for intelligent security operation and maintenance of power communication network based on Quantum key distribution (QKD).

TI Robust phase-controlled gates for scalable atomic quantum processors
   using optical standing waves
SO QUANTUM
AB A simple scheme is presented for realizing robust optically controlled quan-tum gates for scalable atomic quantum processors by driving the qubits with optical standing waves. Atoms localized close to the antinodes of the standing wave can realize phase-controlled quantum operations that are potentially more than an order of magnitude less sensitive to the local optical phase and atomic motion than corresponding travelling wave configurations. The scheme is com-patible with robust optimal control techniques and spatial qubit addressing in atomic arrays to realize phase controlled operations without the need for tight focusing and precise positioning of the control lasers. This will be particu-larly beneficial for quantum gates involving Doppler sensitive optical frequency transitions and provides an all optical route to scaling up atomic quantum processors.

TI Many-Body Quantum Magic
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB Magic (nonstabilizerness) is a necessary but "expensive" kind of "fuel" to drive universal fault-tolerant quantum computation. To properly study and characterize the origin of quantum "complexity" in computation as well as physics, it is crucial to develop a rigorous understanding of the quantification of magic. Previous studies of magic mostly focused on small systems and largely relied on the discrete Wigner formalism (which is only well behaved in odd prime power dimensions). Here we present an initiatory study of the magic of genuinely many-body quantum states that may be strongly entangled, with focus on the important case of many qubits, at a quantitative level. We first address the basic question of how "magical" a many-body state can be, and show that the maximum magic of an n-qubit state is essentially n, simultaneously for a range of "good" magic measures. As a corollary, the resource theory of magic has asymptotic golden currency states. We then show that, in fact, almost all n-qubit pure states have magic of nearly n. In the quest for explicit, scalable cases of highly entangled states whose magic can be understood, we connect the magic of hypergraph states with the second-order nonlinearity of their underlying Boolean functions. Next, we go on and investigate many-body magic in practical and physical contexts. We first consider a variant of measurement-based quantum computation where the client is restricted to Pauli measurements, in which magic is a necessary feature of the initial "resource" state. We show that n-qubit states with nearly n magic, or indeed almost all states, cannot supply nontrivial speedups over classical computers. We then present an example of analyzing the magic of "natural" condensed matter systems of physical interest. We apply the Boolean function techniques to derive explicit bounds on the magic of certain representative two-dimensional symmetry-protected topological states, and comment on possible further connections between magic and the quantum complexity of phases of matter.

TI On the detailed structure of quantum control landscape for fast single
   qubit phase-shift gate generation
SO IZVESTIYA MATHEMATICS
AB In this work, we study the detailed structure of quantum control landscape for the problem of single-qubit phase shift gate generation on the fast time scale. In previous works, the absence of traps for this problem was proved on various time scales. A special critical point which was known to exist in quantum control landscapes was shown to be either a saddle or a global extremum, depending on the parameters of the control system. However, in case of a saddle, the numbers of negative and positive eigenvalues of the Hessian at this point and their magnitudes have not been studied. At the same time, these numbers and magnitudes determine the relative ease or difficulty for practical optimization in a vicinity of the critical point. In this work, we compute the numbers of negative and positive eigenvalues of the Hessian at this saddle point and, moreover, give estimates on magnitude of these eigenvalues. We also significantly simplify our previous proof of the theorem about this saddle point of the Hessian (Theorem 3 in [22]).

TI A resource-efficient quantum convolutional neural network
SO FRONTIERS IN PHYSICS
AB Quantum Convolutional Neural Network (QCNN) has achieved significant success in solving various complex problems, such as quantum many-body physics and image recognition. In comparison to the classical Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model, the QCNN model requires excellent numerical performance or efficient computational resources to showcase its potential quantum advantages, particularly in classical data processing tasks. In this paper, we propose a computationally resource-efficient QCNN model referred to as RE-QCNN. Specifically, through a comprehensive analysis of the complexity associated with the forward and backward propagation processes in the quantum convolutional layer, our results demonstrate a significant reduction in computational resources required for this layer compared to the classical CNN model. Furthermore, our model is numerically benchmarked on recognizing images from the MNIST and Fashion-MNIST datasets, achieving high accuracy in these multi-class classification tasks.

TI Quantum Interference in Wilkinson Power Dividers
SO LASER & PHOTONICS REVIEWS
AB Scaling up quantum technologies entails the challenge of developing large-scale and high-performance photonic quantum networks. Engineering novel optical components, with a compact footprint and advanced functionalities, might help addressing this challenge by reducing the size and complexity of optical networks. Here, quantum interference phenomena in Wilkinson power dividers (WPDs), a popular element of microwave networks, is investigated. It is theoretically demonstrated that WPDs grant access to coherent perfect absorption (CPA) quantum state transformations (single photon CPA, coherent absorption of N00N states, two-photon nonlinear absorption, and absorption of coherence in squeezed light) in CPA networks with a smaller footprint and a reduced number of elements. Additionally, it is shown how a WPD can be designed in a pure silicon-on-insulator platform by taking advantage of radiative losses. These findings might represent an important step forward in the development of CPA quantum networks.

TI Logical Bell state measurement for photon system in momentum and
   polarization degrees of freedom
SO SCIENTIA SINICA-PHYSICA MECHANICA & ASTRONOMICA
AB Quantum logic coding efficiently enhances the noise immunity of quantum systems. A quantum logical qubit using multiple degrees of freedom (DOFs) of a photon is concise, and it can reduce resource consumption compared with a quantum logical qubit using multiple photons in one DOF. In this study, two logical Bell state measurement schemes are proposed for photon systems in momentum and polarization DOFs with linear optical elements, namely, momentum polarization logical Bell state measurement assisted by W-state and self-assisted momentum polarization logical Bell state measurement. In the first scheme, parity measurements on momentum and polarization DOFs are performed simultaneously using an auxiliary four-photon W-state. The even-parity logical Bell states can be distinguished by photon detector results, resulting in a success rate of 12.5%. The second scheme does not require an auxiliary entangled photon state, and the even-parity logical Bell states can be completely distinguished by simple linear optical elements and photon detector results with a success rate of 50%. These two linear optical momentum polarization logical Bell state measurement schemes are easier to implement experimentally than the nonlinear optical schemes, and their applications in quantum communication protocols are crucial.

TI The f ⇆ (f)over-tilde Correspondence and Its Applications
   in Quantum Information Geometry
SO ENTROPY
AB Due to the classifying theorems by Petz and Kubo-Ando, we know that there are bijective correspondences between Quantum Fisher Information(s), operator means, and the class of symmetric, normalized operator monotone functions on the positive half line; this last class is usually denoted as F-op. This class of operator monotone function has a significant structure, which is worthy of study; indeed, any step in understanding F-op, besides being interesting per se, immediately translates into a property of the classes of operator means and therefore of Quantum Fisher Information(s). In recent years, the f <-> f correspondence has been introduced, which associates a non-regular element of F-op to any regular element of the same set. In terms of operator means, this amounts to associating a mean with multiplicative character to a mean that has an additive character. In this paper, we survey a number of different settings where this technique has proven useful in Quantum Information Geometry. In Sections 1-4, all the needed background is provided. In Sections 5-14, we describe the main applications of the f <-> (f) over tilde correspondence.

Therefore we extend the previous results of Karimipour et al (2020 Phys. Rev. A 101 032109) to arbitrary dimensional channels and to the classical domain. We demonstrate how application of the proposed scheme can increase on the average the fidelity between a given random pure state and its image transformed by the quantum channel followed by its quasi-inversion.

TI Arbitrary coherent distributions in a programmable quantum walk
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB The coherent superposition of position states in a quantum walk (QW) can be precisely engineered towards the desired distributions to meet the need of quantum information applications. The coherent distribution can make full use of quantum parallel in computation and simulation. Particularly, the uniform superposition provides the robust nonlocality, which has wide applications such as the generation of genuine multibit random numbers without postprocessing. We experimentally demonstrate that the rich dynamics featured with arbitrary coherent distributions can be obtained by introducing different sets of the time-and position-dependent operations. Such a QW is realized by a resource-constant and flexible optical circuit, in which the variable operation is executed based on a Sagnac interferometer in an intrinsically stable and precisely controlled way. Our results contribute to the practical realization of quantum-walk-based quantum computation, quantum simulations, and quantum information protocols.

TI Characterization of multimode linear optical networks
SO ADVANCED PHOTONICS NEXUS
AB Multimode optical interferometers represent the most viable platforms for the successful implementation of several quantum information schemes that take advantage of optical processing. Examples range from quantum communication and sensing, to computation, including optical neural networks, optical reservoir computing, or simulation of complex physical systems. The realization of such routines requires high levels of control and tunability of the parameters that define the operations carried out by the device. This requirement becomes particularly crucial in light of recent technological improvements in integrated photonic technologies, which enable the implementation of progressively larger circuits embedding a considerable amount of tunable parameters. We formulate efficient procedures for the characterization of optical circuits in the presence of imperfections that typically occur in physical experiments, such as unbalanced losses and phase instabilities in the input and output collection stages. The algorithm aims at reconstructing the transfer matrix that represents the optical interferometer without making any strong assumptions about its internal structure and encoding. We show the viability of this approach in an experimentally relevant scenario, defined by a tunable integrated photonic circuit, and we demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of our method. Our findings can find application in a wide range of optical setups, based on both bulk and integrated configurations.

AB The Q-problem is a new lightweight and hard mathematical problem that resists quantum attacks. It depends on putting one known value and two unknown values per equation; whatever the operator, the Q-problem defines certain conditions between equations. This paper presents a new key exchange protocol based on the Q-problem. To protect secure end-to-end communication over a public transmission channel, the proposed mechanism consists of two rounds of exchanging totally random numbers, which ensure a shared secret key between two parties at the end. Security analysis proves the robustness of the proposal and experiments prove its lightness during implementation, making it a promising protocol of hybrid solutions and an assistive technique for the transition to the quantum era.

We use error mitigation and postselection to achieve high-fidelity digital quantum simulations of single-mode and two-mode interactions, as evinced-where possible-by full tomography of the resulting states. We achieve fidelities above 90% in the case of single-mode squeezing with low squeezing values and ranging from 60% to 90% for large squeezing and in the more complex two-mode interactions.

TI Emission of Spin-Correlated Matter-Wave Jets from Spinor Bose-Einstein
   Condensates
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB We report the observation of matter-wave jet emission in a strongly ferromagnetic spinor Bose-Einstein condensate of Li-7 atoms. Directional atomic beams with vertical bar F = 1, m(F) = 1 > and vertical bar F = 1, m(F) = -1 > spin states are generated from vertical bar F = 1, m(F) = 0 > state condensates or vice versa. This results from collective spin-mixing scattering events, where spontaneously produced pairs of atoms with opposite momentum facilitates additional spin-mixing collisions as they pass through the condensates. The matter-wave jets of different spin states (vertical bar F = 1, m(F) = +/- 1 >) can be a macroscopic Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen state with spacelike separation. Its spin-momentum correlations are studied by using the angular correlation function for each spin state. Rotating the spin axis, the inter- and intraspin-momentum correlation peaks display a high-contrast oscillation, indicating collective coherence of the atomic ensembles. We provide numerical calculations that describe the experimental results at a quantitative level. Our Letter paves the way to generating macroscopic quantum entanglement with the spin and motional degree of freedom with massive particles. It has a wide range of applications from quantum information science to the fundamental studies of quantum entanglement.

TI Genuine N-partite entanglement in Schwarzschild-de Sitter black hole
   spacetime
SO EUROPEAN PHYSICAL JOURNAL C
AB Complex quantum information tasks in a gravitational background require multipartite entanglement for effective processing. Therefore, it is necessary to investigate the properties of multipartite entanglement in a relativistic setting. In this paper, we study genuine N-partite entanglement of massless Dirac fields in the Schwarzschild-de Sitter (SdS) spacetime, characterized by the presence of a black hole event horizon (BEH) and a cosmological event horizon (CEH). We obtain the general analytical expression of genuine N-partite entanglement shared by n observers near BEH and m (n+m=N\documentclass[12pt]{minimal} \usepackage{amsmath} \usepackage{wasysym} \usepackage{amsfonts} \usepackage{amssymb} \usepackage{amsbsy} \usepackage{mathrsfs} \usepackage{upgreek} \setlength{\oddsidemargin}{-69pt} \begin{document}$$n+m=N$$\end{document}) observers near CEH. It is shown that genuine N-partite entanglement monotonically decreases with the decrease of the mass of the black hole, suggesting that the Hawking effect of the black hole destroys quantum entanglement. It is interesting to note that genuine N-partite entanglement is a non-monotonic function of the cosmological constant, meaning that the Hawking effect of the expanding universe can enhance quantum entanglement. This result contrasts with multipartite entanglement in single-event horizon spacetime, offering a new perspective on the Hawking effect in multi-event horizon spacetime.

TI Resonant Coupling Parameter Estimation with Superconducting Qubits
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB Today's quantum computers are composed of tens of qubits interacting with each other and the environment in increasingly complex networks. To achieve the best possible performance when operating such systems, it is necessary to have accurate knowledge of all parameters in the quantum computer Hamiltonian. In this paper, we demonstrate theoretically and experimentally a method to efficiently learn the parameters of resonant interactions for quantum computers consisting of frequency-tunable superconducting qubits. Such interactions include, for example, those with other qubits, resonators, two-level systems, or other wanted or unwanted modes. Our method is based on a significantly improved swap spectroscopy calibration and consists of an offline data collection algorithm, followed by an online Bayesian learning algorithm. The purpose of the offline algorithm is to detect and coarsely estimate resonant interactions from a state of zero knowledge. It produces a quadratic speedup in the scaling of the number of measurements. The online algorithm subsequently refines the estimate of the parameters to accuracy comparable with that of traditional swap spectroscopy calibration but in constant time. We perform an experiment implementing our technique with a superconducting qubit. By combining both algorithms, we observe a reduction of the calibration time by 1 order of magnitude. Our method will improve present medium-scale superconducting quantum computers and will also scale up to larger systems. Finally, the two algorithms presented here can be readily adopted by communities working on different physical implementations of quantum computing architectures.

TI SARS-CoV-2 Quantum Sensor Based on Nitrogen-Vacancy Centers in Diamond
SO NANO LETTERS
AB The development of highly sensitive and rapid biosensing tools targeted to the highly contagious virus SARS-CoV-2 is critical to tackling the COVID-19 pandemic. Quantum sensors can play an important role because of their superior sensitivity and fast improvements in recent years. Here we propose a molecular transducer designed for nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in nanodiamonds, translating the presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA into an unambiguous magnetic noise signal that can be optically read out. We evaluate the performance of the hybrid sensor, including its sensitivity and false negative rate, and compare it to widespread diagnostic methods. The proposed method is fast and promises to reach a sensitivity down to a few hundreds of RNA copies with false negative rate less than 1%. The proposed hybrid sensor can be further implemented with different solid-state defects and substrates, generalized to diagnose other RNA viruses, and integrated with CRISPR technology.

TI Hybrid Quantum Systems with Artificial Atoms in Solid State
SO ADVANCED QUANTUM TECHNOLOGIES
AB The development of single-platform qubits, predominant for most of the last few decades, has driven the progress of quantum information technologies but also highlighted the limitations of various platforms. Some inherent issues, such as charge/spin noise in materials hinder certain platforms, while increased decoherence upon attempts to scale up severely impacts qubit quality and coupling on others. In addition, a universal solution for coherent information transfer between quantum systems remains lacking. By combining one or more qubit platforms, one could potentially create new hybrid platforms that might alleviate significant issues that current single-platform qubits suffer from, and in some cases, even facilitate the conversion of static to flying qubits on the same hybrid platform. While nascent, this is an area of rising importance that could shed new light on robust and scalable qubit development and provide new impetus for research directions. Here, the requirements for hybrid systems are defined with artificial atoms in the solid state, exemplified with systems that are proposed or attempted, and conclude with the outlook for such hybrid quantum systems.

TI Rabi and Ramsey oscillations of a Majorana qubit in a quantum
   dot-superconductor array
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
AB The Kitaev chain can be engineered within a quantum dot-superconductor array, hosting Majorana zero modes at fine-tuned sweet spots. In this work, we propose and simulate the occurrence of Rabi and Ramsey oscillations to feasibly construct a minimal Majorana qubit in the quantum dot setup. Our real-time results incorporate realistic effects, e.g., charge noise and leakage, reflecting the latest experimental progress. We demonstrate that Majorana qubits with larger energy gaps exhibit significantly enhanced performance-longer dephasing times, higher quality factors, reduced leakage probabilities, and improved visibilities-compared to those with smaller gaps and with conventional quantum-dot-based charge qubits. We introduce a method for reading out Majorana qubits via quantum capacitance measurements. Our work paves the way for future experiments on realizing Majorana qubits in quantum dot-superconductor arrays.

TI Hierarchical Controlled Joint Remote Implementation of the Partially
   Unknown Operations of m Qudits via m High-Dimensional Entangled States
SO ENTROPY
AB We present a protocol for the hierarchical controlled joint remote implementation of the partially unknown operations of m qudits belonging to some restricted sets by using m multiparticle high-dimensional entangled states as the quantum channel. All the senders share the information of the partially unknown operations and cooperate with each other to implement the partially unknown operations on the remote receiver's quantum system. The receivers are hierarchized in accordance with their abilities to reconstruct the desired state. The agents in the upper grade need only cooperate with one of the lower-grade agents, and the agents in the lower grade need the cooperation of all the other agents. The protocol has the advantage of having high channel capacity by using a high-dimensional entangle state as the quantum channel for the hierarchial controlled joint remote implementation of partially unknown quantum operations of m qudits.

TI Information wells and the emergence of primordial black holes in a
   cyclic quantum universe
SO JOURNAL OF COSMOLOGY AND ASTROPARTICLE PHYSICS
AB Primordial black holes (PBHs) remain one of the most intriguing candidates for dark matter and a unique probe of physics at extreme curvatures. Here, we examine their formation in a bounce cosmology when the post-crunch universe inherits a highly inhomogeneous distribution of imprint entropy from the Quantum Memory Matrix (QMM). Within QMM, every Planck-scale cell stores quantum information about infalling matter; the surviving entropy field S(x) contributes an effective dust component [T-mu nu((QMM))=lambda(del S-mu)(del S-nu)-1/2g(mu nu)(del S)(2) +... that deepens curvature wherever S is large. We show that (i) reasonable bounce temperatures and a QMM coupling lambda similar to O(1) naturally amplify these "information wells" until the density contrast exceeds the critical value delta c similar or equal to 0.3; (ii) the resulting PBH mass spectrum spans 10(-16) M-circle dot-10(3) M-circle dot, matching current microlensing and PTA windows; and (iii) the same mechanism links PBH abundance to earlier QMM explanations of dark matter and the cosmic matter-antimatter imbalance. Observable signatures include a mild blue tilt in small-scale power, characteristic mu-distortions, and an enhanced integrated Sachs-Wolfe signal - all of which will be tested by upcoming CMB, PTA, and lensing surveys.

TI Quantum information measures of the Dirichlet and Neumann hyperspherical
   dots
SO EUROPEAN PHYSICAL JOURNAL PLUS
AB d-dimensional hyperspherical quantum dot with either Dirichlet or Neumann boundary conditions (BCs) allows analytic solution of the Schrodinger equation in position space and the Fourier transform of the corresponding wave function leads to the analytic form of its momentum counterpart too. This paves the way to an efficient computation in either space of Shannon, Renyi and Tsallis entropies, Onicescu energies and Fisher informations; for example, for the latter measure, some particular orbitals exhibit simple expressions in either space at any BC type. A comparative study of the influence of the edge requirement on the quantum information measures proves that the lower threshold of the semi-infinite range of the dimensionless Renyi/Tsallis coefficient where one-parameter momentum entropies exist is equal to d/(d+3) for the Dirichlet hyperball and d/(d+1) for the Neumann one what means that at the unrestricted growth of the dimensionality both measures have their Shannon fellow as the lower verge. Simultaneously, this imposes the restriction on the upper value of the interval [1/2,alpha R) inside which the Renyi uncertainty relation for the sum of the position R rho(alpha) and wave vector R gamma alpha 2 alpha-1 components is defined: alpha R is equal to d/(d-3) for the Dirichlet geometry and to d/(d-1) for the Neumann BC. Some other properties are discussed from mathematical and physical points of view. Parallels are drawn to the corresponding properties of the hydrogen atom and similarities and differences are explained based on the analysis of the associated wave functions.

TI Quantum simulation of indefinite causal order induced quantum
   refrigeration
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB In the classical world, physical events always happen in a fixed causal order. However, it was recently revealed that quantum mechanics allows events to occur with indefinite causal order (ICO). In this study, we use an optical quantum switch to experimentally investigate the application of ICO in thermodynamic tasks. Specifically, we simulate the working system interacting with two identical thermal reservoirs in an ICO, observing the quantum heat extraction even though they are in thermal equilibrium where heat extraction is inaccessible by traditional thermal contact. Using such a process, we simulate an ICO refrigeration cycle and investigate its properties. We also show that by passing through the ICO channel multiple times, one can extract more heat per cycle and thus obtain a higher refrigeration performance. Our results suggest that the causal nonseparability can be a powerful resource for quantum thermodynamic tasks.

TI Simulating Quantum Pauli Noise with Three Independently Controlled Pauli
   Gates
SO ELECTRONICS
AB A quantum Pauli noise is a nonunitary process that alters the state of a qubit by random application of the four Pauli operators. We investigate a four-qubit quantum circuit, consisting of a pipeline of three independently controlled Pauli gates, for simulating the general class of qubit Pauli noises. The circuit with a fixed architecture is controllable by three separable quantum states from three auxiliary qubits in order to adjust the parameters of the targeted Pauli noise on the principal qubit. Important Pauli noises such as bit flip, phase flip, bit phase flip, and depolarizing noise are readily simulated, along with an infinite subset of other Pauli noises. However, the quantum circuit with its simple and fixed architecture cannot simulate all conceivable Pauli noises, and a characterization is proposed, in the parameter space of the Pauli noises, denoting those that are simulable by the circuit and those that are not. The circuit is a useful tool to contribute to controlled simulation, on current or future quantum processors, of nonunitary processes of noise and decoherence.

TI A Post-Quantum Authentication and Key Agreement Scheme for Drone Swarms
SO ELECTRONICS
AB With the continuous development of quantum computing technology, the traditional public key cryptosystem is facing severe security challenges, especially in the resource-constrained UAV swarm communication scenario. To deal with this problem, this paper proposes a secure communication scheme for the post-quantum era, which combines the Kyber-based group key agreement mechanism and the lightweight identity authentication system constructed by sparse Merkle tree (SMT). The system is initialized by the edge node, and supports the dynamic joining and leaving of the UAV through the authentication and key management mechanism. To meet the security and performance requirements in different application scenarios, we design and integrate two mainstream post-quantum signature schemes to provide flexible identity authentication options. Experimental results show that the scheme has low resource overhead while ensuring security, which is suitable for the actual communication deployment of post-quantum UAV swarm.

TI Re-examination of the role of displacement and photon catalysis
   operation in continuous variable measurement device-independent quantum
   key distribution
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB We investigate the benefits of using m-photon catalyzed two-mode squeezed coherent (m-PCTMSC) state in continuous variable measurement device-independent quantum key distribution (CV-MDI-QKD). To that end, we derive the Wigner characteristic function of the m-PCTMSC state and show that the 0-PCTMSC state is a Gaussian state and is an inferior choice as compared to the zero photon catalyzed two-mode squeezed vacuum state for CV-MDI-QKD. We carry out the optimization of the secret key rate with respect to all state parameters, namely variance, transmissivity, and displacement. Contrary to many recent proposals, the results show that zero- and single-photon catalysis operation provides only a marginal benefit in improving the maximum transmission distance. Secondly, we find that displacement offers no benefit in improving CV-MDI-QKD. (c) 2025 Optica Publishing Group under the terms of the Optica Open Access Publishing Agreement

TI Dilute Gd hydroxycarbonate particles for localized spin qubit
   integration
SO MATERIALS HORIZONS
AB Molecular spins are considered as the quantum hardware to build hybrid quantum processors in which coupling to superconducting devices would provide the means to implement the necessary coherent manipulations. As an alternative to large magnetically-dilute crystals or concentrated nano-scale deposits of paramagnetic molecules that have been studied so far, the use of pre-formed sub-micronic spherical particles of a doped Gd@Y hydroxycarbonate is evaluated here. Particles with an adjustable number of spin carriers are prepared through the control of both particle size and doping. Bulk magnetic properties and continuous wave and time-domain-EPR spectroscopy show that the Gd spins in these particles are potential qubits with robust quantum coherence. Monolayers of densely-packed particles are then formed interfacially and transferred successfully to the surface of Nb superconducting resonators. Alternatively, these particles are disposed at controlled localizations as isolated groups of a few particles through Dip-Pen Nanolithography using colloidal organic dispersions as ink. Altogether, this study offers new material and methodologies relevant to the development of viable hybrid quantum processors.
   Sub-micronic Gd@YOHCO3 particles are valid spin qubit carriers with an adjustable number of qubits per particle that can be integrated with nanoscopic control into superconducting devices for the development of viable hybrid quantum processors.

TI An object-oriented implementation of a recursive "quantum network"
   solver and its application to district heating networks
SO ENERGY CONVERSION AND MANAGEMENT-X
AB With the increasing importance of energy efficiency and sustainability, the demand for high-performance district heating networks is also on the rise. As traditional engineering methods were often no longer sufficient, several packages for numerical simulation have evolved. Many of them offer high accuracy at the cost of considerable manual preparation and computational effort. However, there is still no user-friendly software that is equally suitable for simplified studies in the early project phase, for the rapid optimisation of multiple concepts and for subsequent detailed planning and dimensioning. For this reason and in cooperation with some companies from the energy sector, we had conceived a novel, highly flexible modular approach, the so-called "quantum networks", where all parts of the district heating network are appropriately abstracted into quantum elements. Now we present our recent implementation of this model in an object-oriented C++ library. Starting from a generalised base class and making use of the concepts of inheritance and polymorphism, the idea of different levels of detail for the same element type is directly realised and can always be further refined. In addition, as all elements are derived from the same base class, they all share the same outer appearance and can thus be easily combined or interchanged. Based on these prerequisites, a dedicated thermo-hydraulic solver has then been developed. Thanks to its recursive design requiring neither outer iterations nor matrix inversions, it proves to be extremely fast and is therefore suitable for rapid design or optimisation studies in which a vast number of configurations has to be computed. To conclude this part of the work, the developed C++ library was benchmarked on two use cases covering a full year of operation that can now be computed in approximately one second of runtime.

The first is a DQC1 (deterministic quantum computation with one clean qubit) algorithm. The second, for real temperatures, achieves performance comparable to a state-of-the-art DQC1 algorithm [A. N. Chowdhury, R. D. Somma, and Y. Suba,si, Phys. Rev. A 103, 032422 (2021)]. Both our algorithms take as input the Hamiltonian decomposed as a linear combination Pauli operators. We show this decomposition to be DQC1-hard for a given Hamiltonian, providing insight into the hardness of estimating partition functions.

TI Opportunities of Semiconducting Oxide Nanostructures as Advanced
   Luminescent Materials in Photonics
SO ADVANCED MATERIALS
AB The luminescence properties of semiconductors are key to the development of photonics. In recent years, the targeted semiconductor materials have shifted from narrow-bandgap to wide- and ultra-wide-bandgap ones, which means spanning the domains of operation for devices beyond those possible with conventional semiconductors in the fields of high-power devices and deep-ultraviolet photodetectors. Furthermore, materials nanostructures with one or more dimensions at the nanoscale drive additional novelties in their optical properties, boosting innovative features. The next step in advanced materials necessarily goes through the quantum - photonic link, in which electromagnetic waves and electronic quantum states display all possible degrees of freedom. To achieve effective advances in this field, both innovative research in materials science and the development of suitable strategies to assess the quantum signatures in the material systems under study are required. This work reviews the fascinating light emission and confinement in wide and ultra-wide bandgap semiconducting oxides of technological interest in nanostructured form, focusing on their luminescence and the key role they can play in future quantum photonic technologies, such as single photon sources and quantum sensing. Finally, an outlook on future avenues in research is outlined.

AB In this work, the probability uncertainties related to a stationary quantum system with solitonic mass distribution when subjected to deformable hyperbolic potentials are studied. Shannon's entropy and Fisher's information of a position-dependent mass are calculated. To investigate the concept of Shannon and Fisher entropies of the solitonic mass distribution subject to the hyperbolic potential, it is necessary to obtain the analytic solutions at position and momentum space. For the Hamiltonian operator to be Hermitian, we consider the stationary Schrodinger equation ordered by Zhu-Kroemer. This ordering is known to describe abrupt heterojunctions in semiconductor materials. (c) 2022 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI Q-fid: Quantum Circuit Fidelity Improvement with LSTM Networks
SO ADVANCED QUANTUM TECHNOLOGIES
AB The fidelity of quantum circuits (QC) is influenced by several factors, including hardware characteristics, calibration status, and the transpilation process, all of which impact their susceptibility to noise. However, existing methods struggle to estimate and compare the noise performance of different circuit layouts due to fluctuating error rates and the absence of a standardized fidelity metric. In this work, Q-fid is introduced, a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) based fidelity prediction system accompanied by a novel metric designed to quantify the fidelity of quantum circuits. Q-fid provides an intuitive way to predict the noise performance of Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) circuits. This approach frames fidelity prediction as a Time Series Forecasting problem to analyze the tokenized circuits, capturing the causal dependence of the gate sequences and their impact on overall fidelity. Additionally, the model is capable of dynamically adapting to changes in hardware characteristics, ensuring accurate fidelity predictions under varying conditions. Q-fid achieves a high prediction accuracy with an average RMSE of 0.0515, up to 24.7x more accurate than the Qiskit transpile tool mapomatic. By offering a reliable method for fidelity prediction, Q-fid empowers developers to optimize transpilation strategies, leading to more efficient and noise-resilient quantum circuit implementations.

TI Multiple transparency windows in an atom-assisted Laguerre-Gaussian
   rovibrational cavity
SO PHYSICA SCRIPTA
AB An atom-assisted Laguerre-Gaussian rovibrational cavity is proposed to demonstrate the characteristics of the output probe field. The cavity comprises a fixed and moving mirror with a two-level qubit inside it, and the moving mirror can vibrate and rotate simultaneously. The addition of the qubit affects the output probe field properties, and the study explores the impact of various parameters on transparency windows. The article reports a new discovery of triple-transparency windows in a single-cavity system. The study also investigates the slow and fast light propagation in the output probe field and discusses the Stokes and anti-Stokes powers in the proposed cavity system. The findings have implications for the development of future optical devices and quantum communication systems.

TI Tunable infrared high absorbing polarization independent niobium nitride
   plasmonic perfect absorber nanowire photodetectors
SO OPTICAL MATERIALS EXPRESS
AB The recent development of photon-based technologies such as quantum cryptography and quantum computing requires high fidelity and fast photodetectors, as well as the ability to detect single photons. One possibility to achieve these goals are superconducting nanowire single photon detectors, utilizing the superconducting-to-normal conducting phase transition. To achieve the required high efficiency, we use resonant plasmonic perfect absorber effects, reaching over 90% polarization-independent absorbance at our target wavelength of 1140 nm. Moreover, the target wavelength can be easily tuned by adjusting the geometry of our detectors. Furthermore, the high absorbance is maintained at oblique incidence, due to the plasmonic perfect absorber principle, and small active areas can be achieved by the high resonant absorption cross-section of plasmonic resonances. We fabricated different tunable, polarization independent plasmonic perfect absorber superconducting nanowire photodetectors and proved their high absorbance and polarization independent response in the wavelength regime around 1140 nm.

TI Analysis of the Effect of Entanglement Operators and the Scalability of
   Players' Payoff Computation in N-Player Quantum Games
SO ADVANCED QUANTUM TECHNOLOGIES
AB Entanglement is one of the most vital resources in quantum computing. Particularly, in quantum game theory, entanglement holds significant importance since it defines the interactions and the information exchange between two or more players. In this research work, a new set of entanglement operators is introduced for N-player quantum games. This study explores how their application affects each player's behavior throughout the game. Furthermore, the entangling capabilities are tested and evaluated for a wide range of entanglement operator angles, by exploiting the Von Neumann entropy metric, both on a simulator and on a real IBM Quantum system. Their hardware efficiency, against state-of-the-art quantum games entanglement operators, is assessed in terms of circuit depths and fidelity, and showcases their great potential as multiplayer quantum games operators. Finally, three methods are compared for computing the players' payoffs, regarding their scalability and efficiency. This study shows that in all payoff cases, the quantum game results, computed by the quantum hardware, are in accordance with the simulated ones.

TI Optical spin-state polarization in a binuclear europium complex towards
   molecule-based coherent light-spin interfaces
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB The success of the emerging field of solid-state optical quantum information processing (QIP) critically depends on the access to resonant optical materials. Rare-earth ion (REI)-based molecular systems, whose quantum properties could be tuned taking advantage of molecular engineering strategies, are one of the systems actively pursued for the implementation of QIP schemes. Herein, we demonstrate the efficient polarization of ground-state nuclear spins-a fundamental requirement for all-optical spin initialization and addressing-in a binuclear Eu(III) complex, featuring inhomogeneously broadened D-5(0)-> F-7(0) optical transition. At 1.4K, long-lived spectral holes have been burnt in the transition: homogeneous linewidth (Gamma (h)) = 22 1MHz, which translates as optical coherence lifetime (T-2opt) = 14.5 +/- 0.7ns, and ground-state spin population lifetime (T-1spin) = 1.6 +/- 0.4s have been obtained. The results presented in this study could be a progressive step towards the realization of molecule-based coherent light-spin QIP interfaces. Rare-earth ion (REI)-doped systems are well suited for realising coherent light-spin interfaces, but demonstrations of spectral hole burning (SHB) in optical transitions of REI-based systems have been so far limited to REIs dispersed in matrices. Here, the authors report on transient SHB in a binuclear Eu(III) complex.

TI How Much Entanglement Is Needed for Topological Codes and Mixed States
   with Anomalous Symmetry?
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW X
AB It is known that particles with exotic properties can emerge in systems made of simple constituents such as qubits, due to long-range quantum entanglement. In this paper, we provide quantitative characterizations of entanglement necessary for emergent anyons and fermions by using the geometric entanglement measure (GEM), which quantifies the maximal overlap between a given state and any short-rangeentangled states. For systems with emergent anyons, based on the braiding statistics, we show that the GEM scales linearly in the system size regardless of microscopic details. The phenomenon of emergent anyons can also be understood within the framework of quantum error correction (QEC). Specifically, we show that the GEM of any 2D stabilizer codes must be at least quadratic in the code distance. Our proof is based on a generic prescription for constructing string operators, establishing a rigorous and direct connection between emergent anyons and QEC. For systems with emergent fermions, despite that the ground state subspaces could be exponentially huge and their coding properties could be rather poor, we show that the GEM also scales linearly in the system size. Our analysis establishes an intriguing link between quantum anomaly and entanglement: A quantum state respecting anomalous 1-form symmetries must be long-range entangled and have large GEM. Our results also extend to mixed states, such as the ZX-dephased toric code, providing a provably nontrivial class of intrinsically mixed-state phases.

In this study, we present three quantum algorithms for comparing the similarity between two quantum images. These algorithms are applied to binary, grey and color images for the first time. Without considering the image preparation, the proposed algorithms achieve exponential acceleration than the existing quantum and classical methods in all three cases. At the end of this paper, an experiment based on the real quantum computer of IBMQ and simulations verify the effectiveness of the algorithms.

TI Quantum circuit fidelity estimation using machine learning
SO QUANTUM MACHINE INTELLIGENCE
AB The computational power of real-world quantum computers is limited by errors. When using quantum computers to perform algorithms which cannot be efficiently simulated classically, it is important to quantify the accuracy with which the computation has been performed. In this work, we introduce a machine learning-based technique to estimate the fidelity between the state produced by a noisy quantum circuit and the target state corresponding to ideal noise-free computation. Our machine learning model is trained in a supervised manner, using smaller or simpler circuits for which the fidelity can be estimated using other techniques like direct fidelity estimation and quantum state tomography. We demonstrate that, for simulated random quantum circuits with a realistic noise model, the trained model can predict the fidelities of more complicated circuits for which such methods are infeasible. In particular, we show that the trained model may make predictions for circuits with higher degrees of entanglement than were available in the training set and that the model may make predictions for non-Clifford circuits even when the training set included only Clifford-reducible circuits. This empirical demonstration suggests classical machine learning may be useful for making predictions about beyond-classical quantum circuits for some non-trivial problems.

AB We report on an electronic coincidence detection circuit for quantum photonic applications implemented on a field-programmable gate array (FPGA), which records each the time separation between detection events coming from single-photon detectors. We achieve a coincidence window as narrow as 500 ps with a series of optimizations on a readily-available and affordable FPGA development board. Our implementation allows real-time visualization of coincidence measurements for multiple coincidence window widths simultaneously. To demonstrate the advantage of our high-resolution visualization, we certified the generation of polarized entangled photons by collecting data from multiple coincidence windows with minimal accidental counts, obtaining a violation of the Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt (CHSH) Bell inequality by more than 338 standard deviations. Our results have shown the applicability of our electronic design in the field of quantum information.

TI Toward a multi-core ultra-fast optical quantum processor: 43-GHz
   bandwidth real-time amplitude measurement of 5-dB squeezed light using
   modularized optical parametric amplifier with 5G technology
SO APPLIED PHYSICS LETTERS
AB Continuous-variable optical quantum information processing, where quantum information is encoded in a traveling wave of light called a flying qubit, is a candidate for a practical quantum computer with high clock frequencies. Homodyne detectors for quadrature-phase amplitude measurements have been the major factor limiting the clock frequency. Here, we developed a real-time amplitude measurement method using a modular optical parametric amplifier (OPA) and a broadband balanced photodiode that is commercially used for coherent wavelength-division multiplexing telecommunication of the fifth-generation mobile communication systems (5G). The OPA amplifies one quadrature-phase component of the quantum-level signal to a loss-tolerant macroscopic level and suppresses the loss after the OPA from 92.4% to only 0.4%. This method was applied to a broadband squeezed vacuum measurement with a center wavelength of 1545.32 nm. In the time-domain measurement, the squeezing level of 5.1 +/- 0.1 dB without loss correction was obtained by a real-time oscilloscope with a sampling rate of 160 GHz and an analog bandwidth of 63 GHz. The frequency-domain analysis also shows that a squeezing level of 5.2 +/- 0.5 dB is obtained from DC to 43 GHz, which is limited by the balanced detector. This indicates that the proposed method can be easily broadened by using a broader bandwidth measurement instrument. By applying this method, not only can optical quantum computers with high clock frequencies be realized but also multi-core systems can be realized.(c) 2023 Author(s).

TI QuTiP 5: The Quantum Toolbox in Python
SO PHYSICS REPORTS-REVIEW SECTION OF PHYSICS LETTERS
AB QuTiP, the Quantum Toolbox in Python (Johansson et al., 2012, Johansson et al., 2013), has been at the forefront of open-source quantum software for the past 13 years. It is used as a research, teaching, and industrial tool, and has been downloaded millions of times by users around the world. Here we introduce the latest developments in QuTiP v5, which are set to have a large impact on the future of QuTiP and enable it to be a modern, continuously developed and popular tool for another decade and more. We summarize the code design and fundamental data layer changes as well as efficiency improvements, new solvers, applications to quantum circuits with QuTiP-QIP, and new quantum control tools with QuTiP-QOC. Additional flexibility in the data layer underlying all "quantum objects" in QuTiP allows us to harness the power of state-of-the-art data formats and packages like JAX, CuPy, and more. We explain these new features with a series of both well-known and new examples. The code for these examples is available in a static form on GitHub (https://github.com/qutip/qutip-paper-v5-examples) and as continuously updated and documented notebooks in the qutip-tutorials package (https://github.com/qutip/qutip-tutorials).

TI Low-complexity continuous-variable quantum key distribution with true
   local oscillator using pilot-assisted frequency locking
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB In the domain of continuous variable quantum key distribution (CV-QKD), a significant challenge arises in achieving precise frequency synchronization, an issue commonly termed as frequency locking. This involves matching the optical frequencies of both the quantum signal laser and the local oscillator laser for accurate symbol demodulation during the exchange of quantum keys. As such, implementations today still grapple with maintaining precise synchronization between sender and receiver frequencies, occasionally hindering the efficiency and reliability of the information exchange. Addressing this challenge, we present and empirically validate a novel approach to CV-QKD by incorporating a pilot tone-assisted frequency locking algorithm to enhance stability when using a locally generated local oscillator (LLO) at the receiver. The proposed design leverages software-based optimization techniques, thereby eliminating the need for high-speed electronic stabilization devices and achieving efficient performance at typical repetition rates. Specifically, the introduction of the pilot tone algorithm allows us to effectively mitigate phase fluctuations and preserve the integrity of the quantum signals during transmission without resorting to time-multiplexed reference pulses or fast-locking electronics in the lasers. Our results suggest the potential for achieving secure key rates of up to 1 Mb/s over a 50 km single-mode fiber when using these techniques, offering promising insights into the feasibility of high-rate, low-complexity CV-QKD implementations under realistic conditions.

TI Adaptive Feedback Compensation Algorithm for Quantum Random Number
   Generators
SO ENTROPY
AB As a core component in quantum cryptography, Quantum Random Number Generators (QRNGs) face dual critical challenges: insufficient randomness enhancement and limited compatibility with post-processing algorithms. This study proposes an Adaptive Feedback Compensation Algorithm (AFCA) to address these limitations through dynamic parameter feedback and selective encryption strategies. The AFCA dynamically adjusts nonlinear transformation intensity based on real-time statistical deviations, retaining over 50% of original bits while correcting local imbalances. Experimental results demonstrate significant improvements across QRNG types: the Monobit Test p-value for continuous QRNGs increased from 0.1376 to 0.9743, and the 0/1 distribution deviation in discrete QRNGs decreased from 7.9% to 0.5%. Compared to traditional methods like von Neumann correction, AFCA reduces data discard rates by over 55% without compromising processing efficiency. These advancements provide a robust solution for high-security quantum communication systems requiring multi-layered encryption architectures.

Modern cryptography is based on the computational complexity of specific mathematical problems; however, as new quantum-based computers are developed, classical methods might not be sufficient to secure communications. In this paper, we analyze the state of the Galileo open service navigation message authentication (OSNMA) to overcome these new threats. This analysis and its assessment have been performed using OSNMA documentation, where we have reviewed the available post-quantum cryptography (PQC) algorithms competing in the National Institute of Standards and Technology standardization process and assessed the possibility of OSNMA implementation in the Galileo service. The main barrier to adopting PQC approaches is the size of both the signature and the key. This analysis shows that OSNMA is not yet capable of facing quantum threats and that significant changes are required. This work concludes by assessing different transitory countermeasures that can be implemented to sustain the system's integrity in the short term.

TI Batch Optimization of Frequency-Modulated Pulses for Robust Two-Qubit
   Gates in Ion Chains
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW APPLIED
AB Two-qubit gates in trapped-ion quantum computers are generated by applying spin-dependent forces that temporarily entangle the internal state of the ion with its motion. Laser pulses are carefully designed to generate a maximally entangling gate between the ions while minimizing any residual entanglement between the motion and the ion. The quality of the gates suffers when the actual experimental parameters differ from the ideal case. Here, we improve the robustness of frequency-modulated Molmer-Sorensen gates to motional mode-frequency offsets by optimizing the average performance over a range of systematic errors using batch optimization. We then compare this method with frequency-modulated gates optimized for ideal parameters that include an analytic robustness condition. Numerical simulations show good performance up to 12 ions, and the method is experimentally demonstrated on a two-ion chain.

TI Simulating and studying the topological properties of the photon-phonon
   coupled modes in a one-dimensional superconducting circuit lattice
SO RESULTS IN PHYSICS
AB We theoretically study the topological properties in a one-dimensional superconducting circuit lattice, where each unit cell is composed of a superconducting microwave cavity, a nanomechanical resonator (NAMR) and a superconducting qubit. By using diagonalization and dimensional reduction methods, the quantum spin Hall system of the photon-phonon coupled modes can be achieved. We analyze the energy spectrum and edge states of different lattice sizes. It is found that the number of lattices affects the topological characteristics of the system, and the inversion of the edge state distribution can be realized. In addition, considering the effects of defects, dissipation and disorder on the system, we find that they will respectively expand the region of the edge state, change the maximum value of the energy spectrum and cause small fluctuation of the energy spectrum. But the edge state is still very stable, which is due to the topological protection of the edge state. This scheme opens up a new way to study the application of topological matter in quantum information processing, meanwhile, the research results can be used to design novel quantum devices.

TI Generation of Werner-like states via a two-qubit system plunged in a
   thermal reservoir and their application in solving binary classification
   problems
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB We present a theoretical scheme for the generation of stationary entangled states. To achieve the purpose we consider an open quantum system consisting of a two-qubit plunged in a thermal bath, as the source of dissipation, and then analytically solve the corresponding quantum master equation. We generate two classes of stationary entangled states including the Werner-like and maximally entangled mixed states. In this regard, since the solution of the system depends on its initial state, we can manipulate it and construct robust Bell-like state. In the continuation, we analytically obtain the population and coherence of the considered two-qubit system and show that the residual coherence can be maintained even in the equilibrium condition. Finally, we successfully encode our two-qubit system to solve a binary classification problem. We demonstrate that, the introduced classifiers present high accuracy without requiring any iterative method. In addition, we show that the quantum based classifiers beat the classical ones.

TI Beyond Wave-Nature Signatures: h-Independent Transport in
   Strongly-Scattering Quasi-2D Quantum Channels
SO CONDENSED MATTER
AB The Landauer-B & uuml;ttiker formalism provides a fundamental framework for mesoscopic transport, typically expressing conductance in units of the quantum of conductance, e2/h. Here, we present a theoretical study of electron transport in a quasi two-dimensional (2D) quantum wire. This system features a wide transverse confinement and a longitudinal, high-energy, narrow potential barrier. The derivation, performed within the Landauer framework, yields an analytical expression for the total conductance that is explicitly independent of Planck's constant (h). Instead, the conductance is found to depend solely on the Fermi energy, the electron effective mass, the wire width, and the effective barrier strength. We interpret this as an emergent phenomenon where the explicit signature of the electron's wave-like nature, commonly manifest through Planck's constant (h) in the overall scaling of conductance, is effectively absorbed within the energy- and geometry-dependent sum of transmission probabilities. This allows the conductance to be primarily governed by the Fermi energy, representing a 'state-counting' quantum parameter rather than more wave-like characteristic.

TI A Cryo-CMOS Wideband Quadrature Receiver With Frequency Synthesizer for
   Scalable Multiplexed Readout of Silicon Spin Qubits
SO IEEE JOURNAL OF SOLID-STATE CIRCUITS
AB In this article, a cryo-CMOS receiver integrated with a frequency synthesizer for scalable multiplexed readout of qubits is presented, focusing on radio frequency (RF) reflectometry readout of silicon-based semiconductor spin qubits/quantum dots. The proposed spin qubit readout chip consists of a wideband low noise amplifier (LNA), a quadrature mixer, a complex filter, a pair of in-phase/quadrature (I/Q) intermediate frequency (IF) amplifier chains, and a type-II charge-pump phase-locked loop (PLL) with a programmable frequency divider providing local oscillator (LO) signals. Noise optimizations are applied to the LNA design and the quadrature active mixer design to obtain the required performance. A mode-switching complementary voltage-controlled oscillator (VCO) is proposed to achieve low-power and low-phase noise in a wide-frequency tuning range (46.5%). Circuit modifications and design considerations for robust cryogenic temperature operation are presented and discussed. Measurements show that the receiver provides an average gain of 65 dB, a minimum noise figure of 0.5 dB, an IF bandwidth of 0.1-1.5 GHz, and an image rejection ratio of 23 dB at 3.5 K with a power consumption of 108 mW. This cryo-CMOS receiver with frequency synthesizer for spin qubit readout is a first step toward fully-integrated qubit readout and control.

TI Enhancing computational accuracy with parallel parameter optimization in
   variational quantum eigensolver
SO AIP ADVANCES
AB Variational quantum algorithms have promising applications in noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices. These algorithms rely on a classical optimization outer loop that minimizes a parameterized quantum circuit function. The optimization in variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) is NP-hard, meaning that finding the optimal solution is infeasible in the worst-case scenario. One way to address this challenge is through parallel optimization of parameters using multiple-parameterized quantum circuits. However, this approach is unsuitable for cloud-based quantum processing unit utilization due to the increased number of quantum circuit executions. Although NISQ devices have limitations in terms of gate depth, their size has been growing in recent years. Therefore, implementing multiple-parameterized quantum circuits in NISQ devices can suppress the increase in the number of executions. In this study, we propose a parallel-VQE, which leverages the parallel execution of parameterized quantum circuits to perform parallel parameter optimization in VQE, achieving convergence to solutions closer to the ground state. We validate the effectiveness of parallel-VQE in solving the random weighted max-cut problem using numerical simulations and a real quantum device. We present the results of running up to six circuits in parallel (120 qubits) and demonstrate the advantages of using multiple units to improve computational accuracy. This study provides a potential method for solving eigenvalue problems and combinatorial optimization problems for future quantum devices. (c) 2025 Author(s).

TI Toward Optimal Quantum Ranging: Hypothesis Testing for an Unknown Return
   Signal
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW APPLIED
AB Quantum information theory sets the ultimate limits for any information-processing task. In rangefinding and LIDAR, the presence or absence of a target can be tested by detecting different states at the receiver. In this Paper, we use quantum hypothesis testing for an unknown coherent-state return signal in order to derive the limits of symmetric and asymmetric error probabilities of single-shot ranging experiments. We engineer a single measurement independent of the range, which in some cases saturates the quantum bound and for others is presumably the best measurement to approach it. This work bridges the gap between quantum information and quantum sensing and engineering and will contribute to devising better ranging sensors, as well as setting the path for finding practical limits for other quantum tasks.

TI Investigation of channel material purity in fully depleted
   silicon-on-insulator transistors designed for qubit applications
SO APPLIED PHYSICS LETTERS
AB Silicon holds significant potential as a material for future quantum processors. Transistors built in silicon-on-insulator technology and functioning as silicon qubit devices can be fabricated using industry-standard processes, allowing for easy integration with classical control hardware. However, achieving precise management of carrier transfer within the transistor channel is essential, requiring the elimination of electrically active defects that could act as recombination centers. Optimizing such a device demands a detailed characterization of the channel to assess the material purity. This study examines the presence of defects in the channel of fully depleted silicon-on-insulator transistors designed for qubit applications. Source and drain electrodes were connected together and voltage pulses were applied to the gate contact to perform capacitance deep level transient spectroscopy (DLTS) measurements. Electrical simulations conducted using Sentaurus device simulator were used to figure out the extension of the depleted region in the channel. By adjusting the gate voltages, we were able to probe the channel and localize the electrically active defects responsible for DLTS signals. Three dominant hole traps were detected at, respectively, 0.54, 0.57, and 0.65 eV above the valence band edge in the source/drain regions and were associated with bulk and Si/SiO2 interface defects. Their origin is likely related to the damage produced during the formation of p-doping by implantation. This study highlights not only the high quality of the channel material below the gate stack but also the need to keep the source and drain regions far from the gate edges to improve the qubit stability.

AB Hybrid photonic devices, harnessing the advantages of multiple materials while mitigating their respective weaknesses, represent a promising solution to the effective on -chip integration of generation and manipulation of non-classical states of light encoding quantum information. We demonstrate a hybrid III-V/Silicon quantum photonic device combining the strong second-order nonlinearity and compliance with electrical pumping of the III-V semiconductor platform with the high maturity and CMOS compatibility of the silicon photonic platform. Our device embeds the spontaneous parametric down -conversion (SPDC) of photon pairs into an Al-GaAs source and their subsequent routing to a silicon -on -insulator circuitry. This enables the on -chip generation of broadband telecom photon pairs by type 0 and type 2 SPDC from the hybrid device, at room temperature and with strong rejection of the pump beam. Two -photon interference with 92% visibility proves the high energy -time entanglement quality characterizing the produced quantum state, thereby enabling a wide range of quantum information applications..

TI Quantum Blockchain Based on Dimensional Lifting Generalized Gram-Schmidt
   Procedure
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB The advancement of quantum computers undermines the security of classical blockchain, necessitating either a post-quantum upgrade of the existing architecture or creation of an inherently quantum blockchain. Here we propose a practically realizable model of a fully quantum blockchain based on a generalized Gram-Schmidt procedure utilizing dimensional lifting. In this model, information of transactions stored in a multi-qubit state are subsequently encoded using the generalized Gram-Schmidt process. The chain is generated as a result of the reliance of orthogonalized state on the sequence of states preceding it. Various forking scenarios and their countermeasures are considered for the proposed model. It is shown to be secure even against quantum computing attacks using the no-cloning theorem and non-democratic nature of Generalized Gram-Schmidt orthogonalization. Finally, we outline a framework for a quantum token built on the same architecture as our blockchain.

TI Real-space Bell inequalities in de Sitter
SO JOURNAL OF COSMOLOGY AND ASTROPARTICLE PHYSICS
AB Bell-inequality violations reveal the presence of quantum correlations between two particles that have interacted and then separated. Their generalisation to quantum fields is necessary to study a number of field-theoretic setups, such as cosmological density fluctuations. In this work, we show how Bell operators can be constructed for quantum fields in real space, and for Gaussian states we compute their expectation value in terms of the field power spectra. We then apply our formalism to a scalar field in de-Sitter space-time. We find that, in spite of the tremendous production of entangled particles with opposite wave momenta on large scales, Bell inequalities are not violated in real space. The reason is that, when considering measurements of a field at two distinct locations in real space, one implicitly traces over the configuration of the field at every other location, leading to a mixed bipartite system. This "effective decoherence" effect is responsible for the erasure of quantum features, and casts some doubts on our ability to reveal the quantum origin of cosmological structures. We finally discuss these results in the light of quantum discord.

TI Using Molecular Design to Enhance the Coherence Time of Quintet
   Multiexcitons Generated by Singlet Fission in Single Crystals
SO JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN CHEMICAL SOCIETY
AB Multiexciton quintet states, (5)(TT), photogenerated in organic semiconductors using singlet fission (SF), consist of four quantum entangled spins, promising to enable new applications in quantum information science. However, the factors that determine the spin coherence of these states remain underexplored. Here, we engineer the packing of tetracene molecules within single crystals of 5,12-bis(tricyclohexylsilylethynyl)tetracene (TCHS-tetracene) to demonstrate a (5)(TT) state that exhibits promising spin qubit properties, including a coherence time, T-2, = 3 mu s at 10 K, a population lifetime, T-pop, = 130 mu s at 5 K, and stability even at room temperature. The single-crystal platform also enables global alignment of the spins and, consequently, individual addressability of the spin- sublevel transitions. Decoherence mechanisms, including exciton diffusion, electronic dipolar coupling, and nuclear hyperfine interactions, are elucidated, providing design principles for increasing T-2 and the operational temperature of (5)(TT). By dynamically decoupling (5)(TT) from the surrounding spin bath, T-2 = 10 mu s is achieved. These results demonstrate the viability of harnessing singlet fission to initiate multiple electron spins in a well-defined quantum state for next-generation molecular-based quantum technologies.

TI Observation of Feshbach resonances between a single ion and ultracold
   atoms
SO NATURE
AB The control of physical systems and their dynamics on the level of individual quanta underpins both fundamental science and quantum technologies. Trapped atomic and molecular systems, neutral(1) and charged(2), are at the forefront of quantum science. Their extraordinary level of control is evidenced by numerous applications in quantum information processing(3,4) and quantum metrology(5,6). Studies of the long-range interactions between these systems when combined in a hybrid atom-ion trap(7,8) have led to landmark results(9-19). However, reaching the ultracold regime-where quantum mechanics dominates the interaction, for example, giving access to controllable scattering resonances(20,21)-has so far been elusive. Here we demonstrate Feshbach resonances between ions and atoms, using magnetically tunable interactions between Ba-138(+) ions and Li-6 atoms. We tune the experimental parameters to probe different interaction processes-first, enhancing three-body reactions(22,23) and the related losses to identify the resonances and then making two-body interactions dominant to investigate the ion's sympathetic cooling(19) in the ultracold atomic bath. Our results provide deeper insights into atom-ion interactions, giving access to complex many-body systems(24-27) and applications in experimental quantum simulation(28-30).

TI Loss-tolerant quantum multi-party key agreement without quantum storage
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB Quantum key distribution (QKD) and quantum key agreement (QKA) are two main branches of key establishment in quantum cryptography. However, the research of QKA falls far behind that of QKD, especially in practicability. The main reason is that QKA needs to resist not only the outside eavesdropping but also the participant cheating. Resisting dishonest participant is more difficult than resisting outside eavesdropping, especially when the apparatuses are imperfect. Actually, existing QKA protocols cannot tolerate the channel loss and have to rely on stable quantum storage. To solve this problem, we give a new quantum multi-party key agreement protocol based on the error-correcting code. Our protocol is loss tolerant, and the participants can measure the received qubits immediately in one of two conjugate bases, without storage, so our protocol can eliminate the requirement of quantum storage. Besides, our protocol is more fair because it can partially discriminate dishonest participants' cheating from outside eavesdropping (previously, these two attacks are generally checked simultaneously via decoy states but cannot be discriminated), as a result, dishonest participants generally will not cheat at the cost of losing good reputation.(c) 2022 Optica Publishing Group under the terms of the Optica Open Access Publishing Agreement

TI Integration of quantum key distribution and high-throughput classical
   communications in field-deployed multi-core fibers
SO LIGHT-SCIENCE & APPLICATIONS
AB Quantum key distribution (QKD) is a secure communication method for sharing symmetric cryptographic keys based on the principles of quantum physics. Its integration into the fiber-optic network infrastructure is important for ensuring privacy in optical communications. Multi-core fibers (MCFs), the likely building blocks of future high-capacity optical networks, offer new opportunities for such integration. Here, we experimentally demonstrate, for the first time, the coexistence of discrete-variable QKD and high-throughput classical communication in the C-band over a field-deployed MCF with industry standard cladding diameter of 125 mu m. Specifically, we demonstrate successful secure-key establishment in one core of a 25.2-km uncoupled-core MCF, while simultaneously loading the remaining three cores with full C-band counter-propagating classical traffic at an aggregate net rate of 110.8 Tb/s. By proposing and experimentally validating an improved analytical model for inter-core spontaneous Raman scattering noise, we find that this configuration is optimal for our deployed MCF link as it is immune to four-wave mixing, that becomes relevant when the quantum and classical signals are propagating in the same direction. Our findings make an important step forward in demonstrating the integration of QKD and classical transmission in uncoupled-core multi-core fibers for next-generation optical communication networks.

TI Engineering spin coherence in core-shell diamond nanocrystals
SO PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF
   AMERICA
AB Fluorescent diamond nanocrystals can host spin qubit sensors capable of probing the physical properties of biological systems with nanoscale spatial resolution. Sub-100 nm diamond nanosensors can readily be delivered into intact cells and even living organisms. However, applications beyond current proof-of-principle experiments require a substantial increase in sensitivity, which is limited by surface induced charge instability and electron-spin dephasing. In this work, we utilize engineered core-shell structures to achieve a drastic increase in qubit coherence times (T2) from 1.1 to 35 mu s in bare nanodiamonds to upward of 52 to 87 mu s. We use electron-paramagnetic-resonance results to present a band bending model and connect silica encapsulation to the removal of deleterious mid-gap surface states that are negatively affecting the qubit's spin properties. Combined with a 1.9-fold increase in particle luminescence these advances correspond to up to two-order-of-magnitude reduction in integration time. Probing qubit dynamics at a single particle level further reveals that the noise characteristics fundamentally change from a bath with spins that rearrange their spatial configuration during the course of an experiment to a more dilute static bath. The observed results shed light on the underlying mechanisms governing fluorescence and spin properties in diamond nanocrystals and offer an effective noise mitigation strategy based on engineered core-shell structures.

TI Depth Optimization of FLT-Based Quantum Inversion Circuit
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB Works on quantum computing and cryptanalysis have increased significantly in the past few years. Various constructions of quantum arithmetic circuits as one of the primary elements in the field have also been proposed. However, there have only been a few studies on finite field inversion despite its essential use in realizing quantum algorithms, such as in Shor's algorithm for Elliptic Curve Discrete Logarithm Problem (ECDLP). In this study, we propose to reduce the depth of the existing quantum Fermat's Little Theorem (FLT)-based inversion circuit for the binary finite field. In particular, we propose to follow a complete waterfall approach to translate the Itoh-Tsujii's variant of FLT to the corresponding quantum circuit and remove the inverse squaring operations employed in the previous work by Banegas et al., lowering the number of CNOT gates (i.e., CNOT count) as well as slightly reducing the T depth, which contributes to a reduced overall depth and gate count. Furthermore, we concretely verify our method and compare it with the previous work in Qiskit, a quantum computer simulation environment, by constructing both our method and the previous work from scratch and performing the resource analysis. Additionally, we propose employing the relative-phase Toffoli gate by Gidney as opposed to the standard Toffoli implementation, which yields a significantly lower T depth while further reducing the overall depth. Our approach can serve as an alternative for a time-efficient implementation.

TI Countermeasure for security loophole caused by asymmetric correlations
   of reference frame independent quantum key distribution with fewer
   quantum states
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB One of the challenging issues in free-space quantum key distribution (QKD) is the requirement of active compensation of the reference frame between the transmitter and receiver. Reference frame independent (RFI) QKD removes active compensation, but it requires more quantum states. A recent proposal can effectively reduce the required quantum states, but this can be achieved assuming the correlations defined in RFI QKD are symmetric. In a real QKD system, such symmetric correlations cannot always be satisfied owing to the device imperfections and optical misalignment. We theoretically analyze the effect of asymmetric correlations. Consequently, we report that the asymmetry causes security loopholes and provide a countermeasure to prevent them. Furthermore, we provide the experimental results of a free-space RFI QKD system to verify the countermeasure for the aforementioned problem. In conclusion, our work provides feasibility of the practical RFI QKD system with fewer quantum states by effectively preventing the security loophole.

TI On the control of flying qubits
SO AUTOMATICA
AB The control of flying quantum bits (qubits) carried by traveling quantum fields is crucial for coherent information transmission in quantum networks. In this paper, we develop a general framework for modeling the control of flying qubits based on the quantum stochastic differential equation (QSDE) that describes the input-output process actuated by a standing quantum system. Under the continuous time-ordered photon-number basis, the infinite-dimensional QSDE is reduced to a low-dimensional deterministic differential equation for the non-unitary state evolution of the standing quantum system, and the outgoing flying-qubit states can be expressed in the form of randomly occurring quantum jumps. This makes it possible, as demonstrated by examples of flying-qubit generation and transformation, to analyze general cases when the number of excitations is not reserved. The proposed framework lays the foundation for the design of flying-qubit control systems, with which advanced control techniques can be incorporated for practical applications.

TI Post-Quantum Blockchain-Based Secure Service Orchestration in
   Multi-Cloud Networks
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB Existing network service provisioning and lifecycle management (LCM) workflows rely on heterogeneous devices from multiple vendors and collaboration between multiple network actors, which can lead to numerous trust management and interoperability issues. Blockchain networks (BCNs) are a revolutionary way to establish trust in untrusted environments. In this complex environment, BCNs can help ensure transparency and security for network service LCM. However, BCNs are also vulnerable to quantum attacks. Advances in quantum computing will challenge the security of existing blockchain technology based on Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) technologies. In this paper, we explore how network services can be managed in a multiple administrative scenario. Our approach uses BCNs to track the operational steps of network service instantiation metrics while benefiting from the security features of post-quantum cryptography (PQC). Together with the use of N-th degree Truncated polynomial Ring Units (NTRU) as an example of a PQC algorithm that relies on the parallelization power of the Toom-Cook computation method with different security levels, we have shown that Quorum can provide a lower average time-to-write value compared to other BCNs considered (Ethereum and Hyperledger). At the end of the paper, we discuss the evaluation results and future directions regarding the coexistence of PQC algorithms and BCNs for network service orchestration and service federation between multiple administrative domains.

TI Cryogenic quantum computer control signal generation using
   high-electron-mobility transistors
SO COMMUNICATIONS ENGINEERING
AB Multiplexed local charge storage, close to quantum processors at cryogenic temperatures could generate a multitude of control signals, for electronics or qubits, in an efficient manner. Such cryogenic electronics require generating quasi-static control signals with small area footprint, low noise, high stability, low power dissipation and, ideally, in a multiplexed fashion to reduce the number of input/outputs. In this work, we integrate capacitors with cryogenic high-electron mobility transistor (HEMT) arrays and demonstrate quasi-static bias generation using gate pulses controlled in time and frequency domains. Multi-channel bias generation is also demonstrated. Operation at 4 K exhibits improved bias signal variability and greatly reduced subthreshold swing, reaching values of similar to 6 mV/decade. Due to the very low threshold voltage of 80 mV at 4 K and the steep subthreshold swing, these circuits can provide an advantage over the silicon-based complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor equivalents by allowing operation at significantly reduced drive bias in the low output voltage regime <1 V. Together with their high-speed operation, this makes HEMTs an attractive platform for future cryogenic signal generation electronics in quantum computers.

TI Control landscapes for high-fidelity generation of C-NOT and C-PHASE
   gates with coherent and environmental driving
SO EUROPEAN PHYSICAL JOURNAL PLUS
AB High-fidelity generation of two-qubit gates is important for quantum computation, since such gates are components of popular universal sets of gates. Here, we consider the problem of high-fidelity generation of two-qubit C-NOT and C-PHASE (with a detailed study of C-Z) gates in presence of the environment. We consider the general situation when qubits are manipulated by coherent and incoherent controls; the latter is used to induce generally time-dependent decoherence rates. For estimating efficiency of optimization methods for high-fidelity generation of these gates, we study quantum control landscapes which describe the behavior of the fidelity as a function of the controls. For this, we generate and analyze the statistical distributions of best objective values obtained by incoherent GRadient Ascent Pulse Engineering (inGRAPE) approach. We also apply inGRAPE and a dual annealing algorithm (DAA) based on a stochastic zeroth-order method to numerically estimate minimal infidelity values. The results are different from the case of single-qubit gates and indicate a smooth trap-free behavior of the fidelity.

TI Impact of Unreliable Devices on Stability of Quantum Computations
SO ACM TRANSACTIONS ON QUANTUM COMPUTING
AB Noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices are valuable platforms for testing the tenets of quantum computing, but these devices are susceptible to errors arising from de-coherence, leakage, cross-talk, and other sources of noise. This raises concerns regarding the stability of results when using NISQ devices since strategies for mitigating errors generally require well-characterized and stationary error models. Here, we quantify the reliability of NISQ devices by assessing the necessary conditions for generating stable results within a given tolerance. We use similarity metrics derived from device characterization data to derive and validate bounds on the stability of a 5-qubit implementation of the Bernstein-Vazirani algorithm. Simulation experiments conducted with noise data from IBM washington, spanning January 2022 to April 2023, revealed that the reliability metric fluctuated between 41% and 92%. This variation significantly surpasses the maximum allowable threshold of 2.2% needed for stable outcomes. Consequently, the device proved unreliable for consistently reproducing the statistical mean in the context of the Bernstein-Vazirani circuit.

TI Release of virtual photon and phonon pairs from qubit-plasmon-phonon
   ultrastrong coupling system
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB The most important difference between ultrastrong and non-ultrastrong coupling regimes is that the ground state contains excitations. We consider a qubit-plasmon-phonon ultrastrong coupling (USC) system with a three-level atom coupled to the photon and phonon via its upper two energy levels and show that spontaneous emission of the atom from its intermediate to its ground state produces photon and phonon pairs. It is shown that the current system can produce a strong photon/phonon stream and the atom-phonon coupling plays the active role, which ensures the experimental detection. The emission spectrum and various high-order correlation functions confirm the generation of the pairs of photons and phonons. Our study has important implications for future research on virtual photon and phonon pairs creation in the ground state of the USC regime.

TI Bounding the detection efficiency threshold in Bell tests using multiple
   copies of the maximally entangled two-qubit state carried by a single
   pair of particles
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB In this paper, we investigate the critical efficiency of detectors to observe Bell nonlocality using multiple copies of the maximally entangled two-qubit state carried by a single pair of particles, such as hyperentangled states, and the product of Pauli measurements. It is known that in a Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt (CHSH) Bell test the symmetric detection efficiency of 82.84% can be tolerated for the two-qubit maximally entangled state. We beat this enigmatic threshold by entangling two particles with multiple degrees of freedom. The obtained upper bounds of the symmetric detection efficiency thresholds are 80.86%, 73.99%, and 69.29% for two, three, and four copies of the two-qubit maximally entangled state, respectively. The number of measurements and outcomes in the respective cases are 4, 8, and 16. To find the improved thresholds, we use large-scale convex optimization tools, which allows us to significantly go beyond state-of-the-art results. The proof is exact up to three copies, while for four copies it is due to reliable numerical computations. Specifically, we used linear programming to obtain the two-copy threshold and the corresponding Bell inequality, and convex optimization based on Gilbert's algorithm for three and four copies of the two-qubit state. We show analytically that the symmetric detection efficiency threshold decays exponentially with the number of copies of the two-qubit state. Our techniques can also be applied to more general Bell nonlocality scenarios with more than two parties.

TI Quantum-classical correspondence of a system of interacting bosons in a

SO QUANTUM
AB We study the quantum-classical correspondence of an experimentally accessible system of interacting bosons in a tilted triple-well potential. With the semiclassical analysis, we get a better understanding of the different phases of the quantum system and how they could be used for quantum information science. In the integrable limits, our analysis of the stationary points of the semiclassical Hamiltonian reveals critical points associated with second-order quantum phase transitions. In the nonintegrable domain, the system exhibits crossovers. Depending on the parameters and quantities, the quantum-classical correspondence holds for very few bosons. In some parameter regions, the ground state is robust (highly sensitive) to changes in the interaction strength (tilt amplitude), which may be of use for quantum information protocols (quantum sensing).

TI Strong entanglement criteria for mixed states, based on uncertainty
   relations
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICS A-MATHEMATICAL AND THEORETICAL
AB We propose an entanglement criterion, specially designed for mixed states, based on uncertainty relation and the Wigner-Yanase skew information. The variances in this uncertainty relation do not involve any classical mixing uncertainty, and is therefore purely of quantum mechanical nature. We show that a large class of mixed entangled states can be characterized by our criterion. We demonstrate its utility for several generalized mixed entangled state including two-qubit and two-qutrit Werner states and it turns out, for the states discussed in this paper, to be stronger than any other known criterion in identifying the correct domain of relevant parameters for entanglement. The relevant uncertainty relation reduces to the Schrodinger-Robertson inequality for pure states.

TI Soft-controlled quantum gate with enhanced robustness and undegraded
   dynamics in Rydberg atoms
SO EPJ QUANTUM TECHNOLOGY
AB Rydberg atoms have exhibited excellent potentials to become a competent platform of implementing quantum computation, which demands to execute various quantum gates fast and faithfully. We propose a dynamic mechanism of two interacting Rydberg atoms for implementing a high-fidelity SWAP gate on ground-state manifolds, where the amplitude modulation and soft quantum control of lasers driving ground-Rydberg state transitions are elaborately matched with the interaction strength between atoms so as to engineer the desired transformation of atomic states. Compared with the recent Rydberg-atom SWAP gate scheme, the present one possesses the undegraded first-order dynamics and shows an interference-induced suppression of the doubly-excited Rydberg state, so it costs shorter gate time and exhibits greater robustness against atomic decay and deviations in the interatomic separation (interaction strengths). The present mechanism of implementing a SWAP gate on interacting Rydberg atoms could facilitate high-fidelity demonstrations of atomic ground state transformation and further exploitation of peculiar dynamics.

TI Lattice Hamiltonians and stray interactions within quantum processors
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW APPLIED
AB Developing Hamiltonian models for quantum processors with many qubits on the same chip is crucial for advancing quantum computing technologies. Stray couplings between qubits lead to errors in gate operations. This study underscores the importance of incorporating lattice Hamiltonians into quantum circuit design. By comparing many-body effects with two-body stray couplings, we show how adjusting circuit parameters can increase two-qubit-gate fidelity. We find that loosely decoupled qubits result in weaker stray interactions and higher gate fidelity, challenging conventional assumptions. We investigate the scenario where three-body ZZZ interaction surpasses two-body ZZ interactions, highlighting the transformative potential of lattice Hamiltonians for novel multiqubit gates. Moreover, we investigate the cross-resonance gate within the lattice-Hamiltonian framework and examine the impact of microwave pulses on stray coupling. This emphasizes the necessity of developing a comprehensive theoretical framework that includes lattice interactions, which are now critical given the sophistication of contemporary quantum hardware. These insights are vital for developing fault-tolerant quantum computing and next-generation quantum processors.

TI Performance analysis of quantum key distribution using polarized
   coherent-states in free-space channel
SO CHINESE PHYSICS B
AB In free space channel, continuous-variable quantum key distribution (CV-QKD) using polarized coherent-states can not only make the signal state more stable and less susceptible to interference based on the polarization non-sensitive of the free-space channel, but also reduce the noise introduced by phase interference. However, arbitrary continuous modulation can not be carried out in the past polarization coding, resulting in that the signal state can not obtain arbitrary continuous value in Poincare space, and the security analysis of CV-QKD using polarized coherent-states in free space is not complete. Here we propose a new modulation method to extend the modulation range of signal states with an optical-fiber-based polarization controller. In particular, in terms of the main influence factors in the free-space channel, we utilize the beam extinction and elliptical model when considering the transmittance and adopt the formulation of secret key rate. In addition, the performance of the proposed scheme under foggy weather is also taken into consideration to reveal the influence of severe weather. Numerical simulation shows that the proposed scheme is seriously affected by attenuation under foggy weather. The protocol fails when visibility is less than 1 km. At the same time, the wavelength can affect the performance of the proposed scheme. Specifically, under foggy weather, the longer the wavelength, the smaller the attenuation coefficient, and the better the transmission performance. Our proposed scheme can expand the modulation range of signal state, and supplement the security research of the scheme in the free-space channel, thus can provide theoretical support for subsequent experiments.

TI Post Quantum Design in SPDM for Device Authentication and Key
   Establishment
SO CRYPTOGRAPHY
AB The Security Protocol and Data Model (SPDM) defines a set of flows whose purpose includes the authentication of a computing device's hardware identity. SPDM also allows for the creation of a secure session wherein data communication between two devices has both confidentiality and integrity protection. The present version of SPDM, namely version 1.2, relies upon traditional asymmetric cryptographic algorithms, and these algorithms are known to be vulnerable to quantum attacks. This paper describes the means by which support for post-quantum (PQ) cryptography can be added to the SPDM protocol in order to prepare SPDM for the upcoming world of quantum computing. As part of this paper, we examine the SPDM 1.2 protocol and discuss various aspects of using PQC algorithms, including negotiation of the use of post-quantum cryptography (PQC) algorithms, support for device identity reporting, mechanisms for device authentication, and establishing a secure session. We consider so-called "hybrid modes" where both classical and PQC algorithms are used to achieve security properties, especially given the fact that these modes are important during the transition period from the classical to the quantum computing regime. We also share our experience with implementing a software embodiment of PQC in SPDM, namely "PQ-SPDM", and we provide benchmarks that evaluate a subset of the winning NIST PQC algorithms.

TI Experimental demonstration of a reconfigurable free-space receiver
   implementing polarization routing and filtering for daytime quantum key
   distribution
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB Free-space quantum key distribution (QKD) systems are often designed to implement polarization-encoding protocols. Alternatively, time-bin/phase-encoding protocols are considerably more challenging to perform over a channel experiencing atmospheric turbulence. However, over the last decade, new and improved optical platforms have revived the interest in them. In this paper, we present a free-space multi-protocol receiver designed to work with three different time-bin/phase-encoding protocols highlighting its interoperability with different systems and architectures for potential satellite-based communications. We also present a detailed analysis of different experimental configurations when implementing the coherent one-way (COW) protocol in a free-space channel, as well as a polarization filtering technique showing how time-bin/phase-encoding protocols could be used for QKD applications in daylight conditions. We demonstrate secret key rates of several kbps for channels with a total 30 dB attenuation even with moderately high QBERs of approximate to 3.5%. Moreover, a 2.6 dB improvement in the signal to noise ratio is achieved by filtering background light in the polarization degree of freedom, a technique that could be used in daylight QKD.

TI Broadband Biphoton Generation and Polarization Splitting in a Monolithic
   AlGaAs Chip
SO ACS PHOTONICS
AB The ability to combine various advanced functionalities on a single chip is a key issue for both classical and quantum photonicbased technologies. On-chip generation and handling of orthogonally polarized photon pairs, one of the most used resources in quantum information protocols, is a central challenge for the development of scalable quantum photonics circuits; in particular, the management of spectrally broadband biphoton states, an asset attracting growing attention for its capability to convey large-scale quantum information in a single spatial mode, is missing. Here, we demonstrate a monolithic AlGaAs chip, including the generation of broadband orthogonally polarized photon pairs and their polarization splitting; 85% of the pairs are deterministically separated by the chip over a 60 nm bandwidth. The quality of the two-photon interference at the chip output is assessed via a Hong-Ou-Mandel experiment displaying a raw visibility of 75.5% over the same bandwidth. These results, obtained for the first time at room temperature and telecom wavelength, in a platform combining strong confinement, high second-order nonlinearity, electro-optic effect, and direct bandgap, confirm the validity of our approach and represent a significant step toward miniaturized and easy-to-handle photonic devices working in the broadband regime for quantum information processing.

TI Quantum Reservoir Computing for Speckle Disorder Potentials
SO CONDENSED MATTER
AB Quantum reservoir computing is a machine learning approach designed to exploit the dynamics of quantum systems with memory to process information. As an advantage, it presents the possibility to benefit from the quantum resources provided by the reservoir combined with a simple and fast training strategy. In this work, this technique is introduced with a quantum reservoir of spins and it is applied to find the ground state energy of an additional quantum system. The quantum reservoir computer is trained with a linear model to predict the lowest energy of a particle in the presence of different speckle disorder potentials. The performance of the task is analyzed with a focus on the observable quantities extracted from the reservoir and it is shown to be enhanced when two-qubit correlations are employed.

TI Enhancing the Security of the BB84 Quantum Key Distribution Protocol
   against Detector-Blinding Attacks via the Use of an Active Quantum
   Entropy Source in the Receiving Station
SO ENTROPY
AB True randomness is necessary for the security of any cryptographic protocol, including quantum key distribution (QKD). In QKD transceivers, randomness is supplied by one or more local, private entropy sources of quantum origin which can be either passive (e.g., a beam splitter) or active (e.g., an electronic quantum random number generator). In order to better understand the role of randomness in QKD, I revisit the well-known "detector blinding" attack on the BB84 QKD protocol, which utilizes strong light to achieve undetectable and complete recovery of the secret key. I present two findings. First, I show that the detector-blinding attack was in fact an attack on the receiver's local entropy source. Second, based on this insight, I propose a modified receiver station and a statistical criterion which together enable the robust detection of any bright-light attack and thus restore security.

TI Characterization of Quantum and Classical Critical Points for an

The model can be mapped exactly into two independent standard single-impurity spin-boson models where the role of the tunneling parameter is played by the spin-spin coupling. The dynamics of the magnetization are analyzed for different levels of (an)isotropy. The existence of a decoherence-free subspace, as well as of different classical regimes separated by a critical temperature, and symptoms of quantum (first-order and Kosterlitz-Thouless type) phase transitions in the Ohmic regime are brought to light.

TI Repeated radiation damage and thermal annealing of avalanche photodiodes
SO EPJ QUANTUM TECHNOLOGY
AB Avalanche photodiodes (APDs) are well-suited for single-photon detection on quantum communication satellites as they are a mature technology with high detection efficiency without requiring cryogenic cooling. They are, however, prone to significantly increased thermal noise caused by in-orbit radiation damage. Previous work demonstrated that a one-time application of thermal annealing reduces radiation-damage-induced APD thermal noise. Here we examine the effect of cyclical proton irradiation and thermal annealing. We use an accelerated testing environment which emulates a realistic two-year operating profile of a satellite in low-Earth-orbit. We show that repeated thermal annealing is effective at maintaining thermal noise of silicon APDs within a range suitable for quantum key distribution throughout the nominal mission life, and beyond. We examine two strategies-annealing at a fixed period of time, and annealing only when the thermal noise exceeds a pre-defined limit. We find both strategies exhibit similar thermal noise at end-of-life, with a slight overall advantage to annealing conditionally. We also observe that afterpulsing probability of the detector increases with cumulative proton irradiation. This knowledge helps guide design and tasking decisions for future space-borne quantum communication applications.

TI Modelling non-Markovian noise in driven superconducting qubits
SO QUANTUM SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB Non-Markovian noise can be a significant source of errors in superconducting qubits. We develop gate sequences utilising mirrored pseudoidentities that allow us to characterise and model the effects of non-Markovian noise on both idle and driven qubits. We compare three approaches to modelling the observed noise: (i) a Markovian noise model, (ii) a model including interactions with a two-level system (TLS), (iii) a model utilising the post Markovian master equation, which we show to be equivalent to the qubit-TLS model in certain regimes. When running our noise characterisation circuits on a superconducting qubit device we find that purely Markovian noise models cannot reproduce the experimental data. Our model based on a qubit-TLS interaction, on the other hand, is able to closely capture the observed experimental behaviour for both idle and driven qubits. We investigate the stability of the noise properties of the hardware over time, and find that the parameter governing the qubit-TLS interaction strength fluctuates significantly even over short time-scales of a few minutes. Finally, we evaluate the changes in the noise parameters when increasing the qubit drive pulse amplitude. We find that although the hardware noise parameters fluctuate significantly over different days, their drive pulse induced relative variation is rather well defined within computed uncertainties: both the phase error and the qubit-TLS interaction strength change significantly with the pulse strength, with the phase error changing quadratically with the amplitude of the applied pulse. Since our noise model can closely describe the behaviour of idle and driven qubits, it is ideally suited to be used in the development of quantum error mitigation and correction methods.

   Hardness Assumptions
SO IEEE OPEN JOURNAL OF THE COMPUTER SOCIETY
AB With the rapid advancement of quantum computing, many classical encryption schemes are becoming increasingly vulnerable to quantum attacks, highlighting the urgent need for post-quantum cryptographic solutions that can withstand this emerging threat. In this context, this article introduces the Q-Problem, a novel post-quantum hardness assumption specifically designed to resist quantum adversaries by presenting them with a vast and computationally infeasible preimage space. Building on this foundation, we propose Q-KIE (a post-quantum key-independent encryption scheme), which replaces persistent cryptographic keys with ephemeral, message-bound secret holders. Q-KIE features dynamic complexity tuning, offering flexible security levels and maintaining efficient performance across both classical and quantum computing environments. Detailed analysis and comprehensive evaluations demonstrate the scheme's strong potential in preserving confidentiality, integrity, and computational practicality, positioning it as a promising candidate for hybrid and post-quantum cryptographic frameworks.

TI Tunable Inductive Coupler for High-Fidelity Gates Between Fluxonium
   Qubits
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB The fluxonium qubit is a promising candidate for quantum computation due to its long coherence times and large anharmonicity. We present a tunable coupler that realizes strong inductive coupling between two heavy-fluxonium qubits, each with approximately 50 -MHz frequencies and approximately 5-GHz anharmonicities. The coupler enables the qubits to have a large tuning range of XX coupling strengths (-35 to 75 MHz). The ZZ coupling strength is <3 kHz across the entire coupler bias range and <100 Hz at the coupler off position. These qualities lead to fast high-fid elity si ngle- and two-qubit gates. By driving at the difference frequency of the two qubits, we realize a ,root iSWAP gat e in 2 58 ns with fidelity 99.72%, and by driving at the sum frequency of the two qubits, we achieve a root bSWAP gate in 102 ns with fidelity 99.91%. This latter gate is only five qubit Larmor periods in length. We r un cros s -entropy benchmarking ,root bSWAP fo r over 20 consecutive hours and measure stable gate fidelities, with b SWAP drift (2 sigma) <0.02% and ,root iSWAP drift <0.08%.

We introduce estimators based on randomised measurements, which use decision diagrams to sample from probability distributions on measurement bases. This approach generalises previously known uniform and locally-biased randomised estimators. The decision diagrams are constructed given target quantum operators and can be optimised considering different strategies. We show numerically that the estimators introduced here can produce more precise estimates on some quantum chemistry Hamiltonians, compared to previously known randomised protocols and Pauli grouping methods.

Few of the phenomenon include, for instance, light storage, ultra-slow and ultra-fast propagation, optical transparency, and quantum entanglement via quantum coherence or superposition. The understanding of these phenomenon of milestone implications paved the way for the invention of novel classical and quantum technology. In this article, we present detailed theoretical and numerical demonstration on the dispersion-dependent phenomenon of slow and fast light, optically induced transparency, and photon drag. For this, we employ a three-level scheme of an ensemble of GaAs\AlGaAs double quantum dot molecule in cascade configuration. In particular, by tuning the medium dispersion we predict interesting interplay between ultra-slow and ultra-fast light propagation with vanishing, infinite, ultra-positive and ultra-negative group velocities, and optical-assisted quantum transparency. The quantum coherence of the dressed states modifies considerably the optical properties of the system in view of dispersion, absorption, electron energy loss, transmission, and photon drag. An interesting interplay between ultra-slow to ultra-fast propagation is found by tuning various optical parameters. The calculated superluminal value of group velocity is +/- 6x1011 m s-1. We also predict light propagation at vanishing and infinite group velocity. The calculated light drag is +/- 6x10-6 rad/m.

TI Transverse mode control in quantum enhanced interferometers: a review
   and recommendations for a new generation
SO OPTICA
AB Adaptive optics has made significant advancement over the past decade, becoming the essential technology in a wide variety of applications, particularly in the realm of quantum optics. One key area of impact is gravitational -wave detection, where quantum correlations are distributed over kilometer -long distances by beams with hundreds of kilowatts of optical power. Decades of development were required to develop robust and stable techniques to sense mismatches between the Gaussian beams and the resonators, all while maintaining the quantum correlations. Here we summarize the crucial advancements in transverse mode control required for gravitational -wave detection. As we look towards the advanced designs of future detectors, we highlight key challenges and offer recommendations for the design of these instruments. We conclude the review with a discussion of the broader application of adaptive optics in quantum technologies: communication, computation, imaging, and sensing.

TI Quantum routing with teleportation
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB We study the problem of implementing arbitrary permutations of qubits under interaction constraints in quantum systems that allow for arbitrarily fast local operations and classical communication (LOCC). In particular, we show examples of speedups over swap-based and more general unitary routing methods by distributing entanglement and using LOCC to perform quantum teleportation. We further describe an example of an interaction graph for which teleportation gives a logarithmic speedup in the worst-case routing time over swap-based routing. We also study limits on the speedup afforded by quantum teleportation-showing an O(root N log N) upper bound on the separation in routing time for any interaction graph-and give tighter bounds for some common classes of graphs.

TI Nonlinear transformation of complex amplitudes via quantum singular
   value transformation
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Due to the linearity of quantum operations, it is not straightforward to implement nonlinear transformations on a quantum computer, making some practical tasks like a neural network hard to achieve. In this paper, we define a task called nonlinear transformation of complex amplitudes and provide an algorithm to achieve this task. Specifically, we construct a block encoding of complex amplitudes from a state preparation unitary. This allows us to transform the complex amplitudes by using quantum singular value transformation. We evaluate the required overhead in terms of input dimension and precision, which reveals that the algorithm depends on the roughly square root of input dimension and achieves an exponential speedup on precision compared with previous work. We also discuss its possible applications to quantum machine learning, where complex amplitudes encoding classical or quantum data are processed by the proposed method. In this paper, we provide a promising way to introduce the highly complex nonlinearity of the quantum states, which is essentially missing in quantum mechanics.

TI Efficient Magic State Distillation by Zero-Level Distillation
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB Magic state distillation (MSD) is an essential element for universal fault-tolerant quantum computing, which distills a high-fidelity magic state from noisy magic states using ideal (error-corrected) Clifford operations. For ideal Clifford operations, it needs to be performed on the logical qubits and hence incurs a large spatiotemporal overhead, which is one of the major bottlenecks for the realization of fault-tolerant quantum computers (FTQCs). Here we propose zero-level distillation, which prepares a high-fidelity logical magic state at the physical level, namely zero level, using physical qubits and nearest-neighbor two-qubit gates on a square lattice. We develop a zero-level distillation circuit and show that distillation can be made even more efficient than the conventional sophisticated approaches with logical level distillations. The key idea involves the Knill et al.-type distillation using the Steane code and its careful mapping to the square-lattice architecture with error detection. The distilled magic state on the Steane-code state is then teleported or converted to surface codes. We numerically find that the error rate of the logical magic state scales as approximately 100 x p2 in terms of the physical error rate p. For example, with a physical error rate of p = 10-4 (10-3), the logical error rate is reduced to pL = 10-6 (10-4), resulting in an improvement of 2 (1) orders of magnitude. This contributes to reducing both space and time overhead for early FTQC as well as full-fledged FTQC combined with conventional multilevel distillation protocols.

TI An experimental investigation of quantum frequency correlations
   resilience against white and colored noise
SO QUANTUM SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB Quantum technologies based on photons rely on correlated pairs generated through nonlinear optics. Hence, understanding the impact of disturbances is of paramount importance for the development of this innovative field. Here we focus on the quantum spectroscopy as one of the most promising quantum technique showing a realistic perspective for a future employment. In this field, the most interesting disturbance is represented by the frequency noise. We present an experiment aimed at testing and characterizing the resilience against different levels of white and colored noise and we include simulations to generalize our findings. With this work we demonstrate that the spectroscopical properties of both the target and the noise, as well as the strength of the quantum correlations, play a crucial role and could have e huge impact on the performances, especially in terms of achievable spectral resolution. Remarkably, the presence of a specific region where the technology is always robust against any kind of noise represents an advantage allowing to deal with optimal measurements and fully exploit the capabilities of this technology.

TI Regressions on quantum neural networks at maximal expressivity
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB Considering a universal deep neural network organized as a series of nested qubit rotations, accomplished by adjustable data re-uploads we analyze its expressivity. This ability to approximate continuous functions in regression tasks is quantified making use of a partial Fourier decomposition of the generated output and systematically benchmarked with the aid of a teacher-student scheme. While the maximal expressive power increases with the depth of the network and the number of qubits, it is fundamentally bounded by the data encoding mechanism. However, we show that the measurement of the network generated output drastically modifies the attainability of this bound. Global-entangling measurements on the network can saturate the maximal expressive bound leading to an enhancement of the approximation capabilities of the network compared to local readouts of the individual qubits in non-entangling networks. We attribute this enhancement to a larger survival set of Fourier harmonics when decomposing the output signal.

TI Temperature gradient and asymmetric steady state correlations in
   dissipatively coupled cascaded optomechanical systems
SO PHYSICA SCRIPTA
AB The interaction between a light mode and a mechanical oscillator via radiation pressure in optomechanical systems is an excellent platform for a multitude of applications in quantum technologies. In this work we study the dynamics of a pair of optomechanical systems interacting dissipatively with a wave guide in a unidirectional way. Focusing on the regime where the cavity modes can be adiabatically eliminated, we derive an effective coupling between the two mechanical modes and explore the classical and quantum correlations established between the modes in both the transient and the stationary regime, highlighting their asymmmetrical nature due to the unidirectional coupling. Noteworthy, we find that a constant amount of steady correlations can exist at long times. Furthermore we show that this unidirectional coupling establishes a temperature gradient between the mirrors, depending on the frequencies' detuning. We additionally analyze the power spectrum of the output guide field and we show how, thanks to the chiral coupling, from such spectrum it is possible to reconstruct the spectra of each single mirror.

TI Statistical Benchmarking of Scalable Photonic Quantum Systems
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB Targeting at the realization of scalable photonic quantum technologies, the generation of many photons, their propagation in large optical networks, and a subsequent detection and analysis of sophisticated quantum correlations are essential for the understanding of macroscopic quantum systems. In this experimental contribution, we explore the joint operation of all mentioned ingredients. We benchmark our time-multiplexing framework that includes a high-performance source of multiphoton states and a large multiplexing network, together with unique detectors with high photon-number resolution, readily available for distributing quantum light and measuring complex quantum correlations. Using an adaptive approach that employs flexible time bins, rather than static ones, we successfully verify high-order nonclassical correlations of many photons distributed over many modes. By exploiting the symmetry of our system and using powerful analysis tools, we can analyze correlations that would be inaccessible by classical means otherwise. In particular, we produce on the order of ten photons and distribute them over 64 modes. Nonclassicality is verified with correlation functions up to the 128th order and statistical significances of up to 20 standard deviations.

TI Delay-induced spontaneous dark-state generation from two distant excited
   atoms
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB We investigate the collective non-Markovian dynamics of two fully excited two-level atoms coupled to a one-dimensional waveguide in the presence of delay. We demonstrate that analogous to the well-known superfluorescence phenomena, where an inverted atomic ensemble synchronizes to enhance its emission, there is a "subfluorescence" effect that synchronizes the atoms into an entangled dark state depending on the interatomic separation. The phenomenon can lead to a two-photon bound state in the continuum. Our results are pertinent to long-distance quantum networks, presenting a mechanism for spontaneous entanglement generation between distant quantum emitters.

SO PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACM ON PROGRAMMING LANGUAGES-PACMPL
AB CoqQ is a framework for reasoning about quantum programs in the Coq proof assistant. Its main components are: a deeply embedded quantum programming language, in which classic quantum algorithms are easily expressed, and an expressive program logic for proving properties of programs. CoqQ is foundational: the program logic is formally proved sound with respect to a denotational semantics based on state-of-art mathematical libraries (MathComp and MathComp Analysis). CoqQ is also practical: assertions can use Dirac expressions, which eases concise specifications, and proofs can exploit local and parallel reasoning, which minimizes verification effort. We illustrate the applicability of CoqQ with many examples from the literature.

TI Entanglement transitivity problems
SO NPJ QUANTUM INFORMATION
AB One of the goals of science is to understand the relation between a whole and its parts, as exemplified by the problem of certifying the entanglement of a system from the knowledge of its reduced states. Here, we focus on a different but related question: can a collection of marginal information reveal new marginal information? We answer this affirmatively and show that (non-) entangled marginal states may exhibit (meta)transitivity of entanglement, i.e., implying that a different target marginal must be entangled. By showing that the global n-qubit state compatible with certain two-qubit marginals in a tree form is unique, we prove that transitivity exists for a system involving an arbitrarily large number of qubits. We also completely characterize-in the sense of providing both the necessary and sufficient conditions-when (meta)transitivity can occur in a tripartite scenario when the two-qudit marginals given are either the Werner states or the isotropic states. Our numerical results suggest that in the tripartite scenario, entanglement transitivity is generic among the marginals derived from pure states.

TI Comparing Adiabatic Quantum Computers for satellite images feature
   extraction
SO FUTURE GENERATION COMPUTER SYSTEMS-THE INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ESCIENCE
AB Adiabatic Quantum Computers (AQCs) are special-purpose devices that promise to speed up the resolution of hard combinatorial optimization problems by exploiting quantum mechanical phenomena. Despite representing one of the most mature quantum computational paradigms, AQCs are often benchmarked on spin -glass problems that conveniently mimic their internal structure, and their performances are usually compared to those of suboptimal Simulated Annealing solvers. In this work, we evaluate the capabilities of AQCs to extract features from a dataset of low-resolution satellite images of airplanes, exploiting an approach based on matrix factorization. We assess the performance of three generations of quantum devices provided by the D-Wave company by analyzing their behavior via selected evaluation metrics as a function of the problem size. We also compare against classical results obtained with a commercial solver. Additionally, we outline a parametertuning procedure that allows for harnessing the full potential of AQCs. Although the quantum devices still tend to underperform their classical counterparts, we observe the two most recent AQCs exhibiting superior performance for the tested instances with the smallest size. Additionally, our results indicate incremental performance improvements across new AQCs generations. These observations suggest cautious optimism about the potential future applicability of such computational tools.

TI Quantum Imaging of Ferromagnetic van der Waals Magnetic Domain
   Structures at Ambient Conditions
SO ACS APPLIED MATERIALS & INTERFACES
AB Recently discovered 2D van der Waals magnetic materials, and specifically iron-germanium-telluride (Fe5GeTe2), have attracted significant attention both from a fundamental perspective and for potential applications. Key open questions concern their domain structure and magnetic phase transition temperature as a function of sample thickness and external field, as well as implications for integration into devices such as magnetic memories and logic. Here we address key questions using a nitrogen-vacancy center based quantum magnetic microscope, enabling direct imaging of the magnetization of Fe5GeTe2 at submicrometer spatial resolution as a function of temperature, magnetic field, and thickness. This quantum imaging technique provides noninvasive, high-sensitivity measurements with high spatial resolution under ambient conditions, making it particularly well suited for probing 2D magnets. We employ spatially resolved measures, including magnetization variance and cross-correlation, and find a significant spread in transition temperature yet with no clear dependence on thickness down to 15 nm. We also identify previously unknown stripe features in the optical as well as magnetic images, which we attribute to modulations of the constituting elements during crystal synthesis and subsequent oxidation. Our results suggest that the magnetic anisotropy in this material does not play a crucial role in their magnetic properties, leading to a magnetic phase transition of Fe5GeTe2 which is largely thickness-independent down to 15 nm. Our findings could be significant in designing future spintronic devices, magnetic memories, and logic with 2D van der Waals magnetic materials.

AB The growth of quantum technologies is attracting the interest of many students eager to learn concepts such as quantum entanglement or quantum superposition. However, the non-intuitive nature of these concepts poses a challenge to understanding them. Here, we present an entangled photon system which can perform a Bell test, i.e. the CHSH inequality, and can obtain the complete tomography of the two-photon state. The proposed setup is versatile, cost-effective and allows for multiple classroom operating modes. We present two variants, both facilitating the measurement of Bell inequalities and quantum state tomography. Experimental results showcase successful manipulation of the quantum state of the photons, achieving high-fidelity entangled states and significant violations of Bell's inequalities. Our setup's simplicity and affordability enhances accessibility for less specialized laboratories, allowing students to familiarize themselves with quantum physics concepts.

TI Multipurpose platform for analog quantum simulation
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Atom -based quantum simulators have had many successes in tackling challenging quantum many -body problems, owing to the precise and dynamical control that they provide over the systems' parameters. They are, however, often optimized to address a specific type of problem. Here, we present the design and implementation of a 6Li-based quantum gas platform that provides wide-ranging capabilities and is able to address a variety of quantum many -body problems. Our two -chamber architecture relies on a robust combination of gray molasses and optical transport from a laser -cooling chamber to a glass cell with excellent optical access. There, we first create unitary Fermi superfluids in a three-dimensional axially symmetric harmonic trap and characterize them using in situ thermometry, reaching temperatures below 20 nK. This allows us to enter the deep superfluid regime with samples of extreme diluteness, where the interparticle spacing is sufficiently large for direct single -atom imaging. Second, we generate optical lattice potentials with triangular and honeycomb geometry in which we study diffraction of molecular Bose-Einstein condensates, and show how going beyond the Kapitza-Dirac regime allows us to unambiguously distinguish between the two geometries. With the ability to probe quantum many -body physics in both discrete and continuous space, and its suitability for bulk and single -atom imaging, our setup represents an important step towards achieving a wide -scope quantum simulator.

TI A hybrid quantum-classical particle-in-cell method for plasma
   simulations
SO FUTURE GENERATION COMPUTER SYSTEMS-THE INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ESCIENCE
AB We present a hybrid quantum-classical electrostatic Particle-in-Cell (PIC) method, where the electrostatic field Poisson solver is implemented on a quantum computer simulator using a hybrid classical-quantum Neural Network (HNN) using data-driven and physics-informed learning approaches. The HNN is trained on classical PIC simulation results and executed via a PennyLane quantum simulator. The remaining computational steps, including particle motion and field interpolation, are performed on a classical system. To evaluate the accuracy and computational cost of this hybrid approach, we test the hybrid quantum-classical electrostatic PIC against the two-stream instability, a standard benchmark in plasma physics. Our results show that the quantum Poisson solver achieves comparable accuracy to classical methods. It also provides insights into the feasibility of using quantum computing and HNNs for plasma simulations. We also discuss the computational overhead associated with current quantum computer simulators, showing the challenges and potential advantages of hybrid quantum-classical numerical methods.

TI Spatial Control of Photonic Quantum States (Invited)
SO ACTA OPTICA SINICA
AB Significance Photons have several important degrees-of-freedom available for control belonging to the spatial domain, such as the path and orbital angular momentum (OAM) degrees-of-freedom. These available multiple spatial degrees- offreedom and the high dimensionality of each degree-of-freedom provide for us diverse spatial methods, which can achieve spatial control of photonic quantum states in multiple degrees-of- freedom, high dimensionality, and multi- photons. Specifically, the preparation of spatially entangled photon states and their applications in optical quantum information have attracted extensive attention. Both path and OAM degrees-of-freedom can theoretically construct infinite-dimensional Hilbert spaces. Therefore, path and OAM degrees- of-freedom have inherent advantages in realizing the field of highdimensional coding, which has attracted more extensive attention from researchers. The high- dimensional coding and highdimensional entanglement of the path and OAM degrees-of- freedom themselves continue to break records. The multidegree-of-freedom entangled photonic modulation schemes in which two or more degrees-of- freedom are jointly involved have likewise made progress. It is important to summarize the existing research on spatial control of photonic quantum state to promote the future development of the field.
   Progress The encoding of quantum information in single photons has evolved from a single degree-of-freedom to multiple degrees-of- freedom encoded together. On-demand conversion of quantum information among different degree-of-freedom through linear optical elements and such active modulation has built a series of quantum optical platforms such as weak measurements and quantum walks. Two-photon entangled states also emerge from the two-dimensional space of a single degree-of-freedom and are realized in multi-degree-of-freedom and high-dimensional systems. For two- photon spatialdomain entanglement, the original polarization-entangled photons are converted into OAM-entangled photons by SLM. Different polarizations can be loaded with different OAMs by a Sagnac interferometer, and two- photon entanglement of two photons with different OAMs has been reported. Subsequent work increases the OAM quantum number of entangled photons to 10010. In addition to the above preparation of OAM entangled photons using entanglement conversion, twophoton entanglement in Hilbert space higher than 100 dimensions has been realized by preparing a high-dimensional OAM entangled source through spontaneous parametric down- conversion and further combining it with the modulation of the radial modes of photons. At the same time, measurements of high-dimensional entangled sources develop in parallel. The successful realization of HOM interference based on multi- degree- of-freedom optical quantum states paves the way for the expansion of optical quantum technology in higher dimensions. Although the quantum modulation of the space domain of multi-photons is complex and difficult, researchers continue to make important progress in the preparation of highdimensional entangled states and optical quantum information processing. The study of space- domain modulation of optical quantum states not only allows for selecting photons generated by transitions under spontaneous down conversion in free space but also considers using a variety of microstructures for the generation and modulation of photons. These microstructured devices allow for efficient beam modulation, localized control of polarization, and a significant enhancement of the efficiency of the emitted and detected photons. In the field of quantum photo generation, the generation of down converted photon pairs with spontaneous parametrization over 100 paths has already been achieved by integrating metal lens arrays with nonlinear crystals on a two-dimensional hypersurface. This holds the promise of generating highdimensional hyperentangled and multiphoton states in an integrated and efficient manner.
   Conclusions and Prospects In this review, starting from the linear control of a single photon in the spatial domain, we successively describe the spatial coding and transformation of a single photon, the preparation and measurement of twophoton entangled states, as well as the preparation of multi-photon high-dimensional spatial entangled states and their applications in quantum information. We mainly focus on the control in multi- degree- of-freedom and high-dimensional quantum information transformation. In addition, we discuss the recent progress on the spatial photonic quantum states in preparation, coding, measurement, and application. Meanwhile, possible solutions to some key issues are also explored. However, the study on the spatial control of photonic quantum states is still in its infancy and flourishing. There are many

TI Realizing a deep reinforcement learning agent for real-time quantum
   feedback
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Realizing the full potential of quantum technologies requires precise real-time control on time scales much shorter than the coherence time. Model-free reinforcement learning promises to discover efficient feedback strategies from scratch without relying on a description of the quantum system. However, developing and training a reinforcement learning agent able to operate in real-time using feedback has been an open challenge. Here, we have implemented such an agent for a single qubit as a sub-microsecond-latency neural network on a field-programmable gate array (FPGA). We demonstrate its use to efficiently initialize a superconducting qubit and train the agent based solely on measurements. Our work is a first step towards adoption of reinforcement learning for the control of quantum devices and more generally any physical device requiring low-latency feedback.

TI Narrowband telecom-band polarization-entangled photon source by
   superposed monolithic cavities
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB A high -quality narrowband polarization -entangled source in the telecom band is preferred to avoid frequency dispersion for long-distance transmission in optical fibers and to efficiently couple with telecom -band quantum memories. Here, we report narrowband, telecom -band, polarization -entangled photon pair generation based on the superposition of single -longitudinal -mode photon pairs from two monolithic nonlinear crystal cavities in a passively stable interferometer based on beam displacers. The photon pairs generated from the cavities exhibit a high coincidence to accidental coincidence ratio of 20 000 and a bandwidth below 500 MHz. Two -photon polarization interference, Bell inequality, and quantum state tomography are performed to indicate the high quality of the entangled source. The current configuration demonstrates greater stability than traditional free space cavity -enhanced polarization -entangled state generation, which is promising for quantum communication applications.

TI How a quantum computer could accurately solve a hydrogen-air combustion
   model
SO DIGITAL DISCOVERY
AB A quantum circuit method for modeling steady state behavior of homogeneous hydrogen-air combustion is presented. Extensive empirical testing has pinpointed the factor determining accuracy of quantum circuit calculations. Specifically, the accuracy of the Harrow, Hassidim and Lloyd (HHL) algorithm has been benchmarked using Qiskit simulations. For random linear systems that were constricted by various criteria, the quantum solution was compared to the classical solution. The criteria investigated include orthogonality, condition number, orthonormality, angle between vectors within the linear system, diagonality, and the angle between the solution vector and the right-hand side (RHS) vector. The results of these rigorous tests show that the single most powerful factor in accuracy is the angle between the solution vector and the RHS vector. This insight was used to inform the preconditioning of two reduced models of hydrogen-air combustion. These models have been compared in terms of accuracy and degree of utility in terms of the physical system. This application area could exploit a quantum advantage via the poly-logarithmic scaling of HHL.

TI Propagation of perfect Laguerre-Gaussian entangled states in

SO PHYSICA SCRIPTA
AB We investigate the impacts of backward scattering (BS) of non-Kolmogorov turbulence on the entangled perfect Laguerre-Gaussian (PLG) beams. The explicit expressions for PLG quantum entanglement and quantum coherence are derived in the BS case. We find that the introduction of BS reduces the entanglement and coherence, disrupts the initial decay characteristics, and induces the revival of entanglement and coherence, in which sense turbulence may possess a non-Markovian (memory) effect. As the OAM number increases, the non-Markovian feature increases logarithmically. In addition, the universal decay of entanglement and coherence and the non-Kolmogorov effects are also explored.

TI QUMA: Quantum Unified Medical Architecture Using Blockchain
SO INFORMATICS-BASEL
AB A significant increase in the demand for quality healthcare has resulted from people becoming more aware of health issues. With blockchain, healthcare providers may safely share patient information electronically, which is especially important given the sensitive nature of the data contained inside them. However, flaws in the current blockchain design have surfaced since the dawn of quantum computing systems. The study proposes a novel quantum-inspired blockchain system (Qchain) and constructs a unique entangled quantum medical record (EQMR) system with an emphasis on privacy and security. This Qchain relies on entangled states to connect its blocks. The automated production of the chronology indicator reduces storage capacity requirements by connecting entangled BloQ (blocks with quantum properties) to controlled activities. We use one qubit to store the hash value of each block. A lot of information regarding the quantum internet is included in the protocol for the entangled quantum medical record (EQMR). The EQMR can be accessed in Medical Internet of Things (M-IoT) systems that are kept private and secure, and their whereabouts can be monitored in the event of an emergency. The protocol also uses quantum authentication in place of more conventional methods like encryption and digital signatures. Mathematical research shows that the quantum converged blockchain (QCB) is highly safe against attacks such as external attacks, intercept measure -repeat attacks, and entanglement measure attacks. We present the reliability and auditability evaluations of the entangled BloQ, along with the quantum circuit design for computing the hash value. There is also a comparison between the suggested approach and several other quantum blockchain designs.

Conditions when the entanglement measure is entanglement monotone and convex are presented, as well as the interpretation of smoothed one-shot entanglement cost. Next, a difference between the measure under the local operation and classical communication and the separability-preserving operations is presented. Then, the relation between the convex roof extended method and the way here for the entanglement measures built from the geometric entanglement measure for pure states, as well as the concurrence for pure states in two-qubit systems are considered. It is also shown that the measure is monogamous for 2 circle times 2 circle times d system.

TI Dynamic thermalization on noisy quantum hardware
SO COMMUNICATIONS PHYSICS
AB Emulating thermal observables on a digital quantum computer is essential for quantum simulation of many-body physics. However, thermalization typically requires a large system size due to incorporating a thermal bath, whilst limited resources of near-term digital quantum processors allow for simulating relatively small systems. We show that thermal observables and fluctuations may be obtained for a small closed system without a thermal bath. Thermal observables occur upon classically averaging quantum mechanical observables over randomized variants of their time evolution that run independently on a digital quantum processor. Using an IBM quantum computer, we experimentally find thermal occupation probabilities with finite positive and negative temperatures defined by the initial state's energy. Averaging over random evolutions facilitates error mitigation, with the noise contributing to the temperature in the simulated observables. This result fosters probing the dynamical emergence of equilibrium properties of matter at finite temperatures on noisy intermediate-scale quantum hardware.

AB Quantum devices suffer from high error rates, which makes them ineffective for running practical applications. Quantum computers can be made fault tolerant using Quantum Error Correction (QEC), which protects quantum information by encoding logical qubits using data qubits and parity qubits. The data qubits collectively store the quantum information and the parity qubits are measured periodically to produce a syndrome, which is decoded by a classical decoder to identify the location and type of errors. To prevent errors from accumulating and causing a logical error, decoders must accurately identify errors in real-time, necessitating the use of hardware solutions because software decoders are slow. Ideally, a real-time decoder must match the performance of the Minimum-Weight Perfect Matching (MWPM) decoder. However, due to the complexity of the underlying Blossom algorithm, state-of-the-art real-time decoders either use lookup tables, which are not scalable, or use approximate decoding, which significantly increases logical error rates.
   In this paper, we leverage two key insights to enable practical real-time MWPM decoding. First, for near-term implementations (with redundancies up to distance d = 7) of surface codes, the Hamming weight of the syndromes tends to be quite small (less than or equal to 10). For this regime, we propose Astrea, which simply performs a brute-force search for the few hundred possible options to perform accurate decoding within a few nanoseconds (1ns average, 456ns worst-case), thus representing the first decoder to be able to do MWPM in real-time up-to distance 7. Second, even for codes that produce syndromes with higher Hamming weights (e.g d = 9) the search for optimal pairings can be made more efficient by simply discarding the weights that denote significantly lower probability than the logical error-rate of the code. For this regime, we propose a greedy design called Astrea-G, which filters high-cost weights and reorders the search from high-likelihood pairings to low-likelihood pairings to produce the most likely decoding within 1 mu s (average 450ns). Our evaluations show that Astrea-G provides similar logical error-rates as the software-based MWPM for up-to d = 9 codes while meeting the real-time decoding latency constraints.

TI Quantum Davidson algorithm for excited states
SO QUANTUM SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB Excited state properties play a pivotal role in various chemical and physical phenomena, such as charge separation and light emission. However, the primary focus of most existing quantum algorithms has been the ground state, as seen in quantum phase estimation and the variational quantum eigensolver (VQE). Although VQE-type methods have been extended to explore excited states, these methods grapple with optimization challenges. In contrast, the quantum Krylov subspace (QKS) method has been introduced to address both ground and excited states, positioning itself as a cost-effective alternative to quantum phase estimation. However, conventional QKS methodologies depend on a pre-generated subspace through real or imaginary-time evolutions. This subspace is inherently expansive and can be plagued with issues like slow convergence or numerical instabilities, often leading to relatively deep circuits. Our research presents an economic QKS algorithm, which we term the quantum Davidson (QDavidson) algorithm. This innovation hinges on the iterative expansion of the Krylov subspace and the incorporation of a pre-conditioner within the Davidson framework. By using the residues of eigenstates to expand the Krylov subspace, we manage to formulate a compact subspace that aligns closely with the exact solutions. This iterative subspace expansion paves the way for a more rapid convergence in comparison to other QKS techniques, such as the quantum Lanczos. Using quantum simulators, we employ the novel QDavidson algorithm to delve into the excited state properties of various systems, spanning from the Heisenberg spin model to real molecules. Compared to the existing QKS methods, the QDavidson algorithm not only converges swiftly but also demands a significantly shallower circuit. This efficiency establishes the QDavidson method as a pragmatic tool for elucidating both ground and excited state properties on quantum computing platforms.

AB Dynamical decoupling (DD) is normally ineffective when applied to DC measurement. In its straightforward implementation, DD nulls out DC signal as well while suppressing noise. This work proposes a phase relay method that is capable of continuously interrogating the DC signal over many DD cycles. We illustrate its efficacy when applied to the measurement of a weak DC magnetic field with an atomic spinor Bose-Einstein condensate. Sensitivities approaching standard quantum limit or Heisenberg limit are potentially realizable for a coherent spin state or a squeezed spin state of 10000 atoms, respectively, while ambient laboratory level noise is suppressed by DD. Our work offers a practical approach to mitigate the limitations of DD to DC measurement and would find other applications for resorting coherence in quantum sensing and quantum information processing research.

TI Entanglement verification with deep semisupervised machine learning
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Quantum entanglement lies at the heart of quantum information-processing tasks. Although many criteria have been proposed, efficient and scalable methods to detect the entanglement of generally given quantum states are still not available yet, particularly for high-dimensional and multipartite quantum systems. Based on FixMatch and Pseudo-Label methods, we propose a deep semisupervised learning model with a small portion of labeled data and a large portion of unlabeled data. The data-augmentation strategies are applied in this model by using the convexity of separable states and performing local unitary operations on the training data. We verify that our model has good generalization ability and gives rise to better accuracies than traditional supervised learning models with detailed examples.

TI Quantum simulations of chemistry in first quantization with any basis
   set
SO NPJ QUANTUM INFORMATION
AB Quantum computation of the energy of molecules and materials is one of the most promising applications of fault-tolerant quantum computers. Practical applications require development of quantum algorithms with reduced resource requirements. Previous work has mainly focused on quantum algorithms where the Hamiltonian is represented in second quantization with compact basis sets while existing methods in first quantization are limited to a grid-based basis. In this work, we present a new method to solve the generic ground-state chemistry problem in first quantization using any basis set. We achieve asymptotic speedup in Toffoli count for molecular orbitals, and orders of magnitude improvement using dual plane waves as compared to the second quantization counterparts. In some instances, our approach provides similar or even lower resources compared to previous first quantization plane wave algorithms that, unlike our approach, avoids the loading of the classical data. The developed methodology can be applied to variety of applications, where the matrix elements of a first quantized Hamiltonian lack simple circuit representation.

TI Enhancing the Steady-State Entanglement between a
   Laguerre-Gaussian-Cavity Mode and a Rotating Mirror via Cross-Kerr
   Nonlinearity
SO PHOTONICS
AB Quantum entanglement will play an important role in future quantum technologies. Here, we theoretically study the steady-state entanglement between a cavity field and a macroscopic rotating mirror in a Laguerre-Gaussian-(LG)-cavity optomechanical system with cross-Kerr nonlinearity. Logarithmic negativity is used to quantify the steady-state entanglement between the cavity and mechanical modes. We analyze the impacts of the cross-Kerr coupling strength, the cavity detuning, the input laser power, the topological charge of the LG-cavity mode, and the temperature of the environment on the steady-state optomechanical entanglement. We find that cross-Kerr nonlinearity can significantly enhance steady-state optomechanical entanglement and make steady-state optomechanical entanglement more robust against the temperature of the thermal environment.

TI Enhancing coherent energy transfer between quantum devices via a
   mediator
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB We investigate the coherent energy transfer between two quantum systems mediated by a quantum bus. In particular, we consider the energy-transfer process between two qubits and how it can be influenced by using a third qubit or photons in a resonant cavity as mediators. Inspecting different figures of merit and considering both on-and off-resonance configurations, we characterize the energy-transfer performances. We show that while the qubit-mediated transfer shows no advantages with respect to a direct-coupling case, the cavity-mediated one is progressively more and more efficient as function of the number of photons stored in the cavity that acts as a quantum bus. The speeding-up of the energy-transfer time, due to a quantum mediator, paves the way for new architecture designs in quantum technologies and energy-based quantum logics.

TI Quantum information scrambling in molecules
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Out-of-time-order correlators (OTOCs) can be used to probe how quickly a quantum system scrambles information when the initial conditions of the dynamics are changed. In sufficiently large quantum systems, one can extract from the OTOC the quantum analog of the Lyapunov coefficient that describes the timescale on which a classical chaotic system becomes scrambled. OTOCs have been applied only to a very limited number of toy models, such as the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev model connected with black hole information scrambling, but they could find much wider applicability for information scrambling in quantum systems that allow comparison with experiments. The vibrations of polyatomic molecules are known to undergo a transition from regular dynamics at low energy to facile energy flow at sufficiently high energy. Molecules therefore represent ideal quantum systems to study scrambling in many-body systems of moderate size (here 6 to 36 degrees of freedoms). By computing quantum OTOCs and their classical counterparts we quantify how information becomes "scrambled" quantum mechanically in molecular systems. Between early "ballistic" dynamics, and late "saturation" of the OTOC when the full density of states is explored, there is indeed a regime where a quantum Lyapunov coefficient can be defined for all molecules in this study. Comparison with experimental rate data shows that slow scrambling as measured by the OTOC can reach the timescale of molecular reaction dynamics. Even for the smallest molecules we discuss, the Maldacena bound remains satisfied by regularized OTOCs, but not by unregularized OTOCs, highlighting that the former are more useful for discussing information scrambling in this type of moderate-size quantum system.

TI Role of anisotropic confining potential and elliptical driving in
   dynamics of a Ge hole qubit
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICS-CONDENSED MATTER
AB The squeezing of a Ge planar quantum dot enhances the Rabi frequency of electric dipole spin resonance by several orders of magnitude due to a strong Direct Rashba spin-orbit interaction in such geometries (Bosco et al 2021 Phys. Rev. B 104 115425). We investigate the geometric effect of an elliptical (squeezed) confinement and its interplay with the polarization of driving field in determining the Rabi frequency of a heavy-hole qubit in a planar Ge quantum dot. To calculate the Rabi frequency, we consider only the p-linear SOIs viz. electron-like Rashba, hole-like Rashba and hole-like Dresselhaus which are claimed to be the dominant ones by recent studies on planar Ge heterostructures. We derive approximate analytical expressions of the Rabi frequency using a Schrieffer-Wolff transformation for small SOI and driving strengths. Firstly, for an out-of-plane magnetic field with magnitude B, we get an operating region with respect to B, squeezing and polarization parameters where the qubit can be operated to obtain 'clean' Rabi flips. On and close to the boundaries of the region, the higher orbital levels strongly interfere with the two-level qubit subspace and destroy the Rabi oscillations, thereby putting a limitation on squeezing of the confinement. The Rabi frequency shows different behaviour for electron-like and hole-like Rashba SOIs. It vanishes for right (left) circular polarization in presence of purely electron-like (hole-like) Rashba SOI in a circular confinement. For both in- and out-of-plane magnetic fields, higher Rabi frequencies are achieved for squeezed configurations when the ellipses of polarization and the confinement equipotential have their major axes aligned but with different eccentricities. We also deduce a simple formula to calculate the effective heavy hole mass by measuring the Rabi frequencies using this setup.

TI Quantum-secured DSP-lite data transmission architecture for AI-driven
   data centers
SO ADVANCED PHOTONICS
AB Artificial intelligence-driven (AI-driven) data centers, which require high-performance, scalable, energy-efficient, and secure infrastructure, have led to unprecedented data traffic demands. These demands involve low-latency, high-bandwidth connections, low power consumption, and data confidentiality. However, conventional optical interconnect solutions, such as intensity-modulated direct detection and traditional coherent systems, cannot address these requirements simultaneously. In particular, conventional encryption protocols that rely on complex algorithms are increasingly vulnerable to the rapid advancement of quantum computing. We propose and demonstrate a quantum-secured data transmission architecture that involves minimal digital signal processing (DSP) consumption and meets all the stringent requirements for AI-driven data center optical interconnect (AI-DCI) scenarios. By integrating a self-homodyne coherent (SHC) system and quantum key distribution (QKD) through the multicore-fiber-based space division multiplexing (SDM) technology, our scheme enables secure, high-capacity, and energy-efficient data transmission while ensuring resilience against quantum computing threats. In our demonstration, we achieved an expandable transmission capacity of 2 Tbit per second (Tb/s) with a quantum secret key rate (SKR) of 229.2 kb/s and further validated real-time encrypted transmission using AES-256 encryption with QKD-generated keys. Our work paves the way for constructing secure, scalable, and cost-efficient data transmission frameworks, enabling the next generation of intelligent, leak-proof optical interconnects for data centers.

TI Advancing nonlinear dynamics identification with recurrent quantum
   neural networks: Emphasizing Lyapunov stability and adaptive learning in
   system analysis
SO ALEXANDRIA ENGINEERING JOURNAL
AB Identification of nonlinear dynamic systems is a critical task in various fields. Artificial neural networks have been widely used for this purpose due to their ability to approximate complex functions. However, their computational efficiency and stability often pose challenges, especially in real-time applications. Quantum computation has shown potential for enhancing computational performance, but its integration with neural networks is still under investigation. The primary motivation addressed in this paper is the development of an effective strategy for synthesizing and applying recurrent quantum neural networks based on Lyapunov stability criteria (RQNN-LS) for nonlinear system identification. This model enhances the computational efficiency of recurrent neural networks by incorporating quantum computation into the neural network characteristics by using qubit neurons for data processing. Additionally, adaptive learning rates are derived based on Lyapunov stability theory for online tuning of the parameters to guarantee the stability of the proposed technique. The applicability and superiority of the presented RQNN-LS identifier are verified through the simulation and practical results of nonlinear system identification, comparing its performance with other existing identification techniques. The comparative results demonstrated significant improvements in computational efficiency with the proposed technique and highlighted the merits and superiority of the developed model over other methodologies.

TI Criticality-enhanced quantum sensing in ferromagnetic Bose-Einstein
   condensates: Role of readout measurement and detection noise
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB We theoretically investigate estimation of the control parameter in a ferromagnetic Bose-Einstein condensate near second-order quantum phase transitions. We quantify sensitivity by quantum and classical Fisher information and use the error-propagation formula. For these different metrics, we find the same beyond standard quantum limit (SQL) scaling with atom number near critical points and SQL scaling away from critical points. We find that both depletion of the m(f) = 0 Zeeman sublevel and transverse magnetization provide signals of sufficient quality to saturate the sensitivity scaling. To explore the effect of experimental imperfections, we study the scaling around criticality at nonzero temperature and with nonzero detection noise. Our results suggest the feasibility of sub-SQL sensing in ferromagnetic condensates with current experimental capabilities.

AB Designing large-scale superconducting quantum circuits involves complex microwave engineering to minimize loss, spurious reflections, and signal crosstalk. Essential for engineering more complex circuits is precise knowledge of devices' microwave performance, which can be characterized by measuring its calibrated scattering parameters (S-parameters) at mK temperatures. In this work, we introduce a full 2-port calibrated S-parameter measurement setup which can characterize superconducting quantum integrated circuits and other RF integrated circuits operating at mK temperatures. The design and architecture of the measurement system consisting of in-house developed microwave calibration unit (MCU) housing the newly designed cryogenic calibration standards and the device under test (DUT) is discussed in detail. The measurement setup is then used to demonstrate the first calibrated S-parameter measurements of an in-house developed superconducting qubit integrated circuit at mK temperature.

TI Entanglement Dynamics Governed by Time-Dependent Quantum Generators
SO AXIOMS
AB In the article, we investigate entanglement dynamics defined by time-dependent linear generators. We consider multilevel quantum systems coupled to an environment that induces decoherence and dissipation, such that the relaxation rates depend on time. By applying the condition of partial commutativity, one can precisely describe the dynamics of selected subsystems. More specifically, we investigate the dynamics of entangled states. The concurrence is used to quantify the amount of two-qubit entanglement in the time domain. The framework appears to be an efficient tool for investigating quantum evolution of entangled states driven by time-local generators. In particular, non-Markovian effects can be included to observe the restoration of entanglement in time.

TI Effective protocol for generating NOON states of resonator modes
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB We propose a protocol for the generation of NOON states of resonator modes. The physical model is composed of two Kerr -nonlinear resonators and a four -level qudit. Using the off -resonant couplings between the resonators and the qudit, qudit-level-dependent frequency shifts on the two resonators are induced. The frequency shifts allow us to drive different resonators to the N -photon state when the qudit is in different intermediate levels. Consequently, the generation of NOON states with arbitrary photon number N can be completed in only three steps, i.e., driving the qudit to a superposition state of the two intermediate levels, driving one of the resonators to its N -photon state, and driving the qudit back to its ground level. Numerical simulations show that, in the regime of strong Kerr nonlinearity and coupling strengths, the protocol can produce the NOON state with high fidelity in the cases of different photon numbers. In addition, it is possible for the protocol to produce acceptable fidelity in the presence of systematic errors and decoherence factors. Therefore, the protocol may provide some useful perspectives for effective generation of photonic NOON states.

TI Massive quantum superpositions using magnetomechanics
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW APPLIED
AB Macroscopic quantum superpositions of massive objects are very interesting as they have several potential applications, ranging from the exploration of the interaction of gravity with quantum mechanics to quantum sensing. In this article, we propose two related schemes to prepare a spatial superposition of massive quantum oscillator systems with a high Q factor via a superposition of magnetic forces. In the first method, we propose a large spatial superposition of a levitated spherical magnet generated via magnetic forces applied by adjacent flux qubits. We find that in this method the spatial superposition extent Az is independent of the size of the particle. In the second method, we propose a large spatial superposition of a magnetically levitated flux qubit, generated via our driving the levitated qubit inductively. In both schemes, we show that ultralarge superpositions Az/SzZPM similar to 104-106 are possible, where SzZPM is the zero-point motional extent.

TI The discriminative ability on anomaly detection using quantum kernels
   for shipping inspection
SO EPJ QUANTUM TECHNOLOGY
AB We aim to use quantum machine learning to detect various anomalies in image inspection by using small size data. Assuming the possibility that the expressive power of the quantum kernel space is superior to that of the classical kernel space, we are studying a quantum machine learning model. Through trials of image inspection processes not only for factory products but also for products including agricultural products, the importance of trials on real data is recognized. In this study, training was carried out on SVMs embedded with various quantum kernels on a small number of agricultural product image data sets collected in the markets. The quantum kernels prepared in this study consisted of a smaller number of rotating gates and control gates. The F1 scores for each quantum kernel showed a significant effect of using CNOT gates. After confirming the results with a quantum simulator, the usefulness of the quantum kernels was confirmed on a quantum computer. Learning with SVMs embedded with specific quantum kernels showed significantly higher values of the AUC compared to classical kernels. The reason for the lack of learning in quantum kernels is considered to be due to kernel concentration or exponential concentration similar to the Baren plateau. The reason why the F1 score does not increase as the number of features increases is suggested to be due to exponential concentration, while at the same time it is possible that only certain features have discriminative ability. Furthermore, it is suggested that controlled Toffoli gate may be a promising quantum kernel component.

TI Anyonic quantum multipartite maskers in the Kitaev model
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB The structure of quantum mechanics forbids a bipartite scenario for masking quantum information, however, it allows multipartite maskers. The Latin squares are found to be closely related to a series of tripartite maskers. This adds another item, significantly different from the original no -cloning theorem, to the no-go theorems. On the other hand, anyonic excitations in two dimensions exhibit exotic collective behaviors of quantum physics, and open the avenue of fault -tolerant topological quantum computing. Here, we give the Latin -square construction of Abelian and Ising anyons in the Kitaev model and study the maskable space configuration in anyonic space. The circling and braiding of Kitaev anyons are masking operations on extended hyperdisks in anyonic space. We also realize quantum information masking in a teleportation way in the Kitaev Ising anyon model.

TI Shadow hamiltonian simulation
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Simulating quantum dynamics is one of the most important applications of quantum computers. Traditional approaches for quantum simulation involve preparing the full evolved state of the system and then measuring some physical quantity. Here, we present a different and novel approach to quantum simulation that uses a compressed quantum state that we call the "shadow state". The amplitudes of this shadow state are proportional to the time-dependent expectations of a specific set of operators of interest, and it evolves according to its own Schr & ouml;dinger equation. This evolution can be simulated on a quantum computer efficiently under broad conditions. Applications of this approach to quantum simulation problems include simulating the dynamics of exponentially large systems of free fermions or free bosons, the latter example recovering a recent algorithm for simulating exponentially many classical harmonic oscillators. These simulations are hard for classical methods and also for traditional quantum approaches, as preparing the full states would require exponential resources. Shadow Hamiltonian simulation can also be extended to simulate expectations of more complex operators such as two-time correlators or Green's functions, and to study the evolution of operators themselves in the Heisenberg picture.

TI Air Quality and Healthy Ageing: Predictive Modeling of Pollutants Using
   CNN Quantum-LSTM
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB The concept of healthy ageing is emerging and becoming a norm to achieve a high quality of life, reducing healthcare costs and promoting longevity. Rapid growth in global population and urbanisation requires substantial efforts to ensure healthy and supportive environments to improve the quality of life, closely aligned with the principles of healthy ageing. Access to fundamental resources which include quality healthcare services, clean air, green and blue spaces plays a pivotal role in achieving this goal. Air quality, in particular, is a critical factor in achieving healthy ageing targets. However, it necessitates a global effort to develop and implement policies aimed at reducing air pollution, which has severe implications for human health including cognitive impairment and neurodegenerative diseases, while promoting healthier environments such as high quality green and blue spaces for all age groups. Such actions inevitably depend on the current status of air pollution and better predictive models to mitigate the harmful impact of emissions on planetary health and public health. In this work, we proposed a hybrid model referred as AirVCQnet, which combines the variational mode decomposition (VMD) method with a convolutional neural network (CNN) and a quantum long short-term memory (QLSTM) network for the prediction of air pollutants. The performance of the proposed model is analysed on five key pollutants including fine Particulate Matter PM2.5, Nitrogen Dioxide (NO2), Ozone (O-3), PM10, and Sulphur Dioxide (SO2), sourced from air quality monitoring station in Northern Ireland, UK. The effectiveness of the proposed model is evaluated by comparing its performance with its equivalent classical counterpart using root mean square error (RMSE), mean absolute error (MAE), and R-squared (R2). The results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed model, achieving a performance gain of up to 14% and validating its robustness, efficiency and reliability by leveraging the advantages of quantum computation.

TI Quantum Secure Direct Communication with Mutual Authentication using a
   Single Basis
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF THEORETICAL PHYSICS
AB In this paper, we propose a new theoretical scheme for quantum secure direct communication (QSDC) with user authentication. Different from the previous QSDC protocols, the present protocol uses only one orthogonal basis of single-qubit states to encode the secret message. Moreover, this is a one-time and one-way communication protocol, which uses qubits prepared in a randomly chosen arbitrary basis, to transmit the secret message. We discuss the security of the proposed protocol against some common attacks and show that no eavesdropper can get any information from the quantum and classical channels. We have also studied the performance of this protocol under realistic device noise. We have executed the protocol in IBMQ Armonk device and proposed a repetition code based protection scheme that requires minimal overhead.

TI Developing a Chemical and Structural Understanding of the Surface Oxide
   in a Niobium Superconducting Qubit
SO ACS NANO
AB Superconducting thin films of niobium have been extensively employed in transmon qubit architectures. Although these architectures have demonstrated improvements in recent years, further improvements in performance through materials engineering will aid in large-scale deployment. Here, we use information retrieved from secondary ion mass spectrometry and electron microscopy to conduct a detailed assessment of the surface oxide that forms in ambient conditions for transmon test qubit devices patterned from a niobium film. We observe that this oxide exhibits a varying stoichiometry with NbO and NbO2 found closer to the niobium film/oxide interface and Nb2O5 found closer to the surface. In terms of structural analysis, we find that the Nb2O5 region is semicrystalline in nature and exhibits randomly oriented grains on the order of 1-3 nm corresponding to monoclinic N-Nb2O5 that are dispersed throughout an amorphous matrix. Using fluctuation electron microscopy, we are able to map the relative crystallinity in the Nb2O5 region with nanometer spatial resolution. Through this correlative method, we observe that the highly disordered regions are more likely to contain oxygen vacancies and exhibit weaker bonds between the niobium and oxygen atoms. Based on these findings, we expect that oxygen vacancies likely serve as a decoherence mechanism in quantum systems.

TI Study on quantum thermalization from thermal initial states in a
   superconducting quantum computer
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB Quantum thermalization in contemporary quantum devices, in particular quantum computers, has recently attracted significant interest. However, there are few experimental results due to the difficulty in preparing thermal states in quantum systems. In this paper, we propose a protocol to indirectly address this challenge using only pure states. While our protocol does not solve the issue of thermal state preparation, it enables the equivalent study of their dynamics. Moreover, we experimentally validate our protocol using IBM quantum devices, presenting results that demonstrate unusual relaxation in equidistant quenches. We also assess the formalism introduced for the Quantum Mpemba Effect (QME), which provides a framework for comparing the dynamics of different thermal states, we do no observe any unusual behaviour in this case, which is consistent with the theoretical predictions for the system. This demonstration underscores that our protocol can provide an alternative way of studying thermal states physics when their direct preparation may be too difficult.

TI Partitioning dysprosium's electronic spin to reveal entanglement in
   nonclassical states
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Quantum spins of mesoscopic size are a well-studied playground for engineering nonclassical states. If the spin represents the collective state of an ensemble of qubits, its nonclassical behavior is linked to entanglement between the qubits. In this paper, we report on an experimental study of entanglement between two subsystems of dysprosium's electronic spin. Its ground state, of angular momentum J = 8, can formally be viewed as a set of 2J qubits symmetric upon exchange. To access entanglement properties, we partition the spin by optically coupling it to an excited state J' = J - 1, which removes a pair of qubits in a state defined by the light polarization. Starting with the well-known W and squeezed states, we extract the concurrence of qubit pairs, which quantifies their nonclassical character. We also directly demonstrate entanglement between the 14- and 2-qubit subsystems via an increase in entropy upon partition. In a complementary set of experiments, we probe decoherence of a state prepared in the excited level J' = J + 1 and interpret spontaneous emission as a loss of a qubit pair in a random state. This allows us to contrast the robustness of nonclassical pairwise correlations of the W state with the fragility of the coherence involved in a Schrodinger cat state. Our findings open up the possibility to engineer novel types of entangled atomic ensembles, in which entanglement occurs within each atom's electronic spin as well as between different atoms. Qubit ensembles with large entanglement depth could then be realized with a few atoms only, facilitating the scaling up of quantum-enhanced sensors.

TI Subspace Methods for the Simulation of Molecular Response Properties on
   a Quantum Computer
SO JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL THEORY AND COMPUTATION
AB We explore Davidson methods for obtaining excitation energies and other linear response properties within the recently developed quantum self-consistent linear response (q-sc-LR) method. Davidson-type methods allow for obtaining only a few selected excitation energies without explicitly constructing the electronic Hessian since they only require the ability to perform Hessian-vector multiplications. We apply the Davidson method to calculate the excitation energies of hydrogen chains (up to H-10) and analyze aspects of statistical noise for computing excitation energies on quantum simulators. Additionally, we apply Davidson methods for computing linear response properties such as static polarizabilities for H-2, LiH, H2O, OH-, and NH3, and show that unitary coupled cluster outperforms classical projected coupled cluster for molecular systems with strong correlation. Finally, we formulate the Davidson method for damped (complex) linear response, with application to the nitrogen K-edge X-ray absorption of ammonia, and the C-6 coefficients of H-2, LiH, H2O, OH-, and NH3.

TI Optimized SWAP networks with equivalent circuit averaging for QAOA
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB The SWAP network is a qubit routing sequence that can be used to efficiently execute the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA). Even with a minimally connected topology on an n-qubit processor, this routing sequence enables O(n(2)) operations to execute in O(n) steps. In this work, we optimize the execution of SWAP networks for QAOA through two techniques. First, we take advantage of an overcomplete set of native hardware operations [including 150-ns controlled-pi/2 phase gates with up to 99.67(1)% fidelity] to decompose the relevant quantum gates and SWAP networks in a manner which minimizes circuit depth and maximizes gate cancellation. Second, we introduce equivalent circuit averaging, which randomizes over degrees of freedom in the quantum circuit compilation to reduce the impact of systematic coherent errors. Our techniques are experimentally validated at the Advanced Quantum Testbed through the execution of QAOA circuits for finding the ground state of two- and four-node Sherrington-Kirkpatrick spin-glass models with various randomly sampled parameters. We observe a similar to 60% average reduction in error (total variation distance) for QAOA of depth p = 1 on four transmon qubits on a superconducting quantum processor.

TI Dynamics of a quantum Cournot-Bertrand duopoly model based on bounded
   rationality and product substitutability
SO QUANTUM INFORMATION PROCESSING
AB The development of quantum information theory based on quantum entangled states is advancing rapidly and has promoted the emergence of quantum game theory. Quantum game theory is quantum information processing applied to classical games, which solves problems that classical games cannot solve. This paper explores the quantum Cournot-Bertrand game model of two firms in a duopoly market with bounded rationality and product substitutability. The first and second firms choose production output and sales price as their decision variables, respectively. We first define the quantum Cournot-Bertrand dynamical system and study the existence and locally stable conditions of equilibrium points. Then we explore bifurcation conditions and bifurcation types. Finally, we do the bifurcation analysis and explore the impacts of the model parameters as the potential market size of products, the two firms' linear marginal cost, the players' speed of strategy adjustment, the product substitution index, and the quantum entanglement degree on the Nash equilibrium stability and bifurcation using numerical analysis and simulation, and provide economic explanations for the results.

TI The verification of a requirement of entanglement measures
SO QUANTUM INFORMATION PROCESSING
AB The quantification of quantum entanglement is a difficult and fundamental question in quantum information theory. We devote to the refinement of axiomatic approach of quantifying entanglement. Recently, Gao et al. (Phys Rev Lett 112:180501, 2014) pointed out that the maximum of entanglement measure of the permutational invariant part rho PI of a state rho ought to be a lower bound on entanglement measure of the original state rho. They further argued to add this result as requirement on any (multipartite) entanglement measure. Whether any individual proposed entanglement measure satisfies the new requirement still has to be proved. In this paper, we show that most existing entanglement measures of bipartite quantum systems satisfy the new criterion, including all convex-roof entanglement measures, the relative entropy of entanglement, the negativity, the logarithmic negativity and the logarithmic convex-roof extended negativity. Our approach gives a refinement in quantifying entanglement and provides new insights on better understanding of entanglement properties of composite quantum systems.

TI Scalable set of reversible parity gates for integer factorization
SO COMMUNICATIONS PHYSICS
AB Classical microprocessors operate on irreversible gates, that, when combined with AND, half-adder and full-adder operations, execute complex tasks such as multiplication of integers. We introduce parity versions of all components of a multiplication circuit. The parity gates are reversible quantum gates based on the recently introduced parity transformation and build on ground-space encoding of the corresponding gate logic. Using a quantum optimization heuristic, e.g., an adiabatic quantum computing protocol, allows one to quantum mechanically reverse the process of multiplication and thus factor integers, which has applications in cryptography. Our parity approach builds on nearest-neighbor constraints equipped with local fields, able to encode the logic of a binary multiplication circuit in a modular and scalable way.
   The authors present a method of prime factorization using quantum logic, based on parity-based gates. Using this approach, they formulate factorization as an optimization problem and show a quadratic advantage in the number of qubits required over other standard representations.

TI Dynamic entanglement for continuous variables in an electric field
   background
SO COMMUNICATIONS IN THEORETICAL PHYSICS
AB Quantum entanglement is a typical nonclassical correlation. Here, we use this concept to analyze quantum entanglement for continuous variables generated by the Schwinger pair production for constant and pulsed electric fields. An initial two-mode entangled state evolves into a three-mode entangled state through a Gaussian channel of the Schwinger effect, which encodes the information about the Schwinger effect. By detecting the entanglement of the output three-mode state, we obtain the optimal parameters for easier to generate particle-antiparticle pairs. We find that the generated 1 -> 2 entanglement is more sensitive to the parameters than the generated 1 -> 1 entanglement. Therefore, we should choose the generated 1 -> 2 entanglement to extract information. We argue that extracting the optimal parameters from quantum entanglement may guide future experiments.

TI Mode hitching in traveling-wave optical parametric amplification
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Optical parametric amplifiers (OPAs) in traveling-wave configuration can generate localized spatial quantum correlations between a signal and an idler beam, a useful resource for quantum imaging. To characterize the spatial correspondence between the optical modes of the signal and those of the idler, we look at the classical transverse dynamics of these beams when they propagate in a generic thick OPA at a nominally small angle. In these conditions, the beams tend to copropagate while maintaining a fixed separation, a phenomenon that we term hitching. We develop a model for hitching, validated by a numerical simulation, and provide an experimental demonstration using four-wave mixing in a hot atomic vapor. They show that the OPA gain is the primary influence on the final hitching distance. These results have implications for the generation of multi-spatial-mode squeezed light for quantum imaging applications, where the exact spatial correlations between the quantum fluctuations of the signal and the idler are of prime importance.

TI Optimal coupling of HoW10 molecular magnets to superconducting circuits
   near spin clock transitions
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW APPLIED
AB A central goal in quantum technologies is to maximize GT2 , where G stands for the coupling of a qubit to control and readout signals and T2 is the qubit's coherence time. This is challenging, as increasing G (e.g., by coupling the qubit more strongly to external stimuli) often leads to deleterious effects on T2. Here, we study the coupling of pure and magnetically diluted crystals of HoW10 magnetic clusters to microwave superconducting coplanar waveguides. Absorption lines give a broadband picture of the magnetic energy level scheme and, in particular, confirm the existence of level anticrossings at equidistant magnetic fields determined by the combination of crystal field and hyperfine interactions. Such "spin clock transitions" are known to shield the electronic spins against magnetic field fluctuations. The analysis of the microwave transmission shows that the spin-photon coupling also becomes maximum at these transitions. The results show that engineering spin-clock states of molecular systems offers a promising strategy to combine sizable spin-photon interactions with a sufficient isolation from unwanted magnetic noise sources.

TI Photonic indistinguishability characterization and optimization for
   cavity-based single-photon source
SO MACHINE LEARNING-SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB Indistinguishability of single photons from independent sources is critically important for scalable quantum technologies. We provide a comprehensive comparison of single-photon indistinguishability of different kinds of cavity quantum electrodynamics (CQEDs) systems by numerically simulating Hong-Ou-Mandel two-photon interference. We find that the CQED system using natural atoms exhibits superiority in indistinguishability, benefiting from the inherently identical features. Moreover, a Lambda-type three-level atom shows essential robustness against variation of various system parameters because it exploits the two ground states with considerably smaller decay rates for single-photon generation. Furthermore, a machine learning-based framework is proposed to significantly and robustly improve single-photon indistinguishability for two non-identical CQED systems. This work may pave the way for designing and engineering reliable and scalable photon-based quantum technologies.

TI A General Approach to Dropout in Quantum Neural Networks
SO ADVANCED QUANTUM TECHNOLOGIES
AB In classical machine learning (ML), "overfitting" is the phenomenon occurring when a given model learns the training data excessively well, and it thus performs poorly on unseen data. A commonly employed technique in ML is the so called "dropout," which prevents computational units from becoming too specialized, hence reducing the risk of overfitting. With the advent of quantum neural networks (QNNs) as learning models, overfitting might soon become an issue, owing to the increasing depth of quantum circuits as well as multiple embedding of classical features, which are employed to give the computational nonlinearity. Here, a generalized approach is presented to apply the dropout technique in QNN models, defining and analyzing different quantum dropout strategies to avoid overfitting and achieve a high level of generalization. This study allows to envision the power of quantum dropout in enabling generalization, providing useful guidelines on determining the maximal dropout probability for a given model, based on overparametrization theory. It also highlights how quantum dropout does not impact the features of the QNN models, such as expressibility and entanglement. All these conclusions are supported by extensive numerical simulations and may pave the way to efficiently employing deep quantum machine learning (QML) models based on state-of-the-art QNNs.
   Randomly dropping artificial neurons and all their connections in the training phase reduces overfitting issues in classical neural networks, thus improving performances on previously unseen data. The authors introduce different dropout strategies applied to quantum neural networks, learning models based on parametrized quantum circuits. Quantum dropout strategies might help reducing overfitting without impacting the expressibility and entanglement of these models.image

TI Phase-engineered bosonic quantum codes
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Continuous-variable systems protected by bosonic quantum codes have emerged as a promising platform for quantum information. To date, the design of code words has centered on optimizing the state occupation in the relevant basis to generate the distance needed for error correction. Here, we show tuning the phase degree of freedom in the design of code words can affect, and potentially enhance, the protection against Markovian errors that involve excitation exchange with the environment. As illustrations, we first consider phase engineering bosonic codes with uniform spacing in the Fock basis that correct excitation loss with a Kerr unitary and show that these modified codes feature destructive interference between error code words and, with an adapted "two-level" recovery, the error protection is significantly enhanced. We then study protection against energy decay with the presence of mode nonlinearities and analyze the role of phase for optimal code designs. We extend the principle of phase engineering to bosonic codes defined in other bases and multiqubit codes, demonstrating its broad applicability in quantum error correction.

SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB The scalability of quantum networking will benefit from quantum and classical communications coexisting in shared fibers, the main challenge being spontaneous Raman scattering noise. We investigate the coexistence of multi-channel O-band quantum and C-band classical communications. We characterize multiple narrowband entangled photon pair channels across 1282 nm-1318 nm co-propagating over 48 km of installed standard fiber with record C-band power (>18 dBm) and demonstrate that some quantum-classical wavelength combinations significantly outperform others. We analyze the Raman noise spectrum, optimal wavelength engineering, multi-photon pair emission in entangled photon-classical coexistence, and evaluate the implications for future quantum applications.

TI A Bayesian-network-based quantum procedure for failure risk analysis

In this paper, we propose a procedure for creating a model of the system on a quantum computer using a restricted representation of Bayesian networks. We present examples of this implementation on sample models using Qiskit and test them using both quantum simulators and IBM Quantum hardware. The results show a correlation in the precision of the results when considering the number of Monte Carlo iterations alongside the sum of shots in a single quantum circuit execution.

TI Fermionic quantum processing with programmable neutral atom arrays
SO PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF
   AMERICA
AB Simulating the properties of many-body fermionic systems is an outstanding com-putational challenge relevant to material science, quantum chemistry, and particle physics. Although qubit-based quantum computers can potentially tackle this problem more efficiently than classical devices, encoding nonlocal fermionic statistics introduces an overhead in the required resources, limiting their applicability on near-term architectures. In this work, we present a fermionic quantum processor, where fermionic models are locally encoded in a fermionic register and simulated in a hardware -efficient manner using fermionic gates. We consider in particular fermionic atoms in programmable tweezer arrays and develop different protocols to implement nonlocal gates, guaranteeing Fermi statistics at the hardware level. We use this gate set, together with Rydberg-mediated interaction gates, to find efficient circuit decompositions for digital and variational quantum simulation algorithms, illustrated here for molecular energy estimation. Finally, we consider a combined fermion-qubit architecture, where both the motional and internal degrees of freedom of the atoms are harnessed to efficiently implement quantum phase estimation as well as to simulate lattice gauge theory dynamics.

TI A Race-Track Trapped-Ion Quantum Processor
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW X
AB We describe and benchmark a new quantum charge-coupled device (QCCD) trapped-ion quantum computer based on a linear trap with periodic boundary conditions, which resembles a race track. The new system successfully incorporates several technologies crucial to future scalability-including electrode broadcasting, multilayer rf routing, and magneto-optical trap (MOT) loading-while maintaining, and in some cases exceeding, the gate fidelities of previous QCCD systems. The system is initially operated with 32 qubits, but future upgrades will allow for more. We benchmark the performance of primitive operations, including an average state preparation and measurement error of 1.6(1) x 10(-3), an average single-qubit gate infidelity of 2.5(3) x 10(-5), and an average two-qubit gate infidelity of 1.84(5) x 10(-3). The systemlevel performance of the quantum processor is assessed with mirror benchmarking, linear cross-entropy benchmarking, a quantum volume measurement of QV = 2(16), and the creation of 32-qubit entanglement in a GHZ state. We also tested application benchmarks, including Hamiltonian simulation, QAOA, error correction on a repetition code, and dynamics simulations using qubit reuse. We also discuss future upgrades to the new system aimed at adding more qubits and capabilities.

TI Quantum Binary Field Multiplication with Optimized Toffoli Depth and
   Extension to Quantum Inversion
SO SENSORS
AB The Shor's algorithm can find solutions to the discrete logarithm problem on binary elliptic curves in polynomial time. A major challenge in implementing Shor's algorithm is the overhead of representing and performing arithmetic on binary elliptic curves using quantum circuits. Multiplication of binary fields is one of the critical operations in the context of elliptic curve arithmetic, and it is especially costly in the quantum setting. Our goal in this paper is to optimize quantum multiplication in the binary field. In the past, efforts to optimize quantum multiplication have centred on reducing the Toffoli gate count or qubits required. However, despite the fact that circuit depth is an important metric for indicating the performance of a quantum circuit, previous studies have lacked sufficient consideration for reducing circuit depth. Our approach to optimizing quantum multiplication differs from previous work in that we aim at reducing the Toffoli depth and full depth. To optimize quantum multiplication, we adopt the Karatsuba multiplication method which is based on the divide-and-conquer approach. In summary, we present an optimized quantum multiplication that has a Toffoli depth of one. Additionally, the full depth of the quantum circuit is also reduced thanks to our Toffoli depth optimization strategy. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method, we evaluate its performance using various metrics such as the qubit count, quantum gates, and circuit depth, as well as the qubits-depth product. These metrics provide insight into the resource requirements and complexity of the method. Our work achieves the lowest Toffoli depth, full depth, and the best trade-off performance for quantum multiplication. Further, our multiplication is more effective when not used in stand-alone cases. We show this effectiveness by using our multiplication to the Itoh-Tsujii algorithm-based inversion of F(x(8)+x(4)+x(3)+x+1).

TI Finite Speed of Quantum Information in Models of Interacting Bosons at
   Finite Density
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW X
AB We prove that quantum information propagates with a finite velocity in any model of interacting bosons whose (possibly time-dependent) Hamiltonian contains spatially local single-boson hopping terms along with arbitrary local density-dependent interactions. More precisely, with the density matrix ?? ??? exp[?????N] (with N the total boson number), ensemble-averaged correlators of the form ([A0, Br(t)]), along with outof-time-ordered correlators, must vanish as the distance r between two local operators grows, unless t ??? r/v for some finite speed v. In one-dimensional models, we give a useful extension of this result that demonstrates the smallness of all matrix elements of the commutator [A0, Br(t)] between finite-density states if t/r is sufficiently small. Our bounds are relevant for physically realistic initial conditions in experimentally realized models of interacting bosons. In particular, we prove that v can scale no faster than linear in number density in the Bose-Hubbard model: This scaling matches previous results in the highdensity limit. The quantum-walk formalism underlying our proof provides an alternative method for bounding quantum dynamics in models with unbounded operators and infinite-dimensional Hilbert spaces, where Lieb-Robinson bounds have been notoriously challenging to prove.

SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
AB Decoherence and relaxation of solid-state defect qutrits near a crystal surface, where they are commonly used as quantum sensors, originate from charge and magnetic field noise. A complete theory requires a formalism for decoherence and relaxation that includes all Hamiltonian terms allowed by the defect's point-group symmetry. This formalism, presented here for the C 3 ,, symmetry of a spin-1 defect in a diamond, silicon carbide, or similar host, relies on a Lindblad dynamical equation and clarifies the relative contributions of charge and spin noise to relaxation and decoherence, along with their dependence on the defect spin's depth and resonant frequencies. The calculations agree with the experimental measurements of Sangtawesin et al. [Phys. Rev. X 9 , 031052 (2019)], and corroborate the importance of charge noise.

TI Optimizing quantum transformation matrices: Block decomposition approach
   for efficient gate reduction
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB This paper introduces an algorithm designed to approximate quantum transformation matrix with a restricted number of gates by using the block decomposition technique. Addressing challenges posed by numerous gates in handling large qubit transformations, the algorithm provides a solution by optimizing gate usage while maintaining computational accuracy. Inspired by the block decompose algorithm, our approach processes transformation matrices in a blockwise manner, enabling users to specify the desired gate count for flexibility in resource allocation. Simulations validate the effectiveness of the algorithm in approximating transformations with significantly fewer gates, enhancing quantum computing efficiency for complex calculations.

TI Device-independent secret key rates via a postselected Bell inequality
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB In device-independent quantum key distribution (DIQKD) the security is not based on any assumptions about the intrinsic properties of the devices and the quantum signals but on the violation of a Bell inequality. We introduce a DIQKD scenario in which an optimal Bell inequality is constructed from the performed measurement data rather than fixing beforehand a specific Bell inequality. Our method can be employed in a general way, for any number of measurement settings and any number of outcomes. We provide an implementable DIQKD protocol and perform finite-size security key analysis for collective attacks. We compare our approach with related procedures in the literature and analyze the robustness of our protocol. We also study the performance of our method in several Bell scenarios as well as for random measurement settings.

TI Broadband phonon to magnon conversion in yttrium iron garnet
SO MATERIALS FOR QUANTUM TECHNOLOGY
AB We propose and experimentally demonstrate a means of broadband phonon-magnon interconversion that relies on combining magnetoelastic coupling with translational symmetry breaking in the important experimental material yttrium iron garnet (YIG). As well as being of interest for its basic physics, this quasiparticle coupling mechanism adds to the range of effects that potentially find useful application in hybrid solid-state quantum computing devices as well as low-power wave-based classical computing architectures.

TI Advancing generative AI for music with photonics
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PARALLEL EMERGENT AND DISTRIBUTED SYSTEMS
AB This paper presents PhotoSing, a system that learns to generate polyphonic tunes by extracting sequencing rules from given examples. We developed a method to encode given pieces of music in terms of unique musical events, referred to as UMEs, and stochastic rules for sequencing them. Those rules are subsequently converted into representations to be processed by a photonic computer to generate new compositions. This research builds upon a previous system, QuSing, which generated monophonic tunes with superconducting quantum computing. The paper discusses the pitfalls of the previous system, the research and the solutions developed to improve them. It details the system with demonstrative musical examples and analyses.

TI Interaction-driven breakdown of dynamical localization in a kicked
   quantum gas
SO NATURE PHYSICS
AB Quantum interference can limit energy absorption in a continually kicked system through a single-particle ergodicity-breaking mechanism known as dynamical localization(1,2). The effect of many-body interactions on dynamically localized states, although important to a fundamental understanding of quantum decoherence, has remained unexplored despite more than two decades of experimental studies(3-5). Here we report the experimental realization of a kicked quantum rotor ensemble with tunable interactions using a Bose-Einstein condensate in a pulsed optical lattice. We observe a clear breakdown of dynamical localization due to interactions, but the resulting dynamics do not restore classical chaotic behaviour, instead displaying sublinear anomalous diffusion. Moreover, echo-type time-reversal experiments establish the role of interactions in destroying reversibility. These results quantitatively elucidate the dynamical transition to many-body quantum chaos and advance our understanding of quantum anomalous diffusion, with implications on the protection of quantum information in interacting driven systems.

TI Simultaneous Preparation of Two Optical Cat States Based on a
   Nondegenerate Optical Parametric Amplifier
SO ANNALEN DER PHYSIK
AB The cat state, known as the superposition of coherent states, has broad applications in quantum computation and quantum metrology. Increasing the number of optical cat states is crucial to implement complex quantum information tasks based on them. Here, two optical cat states are prepared simultaneously based on a nondegenerate optical parametric amplifier. By subtracting one photon from each of two squeezed vacuum states, two odd cat states with orthogonal superposition direction in phase space are prepared simultaneously, which have similar fidelity of 60% and amplitude of 1.2. Compared with the traditional method to generate two odd optical cat states based on two degenerate optical parametric amplifiers, only one nondegenerate optical parametric amplifier is applied in this experiment, which saves half of the quantum resources of nonlinear cavities. The presented results make a step toward preparing the four-component cat state, which has potential applications in fault-tolerant quantum computation.

TI Spacetime symmetric qubit regularization of the asymptotically free
   two-dimensional O(4) model
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW D
AB We explore if spacetime symmetric lattice field theory models with a finite Hilbert space per lattice site can reproduce asymptotic freedom in the two-dimensional O(4) model. We focus on a simple class of such models with a five-dimensional local Hilbert space. We demonstrate how even the simplest model reproduces asymptotic freedom within the D-theory formalism but at the cost of increasing the size of the Hilbert space through coupling several layers of a two-dimensional lattice. We then argue that qubit regularization can be viewed as an effective field theory (EFT) even if the continuum limit cannot be reached, as long as we can tune the model close enough to the continuum limit where perturbation theory, or other analytical techniques, become viable. We construct a simple lattice model on a single layer with a four-dimensional local Hilbert space that acts like an excellent EFT of the original theory.

AB Satellite based quantum key distribution (QKD) enables the delivery of keys for quantum secure communications over long distances. Maturity of the technology as well as industrial interest are ever increasing. Same is true for satellite free-space optical communications (FSOC). In order to enable a robust channel for transmission it is indispensable to account for static and dynamically changing misalignments between the transmitter and receiver pair. This work will focus on the transmitter terminal (Alice) and the design and verification process of the active beam steering system. The novelty is a recently developed variable reluctance fine steering mirror (FSM) including eddy current sensors (ECS) to measure its tip and tilt. A cascaded architecture was chosen in order to combine the optical stabilization objective with the dynamics of the mirror platform. The inner control loop makes use of an observer model whose estimated output is fed into a state controller allowing for an increased responsiveness. While high gains increase the closed loop bandwidth the eigenfrequency of the system introduces a pole to the plant which has to be avoided by the controller output. A digital notch filter was introduced to reject the excitation of the critical frequency band which gets obsolete in a system with high frequency sampling capabilities. The outer loop is engaged when a valid optical signal is received and a transition from a closed loop pointing to a closed loop tracking mode is performed. A proportional-integral (PI) controller keeps the received beam at the 4-quadrant-diode (4QD) whose center is used as the main reference through prior calibration with the transmit beam launching on the same path. The presented cascaded control scheme allows improvements in system performance and reliability.

TI The Fuzzy Bit
SO SYMMETRY-BASEL
AB In this paper, the formulation of Quantum Mechanics in terms of fuzzy logic and fuzzy sets is explored. A result by Pykacz, which establishes a correspondence between (quantum) logics (lattices with certain properties) and certain families of fuzzy sets, is applied to the Birkhoff-von Neumann logic, the lattice of projectors of a Hilbert space. Three cases are considered: the qubit, two qubits entangled, and a qutrit 'nested' inside the two entangled qubits. The membership functions of the fuzzy sets are explicitly computed and all the connectives of the fuzzy sets are interpreted as operations with these particular membership functions. In this way, a complete picture of the standard quantum logic in terms of fuzzy sets is obtained for the systems considered.

TI Thermodynamically optimal protocols for dual-purpose qubit operations
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Information processing, quantum or classical, relies on channels transforming multiple input states to different corresponding outputs. Previous research has established bounds on the thermodynamic resources required for such operations, but no protocols have been specified for their optimal implementation. For the insightful case of qubits, we here develop explicit protocols to transform two states in an energetically optimal manner. We first prove conditions on the feasibility of carrying out such transformations at all, and then quantify the achievable work extraction. Our results uncover a fundamental incompatibility between the thermodynamic ideal of slow, quasistatic processes and the information-theoretic requirement to preserve distinguishability between different possible output states.

TI Unitary coupled-cluster for quantum computation of molecular properties
   in a strong magnetic field
SO JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL PHYSICS
AB In truncated coupled-cluster (CC) theories, non-variational and/or generally complex ground-state energies can occur. This is due to the non-Hermitian nature of the similarity transformed Hamiltonian matrix in combination with CC truncation. For chemical problems that deal with real-valued Hamiltonian matrices, complex CC energies rarely occur. However, for complex-valued Hamiltonian matrices, such as those that arise in the presence of strong magnetic fields, complex CC energies can be regularly observed unless certain symmetry conditions are fulfilled. Therefore, in the presence of magnetic fields, it is desirable to pursue CC methods that are guaranteed to give upper-bound, real-valued energies. In this work, we present the first application of unitary CC to chemical systems in a strong magnetic field. This is achieved utilizing the variational quantum eigensolver algorithm applied to the unitary coupled-cluster singles and doubles (UCCSD) method. We benchmark the method on the H-2 molecule in a strong magnetic field and then calculate UCCSD energies for the H-4 molecule as a function of both geometry and field angle. We show that while standard CCSD can yield generally complex energies that are not an upper-bound to the true energy, UCCSD always results in variational and real-valued energies. We also show that the imaginary components of the CCSD energy are largest in the strongly correlated region. Last, the UCCSD calculations capture a large percentage of the correlation energy.

TI Non-Gaussian Mechanical Motion via Single and Multiphonon Subtraction
   from a Thermal State
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB Quantum optical measurement techniques offer a rich avenue for quantum control of mechanical oscillators via cavity optomechanics. In particular, a powerful yet little explored combination utilizes optical measurements to perform heralded non-Gaussian mechanical state preparation followed by tomography to determine the mechanical phase-space distribution. Here, we experimentally perform heralded single-phonon and multiphonon subtraction via photon counting to a laser-cooled mechanical thermal state with a Brillouin optomechanical system at room temperature and use optical heterodyne detection to measure the s-parametrized Wigner distribution of the non-Gaussian mechanical states generated. The techniques developed here advance the state of the art for optics-based tomography of mechanical states and will be useful for a broad range of applied and fundamental studies that utilize mechanical quantum-state engineering and tomography.
