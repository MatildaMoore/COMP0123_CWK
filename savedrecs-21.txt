TI Progress Toward Detection of Individual TLS in Nanomechanical Resonators
SO JOURNAL OF LOW TEMPERATURE PHYSICS
AB The low-temperature properties of amorphous solids are usually explained in terms of atomic-scale tunneling two level systems (TLS). For almost 20 years, individual TLS have been probed in insulating layers of superconducting quantum circuits. Detecting individual TLS in mechanical systems has been proposed but not definitively demonstrated. We describe an optomechanical system that is appropriate for this goal and describe our progress toward achieving it. In particular, we show that the expected coupling between the mechanical mode and a resonant TLS is strong enough for high visibility of a TLS given the linewidth of the mechanical mode. Furthermore, the electronic noise level of our measurement system is low enough, and the anomalous force noise observed in other nanomechanical devices is absent.

TI Quantum error mitigation for Fourier moment computation
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW D
AB Hamiltonian moments in Fourier space-expectation values of the unitary evolution operator under a Hamiltonian at different times-provide a convenient framework to understand quantum systems. They offer insights into the energy distribution, higher-order dynamics, response functions, correlation information, and physical properties. This paper focuses on the computation of Fourier moments within the context of a nuclear effective field theory on superconducting quantum hardware. The study integrates echo verification and noise renormalization into Hadamard tests using control reversal gates. These techniques, combined with purification and error suppression methods, effectively address quantum hardware decoherence. The analysis, conducted using noise models, reveals a significant reduction in noise strength by two orders of magnitude. Moreover, quantum circuits involving up to 266 CNOT gates over five qubits demonstrate high accuracy under these methodologies when run on IBM superconducting quantum devices.

TI Cross-architecture tuning of silicon and SiGe-based quantum devices
   using machine learning
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB The potential of Si and SiGe-based devices for the scaling of quantum circuits is tainted by device variability. Each device needs to be tuned to operation conditions and each device realisation requires a different tuning protocol. We demonstrate that it is possible to automate the tuning of a 4-gate Si FinFET, a 5-gate GeSi nanowire and a 7-gate Ge/SiGe heterostructure double quantum dot device from scratch with the same algorithm. We achieve tuning times of 30, 10, and 92 min, respectively. The algorithm also provides insight into the parameter space landscape for each of these devices, allowing for the characterization of the regions where double quantum dot regimes are found. These results show that overarching solutions for the tuning of quantum devices are enabled by machine learning.

TI Resonant Oscillations of Josephson Current in
   Nb-Bi2Te2.3Se0.7-Nb Junctions
SO ADVANCED QUANTUM TECHNOLOGIES
AB Josephson proximity junctions and devices employing topological insulators are promising candidates for realizing topological superconductivity and topologically protected quantum circuits. Here, the new type of oscillations of the critical Josephson current in the ballistic Nb-Bi2Te2.3Se0.7-Nb junctions subject to the magnetic fields is reported. The oscillations appear below approximate to 400 mK and have a very unusual sharp-peaked shape. Their ultra-short period approximate to 1 Oe, by orders of magnitude shorter than the expected periodicity due to fluxoid quantization in the device, corresponds to the extremely low energy scale approximate to 1 mu$\umu$eV. It is established that the observed effect is due to the resonant transmission of Andreev quasiparticles via the peculiar energy levels forming near the S-TI interfaces.

TI A Fast Quantum Image Component Labeling Algorithm
SO MATHEMATICS
AB Component Labeling, as a fundamental preprocessing task in image understanding and pattern recognition, is an indispensable task in digital image processing. It has been proved that it is one of the most time-consuming tasks within pattern recognition. In this paper, a fast quantum image component labeling algorithm is proposed, which is the quantum counterpart of classical local-operator technique. A binary image is represented by the modified novel enhanced quantum image representation (NEQR) and a quantum parallel-shrink operator and quantum propagate operator are executed in succession, to finally obtain the component label. The time complexity of the proposed quantum image component labeling algorithm is O(n(2)), and the spatial complexity of the quantum circuits designed is O(cn) . Simulation verifies the correctness of results.

TI On the Degenerate Entanglement-Assisted Free-Space Optical Communication
   With SLM-Based Beam Steering Using Dual-Pump Lasers
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB We propose a degenerate entanglement-assisted (EA) free-space optical (FSO) communication system employing spatial light modulator (SLM)-based beam steering and a novel dual-pump configuration. The system utilizes a type-0 periodically poled lithium niobate (PPLN) waveguide to generate signal and idler photon pairs at 1570 nm, using two independent low-cost C- and L-band pump lasers. To enable homodyne detection, unmodulated idler photons are transmitted alongside modulated signal photons thus avoiding the need for phase conjugation and quantum memories. We demonstrate 1 Gb/s degenerate entanglement assisted transmission over a 1.5 km terrestrial FSO link at the University of Arizona campus, operating in the L-band. Experimental results show that the proposed degenerate EA system significantly outperforms its classical counterpart, particularly under strong atmospheric turbulence conditions.

TI Enhanced Photocurrent and Electrically Pumped Quantum Dot Emission from
   Single Plasmonic Nanoantennas
SO ACS NANO
AB Integrating cavity-enhanced colloidal quantum dots (QDs) into photonic chip devices would be transformative for advancing room-temperature optoelectronic and quantum photonic technologies. However, issues with efficiency, stability, and cost remain formidable challenges to reach the single antenna limit. Here, we present a bottom-up approach that delivers single QD-plasmonic nanoantennas with electrical addressability. These QD nanojunctions exhibit robust photoresponse characteristics, with plasmonically enhanced photocurrent spectra matching the QD solution absorption. We demonstrate electroluminescence from individual plasmonic nanoantennas, extending the device lifetime beyond 40 min by utilizing a 3 nm electron-blocking polymer layer. In addition, we reveal a giant voltage-dependent redshift of up to 62 meV due to the quantum-confined Stark effect and determine the exciton polarizability of the CdSe QD monolayer to be 4 x 10(-5) meV/(kV/cm)(2). These developments provide a foundation for accessing scalable quantum light sources and high-speed, tunable optoelectronic systems operating under ambient conditions.

TI AEDGE: Atomic experiment for dark matter and gravity exploration in
   space
SO EXPERIMENTAL ASTRONOMY
AB This article contains a summary of the White Paper submitted in 2019 to the ESA Voyage 2050 process, which was subsequently published in EPJ Quantum Technology (AEDGE Collaboration et al. EPJ Quant. Technol. 7,6 2020). We propose in this White Paper a concept for a space experiment using cold atoms to search for ultra-light dark matter, and to detect gravitational waves in the frequency range between the most sensitive ranges of LISA and the terrestrial LIGO/Virgo/KAGRA/INDIGO experiments. This interdisciplinary experiment, called Atomic Experiment for Dark Matter and Gravity Exploration (AEDGE), will also complement other planned searches for dark matter, and exploit synergies with other gravitational wave detectors. We give examples of the extended range of sensitivity to ultra-light dark matter offered by AEDGE, and how its gravitational-wave measurements could explore the assembly of super-massive black holes, first-order phase transitions in the early universe and cosmic strings. AEDGE will be based upon technologies now being developed for terrestrial experiments using cold atoms, and will benefit from the space experience obtained with, e.g., LISA and cold atom experiments in microgravity.

TI Probing the dynamics and coherence of a semiconductor hole spin via
   acoustic phonon-assisted excitation
SO QUANTUM SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB Spins in semiconductor quantum dots (QDs) are promising local quantum memories to generate polarization-encoded photonic cluster states, as proposed in the pioneering Lindner and Rudolph scheme (2009 Phys. Rev. Lett. 103 113602). However, harnessing the polarization degree of freedom of the optical transitions is hindered by resonant excitation schemes that are widely used to obtain high photon indistinguishability. Here we show that acoustic phonon-assisted excitation, a scheme that preserves high indistinguishability, also allows to fully exploit the polarization selective optical transitions to initialise and measure single spin states. We access the coherence of hole spin systems in a low transverse magnetic field and directly monitor the spin Larmor precession both during the radiative emission process of an excited state or in the QD ground state. We report a spin state detection fidelity of 94.7 +/- 0.2% granted by the optical selection rules and a 25 +/- 5 ns hole spin coherence time, demonstrating the potential of this scheme and system to generate linear cluster states with a dozen of photons.

TI Kerr nonlinearity and parametric amplification with an Al-InAs
   superconductor-semiconductor Josephson junction
SO APPLIED PHYSICS LETTERS
AB Nearly quantum limited Josephson parametric amplifiers (JPAs) are essential components in superconducting quantum circuits. However, higher order nonlinearities of the Josephson cosine potential are known to cause gain compression, therefore limiting scalability. In an effort to reduce the fourth order, or Kerr nonlinearity, we realize a parametric amplifier with an Al-InAs superconductor-semiconductor hybrid Josephson junction (JJ). We extract the Kerr nonlinearity of the Al-InAs JJ from two different devices and show that it is three orders of magnitude lower compared to an Al-AlOX junction with identical Josephson inductance. We then demonstrate a four-wave-mixing (4WM) parametric amplifier made with an Al-InAs junction that achieves more than 20 dB of gain and -119 dBm of compression power, which outperforms single resonant JPAs based on Al junctions.

TI Experimental accreditation of outputs of noisy quantum computers
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB We provide and experimentally demonstrate an accreditation protocol that upper bounds the variation distance between noisy and noiseless probability distributions of the outputs of arbitrary quantum computations. We accredit the outputs of 24 quantum circuits executed on programmable superconducting hardware, ranging from depth-9 circuits on 10 qubits to depth-21 circuits on 4 qubits. Our protocol requires implementing the "target" quantum circuit along with a number of random Clifford circuits and subsequently postprocessing the outputs of these Clifford circuits. Importantly, the number of Clifford circuits is chosen to obtain the bound with the desired confidence and accuracy and is independent of the size and nature of the target circuit. We thus demonstrate a practical and scalable method of ascertaining the correctness of the outputs of arbitrary-sized noisy quantum computers-the ultimate arbiter of the utility of the computer itself.

TI Homological Invariants of Pauli Stabilizer Codes

AB We study translationally invariant Pauli stabilizer codes with qudits of arbitrary, not necessarily uniform, dimensions. Using homological methods, we define a series of invariants called charge modules. We describe their properties and physical meaning. The most complete results are obtained for codes whose charge modules have Krull dimension zero. This condition is interpreted as mobility of excitations. We show that it is always satisfied for translation invariant 2D codes with unique ground state in infinite volume, which was previously known only in the case of uniform, prime qudit dimension. For codes all of whose excitations are mobile we construct a p-dimensional excitation and a ( D - p - 1 ) \documentclass[12pt]{minimal} \usepackage{amsmath} \usepackage{wasysym} \usepackage{amsfonts} \usepackage{amssymb} \usepackage{amsbsy} \usepackage{mathrsfs} \usepackage{upgreek} \setlength{\oddsidemargin}{-69pt} \begin{document}$$(D-p-1)$$\end{document} -form symmetry for every element of the p-th charge module. Moreover, we define a braiding pairing between charge modules in complementary degrees. We discuss examples which illustrate how charge modules and braiding can be computed in practice.

TI Generalized squeezing as a witness of various quantum properties
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Quantum systems can be prepared in an infinite continuum of states, but only some of them can be used as resources for quantum technologies. Discerning whether a specific quantum state falls into this class is often a challenging task. We show that it can be performed by looking at the squeezing of the quantum states-a scenario in which the variance of some observable operator is suppressed below the threshold given by the nonuseful states. We discuss the general concept first; then, we illustrate the approach by evaluating cubic nonlinear squeezing in the system of collective atomic spins.

TI A NEAT quantum error decoder
SO SCIPOST PHYSICS
AB We investigate the use of the evolutionary NEAT algorithm for the optimization of a policy network that performs quantum error decoding on the toric code, with bitflip and depolarizing noise, one qubit at a time. We find that these NEAT-optimized network decoders have similar performance to previously reported machine-learning based decoders, but use roughly three to four orders of magnitude fewer parameters to do so.

TI Enhancing Initial State Overlap through Orbital Optimization for Faster
   Molecular Electronic Ground-State Energy Estimation
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB The phase estimation algorithm is crucial for computing the ground-state energy of a molecular electronic Hamiltonian on a quantum computer. Its efficiency depends on the overlap between the Hamiltonian's ground state and an initial state, which tends to decay exponentially with system size. We showcase a practical orbital optimization scheme to alleviate this issue. Applying our method to four ironsulfur molecules, we achieve a notable enhancement, up to 2 orders of magnitude, compared to localized orbitals. Furthermore, our approach yields improved overlaps in cytochrome P450 enzyme models.

TI Quantum cyber-physical systems
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB This paper aims to promote a quantum framework that analyzes Industry 4.0 cyber-physical systems more efficiently than traditional simulations used to represent integrated systems. The paper proposes a novel configuration of distributed quantum circuits in multilayered complex networks that enable the evaluation of industrial value creation chains. In particular, two different mechanisms for the integration of information between circuits operating at different layers are proposed, where their behavior is analyzed and compared with the classical conditional probability tables linked to the Bayesian networks. With the proposed method, both linear and nonlinear behaviors become possible while the complexity remains bounded. Applications in the case of Industry 4.0 are discussed when a component's health is under consideration, where the effect of integration between different quantum cyber-physical digital twin models appears as a relevant implication.

TI Foundations for Bayesian inference with engineered likelihood functions
   for robust amplitude estimation
SO JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICAL PHYSICS
AB We present mathematical and conceptual foundations for the task of robust amplitude estimation using engineered likelihood functions (ELFs), a framework introduced by Wang et al. [PRX Quantum 2, 010346 (2021)] that uses Bayesian inference to enhance the rate of information gain in quantum sampling. These ELFs, which are obtained by choosing tunable parameters in a parametrized quantum circuit to minimize the expected posterior variance of an estimated parameter, play an important role in estimating the expectation values of quantum observables. We give a thorough characterization and analysis of likelihood functions arising from certain classes of quantum circuits and combine this with the tools of Bayesian inference to give a procedure for picking optimal ELF tunable parameters. Finally, we present numerical results to demonstrate the performance of ELFs. Published under an exclusive license by AIP Publishing.

However, there are cases where we might want to combine the two, and recent proposals have shown how this might be achieved in entanglement-based systems. Here, we present an entanglement-free alternative that has advantages in terms of simplicity and practicality, requiring only individual qubits to be transmitted. We demonstrate the performance of the scheme in both the low and high data limits, showing quantum advantages both in terms of measurement precision and security against a range of possible attacks.

TI Efficient flow equations for dissipative systems
SO SCIPOST PHYSICS
AB Open quantum systems provide an essential theoretical basis for the development of novel quantum technologies, since any real quantum system inevitably interacts with its environment. Lindblad master equations capture the effect of Markovian environments. Closed quantum systems can be treated using flow equations with the particle conserving generator. We generalize this generator to non-Hermitian matrices and open quantum systems governed by Lindbladians, comparing our results with recently proposed generators by Rosso et al. [1]. In comparison, we find that our advocated generator provides an efficient flow with good accuracy in spite of truncations.

AB In this paper, we have fabricated two quantum random number generators (QRNGs) based on different mechanisms. The first one is based on the photon time of arrival and produces high-quality random numbers without the need for post-processing but using expensive equipment. The second one is based on the tunneling effect in a Zener diode and produces random strings with comparable quality but using low-cost equipment. We then evaluated the random sequences from these QRNGs using a set of statistical tests and showed that they are suitable for special applications such as quantum technologies.

In this work, we propose a general quantum state tomography framework that employs deep neural networks to reconstruct quantum states from a set of measurements with high efficiency. In particular, we apply it to two cases, including few measurement copies and incomplete measurement. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed method exhibits a significant potential to achieve high fidelity for quantum state tomography when measurement resources are limited.

SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB Generation, storage, and utilization of correlated many-body quantum states are crucial objectives of future quantum technologies and metrology. Such states can be generated by the spin-squeezing protocols, i.e., one-axis twisting and two-axis countertwisting. In this Letter, we show activation of these two squeezing mechanisms in a system composed of ultracold atomic fermions in the Mott insulating phase by a position-dependent laser coupling of atomic internal states. Realization of both the squeezing protocols is feasible in the current state-of-the-art experiments.

TI Development of hard masks for reactive ion beam angled etching of
   diamond
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB Diamond offers good optical properties and hosts bright color centers with long spin coherence times. Recent advances in angled-etching of diamond, specifically with reactive ion beam angled etching (RIBAE), have led to successful demonstration of quantum photonic devices operating at visible wavelengths. However, larger devices operating at telecommunication wavelengths have been difficult to fabricate due to the increased mask erosion, arising from the increased size of devices requiring longer etch times. We evaluated different mask materials for RIBAE of diamond photonic crystal nanobeams and waveguides, and how their thickness, selectivity, aspect ratio and sidewall smoothness affected the resultant etch profiles and optical performance. We found that a thick hydrogen silesquioxane (HSQ) layer on a thin alumina adhesion layer provided the best etch profile and optical performance. The techniques explored in this work can also be adapted to other bulk materials that are not available heteroepitaxially or as thin films-on-insulator.

AB In this paper, we introduce a quantum photonic device, which we term the photonic Bier-Glas cavity. We discuss its fabrication and functionality, which is based on the coupling of integrated In(Ga)As quantum dots to a broadband photonic cavity resonance. By design, the device architecture uniquely combines the Purcell enhancement of a photonic micropillar structure with a broadband photonic mode shaping of a vertical, tapered waveguide, making it an interesting candidate to enable the efficient extraction of entangled photon pairs. We detail the epitaxial growth of the heterostructure as well as the necessary lithography steps to approach a GaAsbased photonic device with a height exceeding 15 mu m, supported on a pedestal that can be as thin as 20 nm. We further describe its key performance parameters using a Fourier-modal method. Finally, we present an optical characterization, which confirms the presence of broadband optical resonances, in conjunction with amplified spontaneous emission of single photons.

TI Interference Effect of Beam Splitter Current in Iron-Pnictide
   Superconductors
SO JOURNAL OF SUPERCONDUCTIVITY AND NOVEL MAGNETISM
AB We consider a Cooper pair beam splitter for an iron-pnictide superconductor and calculate the entangled electron-hole current. We investigate the interplay of various physical parameters such as doping at electron and hole pockets as well as non-zero nesting between the electron and hole pocket. We find that in the absence of magnetic order, the currents due to hole pocket and electron pocket add up ordinarily. However, in the presence of magnetic ordering, the two currents take part in characteristic interference effect to modify the resultant current significantly. This interference effect manifests itself in the non-monotonous and oscillatory nature of a beam splitter current. We investigate in detail this non-monotonicity with the chemical potential as well as nesting vectror Iqi. We also investigate the evolution of density of states with system parameters and correlate it with the beam-splitter current. Furthermore, we enumerate the relevant parameter space where the efficiency of such a beam splitter setup is enhanced. Our finding can be useful in experimental determination or verification of a coexistence phase in iron-pnictide superconductors and has potential applications in realizing quantum gates or switches.

TI Non-adiabatic quantum control of quantum dot arrays with fixed exchange
   using Cartan decomposition
SO PHILOSOPHICAL TRANSACTIONS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY A-MATHEMATICAL PHYSICAL
   AND ENGINEERING SCIENCES
AB In semiconductor spin qubits which typically interact through short-range exchange coupling, shuttling of spin is a practical way to generate quantum operations between distant qubits. Although the exchange is often tunable through voltages applied to gate electrodes, its minimal value can be significantly large, which hinders the applicability of existing shuttling protocols to such devices, requiring a different approach. In this work, we extend our previous results for double- and triple-dot systems, and describe a method for implementing spin state transfer in long chains of singly occupied quantum dots in a non-adiabatic manner. We make use of Cartan decomposition to break down the interacting problem into simpler problems in a systematic way, and use dynamical invariants to design smooth non-adiabatic pulses that can be implemented in devices with modest control bandwidth. Finally, we discuss the extensibility of our results to directed shuttling of spin states on two-dimensional lattices of quantum dots with fixed coupling.This article is part of the theme issue 'Shortcuts to adiabaticity: theoretical, experimental and interdisciplinary perspectives'.

TI Open quantum rotors: Connecting correlations and physical currents
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB We consider a finite one-dimensional chain of quantum rotors interacting with a set of thermal baths at different temperatures. When the interaction between the rotors is made chiral, such a system behaves as an autonomous thermal motor, converting heat currents into nonvanishing rotational ones. Such a dynamical response is strongly pronounced in the range of the Hamiltonian parameters for which the ground state of the system in the thermodynamic limit exhibits a quantum phase transition. Such working points are associated with large quantum coherence and multipartite quantum correlations within the state of the system. This suggests that the optimal operating regime of such a quantum autonomous motor is one of maximal quantumness.

SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Coarse graining is a common imperfection of realistic quantum measurement, obstructing the direct observation of quantum features. Under highly coarse-grained measurement, we experimentally certify the continuous-variable nonclassicality of both Gaussian and non-Gaussian states. Remarkably, we find that this coarse-grained measurement outperforms the conventional fine-grained measurement for nonclassicality certification: it detects nonclassicality beyond the reach of the variance criterion, and furthermore, it exhibits stronger statistical significance than the high-order moments method. Our work demonstrates the usefulness of coarse-grained measurement by providing a reliable and efficient way of nonclassicality certification for quantum technologies.

TI Robust Encryption Framework for IoT Devices Based on Bit-plane

SO INTERNET OF THINGS
AB In the domain of Internet of Things (IoT) applications, quantum computers offer the promise of addressing complex computational issues that traditional cryptographic methods find challenging. The unparalleled computational power of quantum computers makes existing cryptographic schemes, tailored to mitigate computational complexity, ineffective. This research introduces a robust encryption scheme designed specifically for digital data exchanged between IoT devices such as smartphones, smart sensors, and smart health monitoring devices. The proposed encryption framework is based on bit-plane extraction-based encryption, the chaotic sine model, the hyperchaotic map, the quantum baker map, and quantum operations such as quantum selective scrambling. The proposed methodology involves three key phases: the first and last phase related to permutation, which is performed at the bit level based on discrete bit-plane scrambling, bit-plane extraction, and hyperchaotic mapping. However, the second phase is based on diffusion, which depends on the chaotic sine model. During the initial stage, creating correlations among image pixels, along with a couple of chaotic sequences using a quantum baker map, is accomplished through a superposition of quantum-states. Before applying diffusion, the pixels of the grayscale image are encoded using a single qubit, and quantum operations are based on a quantum circuit featuring swap gates. To introduce pixel-level permutation, a hyperchaotic map generates random sequences within the range of 0 to 255. A circular shift further shuffles the pixel rows and pixel columns of the permuted image pixels. To enhance the digital image security further, bit-planes are extracted from the permuted bit-planes. Then, the bits within each bit plane are scrambled using a random sequence generated by the hyperchaotic map. Finally, the encoded bit planes are merged to produce a final encrypted image. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methodology, with security parameters such as correlation, entropy, and key space measuring at 0.0001, 7.999, and >2(100), respectively. Furthermore, to assess performance in relation to computational complexity, a detailed analysis of computational time is conducted. The results reveal that the proposed encryption scheme can execute all encryption steps presented in the proposed method in less than one second. These findings demonstrate the secure transmission of digital data between IoT devices and show the suitability of the proposed encryption scheme for real-time applications.

TI Tensor networks for black hole interiors: non-isometries, quantum
   extremal surfaces, and wormholes
SO JOURNAL OF HIGH ENERGY PHYSICS
AB We use hyperbolic tensor networks to construct a holographic map for black hole interiors that adds a notion of locality to the non-isometric codes proposed by Akers, Engelhardt, Harlow, Penington, and Vardhan. We use tools provided by these networks to study the relationship between non-isometries and quantum extremal surfaces behind the horizon. Furthermore, we introduce a limited notion of dynamics for these interior tensor networks based on the qudit models introduced by Akers et al., and study the evolution of quantum extremal surfaces in an evaporating black hole. We also find a tensor network description of a wormhole connecting the black hole interior to the radiation, providing a mechanism for interior states and operators to be encoded in the radiation after the Page time. As a particular case, we construct a tensor network realization of the backwards-forwards maps recently proposed to incorporate non-trivial effective dynamics in dynamical constructions of these non-isometric black hole codes.

TI Stabilizing steady-state properties of open quantum systems with
   parameter engineering
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Realistic quantum systems are affected by environmental loss, which is often seen as detrimental for applications in quantum technologies. Alternatively, weak coupling to an environment can aid in stabilizing highly entangled and mixed states, but determining optimal system-environment parameters can be challenging. Here, we describe a technique to optimize parameters for generating desired nonequilibrium steady states (NESSs) in driven-dissipative quantum systems governed by the Lindblad equation. We apply this approach to predict highly entangled and mixed NESSs in Ising, Kitaev, and Dicke models in several quantum phases.

AB Quantum Fisher information is the principal tool used to give the ultimate precision bound on the estimation of parameters for quantum channels. In this work, we present analytical expressions for the quantum Fisher information with three noisy channels for the case where the channels are in superposition of causal orders. We found that the quantum Fisher information increases as the number of causal orders increases for certain combinations. We also show that certain combinations of causal orders attain higher precision on bounds than others for the same number of causal orders. Based on our results, we chose the best combinations of causal orders with three channels for probing schemes using indefinite causal structures.

TI Engineering synthetic gauge fields through the coupling phases in cavity
   magnonics
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW APPLIED
AB Cavity magnonics, which studies the interaction of light with magnetic systems in a cavity, is a promising platform for quantum transducers and quantum memories. At microwave frequencies, the coupling between a cavity photon and a magnon, the quasiparticle of a spin-wave excitation, is a consequence of the Zeeman interaction between the cavity's magnetic field and the magnet's macroscopic spin. For each photon-magnon interaction, a coupling phase factor exists, and this is often neglected in simple systems; however, in "loop-coupled" systems, where there are at least as many couplings as modes, the coupling phases become relevant for the physics and lead to synthetic gauge fields. We present experimental evidence of the existence of such coupling phases by considering two spheres made of yttrium-iron-garnet and two different re-entrant cavities. We predict numerically the values of the coupling phases, and we find good agreement between the theory and the experimental data. These results show that in cavity magnonics, one can engineer synthetic gauge fields, which can be useful for cavity-mediated coupling and engineering dark-mode physics.

TI Mid-infrared photon pair generation in AgGaS2
SO APPLIED PHYSICS LETTERS
AB We demonstrate nondegenerate photon pair generation by spontaneous parametric downconversion in a silver gallium sulfide AgGaS2 crystal. By tuning the pump wavelength, we achieve phase matching over a large spectral range. This allows to generate idler photons in the mid-infrared spectral range above a 6 mu m wavelength with corresponding signal photons in the visible. Also, we show photon pair generation with broad spectral bandwidth. These results are a valuable step toward the development of quantum imaging and sensing techniques in the mid-infrared.

TI Synchronization and non-Markovianity in open quantum systems
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Y Detuned systems can spontaneously achieve a synchronous dynamics and display robust quantum correlations in different local and global dissipation regimes. Beyond the Markovian limit, information backflow from the environment becomes a crucial mechanism whose interplay with spontaneous synchronization is unknown. Considering a model of two coupled qubits, one of which interacts with a dissipative environment, we show that non-Markovianity is highly detrimental for the emergence of synchronization, for the latter can be delayed and hindered because of the presence of information backflow. The results are obtained considering both a master equation approach and a collision model based on repeated interactions, which represents a very versatile tool to tailor the desired kind of environment.

TI Quantum Markov chain Monte Carlo with digital dissipative dynamics on
   quantum computers
SO QUANTUM SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB Modeling the dynamics of a quantum system connected to the environment is critical for advancing our understanding of complex quantum processes, as most quantum processes in nature are affected by an environment. Modeling a macroscopic environment on a quantum simulator may be achieved by coupling independent ancilla qubits that facilitate energy exchange in an appropriate manner with the system and mimic an environment. This approach requires a large, and possibly exponential number of ancillary degrees of freedom which is impractical. In contrast, we develop a digital quantum algorithm that simulates interaction with an environment using a small number of ancilla qubits. By combining periodic modulation of the ancilla energies, or spectral combing, with periodic reset operations, we are able to mimic interaction with a large environment and generate thermal states of interacting many-body systems. We evaluate the algorithm by simulating preparation of thermal states of the transverse Ising model. Our algorithm can also be viewed as a quantum Markov chain Monte Carlo process that allows sampling of the Gibbs distribution of a multivariate model. To demonstrate this we evaluate the accuracy of sampling Gibbs distributions of simple probabilistic graphical models using the algorithm.

TI Genuinely entangling uncorrelated atoms via Jaynes-Cummings interactions
SO QUANTUM INFORMATION PROCESSING
AB We study three independent pairs of Jaynes-Cummings systems such that two atoms might be correlated with each other but the third atom is uncorrelated with rest. We investigate the conditions under which these uncorrelated three atoms may become genuinely entangled. We find that this task is impossible if the cavity interacting with uncorrelated atom share classical correlations with any other cavity. We observe that atomic state can become genuine multipartite entangled, at least if the cavity with uncorrelated atom, is highly entangled with any other cavity. This is an interesting and non-trivial observation and may serve as another technique to generate multipartite entangled atoms via JC-interactions.

TI Quantum Classification Outside the Promised Class
SO COMPUTERS
AB This paper studies the important problem of quantum classification of Boolean functions from an entirely novel perspective. Typically, quantum classification algorithms allow us to classify functions with a probability of 1.0, if we are promised that they meet specific unique properties. The primary objective of this study is to explore whether it is feasible to obtain any insights when the input function deviates from the promised class. For concreteness, we use a recently introduced quantum algorithm that is designed to classify a large class of imbalanced Boolean functions with probability 1.0 using just a single oracular query. First, we establish a completely new concept characterizing "nearness" between Boolean functions. Utilizing this concept, we show that, as long as the unknown function is close enough to the promised class, it is still possible to obtain useful information about its behavioral pattern from the classification algorithm. In this regard, the current study is among the first to provide evidence that shows how useful it is to apply quantum classification algorithms to functions outside the promised class in order to get a glimpse of important information.

TI Subradiance with Saturated Atoms: Population Enhancement of the
   Long-Lived States
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB Dipole-dipole interactions are at the origin of long-lived collective atomic states, often called subradiant, which are explored for their potential use in novel photonic devices or in quantum protocols. Here, we study subradiance beyond the single-excitation regime and experimentally demonstrate a 200-fold increase in the population of these modes, as the saturation parameter of the driving field is increased. We attribute this enhancement to a mechanism similar to optical pumping through the well-coupled superradiant states. The lifetimes are unaffected by the pump strength, as the system is ultimately driven toward the single-excitation sector. Our study is a new step in the exploration of the many-body dynamics of large open systems.

TI Gravitationally induced unified relation among duality, coherence,
   steering, and maximal average fidelity
SO EUROPEAN PHYSICAL JOURNAL C
AB Recently, numerous measures have been proposed for quantifying the quantumness of a given system, and the existence of intrinsic connections among quantum resource measures has been proven. Here, we study the unified relationship between duality, first-order coherence, three-setting linear steering inequality, and maximum average fidelity between two masses due to gravity. Under gravitational inducement, an equivalent relationship was identified between the first-order coherence and duality. The coherence of a system can be controlled by adjusting arm lengths and the distance between the arms of an interferometer. In most cases, the first-order coherence of a system cannot be maximised. Furthermore, a trade-off relationship between gravitationally induced duality and steering violations was derived. We can adjust the arm length and distance between the arms of the interferometer such that the steering violation reaches its maximum at phase pi\documentclass[12pt]{minimal} \usepackage{amsmath} \usepackage{wasysym} \usepackage{amsfonts} \usepackage{amssymb} \usepackage{amsbsy} \usepackage{mathrsfs} \usepackage{upgreek} \setlength{\oddsidemargin}{-69pt} \begin{document}$$\pi $$\end{document}. The results show that the value of the steering violation is always greater than 1; that is, the state of the system is steerable. In addition, we explored the intrinsic relationship between duality and the maximal average fidelity due to gravity. In most cases, the maximum average fidelity of the system is greater than 2/3, indicating that the state is useful for quantum teleportation. These results are important for investigating the intrinsic relationships among various quantum resources within the framework of gravity.

TI High-precision robust monitoring of charge/discharge current over a wide
   dynamic range for electric vehicle batteries using diamond quantum
   sensors
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB Accurate prediction of the remaining driving range of electric vehicles is difficult because the state-of-the-art sensors for measuring battery current are not accurate enough to estimate the state of charge. This is because the battery current of EVs can reach a maximum of several hundred amperes while the average current is only approximately 10 A, and ordinary sensors do not have an accuracy of several tens of milliamperes while maintaining a dynamic range of several hundred amperes. Therefore, the state of charge has to be estimated with an ambiguity of approximately 10%, which makes the battery usage inefficient. This study resolves this limitation by developing a diamond quantum sensor with an inherently wide dynamic range and high sensitivity for measuring the battery current. The design uses the differential detection of two sensors to eliminate in-vehicle common-mode environmental noise, and a mixed analog-digital control to trace the magnetic resonance microwave frequencies of the quantum sensor without deviation over a wide dynamic range. The prototype battery monitor was fabricated and tested. The battery module current was measured up to 130 A covering WLTC driving pattern, and the accuracy of the current sensor to estimate battery state of charge was analyzed to be 10 mA, which will lead to 0.2% CO2 reduction emitted in the 2030 WW transportation field. Moreover, an operating temperature range of - 40 to + 85 degrees C and a maximum current dynamic range of +/- 1000 A were confirmed.

TI Unitary symmetry-protected non-Abelian statistics of Majorana modes
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
AB Symmetry-protected topological superconductors (TSCs) can host multiple Majorana zero modes (MZMs) at their edges or vortex cores, while whether the Majorana braiding in such systems is non-Abelian in general remains an open question. Here, we uncover in theory the unitary symmetry-protected non-Abelian statistics of MZMs and propose the experimental realization. We show that braiding two vortices with each hosting N MZMs protected by commutative or noncommutative unitary symmetries generically reduces to N independent sectors, with each sector braiding two different Majorana modes. This renders the unitary symmetry-protected non-Abelian statistics. We demonstrate the proposed non-Abelian statistics in a spin-triplet TSC which hosts two MZMs at each vortex and, interestingly, can be precisely mapped to a quantum anomalous Hall insulator. Thus the unitary symmetry-protected non-Abelian statistics can be verified in the latter insulating phase, with the application to realizing various topological quantum gates being studied, and an experimental scheme of observation being proposed. This work suggests that there are a much broader range of symmetry-protected topological superconductors which host non-Abelian Majorana modes.

AB In the quantum compression scheme proposed by Schumacher, Alice compresses a message that Bob decompresses. In that approach, there is some probability of failure and, even when successful, some distortion of the state. For sufficiently large blocklengths, both of these imperfections can be made arbitrarily small while achieving a compression rate that asymptotically approaches the source coding bound. However, direct implementation of Schumacher compression suffers from poor circuit complexity. In this paper, we consider a slightly different approach based on classical syndrome source coding. The idea is to use a linear error-correcting code and treat the state to be compressed as a superposition of error patterns. Then, Alice can use quantum gates to apply the parity-check matrix to her message state. This will convert it into a superposition of syndromes. If the original superposition was supported on correctable errors (e.g., coset leaders), then this process can be reversed by decoding. An implementation of this based on polar codes is described and simulated. As in classical source coding based on polar codes, Alice maps the information into the "frozen" qubits that constitute the syndrome. To decompress, Bob utilizes a quantum version of successive cancellation coding.

TI Electric field sensing via Rydberg electromagnetically induced
   transparency using Zeeman and Stark effects
SO JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYSICS
AB Rydberg-assisted atomic electrometry with thermal vapors offers a promising approach for detecting external electric fields. However, this technique presents significant challenges for measuring low frequencies due to the effects of metal-alkali atoms adsorbed on the interior surface of the vacuum chamber. In this work, we apply high-contrast Rydberg electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT) spectroscopy to systematically investigate these effects, including the influence of laser power and electric field strength. We demonstrate the ability to measure electric field frequencies ranging from 10 Hz to 1 MHz. Additionally, this study identifies a fundamental limit for data capacity in such measurements. Furthermore, we propose a method for precise Stark shift measurements by locking the coupling laser to Zeeman-split Rydberg EIT peaks. Using the Zeeman shift in a reference cell as a stable frequency reference, we are able to track Stark-induced shifts in a science cell and confirm excellent agreement with theoretical predictions. These results provide valuable insights for future precision measurement techniques and field sensing applications based on Rydberg atom systems. (c) 2025 Author(s).

TI A quantum segmentation algorithm based on local adaptive threshold for
   NEQR image
SO MODERN PHYSICS LETTERS A
AB The classical image segmentation algorithm based on local adaptive threshold can effectively segment images with uneven illumination, but with the increase of the image data, the real-time problem gradually emerges. In this paper, a quantum segmentation algorithm based on local adaptive threshold for NEQR image is proposed, which can use quantum mechanism to simultaneously compute local thresholds for all pixels in a gray-scale image and quickly segment the image into a binary image. In addition, several quantum circuit units, including median calculation, quantum binarization, etc. are designed in detail, and then a complete quantum circuit is designed to segment NEQR images by using fewer qubits and quantum gates. For a 2(n) x 2(n) image with q gray-scale levels, the complexity of our algorithm can be reduced to O(n(2) + q), which is an exponential speedup compared to the classic counterparts. Finally, the experiment is conducted on IBM Q to show the feasibility of our algorithm in the noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) era.

TI Three-Dimensional Quantum Cellular Automata from Chiral Semion Surface
   Topological Order and beyond
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB We construct a novel three-dimensional quantum cellular automaton (QCA) based on a system with short-range entangled bulk and chiral semion boundary topological order. We argue that either the QCA is nontrivial, i.e., not a finite-depth circuit of local quantum gates, or there exists a two-dimensional commuting projector Hamiltonian realizing the chiral semion topological order [characterized by U(1)2 Chern-Simons theory]. Our QCA is obtained by first constructing the Walker-Wang Hamiltonian of a certain premodular tensor category of order four, then condensing the deconfined bulk boson at the level of lattice operators. We show that the resulting Hamiltonian hosts chiral semion surface topological order in the presence of a boundary and can be realized as a non-Pauli stabilizer code on qubits, from which the QCA is defined. The construction is then generalized to a class of QCAs defined by non-Pauli stabilizer codes on 2n-dimensional qudits that feature surface anyons described by U(1)2n Chern-Simons theory. Our results support the conjecture that the group of nontrivial three-dimensional QCAs is isomorphic to the Witt group of nondegenerate braided fusion categories.

TI Topological state permutations in time-modulated non-Hermitian
   multiqubit systems with suppressed nonadiabatic transitions
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Non-Hermitian systems have been at the center of intense research for over a decade, partly due to their nontrivial energy topology formed by intersecting Riemann manifolds with branch points known as exceptional points (EPs). This spectral property can be exploited, e.g., to achieve topologically controlled state permutations that are necessary for implementing a wide class of classical and quantum information protocols. However, the complex-valued spectra of typical non-Hermitian systems lead to instabilities, losses, and breakdown of adiabaticity, which impedes the practical use of EP-induced energy topologies in quantum information protocols based on state permutation symmetries. Indeed, in a given non-Hermitian multiqubit system, the dynamical winding around EPs always results in a predetermined set of attenuated final eigenstates, due to the interplay of decoherence and nonadiabatic transitions, irrespective of the initial conditions. In this work, we address this long-standing problem by introducing a model of interacting qubits governed by an effective non-Hermitian Hamiltonian that hosts a special type of EPs while maintaining a completely real energy spectrum, ensuring the absence of losses in the system's dynamics. We demonstrate that such non-Hermitian Hamiltonians enable the realization of genuine, in general, non-Abelian permutation groups in the multiqubit system's eigenspace while dynamically encircling these EPs. Our findings indicate that, contrary to previous beliefs, non-Hermiticity can be utilized to achieve controlled topological state permutations in time-modulated multiqubit systems, thus paving the way for the advancement and development of quantum information protocols in real-world non-Hermitian quantum systems.

TI Coherent ground-state transport of neutral atoms
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Quantum state transport is an important way to study the energy or information flow. By combining the unconventional Rydberg pumping mechanism and the diagonal form of van der Waals interactions, we construct a theoretical model via second-order perturbation theory to realize a long-range coherent transport inside the ground-state manifold of neutral atoms systems. With the adjustment of the Rabi frequencies and the interatomic distance, this model can be used to simulate various single-body physics phenomena such as a Heisenberg XX spin chain restricted in the single-excitation manifold, coherently perfect quantum state transfer, the parameter-adjustable Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model, and chiral motion of atomic excitation in a triangle by varying the geometrical arrangement of the three atoms, which effectively avoids the influence of atomic spontaneous emission at the same time. Moreover, the influence of atomic position fluctuation on the fidelity of quantum state transmission is discussed in detail, and the corresponding numerical results show that our work provides a robust and easily implemented scheme for quantum state transport with neutral atoms.

TI Symmetrically Threaded Superconducting Quantum Interference Devices as
   Next-Generation Kerr-Cat Qubits
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB Kerr-cat qubits are bosonic qubits offering autonomous bit-flip protection, traditionally studied using driven superconducting nonlinear asymmetric inductive element (SNAIL) oscillators. Here, we theoretically explore an alternative circuit for Kerr-cat qubits based on symmetrically threaded superconducting quantum interference devices (SQUIDs). The symmetrically threaded SQUID (STS) architecture employs a simplified flux-pumped design that suppresses two-photon dissipation, a dominant loss mechanism in high-Kerr regimes, by engineering the drive Hamiltonian's flux operator to generate only even-order harmonics. By fulfilling two critical criteria for practical Kerr-cat qubit operation, the STS emerges as an ideal platform: (1) a static Hamiltonian with diluted Kerr nonlinearity (achieved via the STS's middle branch) and (2) a drive Hamiltonian restricted to even harmonics, which ensures robust two-photon driving with reduced dissipation. For weak Kerr nonlinearity, we find that the coherent state lifetime (T alpha) is similar between STS and SNAIL circuits. However, STS Kerr-cat qubits exhibit enhanced resistance to higher-order photon dissipation, enabling significantly extended T alpha even with stronger Kerr nonlinearities (approximately 10 MHz). In contrast to SNAIL, STS Kerr-cat qubits display a T alpha dip under weak two-photon driving for a high Kerr coefficient. We demonstrate that this dip can be suppressed by applying drive-dependent detuning, enabling Kerr-cat qubit operation with only eight Josephson junctions (of energies 80 GHz); fewer junctions suffice for higher junction energies. We further validate the robustness of the STS design by studying the impact of strong flux driving and asymmetric Josephson junctions on T alpha. With the proposed design and considering a cat size of ten photons, we predict T alpha of the order of tens of milliseconds, even in the presence of multiphoton heating and dephasing effects. The robustness of the STS Kerr-cat qubit makes it a promising component for fault-tolerant quantum processors.

TI Generalized n-locality inequalities in a star-network configuration and
   their optimal quantum violations
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Network Bell experiments reveal a form of nonlocality conceptually different from standard Bell nonlocality. Standard multiparty Bell experiments involve a single source shared by a set of observers. In contrast network Bell experiments feature multiple independent sources and each of them may distribute physical systems to a set of observers who perform randomly chosen measurements. The n-locality scenario in star-network configuration is an instance of network Bell experiment. Such a scenario involves n number of edge observers (Alices) a central observer (Bob) and n number of independent sources having no prior correlation. Each Alice shares an independent state with the central observer Bob. Usually in network Bell experiments one considers that each party measures only two observables. In this work we propose a nontrivial generalization of n-locality scenario in star-network configuration where each Alice performs some integer m number of binary-outcome measurements and the central party Bob performs 2m-1 measurements. We derive a family of generalized n-locality inequalities for any arbitrary m. Using an elegant sum-of-squares approach we derive the optimal quantum violation of the aforementioned inequalities when each and every Alice measures m number of mutually anticommuting observables. For m = 2 and 3 one obtains the optimal quantum value with a two-qubit entangled state shared between each Alice and Bob. We further demonstrate that the optimal quantum violation of n-locality inequality for any arbitrary m can be obtained when every Alice shares Lm/2J copies of two-qubit maximally entangled state with the central party Bob. We also argue that form > 3 a single copy of a two-qubit-entangled state may not be enough to exhibit the violation of n-locality inequality but multiple copies of it can activate the quantum violation. We discuss the implications of our study and raise some open questions.

TI Sensing at the Nanoscale Using Nitrogen-Vacancy Centers in Diamond: A
   Model for a Quantum Pressure Sensor
SO NANOMATERIALS
AB The sensing of stress under harsh environmental conditions with high resolution has critical importance for a range of applications including earth's subsurface scanning, geological CO2 storage monitoring, and mineral and resource recovery. Using a first-principles density functional theory (DFT) approach combined with the theoretical modelling of the low-energy Hamiltonian, here, we investigate a novel approach to detect unprecedented levels of pressure by taking advantage of the solid-state electronic spin of nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamond. We computationally explore the effect of strain on the defect band edges and band gaps by varying the lattice parameters of a diamond supercell hosting a single NV center. A low-energy Hamiltonian is developed that includes the effect of stress on the energy level of a +/- 1 spin manifold at the ground state. By quantifying the energy level shift and split, we predict pressure sensing of up to 0.3 MPa/Hz using the experimentally measured spin dephasing time. We show the superiority of the quantum sensing approach over traditional optical sensing techniques by discussing our results from DFT and theoretical modelling for the frequency shift per unit pressure. Importantly, we propose a quantum manometer that could be useful to measure earth's subsurface vibrations as well as for pressure detection and monitoring in high-temperature superconductivity studies and in material sciences. Our results open avenues for the development of a sensing technology with high sensitivity and resolution under extreme pressure limits that potentially has a wider applicability than the existing pressure sensing technologies.

TI Spiraling light: from donut modes to a Magnus effect analogy
SO NANOPHOTONICS
AB The insight that optical vortex beams carry orbital angular momentum (OAM), which emerged in Leiden about 30 years ago, has since led to an ever expanding range of applications and follow-up studies. This paper starts with a short personal account of how these concepts arose. This is followed by a description of some recent ideas where the coupling of transverse orbital and spin angular momentum (SAM) in tightly focused laser beams produces interesting new effects. The deflection of a focused light beam by an atom in the focus is reminiscent of the Magnus effect known from aerodynamics. Momentum conservation dictates an accompanying light force on the atom, transverse to the optical axis. As a consequence, an atom held in an optical tweezer will be trapped at a small distance of up to lambda/2 pi away from the optical axis, which depends on the spin state of the atom and the magnetic field direction. This opens up new avenues to control the state of motion of atoms in optical tweezers as well as potential applications in quantum gates and interferometry.

TI Quantum encoding of dynamic directed graphs
SO JOURNAL OF LOGICAL AND ALGEBRAIC METHODS IN PROGRAMMING
AB In application domains such as routing, network analysis, scheduling, and planning, directed graphs are widely used as both formal models and core data structures for the development of efficient algorithmic solutions. In these areas, graphs are often evolving in time: for example, connection links may fail due to temporary technical issues, meaning that edges of the graph cannot be traversed for some time interval and alternative paths have to be followed.In classical computation graphs have been implemented both explicitly through adjacency matrices/lists and symbolically as ordered binary decision diagrams. Moreover, ad-hoc visit procedures have been developed to deal with dynamically evolving graphs. Quantum computation, exploiting interference and entanglement, has provided an exponential speed-up for specific problems, e.g., database search and integer factorization. In the quantum framework everything must be represented and manipulated using reversible operators. This poses a challenge when one has to deal with traversals of dynamically evolving directed graphs. Graph traversals are not intrinsically reversible because of converging paths. In the case of dynamically evolving graphs also the creation/destruction of paths comes into play against reversibility.In this paper we propose a novel high level graph representation in quantum computation supporting dynamic connectivity typical of real-world network applications. Our procedure allows to encode any multigraph into a unitary matrix. We devise algorithms for computing the encoding that are optimal in terms of time and space and we show the effectiveness of the proposal with some examples. We describe how to react to edge/node failures in constant time. Furthermore, we present two methods to perform quantum random walks taking advantage of this encoding: with and without projectors. We implement and test our encoding obtaining that the theoretical bounds for the running time are confirmed by the empirical results and providing more details on the behavior of the algorithms over graphs of different densities.

TI Scaling of contraction costs for entanglement renormalization algorithms
   including tensor Trotterization and variational Monte Carlo
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
AB The multiscale entanglement renormalization ansatz (MERA) is a hierarchical class of tensor network states motivated by the real-space renormalization group. It is used to simulate strongly correlated quantum many-body systems. For prominent MERA structures in one and two spatial dimensions and different optimization strategies, we determine the optimal scaling of contraction costs as well as corresponding contraction sequences and algorithmic phase diagrams. This is motivated by recent efforts to employ MERA in hybrid quantum-classical algorithms, where the MERA tensors are Trotterized, i.e., chosen as circuits of quantum gates, and observables as well as energy gradients are evaluated by sampling causal-cone states. We investigate whether tensor Trotterization and/or variational Monte Carlo (VMC) sampling can lead to quantum-inspired classical MERA algorithms that perform better than the traditional optimization of full MERA based on the exact evaluation of energy gradients. Algorithmic phase diagrams indicate the best MERA method depending on the scaling of the energy accuracy and the optimal number of Trotter steps with the bond dimension. The results suggest substantial gains due to VMC for two-dimensional systems.

TI In Situ-Tunable Spin-Spin Interactions in a Penning Trap with In-Bore
   Optomechanics
SO ADVANCED QUANTUM TECHNOLOGIES
AB Experimental implementations of quantum simulation must balance control-field-induced decoherence with the controllability of the quantum system. The ratio of coherent interaction strength to decoherence induced by stimulated emission in atomic systems is typically determined by hardware constraints, limiting the flexibility needed to explore different operating regimes. Here, an optomechanical system is presented for in situ tuning of the coherent spin-motion and spin-spin interaction strength in 2D ion crystals in a Penning trap. Enabled by precision closed-loop piezo-actuated positioners integrated into the confined space of a superconducting magnet's bore, the system allows tuning of the angle-of-incidence of Raman laser beams up to theta ODF approximate to 28 degrees$\theta _{\mathrm{ODF}}\approx 28<^>\circ$, governing the ratio of coherent to incoherent light-matter interaction for fixed optical power. System characterization involves measurements of the induced mean-field spin precession under the application of an optical dipole force in ion crystals cooled below the Doppler limit through electromagnetically induced transparency cooling. These experiments show approximately a x2$\times 2$ variation in the coherent to incoherent interaction ratio with changing theta ODF$\theta _{\text{ODF}}$, consistent with theoretical predictions. The system stability is characterized over 6000 s, resulting in a drift rate of 0.002 degrees$0.{002}<^>{\circ}$ h-1. These technical developments will be crucial in future quantum simulations and sensing applications.

TI State transfer on paths with weighted loops
SO QUANTUM INFORMATION PROCESSING
AB We consider the fidelity of state transfer on an unweighted path on n >= 3 vertices, where a loop of weight w has been appended at each of the end vertices. It is known that if w is transcendental, then there is pretty good state transfer from one end vertex to the other; we prove a companion result to that fact, namely that there is a dense subset of [1,infinity) such that if w is in that subset, pretty good state transfer between end vertices is impossible. Under mild hypotheses on w and t, we derive upper and lower bounds on the fidelity of state transfer between end vertices at readout time t. Using those bounds, we localise the readout times for which that fidelity is close to 1. We also provide expressions for, and bounds on, the sensitivity of the fidelity of state transfer between end vertices, where the sensitivity is with respect to either the readout time or the weight w. Throughout, the results rely on detailed knowledge of the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the associated adjacency matrix.

TI Linear and Nonlinear Optical Properties of All-cis and
   All-trans Poly(p-phenylenevinylene)
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY C
AB Poly(p-phenylenevinylene) (PPV) is a staple of the family of conjugated polymers with desirable optoelectronic properties for applications including light-emitting diodes (LEDs) and photovoltaic devices. Although the significant impact of olefin geometry on the steady-state optical properties of PPVs has been extensively studied, PPVs with precise stereochemistry have yet to be investigated using nonlinear optical spectroscopy for quantum sensing, as well as light harvesting for biological applications. Herein, we report our investigation of the influence of olefin stereochemistry on both linear and nonlinear optical properties through the synthesis of all-cis and all-trans PPV copolymers. We performed two-photon absorption (TPA) using a classical and entangled light source and compared both classical TPA and entangled two-photon absorption (ETPA) cross sections of these stereodefined PPVs. Whereas the TPA cross section of the all-trans PPV was expectedly higher than that of all-cis PPV, presumably because of the larger transition dipole moment, the opposite trend was measured via ETPA, with the all-cis PPV exhibiting the highest ETPA cross section. DFT calculations suggest that this difference might stem from the interaction of entangled photons with lower-lying electronic states in the all-cis PPV variant. Additionally, we explored the photoinduced processes for both cis and trans PPVs through time-resolved fluorescence upconversion and femtosecond transient absorption techniques. This study revealed that the sensitivity of PPVs in two-photon absorption varies with classical versus quantum light and can be modulated through the control of the geometry of the repeating alkenes, which is a key stepping stone toward their use in quantum sensing, bioimaging, and the design of polymer-based light-harvesting systems.

TI Interfacial phonon engineering in 2D heterostructures for cavity-less
   optomechanical systems
SO JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYSICS
AB Two-dimensional materials such as graphene are expected to emerge as crucial platforms for on-chip integrated optomechanical systems due to their atomic-scale thickness, strong light-matter coupling, and tunable mechanical properties. However, conventional cavity optomechanical systems are constrained by low-temperature requirements and complex optical cavity configurations. Through interfacial engineering of van der Waals heterostructures and innovative design of phononic sensing layers, we have achieved an optical cavity-less excitonic optomechanical system operating at room temperature that combines high-frequency oscillatory characteristics with high quality factors. Picosecond ultrasonic pump-probe spectroscopy reveals photoinduced carrier-driven out-of-plane longitudinal coherent phonon dynamics in few and multilayer graphene, where electron-phonon coupling enhances optomechanical interactions. Systematic investigation of phonon dissipation mechanisms in supporting substrates ( Si, sapphire, hBN, freestanding) identifies phonon radiative losses as the dominant factor, with substrate-free systems extending resonant phonon lifetimes from 58 to 201 ps. We propose utilizing exciton-phonon coupling in MoS2 sensing layers to effectively detect phonon pulses, ultimately achieving a characteristic f x Q product of 1.87 x 10 (13 )Hz that surpasses the quantum sensing threshold ( > 6 x 10 (12) Hz) at room temperature. This work demonstrates that 2D heterostructures can replace physical cavities through exciton-phonon coupling to achieve phonon field localization, establishing an "exciton-resonance equivalent cavity" with enhanced acousto-optic coupling. These findings provide new strategies for quantum sensing, on-chip acoustic resonators, and non-destructive material characterization. (c) 2025 Author(s).

TI Error-mitigated photonic variational quantum eigensolver using a
   single-photon ququart
SO OPTICA
AB Variational quantum algorithms, a representative class of modern quantum algorithms, provide practical uses of near-term quantum processors. The size of the problem that can be encoded and solved on a quantum processor is limited by the dimension of the Hilbert space associated with the processor. One common approach for increasing the system dimension is to utilize a larger number of quantum systems. Here, we adopt an alternative approach to utilize multiple degrees of freedom of individual quantum systems to experimentally resource-efficiently increase the Hilbert space. We report experimental implementation of the variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) using four-dimensional photonic quantum states of single photons. The four-dimensional quantum states are implemented by utilizing polarization and path degrees of freedom of a single photon. Our photonic VQE is equipped with a quantum error mitigation protocol that efficiently reduces the effects of Pauli noise in the quantum processing unit. We apply our photonic VQE to estimate the ground state energy of the He - H+ cation. Simulation and experimental results demonstrate that our experimental resource-efficient photonic VQE can accurately estimate the bond dissociation curve, even in the presence of large noise in the quantum processing unit. We also discuss further possible resource-efficient enhancement of the Hilbert space in photonic quantum processors. Our results propose that photonic systems utilizing multiple degrees of freedom can provide a resource-efficient avenue to implement practical near-term quantum processors.

TI Thermalization and criticality on an analogue-digital quantum simulator
SO NATURE
AB Understanding how interacting particles approach thermal equilibrium is a major challenge of quantum simulators(1,2). Unlocking the full potential of such systems towards this goal requires flexible initial state preparation, precise time evolution and extensive probes for final state characterization. Here we present a quantum simulator comprising 69 superconducting qubits that supports both universal quantum gates and high-fidelity analogue evolution, with performance beyond the reach of classical simulation in cross-entropy benchmarking experiments. This hybrid platform features more versatile measurement capabilities compared with analogue-only simulators, which we leverage here to reveal a coarsening-induced breakdown of Kibble-Zurek scaling predictions(3) in the XY model, as well as signatures of the classical Kosterlitz-Thouless phase transition(4). Moreover, the digital gates enable precise energy control, allowing us to study the effects of the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis(5-7) in targeted parts of the eigenspectrum. We also demonstrate digital preparation of pairwise-entangled dimer states, and image the transport of energy and vorticity during subsequent thermalization in analogue evolution. These results establish the efficacy of superconducting analogue-digital quantum processors for preparing states across many-body spectra and unveiling their thermalization dynamics.

AB The Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) has been one of the leading candidates for near-term quantum advantage in gate-model quantum computers. From its inception, this algorithm has sparked the desire for comparison between gate-model and annealing platforms. When preparing problem statements for these algorithms, the predominant inclination has been to formulate a quadratic Hamiltonian. This paper gives an example of a graph coloring problem that, depending on its variable encoding scheme, optionally admits higher order terms. This paper presents evidence that the higher order formulation is preferable to two other encoding schemes. The evidence then motivates an analysis of the scaling behavior of QAOA in this higher order formulation for an ensemble of graph coloring problems.

TI Evolution of room-temperature magnon gas: Toward a coherent
   Bose-Einstein condensate
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
AB The appearance of spontaneous coherence is a fundamental feature of a Bose-Einstein condensate and an essential requirement for possible applications of the condensates for data processing and quantum computing. In the case of a magnon condensate in a magnetic crystal, such computing can be performed even at room temperature. We study the process of the formation of a coherent magnon condensate by direct detection of microwave radiation emitted by magnons in a parametrically driven yttrium iron garnet bulk sample of a special shape. We show that after switching off the parametric pumping, the overpopulated magnon gas evolves to a state, whose coherence is only limited by the natural magnon relaxation into the crystal lattice.

TI Beating the Natural Grover Bound for Low-Energy Estimation and State
   Preparation
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB Estimating ground state energies of many-body Hamiltonians is a central task in many areas of quantum physics. In this Letter, we give quantum algorithms which, given any k-body Hamiltonian H, compute an estimate for the ground state energy and prepare a quantum state achieving said energy, respectively. Specifically, for any epsilon > 0, our algorithms return, with high probability, an estimate of the ground state energy of H within additive error epsilon M, or a quantum state with the corresponding energy. Here, M is the total strength of all interaction terms, which in general is extensive in the system size. Our approach makes no assumptions about the geometry or spatial locality of interaction terms of the input Hamiltonian and thus handles even long-range or all-to-all interactions, such as in quantum chemistry, where lattice-based techniques break down. In this fully general setting, the run-time of our algorithms scales as 2cn/2 for c < 1, yielding the first quantum algorithms for low-energy estimation breaking a standard square root Grover speedup for unstructured search. The core of our approach is remarkably simple, and relies on showing that an extensive fraction of the interactions can be neglected with a controlled error. What this ultimately implies is that even arbitrary k-local Hamiltonians have structure in their low energy space, in the form of an exponential-dimensional low energy subspace.

TI Adaptive variational quantum eigensolvers for highly excited states
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
AB Highly excited states of quantum many-body systems are central objects in the study of quantum dynamics and thermalization that challenge classical computational methods due to their volume-law entanglement content. In this work, we explore the potential of variational quantum algorithms to approximate such states. We propose an adaptive variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) for excited states (X) that self-generates a variational ansatz for arbitrary eigenstates of a many-body Hamiltonian H by attempting to minimize the energy variance with respect to H. We benchmark the method by applying it to an Ising spin chain with integrable and nonintegrable regimes, where we calculate various quantities of interest, including the total energy, magnetization density, and entanglement entropy. We also compare the performance of adaptive VQE-X to an adaptive variant of the folded-spectrum method. For both methods, we find a strong dependence of the algorithm's performance on the choice of operator pool used for the adaptive construction of the ansatz. In particular, an operator pool including long-range two-body gates accelerates the convergence of both algorithms in the nonintegrable regime. We also study the scaling of the number of variational parameters with system size, finding that an exponentially large number of parameters may be necessary to approximate individual highly excited states. Nevertheless, we argue that these methods lay a foundation for the use of quantum algorithms to study finite-energy-density properties of many-body systems.

TI Neural-network-based transfer learning for predicting cryo-CMOS
   characteristics from small datasets
SO APPLIED PHYSICS EXPRESS
AB Transfer learning was examined to predict current-voltage (I-V) characteristics of MOSFETs at cryogenic temperatures. An experimental dataset was obtained from approximately 800 silicon-on-insulator MOSFETs using an automated cryogenic wafer prober to pre-train a 3-hidden-layer neural network (NN) model. Transfer learning based on the NN model was then conducted using another small dataset from 2 bulk MOSFETs. The transfer learning NN model predicted more realistic I-V characteristics and threshold voltages than a control NN model trained using only the small dataset. This study demonstrates cryogenic MOSFET characteristics prediction from a small dataset to reduce time and financial costs for developing cryo-CMOS devices.

AB A Mach-Zehnder interferometer with an optical phase control by a twisted nematic (TN) liquid crystal (LC) device was studied. In a typical TN LC device, a change in the optical rotation state of pi/2 can be obtained by applying a voltage of about 5 V with a cell thickness of several-micron. The TN cell is inserted into one optical path in the Mach-Zehnder interferometer. We obtained a pattern change when voltage was applied to the LC cell due to the change of the optical interference state. As a result, a change in the number of photons under weak light conditions is observed.

TI NMR for Single Ion Magnets

AB Nuclear Magnetic Resonance is particularly sensitive to the electronic structure of matter and is thus a powerful tool to characterize in-depth the magnetic properties of a system. NMR is indeed increasingly recognized as an ideal tool to add precious structural information for the development of Single Ion Magnets, small complexes that are recently gaining much popularity due to their quantum computing and spintronics applications. In this review, we recall the theoretical principles of paramagnetic NMR, with particular attention to lanthanoids, and we give an overview of the recent advances in this field.

We investigate molecular precursor adsorption into self-assembled single-dimer window (SDW) adsorption sites formed on Si(100) with density functional theory (DFT). Several relevant dopant precursor (PH3, BCl3, AlCl3, GaCl3) and resist (H, Cl, Br, I) combinations are explored. PH3 adsorbed without barrier on all resists studied, while BCl3 exhibited the largest adsorption barrier, 0.34 eV, with an I resist. Dense arrays of AlCl3 formed within experimentally realizable conditions demonstrating the potential impact of this approach.

TI Quantum expectation-value estimation by computational basis sampling
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Measuring expectation values of observables is an essential ingredient in variational quantum algorithms. A practical obstacle is the necessity of a large number of measurements for statistical convergence to meet requirements of precision, such as chemical accuracy in the application to quantum chemistry computations. Here we propose an algorithm to estimate the expectation value based on its approximate expression as a weighted sum of classically tractable matrix elements with some modulation, where the weight and modulation factors are evaluated by sampling appropriately prepared quantum states in the computational basis on quantum computers. Each of those states is prepared by applying a unitary transformation consisting of at most N CNOT gates, where N is the number of qubits, to a target quantum state whose expectation value is evaluated. Our algorithm is expected to require fewer measurements than conventional methods for a required statistical precision of the expectation value when the target quantum state is concentrated in particular computational basis states. We provide numerical comparisons of our method with existing ones for measuring electronic ground-state energies (expectation values of electronic Hamiltonians for the lowest-energy states) of various small molecules. Numerical results show that our method can reduce the numbers of measurements to obtain the ground-state energies for a targeted precision by several orders of magnitudes for molecules whose ground states are concentrated. Our results provide another route to measure expectation values of observables, which could accelerate the variational quantum algorithms.

SO PHYSICAL REVIEW APPLIED
AB Microwave-to-optical transducers are integral to the future of superconducting quantum computing, as they would enable scaling and long-distance communication of superconducting quantum processors through optical-fiber links. However, optically induced microwave noise poses a significant challenge in achieving quantum transduction between microwave and optical frequencies. In this work, we study light-induced microwave noise in an integrated electro-optical transducer harnessing the Pockels effect of thin-film lithium niobate. We reveal three sources of added noise with distinctive time constants ranging from sub-100 ns to milliseconds. Our results provide insights into the mechanisms and corresponding mitigation strategies for light-induced microwave noise in superconducting microwave-optical transducers and pave the way toward realizing the ultimate goal of quantum transduction.

TI Non-ergodic one-magnon magnetization dynamics of the Kagome lattice
   antiferromagnet
SO ZEITSCHRIFT FUR NATURFORSCHUNG SECTION A-A JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL SCIENCES
AB The present view of modern physics on non-equilibrium dynamics is that generic systems equilibrate or thermalize under rather general conditions, even closed systems under unitary time evolution. The investigation of exceptions thus not only appears attractive, in view of quantum computing where thermalization is a threat it also seems to be necessary. Here, we present aspects of the one-magnon dynamics on the Kagome lattice antiferromagnet as an example of a non-equilibrating dynamics due to flat bands. Similar to the one-dimensional delta chain localized eigenstates also called localized magnons lead to disorder-free localization and prevent the system from equilibration.

SO PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACM ON PROGRAMMING LANGUAGES-PACMPL
AB It is well-known that quantum programs are not only complicated to design but also challenging to verify because the quantum states can have exponential size and require sophisticated mathematics to encode and manipulate. To tackle the state-space explosion problem for quantum reasoning, we propose a Hoare-style inference framework that supports local reasoning for quantum programs. By providing a quantum interpretation of the separating conjunction, we are able to infuse separation logic into our framework and apply local reasoning using a quantum frame rule that is similar to the classical frame rule. For evaluation, we apply our framework to verify various quantum programs including DeutschsJozsa's algorithm and Grover's algorithm.

AB Classical shadow tomography provides a randomized scheme for approximating the quantum state and its properties at reduced computational cost with applications in quantum computing. In this Letter we present an algorithm for realizing fewer measurements in the shadow tomography of many-body systems. Accelerated tomography of the two-body reduced density matrix (2-RDM) is achieved by combining classical shadows with necessary constraints for the 2-RDM to represent an N-body system, known as N-representability conditions. We compute the ground-state energies and 2-RDMs of hydrogen chains and the N2 dissociation curve. The results demonstrate a significant reduction in the number of measurements with important applications to quantum many-body simulations on near-term quantum devices.

TI Sparse-Hamiltonian approach to the time-evolution of molecules on
   quantum computers
SO EUROPEAN PHYSICAL JOURNAL-SPECIAL TOPICS
AB Quantum chemistry has been viewed as one of the potential early applications of quantum computing. Two techniques have been proposed for electronic structure calculations: (1) the variational quantum eigensolver and (2) the phase-estimation algorithm. In both cases, the complexity of the problem increases for basis sets where either the Hamiltonian is not sparse, or it is sparse, but many orbitals are required to accurately describe the molecule of interest. In this work, we explore the possibility of mapping the molecular problem onto a sparse Hubbard-like Hamiltonian, which allows a Green's-function-based approach to electronic structure via a hybrid quantum-classical algorithm. We illustrate the time-evolution aspect of this methodology with a simple four-site hydrogen ring.

TI Multi-impurity chiral Kondo model: Correlation functions and anyon
   fusion rules
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
AB The multichannel Kondo model supports effective anyons on the partially screened impurity, as suggested by its fractional impurity entropy. It was recently demonstrated for the multi-impurity chiral Kondo model, that scattering of an electron through the impurities depends on the anyon's total fusion channel. Here we study the correlation between impurity spins. We argue, based on a combination of conformal field theory, a perturbative limit with a large number of channels k, and the exactly solvable two-channel case, that the interimpurity spin correlation probes the anyon fusion of the pair of correlated impurities. This may allow, using measurement-only topological quantum computing protocols, to braid the multichannel Kondo anyons via consecutive measurements.

TI Systematic many-fermion Hamiltonian input scheme and spectral
   calculations on quantum computers
SO PHYSICS LETTERS B
AB We present a novel input scheme for general second-quantized Hamiltonians of relativistic or non-relativistic many-fermion systems. This input scheme incorporates the fermionic anticommutation relations, particle number variations, and respects the symmetries of the Hamiltonian. Based on our input scheme, we propose a hybrid quantum-classical framework for spectral calculations on future quantum hardwares. We provide explicit circuit designs and the associated gate cost. We demonstrate our hybrid framework by solving the low-lying spectra of 42Ca and 46Ca. Our input scheme provides new pathways to solving the spectra and dynamics of the relativistic and nonrelativistic many-fermion systems via first-principles approaches.

AB The Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) represents a significant opportunity for practical quantum computing applications, particularly in the era before error correction is fully realized. This algorithm is especially relevant for addressing constraint satisfaction problems (CSPs), which are critical in various fields such as supply chain management, energy distribution, and financial modeling. In our study, we conduct a numerical comparison of three different strategies for incorporating linear constraints into QAOA: transforming them into an unconstrained format, introducing penalty dephasing, and utilizing the quantum Zeno effect. We assess the efficiency and effectiveness of these methods using the knapsack problem as a case study. Our findings provide insights into the potential applicability of different encoding methods for various use cases.

TI Variational benchmarks for quantum many-body problems
SO SCIENCE
AB The continued development of computational approaches to many-body ground-state problems in physics and chemistry calls for a consistent way to assess its overall progress. In this work, we introduce a metric of variational accuracy, the V-score, obtained from the variational energy and its variance. We provide an extensive curated dataset of variational calculations of many-body quantum systems, identifying cases where state-of-the-art numerical approaches show limited accuracy and future algorithms or computational platforms, such as quantum computing, could provide improved accuracy. The V-score can be used as a metric to assess the progress of quantum variational methods toward a quantum advantage for ground-state problems, especially in regimes where classical verifiability is impossible.

TI Long-Lived Coherence on a μHz Scale Optical Magnetic Quadrupole
   Transition
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB We report on the coherent excitation of the ultranarrow 1S0-3P2 magnetic quadrupole transition in 88Sr. By confining atoms in a state insensitive optical lattice, we achieve excitation fractions of 97(1)% and observe linewidths as narrow as 58(1) Hz. With Ramsey spectroscopy, we find coherence times of 14(1) ms, which can be extended to 266(36) ms using a spin-echo sequence. We determine the lifetime of the 3P2 level for spontaneous emission of magnetic quadrupole radiation to be 110(31) min, confirming long-standing theoretical predictions. These results establish an additional clock transition in strontium and pave the way for applications of the metastable 3P2 state in quantum computing and quantum simulations.

TI Quantum-controlled cluster states
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Quantum optical cluster states have been increasingly explored in the light of their importance for measurement-based quantum computing. Here we set forth a method for generating quantum controlled cluster states: pumping an optical parametric oscillator with spatially structured light. We show that state-of-the-art techniques for producing clusters in the spectral and temporal domains are improved by a structured light pump, which manipulates the spatial mode couplings in the parametric interaction. We illustrate the method considering a second-order pump structure and show that a simple mode rotation yields different cluster states, including but not limited to the two-dimensional square and hexagonal lattices. We also introduce a novel technique for generating nonuniform cluster states and propose a simple setup for its implementation.

One drawback of the QSVT algorithm is that it requires huge quantum resources if we want to achieve an acceptable accuracy. To reduce the quantum cost, we propose a hybrid quantum-classical algorithm that improves the accuracy and reduces the cost of the QSVT by adding iterative refinement in mixed-precision A first quantum solution is computed using the QSVT, in low precision, and then refined in higher precision until we get a satisfactory accuracy. For this solver, we present an error and complexity analysis, and first experiments using the quantum software stack myQLM.

TI Quantum Bloom Filter and Its Applications
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON QUANTUM ENGINEERING
AB A quantum Bloom filter is a spatially more efficient data structure which is used to represent a set of n elements by using O(lognk) qubits. In this article, we define and design a quantum Bloom filter and its corresponding algorithms. Due to the reversibility of quantum operators, it can not only add a new element to a quantum Bloom filter but also delete an existing element from the quantum Bloom filter. Furthermore, we employ the quantum Bloom filter to solve two private issues, i.e., oblivious set-member decision and multiparty private set intersection cardinality. The results show that the quantum Bloom filter has inherent advantages in privacy-preserving applications concerning set operations.

AB NbN thin films are considered as a promising alternative candidate to conventional Al superconducting electrodes for Josephson junction devices, superconducting qubits and quantum logic circuits. Herein, by co-growing ferromagnetic Co with superconducting NbN, self-assembled NbN-Co vertically aligned nanocomposite (VAN) thin films have been successfully deposited on a MgO substrates, with NbN in its cubic superconducting phase. The obtained VAN metamaterials exhibit epitaxial growth of NbN with uniformly dispersed Co nanoplates. Further physical property characterization reveals that the NbN-Co VAN presents ferromagnet properties with strong out-of-plane magnetic anisotropy and optical anisotropy. This hybrid metamaterial system could find future applications in superconducting spintronic devices and quantum computing devices.

TI Provably Secure Lattice-Based Self-Certified Signature Scheme
SO SECURITY AND COMMUNICATION NETWORKS
AB Digital signatures are crucial network security technologies. However, in traditional public key signature schemes, the certificate management is complicated and the schemes are vulnerable to public key replacement attacks. In order to solve the problems, in this paper, we propose a self-certified signature scheme over lattice. Using the self-certified public key, our scheme allows a user to certify the public key without an extra certificate. It can reduce the communication overhead and computational cost of the signature scheme. Moreover, the lattice helps prevent quantum computing attacks. Then, based on the small integer solution problem, our scheme is provable secure in the random oracle model. Furthermore, compared with the previous self-certified signature schemes, our scheme is more secure.

CL Lyon, FRANCE
AB Given a random function f with domain [2(n)] and codomain [2(m)], with m >= n, a collision of f is a pair of distinct inputs with the same image. Collision finding is an ubiquitous problem in cryptanalysis, and it has been well studied using both classical and quantum algorithms. Indeed, the quantum query complexity of the problem is well known to be Theta(2(m/3)), and matching algorithms are known for any value of m.
   The situation becomes different when one is looking for multiple collision pairs. Here, for 2k collisions, a query lower bound of Theta(2((2k+m)/3)) was shown by Liu and Zhandry (EUROCRYPT 2019). A matching algorithm is known, but only for relatively small values of m, when many collisions exist. In this paper, we improve the algorithms for this problem and, in particular, extend the range of admissible parameters where the lower bound is met.
   Our new method relies on a chained quantum walk algorithm, which might be of independent interest. It allows to extract multiple solutions of an MNRS-style quantum walk, without having to recompute it entirely: after finding and outputting a solution, the current state is reused as the initial state of another walk.
   As an application, we improve the quantum sieving algorithms for the shortest vector problem (SVP), with a complexity of 2(0.2563d+o(d)) instead of the previous 2(0.2570d+o(d)).

TI Trapping Electrons in a Room-Temperature Microwave Paul Trap
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW X
AB We demonstrate trapping of electrons in a millimeter-sized quadrupole Paul trap driven at 1.6 GHz in a room-temperature ultrahigh vacuum setup. Cold electrons are introduced into the trap by ionization of atomic calcium via Rydberg states and stay confined by microwave and static electric fields for several tens of milliseconds. A fraction of these electrons remain trapped longer and show no measurable loss for measurement times up to a second. Electronic excitation of the motion reveals secular frequencies that can be tuned over a range of several tens to hundreds of MHz. Operating a similar electron Paul trap in a cryogenic environment may provide a platform for all-electric quantum computing with trapped electron spin qubits.

AB Opto-spintronics is an emerging field that focuses on harnessing light to manipulate and analyze electron spins to develop next-generation electronic devices. This paper explores recent progress and the role of solid-state materials in opto-spintronics by focusing on key classes of materials, such as ferromagnetic semiconductors, two-dimensional (2D) transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs), and topological insulators. It examines the unique properties of ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic materials and their ability to interact with light to affect spin dynamics, offering potential for improved sensing and quantum computing. By combining opto-spintronics with solid-state systems, spintronic devices could become faster and more efficient, leading to new technological advancements and scalable technologies.

TI A Blockchain Consensus Protocol Based on Quantum Attack Algorithm
SO COMPUTATIONAL INTELLIGENCE AND NEUROSCIENCE
AB The blockchain is a distributed storage system of digital assets. This decentralized, non-copyable technology stems from universal standard password algorithm and the consensus mechanism of the game theory. The development of quantum computing poses threat to traditional algorithms of blockchain encryption, including symmetric encryption and hash encryption. Focusing on the traditional blockchain consensus mechanism, this paper designs a new blockchain consensus mechanism, based on the stochasticity, irreversibility, and uncertainty of quantum measurement. In the proposed consensus mechanism, complex calculations and intractability mathematical problems are abandoned. In this way, a huge amount of computing resources is saved, less energy is consumed, the time delay is shortened, and the throughput is increased. The proposed quantum consensus mechanism can withstand 51% attacks.

TI Enhanced Quantum Metrology with Non-Phase-Covariant Noise
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB The detrimental impact of noise on sensing performance in quantum metrology has been widely recognized by researchers in the field. However, there are no explicit fundamental laws of physics stating that noise invariably weakens quantum metrology. We reveal that phase-covariant noise either degrades or remains neutral to sensing precision, whereas non-phase-covariant noise can potentially enhance parameter estimation, surpassing even the ultimate precision limit achievable in the absence of noise. This implies that a non-Hermitian quantum sensor may outperform its Hermitian counterpart in terms of sensing performance. To illustrate and validate our theory, we present several paradigmatic examples of magnetic field metrology.

TI Robust self-testing of steerable quantum assemblages and its
   applications on device-independent quantum certification
SO QUANTUM
AB Given a Bell inequality, if its maximal quantum violation can be achieved only by a single set of measurements for each party or a single quantum state, up to local unitaries, one refers to such a phenomenon as self-testing. For instance, the maximal quantum violation of the Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt (CHSH) inequality certifies that the underlying state contains the two-qubit maximally entangled state and the measurements of one party (say, Alice) contains a pair of anti-commuting qubit observables. As a consequence, the other party (say, Bob) automatically verifies his set of states remotely steered by Alice, namely the assemblage, is in the eigenstates of a pair of anti-commuting observables. It is natural to ask if the quantum violation of the Bell inequality is not maximally achieved, or if one does not care about self-testing the state or measurements, are we capable of estimating how close the underlying assemblage is to the reference one? In this work, we provide a systematic device-independent estimation by proposing a framework called robust self-testing of steerable quantum assemblages. In particular, we consider assemblages violating several paradigmatic Bell inequalities and obtain the robust self-testing statement for each scenario. Our result is deviceindependent (DI), i.e., no assumption is made on the shared state and the measurement devices involved. Our work thus not only paves a way for exploring the connection between the boundary of quantum set of correlations and steerable assemblages, but also provides a useful tool in the areas of device-independent quantum certification. As two explicit applications, we show 1) that it can be used for an alternative proof of the protocol of DI certification of all entangled twoqubit states proposed by Bowles et al. [Phys. Rev. Lett. 121, 180503 (2018)], and 2) that it can be used to verify all non-entanglement-breaking qubit channels with fewer assumptions compared with the work of Rosset et al. [Phys. Rev. X 8, 021033 (2018)].

TI SU(2) lattice gauge theory on a quantum annealer
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW D
AB Lattice gauge theory is an essential tool for strongly interacting non-Abelian fields, such as those in quantum chromodynamics where lattice results have been of central importance for several decades. Recent studies suggest that quantum computers could extend the reach of lattice gauge theory in dramatic ways, but the usefulness of quantum annealing hardware for lattice gauge theory has not yet been explored. In this work, we implement SU(2) pure gauge theory on a quantum annealer for lattices comprising a few plaquettes in a row with a periodic boundary condition. These plaquettes are in two spatial dimensions and calculations use the Hamiltonian formulation where time is not discretized. Numerical results are obtained from calculations on D-Wave Advantage hardware for eigenvalues, eigenvectors, vacuum expectation values, and time evolution. The success of this initial exploration indicates that the quantum annealer might become a useful hardware platform for some aspects of lattice gauge theories.

TI Continuous-variables cluster states in photonic time-crystals
SO OPTICA QUANTUM
AB Photonic quantum computing has been rapidly advancing over the past decade, with measurement-based approaches emerging as particularly promising. A crucial requirement for these approaches is the generation of large-scale cluster states. In this work, we present a method to create cluster states using Photonic Time Crystals (PTCs)-dielectric materials with their refractive index rapidly modulated in time. PTCs effectively function as a set of optical parametric oscillators and beam-splitters, producing simultaneous two-mode squeezing for many pairs of photonic modes with opposite wavevectors. We utilize this capability to propose a method for generating two-dimensional cluster states, offering important advantages over existing protocols.

While beneficial, they also challenge the security of traditional cryptographic systems. Quantum computing threatens RSA and ECC with algorithms like Shor's algorithm, which can accelerate computations exponentially.

AB It is known that computing the permanent of the matrix 1 + A, where A is a finite-rank matrix, requires a number of operations polynomial in the matrix size. Motivated by the boson-sampling proposal of restricted quantum computation, I extend this result to a generalization of the matrix permanent: An expectation value in a product of a large number of identical bosonic states with a bounded number of bosons. This result complements earlier studies on the computational complexity in boson sampling and related setups. The proposed technique based on the Gaussian averaging is equally applicable to bosonic and fermionic systems. This also allows us to improve an earlier polynomial complexity estimate for the fermionic version of the same problem.

   Dirac semimetallic silicides
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Superconductors with broken time-reversal symmetry represent arguably one of the most promising venues for realizing highly sought-after topological superconductivity that is vital to fault-tolerant quantum computation. Here, by using extensive muon-spin relaxation and rotation measurements, we report that the isostructural silicide superconductors (Ta, Nb)OsSi spontaneously break time-reversal symmetry at the superconducting transition while surprisingly showing a fully gapped superconductivity characteristic of conventional superconductors. The first-principles calculations show that (Ta, Nb)OsSi are three-dimensional Dirac semimetals protected by nonsymmorphic symmetries. Taking advantage of the exceptional low symmetry crystal structure of these materials, we have performed detailed theoretical calculations to establish that the superconducting ground state for both (Ta, Nb)OsSi is most likely a nonunitary triplet state.

Suitable Ising problems, however, need to be formulated such that they, on the one hand, respect the specific restrictions of the hardware and, on the other hand, represent the original problems which shall actually be solved. We evaluate sufficient requirements on such an embedded Ising problem analytically and transform them into a linear optimization problem. With an objective function aiming to minimize the maximal absolute problem parameter, the precision issues of the annealers are addressed. Due to the redundancy of several constraints, we can show that the formally exponentially large optimization problem can be reduced and finally solved in polynomial time for the standard embedding setting where the embedded vertices induce trees. This allows to formulate provably equivalent embedded Ising problems in a practical setup.

TI Tighter monogamy inequalities of multiqubit entanglement
SO LASER PHYSICS LETTERS
AB Multipartite entanglement holds great importance in quantum information processing. The distribution of entanglement among subsystems can be characterized by monogamy relations. Based on the beta th power of concurrence and negativity, we provide two new monogamy inequalities. Through detailed examples, we demonstrate that these inequalities are tighter than previous results.

TI Isotopic enrichment of silicon by high fluence
   28Si- ion implantation
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW MATERIALS
AB Spins in the "semiconductor vacuum" of silicon-28 (Si-28) are suitable qubit candidates due to their long coherence times. An isotopically purified substrate or epilayer of Si-28 is required to limit the decoherence pathway caused by magnetic perturbations from surrounding Si-29 nuclear spins (I = 1/2), present in natural Si (Si-nat) at an abundance of 4.67%. We isotopically enrich surface layers of Si-nat by sputtering using high fluence Si-28(-) implantation. Phosphorus (P) donors implanted into one such Si-28 layer with similar to 3000 ppm Si-29, produced by implanting 30 keV Si-28(-) ions at a fluence of 4 x 10(18) cm(-2), were measured with pulsed electron spin resonance, confirming successful donor activation upon annealing. The monoexponential decay of the Hahn echo signal indicates a depletion of Si-29. A coherence time of T-2 = 285 +/- 14 mu s is extracted, which is longer than that obtained in Si-nat for similar doping concentrations and can be increased by reducing the P concentration in the future. Guided by simulations, the isotopic enrichment was improved by employing one-for-one ion sputtering using 45 keV Si-28(-) implanted with a fluence of 2.63 x 10(18) cm(-2) into Si-nat. This resulted in an isotopically enriched surface layer similar to 100 nm thick, suitable for providing a sufficient volume of Si-28 for donor qubits implanted into the near-surface region. We observe a depletion of Si-29 to 250 ppm as measured by secondary ion mass spectrometry. The impurity content and the crystallization kinetics via solid phase epitaxy are discussed. The Si-28 layer is confirmed to be a single crystal using transmission electron microscopy. This method of Si isotopic enrichment shows promise for incorporation into the fabrication process flow of Si spin-qubit devices.

TI Homogeneous linear ion crystal in a hybrid potential
SO QUANTUM INFORMATION PROCESSING
AB We investigate the properties of a linear ion crystal in a combination of quadratic and quartic potentials. Both the discrete and the continuous models are employed to explore the homogeneity of a linear ion crystal by tuning the proportional parameter between the quadratic and quartic components. It is found that the size of the uniform region is significantly larger than that in either a purely quadratic or a quartic potential. The zigzag transition is also investigated in the hybrid potential, and its critical condition and phase diagram are determined numerically, which agrees well with previous theoretical and experimental results. Our results pave the way for experimental investigation of superlarge linear ion crystals in the combination of quadratic and quartic potentials.

TI Chirality-selective proximity effect between chiral p-wave
   superconductors and quantum Hall insulators
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
AB Heterostructures of superconductors and quantum-Hall insulators are promising platforms for topological quantum computation. However, these two systems are incompatible in some aspects, such as a strong magnetic field, the Meissner effect, and chirality. In this work, we address the condition that the superconducting proximity effect works in the bulk of quantum Hall states, and identify an essential role played by the vortex lattice regardless of pairing symmetry. We extend this finding to a heterostructure between a chiral p-wave superconductor in the mixed state and an integer quantum Hall insulator. The proximity effect works selectively in the lowest Landau level, depending on relative chiralities. If the chiralities align, a topological phase transition to a topological superconductor occurs.

TI Scalable measurement error mitigation via iterative bayesian unfolding
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Measurement errors are a significant obstacle to achieving scalable quantum computation. To counteract systematic readout errors, researchers have developed postprocessing techniques known as measurement error mitigation methods. However, these methods face a tradeoff between scalability and returning nonnegative probabilities. In this paper, we present a solution to overcome this challenge. Our approach focuses on iterative Bayesian unfolding, a standard mitigation technique used in high-energy physics experiments, and implements it in a scalable way. We demonstrate our method on experimental Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger state preparation on up to 127 qubits and on the Bernstein-Vazirani algorithm on up to 26 qubits. Compared to state-of-the-art methods (such as M3), our implementation guarantees valid probability distributions, returns comparable or better -mitigated results, and does so without a noticeable time and memory overhead.

TI Novel Quantum Sensors for Light Dark Matter and Neutrino Detection
SO ANNUAL REVIEW OF NUCLEAR AND PARTICLE SCIENCE
AB The fields of light dark matter and neutrino physics offer compelling signals at recoil energies of eV to even meV, well below the greater than or similar to keV thresholds of many techniques currently employed in these fields. Sensing of such small energies can benefit from the emergence of so-called quantum sensors, which employ fundamentally quantum mechanical phenomena to transduce energy depositions into electrical signals. This review focuses on quantum sensors under development that will enhance and extend the search for "particle-like" interactions of dark matter or enable new measurements of neutrino properties in the coming years.

TI Embedding Quantum Program Verification into Dafny
SO PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACM ON PROGRAMMING LANGUAGES-PACMPL
AB Despite recent development of quantum program verification, it is still in its early stage, where many quantum programs are hard to verify due to their inherent probabilistic nature and parallelism in quantum superposition. We propose Qafnyc, a system that compiles quantum program verification into a well-established classical program verifier Dafny, enabling the formal verification of quantum programs. The key insight behind Qafnyc is the separation of quantum program verification from its execution, leveraging the strength of classical verifiers to ensure correctness before compiling certified quantum programs into executable circuits. Using Qafnyc, we have successfully verified 37 diverse quantum programs by compiling their verification into Dafny. To the best of our knowledge, this is the most extensive formally verified set of quantum programs.

TI Quantifying quantum coherence of optical cat states
SO PHOTONICS RESEARCH
AB The optical cat state plays an essential role in quantum computation and quantum metrology. Here, we experimentally quantify quantum coherence of an optical cat state by means of relative entropy and the l(1) norm of coherence in a Fock basis based on the prepared optical cat state at the rubidium D1 line. By transmitting the optical cat state through a lossy channel, we also demonstrate the robustness of quantum coherence of the optical cat state in the presence of loss, which is different from the decoherence properties of fidelity and Wigner function negativity of the optical cat state. Our results confirm that quantum coherence of optical cat states is robust against loss and pave the way for the application of optical cat states. (C) 2021 Chinese Laser Press

TI Demonstration of Weighted-Graph Optimization on a Rydberg-Atom Array
   Using Local Light Shifts
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB Neutral-atom arrays have emerged as a versatile platform toward scalable quantum computation and optimization. In this paper, we present demonstrations of solving maximum-weighted independent-set problems on a Rydberg-atom array using annealing with local light shifts. We verify the ability to prepare weighted graphs in one-dimensional (1D) and two-dimensional (2D) arrays, including embedding a five- vertex nonunit-disk graph using nine physical qubits and demonstration of a simple crossing gadget. We find common annealing ramps leading to preparation of the target ground state robustly over a substantial range of different graph weightings. This work provides a route to exploring large-scale optimization of nonplanar weighted graphs relevant for solving relevant real-world problems.

TI AI-Driven Framework for Secure and Efficient Load Management in
   Multi-Station EV Charging Networks
SO WORLD ELECTRIC VEHICLE JOURNAL
AB This research introduces a comprehensive AI-driven framework for secure and efficient load management in multi-station electric vehicle (EV) charging networks, responding to the increasing demand and operational difficulties associated with widespread EV adoption. The suggested architecture has three main parts: a Smart Load Balancer (SLB), an AI-driven intrusion detection system (AIDS), and a Real-Time Analytics Engine (RAE). These parts use advanced machine learning methods like Support Vector Machines (SVMs), autoencoders, and reinforcement learning (RL) to make the system more flexible, secure, and efficient. The framework uses federated learning (FL) to protect data privacy and make decisions in a decentralized way, which lowers the risks that come with centralizing data. The framework makes load distribution 23.5% more efficient, cuts average wait time by 17.8%, and predicts station-level demand with 94.2% accuracy, according to simulation results. The AI-based intrusion detection component has precision, recall, and F1-scores that are all over 97%, which is better than standard methods. The study also finds important gaps in the current literature and suggests new areas for research, such as using graph neural networks (GNNs) and quantum machine learning to make EV charging infrastructures even more scalable, resilient, and intelligent.

TI A Survey of Recent Advances in Quantum Generative Adversarial Networks
SO ELECTRONICS
AB Quantum mechanics studies nature and its behavior at the scale of atoms and subatomic particles. By applying quantum mechanics, a lot of problems can be solved in a more convenient way thanks to its special quantum properties, such as superposition and entanglement. In the current noisy intermediate-scale quantum era, quantum mechanics finds its use in various fields of life. Following this trend, researchers seek to augment machine learning in a quantum way. The generative adversarial network (GAN), an important machine learning invention that excellently solves generative tasks, has also been extended with quantum versions. Since the first publication of a quantum GAN (QuGAN) in 2018, many QuGAN proposals have been suggested. A QuGAN may have a fully quantum or a hybrid quantum-classical architecture, which may need additional data processing in the quantum-classical interface. Similarly to classical GANs, QuGANs are trained using a loss function in the form of max likelihood, Wasserstein distance, or total variation. The gradients of the loss function can be calculated by applying the parameter-shift method or a linear combination of unitaries in order to update the parameters of the networks. In this paper, we review recent advances in quantum GANs. We discuss the structures, optimization, and network evaluation strategies of QuGANs. Different variants of quantum GANs are presented in detail.

AB Information-processing tasks modelled by homomorphisms between relational structures can witness quantum advantage when entanglement is used as a computational resource. We prove that the occurrence of quantum advantage is determined by the same type of algebraic structure (known as a minion) that captures the polymorphism identities of CSPs and, thus, CSP complexity. We investigate the connection between the minion of quantum advantage and other known minions controlling CSP tractability and width. In this way, we make use of complexity results from the algebraic theory of CSPs to characterise the occurrence of quantum advantage in the case of graphs, and to obtain new necessary and sufficient conditions in the case of arbitrary relational structures.

TI Effects of laser-annealing on fixed-frequency superconducting qubits
SO APPLIED PHYSICS LETTERS
AB As superconducting quantum processors increase in complexity, techniques to overcome constraints on frequency crowding are needed. The recently developed method of laser-annealing provides an effective post-fabrication method to adjust the frequency of superconducting qubits. Here, we present an automated laser-annealing apparatus based on conventional microscopy components and demonstrate preservation of highly coherent transmons. In addition, we perform noise spectroscopy to investigate the change in defect features, in particular, two-level system defects, after laser-annealing. Finally, we present a local heating model as well as demonstrate aging stability for laser-annealing on the wafer scale. Our work constitutes an important step toward both understanding the underlying physical mechanism and scaling up laser-annealing of superconducting qubits.

TI Verification of graph states in an untrusted network
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Graph states are a large class of multipartite entangled quantum states that form the basis of schemes for quantum computation, communication, error correction, metrology, and more. In this work, we consider verification of graph states generated by an untrusted source and shared between a network of possibly dishonest parties. This has implications in certifying the application of graph states for various distributed tasks. We present a protocol which is globally efficient for a large family of useful graph states, including cluster states, GHZ states, cycle graph states, and more. For general graph states, efficiency with respect to the security parameter is maintained, though there is a cost increase with the size of the graph state. The protocols are practical, requiring only multiple copies of the graph state, local measurements, and classical communication.

TI Fermion-Parity-Based Computation and Its Majorana-Zero-Mode
   Implementation
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB Majorana zero modes (MZMs) promise a platform for topologically protected fermionic quantum computation. However, creating multiple MZMs and generating (directly or via measurements) the requisite transformations (e.g., braids) pose significant challenges. We introduce fermion-parity-based computation (FPBC): a measurement-based scheme, modeled on Pauli-based computation, that uses efficient classical processing to virtually increase the number of available MZMs and which, given magic state inputs, operates without transformations. FPBC requires all MZM parities to be measurable, but this conflicts with constraints in proposed MZM hardware. We thus introduce a design in which all parities are directly measurable and which is hence well suited for FPBC. While developing FPBC, we identify the ???logical braid group??? as the fermionic analog of the Clifford group.

TI Traversable wormhole dynamics on a quantum processor
SO NATURE
AB The holographic principle, theorized to be a property of quantum gravity, postulates that the description of a volume of space can be encoded on a lower-dimensional boundary. The anti-de Sitter (AdS)/conformal field theory correspondence or duality(1) is the principal example of holography. The Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model of N >> 1 Majorana fermions(2,3) has features suggesting the existence of a gravitational dual in AdS(2), and is a new realization of holography(4-6). We invoke the holographic correspondence of the SYK many-body system and gravity to probe the conjectured ER=EPR relation between entanglement and spacetime geometry(7,8) through the traversable wormhole mechanism as implemented in the SYK model(9,10). A qubit can be used to probe the SYK traversable wormhole dynamics through the corresponding teleportation protocol(9). This can be realized as a quantum circuit, equivalent to the gravitational picture in the semiclassical limit of an infinite number of qubits(9). Here we use learning techniques to construct a sparsified SYK model that we experimentally realize with 164 two-qubit gates on a nine-qubit circuit and observe the corresponding traversable wormhole dynamics. Despite its approximate nature, the sparsified SYK model preserves key properties of the traversable wormhole physics: perfect size winding(11-13), coupling on either side of the wormhole that is consistent with a negative energy shockwave(14), a Shapiro time delay(15), causal time-order of signals emerging from the wormhole, and scrambling and thermalization dynamics(16,17). Our experiment was run on the Google Sycamore processor. By interrogating a two-dimensional gravity dual system, our work represents a step towards a program for studying quantum gravity in the laboratory. Future developments will require improved hardware scalability and performance as well as theoretical developments including higher-dimensional quantum gravity duals(18) and other SYK-like models(19).

TI Controlling Majorana hybridization in magnetic chain-superconductor
   systems
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB We propose controlling the hybridization between Majorana zero modes at the ends of magnetic adatom chains on superconductors by an additional magnetic adatom deposited close by. By tuning the additional adatom's magnetization, position, and coupling to the superconductor, we can couple and decouple the Majorana modes, as well as control the ground-state parity. The scheme is independent of microscopic details in ferromagnetic and helical magnetic chains on superconductors, with and without spin-orbit coupling, which we show by studying their full microscopic models and their common low-energy description. Our results show that scanning tunneling microscopy and electron-spin-resonance techniques are promising tools for controlling the Majorana hybridization in magnetic adatoms-superconductor setups, providing a basis for Majorana parity measurements, fusion, and braiding techniques.

TI Readout rebalancing for near-term quantum computers
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Readout errors are a significant source of noise for near-term intermediate-scale quantum computers. Mismeasuring a qubit as vertical bar 1 > when it should be vertical bar 0 > occurs much less often than mismeasuring a qubit as vertical bar 0 > when it should have been vertical bar 1 >. We make the simple observation that one can improve the readout fidelity of quantum computers by applying targeted X gates prior to performing a measurement. These X gates are placed so that the expected number of qubits in the vertical bar 1 > state is minimized Classical postprocessing can undo the effect of the X gates so that the expectation value of any observable is unchanged. This protocol is designed to have no effect when readout errors are symmetric. We show that the statistical uncertainty following readout error corrections is smaller when using readout rebalancing. The statistical advantage is circuit and computer dependent and is demonstrated for the W state, a Grover search, and for a Gaussian state. The benefit in statistical precision is most pronounced (and nearly a factor of 2 in some cases) when states with many qubits in the excited state have high probability.

Here, we demonstrate circular Bragg antennas that exhibit multiple spatially overlapping, polarization-selective optical resonances. Using templated atomic layer deposition of TiO2, these devices can be fabricated on arbitrary substrates, making them compatible with a wide range of nonlinear materials and sensing targets, and couple efficiently to underlying films.

TI Feedback cooling a levitated nanoparticle's libration to below 100
   phonons
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Macroscopic rotors are interesting model systems to test quantum theory and for quantum sensing. A promising approach for bringing these systems to the quantum regime is to combine sensitive detection with feedback cooling to reduce the thermal occupation of the mechanics. Here, we implement a backward-scattering scheme to efficiently detect all three libration modes of an optically levitated nanoparticle. We demonstrate parametric feedback cooling of all three libration degrees of freedom to below 16 mK, with one of the modes reaching the temperature of 1.3 mK, corresponding to a mean phonon number of 84. Finally, we characterize the backward-scattering scheme by determining its measurement efficiency to be 0.5%.

   nitrogen-vacancy centers in diamond
SO NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB In this paper we study the dynamics of an ensemble of nitrogen-vacancy centers in diamond when its photoluminescence is detected by means of a widefield imaging system. We develop a seven-level model and use it to simulate the widefield detection of nitrogen-vacancy centers Rabi oscillations. The simulation results are compared with experimental measurements showing a good agreement. In particular, we use the model to explain the asymmetric shape of the detected Rabi oscillations due to an incomplete repolarization of the nitrogen-vacancy center during the pulse sequence implemented for the detection of Rabi oscillations.

TI Highly-efficient third-harmonic generation from ultrapure diamond
   crystals
SO OPTICAL MATERIALS EXPRESS
AB We report on a direct generation of efficient and wavelength-tunable third-harmonic generation (THG) from ultrapure electronic-grade (EG) diamond crystals. Under an ultrafast infrared excitation at 1280 nm, the considerably high optical conversion efficiency of similar to 0.7% at a THG wavelength of 427 nm is obtained, and the THG signal can be tuned over ultra-broadband range from 420 to 730 nm. We argue that the THG efficiency is originating from minimum absorption loss and phase-matching conditions in EG diamond. Enhanced THG from EG diamond crystal represents a new paradigm for establishing efficient diamond-based frequency converters, quantum sensing, and quantum communications platforms.

TI Operator dynamics in Floquet many-body systems
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
AB We study operator dynamics in many-body quantum systems, focusing on generic features of systems that are ergodic, spatially extended, and lack conserved densities. Quantum circuits of various types provide simple models for such systems. We focus on Floquet quantum circuits, comparing their behavior with what has been found previously for circuits that are random in time. Floquet circuits, which have discrete time-translation symmetry, represent an intermediate case between circuits that are random in time and lack any symmetry, and systems with a time-independent Hamiltonian and continuous time-translation invariance. By making this comparison, one of our aims is to identify signatures of time-translation symmetry in Floquet operator dynamics. To characterize behavior we examine a variety of quantities in solvable models and numerically: operator autocorrelation functions; the partial spectral form factor; the out-of-time-order correlator (OTOC); and the paths in operator space that make the dominant contributions to the ensemble-averaged autocorrelation functions. Our most striking result is that ensemble-averaged autocorrelation functions show behavior that is distinctively different in Floquet systems compared to systems in which successive time-steps are independent. Specifically, while average autocorrelation functions decay on a microscopic timescale for circuits that are random in time, in Floquet systems they have a late-time tail with a duration that grows parametrically with the size of the operator support. In the simplest models this tail is separated from the initial decay by a minimum, so that the average autocorrelation function has an intermediate-time peak. The existence of these tails provides a way to understand deviations of the spectral form factor from random matrix behavior at times shorter than the Thouless time. In contrast to this feature in autocorrelation functions, we find no new aspects to the behavior of OTOCs for Floquet models compared to random-in-time circuits. We show that this difference between averaged autocorrelation functions and OTOCs can be understood in terms of the paths in operator space that contribute to the two quantities: paths for the former retain a limited support at late times, while paths for the latter are dominated by operator spreading.

TI Local discrimination of generalized Bell states via commutativity
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB We study the distinguishability of generalized Bell states under local operations and classical communication. We introduce the concept of a maximally commutative set (MCS), a subset of generalized Pauli matrices whose elements are mutually commutative, and there is no other generalized Pauli matrix that commutes with all the elements of this set. We find that MCS can be considered a detector for the local distinguishability of a set S of generalized Bell states. In fact, we get an efficient criterion. That is, if the difference set Delta S of S is disjoint with or completely contained in some MCS, then the set S is locally distinguishable. Furthermore, we give a useful characterization of MCS for arbitrary dimensions, which provides great convenience for detecting the local discrimination of generalized Bell states. Our method can be generalized to more general settings which contain the lattice qudit basis. The results of Fan [Phys. Rev. Lett. 92, 177905 (2004)], Tian et al. [Phys. Rev. A 92, 042320 (2015)], and a recent work Yuan et al. [arXiv:2109.07390] can be deduced as special cases of our result.

TI Microscale sensing with strongly interacting NV ensembles at high fields
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Advances in sensing devices that utilize nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center ensembles in diamond are driving progress in microscale nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Utilizing quantum sensing techniques in the high-field regime significantly boosts sensitivity by increasing thermal polarization and improves spectral quality via enhanced energy shifts. Compatible with the latter, a straightforward manner to further raise sensor sensitivity is to increase NV concentration, although this intensifies detrimental dipole-dipole interactions among NVs. In this Letter, we present a method for detecting NMR signals in high-field scenarios while effectively suppressing dipole-dipole couplings in the NV ensemble. Thus, this approach enhances sensitivity by combining highly doped diamond substrates and elevated magnetic fields.

TI Correlative Nanoscale Imaging of Strained hBN Spin Defects
SO ACS APPLIED MATERIALS & INTERFACES
AB Spin defects like the negatively charged boron vacancy color center (VB- ) in hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) may enable new forms of quantum sensing with near-surface defects in layered van der Waals heterostructures. Here, the effect of strain on VB- color centers in hBN is revealed with correlative cathodoluminescence and photoluminescence microscopies. Strong localized enhancement and redshifting of the VB- luminescence is observed at creases, consistent with density functional theory calculations showing VB- migration toward regions with moderate uniaxial compressive strain. The ability to manipulate spin defects with highly localized strain is critical to the development of practical 2D quantum devices and quantum sensors.

SO SCIPOST PHYSICS
AB Quantum Chemistry and Physics have been pinpointed as killer applications for quantum computers, and quantum algorithms have been designed to solve the Schrodinger equation with the wavefunction formalism. It is yet limited to small systems, as their size is dictated by the number of qubits available. Computations on large systems rely mainly on mean-field-type approaches such as density functional theory, for which no quantum advantage has been envisioned so far. In this work, we question this a priori by proposing a counter-intuitive mapping from the non-interacting to an auxiliary interacting Hamiltonian that may provide the desired advantage.

TI Experimental two-dimensional Raman cooling with orthogonal geometry

AB Despite the remarkable achievements in precision measurement, the transverse diffusion of atom ensembles remains the main factor that hinders further improvements in the accuracy of matter-wave interferometry. This paper demonstrates a two-dimensional deep cooling method based on the orthogonal Raman geometry. After 35 milliseconds of cooling, the atom ensemble reaches a temperature lower than 100 nanokelvins in the horizontal plane, and a cooling efficiency of 30% approximately. In the meantime, the cooled atoms exhibit high uniformity in all directions. These characteristics render this cooling protocol more suitable for quantum sensing compared with ultracold atoms or optical molasses.

AB I propose a quantum metrology protocol for measuring frequencies and weak forces based on a periodic modulating quantum Jahn-Teller system composed of a single spin and two bosonic modes. I show that, in the first order of the frequency drive, the time-independent effective Hamiltonian describes spin-dependent interaction between the two bosonic modes. In the limit of high-frequency drive and low bosonic frequency, the quantum Jahn-Teller system exhibits critical behavior which can be used for high-precision quantum estimation. A major advantage of the scheme is the robustness of the system against spin decoherence, which allows it to perform parameter estimation with measurement time not limited by spin dephasing.

TI Reservoir Engineering Strong Magnomechanical Entanglement via Dual-Mode
   Cooling
SO ANNALEN DER PHYSIK
AB A hybrid cavity magnomechanical system to transfer the bipartite entanglements and achieve the strong microwave photon-phonon entanglement based on the reservoir engineering approach is constructed. The magnon mode is coupled to the microwave cavity mode via magnetic dipole interaction and to the phonon mode via magnetostrictive force (optomechanical-like). It is shown that the initial magnon-phonon entanglement can be transferred to the photon-phonon subspace in the case of these two interactions cooperating. In the reservoir-engineering parameter regime, the initial entanglement is directionally transferred to the photon-phonon subsystem, so a strong bipartite entanglement in which the magnon mode acts as the cold reservoir to effectively cool the Bogoliubov mode delocalized over the cavity and the mechanical deformation mode is obtained. Moreover, dual-mode cooling is realized by engineering the dissipation of photon and phonon modes within the target mode, which allows entanglement to be further enhanced. The results indicate that the steady-state entanglement is robust against temperature. The dual-mode cooling reservoir engineering scheme can potentially be extended to other three-mode quantum systems.

TI Arbitrarily polarized bound states in the continuum with twisted
   photonic crystal slabs
SO LIGHT-SCIENCE & APPLICATIONS
AB Arbitrary polarized vortex beam induced by polarization singularity offers a new platform for both classical optics and quantum entanglement applications. Bound states in the continuum (BICs) have been demonstrated to be associated with topological charge and vortex polarization singularities in momentum space. For conventional symmetric photonic crystal slabs (PhCSs), BIC is enclosed by linearly polarized far fields with winding angle of 2 pi, which is unfavorable for high-capacity and multi-functionality integration-optics applications. Here, we show that by breaking sigma(z)-symmetry of the PhCS, asymmetry in upward and downward directions and arbitrarily polarized BIC can be realized with a bilayer-twisted PhCS. It exhibits elliptical polarization states with constant ellipticity angle at every point in momentum space within the vicinity of BIC. The topological nature of BIC reflects on the orientation angle of polarization state, with a topological charge of 1 for any value of ellipticity angle. Full coverage of Poincare sphere (i.e., -(pi)/(4) <= chi <= (pi)/(4) and -(pi)/(2) <= psi <= (pi)/(2)) and higher-order Poincare sphere can be realized by tailoring the twist angles. Our findings may open up new avenues for applications in structured light, quantum optics, and twistronics for photons.

TI Experimental Counterexample to Bell's Locality Criterion
SO ENTROPY
AB The EPR paradox was caused by the provision that quantum variables must have pre-existing values. This type of "hidden property realism" was later falsified by Bell's Theorem. Accordingly, the physical basis for action-at-a-distance between entangled quanta was removed. Yet, modern interpretations present Bell's inequality as a Locality Criterion, as if Bell violations can only happen at the quantum level, and only with remote interactions. This is a questionable practice, considering that classical joint measurements also violate such inequalities for mutually exclusive wave properties. In particular, consecutive measurements of polarization produce the same coefficients of correlation as parallel measurements with entangled quanta, yet they are explicitly local. Furthermore, it is possible to combine parallel and consecutive measurements of Type I polarization-entangled photons in a single experiment, conclusively showing that quantum Bell violations can be local. Surprisingly, classical phenomena also require nonlocal interpretations if pre-existing properties are taken for granted. Hence, the solution is to reject the models with pre-existing properties for both classical and quantum wave-like phenomena.

TI Active quasi-BIC optical vortex generators for ultrafast switching
SO NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB The Pancharatnam-Berry phase induced by the winding topology of polarization around a vortex singularity at bound states in the continuum (BIC) provides a unique approach to optical vortex (OV) generation. The BIC-based OV generators have the potential to outperform their counterparts that rely on spatial variations in terms of design feasibility, fabrication complexity, and robustness. However, given the fact that this class of OV generators originates from the topological property of the photonic bands, their responses are generally fixed and cannot be dynamically altered, which limits their applications to photonic systems. Here, we numerically demonstrate that a silicon photonic crystal slab can be used to realize optically switchable OV generation by simultaneously exploiting the vortex topology in momentum space in conjunction with silicon's nonlinear dynamics. Picosecond switching of OV beams at near-infrared wavelengths are observed. The demonstrated nontrivial topological nature of the active generators can significantly expand the application of BIC toward ultrafast vortex beam generation, high-capacity optical communication, and mode-division multiplexing.

TI Highly efficient phase-tunable photonic thermal diode
SO APPLIED PHYSICS LETTERS
AB We investigate the photon-mediated thermal transport between a superconducting electrode and a normal metal. When the quasiparticle contribution can be neglected, the photon-mediated channel becomes an efficient heat transport relaxation process for the superconductor at low temperatures, being larger than the intrinsic contribution due to the electron-phonon interaction. Furthermore, the superconductor-normal metal system acts as a nearly perfect thermal diode, with a rectification factor up to 10(8) for a realistic aluminum superconductor. The rectification factor can also be tuned in a phase-controlled fashion through a non-galvanic coupling, realized by changing the magnetic flux piercing a superconducting quantum interference device, which modifies the coupling impedance between the superconductor and the normal metal. The scheme can be exploited for passive cooling in superconducting quantum circuits by transferring heat toward normal metallic pads where it dissipates more efficiently or for more general thermal management purposes.

TI Optimal low-depth quantum signal-processing phase estimation
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Quantum effects like entanglement and coherent amplification can be used to drastically enhance the accuracy of quantum parameter estimation beyond classical limits. However, challenges such as decoherence and time-dependent errors hinder Heisenberg-limited amplification. We introduce Quantum Signal-Processing Phase Estimation algorithms that are robust against these challenges and achieve optimal performance as dictated by the Cram & eacute;r-Rao bound. These algorithms use quantum signal transformation to decouple interdependent phase parameters into largely orthogonal ones, ensuring that time-dependent errors in one do not compromise the accuracy of learning the other. Combining provably optimal classical estimation with near-optimal quantum circuit design, our approach achieves a standard deviation accuracy of 10(-4) radians for estimating unwanted swap angles in superconducting two-qubit experiments, using low-depth ( < 10) circuits. This represents up to two orders of magnitude improvement over existing methods. Theoretically and numerically, we demonstrate the optimality of our algorithm against time-dependent phase errors, observing that the variance of the time-sensitive parameter phi scales faster than the asymptotic Heisenberg scaling in the small-depth regime. Our results are rigorously validated against the quantum Fisher information, confirming our protocol's ability to achieve unmatched precision for two-qubit gate learning.

TI Reservoir-engineering shortcuts to adiabaticity
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB We propose a protocol that achieves fast adiabatic transfer between two orthogonal states of a qubit by coupling with an ancilla. The qubit undergoes Landau-Zener dynamics, whereas the coupling realizes a time-dependent Hamiltonian, which is diagonal in the spin's instantaneous Landau-Zener eigenstates. The ancilla (or meter), in turn, couples to a thermal bath such that the overall dynamics is incoherent. We analyze the protocol's fidelity as a function of the strength of the coupling and of the relaxation rate of the meter. When the meter's decay rate is the largest frequency scale of the dynamics, the spin dynamics is encompassed by a master equation describing dephasing of the spin in the instantaneous eigenbasis. In this regime, the fidelity of adiabatic transfer improves as the bath temperature is increased. Surprisingly, the adiabatic transfer is significantly more efficient in the opposite regime, where the timescale of the ancilla dynamics is comparable to the characteristic spin timescale. Here, for low temperatures the coupling with the ancilla tends to suppress diabatic transitions via effective cooling. The protocol can be efficiently implemented by means of a pulsed, stroboscopic coupling with the ancilla and is robust against moderate fluctuations of the experimental parameters.

TI Detecting Hidden Photon Dark Matter Using the Direct Excitation of
   Transmon Qubits
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB We propose a novel dark matter detection method utilizing the excitation of superconducting transmon qubits. Assuming the hidden photon dark matter of a mass of O(10) mu eV, the classical wave-matter oscillation induces an effective ac electric field via the small kinetic mixing with the ordinary photon. This serves as a coherent drive field for a qubit when it is resonant, evolving it from the ground state towards the first-excited state. We evaluate the rate of such evolution and observable excitations in the measurements, as well as the search sensitivity to the hidden photon dark matter. For a selected mass, one can reach epsilon similar to 10-13-10-12 (where epsilon is the kinetic mixing parameter of the hidden photon) with a few tens of seconds using a single standard transmon qubit. A simple extension to the frequency-tunable SQUID-based transmon enables the mass scan to cover the range of 4-40 mu eV (1-10 GHz) within a reasonable length of run time. The scheme has great potential to extend the sensitivity towards various directions including being incorporated into the cavity-based haloscope experiments or the currently available multibit noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) computer machines.

TI Diagrammatic approach to scattering of multiphoton states in waveguide
   QED
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB We give an exposure to diagrammatic techniques in waveguide quantum electrodynamics (QED) systems. A particular emphasis is placed on the systems with delayed coherent quantum feedback. Specifically, we show that the N-photon scattering matrices in single-qubit waveguide QED systems, within the rotating wave approximation, admit for a parametrization in terms of (N - 1)-photon effective vertex functions and provide a detailed derivation of a closed hierarchy of generalized Bethe-Salpeter equations satisfied by these vertex functions. The advantage of this method is that the above-mentioned integral equations hold independently of the number of radiation channels, their bandwidth, the dispersion of the modes they are supporting, and the structure of the radiation-qubit coupling interaction, thus enabling one to study multiphoton scattering problems beyond the Born-Markov approximation. Further, we generalize the diagrammatic techniques to the systems containing more than a single emitter by presenting an exact set of equations governing the generic two- and three-photon scattering operators. The above-described theoretical machinery is then showcased on the example of a three-photon scattering on a giant acoustic atom, recently studied experimentally.

TI Absence of Fast Scrambling in Thermodynamically Stable Long-Range
   Interacting Systems
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB In this study, we investigate out-of-time-order correlators (OTOCs) in systems with power-law decaying interactions such as R-alpha, where R is the distance. In such systems, the fast scrambling of quantum information or the exponential growth of information propagation can potentially occur according to the decay rate a. In this regard, a crucial open challenge is to identify the optimal condition for a such that fast scrambling cannot occur. In this study, we disprove fast scrambling in generic long-range interacting systems with alpha > D (D: spatial dimension), where the total energy is extensive in terms of system size and the thermodynamic limit is well defined. We rigorously demonstrate that the OTOC shows a polynomial growth over time as long as alpha > D and the necessary scrambling time over a distance R is larger than t greater than or similar to R[(2 alpha-2D)/(2 alpha-D+1)].

TI Stabilized quantum-enhanced SIEM architecture and speed-up through
   Hoeffding tree algorithms enable quantum cybersecurity analytics in
   botnet detection
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB For the first time, we enable the execution of hybrid quantum machine learning (HQML) methods on real quantum computers with 100 data samples and real-device-based simulations with 5000 data samples, thereby outperforming the current state of research of Suryotrisongko and Musashi from 2022 who were dealing with 1000 data samples and quantum simulators (pure software-based emulators) only. Additionally, we beat their reported accuracy of 76.8% by an average accuracy of 91.2%, all within a total execution time of 1687 s. We achieve this significant progress through two-step strategy: Firstly, we establish a stable quantum architecture that enables us to execute HQML algorithms on real quantum devices. Secondly, we introduce new hybrid quantum binary classifiers (HQBCs) based on Hoeffding decision tree algorithms. These algorithms speed up the process via batch-wise execution, reducing the number of shots required on real quantum devices compared to conventional loop-based optimizers. Their incremental nature serves the purpose of online large-scale data streaming for domain generation algorithm (DGA) botnet detection, and allows us to apply HQML to the field of cybersecurity analytics. We conduct our experiments using the Qiskit library with the Aer quantum simulator, and on three different real quantum devices from Azure Quantum: IonQ, Rigetti, and Quantinuum. This is the first time these tools are combined in this manner.

TI Quantumness Measures for a System of Two Qubits Interacting with a Field
   in the Presence of the Time-Dependent Interaction and Kerr Medium
SO ENTROPY
AB In this work, we introduce the standard Tavis-Cummings model to describe two-qubit system interacting with a single-mode field associated to power-law (PL) potentials. We explore the effect of the time-dependent interaction and the Kerr-like medium. We solve the Schrodinger equation to obtain the density operator that allows us to investigate the dynamical behaviour of some quantumness measures, such as von Neumann entropy, negativity and Mandel's parameter. We provide how these entanglement measures depend on the system parameters, which paves the way towards better control of entanglement generation in two-qubit systems. We find that the enhancement and preservation of the atoms-field entanglement and atom-atom entanglement can be achieved by a proper choice of the initial parameters of the field in the absence and presence of the time-dependent interaction and Kerr medium. We examine the photons distribution of the field and determine the situations for which the field exhibits super-poissonian, poissonian or sub-poissonian distribution.

TI Optimization of the variational quantum eigensolver for quantum
   chemistry applications
SO AVS QUANTUM SCIENCE
AB This work studies the variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) algorithm, which is designed to determine the ground state of a quantum mechanical system by combining classical and quantum hardware. Two methods of reducing the number of required qubit manipulations, prone to induce errors, for the variational quantum eigensolver are studied. First, we formally justify the multiple Z(2) symmetry qubit reduction scheme first sketched by Bravyi et al. [arXiv:1701.08213 (2017)]. Second, we show that even in small, but non-trivial systems such as H-2, LiH, and H2O, the choice of entangling methods (gate based or native) gives rise to varying rates of convergence to the ground state of the system. Through both the removal of qubits and the choice of entangler, the demands on the quantum hardware can be reduced. We find that in general, analyzing the VQE problem is complex, where the number of qubits, the method of entangling, and the depth of the search space all interact. In specific cases however, concrete results can be shown, and an entangling method can be recommended over others as it outperforms in terms of difference from the ground state energy.

TI Artificial Intelligence-Driven Strategies for Targeted Delivery and
   Enhanced Stability of RNA-Based Lipid Nanoparticle Cancer Vaccines
SO PHARMACEUTICS
AB The convergence of artificial intelligence (AI) and nanomedicine has transformed cancer vaccine development, particularly in optimizing RNA-loaded lipid nanoparticles (LNPs). Stability and targeted delivery are major obstacles to the clinical translation of promising RNA-LNP vaccines for cancer immunotherapy. This systematic review analyzes the AI's impact on LNP engineering through machine learning-driven predictive models, generative adversarial networks (GANs) for novel lipid design, and neural network-enhanced biodistribution prediction. AI reduces the therapeutic development timeline through accelerated virtual screening of millions of lipid combinations, compared to conventional high-throughput screening. Furthermore, AI-optimized LNPs demonstrate improved tumor targeting. GAN-generated lipids show structural novelty while maintaining higher encapsulation efficiency; graph neural networks predict RNA-LNP binding affinity with high accuracy vs. experimental data; digital twins reduce lyophilization optimization from years to months; and federated learning models enable multi-institutional data sharing. We propose a framework to address key technical challenges: training data quality (min. 15,000 lipid structures), model interpretability (SHAP > 0.65), and regulatory compliance (21CFR Part 11). AI integration reduces manufacturing costs and makes personalized cancer vaccine affordable. Future directions need to prioritize quantum machine learning for stability prediction and edge computing for real-time formulation modifications.

TI Conditions tighter than noncommutation needed for nonclassicality
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICS A-MATHEMATICAL AND THEORETICAL
AB Kirkwood discovered in 1933, and Dirac discovered in 1945, a representation of quantum states that has undergone a renaissance recently. The Kirkwood-Dirac (KD) distribution has been employed to study nonclassicality across quantum physics, from metrology to chaos to the foundations of quantum theory. The KD distribution is a quasiprobability distribution, a quantum generalization of a probability distribution, which can behave nonclassically by having negative or nonreal elements. Negative KD elements signify quantum information scrambling and potential metrological quantum advantages. Nonreal elements encode measurement disturbance and thermodynamic nonclassicality. KD distributions' nonclassicality has been believed to follow necessarily from pairwise noncommutation of operators in the distribution's definition. We show that noncommutation does not suffice. We prove sufficient conditions for the KD distribution to be nonclassical (equivalently, necessary conditions for it to be classical). We also quantify the KD nonclassicality achievable under various conditions. This work resolves long-standing questions about nonclassicality and may be used to engineer quantum advantages.

TI Hybrid quantum-classical convolutional neural network for phytoplankton
   classification
SO FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE
AB The taxonomic composition and abundance of phytoplankton have a direct impact on marine ecosystem dynamics and global environment change. Phytoplankton classification is crucial for phytoplankton analysis, but it is challenging due to their large quantity and small size. Machine learning is the primary method for automatically performing phytoplankton image classification. As large-scale research on marine phytoplankton generates overwhelming amounts of data, more powerful computational resources are required for the success of machine learning methods. Recently, quantum machine learning has emerged as a potential solution for large-scale data processing by harnessing the exponentially computational power of quantum computers. Here, for the first time, we demonstrate the feasibility of using quantum deep neural networks for phytoplankton classification. Hybrid quantum-classical convolutional and residual neural networks are developed based on the classical architectures. These models strike a balance between the limited function of current quantum devices and the large size of phytoplankton images, making it possible to perform phytoplankton classification on near-term quantum computers. Our quantum models demonstrate superior performance compared to their classical counterparts, exhibiting faster convergence, higher classification accuracy and lower accuracy fluctuation. The present quantum models are versatile and can be applied to various tasks of image classification in the field of marine science.

TI Improved Single-Shot Decoding of Higher-Dimensional Hypergraph-Product
   Codes
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB In this work, we study the single-shot performance of higher-dimensional hypergraph product codes decoded using belief propagation and ordered-statistics decoding [P. Panteleev and G. Kalachev, Quantum 5, 585 (2021)]. We find that decoding data-qubit and syndrome-measurement errors together in a single stage leads to single-shot thresholds that greatly exceed all previously observed single-shot thresholds for these codes. For the three-dimensional toric code and a phenomenological noise model, our results are consistent with a sustainable threshold of 7.1% for Z errors, compared to the threshold of 2.90% previously found using a two-stage decoder [Quintavalle et al., 2021]. For the four-dimensional (4D) toric code, for which both X and Z error correction is single shot, our results are consistent with a sustainable single-shot threshold of 4.3%, which is even higher than the threshold of 2.93% for the two-dimensional toric code for the same noise model but using L rounds of stabilizer measurement. We also explore the performance of balanced-product and 4D hypergraph-product codes, which we show lead to a reduction in qubit overhead compared the surface code for phenomenological error rates as high as 1%.

TI Operator spreading in the memory matrix formalism
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICS A-MATHEMATICAL AND THEORETICAL
AB The spread and scrambling of quantum information is a topic of considerable current interest. Numerous studies suggest that quantum information evolves according to hydrodynamical equations of motion, even though it is a starkly different quantity to better-known hydrodynamical variables such as charge and energy. In this work we show that the well-known memory matrix formalism for traditional hydrodynamics can be applied, with relatively little modification, to the question of operator growth in many-body quantum systems. On a conceptual level, this shores up the connection between information scrambling and hydrodynamics. At a practical level, it provides a framework for calculating quantities related to operator growth like the butterfly velocity and front diffusion constant, and for understanding how these quantities are constrained by microscopic symmetries. We apply this formalism to calculate operator-hydrodynamical coefficients perturbatively in a family of Floquet models. Our formalism allows us to identify the processes affecting information transport that arise from the spatiotemporal symmetries of the model.

TI A non-commutative Bayes' theorem
SO LINEAR ALGEBRA AND ITS APPLICATIONS
AB Using a diagrammatic reformulation of Bayes' theorem, we provide a necessary and sufficient condition for the existence of Bayesian inference in the setting of finite-dimensional C*- algebras. In other words, we prove an analogue of Bayes' theorem in the joint classical and quantum context. Our analogue is justified by recent advances in categorical probability theory, which have provided an abstract formulation of the classical Bayes' theorem. In the process, we further develop non-commutative almost everywhere equivalence and illustrate its important role in non-commutative Bayesian inversion. The construction of such Bayesian inverses, when they exist, involves solving a positive semidefinite matrix completion problem for the Choi matrix. This gives a solution to the open problem of constructing Bayesian inversion for completely positive unital maps acting on density matrices that do not have full support. We illustrate how the procedure works for several examples relevant to quantum information theory. (C) 2022 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI Trapping Ba+ with seven-fold enhanced efficiency utilizing an
   autoionizing resonance
SO QUANTUM SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB Trapped ions have emerged as a front runner in quantum information processing due to their identical nature, all-to-all connectivity, and high fidelity quantum operations. As current trapped ion technologies are scaled, it will be important to improve the efficiency of loading ions, especially when working with long chains of ions or rare isotopes. Here, we compare two different isotope-selective photoionization schemes for loading Ba-138(+) ions. We show that a two-step photoionization scheme ending in an autoionizing transition increases the ion loading rate nearly an order of magnitude compared to an established technique which does not excite an autoionizing state. Our novel photoionization scheme can be extended to all isotopes of barium. Given that autoionizing resonances exist in every trapped ion species, exploitation of this process is a promising pathway to increase the loading rates for trapped ion computers.

TI Light-matter quantum interface with continuous pump and probe
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICS B-ATOMIC MOLECULAR AND OPTICAL PHYSICS
AB Spin-polarized atomic ensembles probed by light based on the Faraday interaction are a versatile platform for numerous applications in quantum metrology and quantum information processing. Here we consider an ensemble of Alkali atoms that are continuously optically pumped and probed. Due to the collective scattering of photons at large optical depth, the steady state of atoms does not correspond to an uncorrelated tensor-product state, as is usually assumed. We introduce a self-consistent method to approximate the steady state including the pair correlations, taking into account the multilevel structure of atoms. We find and characterize regimes of Raman lasing, akin to the model of a superradiant laser. We determine the spectrum of the collectively scattered photons, which also characterizes the coherence time of the collective spin excitations on top of the stationary correlated mean-field state, as relevant for applications in metrology and quantum information.

TI Multi-Way Noiseless Signal Amplification in a Symmetrical Cascaded
   Four-Wave Mixing Process
SO PHOTONICS
AB According to the fundamental laws of quantum optics, vacuum noise is inevitably added to the signal when one tries to amplify a signal. However, it has been recently shown that noiseless signal amplification can be realized when a phase-sensitive process is involved. Two phase-sensitive schemes, a correlation injection scheme and a two-beam phase-sensitive amplifier scheme, are both proposed to realize multi-way noiseless signal amplification in a symmetrical cascaded four-wave mixing process. We theoretically study the possibility of the realization of four-way noiseless signal amplification by using these two schemes. The results show that the correlation injection scheme can only realize one-way noiseless signal amplification, but that the two-beam phase-sensitive amplifier scheme can lead to four-way noise figure values below 1. Our results here may find potential applications in quantum information processing, e.g., the realization of quantum information tap and quantum non-demolition measurement, etc.

TI Dimensionality Reduction with Variational Encoders Based on Subsystem
   Purification
SO MATHEMATICS
AB Efficient methods for encoding and compression are likely to pave the way toward the problem of efficient trainability on higher-dimensional Hilbert spaces, overcoming issues of barren plateaus. Here, we propose an alternative approach to variational autoencoders to reduce the dimensionality of states represented in higher dimensional Hilbert spaces. To this end, we build a variational algorithm-based autoencoder circuit that takes as input a dataset and optimizes the parameters of a Parameterized Quantum Circuit (PQC) ansatz to produce an output state that can be represented as a tensor product of two subsystems by minimizing Tr(rho 2). The output of this circuit is passed through a series of controlled swap gates and measurements to output a state with half the number of qubits while retaining the features of the starting state in the same spirit as any dimension-reduction technique used in classical algorithms. The output obtained is used for supervised learning to guarantee the working of the encoding procedure thus developed. We make use of the Bars and Stripes (BAS) dataset for an 8 x 8 grid to create efficient encoding states and report a classification accuracy of 95% on the same. Thus, the demonstrated example provides proof for the working of the method in reducing states represented in large Hilbert spaces while maintaining the features required for any further machine learning algorithm that follows.

TI Grain-boundary topological superconductor
SO COMMUNICATIONS PHYSICS
AB Majorana zero modes (MZMs) are of central importance for modern condensed matter physics and quantum information due to their non-Abelian nature, which thereby offers the possibility of realizing topological quantum bits. We here show that a grain boundary (GB) defect can host a topological superconductor (SC), with a pair of cohabitating MZMs at its end when immersed in a parent two-dimensional gapped topological SC with the Fermi surface enclosing a nonzero momentum. The essence of our proposal lies in the magnetic-field driven hybridization of the localized MZMs at the elementary blocks of the GB defect, the single lattice dislocations, due to the MZM spin being locked to the Burgers vector. Indeed, as we show through numerical and analytical calculations, the GB topological SC with two localized MZMs emerges in a finite range of both the angle and magnitude of the external magnetic field. Our work demonstrates the possibility of defect-based platforms for quantum information technology and opens up a route for their systematic search in future.

TI Penalty methods for a variational quantum eigensolver
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB The variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) is a promising algorithm to compute eigenstates and eigenenergies of a given quantum system that can be performed on a near-term quantum computer. Obtaining eigenstates and eigenenergies in a specific symmetry sector of the system is often necessary for practical applications of the VQE in various fields ranging from high-energy physics to quantum chemistry. It is common to add a penalty term in the cost function of the VQE to calculate such a symmetry-resolving energy spectrum; however, systematic analysis of the effect of the penalty term has been lacking, and the use of the penalty term in the VQE has not been justified rigorously. In this paper, we investigate two major types of penalty terms for the VQE that were proposed in previous studies. We show that a penalty term of one of the two types works properly in that eigenstates obtained by the VQE with the penalty term reside in the desired symmetry sector. We further give a convenient formula to determine the magnitude of the penalty term, which may lead to faster convergence of the VQE. Meanwhile, we prove that the other type of penalty term does not work for obtaining the target state with the desired symmetry in a rigorous sense and even gives completely wrong results in some cases. We finally provide numerical simulations to validate our analysis. Our results apply to general quantum systems and lay the theoretical foundation for the use of the VQE with the penalty terms to obtain the symmetry-resolving energy spectrum of the system, which fuels the application of a near-term quantum computer.

TI Adaptive-Step Perturb-and-Observe Algorithm for Multidimensional Phase
   Noise Stabilization in Fiber-Based Multi-Arm Mach-Zehnder
   Interferometers
SO ALGORITHMS
AB Fiber-optic Mach-Zehnder interferometers are widely used in research areas such as telecommunications, spectroscopy, and quantum information. These optical structures are known to be affected by phase fluctuations that are usually modeled as multiparametric noise. This multidimensional noise must be stabilized or compensated for to enable fiber-optic Mach-Zehnder architectures for practical applications. In this work, we study the effectiveness of a modified Perturb-and-Observe (P&O) algorithm to control multidimensional phase noise in fiber-based multi-arm Mach-Zehnder interferometers. We demonstrate the feasibility of stabilizing multidimensional phase noise by numerical simulations using a simple feedback control scheme and analyze the algorithm's performance for systems up to dimension 8x8. We achieved minimal steady-state errors that guarantee high optical visibility in complex optical systems with NxN matrices (with N=[2,3,4,5,6,7,8]).

TI Toward DMC Accuracy Across Chemical Space with Scalable ?-QML
SO JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL THEORY AND COMPUTATION
AB In the past decade, quantum diffusion Monte Carlo (DMC) has been demonstrated to successfully predict the energetics and properties of a wide range of molecules and solids by numerically solving the electronic many-body Schro''dinger equation. With O(N3) scaling with the number of electrons N, DMC has the potential to be a reference method for larger systems that are not accessible to more traditional methods such as CCSD(T). Assessing the accuracy of DMC for smaller molecules becomes the stepping stone in making the method a reference for larger systems. We show that when coupled with quantum machine learning (QML)-based surrogate methods, the computational burden can be alleviated such that quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) shows clear potential to undergird the formation of high-quality descriptions across chemical space. We discuss three crucial approximations necessary to accomplish this: the fixed-node approximation, universal and accurate references for chemical bond dissociation energies, and scalable minimal amons-set-based QML (AQML) models. Numerical evidence presented includes converged DMC results for over 1000 small organic molecules with up to five heavy atoms used as amons and 50 medium-sized organic molecules with nine heavy atoms to validate the AQML predictions. Numerical evidence collected for Delta-AQML models suggests that already modestly sized QMC training data sets of amons suffice to predict total energies with near chemical accuracy throughout chemical space.

TI On reducing the amount of samples required for training of QNNs:
   constraints on the linear structure of the training data
SO QUANTUM MACHINE INTELLIGENCE
AB Training classical neural networks generally requires a large number of training samples. Using entangled training samples, Quantum Neural Networks (QNNs) have the potential to significantly reduce the amount of training samples required in the training process. However, to minimize the number of incorrect predictions made by the resulting QNN, it is essential that the structure of the training samples meets certain requirements. On the one hand, the exact degree of entanglement must be fixed for the whole set of training samples. On the other hand, training samples must be linearly independent and non-orthogonal. However, how failing to meet these requirements affects the resulting QNN is not fully studied. To address this, we extend the proof of the Quantum No-Free-Lunch theorem to (i) provide a generalization of the theorem for varying degrees of entanglement. This generalization shows that the average degree of entanglement in the set of training samples can be used to predict the expected quality of the QNN. Furthermore, we (ii) introduce new estimates for the expected accuracy of QNNs for moderately entangled training samples that are linearly dependent or orthogonal. Our analytical results are (iii) experimentally validated by simulating QNN training and analyzing the quality of the QNN after training.

TI Hybrid quantum physics-informed neural networks for simulating
   computational fluid dynamics in complex shapes
SO MACHINE LEARNING-SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB Finding the distribution of the velocities and pressures of a fluid by solving the Navier-Stokes equations is a principal task in the chemical, energy, and pharmaceutical industries, as well as in mechanical engineering and in design of pipeline systems. With existing solvers, such as OpenFOAM and Ansys, simulations of fluid dynamics in intricate geometries are computationally expensive and require re-simulation whenever the geometric parameters or the initial and boundary conditions are altered. Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) are a promising tool for simulating fluid flows in complex geometries, as they can adapt to changes in the geometry and mesh definitions, allowing for generalization across fluid parameters and transfer learning across different shapes. We present a hybrid quantum PINN (HQPINN) that simulates laminar fluid flow in 3D Y-shaped mixers. Our approach combines the expressive power of a quantum model with the flexibility of a PINN, resulting in a 21% higher accuracy compared to a purely classical neural network. Our findings highlight the potential of machine learning approaches, and in particular HQPINN, for complex shape optimization tasks in computational fluid dynamics. By improving the accuracy of fluid simulations in complex geometries, our research using hybrid quantum models contributes to the development of more efficient and reliable fluid dynamics solvers.

AB Generative modeling has seen a rising interest in both classical and quantum machine learning, and it represents a promising candidate to obtain a practical quantum advantage in the near term. In this study, we build over an existing framework for evaluating the generalization performance of generative models, and we establish the first quantitative comparative race towards practical quantum advantage (PQA) between classical and quantum generative models, namely Quantum Circuit Born Machines (QCBMs), Transformers (TFs), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), Variational Autoencoders (VAEs), and Wasserstein Generative Adversarial Networks (WGANs). After defining four types of PQAs scenarios, we focus on what we refer to as potential PQA, aiming to compare quantum models with the best-known classical algorithms for the task at hand. We let the models race on a well-defined and application-relevant competition setting, where we illustrate and demonstrate our framework on 20 variables (qubits) generative modeling task. Our results suggest that QCBMs are more efficient in the data-limited regime than the other state-of-the-art classical generative models. Such a feature is highly desirable in a wide range of real-world applications where the available data is scarce.
   Generative modeling has become a widespread method in many areas of science. This work provides a comprehensive comparison between quantum and classical generative modeling techniques, with promising prospects for quantum generative modeling towards reaching practical quantum advantage.

TI Quantum-enhanced algorithms for classical target detection in complex
   environments
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Quantum computational approaches to some classic target identification and localization algorithms, especially for radar images, are investigated, and are found to raise a number of quantum statistics and quantum measurement issues with much broader applicability. Such algorithms are computationally intensive, involving coherent processing of large sensor data sets in order to extract a small number of low profile targets from a cluttered background. Target enhancement is accomplished through accurate statistical characterization of the environment, followed by optimal identification of statistical outliers. The algorithm is inspired by recent approaches to quantum machine learning, but requires significant extensions, including previously overlooked "quantum analog-digital" conversion steps (which are found to substantially increase the required number of qubits), "quantum statistical" generalization of the classic phase estimation and Grover search algorithms, and careful consideration of projected measurement operations. The key result of the paper is that the environmental covariance matrix estimation and manipulation at the heart of the statistical analysis, together with the target identification step, actually enable a highly efficient quantum implementation. However, several potential bottlenecks, especially those associated with data loading and conversion, are exhibited as well. Although no fundamental barrier to quantum speed-up is identified, optimal algorithm implementation, accounting for additional numbers of qubits and possible new error correction protocols associated with the quantum analog representation, remains an interesting question for future research.

TI No Practical Quantum Broadcasting: Even Virtually
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB Quantum information cannot be broadcast-an intrinsic limitation imposed by quantum mechanics. However, recent advances in virtual operations offer new insights into the no-broadcasting theorem. Here, we focus on the practical utility and introduce sample efficiency as a fundamental constraint, requiring any practical broadcasting protocol perform no worse than the naive approach of direct preparation and distribution. We prove that no linear process-whether quantum or beyond-can simultaneously uphold sample efficiency, unitary covariance, permutation invariance, and classical consistency. This leads to a nopractical-broadcasting theorem, which places strict limits on the practical distribution of quantum information. By applying Schur-Weyl duality, we establish the uniqueness of the canonical 1-to-N virtual broadcasting map that satisfies the latter three conditions, provide its construction, and determine its sample complexity through semidefinite programming. Finally, we explore the interplay between virtual broadcasting and a quantum spacetime framework, known as the pseudodensity operator, showing that their correspondence holds only in the 1-to-2 case, underscoring the fundamental asymmetry between spatial and temporal statistics in the quantum world.

TI Sum of Entanglement and Subsystem Coherence Is Invariant under Quantum
   Reference Frame Transformations
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB Recent work on quantum reference frames (QRFs) has demonstrated that superposition and entanglement are properties that change under QRF transformations. Given their utility in quantum information processing, it is important to understand how a mere change of perspective can produce or reduce these resources. Here we prove the existence of a QRF invariant which can be decomposed such that it captures the trade-off between entanglement and subsystem coherence: we demonstrate the invariance of the sum of entanglement and subsystem coherence for two pairs of resource quantifiers. Moreover, we find a weaker trade-off that holds for any possible pair of measures. Finally, we discuss the implications of this interplay for violations of Bell's inequalities, clarifying that for any choice of QRF, there is a quantum resource responsible for the violation. These findings contribute to a better understanding of the quantum information theoretic aspects of QRFs, offering a foundation for future exploration in both quantum theory and quantum gravity.

TI Hybrid quantum architecture for smart city security
SO JOURNAL OF SYSTEMS AND SOFTWARE
AB Currently and in the near future, Smart Cities are vital to enhance urban living, address resource challenges, optimize infrastructure, and harness technology for sustainability, efficiency, and improved quality of life in rapidly urbanizing environments. Owing to the high usage of networks, sensors, and connected devices, Smart Cities generate a massive amount of data. Therefore, Smart City security concerns encompass data privacy, Internet-of-Things (IoT) vulnerabilities, cyber threats, and urban infrastructure risks, requiring robust solutions to safeguard digital assets, citizens, and critical services. Some solutions include robust cybersecurity measures, data encryption, Artificial Intelligence (AI)-driven threat detection, public-private partnerships, standardized security protocols, and community engagement to foster a resilient and secure smart city ecosystem. For example, Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) helps in real-time monitoring, threat detection, and incident response by aggregating and analyzing security data. To this end, no integrated systems are operating in this context. In this paper, we propose a Hybrid Quantum-Classical Architecture for bolstering Smart City security that exploits Quantum Machine Learning (QML) and SIEM to provide security based on Quantum Artificial Intelligence and patterns/rules. The validity of the hybrid quantum-classical architecture was proven by conducting experiments and a comparison of the QML algorithms with state-of-the-art AI algorithms. We also provide a proof of concept dashboard for the proposed architecture.

TI Ion-chain sympathetic cooling and gate dynamics
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW APPLIED
AB Sympathetic cooling is a technique often employed to mitigate motional heating in trapped-ion quantum computers. However, choosing system parameters such as number of coolants and cooling duty cycle for optimal gate performance requires evaluating trade-offs between motional errors and other slower errors such as qubit dephasing. The optimal parameters depend on cooling power, heating rate, and ion spacing in a particular system. In this study, we aim to analyze best practices for sympathetic cooling of long chains of trapped ions using analytical and computational methods. We use a case study to show that optimal cooling performance is achieved when coolants are placed at the center of the chain and provide a perturbative upper bound on the cooling limit of a mode given a particular set of cooling parameters. In addition, using computational tools, we analyze the trade-off between the number of coolant ions in a chain and the center-of-mass mode heating rate. We also show that cooling as often as possible when running a circuit is optimal when the qubit coherence time is otherwise long. These results provide a roadmap for how to choose sympathetic cooling parameters to maximize circuit performance in trapped-ion quantum computers using long chains of ions.

TI Vacuum-gap transmon qubits realized using flip-chip technology
SO APPLIED PHYSICS LETTERS
AB Significant progress has been made in building large-scale superconducting quantum processors based on flip-chip technology. In this work, we use flip-chip technology to realize a modified transmon qubit, denoted as the "flipmon, " whose large shunt capacitor is replaced by a vacuum-gap parallel plate capacitor. We place one of the qubit pads and a single Josephson junction on the bottom chip and the other pad on the top chip, which is galvanically connected with the junction through an indium bump. The electric field energy participation ratio can arrive at nearly 53% in air when the vacuum-gap is about 5 mu m, thus potentially leading to a lower dielectric loss. The coherence times of the flipmons are obtained in the range of 30-60 mu s, which are comparable with that of conventional transmons with similar fabrication processes. The electric field simulation indicates that the metal-air interface's energy participation ratio increases significantly and may dominate the flipmon's decoherence. This suggests that more careful surface treatment needs to be considered. No evidence shows that the indium bumps inside the flipmons cause significant decoherence. With well-designed geometry and good surface treatment, the coherence of the flipmons can be further improved.

TI Quantum transfer learning for acceptability judgements
SO QUANTUM MACHINE INTELLIGENCE
AB Hybrid quantum-classical classifiers promise to positively impact critical aspects of natural language processing tasks, particularly classification-related ones. Among the possibilities currently investigated, quantum transfer learning, i.e., using a quantum circuit for fine-tuning pre-trained classical models for a specific task, is attracting significant attention as a potential platform for proving quantum advantage. This work shows potential advantages, in terms of both performance and expressiveness, of quantum transfer learning algorithms trained on embedding vectors extracted from a large language model to perform classification on a classical linguistics task-acceptability judgements. Acceptability judgement is the ability to determine whether a sentence is considered natural and well-formed by a native speaker. The approach has been tested on sentences extracted from ItaCoLa, a corpus that collects Italian sentences labeled with their acceptability judgement. The evaluation phase shows results for the quantum transfer learning pipeline comparable to state-of-the-art classical transfer learning algorithms, proving current quantum computers' capabilities to tackle NLP tasks for ready-to-use applications. Furthermore, a qualitative linguistic analysis, aided by explainable AI methods, reveals the capabilities of quantum transfer learning algorithms to correctly classify complex and more structured sentences, compared to their classical counterpart. This finding sets the ground for a quantifiable quantum advantage in NLP in the near future.

TI Multi-scale feature fusion quantum depthwise Convolutional Neural
   Networks for text classification
SO ENGINEERING ANALYSIS WITH BOUNDARY ELEMENTS
AB In recent years, with the development of quantum machine learning, Quantum Neural Networks (QNNs) have gained increasing attention in the field of Natural Language Processing (NLP) and have achieved a series of promising results. However, most existing QNN models focus on the architectures of Quantum Recurrent Neural Network (QRNN) and Quantum Self-Attention Mechanism (QSAM). In this work, we propose a novel QNN model based on quantum convolution. We develop the quantum depthwise convolution that significantly reduces the number of parameters and lowers computational complexity. We also introduce the multi-scale feature fusion mechanism to enhance model performance by integrating word-level and sentence-level features. Additionally, we propose the quantum word embedding and quantum sentence embedding, which provide embedding vectors more efficiently. Through experiments on two benchmark text classification datasets, we demonstrate our model outperforms a wide range of state-of-the-art QNN models. Notably, our model achieves anew state-of-the-art test accuracy of 96.77% on the RP dataset. We also show the advantages of our quantum model over its classical counterparts in its ability to improve test accuracy using fewer parameters. Finally, an ablation test confirms the effectiveness of the multi-scale feature fusion mechanism and quantum depthwise convolution in enhancing model performance.

TI Methods of photovoltaic fault detection and classification: A review
SO ENERGY REPORTS
AB Photovoltaic (PV) fault detection and classification are essential in maintaining the reliability of the PV system (PVS). Various faults may occur in either DC or AC side of the PVS. The detection, classification, and localization of such faults are essential for mitigation, accident prevention, reduction of the loss of generated energy, and revenue. In recent years, the number of works of PV fault detection and classification has significantly increased. These works have been reviewed by considering the categorization of detection and classification techniques. This paper improves of the categorization of methods to study the faulty PVS by considering visual and thermal method and electrical based method. Moreover, an effort is made to list all potential faults in a PVS in both the DC and AC sides. Specific PV fault detection and classification techniques are also enumerated. A possible direction for research on the PV fault detection and classification, such as quantum machine learning, internet of things, and cloud/edge computing technologies, is suggested as a guide for future emerging technologies.

TI Long-range four-body interactions in structured nonlinear photonic
   waveguides
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Multiphoton dynamics beyond linear optical materials are of significant fundamental and technological importance in quantum information processing. However, it remains largely unexplored in nonlinear waveguide QED. In this work, we theoretically propose a structured nonlinear waveguide in the presence of staggered photon-photon interactions, which supports two branches of gaped bands for doublons (i.e., spatially boundphoton-pair states). In contrast to linear waveguide QED systems, we identify two important contributions to its dynamical evolution, i.e., single-photon bound states (SPBSs) and doublon bound states (DBSs). Most remarkably, the nonlinear waveguide can mediate the long-range four-body interactions between two emitter pairs, even in the presence of disturbance from SPBSs. By appropriately designing system's parameters, we can achieve high-fidelity four-body Rabi oscillations mediated only by virtual doublons in DBSs. Our findings pave the way for applying structured nonlinear waveguide QED in multi-body quantum information processing and quantum simulations among remote sites.

TI Microwave-to-optical conversion in a room-temperature 87Rb
   vapor for frequency-division multiplexing control
SO COMMUNICATIONS PHYSICS
AB Coherent microwave-to-optical conversion is crucial for transferring quantum information generated in the microwave domain to optical frequencies, where propagation losses can be minimized. Coherent, atom-based transducers have shown rapid progress in recent years. This paper reports an experimental demonstration of coherent microwave-to-optical conversion that maps a microwave signal to a large, tunable 550(30) MHz range of optical frequencies using room-temperature 87Rb atoms. The inhomogeneous Doppler broadening of the atomic vapor advantageously supports the tunability of an input microwave channel to any optical frequency channel within the Doppler width, along with the simultaneous conversion of a multi-channel input microwave field to corresponding optical channels. In addition, we demonstrate phase-correlated amplitude control of select channels, providing an analog to a frequency domain beam splitter across five orders of magnitude in frequency. With these capabilities, neutral atomic systems may also be effective quantum processors for quantum information encoded in frequency-bin qubits.

TI Hamiltonian and Liouvillian learning in weakly-dissipative quantum
   many-body systems
SO QUANTUM SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB We discuss Hamiltonian and Liouvillian learning for analog quantum simulation from non-equilibrium quench dynamics in the limit of weakly dissipative many-body systems. We present and compare various methods and strategies to learn the operator content of the Hamiltonian and the Lindblad operators of the Liouvillian. We compare different ans & auml;tze based on an experimentally accessible 'learning error' which we consider as a function of the number of runs of the experiment. Initially, the learning error decreases with the inverse square root of the number of runs, as the error in the reconstructed parameters is dominated by shot noise. Eventually the learning error remains constant, allowing us to recognize missing ansatz terms. A central aspect of our approaches is to (re-)parametrize ans & auml;tze by introducing and varying the dependencies between parameters. This allows us to identify the relevant parameters of the system, thereby reducing the complexity of the learning task. Importantly, this (re-)parametrization relies solely on classical post-processing, which is compelling given the finite amount of data available from experiments. We illustrate and compare our methods with two experimentally relevant spin models.

TI Interaction-driven transport of dark excitons in 2D semiconductors with
   phonon-mediated optical readout
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB The growing field of quantum information technology requires propagation of information over long distances with efficient readout mechanisms. Excitonic quantum fluids have emerged as a powerful platform for this task due to their straightforward electro-optical conversion. In two-dimensional transition metal dichalcogenides, the coupling between spin and valley provides exciting opportunities for harnessing, manipulating, and storing bits of information. However, the large inhomogeneity of single layers cannot be overcome by the properties of bright excitons, hindering spin-valley transport. Nonetheless, the rich band structure supports dark excitonic states with strong binding energy and longer lifetime, ideally suited for long-range transport. Here we show that dark excitons can diffuse over several micrometers and prove that this repulsion-driven propagation is robust across non-uniform samples. The long-range propagation of dark states with an optical readout mediated by chiral phonons provides a new concept of excitonic devices for applications in both classical and quantum information technology.

TI Complexity of Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill States
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW X
AB We initiate the study of state complexity for continuous-variable quantum systems. Concretely, we consider a setup with bosonic modes and auxiliary qubits, where available operations include Gaussian one-and two-mode operations and single-and two-qubit operations as well as qubit-controlled phase-space displacements. We define the (approximate) complexity of a bosonic state by the minimum size of a circuit that prepares an approximation to the state in trace distance. We propose a new circuit which prepares an approximate Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill (GKP) state GKP kappa ,Delta). Here, kappa-2 is the variance of the envelope, and Delta 2 is the variance of the individual peaks. We show that the circuit accepts with constant probability and-conditioned on acceptance-the output state is polynomially close in (kappa, Delta) to the state GKP kappa ,Delta). The size of our circuit is linear in (log 1/kappa, log 1/Delta). To our knowledge, this is the first protocol for GKPstate preparation with fidelity guarantees for the prepared state. We also show converse bounds, establishing that the linear circuit-size dependence of our construction is optimal. This fully characterizes the complexity of GKP states.

TI Identification of malfunctioning quantum devices
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB We consider the problem of correctly identifying a malfunctioning quantum device that forms part of a network of N such devices, which can be considered as the quantum analog of classical anomaly detection. In the case where the devices in question are sources assumed to prepare identical quantum pure states, with the faulty source producing a different anomalous pure state, we show that the optimal probability of successful identification requires a global quantum measurement. We also put forth several local measurement strategies-both adaptive and nonadaptive-that achieve the same optimal probability of success in the limit where the number of devices to be checked is large. In the case where the faulty device performs a known unitary operation, we show that the use of entangled probes provides an improvement that even allows perfect identification for values of the unitary parameter that surpass a certain threshold. Finally, if the faulty device implements a known qubit channel, we find that the optimal probability for detecting the position of rank-one and rank-two Pauli channels can be achieved by product state inputs and separable measurements for any size of network, whereas for rank-three and general amplitude damping channels, optimal identification requires entanglement with N qubit ancillas.

TI Topological spin textures enabling quantum transmission
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Quantum spintronics is an emerging field focused on developing novel applications by utilizing the quantum coherence of magnetic systems. A key challenge in this context is achieving scalable long-range quantum information transmission in magnetic systems. Here, we propose a novel transmission scheme based on topological spin textures in a hybrid architecture combining a magnetic racetrack and localized spin qubits. We demonstrate this principle by employing the domain wall (DW)-the most fundamental texture-to transport quantum signal between distant qubits. We introduce a measurement-free protocol that utilizes DW mobility to enable high-fidelity and tunable entanglement generation. Furthermore, we demonstrate that spin qubits can function as quantum stations on the racetrack, enabling flexible state transfer among fast-moving DWs on a single track. Finally, we discuss concrete material platforms to implement the proposed scheme. Our work introduces a new hybrid quantum platform that merges topological spin textures with solid-state qubits, offering a scalable architecture for quantum information processing and opening promising directions for quantum spintronics.

TI Probing fractal spatiotemporal inhomogeneity in a quantum walk
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB We investigate the transport and entanglement properties exhibited by quantum walks with coin operators concatenated in a space-time fractal structure. Inspired by recent developments in photonics, we choose the paradigmatic Sierpinski gasket. The 0-1 pattern of the fractal is mapped into an alternation of the generalized Hadamard-Fourier operators. This two-state coin-operator approach overcomes the intricacies caused by the utilization of high-dimensional coin operators required in prior studies of discrete-time quantum walks on fractals. In fulfilling the blank space on the analysis of the impact of inhomogeneity in quantum walk properties, specifically, fractal deterministic inhomogeneity, our results show a robust effect of entanglement enhancement as well as an interesting road to superdiffusive spreading with a tunable scaling exponent attaining robust superdiffusion, subballistic though. Explicitly, with this fractal approach it is possible to obtain an increase in quantum entanglement with reduced impact on standard quantum walk theoretical spreading. Alongside those features, we analyze further properties such as the degree of interference and visibility. The present model corresponds to an application of fractals in an experimentally viable setting, namely, the building block for the construction of photonic patterned structures.

TI Mode entanglement in fermionic and bosonic Harmonium
SO NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB Mode entanglement in many-body quantum systems is an active area of research. It provides crucial insight into the suitability of many-body systems for quantum information processing tasks. Local super-selection rules must be taken into account when assessing the amount of physically accessible entanglement. This requires amending well-established entanglement measures by incorporating local parity and local particle number constraints. In this paper, we report on mode entanglement present in the analytically solvable system of N-Harmonium. To the knowledge of the authors, this is the first analytic study of the physically accessible mode and mode-mode entanglement of an interacting many-body system in a continuous state space. We find that super-selection rules dramatically reduce the amount of physically accessible entanglement, which vanishes entirely in some cases. Our results strongly suggest the need to re-evaluate intra and inter-mode entanglement in other fermionic and bosonic systems.

TI Fisher Information as General Metrics of Quantum Synchronization
SO ENTROPY
AB Quantum synchronization has emerged as a crucial phenomenon in quantum nonlinear dynamics with potential applications in quantum information processing. Multiple measures for quantifying quantum synchronization exist. However, there is currently no widely agreed metric that is universally adopted. In this paper, we propose using classical and quantum Fisher information (FI) as alternative metrics to detect and measure quantum synchronization. We establish the connection between FI and quantum synchronization, demonstrating that both classical and quantum FI can be deployed as more general indicators of quantum phase synchronization in some regimes where all other existing measures fail to provide reliable results. We show advantages in FI-based measures, especially in 2-to-1 synchronization. Furthermore, we analyze the impact of noise on the synchronization measures, revealing the robustness and susceptibility of each method in the presence of dissipation and decoherence. Our results open up new avenues for understanding and exploiting quantum synchronization.

TI Generating Haar-Uniform Randomness Using Stochastic Quantum Walks on a
   Photonic Chip
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB As random operations for quantum systems are intensively used in various quantum information tasks, a trustworthy measure of the randomness in quantum operations is highly demanded. The Haar measure of randomness is a useful tool with wide applications, such as boson sampling. Recently, a theoretical protocol was proposed to combine quantum control theory and driven stochastic quantum walks to generate Haar uniform random operations. This opens up a promising route to converting classical randomness to quantum randomness. Here, we implement a two-dimensional stochastic quantum walk on the integrated photonic chip and demonstrate that the average of all distribution profiles converges to the even distribution when the evolution length increases, suggesting the 1-pad Haar-uniform randomness. We further show that our two-dimensional array outperforms the one-dimensional array of the same number of waveguide for the speed of convergence. Our Letter demonstrates a scalable and robust way to generate Haar-uniform randomness that can provide useful building blocks to boost future quantum information techniques.

TI An improved novel quantum image representation and its experimental test

SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB Quantum image representation (QIR) is a necessary part of quantum image processing (QIP) and plays an important role in quantum information processing. To address the problems that NCQI cannot handle images with inconsistent horizontal and vertical position sizes and multi-channel image processing, an improved color digital image quantum representation (INCQI) model based on NCQI is proposed in this paper. The INCQI model can process color images and facilitate multi-channel quantum image transformations and transparency information processing of images using auxiliary quantum bits. In addition, the quantum image control circuit was designed based on INCQI. And quantum image preparation experiments were conducted on IBM Quantum Experience (IBMQ) to verify the feasibility and effectiveness of INCQI quantum image preparation. The prepared image information was obtained by quantum measurement in the experiment, and the visualization of quantum information was successfully realized. The research in this paper has some reference value for the research related to QIP.

TI Moire heterostructures as a condensed-matter quantum simulator
SO NATURE PHYSICS
AB Twisted van der Waals heterostructures have latterly received prominent attention for their many remarkable experimental properties and the promise that they hold for realizing elusive states of matter in the laboratory. We propose that these systems can, in fact, be used as a robust quantum simulation platform that enables the study of strongly correlated physics and topology in quantum materials. Among the features that make these materials a versatile toolbox are the tunability of their properties through readily accessible external parameters such as gating, straining, packing and twist angle; the feasibility to realize and control a large number of fundamental many-body quantum models relevant in the field of condensed-matter physics; and finally, the availability of experimental readout protocols that directly map their rich phase diagrams in and out of equilibrium. This general framework makes it possible to robustly realize and functionalize new phases of matter in a modular fashion, thus broadening the landscape of accessible physics and holding promise for future technological applications.
   Moire heterostructures have latterly captured the attention of condensed-matter physicists. This Review Article explores the idea of adopting them as a quantum simulation platform that enables the study of strongly correlated physics and topology in quantum materials.

TI Robust dynamical and steady-state entanglement of phonons in the
   magnetic microsphere
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB In the field of quantum information, robust entanglement has received widespread attention. In this work, we investigate the magnon-mediated robust entanglement between the acoustic phonon and the center-of-mass motion (CMM) phonon in a yttrium iron garnet sphere. By analyzing the system's dynamic evolution, we demonstrate that phonon-phonon entanglement, which is robust with respect to the magnon mode, can be generated at a specific moment. Furthermore, we introduce a scheme for generating stable bipartite entanglement that remains robust against varying initial states by utilizing an engineered reservoir. This approach maintains effectiveness even under high dissipation rates of the magnon mode, leveraging the magnon dissipation as a beneficial resource. The approaches we present for generating robust phonon-phonon entanglement not only offer a feasible method for monitoring internal acoustic modes within magnetic systems using easily detectable CMM phonons, but also provide a viable platform for the manipulation and processing of quantum information.

TI Towards a quantum decision tree in a laser pumped four-level system
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICS COMMUNICATIONS
AB In this study, we examine an innovative framework towards implementing quantum decision trees utilizing a laser-driven four-level system. We discuss a diamond-shaped atomic configuration, in which we apply Lie-algebraic formalisms to analyze the dynamics of the system. The system is perturbed by a Stokes pulse, represented as beta j(t) (for j = 1, 2), which interacts with the atomic states divided by 0 >, divided by 3 > and divided by 1 >, divided by 2 >. In addition, a pump laser, denoted as alpha j(t), couples the states divided by 0 >, divided by 1 > and divided by 2 >, divided by 3 >. By employing pulse profiles that possess identical temporal behavior but differ in amplitude, one can effectively redistribute the population from the initial ground state to the other energy levels. This technique facilitates the mimicry of a quantum decision tree. We highlight that the proposed methodology is scalable to N-level systems, enhancing its adaptability and potential utility in quantum computing and various decision-making applications. We introduce a novel framework for implementing quantum decision trees using a four-level laser-driven atomic system. Employing a diamond-shaped energy configuration, we analyze system dynamics through Lie-algebraic methods. The system's interactions are mediated by Stokes pulses, beta j(t) (for j = 1, 2), coupling states divided by 0 > <-> divided by 3 > and divided by 1 > <-> divided by 2 >, alongside pump pulses, alpha j(t), facilitating transitions between divided by 0 > <-> divided by 1 > and divided by 2 > <-> divided by 3 >. Using pulse profiles with identical temporal structures but varying amplitudes, we achieve controlled population redistribution among energy levels, effectively simulating a quantum decision tree. This methodology is scalable to systems of N levels, offering potential applications in quantum computing and decision-making processes.

TI Real-Time Feedback Control of Charge Sensing for Quantum Dot Qubits
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW APPLIED
AB Measurement of charge configurations in few-electron quantum dots is a vital technique for spin-based quantum information processing. While fast and high-fidelity measurement is possible by using proximal quantum dot charge sensors, their operating range is limited and prone to electrical disturbances. Here we demonstrate real-time operation of a charge sensor in a feedback loop to maintain its sensitivity suitable for fast charge sensing in a Si/Si0.7Ge0.3 double quantum dot. Disturbances to the charge sensitivity, due to variation of gate voltages for operating the quantum dot and 1/f charge fluctuation, are compensated by a digital proportional-integral-differential controller with the bandwidth of approximately equal to 100 kHz. The rapid automated tuning of a charge sensor enables unobstructed charge-stabilitydiagram measurement facilitating real-time quantum dot tuning and submicrosecond single-shot spin readout without compromising the performance of a charge sensor in time-consuming experiments for quantum information processing.

TI Devitalizing noise-driven instability of entangling logic in silicon
   devices with bias controls
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB The quality of quantum bits (qubits) in silicon is highly vulnerable to charge noise that is omnipresent in semiconductor devices and is in principle hard to be suppressed. For a realistically sized quantum dot system based on a silicon-germanium heterostructure whose confinement is manipulated with electrical biases imposed on top electrodes, we computationally explore the noise-robustness of 2-qubit entangling operations with a focus on the controlled-X (CNOT) logic that is essential for designs of gate-based universal quantum logic circuits. With device simulations based on the physics of bulk semiconductors augmented with electronic structure calculations, we not only quantify the degradation in fidelity of single-step CNOT operations with respect to the strength of charge noise, but also discuss a strategy of device engineering that can significantly enhance noise-robustness of CNOT operations with almost no sacrifice of speed compared to the single-step case. Details of device designs and controls that this work presents can establish practical guideline for potential efforts to secure silicon-based quantum processors using an electrode-driven quantum dot platform.

TI Unconventional skin modes in generalized topolectrical circuits with
   multiple asymmetric couplings
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB The eigennmodes in a non-Hermitian system containing nonreciprocal couplings may exhibit an extreme localization, also known as non-Hermitian skin effect (NHSE), under open boundary conditions. Here, we ex-plore unconventional scenarios where the interplay between multiple asymmetric couplings can cause the NHSE to vanish, unlike in known models with nonreciprocal couplings, where the NHSE vanishes only when the non-Hermiticity is turned off. We derive general conditions for the NHSE in a non-Hermitian superlattice in which the overall eigenmode localization is determined by the geometric mean of the cumulative contributions of all asymmetric coupling segments. In the limit of large unit cells, our results provide a route towards the NHSE caused by asymmetric hopping textures, rather than single asymmetric hoppings. We provide explicit electrical circuit setups for realizing our observations, which also extend to other established platforms such as photonics, mechanics, and optics systems, and quantum circuits.

TI Closed-loop optimization for high-fidelity controlled-Z gates in
   superconducting qubits
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW APPLIED
AB Achieving fast and high-fidelity qubit operations is crucial for unlocking the potential of quantum computers. In particular, reaching low gate errors in two-qubit gates has been a long-standing challenge in the field of superconducting qubits due to their typically long duration relative to coherence times. To realize fast gates, we use the hybridization between fixed-frequency superconducting qubits with a strongly interacting coupler mode that is tunable in frequency. To reduce population leakage during required adiabatic passages through avoided level crossings, we employ a sensitivity-adaptive closed-loop optimization method to design complex pulse shapes. We compare the performance of Gaussian-square, Fourier-series, and piecewise-constant-slope pulse parametrizations and are able to reach 99.9% controlled-Z-gate fidelity using a 64-ns-long Fourier-series pulse defined by only seven parameters. These high-fidelity values are achieved by analyzing the optimized pulse shapes to identify and systematically mitigate signal-line distortions in the experiment. To improve the convergence speed of the optimization, we implement an adaptive cost function, which continuously maximizes the sensitivity. The demonstrated method can be used for tune-up and recalibration of superconducting quantum processors.

TI Frequency estimation under non-Markovian spatially correlated quantum
   noise
SO NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB We study the estimation precision attainable by entanglement-enhanced Ramsey interferometry in the presence of spatiotemporally correlated non-classical noise. Our analysis relies on an exact expression of the reduced density matrix of the qubit probes under general zero-mean Gaussian stationary dephasing, which is established through cumulant-expansion techniques and may be of independent interest in the context of non-Markovian open dynamics. By continuing and expanding our previous work (Beaudoin et al 2018 Phys. Rev. A 98 020102(R)), we analyze the effects of a non-collective coupling regime between the qubit probes and their environment, focusing on two limiting scenarios where the couplings may take only two or a continuum of possible values. In the paradigmatic case of spin-boson dephasing noise from a thermal environment, we find that it is in principle possible to suppress, on average, the effect of spatial correlations by randomizing the location of the probes, as long as enough configurations are sampled where noise correlations are negative. As a result, superclassical precision scaling is asymptotically restored for initial entangled states, including experimentally accessible one-axis spin-squeezed states.

TI Controlling Two-Dimensional Coulomb Crystals of More Than 100 Ions in a
   Monolithic Radio-Frequency Trap
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB Linear strings of trapped atomic ions held in radio-frequency (rf) traps constitute one of the leading platforms for quantum simulation experiments, allowing the investigation of interacting quantum matter. However, linear ion strings have drawbacks, such as the difficulty of scaling beyond approximately 50 particles as well as the inability to naturally implement spin models with more than one spatial dimension. Here we present experiments with planar Coulomb crystals of up to 105 40Ca+ ions in a novel monolithic rf trap, laying the groundwork for quantum simulations of two-dimensional spin models with single -particle control. We characterize the trapping potential by analysis of crystal images and compare the observed crystal configurations with numerical simulations. We further demonstrate stable confinement of large crystals, free of structural configuration changes, and find that rf heating of the crystal is not an obstacle for future quantum simulation experiments. Finally, we prepare the out-of-plane motional modes of planar crystals consisting of up to 105 ions close to their ground state by electromagnetically induced transparency cooling, an important prerequisite for implementing long-range entangling interactions.

TI All-dry pick-up and transfer method for quantum emitter arrays in
   hexagonal boron nitride
SO APL PHOTONICS
AB Single photon emitters in hexagonal boron nitride are based on fluorescent point-like defects. These defects possess exceptional photophysical properties and have been the focus of research for their potential to advance photonic quantum technologies. However, achieving scalable integration of these emitters onto arbitrary platforms with high yield while retaining their characteristics remains challenging when the substrate is incompatible with the fabrication method. In this work, we introduce an all-dry transfer method that addresses these challenges more effectively than existing techniques. This polymer stamp-assisted transfer maintains high output and preserves emitter characteristics while eliminating wet chemical processes. Comprehensive post-transfer characterization verified retention of the defining single-photon characteristic, the second-order correlation function g((2))(0), and revealed an improvement of about 46%. This enhancement in photon purity may result from thermal desorption of weak surface contaminants during mild heating and from changes in local stress and strain induced by the transfer process. While g((2))(0) showed substantial improvement, other photophysical properties, such as emitter lifetime, emission spectrum, and photostability, remained nearly unchanged, indicating that the transfer preserves the overall optical quality. The technique achieves emitter survival probability of 81.8%, where success requires both the structural integrity of the transferred flake and the survival of the emitters with their defining optical properties. This high survival probability demonstrates the potential to scale the integration of single photon emitters across diverse photonic platforms. We expect that this process will contribute to applications of boron nitride defects in quantum technologies.

TI Survey of Quantum Generative Adversarial Networks (QGAN) to Generate
   Images
SO MATHEMATICS
AB Quantum Generative Adversarial Networks (QGANs) represent a useful development in quantum machine learning, using the particular properties of quantum mechanics to solve the challenges of data analysis and modeling. This paper brings up a general analysis of five QGAN architectures, focusing on their evolution, strengths, weaknesses, and limitations in noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices. Primary methods like Entangling Quantum GAN (EQ-GAN) and Quantum state fidelity (QuGAN) concentrate on stability, convergence, and robust performance on small-scale datasets such as 2 x 2 grayscale images. Intermediate models such as Image Quantum GAN (IQGAN) and Experimental Quantum GAN (EXQGAN) provide new ideas like trainable encoders and patch-based sub-generators that are scalable to 8 x 8 datasets with increasing noise resilience. The most advanced method is Parameterized Quantum Wasserstein GAN (PQWGAN), which uses a hybrid quantum-classical structure to obtain high-resolution image processing for 28 x 28 grayscale datasets while trying to maintain parameter efficiency. This study explores, analyzes, and summarizes critical problems of QGANs, including accuracy, convergence, parameter efficiency, image quality, performance metrics, and training stability under noisy conditions. In addition, developing QGANs can generate and train parameters in quantum approximation optimization algorithms. One of the useful applications of QGAN is generating medical datasets that can generate medical images from limited datasets to train specific medical models for the recognition of diseases.

TI Resource speed limits: maximal rate of resource variation
SO NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB Recent advances in quantum resource theories have been driven by the fact that many quantum information protocols make use of different facets of the same physical features, e.g. entanglement, coherence, etc. Resource theories formalise the role of these important physical features in a given protocol. One question that remains open until now is: how quickly can a resource be generated or degraded? Using the toolkit of quantum speed limits we construct bounds on the minimum time required for a given resource to change by a fixed increment, which might be thought of as the power of said resource, i.e., the rate of resource variation. We show that the derived bounds are tight by considering several examples. Finally, we discuss some applications of our results, which include generalisations of thermodynamic work, heat, and power to any given resource, as well as fundamental bounds on the computation rate in leading quantum processing architectures.

TI Surface Stabilization to Enhance Single Molecule Toroidal Behavior in
   {Dy3} Molecules: the Impact of Au(111), MgO, and Graphene
   Surfaces
SO SMALL
AB Single-molecule toroids (SMTs), with vortex-like magnetic anisotropy axes, hold promise for quantum technologies, but controlling their toroidal states on the surface remains challenging. To address this, the SMT behavior of [Dy3(mu 3-OH)2L3Cl(H2O)5]Cl3 (where L = ortho-vanillin) grafted onto Au(111), MgO has been studied, and graphene surfaces in pristine form (1) and with pyrene (2) and (CH2)8S (3) linkers, using periodic density functional theory and ab initio CASSCF/RASSI-SO methods. Both pristine and chemically functionalized molecules are stable on Au(111) and graphene surfaces; however, functionalization provides higher binding energies and, in some cases, enhances the SMT properties. The MgO surface, however, is found to be unsuitable as it abstracts an H atom from the molecule, leading to the loss of its SMT characteristics. The energy gap (Delta E) between the toroidal (nonmagnetic) and spin-flip (magnetic) states in complex 1 on Au(111) and graphene surfaces are 6.9 and 6.6 cm-1, respectively. Complexes 2 on Au(111) and 3 on graphene exhibit Delta E and toroidal blocking fields of 9.8 cm-1/1.2 T and 6.8 cm-1/0.83 T, respectively, representing the highest recorded values for this class of SMTs. These findings demonstrate the potential of surface stabilization to improve the functionality and applicability of SMTs in advanced quantum technologies.

TI Protecting gauge symmetries in the dynamics of SU(3) lattice gauge
   theories
SO COMMUNICATIONS PHYSICS
AB Quantum simulation of a lattice gauge theory demands imposing on-site constraints. Ideally, the dynamics remain confined within the physical Hilbert space, where all the states satisfy those constraints. For a non-Abelian gauge theory, implementing these local Gauss' law constraints is non-trivial. The presence of noise in current quantum devices further complicates efforts to confine the theory to the physical Hilbert space. The SU(3) gauge theory, describing the strong interaction of nature contains 8 mutually non-commuting local constraints. An efficient Hamiltonian simulation for the same should preserve all of these simultaneously - which stands as a notoriously difficult task. In this work, we explore two symmetry protection protocols for simulating SU(3) gauge theory in 1+1 dimensions. The first protocol does not require the imposition of any local symmetry but relies on protecting global symmetries, which are Abelian within the preferred choice of framework, namely the loop-string-hadron framework. The second protocol employs a protection scheme that is local, Abelian, and generalizable to higher dimensions. The symmetry protection schemes presented here are important steps towards quantum simulating the full theory of Quantum Chromodynamics.

TI Ultrafast all-optical measurement of squeezed vacuum in a lithium
   niobate nanophotonic circuit
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Squeezed vacuum, a fundamental resource for continuous-variable quantum information processing, has been used to demonstrate quantum advantages in sensing, communication, and computation. While most experiments use homodyne detection to characterize squeezing and are therefore limited to electronic bandwidths, recent experiments have shown optical parametric amplification (OPA) to be a viable measurement strategy. Here, we realize OPA-based quantum state tomography in integrated photonics and demonstrate the generation and all-optical Wigner tomography of squeezed vacuum in a nanophotonic circuit. We employ dispersion engineering to enable the distortion-free propagation of femtosecond pulses and achieve ultrabroad operation bandwidths, effectively lifting the speed restrictions imposed by traditional electronics on quantum measurements with a theoretical maximum clock speed of 6.5 THz. We implement our circuit on thin-film lithium niobate, a platform compatible with a wide variety of active and passive photonic components. Our results chart a course for realizing all-optical ultrafast quantum information processing in an integrated room-temperature platform.

TI Controllable transitions among phase-matching conditions in a single
   nonlinear crystal
SO CHINESE OPTICS LETTERS
AB Entangled photon pairs are crucial resources for quantum information processing protocols. Via the process of spontaneous parametric downconversion (SPDC), we can generate these photon pairs using bulk nonlinear crystals. Traditionally, the crystal is designed to satisfy a specific type of phase-matching condition. Here, we report controllable transitions among different types of phase matching in a single periodically poled potassium titanyl phosphate crystal. By carefully selecting pump conditions, we can satisfy different phase-matching conditions. This allows us to observe first-order Type-II, fifth-order Type-I, third-order Type-0, and fifth-order Type-II SPDCs. The temperature-dependent spectra of our source were also analyzed in detail. Finally, we discussed the possibility of observing more than nine SPDCs in this crystal. Our work not only deepens the understanding of the physics behind phase-matching conditions, but also offers the potential for a highly versatile entangled biphoton source for quantum information research.

TI Multiparallel MMT: Faster ISD Algorithm Solving High-Dimensional
   Syndrome Decoding Problem
SO IEICE TRANSACTIONS ON FUNDAMENTALS OF ELECTRONICS COMMUNICATIONS AND
   COMPUTER SCIENCES
AB The hardness of the syndrome decoding problem (SDP) is the primary evidence for the security of code-based cryptosystems, which are one of the finalists in a project to standardize post-quantum cryptography conducted by the U.S. National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST-PQC). Information set decoding (ISD) is a general term for algorithms that solve SDP efficiently. In this paper, we conducted a concrete analysis of the time complexity of the latest ISD algorithms under the limitation of memory using the syndrome decoding estimator proposed by Esser et al. As a result, we present that theoretically nonoptimal ISDs, such as May-Meurer-Thomae (MMT) and May-Ozerov, have lower time complexity than other ISDs in some actual SDP instances. Based on these facts, we further studied the possibility of multiple parallelization for these ISDs and proposed the first GPU algorithm for MMT, the multiparallel MMT algorithm. In the experiments, we show that the multiparallel MMT algorithm is faster than existing ISD algorithms. In addition, we report the first successful attempts to solve the 510-, 530-, 540-and 550-dimensional SDP instances in the Decoding Challenge contest using the multiparallel MMT.

AB Polynomial multiplication is one of the most costly operations of ideal lattice-based cryptosystems. In this work, we study its optimizations when one of the operands has coefficients close to 0. We focus on this structure since it is at the core of lattice-based Key Encapsulation Mechanisms submitted to the NIST call for post-quantum cryptography. In particular, we propose optimization of this operation for embedded devices by using a RSA/ECC coprocessor that provides efficient and secure large-integer arithmetic. In this context, we compare Kronecker Substitution, already studied in [AHH+19], with two specific algorithms that we introduce: KSV, a variant of this substitution, and an adaptation of the schoolbook multiplication, denoted Shift&Add. All these algorithms rely on the transformation of polynomial multiplication to large-integer arithmetic. Then, thanks to these algorithms, existing secure coprocessors dedicated to large-integer can be re-purposed in order to speed-up post-quantum schemes. The efficiency of these algorithms depends on the component specifications and the cryptosystem parameters set. Thus, we establish a methodology to determine which algorithm to use, for a given component, by only implementing basic large-integer operations. Moreover, the three algorithms are assessed on a chip ensuring that the theoretical methodology matches with practical results.

TI Stabilizer extent is not multiplicative
SO QUANTUM
AB The Gottesman-Knill theorem states that a Clifford circuit acting on stabilizer states can be simulated efficiently on a classical computer. Recently, this result has been generalized to cover inputs that are close to a coherent superposition of polynomially many stabilizer states. The runtime of the classical simulation is governed by the stabilizer extent, which roughly measures how many stabilizer states are needed to approximate the state. An important open problem is to decide whether the extent is multiplicative under tensor products. An affirmative answer would yield an efficient algorithm for computing the extent of product inputs, while a negative result implies the existence of more efficient classical algorithms for simulating large-scale quantum circuits. Here, we answer this question in the negative. Our result follows from very general properties of the set of stabilizer states, such as having a size that scales subexponentially in the dimension, and can thus be readily adapted to similar constructions for other resource theories.

TI Delocalized and dynamical catalytic randomness and information flow
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB We generalize the theory of catalytic quantum randomness to distributed and dynamical settings. First, we expand the theory of catalytic quantum randomness by calculating the amount of (Renyi) entropy catalytically extractable from a distributed or dynamical randomness source. We show that no entropy can be catalytically extracted when one cannot implement local projective measurement on randomness source without altering its state. As an application, we prove that quantum operation cannot be hidden in correlation between two parties without using randomness, which is the dynamical generalization of the no-hiding theorem. Moreover, the formalism of distributed catalysis is applied to develop a formal definition of semantic quantum information and it follows that utilizing semantic information is equivalent to catalysis using a catalyst already correlated with the transforming system. By doing so, we unify the utilization of semantic and nonsemantic quantum information and conclude that one can always extract more information from an incompletely depleted classical randomness source, but it is not possible for quantum randomness sources.

TI High-energy quasiparticle injection into mesoscopic superconductors
SO NATURE NANOTECHNOLOGY
AB At non-zero temperatures, superconductors contain excitations known as Bogoliubov quasiparticles (QPs). The mesoscopic dynamics of QPs inform the design of quantum information processors, among other devices. Knowledge of these dynamics stems from experiments in which QPs are injected in a controlled fashion, typically at energies comparable to the pairing energy(1-5). Here we perform tunnel spectroscopy of a mesoscopic superconductor under high electric fields. We observe QP injection due to field-emitted electrons with 10(6) times the pairing energy, an unexplored regime of QP dynamics. Upon application of a gate voltage, the QP injection decreases the critical current and, at sufficiently high electric field, a field-emission current (<0.1 nA in our device) switches the mesoscopic superconductor into the normal state, consistent with earlier observations(6). We expect that high-energy injection will be useful for developing QP-tolerant quantum information processors, will allow rapid control of resonator quality factors and will enable the design of electric-field-controlled superconducting devices with new functionality.

TI Concept of Orbital Entanglement and Correlation in Quantum Chemistry
SO JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL THEORY AND COMPUTATION
AB A recent development in quantum chemistry has established the quantum mutual information between orbitals as a major descriptor of electronic structure. This has already facilitated remarkable improvements in numerical methods and may lead to a more comprehensive foundation for chemical bonding theory. Building on this promising development, our work provides a refined discussion of quantum information theoretical concepts by introducing the physical correlation and its separation into classical and quantum parts as distinctive quantifiers of electronic structure. In particular, we succeed in quantifying the entanglement. Intriguingly, our results for different molecules reveal that the total correlation between orbitals is mainly classical, raising questions about the general significance of entanglement in chemical bonding. Our work also shows that implementing the fundamental particle number superselection rule, so far not accounted for in quantum chemistry, removes a major part of correlation and entanglement seen previously. In that respect, realizing quantum information processing tasks with molecular systems might be more challenging than anticipated.

TI Surpassing spectator qubits with photonic modes and continuous
   measurement for Heisenberg-limited noise mitigation
SO NPJ QUANTUM INFORMATION
AB Noise is an ever-present challenge to the creation and preservation of fragile quantum states. Recent work suggests that spatial noise correlations can be harnessed as a resource for noise mitigation via the use of spectator qubits to measure environmental noise. In this work we generalize this concept from spectator qubits to a spectator mode: a photonic mode which continuously measures spatially correlated classical dephasing noise and applies a continuous correction drive to frequency-tunable data qubits. Our analysis shows that by using many photon states, spectator modes can surpass many of the quantum measurement constraints that limit spectator qubit approaches. We also find that long-time data qubit dephasing can be arbitrarily suppressed, even for white noise dephasing. Further, using a squeezing (parametric) drive, the error in the spectator mode approach can exhibit Heisenberg-limited scaling in the number of photons used. We also show that spectator mode noise mitigation can be implemented completely autonomously using engineered dissipation. In this case no explicit measurement or processing of a classical measurement record is needed. Our work establishes spectator modes as a potentially powerful alternative to spectator qubits for noise mitigation.

TI Quantum dynamics of disordered arrays of interacting superconducting
   qubits: Signatures of quantum collective states
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
AB We study theoretically the collective quantum dynamics occurring in various interacting superconducting qubit arrays (SQAs) in the presence of a spread of individual qubit frequencies. The interaction is provided by mutual inductive coupling between adjacent qubits (short-range Ising interaction) or inductive coupling to a low-dissipative resonator (long-range exchange interaction). In the absence of interaction, the Fourier transform of the temporal correlation function of the total polarization (z projection of the total spin), i.e., the dynamic susceptibility C(omega), demonstrates a set of sharp small magnitude resonances corresponding to the transitions of individual superconducting qubits. We show that even a weak interaction between qubits can overcome the disorder with a simultaneous formation of the collective excited states. This collective behavior manifests itself by a single large resonance in C(omega). In the presence of a weak nonresonant microwave photon field in the low-dissipative resonator, the positions of dominant resonances depend on the number of photons, i.e., the collective ac Stark effect. Coupling of an SQA to the transmission line allows a straightforward experimental access of the collective states in microwave transmission experiments and, at the same time, to employ SQAs as sensitive single-photon detectors.

TI Intelligent certification for quantum simulators via machine learning
SO NPJ QUANTUM INFORMATION
AB Quantum simulation is a technology of using controllable quantum systems to study new quantum phases of matter. Certification for quantum simulators is a challenging problem whereas identification and properties estimation are two crucial approaches that can be resorted to. In this work, we propose Ab initio end-to-end machine learning certification protocol briefly named MLCP. The learning protocol is trained with a million-level size of randomized measurement samples without relying on the assistance of quantum tomography. In the light of MLCP, we can identify different types of quantum simulators to observe their distinguishability hardness. We also predict the physical properties of quantum states evolved in quantum simulators such as entanglement entropy and maximum fidelity. The impact of randomized measurement samples on the identification accuracy is analyzed to showcase the potential capability of classical machine learning on quantum simulation results. The entanglement entropy and maximum fidelity with varied subsystem partitions are also estimated with satisfactory precision. This work paves the way for large-scale intelligent certification of quantum simulators and can be extended onto an artificial intelligence center to offer easily accessible services for local quantum simulators in the noisy intermediate-size quantum (NISQ) era.

TI Quantum phases of spin-1/2 extended XY model in transverse magnetic
   field
SO PHYSICA SCRIPTA
AB In this study, a spin-1/2 extended anisotropic XY chain has been introduced in which both time reversal and SU(2) symmetries are broken but Z 2 symmetry is preserved. Magnetic and topological phase diagrams in the parameter space have been drawn in the presence of transverse magnetic field. Entanglement measures like mutual information and quantum discord are also evaluated and it indicates that these transitions are second order in nature. Quantum phase transition is noted at zero magnetic field, as well as magnetic long range order is found to withstand magnetic field of any strength. Exact analytic results for spin-spin correlation functions have been obtained in terms of Jordan-Wigner fermionization. Existence of long range magnetic order has been investigated numerically by finding correlation functions as well as the Binder cumulant in the ground state. Dispersion relation, ground state energy, and energy gap are obtained analytically. In order to find the topologically nontrivial phase, sign of Pfaffian invariant and value of winding number have been evaluated. Both magnetic and topological phases are robust against the magnetic field and found to move coercively in the parameter space with the variation of its strength. Long range orders along two orthogonal directions and two different topological phases are found and their one-to-one correspondence has been found. Finally casting the spinless fermions onto Majorana fermions, properties of zero energy edge states are studied. Three different kinds of Majorana pairings are noted. In the trivial phase, next-nearest-neighbor Majorana pairing is found, whereas two different types of nearest-neighbor Majorana pairings are identified in the topological superconducting phase.

TI Conditional preparation of non-Gaussian quantum optical states by
   mesoscopic measurement
SO NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB Non-Gaussian states of an optical field are important as a proposed resource in quantum information applications. While conditional preparation is a highly successful approach to preparing such states, their quality is limited by detector non-idealities such as dead time, narrow dynamic range, limited quantum efficiency and dark noise. Mesoscopic photon counters, with peak performance at higher photon number, offer many practical advantages over single-photon level conditioning detectors. Here we propose a novel approach involving displacement of the ancilla field into the regime where mesoscopic detectors can be used. We explore this strategy theoretically and present simulations accounting for experimental non-idealities such as loss and amplification noise, showing that precise photon-number resolution is not necessary to herald highly nonclassical states. We conclude that states with strong Wigner negativity can be prepared at high rates by this technique under experimentally attainable conditions.

TI Traceable localization enables accurate integration of quantum emitters

SO OPTICA QUANTUM
AB In a popular integration process for quantum information technologies, localization microscopy of quantum emitters guides lithographic placement of photonic structures. However, a complex coupling of microscopy and lithography errors degrades registration accuracy, severely limiting device performance and process yield. We introduce a methodology to solve this widespread but poorly understood problem. A new foundation of traceable localization enables rapid characterization of lithographic standards and comprehensive calibration of cryogenic microscopes, revealing and correcting latent systematic effects. Of particular concern, we discover that scale factor deviation and complex optical distortion couple to dominate registration errors. These novel results parameterize a process model for integrating quantum dots and bullseye resonators, predicting higher yield by orders of magnitude, depending on the Purcell factor threshold as a quantum performance metric. Our foundational methodology is a key enabler of the lab-to-fab transition of quantum information technologies and has broader implications to cryogenic and correlative microscopy.

TI Generation of highly pure single-photon state at telecommunication
   wavelength
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB Telecommunication wavelength with well-developed optical communication technologies and low losses in the waveguide are advantageous for quantum applications. However, an experimental generation of non-classical states called non-Gaussian states at the telecommunication wavelength is still underdeveloped. Here, we generate highly-pure-single-photon states, one of the most primitive non-Gaussian states, by using a heralding scheme with an optical parametric oscillator and a superconducting nano-strip photon detector. The Wigner negativity, the indicator of non-classicality, of the generated single photon state is -0.228 +/- 0.004, corresponded to 85.1 +/- 0.7% of single photon and the best record of the minimum value at all wavelengths. The quantum-optics-technology we establish can be easily applied to the generation of various types of quantum states, opening up the possibility of continuous-variable-quantum-information processing at the telecommunication wavelength.

TI Probabilistic state synthesis based on optimal convex approximation
SO NPJ QUANTUM INFORMATION
AB When preparing a pure state with a quantum circuit, there is an unavoidable approximation error due to the compilation error in fault-tolerant implementation. A recently proposed approach called probabilistic state synthesis, where the circuit is probabilistically sampled, is able to reduce the approximation error compared to conventional deterministic synthesis. In this paper, we demonstrate that the optimal probabilistic synthesis quadratically reduces the approximation error. Moreover, we show that a deterministic synthesis algorithm can be efficiently converted into a probabilistic one that achieves this quadratic error reduction. We also numerically demonstrate how this conversion reduces the T-count and analytically prove that this conversion halves an information-theoretic lower bound on the circuit size. In order to derive these results, we prove general theorems about the optimal convex approximation of a quantum state. Furthermore, we demonstrate that this theorem can be used to analyze an entanglement measure.

TI Long-time memory effects in a localizable central spin problem
SO NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB We study the properties of the Nakajima-Zwanzig memory kernel for a qubit immersed in a many-body localized (i.e. disordered and interacting) bath. We argue that the memory kernel decays as a power law in both the localized and ergodic regimes, and show how this can be leveraged to extract t -> infinity populations for the qubit from finite time (Jt <= 10(2)) data in the thermalizing phase. This allows us to quantify how the long-time values of the populations approach the expected thermalized state as the bath approaches the thermodynamic limit. This approach should provide a good complement to state-of-the-art numerical methods, for which the long-time dynamics with large baths are impossible to simulate in this phase. Additionally, our numerics on finite baths reveal the possibility for unbounded exponential growth in the memory kernel, a phenomenon rooted in the appearance of exceptional points in the projected Liouvillian governing the reduced dynamics. In small systems amenable to exact numerics, we find that these pathologies may have some correlation with delocalization.

TI Fermionic entanglement in altermagnets
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
AB Altermagnetism became very popular because of unique features, namely coupling between magnetic properties and momentum of itinerant electrons. The particular model of the altermagnetic system of our interest has already been studied in recent publications in a different context: Phys. Rev. B 108, L140408 (2023). Here, we study the scattering process of an itinerant electron from the altermagnetic material on the electron localized in a GaAs quantum dot doped on the altermagnetic material. We found a spatially inhomogeneous distribution of quantum entanglement in the postscattering state. An interesting observation is the spatially anisotropic distribution of concurrence which depends on the values of the altermagnetic spin-orbit interaction constant. We also studied R & eacute;nyi entropy and the effect of disorder in the system leading to randomness in the spin-orbit constant. Our main finding is that, due to the unique properties of an altermagnetic system, tuning the applied external magnetic field allows tailoring of the desired entangled state. Thus the scattering process, in essence, mimics the Hadamard-CNOT gate transformation, converting the initial disentangled state into the entangled state of Bell's state. In particular, we achieved more than 70% fidelity between the postscattering and Bell's states.

Distant Alice and Bob are asked to correctly mark the states of the given quantum systems via local operations and classical communication. Here we investigate the local state marking with N 4 circle times 4 systems, N = 4, 5, 6, and 7. Therein, Alice and Bob allow for three local operations: measuring the local observable either sigma( z) or sigma (x )simultaneously, and entanglement swapping. It shows that, given arbitrary four 4 circle times 4 systems, Alice and Bob can perform the perfect local quantum state marking. In the N = 5, 6 cases, they can perform perfect local state marking with specific target states. We conjecture the impossibility of the local quantum state marking given any seven target states since Alice and Bob cannot fulfill the task in the simplest case.

TI Lepton-Antineutrino Entanglement and Chiral Oscillations
SO UNIVERSE
AB Dirac bispinors belong to an irreducible representation of the complete Lorentz group, which includes parity as a symmetry yielding two intrinsic discrete degrees of freedom: chirality and spin. For massive particles, chirality is not dynamically conserved, which leads to chiral oscillations. In this contribution, we describe the effects of this intrinsic structure of Dirac bispinors on the quantum entanglement encoded in a lepton-antineutrino pair. We consider that the pair is generated through weak interactions, which are intrinsically chiral, such that in the initial state the lepton and the antineutrino have definite chirality but their spins are entangled. We show that chiral oscillations induce spin entanglement oscillations and redistribute the spin entanglement to chirality-spin correlations. Such a phenomenon is prominent if the momentum of the lepton is comparable with or smaller than its mass. We further show that a Bell-like spin observable exhibits the same behavior of the spin entanglement. Such correlations do not require the knowledge of the full density matrix. Our results show novel effects of the intrinsic bispinor structure and can be used as a basis for designing experiments to probe chiral oscillations via spin correlation measurements.

TI Statistics of projective measurement on a quantum probe as a witness of
   noncommutativity of algebra of a probed system
SO QUANTUM INFORMATION PROCESSING
AB We consider a quantum probe P undergoing pure dephasing due to its interaction with a quantum system S. The dynamics of P is then described by a well-defined sub-algebra of operators of S, i.e. the "accessible" algebra on S from the point of view of P. We consider sequences of n measurements on P, and investigate the relationship between Kolmogorov consistency of probabilities of obtaining sequences of results with various n, and commutativity of the accessible algebra. For a finite-dimensional S we find conditions under which the Kolmogorov consistency of measurement on P, given that the state of S can be arbitrarily prepared, is equivalent to the commutativity of this algebra. These allow us to describe witnesses of nonclassicality (understood here as noncommutativity) of part of S that affects the probe. For P being a qubit, the witness is particularly simple: observation of breaking of Kolmogorov consistency of sequential measurements on a qubit coupled to S means that the accessible algebra of S is noncommutative.

TI Developing single-layer metal-oxide-semiconductor quantum dots for
   diagnostic qubits
SO JOURNAL OF VACUUM SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY B
AB The design, fabrication, and characterization of single metal gate layer, metal-oxide-semiconductor (MOS) quantum dot devices robust against dielectric breakdown are presented as prototypes for future diagnostic qubits. These devices were developed as a preliminary solution to a longer term goal of a qubit platform for intercomparison between materials or for in-line diagnostics and to provide a testbed for establishing classical measurements predictive of coherence performance. For this stage, we seek a robust MOS design that is compatible with wafer and chip architectures, which has a reduced process overhead and is sufficiently capable of challenging and advancing our measurement capabilities. In this report, we present our initial batch of silicon MOS devices using a single gate layer, which have not exhibited any failures with gate voltage excursions
   > 10V but do exhibit the reduced electrostatic control expected of a single gate layer design. We observe quantum dot formation, capacitive charge sensing between channels, and reasonable effective electron temperatures that enable spin qubit studies. The costs and benefits of the trade-off between device performance and fabrication efficiency will be discussed, as well as opportunities for future improvements.

AB An important object appearing in the framework of the Tomita-Takesaki theory is an invariant cone under the modular automorphism group of von Neumann algebras. As a result of the connection between von Neumann algebras and quantum field theory, von Neumann algebras have become increasingly important for (higher) category theory and topology. We show explicitly how an example of a class of cones discovered by Connes-Araki-Haagerup (CAH), invariant under the modular automorphism group, are related to Wishart laws and information geometry. Given its relation to 2D quantum field theory this highlights new relations between (quantum) information geometry and quantum geometry. Additionally, our results have applications to qubits. The cones and the Wishart laws defined on them carry interesting monoidal structures, revealing the possibility of using a more abstract formalism of monoidal categories. Such a language is interesting as it opens a deeper possibility for generalizations of results.

TI Mie metasurfaces for enhancing photon outcoupling from single embedded
   quantum emitters
SO NANOPHOTONICS
AB Solid-state quantum emitters (QE) can produce single photons required for quantum information processing. However, their emission properties often exhibit poor directivity and polarisation definition resulting in considerable loss of generated photons. Here we propose and numerically evaluate Mie metasurface designs for outcoupling photons from an embedded and randomly-positioned QE. These Mie metasurface designs can provide over one order of magnitude enhancement in photon outcoupling with only several percent of photons being lost. Importantly, the Mie metasurfaces provide the enhancement in photon outcoupling without the need for strict QE position alignment and without affecting the intrinsic QE emission rate (Purcell enhancement). Electric dipole modes are key for achieving the enhancement and they offer a path for selective outcoupling for photons emitted with specific polarisation, including the out-of-plane polarisation. Mie metasurfaces can provide an efficient, polarisation-selective and scalable platform for QEs.

TI NON RELATIVISTIC QUANTUM FIELD THEORY: DYNAMICS AND IRREVERSIBILITY
SO ANALES AFA
AB We study aspects of quantum field theory at finite density using techniques and concepts from quantum information theory. We focus on massive Dirac fermions with chemical potential in 1 + 1 space-time dimensions. Using the entanglement entropy on an interval, we construct an entropic c-function that is finite. This c-function is not monotonous, and incorporates the long-range entanglement from the Fermi surface. Motivated by previous works on lattice models, we next compute the Renyi entropies numerically, and find Friedel-type oscillations. Next, we analyze the mutual information as a measure of correlation functions between different regions. Using a long-distance expansion developed by Cardy, we show how the mutual information detects the Fermi surface correlations already at leading order in the expansion. Finally, we analyze the relative entropy and its Renyi generalizations in order to distinguish states with different charge. We find that states in different superselection sectors give rise to a super-extensive behavior in the relative entropy.

TI PARTIAL DEGENERATION OF TENSORS
SO SIAM JOURNAL ON MATRIX ANALYSIS AND APPLICATIONS
AB Tensors are often studied by introducing preorders such as restriction and degeneration. The former describes transformations of the tensors by local linear maps on its tensor factors; the latter describes transformations where the local linear maps may vary along a curve, and the resulting tensor is expressed as a limit along this curve. In this work, we introduce and study partial degeneration, a special version of degeneration where one of the local linear maps is constant while the others vary along a curve. Motivated by algebraic complexity, quantum entanglement, and tensor networks, we present constructions based on matrix multiplication tensors and find examples by making a connection to the theory of prehomogeneous tensor spaces. We highlight the subtleties of this new notion by showing obstruction and classification results for the unit tensor. To this end, we study the notion of aided rank, a natural generalization of tensor rank. The existence of partial degenerations gives strong upper bounds on the aided rank of a tensor, which allows one to turn degenerations into restrictions. In particular, we present several examples, based on the W-tensor and the Coppersmith-Winograd tensors, where lower bounds on aided rank provide obstructions to the existence of certain partial degenerations.

TI Variational quantum generative modeling by sampling expectation values
   of tunable observables
SO NPJ QUANTUM INFORMATION
AB Expectation Value Samplers (EVSs) are quantum generative models that can learn high-dimensional continuous distributions by measuring the expectation values of parameterized quantum circuits. However, these models can demand impractical quantum resources for good performance. We investigate how observable choices affect EVS performance and propose an Observable-Tunable Expectation Value Sampler (OT-EVS), which achieves greater expressivity than standard EVS. By restricting the selectable observables, it is possible to use the classical shadows measurement scheme to reduce the sample complexity of our algorithm. In addition, we propose an adversarial training method adapted to the needs of OT-EVS. This training prioritizes classical updates of observables, minimizing the more costly updates of quantum circuit parameters. Numerical experiments, using an original simulation technique for correlated shot noise, confirm our model's expressivity and sample efficiency advantages compared to previous designs. We envision our proposal to encourage the exploration of continuous generative models running with few quantum resources.

TI Topological superfluid defects with discrete point group symmetries
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Ordinary vortex line defects are well-studied across different physical systems. Here the authors demonstrate, in atomic spinor Bose-Einstein condensates, previously unobserved vortex line defects with discrete polytope symmetries, which are of interest to quantum information applications.
   Discrete symmetries are spatially ubiquitous but are often hidden in internal states of systems where they can have especially profound consequences. In this work we create and verify exotic magnetic phases of atomic spinor Bose-Einstein condensates that, despite their continuous character and intrinsic spatial isotropy, exhibit complex discrete polytope symmetries in their topological defects. Using carefully tailored spinor rotations and microwave transitions, we engineer singular line defects whose quantization conditions, exchange statistics, and dynamics are fundamentally determined by these underlying symmetries. We show how filling the vortex line singularities with atoms in a variety of different phases leads to core structures that possess magnetic interfaces with rich combinations of discrete and continuous symmetries. Such defects, with their non-commutative properties, could provide unconventional realizations of quantum information and interferometry.

TI Entangling Quantum Generative Adversarial Networks
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB Generative adversarial networks (GANs) are one of the most widely adopted machine learning methods for data generation. In this work, we propose a new type of architecture for quantum generative adversarial networks (an entangling quantum GAN, EQ-GAN) that overcomes limitations of previously proposed quantum GANs. Leveraging the entangling power of quantum circuits, the EQ-GAN converges to the Nash equilibrium by performing entangling operations between both the generator output and true quantum data. In the first multiqubit experimental demonstration of a fully quantum GAN with a provably optimal Nash equilibrium, we use the EQ-GAN on a Google Sycamore superconducting quantum processor to mitigate uncharacterized errors, and we numerically confirm successful error mitigation with simulations up to 18 qubits. Finally, we present an application of the EQ-GAN to prepare an approximate quantum random access memory and for the training of quantum neural networks via variational datasets.

TI Circuit QED spectra in the ultrastrong coupling regime: How they differ
   from cavity QED
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Cavity quantum electrodynamics (QED) investigates the interaction between resonator-confined radiation and natural atoms. Similar phenomena can be explored using superconducting artificial atoms coupled to microwave resonators. Here, we examine incoherent and coherent spectra in a circuit QED system consisting of a flux qubit coupled to an LC resonator, considering different coupling configurations to the output transmission line. Although such systems can be effectively described by the quantum Rabi model, we demonstrate that the choice of the coupling between the resonator and the input-output channel can significantly affect the emission properties, particularly in the ultrastrong coupling regime. Specifically, we show that when the resonator is capacitively coupled with the input-output transmission line, the spectral features at zero flux offset can be mapped onto those of the cavity QED model. However, this correspondence breaks down for the mutual inductive coupling case. Extending our analysis to the parity-symmetry broken regime of the flux qubit, we further highlight how capacitive and inductive coupling mechanisms lead to distinct spectral features, emphasizing the necessity of a careful input-output treatment for an accurate description of the emission processes.

TI Cryptanalysis and improvement of quantum secure multi-party summation
   using single photons
SO PHYSICA SCRIPTA
AB A previous study [Entropy 25.4 (2023): 590] proposed a quantum secure multi-party summation protocol wherein n participants could obtain the modulo-2 summation result using single photons and single-particle operations. Owing to the absence of an entanglement state, this protocol was more practical than other quantum summation protocols that used entanglement properties. Thus, this study investigated the claim that this proposed protocol prevented the participants' secret inputs from being disclosed. It was found that the previously proposed protocol was vulnerable to a quantum Trojan horse attack owing to the circular qubit transmission mode. Using a security loophole, this study proposed an attack strategy that allowed an outside attacker to steal any participant's secret input without being detected by a third party and participants. In addition, a simulation experiment was conducted to demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed attack and evaluate the number of quantum Trojan horse probes that the attacker must inject into regular qubit sequences. Finally, a solution was proposed by modifying the protocol to securely prevent quantum Trojan horse attacks.

TI Genuine multipartite entanglement and quantum coherence in an
   electron-positron system: Relativistic covariance
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB The last two decades have witnessed an increasing effort by the scientific community toward pursuing a better framework for quantum resource covariance, with the focus predominantly posed on quantum entanglement. In this work, we move the discussion one step further by analyzing the behavior of both genuine multipartite entanglement and quantum coherence under Lorentz boosts. Specifically, we conduct a case study for the problem of an electron-positron pair created in a superposed multipartite pure state. Our approach is different from the standard treatments also in that we consider all the components of the four-momentum, thus allowing for an inspection of scenarios wherein entanglement can be encoded among these degrees of freedom as well. Our analysis reveals interesting subtleties in this problem, such as the fact that genuine 4-partite entanglement in the laboratory frame transforms into genuine 8-partite entanglement plus quantum coherence in the perspective of the Lorentz-boosted frame. Moreover, a given combination of these quantum resources is shown to form a Lorentz invariant. Although our findings are not able to determine, via first principles, an information-theoretic Lorentz invariant, they pave the way for fundamental incursions along this line.

TI On renormalization and the local gap method for proving frustration-free
   local spin chains are gapped
SO JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICAL PHYSICS
AB Key properties of a physical system depend on whether it is gapped, i.e., whether its spectral gap has a positive lower bound that is independent of system size. Here, we provide a prescription for renormalizing a spin chain Hamiltonian in such a way that the renormalized Hamiltonian is gapped if and only if the original Hamiltonian is gapped. Then, we articulate a set of conditions that guarantees the renormalized Hamiltonian is gapped. These conditions are built on a certain strong notion of decaying correlations involving an operator norm of non-commuting terms in the renormalized Hamiltonian. We apply the method to show that two interesting models, with forms motivated by quantum circuits, are gapped. We also confirm the generality of the method by successfully applying it to a somewhat different case, the well-known Affleck-Kennedy-Lieb-Tasaki (AKLT) model.

TI Simulating Chern insulators on a superconducting quantum processor
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB The quantum Hall effect, fundamental in modern condensed matter physics, continuously inspires new theories and predicts emergent phases of matter. Here we experimentally demonstrate three types of Chern insulators with synthetic dimensions on a programable 30-qubit-ladder superconducting processor. We directly measure the band structures of the 2D Chern insulator along synthetic dimensions with various configurations of Aubry-Andre-Harper chains and observe dynamical localisation of edge excitations. With these two signatures of topology, our experiments implement the bulk-edge correspondence in the synthetic 2D Chern insulator. Moreover, we simulate two different bilayer Chern insulators on the ladder-type superconducting processor. With the same and opposite periodically modulated on-site potentials for two coupled chains, we simulate topologically nontrivial edge states with zero Hall conductivity and a Chern insulator with higher Chern numbers, respectively. Our work shows the potential of using superconducting qubits for investigating different intriguing topological phases of quantum matter.
   Quantum simulations of topological matter with superconducting qubits have been attracting attention recently. Xiang et al. realize 2D and bilayer Chern insulators with synthetic dimensions on a programmable 30-qubit-ladder superconducting processor, showing bulk-boundary correspondence.

TI Theory on Electron-Phonon Spin Dephasing in GaAs Multi-Electron Double
   Quantum Dots
SO ADVANCED QUANTUM TECHNOLOGIES
AB Recent studies reveal that a double-quantum-dot system hosting more than two electrons may be superior in certain aspects as compared to the traditional case in which only two electrons are confined (a singlet-triplet qubit). The electron-phonon dephasing occurring in a GaAs multi-electron double-quantum-dot system is studied, in a biased case in which the singlet state is hybridized, as well as in an unbiased case in which the hybridization is absent. It is found that while the electron-phonon dephasing rate increases with the number of electrons confined in the unbiased case, this does not hold in the biased case. A merit figure is defined as a ratio between the exchange energy and the dephasing rate, and have shown that in experimentally relevant range of the exchange energy, the merit figure actually increases with the number of electrons in the biased case. The results show that the multi-electron quantum-dot system has another advantage in mitigating the effect of electron-phonon dephasing, which is previously under-appreciated in the literature.

TI Miniaturizing neural networks for charge state autotuning in quantum
   dots
SO MACHINE LEARNING-SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB A key challenge in scaling quantum computers is the calibration and control of multiple qubits. In solid-state quantum dots (QDs), the gate voltages required to stabilize quantized charges are unique for each individual qubit, resulting in a high-dimensional control parameter space that must be tuned automatically. Machine learning techniques are capable of processing high-dimensional data-provided that an appropriate training set is available-and have been successfully used for autotuning in the past. In this paper, we develop extremely small feed-forward neural networks that can be used to detect charge-state transitions in QD stability diagrams. We demonstrate that these neural networks can be trained on synthetic data produced by computer simulations, and robustly transferred to the task of tuning an experimental device into a desired charge state. The neural networks required for this task are sufficiently small as to enable an implementation in existing memristor crossbar arrays in the near future. This opens up the possibility of miniaturizing powerful control elements on low-power hardware, a significant step towards on-chip autotuning in future QD computers.

AB Peephole optimization of quantum circuits provides a method of leveraging standard circuit synthesis approaches into scalable quantum circuit optimization. One application of this technique partitions an entire circuit into a series of peepholes and produces multiple approximations of each partitioned subcircuit. A single approximation of each subcircuit is then selected to form optimized result circuits. We propose a series of improvements to the final phase of this architecture, which include the addition of error awareness and a better method of approximating the correctness of the result. We evaluated these proposed improvements on a set of benchmark circuits using the IBMQ FakeWashington simulator. The results demonstrate that our best-performing method provides an average reduction in Total Variational Distance (TVD) and Jensen-Shannon Divergence (JSD) of 18.2% and 15.8%, respectively, compared with the Qiskit optimizer. This also constitutes an improvement in TVD of 11.4% and JSD of 9.0% over existing solutions.

TI Unitary channel discrimination beyond group structures: Advantages of
   sequential and indefinite-causal-order strategies
SO JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICAL PHYSICS
AB For minimum-error channel discrimination tasks that involve only unitary channels, we show that sequential strategies may outperform the parallel ones. Additionally, we show that general strategies that involve indefinite causal order are also advantageous for this task. However, for the task of discriminating a uniformly distributed set of unitary channels that forms a group, we show that parallel strategies are, indeed, optimal, even when compared to general strategies. We also show that strategies based on the quantum switch cannot outperform sequential strategies in the discrimination of unitary channels. Finally, we derive an absolute upper bound for the maximal probability of successfully discriminating any set of unitary channels with any number of copies for the most general strategies that are suitable for channel discrimination. Our bound is tight since it is saturated by sets of unitary channels forming a group k-design. Published under an exclusive license by AIP Publishing.

TI Quantum convolutional neural network for phase recognition in two
   dimensions
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Quantum convolutional neural networks (QCNNs) are quantum circuits for characterizing complex quantum states. They have been proposed for recognizing quantum phases of matter at low sampling cost and have been designed for condensed matter systems in one dimension. Here we construct a QCNN that can perform phase recognition in two dimensions and correctly identify the phase transition from a toric code phase with Z2 topological order to the paramagnetic phase. The network also exhibits a noise threshold up to which the topological order is recognized. Furthermore, it captures correlations between all stabilizer elements of the toric code, which cannot be accessed by direct measurements. This increases the threshold for errors leading to such correlations and allows for correctly identifying the topological phase in the presence of strong correlated errors. Our work generalizes phase recognition with QCNNs to higher spatial dimensions and intrinsic topological order, where exploration and characterization via classical numerics become challenging.

TI Random matrix theory of the isospectral twirling
SO SCIPOST PHYSICS
AB We present a systematic construction of probes into the dynamics of isospectral ensembles of Hamiltonians by the notion of Isospectral twirling, expanding the scopes and methods of ref. [1]. The relevant ensembles of Hamiltonians are those defined by salient spectral probability distributions. The Gaussian Unitary Ensembles (GUE) describes a class of quantum chaotic Hamiltonians, while spectra corresponding to the Poisson and Gaussian Diagonal Ensemble (GDE) describe non chaotic, integrable dynamics. We compute the Isospectral twirling of several classes of important quantities in the analysis of quantum many-body systems: Frame potentials, Loschmidt Echos, OTOCs, Entanglement, Tripartite mutual information, coherence, distance to equilibrium states, work in quantum batteries and extension to CP-maps. Moreover, we perform averages in these ensembles by random matrix theory and show how these quantities clearly separate chaotic quantum dynamics from non chaotic ones.

TI Symplectic Geometry and Circuit Quantization
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB Circuit quantization is an extraordinarily successful theory that describes the behavior of quantum circuits with high precision. The most widely used approach of circuit quantization relies on introducing a classical Lagrangian whose degrees of freedom are either magnetic fluxes or electric charges in the circuit. By combining nonlinear circuit elements (such as Josephson junctions or quantum phase slips), it is possible to build circuits where a standard Lagrangian description (and thus the standard quantization method) does not exist. Inspired by the mathematics of symplectic geometry and graph theory, we address this challenge, and present a Hamiltonian formulation of nondissipative electrodynamic circuits. The resulting procedure for circuit quantization is independent of whether circuit elements are linear or nonlinear, or if the circuit is driven by external biases. We explain how to rederive known results from our formalism, and provide an efficient algorithm for quantizing circuits, including those that cannot be quantized using existing methods.

TI Loss mechanisms in TiN high impedance superconducting microwave circuits
SO APPLIED PHYSICS LETTERS
AB Aluminum-based platforms have allowed to reach major milestones for superconducting quantum circuits. For the next generation of devices, materials that are able to maintain low microwave losses while providing new functionalities, such as large kinetic inductance or compatibility with CMOS platform, are needed. Here, we report on a combined direct current and microwave investigation of titanium nitride films of different thicknesses grown using CMOS compatible methods. For microwave resonators made of 3 nm thick TiN, we measured large kinetic inductance L-K similar to 240 pH/sq, high mode impedance of similar to 4.2 k Omega while maintaining microwave quality factor similar to 10(5) in the single photon limit. We present an in-depth study of the microwave loss mechanisms in these devices that indicates the importance of quasiparticles and provide insight for further improvement.

TI Die separation for mitigation of phonon bursts in superconducting
   circuits
SO APPLIED PHYSICS LETTERS
AB Cosmic rays and background radioactive decay can deposit significant energy into superconducting quantum circuits on planar chips. This energy converts into pair-breaking phonons that travel across the substrate and generate quasiparticles, leading to correlated energy and phase errors in nearby qubits. To mitigate this, we fabricated two separate dies and placed them adjacently without a galvanic connection between them. This blocks phonon propagation from one die to the other. Using microwave kinetic inductance detectors on both dies, we detected high-energy bursts and demonstrated the blocking effect. However, we also observed simultaneous events in both dies, likely originating from a single cosmic particle traversing both dies. (C) 2025 Author(s).

TI Nonmonotonic quantum phase gathering in curved spintronic circuits
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
AB Spin carriers propagating along quantum circuits gather quantum spin phases depending on the circuit's size, shape, and spin-orbit coupling (SOC) strength. These phases typically grow monotonically with the SOC strength, as found in Rashba quantum wires and rings. In this work we show that the spin-phase gathering can be engineered by geometric means, viz., by the geometric curvature of the circuits, to be nonmonotonic. We demonstrate this peculiar property by using one-dimensional polygonal models where flat segments alternate with highly curved vertices. The complex interplay between dynamic and geometric spin-phase components- triggered by a series of emergent spin degeneracy points-leads to bounded, global spin phases. Moreover, we show that the particulars of the spin-phase gathering have observable consequences in the Aharonov-Casher conductance of Rashba loops, a connection that passed unnoticed in previous works.

TI Quantum conditional mutual information as a probe of measurement-induced
   entanglement phase transitions
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
AB We propose that the quantum conditional mutual information (QCMI), computed with a suitably chosen partition of the system, serves as a powerful probe for detecting measurement-induced entanglement phase transitions in monitored quantum circuits. To demonstrate this, we investigate monitored variable-range Clifford circuits and identify the phase boundary between volume-law and area-law entanglement phases by performing finite-size scaling analyses of the QCMI. Assuming that the entanglement entropy exhibits a logarithmic dependence on system size at criticality in short-range interacting cases, we further show that the QCMI allows for the simultaneous determination of both the critical point and the universal coefficient of the logarithmic term in the entanglement entropy via a crossing-point analysis. For the shortest-range interacting case studied, we obtain the thermodynamic-limit value of the coefficient as c = 1.519(3), which is significantly smaller than values reported in previous studies.

TI Many-Body Quantum Catalysts for Transforming Between Phases of Matter
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB A catalyst is a substance that enables otherwise impossible transformations between states of a system, without being consumed in the process. In this work, we apply the notion of catalysts to many-body quantum physics. In particular, we construct catalysts that enable transformations between different symmetry-protected topological (SPT) phases of matter using symmetric finite-depth quantum circuits. We discover a wide variety of catalysts, including GHZ-like states that spontaneously break the symmetry, gapless states with critical correlations, topological orders with symmetry fractionalization, and spin-glass states. These catalysts are all united under a single framework that has close connections to the theory of quantum anomalies, and we use this connection to put strong constraints on possible pureand mixed-state catalysts. We also show how the catalyst approach leads to new insights into the structure of certain phases of matter, and to new methods to efficiently prepare SPT phases with long-range interactions or projective measurements.

TI Strong coupling and active cooling in a finite-temperature hybrid
   atom-cavity system
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB For a standard two-level atom coupled to the quantized field of a resonant cavity, finite-temperature effects lead to thermal occupation of the cavity modes that obfuscates measurement of the quantum nature of the atom-light interaction. In this paper we demonstrate that using a hybrid system of a superconducting cavity coupled to a multilevel Rydberg atom, it is possible to observe the quantum nature of strong coupling even at finite temperatures and to exploit this coupling to permit cooling of the thermal microwave mode towards the ground state, enabling observation of coherent vacuum Rabi oscillations even at 4 K for realistic experimental parameters. Cooling for multiple atoms is also explored, showing maximal cooling for small samples, making this a viable approach to cavity cooling with potential applications in long-range coupling of superconducting qubits via thermal waveguides.

TI Finding local integrals of motion in quantum lattice models in the
   thermodynamic limit
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
AB Local integrals of motion (LIOMs) play a key role in understanding the long-time properties of closed macroscopic systems. They were found for selected integrable systems via complex analytical calculations. The existence of LIOMs and their structure can also be studied via numerical methods, which, however, involve exact diagonalization of Hamiltonians, posing a bottleneck for such studies. We show that finding LIOMs in translationally invariant lattice models or unitary quantum circuits can be reduced to a problem for which one may numerically find an exact solution in the thermodynamic limit. We develop a simple algorithm and demonstrate its efficiency by calculating LIOMs and bounds on correlations (the Mazur bounds) for infinite integrable spin chains and unitary circuits. Finally, we demonstrate that this approach identifies slow modes in nearly integrable spin models and estimates their relaxation times.

TI BCS surrogate models for floating superconductor-semiconductor hybrids
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
AB Superconductor-semiconductor hybrid devices, involving quantum dots interfaced with floating and/or grounded superconductors, have reached a level of complexity, which calls for the development of versatile and numerically efficient modeling tools. Here, we propose an extension of the surrogate model solver for subgap states [Phys. Rev. B 108, L220506 (2023)], which is able to handle floating superconducting islands with finite-charging energy. Upon eliminating all finite-size effects of the computationally demanding Richardson model approach, we achieve a more efficient way of calculating the subgap spectra and related observables without compromising their accuracy. We provide a number of benchmarks between the two approaches and showcase the versatility of the extended surrogate model solver by studying the stability of spin-triplet ground states in various tunable devices. The methods introduced here set the stage for reliable microscopic simulations of complex superconducting quantum circuits across all their relevant parameter regimes.

AB Eigenspectra that fill regions in the complex plane have been intriguing to many, inspiring research from random matrix theory to esoteric semi-infinite bounded non-Hermitian lattices. In this work, we propose a simple and robust ansatz for constructing models whose eigenspectra fill up generic prescribed regions. Our approach utilizes specially designed non-Hermitian random couplings that allow the co-existence of eigenstates with a continuum of localization lengths, mathematically emulating the effects of semi-infinite boundaries. While some of these couplings are necessarily long-ranged, they are still far more local than what is possible with known random matrix ensembles. Our ansatz can be feasibly implemented in physical platforms such as classical and quantum circuits, and harbors very high tolerance to imperfections due to its stochastic nature.

TI Sampling reduced density matrix to extract fine levels of entanglement
   spectrum and restore entanglement Hamiltonian
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB The reduced density matrix (RDM) plays a key role in quantum entanglement and measurement, as it allows the extraction of almost all physical quantities related to the reduced degrees of freedom. However, restricted by the degrees of freedom in the environment, the total system size is often limited, let alone the subsystem. To address this challenge, we propose a quantum Monte Carlo scheme with a low technical barrier, enabling precise extraction of the RDM. To demonstrate the power of the method, we present the fine levels of the entanglement spectrum (ES), which is the logarithmic eigenvalues of the RDM. We clearly show the ES for a 1D ladder with a long entangled boundary, and that for the 2D Heisenberg model with a tower of states. Furthermore, we put forward an efficient way to restore the entanglement Hamiltonian in operator-form from the sampled RDM data. Our simulation results, utilizing unprecedentedly large system sizes, establish a practical computational framework for determining entanglement quantities based on the RDM, such as the ES, particularly in scenarios where the environment has a huge number of degrees of freedom.

TI Noise-induced synchronization in coupled quantum oscillators
SO JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL PHYSICS
AB We consider the quantum dynamics of a pair of coupled quantum oscillators coupled to a common correlated dissipative environment. The resulting equations of motion for both the operator moments and covariances can be integrated analytically using the Lyapunov equations. We find that for fully correlated and fully anti-correlated environments, the oscillators relax into a phase-synchronized state that persists for long-times when the two oscillators are nearly resonant and (essentially) forever if the two oscillators are in resonance. We identify an exceptional point that indicates the onset of broken symmetry between an unsynchronized and synchronized dynamical phase of the system as correlations within the environment are increased. We also show that the environmental noise correlation leads to quantum entanglement, and all the correlations between the two oscillators are purely quantum mechanical in origin. This work provides a robust mathematical foundation for understanding how long-lived exciton coherences can be linked to vibronic correlation effects. (c) 2025 Author(s).

TI Hierarchy of quantum operations in manipulating coherence and
   entanglement
SO QUANTUM
AB Quantum resource theory under different classes of quantum operations advances multiperspective understandings of inherent quantum-mechanical properties, such as quantum coherence and quantum entanglement. We establish hierarchies of different operations for manipulating coherence and entanglement in distributed settings, where at least one of the two spatially separated parties are restricted from generating coherence. In these settings, we introduce new classes of operations and also characterize those maximal, i.e., the resource-non-generating operations, progressing beyond existing studies on incoherent versions of local operations and classical communication and those of separable operations. The maximal operations admit a semidefinite-programming formulation useful for numerical algorithms, whereas the existing operations not. To establish the hierarchies, we prove a sequence of inclusion relations among the operations by clarifying tasks where separation of the operations appears. We also demonstrate an asymptotically non-surviving separation of the operations in the hierarchy in terms of performance of the task of assisted coherence distillation, where a separation in a one-shot scenario vanishes in the asymptotic limit. Our results serve as fundamental analytical and numerical tools to investigate interplay between coherence and entanglement under different operations in the resource theory.

TI Beyond Space and Time: Quantum Superposition as a Real-Mental State
   About Choices
SO CONDENSED MATTER
AB This contribution aims to honour Guido Barbiellini's profound interest in the interpretation and impact of quantum mechanics by examining the implications of the so-called before-before Experiment on quantum entanglement. This experiment was inspired by talks and discussions with John Bell at CERN. This was during the years when John and Guido co-worked, promoting the mission of the laboratory: "to advance the boundaries of human knowledge". As the experiment uses measuring devices in motion, it can be considered a complement to entanglement experiments using stationary measuring devices, which have meanwhile been awarded the 2022 Nobel Prize in Physics. The before-before Experiment supports the idea that the quantum realm exists beyond space and time and that the quantum state is a real mental entity concerning choices. As it also leads us to a better understanding of the 'quantum collapse' and the measurement process, we pay homage to Guido's work on detectors, such as his collaborations on the DELPHI experiment at CERN, on cosmic ray detection at the International Space Station, and gamma-ray astrophysics during a large NASA space mission.

TI Creases, corners, and caustics: Properties of nonsmooth structures on
   black hole horizons
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW D
AB The event horizon of a dynamical black hole is generically a nonsmooth hypersurface. We classify the types of nonsmooth structure that can arise on a horizon that is smooth at late time. The classification includes creases, corners and caustic points. We prove that creases and corners form spacelike submanifolds of dimension 2,1 and that caustic points form a set of dimension at most 1. We classify "perestroikas" of these structures, in which they undergo a qualitative change at an instant of time. A crease perestroika gives an exact local description of the event horizon near the "instant of merger" of a generic black hole merger. Other crease perestroikas describe horizon nucleation or collapse of a hole in a toroidal horizon. Caustic perestroikas, in which a pair of caustic points either nucleate or annihilate, provide a mechanism for creases to decay. We argue that properties of quantum entanglement entropy suggest that creases might contribute to black hole entropy. We explain that a "Gauss-Bonnet" term in the entropy is nontopological on a nonsmooth horizon, which invalidates previous arguments against such a term.

TI Toward the Detection of Spin-Vortex-Induced Loop Currents in a Single
   Bilayer Bi2Sr2CaCu2O8+δ Thin
   Film and Their Possible Use as Qubits: Model Calculations for Three
   Nano-island Architecture
SO JOURNAL OF SUPERCONDUCTIVITY AND NOVEL MAGNETISM
AB A theory for cuprate superconductivity predicts the existence of nano-sized loop currents called "spin-vortex-induced loop currents (SVILCs)." In this work, we first calculate magnetic fields produced by them in a single bilayer Bi2Sr2CaCu2O8+delta (Bi-2212) thin film for the purpose of detecting the SVILCs. The estimated magnitude of the magnetic field at the point 10a (a is the lattice constant of the CuO2 plane) above the surface could be in the order of 100 mT; thus, they may be detectable by currently available detection methods. Next, we investigate the use of them as qubits (the "SVILC qubits") in an architecture composed of three nano-islands of the thin film and consider the use of the detection of the magnetic field generated by the SVILCs as the qubit readout. We show there are a number of energy levels suitable for qubit states that can be manipulated by external current feeding, and the magnetic field generated by the SVILCs is large enough to be used for the readout.

TI Quantum metrology of a structured reservoir
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Accurately characterizing the properties of structured reservoirs is a key challenge in quantum systems and is of great importance for advances in quantum metrology and sensing. In this work, we employ a two-level system (qubit) as a probe, which is coupled to a structured reservoir consisting of an ancilla qubit and a Markovian environment modeled as a thermal bath. By exploiting non-Markovian dynamics, we systematically investigate the effectiveness of different interaction types between the probe and ancilla for estimating critical parameters, including temperature, ancilla frequency, and system-bath coupling strength. We quantify the precision of parameter estimation using quantum Fisher information (QFI) and analyze the system dynamics in both transient and steady-state regimes. Our findings demonstrate that non-Markovianity substantially enhances parameter estimation in the transient regime, with specific interactions facilitating sustained information backflow and yielding higher QFI values. However, the performance of these interactions is contingent on the parameter under estimation and the operational regime. For instance, certain interactions become prominent in the transient regime but exhibit diminished utility in the steady state, whereas others maintain their effectiveness even at equilibrium. These results stress the importance of judiciously selecting interactions adapted to specific estimation objectives and operational regimes.

TI Low-Field Microwave-Free Magnetometry Using the Dipolar Spin Relaxation
   of Quartet Spin States in Silicon Carbide
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW APPLIED
AB Paramagnetic defects and nuclear spins are the major sources of magnetic-field-dependent spin relaxation in point-defect quantum bits. The detection of related optical signals has led to the development of advanced relaxometry applications with high spatial resolution. The nearly degenerate quartet ground state of the silicon-vacancy qubit in silicon carbide (SiC) is of special interest in this respect, as it gives rise to relaxation-rate extrema at vanishing magnetic field values and emits in the first near-infrared transmission window of biological tissues, providing an opportunity for the development of sensing applications for medicine and biology. However, the relaxation dynamics of the silicon-vacancy center in SiC have not yet been fully explored. In this paper, we present results from a comprehensive theoretical investigation of the dipolar spin relaxation of the quartet spin states in various local spin environments. We discuss the underlying physics and quantify the magnetic field and spin-bath-dependent relaxation time T1. Using these findings, we demonstrate that the silicon-vacancy qubit in SiC can implement microwave-free low-magnetic-field quantum sensors of great potential.

TI High-purity and stable single-photon emission in bilayer WSe2
   via phonon-assisted excitation
SO COMMUNICATIONS PHYSICS
AB The excitation scheme is essential for single-photon sources, as it governs exciton preparation, decay dynamics, and the spectral diffusion of emitted photons. While phonon-assisted excitation has shown promise in other quantum emitter platforms, its proper implementation and systematic comparison with alternative excitation schemes have not yet been demonstrated in transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD) quantum emitters. Here, we investigate the impact of various optical excitation strategies on the single-photon emission properties of bilayer WSe2 quantum emitters. Based on our theoretical predictions for the exciton preparation fidelity, we compare the excitation via the longitudinal acoustic and breathing phonon modes to conventional above-band and near-resonance excitations. Under acoustic phonon-assisted excitation, we achieve narrow single-photon emission with a reduced spectral diffusion of 0.0129 nm, a 1.8-fold improvement over above-band excitation. Additionally, excitation through breathing-phonon mode yields a high purity of 0.947 +/- 0.079 and reduces the decay time by over an order of magnitude, reaching (1.33 +/- 0.04) ns. Our comprehensive study demonstrates the crucial role of phonon-assisted excitation in optimizing the performance of WSe2-based quantum emitters, providing valuable insights for the development of single-photon sources for quantum photonics applications.

TI Grover on KATAN: Quantum Resource Estimation
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON QUANTUM ENGINEERING
AB This article presents the cost analysis of mounting Grover's key search attack on the family of KATAN block cipher. Several designs of the reversible quantum circuit of KATAN are proposed. Owing to the National Insitute of Standards and Technology's (NIST) proposal for postquantum cryptography standardization, the circuits are designed focusing on minimizing the overall depth. We observe that the reversible quantum circuits designed using and gates and T-depth one Toffoli gate give more shallow circuits. Grover oracle for KATAN is designed based on the reversible circuits, which are used further to mount Grover's key search attack on KATAN. The designs are implemented using the software framework ProjectQ, which provides a resource estimation tool to perform an appropriate cost analysis in an automated way. While estimating the resources, NIST's depth restrictions are also respected.

TI Scalable simulation of nonequilibrium quantum dynamics via classically
   optimized unitary circuits
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB The advent of near-term digital quantum computers could offer us an exciting opportunity to investigate quantum many-body phenomena beyond that of classical computing. To make the best use of the hardware available, it is paramount that we have methods that accurately simulate Hamiltonian dynamics for limited circuit depths. In this paper, we propose a method to classically optimize unitary brickwall circuits to approximate quantum time evolution operators. Our method is scalable in system size through the use of tensor networks. We demonstrate that, for various three-body Hamiltonians, our approach produces quantum circuits that can outperform trotterization in both their accuracy and the quantum circuit depth needed to implement the dynamics, with the exact details being dependent on the Hamiltonian. We also explain how to choose an optimal time step that minimizes the combined errors of the quantum device and the brickwall circuit approximation.

TI Tight Bounds on the Convergence of Noisy Random Circuits to the Uniform
   Distribution
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB We study the properties of output distributions of noisy random circuits. We obtain upper and lower bounds on the expected distance of the output distribution from the "useless" uniform distribution. These bounds are tight with respect to the dependence on circuit depth. Our proof techniques also allow us to make statements about the presence or absence of anticoncentration for both noisy and noiseless circuits. We uncover a number of interesting consequences for hardness proofs of sampling schemes that aim to show a quantum computational advantage over classical computation. Specifically, we discuss recent barrier results for depth-agnostic and/or noise-agnostic proof techniques. We show that in certain depth regimes, noise-agnostic proof techniques might still work in order to prove an often-conjectured claim in the literature on quantum computational advantage, contrary to what has been thought prior to this work.

TI Timelike entanglement entropy
SO JOURNAL OF HIGH ENERGY PHYSICS
AB We define a new complex-valued measure of information called the timelike entanglement entropy (EE) which in the boundary theory can be viewed as a Wick rotation that changes a spacelike boundary subregion to a timelike one. An explicit definition of the timelike EE in 2d field theories is provided followed by numerical computations which agree with the analytic continuation of the replica method for CFTs. We argue that timelike EE should be correctly interpreted as another measure previously considered, the pseudo entropy, which is the von Neumann entropy of a reduced transition matrix. Our results strongly imply that the imaginary part of the pseudo entropy describes an emergent time which generalizes the notion of an emergent space from quantum entanglement. For holographic systems we define the timelike EE as the total complex valued area of a particular stationary combination of both space and timelike extremal surfaces which are homologous to the boundary region. For the examples considered we find explicit matching of our optimization procedure and the careful implementation of the Wick rotation in the boundary CFT. We also make progress on higher dimensional generalizations and relations to holographic pseudo entropy in de Sitter space.

TI Quasiparticle tunneling as a probe of Josephson junction barrier and
   capacitor material in superconducting qubits
SO NPJ QUANTUM INFORMATION
AB Non-equilibrium quasiparticles are possible sources for decoherence in superconducting qubits because they can lead to energy decay or dephasing upon tunneling across Josephson junctions (JJs). Here, we investigate the impact of the intrinsic properties of two-dimensional transmon qubits on quasiparticle tunneling (QPT) and discuss how we can use quasiparticle dynamics to gain critical information about the quality of JJ barrier. We find the tunneling rate of the non-equilibrium quasiparticles to be sensitive to the choice of the shunting capacitor material and their geometry in qubits. In some devices, we observe an anomalous temperature dependence of the QPT rate below 100 mK that deviates from a constant background associated with non-equilibrium quasiparticles. We speculate that this behavior is caused by high transmission sites/defects within the oxide barriers of the JJs, leading to spatially localized subgap states. We model this by assuming that such defects generate regions with a smaller effective gap. Our results present a unique in situ characterization tool to assess the uniformity of tunnel barriers in qubit junctions and shed light on how quasiparticles can interact with various elements of the qubit circuit.

TI Entangled Unruh-DeWitt detectors amplify quantum coherence
SO EUROPEAN PHYSICAL JOURNAL C
AB We explore the quantum coherence between a pair of entangled Unruh-DeWitt detectors, interacting with a quantum field, using a nonperturbative approach in a (3+1)-dimensional Minkowski spacetime with instantaneous switching (delta\documentclass[12pt]{minimal} \usepackage{amsmath} \usepackage{wasysym} \usepackage{amsfonts} \usepackage{amssymb} \usepackage{amsbsy} \usepackage{mathrsfs} \usepackage{upgreek} \setlength{\oddsidemargin}{-69pt} \begin{document}$$\delta $$\end{document}-switching). It is intriguing to observe that for a maximally entangled state, increasing the coupling strength enhances the detectors' initial quantum coherence while simultaneously causing a monotonic decrease in their initial entanglement. This reveals a remarkable phenomenon: through nonperturbative interactions, entangled Unruh-DeWitt detectors can exhibit a dual effect-amplifying quantum coherence while degrading quantum entanglement. This finding stands in stark contrast to previous studies based on perturbative methods or Gaussian switching functions, which generally concluded that interactions between detectors and the field lead to a simultaneous degradation of quantum coherence and entanglement due to environmental decoherence. Notably, while initially separable detectors successfully harvest quantum coherence from the vacuum, entanglement extraction remains fundamentally prohibited. These contrasting behaviors underscore the fundamental distinction between coherence and entanglement as quantum resources, and highlight their complementary roles in field-detector interactions.

TI Entanglement as a Method to Reduce Uncertainty
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF THEORETICAL PHYSICS
AB In physics, entanglement 'reduces' the entropy of an entity, because the (von Neumann) entropy of, e.g., a composite bipartite entity in a pure entangled state is systematically lower than the entropy of the component sub-entities. We show here that this 'genuinely non-classical reduction of entropy as a result of composition' also holds whenever two concepts combine in human cognition and, more generally, it is valid in human culture. On the basis of these results, we make a 'new hypothesis' on the nature of entanglement, namely, the production of entanglement in the preparation of a composite entity can be seen as a 'dynamical process of collaboration between its sub-entities to reduce uncertainty', because the composite entity is in a pure state while its sub-entities are in a non-pure state as a result of the preparation. We identify within the nature of this entanglement a mechanism of contextual updating and illustrate the mechanism in the examples we analyse. Our hypothesis naturally explains the non-classical nature of some quantum logical connectives, as due to Bell-type correlations.

TI Formation of Fano resonance in double quantum dot system
SO JOURNAL OF MAGNETISM AND MAGNETIC MATERIALS
AB Transient electron dynamics and the Fano resonance formation over time in transport through a two quantum dot system in a T-shape geometry (2QD-T) are analyzed for free electrons. Time evolution of the transport characteristics are different for a weak and a strong inter-dot coupling with respect to the dot-electrode coupling. When the dot-dot coupling is weak, we find that transport dynamics is governed by two channel tunneling processes with two different relaxation times and buildup of the Fano resonance is developed much slower, with the longer relaxation time. In the opposite limit, the transmission evolves with a single relaxation time, from the single peak resonance structure into the structure with two asymmetric peaks. One observes large dot-electrode charge oscillations, which can temporarily change direction of transient currents. We find also that the time evolution of entanglement is different in both coupling regimes; in particular rapid Rabi oscillations caused by coherent electron transfer between the 2QD states can be seen for the strong dot-dot coupling.

TI Noise Cancellation Effects in Integrated Photonics with Wilkinson Power
   Dividers
SO ACS PHOTONICS
AB Wilkinson power dividers (WPDs) are a popula r element in RF and microwave technologies known for providing isolation capabilities. Howe v e r , the benefits that WPDs could offer to integrated photonic systems are far less studied . Here, we investigate the thermal emission from and the noise performance of silicon-on-insulator (SOI) WPDs. We find that WPDs exhibit a noiseless port, with important implications for receiving systems and absorption-based quantum state transformations. At the same time, the thermal signals exiting noisy ports exhibit nontrivial correlations, opening the possibility for noise cancellation. We analyze passive and active networks containing WPDs showing how such nontrivial correlations can prevent the amplification of the thermal noise introduced by WPDs while benefiting from their isolation capabilities. Using this insight, we propose a modified ring-resonator amplifier that improves by N times the SNR in comparison with conventional traveling wave and ring-resonator amplifiers, with N being the number of inputs/outputs of the WPD. We believe that our results represent an important step forward in the implementation of SOI-WPDs and thei r integration in complex photonic networks, particularly for mid-IR and quantum photonics applications.

TI Silicon Nitride Microresonator Raman Lasers
SO LASER & PHOTONICS REVIEWS
AB Silicon nitride (SiN) has emerged as a promising platform for integrated nonlinear photonics because of its low propagation loss, wide transparency window, and CMOS compatibility. Nonlinear processes arising from photon-electron interactions, such as Kerr frequency comb generation and second harmonic generation, have been extensively explored. In contrast, photon-phonon interaction-based nonlinearities, such as stimulated Raman scattering, remain largely unexplored in this integrated platform, despite their potential for broadband frequency conversion. Here, we demonstrate efficient Raman lasing in ultra-high- SiN microresonators by harnessing the strong intracavity field enhancement and engineering the optical mode to overlap with the Raman-active silica cladding. Through dispersion engineering and waveguide geometry optimization, we suppress competing Kerr nonlinearities while enhancing Raman gain, achieving lasing with sub-2 thresholds. We further investigate the trade-off between optical confinement and quality factor, revealing its impact on the overall nonlinear efficiency. Moreover, we also demonstrate broadband tunability of the Raman shift exceeding 120 , enabled by the wide Raman gain spectrum of silica, offering new flexibility in designing integrated tunable Raman lasers. These results position SiN as a viable platform for chip-scale Raman lasers, expanding the nonlinear optics toolbox of the SiN platform and enabling compact, power-efficient light sources for applications in spectroscopy, optical communications, and quantum photonics.

TI Avoiding lateral mode leakage in thin film lithium niobate waveguides
   for the generation of spectrally pure photons at telecom wavelengths
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICS B-ATOMIC MOLECULAR AND OPTICAL PHYSICS
AB Photonic integrated optical components, notably straight waveguides, serve as pivotal elements for on-chip generation and manipulation of quantum states of light. In this work, we focus on optimizing waveguides based on lithium niobate on insulator (LNOI) to generate photon pairs at telecom wavelengths using spontaneous parametric down-conversion (SPDC). Specifically, we investigate lateral leakage for all possible SPDC processes involving type 0, type I, and type II phase matching conditions in an X-cut lithium niobate waveguide and provide a recipe to avoid leakage loss for the interacting photons. Furthermore, focusing on type II phase matching, we engineer the waveguide in the single-mode regime such that it also satisfies group index matching for generating spectrally pure single photons with high purity (99.33%). We also address fabrication imperfections of the optimized design and find that the spectral purity of the generated photons is robust to fabrication errors. This work offers guidance for the suitable selection of morphological parameters to obtain lossless, single-mode LNOI waveguides for building linear optical circuits and photon pair generation at telecom wavelengths using desired phase-matching conditions.

TI Structural Dynamics and Electronic Properties of Semiconductor Quantum
   Dots: Computational Insights
SO CHEMISTRY OF MATERIALS
AB Semiconductor quantum dots (QDs) exhibit exciting photophysical properties for a wide variety of applications in the field of energy conversion, lighting, and more recently quantum communication. The photophysics underpinning these applications at ambient conditions strongly depends on atomistic details of their dynamic surface. Neutral organic ligands used in surface passivation play a critical role in determining the structural and optoelectronic properties of these QDs. Small sizes and irregular atomic arrangements make these QD surface-ligand interfaces challenging to explore at the atomistic level. Here, we combine several computational simulation techniques to study thermally induced geometrical fluctuations in stable cadmium selenide (CdSe) QDs with and without ligand passivation. We find that structural fluctuations of surface atoms significantly depend on passivating molecules. The bulky and strongly binding ligands such as phosphine oxides induce a higher extent of interfacial dynamics. Though these stoichiometric QDs do not possess any permanent in-gap states, significant thermal distortion of QD-ligand interfaces can induce fluctuating defectlike states near band edges. Such vibronic dynamics in these QDs also modifies band-edge state positions on sub-picosecond timescale, impacting their functional properties. Our results further suggest that primary amine ligands are optimal choices for QD passivation. These insights may be helpful to make design principles for screening and optimizing passivating ligands best suited for various QD applications, such as for quantum communication technologies.

TI From SU(2) holonomies to holographic duality via tensor networks
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW D
AB Tensor networks provide a powerful tool for studying many-body quantum systems, particularly making quantum simulations more efficient. In this article, we construct a tensor network representation of the spin network states, which correspond to SU(2) gauge-invariant discrete field theories. Importantly, the spin network states play a central role in the loop quantum gravity (LQG) approach to the Planck scale physics. Our focus is on the Ising-type spin networks, which provide a basic model of quantum space in LQG. It is shown that the tensor network approach improves the previously introduced methods of constructing quantum circuits for the Ising spin networks by reducing the number of qubits involved. It is also shown that the tensor network approach is convenient for implementing holographic states involving the bulkboundary conjecture, which contributes to establishing a link between LQG and holographic duality.

TI Improvement of emission intensity of PbS quantum dots in thick silica

SO JAPANESE JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYSICS
AB Positioning of colloidal quantum dots (QDs) by nanoholes is applicable to fabricating quantum devices such as quantum circuits. A silica coating technique that facilitates the positioning manages the effective size of QDs while preserving the quantum state inside. In the reverse micelle method, which is commonly used for the silica coating, optical properties deteriorate due to the exposure of QD surface to moisture within the reverse micelle. We studied a thin silica coating on the surface of PbS QDs by pyrolyzing tetraethyl orthosilicate in an organic solvent before forming a thick silica shell by the reverse micelle method. As a result, highly luminous silica-coated PbS QDs with a diameter of about 110 nm were realized. (c) 2023 The Japan Society of Applied Physics

TI Memory in quantum processes with indefinite time direction and causal
   order
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB We examine the emergence of dynamical memory effects in quantum processes having indefinite time direction and causal order. In particular, we focus on the class of phase-covariant qubit channels, which encompasses some of the most significant paradigmatic open quantum system models. In order to assess the memory in the time evolution of the system, we utilize the trace distance and the entanglement based measures of non-Markovianity. While the indefinite time direction is obtained through the quantum time flip operation that realizes a coherent superposition of forward and backward processes, the indefinite causal order is achieved via the quantum switch map, which implements two quantum processes in a coherent superposition of their two possible orders. Considering various different families of phase-covariant qubit channels, we demonstrate that, when implemented on memoryless quantum processes, both the quantum time flip and the quantum switch operations can generate memory effects in the dynamics according to the trace distance based measure under certain conditions. On the other hand, with respect to the entanglement based measure, we show that neither the quantum time flip nor the quantum switch could induce dynamical memory for any of the considered phase-covariant channels.

TI Ultra-high-Q photonic crystal nanobeam cavity for etchless lithium
   niobate on insulator (LNOI) platform
SO OPTO-ELECTRONIC ADVANCES
AB The expansive spectral coverage and superior optical properties of lithium niobate (LN) offer a comprehensive suite of tools for exploring novel functionalities. Achieving high-quality (Q) photonic resonator cavities is crucial for enhancing light-matter interactions. However, this task is challenging as the device performance is heavily dependent on the fabrication quality of the LN. In this paper, we present experimental validation of an etchless approach to fabricating high-Q photonic crystal nanobeam cavities (PCNBCs). We successfully fabricate PCNBCs with Q factors exceeding 105 while maintaining high transmittance by capitalizing on the low waveguide loss and high fabrication tolerance of TE-polarized mode. Remarkably, the Q factor achieved here exceeds previous reports on etchless LN PCNBCs by over an order of magnitude. Benefiting from this advancement, we further explore a variety of optical functions, including thermo-optic tuning, optically induced bistability, and Fano line shapes generation. These findings present promising prospects for a versatile platform technique, facilitating the development of high-performance electro-optic or acousto-optic modulators, optical logic devices, and quantum photonics, highlighting its significant impact in the field of photonic integration.

SO NANOPHOTONICS
AB Nonlinear optics, the study of intense light-matter interactions, traditionally uses bulk materials like LiNbO3 for device fabrication. However, these materials face challenges such as limited nonlinear susceptibility, large dimensions, and phase matching issues, limiting compact and integrated devices. Recent research has illuminated that a variety of low-dimensional materials exhibit markedly stronger nonlinear optical responses than their bulk counterparts. This has made nonlinear optics in low-dimensional materials a dynamic area of study, allowing for rapid light-matter interactions and advancing nonlinear nanophotonic and optoelectronic applications. These applications span diverse areas, from wavelength conversion and the generation of ultrashort laser pulses to advancements in quantum photonics and integrated photonic technologies. This review covers two-dimensional materials such as graphene and transition metal dichalcogenides to one-dimensional forms like carbon nanotubes and nanowires, and further to zero-dimensional structures including nanoparticles and quantum dots. By providing a comprehensive overview of the current state of non-linear optics in the context of low-dimensional materials, this review not only encapsulates the existing knowledge base but also charts a course for future explorations in this rapidly progressing domain.

TI A Concrete LIP-Based KEM With Simple Lattices
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB Recent developments have been made in the construction of cryptosystems with security based on the hardness of the lattice isomorphism problem (LIP). Due to lattice conjectures, one may expect in the future that breaking such schemes is computationally harder than most current lattice-based cryptosystems. To the best of our knowledge, there have not been any attempts to concretely instantiate a key encapsulation mechanism (KEM) based on LIP. In this work, we propose the first instance of such a KEM, following the framework of Ducas and van Woerden (EUROCRYPT 2022), using simple lattices. We present a randomness extractor derived from a hash function based on the short integer solution problem; define a concrete set of parameters for instantiating the scheme; provide a rigorous security estimation of an attacker trying to decode an encapsulated key through reductions to hard lattice problems; and use well-known methods to convert the IND-CPA secure KEM into an IND-CCA2 secure KEM, comparing the latter with other modern lattice-based KEMs. The resulting security is estimated under the assumption that an adversary cannot efficiently solve related instances of LIP, which is a consequence of the lack of cryptanalysis towards identifying isomorphism between lattices.

TI Efficient multiparty quantum secret sharing based on a novel structure
   and single qubits
SO EPJ QUANTUM TECHNOLOGY
AB Quantum secret sharing (QSS) is a significant branch of quantum cryptography and can be widely used in various applications. Quantum secret sharing schemes can be developed by utilizing different features of quantum mechanics, and quantum secure direct communication (QSDC) is an effective way to achieve secret sharing using single qubits. The utilization of QSDC offers certain benefits, such as low cost, high security, and great potential for implementation with current technologies. However, the purpose of QSDC is different from that of QSS, which causes some vulnerabilities, such as dishonest participant attacks. We discover two critical factors that affect the security of traditional protocols. Firstly, they skip a few steps from the QSDC protocol to the QSS protocol. Secondly, the participants have different privileges. This can lead to participants with more privileges engaging in potential attack behavior. In light of these issues, this study proposes a new multiparty QSS scheme to address these vulnerabilities. The proposed protocol ensures the independence of each participant and grants them equal privileges. Analysis results demonstrate that it can defend against malicious attackers, retain the advantages of the QSDC protocol, and further reduce transmission costs. It achieves an excellent balance between security and performance.

TI Optimal High-Dimensional Entanglement Concentration for Pure Bipartite
   Systems
SO MICROMACHINES
AB Considering pure quantum states, entanglement concentration is the procedure where, from N copies of a partially entangled state, a single state with higher entanglement can be obtained. Obtaining a maximally entangled state is possible for N=1. However, the associated success probability can be extremely low when increasing the system's dimensionality. In this work, we study two methods to achieve a probabilistic entanglement concentration for bipartite quantum systems with a large dimensionality for N=1, regarding a reasonably good probability of success at the expense of having a non-maximal entanglement. Firstly, we define an efficiency function Q considering a tradeoff between the amount of entanglement (quantified by the I-Concurrence) of the final state after the concentration procedure and its success probability, which leads to solving a quadratic optimization problem. We found an analytical solution, ensuring that an optimal scheme for entanglement concentration can always be found in terms of Q. Finally, a second method was explored, which is based on fixing the success probability and searching for the maximum amount of entanglement attainable. Both ways resemble the Procrustean method applied to a subset of the most significant Schmidt coefficients but obtaining non-maximally entangled states.

SO NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB Device-independent (DI) certification schemes are based on minimal assumptions about the quantum system under study, which makes the most desirable among certification schemes. However, they are often the most challenging to implement. In order to reduce the implementation cost one can consider semi-DI (SDI) schemes such as those based on quantum steering. Here we provide a construction of a family of steering inequalities which are tailored to large classes of d-outcomes projective measurements being a certain linear combination of the Heisenberg-Weyl operators on the untrusted side and a fixed set of known measurements on the trusted side. We then prove that the maximal quantum violation of those inequalities can be used for certification of those measurements and the maximally entangled state of two qudits. Importantly, in our self-testing proof, we do not assume the shared state to be pure, nor do we assume the measurements to be projective. Before concluding, we also show how robust to noise our self-testing statement is. We believe that our construction broadens the scope of SDI certification, paving the way for more general but still less costly quantum certification protocols.

TI Classifying One-Dimensional Quantum States Prepared by a Single Round of
   Measurements
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB Measurements and feedback have emerged as powerful resources for creating many-body quantum states. However, a detailed understanding has been restricted to fixed-point representatives of phases of matter. Here, we go beyond this and characterize the patterns of many-body entanglement that can be deterministically created from measurement. Focusing on one spatial dimension, a framework is developed for the case where a single round of measurements is the only entangling operation. We show this creates matrix-product states and identify necessary and sufficient tensor conditions for preparability, which uniquely determine the preparation protocol. We use these conditions to both classify preparable quantum states and characterize their physical constraints. In particular, we find a trade-off between the richness of the preparable entanglement spectrum and correlation functions, which leads to a no-go theorem for preparing certain quantum states. More broadly, we connect properties of the preparation protocol to the resulting phase of matter, including trivial, symmetry-breaking, and symmetry-protected topological phases-for both uniform and modulated symmetries. This work offers a resource-theoretic perspective on preparable quantum entanglement and shows how to systematically create states of matter, away from their fixed points, in quantum devices.

TI Systematic HLS Co-Design: Achieving Scalable and Fully-Pipelined NTT
   Acceleration on FPGAs
SO ELECTRONICS
AB Lattice-based cryptography (LBC) is an essential direction in the fields of homomorphic encryption (HE), zero-knowledge proofs (ZK), and post-quantum cryptography (PQC), while number theoretic transformations (NTT) are a performance bottleneck that affects the promotion and deployment of LBC applications. Field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) are an ideal platform for accelerating NTT due to their reconfigurability and parallel capabilities. High-level synthesis (HLS) can shorten the FPGA development cycle, but for algorithms such as NTT, the synthesizer struggles to handle the inherent memory dependencies, often resulting in suboptimal synthesis outcomes for direct designs. This paper proposes a systematic HLS co-design to progressively guide the synthesis of NTT accelerators. The approach integrates several key techniques: arithmetic module resource optimization, conflict-free butterfly scheduling, memory partitioning, and template-based automated design fusion. It reveals how to resolve pipeline bottlenecks in HLS-based designs and expand parallel processing, guiding microarchitecture iterations to achieve an efficient design space. Compared to existing HLS-based designs, the area-latency product achieves a performance improvement of 1.93 to 191 times, and compared to existing HDL-based designs, the area-cycle product achieves a performance improvement of 1.7 to 10.6 times.

TI Efficient error-correcting codes for the HQC post-quantum cryptosystem
SO DESIGNS CODES AND CRYPTOGRAPHY
AB The HQC post-quantum cryptosystem enables two parties to share noisy versions of a common secret binary string, and an error-correcting code is required to deal with the mismatch between both versions. This code is required to deal with binary symmetric channels with as large a transition parameter as possible, while guaranteeing, for cryptographic reasons, a decoding error probability of provably not more than 2-128. This requirement is non-standard for digital communications, and modern coding techniques are not amenable to this setting. This paper explains how this issue is addressed in the last version of HQC: precisely, we introduce a coding scheme that consists of concatenating a Reed-Solomon code with the tensor product of a Reed-Muller code and a repetition code. We analyze its behavior in detail and show that it significantly improves upon the previous proposition for HQC, which consisted of tensoring a BCH and a repetition code. As additional results, we also provide a better approximation of the weight distribution for HQC error vectors, and we remark that the size of the exchanged secret in HQC can be reduced to match the protocol security which also significantly improves performance.

AB In 2020, Kudinov, Kiktenko, and Fedorov pointed out a flaw in the tight security proof of the SPHINCS+ construction. This work gives a new tight security proof for SPHINCS+. The flaw can be traced back to the security proof for the Winternitz one-time signature scheme (WOTS) used within SPHINCS+. In this work, we give a stand-alone description of the WOTS variant used in SPHINCS+ that we call WOTS-TW. We provide a security proof for WOTS-TW and multi-instance WOTS-TW against non-adaptive chosen message attacks where the adversary only learns the public key after it made its signature query. Afterwards, we show that this is sufficient to give a tight security proof for SPHINCS+. We recover almost the same bound for the security of SPHINCS+, with only a factor w loss compared to the previously claimed bound, where w is the Winternitz parameter that is commonly set to 16. On a more technical level, we introduce new lower bounds on the quantum query complexity for generic attacks against properties of cryptographic hash functions and analyse the constructions of tweakable hash functions used in SPHINCS+ with regard to further security properties.

CL ELECTR NETWORK
AB Multivariate public key cryptosystem (MPKC) is one of the promising candidates for post-quantum cryptography (PQC) as it features fast and efficient computation with security under the NP hardness of solving a system of multivariate quadratic (MQ) polynomial equations over a finite field. In the last two decades, there have been remarkable development in MPKC specially in signature and encryption scheme. In this work, we have developed a multivariate identity-based signature (MV-IBS) scheme employing a specialized version of non-interactive zero-knowledge proofs of knowledge (NIZK). Our construction is existentially unforgeable against chosen message and chosen identity attack (EUF-CMA) in the random oracle model (ROM) under the hardness of the isomorphism of polynomials (IP) problem. An IP problem tests the equivalence of two polynomial maps. It says that given access to two quadratic functions which are equal up to linear changes of coordinates, it is difficult to compute these changes of coordinates. We emphasize that unlike most of the MPKC, our scheme achieves provable security in an existing security framework. Additionally, the proposed IBS performs better over the existing works in terms of user's secret key size, master public key size and master secret key size.

TI High-speed electro-optic modulation in topological interface states of a
   one-dimensional lattice
SO LIGHT-SCIENCE & APPLICATIONS
AB Electro-optic modulators are key components in data communication, microwave photonics, and quantum photonics. Modulation bandwidth, energy efficiency, and device dimension are crucial metrics of modulators. Here, we provide an important direction for the miniaturization of electro-optic modulators by reporting on ultracompact topological modulators. A topological interface state in a one-dimensional lattice is implemented on a thin-film lithium-niobate integrated platform. Due to the strong optical confinement of the interface state and the peaking enhancement of the electro-optic response, a topological cavity with a size of 1.6 x 140 mu m2 enables a large modulation bandwidth of 104 GHz. The first topological modulator exhibits the most compact device size compared to reported LN modulators with bandwidths above 28 GHz, to the best of our knowledge. 100 Gb/s non-return-to-zero and 100 Gb/s four-level pulse amplitude modulation signals are generated. The switching energy is 5.4 fJ/bit, owing to the small electro-optic mode volume and low capacitance. The topological modulator accelerates the response time of topological photonic devices from the microsecond order to the picosecond order and provides an essential foundation for the implementation of large-scale lithium-niobate photonic integrated circuits.

TI Simulating the photon statistics of multimode Gaussian states by
   automatic differentiation of generating functions
SO APL PHOTONICS
AB Advances in photonics require photon-number resolved simulations of quantum optical experiments with Gaussian states. We demonstrate a simple and versatile method to simulate the photon statistics of general multimode Gaussian states. The derived generating functions enable simulations of the photon number distribution, cumulative probabilities, moments, and factorial moments of the photon statistics of Gaussian states as well as of multimode photon-added and photon-subtracted Gaussian states. Numerical results are obtained by the automatic differentiation of these generating functions by employing the software framework PyTorch. Our approach is particularly well suited for practical simulations of the photon statistics of quantum optical experiments in realistic scenarios with low photon numbers, in which various sources of imperfections have to be taken into account. As an example, we calculate the detection probabilities for a recent multipartite time-bin coding quantum key distribution setup and compare them with the corresponding experimental values.(c) 2023 Author(s).

TI Multichannel joint-polarization-frequency-modulation encrypted
   metasurface in secure THz communication
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB Since the discovery of wireless telegraphy, wireless communication via electromagnetic (EM) signals has become a standard solution to meet the growing demand for information transfer in modern society. To prevent counterfeiting and manipulation by unauthorized individuals, it is crucial to innovate and enhance security through information encryption. In this paper, we introduce a metasurface that controls the amplitude modulation at two different frequencies. Here, focusing on amplitude-frequency modulation for both x-and y-polarizations, we present an encrypted wireless communication protocol that uses the chaos algorithm to secure the target data and prevent eavesdroppers from accessing it. The encrypted data is transmitted through varying amplitudes at two different frequencies for both linear polarizations, achieved using two distinct graphene layers individually controlled by external biasing conditions. The extensive freedom enabled by simultaneous modulation of amplitude, frequency, and polarization allows information to be transmitted across many channels, thereby enhancing the security of encrypted information. The simulations demonstrate that encoding data, such as images, and transmitting it through amplitude-frequency modulation for both horizontal and vertical polarizations offers promising opportunities for various applications, including terahertz (THz) communications, anti-counterfeiting, THz data storage, and THz data transmission.

TI Performance and Efficiency Evaluation of M-SIDH
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB As the recent Castryck-Decru attack recovers the private key of SIDH in polynomial time, various methods have been proposed to prevent the attack. Among these, M-SIDH, proposed by Fouotsa et al., counters the Castryck-Decru attack by masking the torsion-point information transmitted during the key exchange process. In this paper, we implement M-SIDH and examine its performance. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first C language implementation of M-SIDH. In this regard, we propose a method for selecting parameters for M-SIDH and introduce a 2048-bit and a 4096-bit prime for the implementation, targeting the 64-bit and 116-bit classical security levels, respectively. We also optimize the square-root Velu formula in the context of SIDH. The original square-root Velu formula has been used in CSIDH-based systems, where an evaluation of a single point only needs to be performed. In this paper, we suggest an optimal method to use the square-root Velu formula in the SIDH environment, which requires multiple isogeny evaluations. Our implementation results show that MSIDH-2048 and MSIDH-4096 take 16.20s and 190.45s, respectively.

TI Fermionic partial transpose in the overlap matrix framework for
   entanglement negativity
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
AB Over the past two decades, the overlap matrix approach has been developed to compute quantum entanglement in free-fermion systems, particularly to calculate entanglement entropy and entanglement negativity. This method involves the use of partial trace and partial transpose operations within the overlap matrix framework. However, in previous studies, only the conventional partial transpose in fermionic systems has been considered, which does not account for fermionic anticommutation relations. Although the concept of a fermionic partial transpose was introduced by Shapourian et al. [Phys. Rev. B 95, 165101 (2017)], it has not yet been systematically incorporated into the overlap matrix framework. In this paper, we introduce the fermionic partial transpose into the overlap matrix approach, provide a systematic analysis of the validity of partial trace and partial transpose operations, and derive an explicit formula for calculating entanglement negativity in bipartite systems. Additionally, we numerically compute the logarithmic negativity of two lattice models to verify the Gioev-Klich-Widom scaling law. For tripartite geometries, we uncover limitations of the overlap matrix method and demonstrate that the previously reported logarithmic negativity result for a homogeneous one-dimensional chain in a disjoint interval geometry exceeds its theoretical upper bound.

TI Optical vortices by an adaptive spiral phase plate
SO OPTICS AND LASER TECHNOLOGY
AB An Adaptive Spiral Phase Plate (ASPP) based on liquid crystal (LC) and the transmission electrode technique is theoretically and experimentally demonstrated. This ASPP design enables the generation of high-quality optical vortices with topological charges ranging from +/- 1 to +/- 4 using a single device, with higher charges being directly achievable by employing higher-birefringence LC or thicker cells. The continuous reconfigurability of the optical phase shift, achieved through a simple control mechanism involving only two low voltages and 100 electrodes that distribute the voltage, sets this device as an accurate approximation to a continuous ASPP. The measured conversion efficiency ranges between almost 100% and 95% for the first and fourth topological charges, respectively. This device offers remarkable advantages, such as complete reconfigurability, allowing adjustment of operating wavelengths and topological charges. The fabrication process mirrors that of a standard LCD cell, ensuring a cost-effective and reliable solution. In summary, the proposed ASPP is a key advancement, providing superior light conversion efficiency, simplicity, and the capability for on-the-fly reconfiguration in various optical applications.

TI Trimer quantum spin liquid in a honeycomb array of Rydberg atoms
SO COMMUNICATIONS PHYSICS
AB Quantum spin liquids are elusive but paradigmatic examples of strongly correlated quantum states that are characterized by long-range quantum entanglement. Recently, signatures of a gapped topological Z(2) spin liquid have been observed in a system of Rydberg atoms; however, the full capability of these platforms to realize quantum spin liquids extends far beyond this state alone. Here, we propose the realization of a different class of spin liquids in a honeycomb array of Rydberg atoms. Exploring the system's quantum phase diagram using density-matrix renormalization group and exact diagonalization calculations, we identify several density-wave-ordered phases and a trimer spin liquid ground state with an emergent U(1) x U(1) local symmetry. This liquid state originates from superpositions of classical trimer configurations on the dual triangular lattice in the regime where third-nearest-neighbor atoms lie within the Rydberg blockade radius. Finally, we discuss the conditions to enhance the preparation fidelity of this state by a general Rydberg-blockade-based projection mechanism, test the robustness of the trimer spin liquid phase in a range of realistic parameters, and outline methods for its experimental detection.

TI Towards retrieving dispersion profiles using quantum-mimic optical
   coherence tomography and machine learning
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB Artefacts in quantum-mimic optical coherence tomography are considered detrimental because they scramble the images even for the simplest objects. They are a side effect of autocorrelation, which is used in the quantum entanglement mimicking algorithm behind this method. Interestingly, the autocorrelation imprints certain characteristics onto an artefact - it makes its shape and characteristics depend on the amount of dispersion exhibited by the layer that artefact corresponds to. In our method, a neural network learns the unique relationship between the artefacts' shape and GVD, and consequently, it is able to provide a good qualitative representation of object's dispersion profile for never-seen-before data: computer-generated single dispersive layers and experimental pieces of glass. We show that the autocorrelation peaks - additional peaks in the A-scan appearing due to the interference of light reflected from the object - affect the GVD profiles. Through relevant calculations, simulations and experimental testing, the mechanism leading to the observed GVD changes is identified and explained. Finally, the network performance is tested in the presence of noise in the data and with the experimental data representing single layers of quartz, sapphire and BK7.

TI Improving entanglement of even entangled coherent states via
   superposition of number-conserving operations
SO RESULTS IN PHYSICS
AB A scheme for improving entanglement is proposed by repeatedly performing number-conserving generalized superposition of products (GSP) operation, i.e., (saa dagger + ta dagger a)(m) with s(2) + t(2) = 1, on each modes of even entangled coherent state (EECS). Both Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR) correlation and concurrence are used as the measures for describing entanglement. It is found that both single-mode and two-mode-symmetric GSP operations can be used for the entanglement improvement. In particular, for the optimal EPR correlation, the GSP-EECS with two-mode-symmetric first-order operations presents a better performance for the entanglement improvement than the cases of high-order GSP operations. Compared to several special non-Gaussian operations, including photon subtraction-then-addition (PSTA) (s = 0) and photon-addition-then-subtraction (PATS) (s = 1), it is shown that the entanglement of GSP-EECS is always superior to those of both PSTA-EECS and PATS-EECS at a small amplitude level. When the GSP-EECS is used as the entangled resource for teleportation, our optimal teleportation fidelity presents the best performance.

TI Recombination of localized quasiparticles in disordered superconductors
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Disordered superconductors offer new impedance regimes for quantum circuits, enable a pathway to protected qubits, and can improve superconducting detectors due to their high kinetic inductance and sheet resistance. The performance of these devices can be limited, however, by quasiparticles-the fundamental excitations of a superconductor. While experiments have shown that disorder affects the relaxation of quasiparticles drastically, the microscopic mechanisms are still not understood. We address this issue by measuring quasiparticle relaxation in a disordered beta-Ta film, which we pattern as the inductor of a microwave resonator. We observe that quasiparticle recombination is governed by the phonon scattering time, which is faster than conventional recombination in ordered superconductors. We interpret the results as recombination of localized quasiparticles, induced by disorder, which first delocalize via phonon absorption. We analyze quasiparticle relaxation measurements on superconductors with different degrees of disorder and conclude that this phenomenon is inherent to disordered superconductors.

TI A cryo-CMOS chip that integrates silicon quantum dots and multiplexed
   dispersive readout electronics
SO NATURE ELECTRONICS
AB An integrated circuit fabricated using industry-standard 40 nm complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor technology can combine silicon quantum devices, digital addressing and analogue multiplexed dispersive readout electronics.
   As quantum computers grow in complexity, the technology will have to evolve from large distributed systems to compact integrated solutions. Spin qubits in silicon quantum dots are thought to offer good scalability because both spin-carrying quantum dots and support complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) electronics can, in principle, be monolithically integrated on a single chip. However, monolithically integrated quantum-classical hybrid circuits based on industry-standard CMOS technology remain limited. Here we report a millikelvin integrated circuit fabricated using 40 nm CMOS technology that integrates silicon quantum-dot arrays with support electronics in an architecture that allows the array to be efficiently addressed and read. The architecture contains integrated microwave lumped-element resonators for dispersive sensing of the charge state of the quantum dots, mediated via digital transistors in a column-row-addressing distribution. With the chip, we demonstrate combined time- and frequency-division multiplexing, which scales sublinearly the resources as well as footprint required for readout.

TI Universal performance gap of neural quantum states applied to the
   Hofstadter-Bose-Hubbard model
SO SCIPOST PHYSICS
AB Neural Quantum States (NQS) have demonstrated significant potential in approximating ground states of many-body quantum systems, though their performance can be inconsistent across different models. This study investigates the performance of NQS in approximating the ground state of the Hofstadter-Bose-Hubbard (HBH) model, an interacting boson system on a two-dimensional square lattice with a perpendicular magnetic field. Our results indicate that increasing magnetic flux leads to a substantial increase in energy error, up to three orders of magnitude. Importantly, this decline in NQS performance is consistent across different optimization methods, neural network architectures, and physical model parameters, suggesting a significant challenge intrinsic to the model. Despite investigating potential causes such as wave function phase structure, quantum entanglement, fractional quantum Hall effect, and the variational loss landscape, the precise reasons for this degradation remain elusive. The HBH model thus proves to be an effective testing ground for exploring the capabilities and limitations of NQS. Our study highlights the need for advanced theoretical frameworks to better understand the expressive power of NQS which would allow a systematic development of methods that could potentially overcome these challenges.

TI Multi-mouth traversable wormholes
SO JOURNAL OF HIGH ENERGY PHYSICS
AB We describe the construction of traversable wormholes with multiple mouths in four spacetime dimensions and discuss associated quantum entanglement. Our wormholes may be traversed between any pair of mouths. In particular, in the three-mouth case they have fundamental group F-2 (the free group on two generators). By contrast, connecting three regions A, B, C in pairs (AB, BC, and AC) using three separate wormholes would give fundamental group F-3. Our solutions are asymptotically flat up to the presence of possible magnetic fluxes or cosmic strings that extend to infinity. The construction begins with a two-mouth traversable wormhole supported by backreaction from quantum fields. Inserting a sufficiently small black hole into its throat preserves traversability between the original two mouths. This black hole is taken to be the mouth of another wormhole connecting the original throat to a new distant region of spacetime. Making the new wormhole traversable in a manner similar to the original two-mouth wormhole provides the desired causal connections. From a dual field theory point of view, when AdS asymptotics are added to our construction, multiparty entanglement may play an important role in the traversability of the resulting wormhole.

TI Spin-orbit coupling in van der Waals materials for optical vortex
   generation
SO LIGHT-SCIENCE & APPLICATIONS
AB An optical vortex beam has attracted significant attention across diverse applications, including optical manipulation, phase-contrast microscopy, optical communication, and quantum photonics. To utilize vortex generators for integrated photonics, researchers have developed ultra-compact vortex generators using fork gratings, metasurfaces, and integrated microcombs. However, those devices depend on costly, time-consuming nanofabrication and are constrained by the low signal-to-noise ratio due to the fabrication error. As an alternative maneuver, spin-orbit coupling has emerged as a method to obtain the vortex beam by converting spin angular momentum (SAM) without nanostructures. Here, we demonstrate the creation of an optical vortex beam using van der Waals (vdW) materials. The significantly high birefringence of vdW materials allows the generation of optical vortex beams, even with materials of sub-wavelength thickness. In this work, we utilize an 8 mu m-thick hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) crystal for the creation of optical vortices carrying topological charges of +/- 2. We also present the generation of an optical vortex beam in a 320 nm-thick MoS2 crystal with a conversion efficiency of 0.09. This study paves the way for fabrication-less and ultra-compact optical vortex generators, which can be applied for integrated photonics and large-scale vortex generator arrays.

TI Direct nano-imaging of light-matter interactions in nanoscale excitonic
   emitters
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Strong light-matter interactions in localized nano-emitters placed near metallic mirrors have been widely reported via spectroscopic studies in the optical far-field. Here, we report a near-field nano-spectroscopic study of localized nanoscale emitters on a flat Au substrate. Using quasi 2-dimensional CdSe/CdxZn1-xS nanoplatelets, we observe directional propagation on the Au substrate of surface plasmon polaritons launched from the excitons of the nanoplatelets as wave-like fringe patterns in the near-field photoluminescence maps. These fringe patterns were confirmed via extensive electromagnetic wave simulations to be standing-waves formed between the tip and the edge-up assembled nano-emitters on the substrate plane. We further report that both light confinement and in-plane emission can be engineered by tuning the surrounding dielectric environment of the nanoplatelets. Our results lead to renewed understanding of in-plane, near-field electromagnetic signal transduction from the localized nano-emitters with profound implications in nano and quantum photonics as well as resonant optoelectronics.
   Authors investigate quasi-2D nanoscale emitters on different substrates with tapping mode tip-enhanced spectroscopy. They visualize in-plane near-field and radiative energy propagation via Surface plasmon polaritons launched by the nanoscale emitters on dielectric/Au or SiO2/Si substrates.

TI Equivalent Keys: Side-Channel Countermeasure for Post-Quantum
   Multivariate Quadratic Signatures
SO ELECTRONICS
AB Algorithms based on the hardness of solving multivariate quadratic equations present promising candidates for post-quantum digital signatures. Contemporary threats to implementations of cryptographic algorithms, especially in embedded systems, include side-channel analysis, where attacks such as differential power analysis allow for the extraction of secret keys from the device's power consumption or its electromagnetic emission. To prevent these attacks, various countermeasures must be implemented. In this paper, we propose a novel side-channel countermeasure for multivariate quadratic digital signatures through the concept of equivalent private keys. We propose a random equivalent key to be generated prior to every signing, thus randomizing the computation and mitigating side-channel attacks. We demonstrate our approach on the Rainbow digital signature, but since an unbalanced oil and vinegar is its special case, our work is applicable to other multivariate quadratic signature schemes as well. We analyze the proposed countermeasure regarding its properties such as the number of different equivalent keys or the amount of required fresh randomness, and we propose an efficient way to implement the countermeasure. We evaluate its performance regarding side-channel leakage and time/memory requirements. Using test vector leakage assessment, we were not able to detect any statistically significant leakage from our protected implementation.

CL ELECTR NETWORK
AB Hamming Quasi-Cyclic (HQC) is a code-based candidate of NIST post-quantum standardization procedure. The decoding steps of code-based cryptosystems are known to be vulnerable to side-channel attacks and HQC is no exception to this rule. In this paper, we present a new key recovery side-channel attack on HQC with chosen ciphertext. Our attack takes advantage of the reuse of a static secret key on a micro-controller with a physical access. The goal is to retrieve the static secret key by targeting the Reed-Muller decoding step of the decapsulation and more precisely the Hadamard transform. This function is known for its diffusion property, a property that we exploit through side-channel analysis. The side-channel information is used to build an Oracle that distinguishes between several decoding patterns of the Reed-Muller codes. We show how to query the Oracle such that the responses give a full information about the static secret key. Experiments show that less than 20.000 electromagnetic attack traces are sufficient to retrieve the whole static secret key used for the decapsulation. Finally, we present a masking-based countermeasure to thwart our attack.

TI Stable and selectable generation of LP/CVB/OAM modes in an all-fiber
   ring laser via a low modal-crosstalk mode multiplexer/demultiplexer
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB A universal scheme for stable and selectable LP, CVB, and OAM beam generation in an all-fiber ring laser is proposed and experimentally demonstrated. Lasing in a specific or arbitrary combination of multiple transverse modes is achieved by integrating a low modal-crosstalk mode multiplexer/demultiplexer (MUX/DEMUX) and a simple N x 1 optical switch into the laser cavity. The LP modes are generated using a mode MUX composed of cascaded mode-selective couplers, fabricated by tapering a designed weakly coupled six-mode double-ring-core fiber and a single-mode fiber. By leveraging the conversion relations among LP, CVB, and OAM modes, CVB/OAM outputs are obtained through precise control of polarization states and LP mode combinations. The mode intensity profiles, slope efficiencies, optical spectra, and stabilities of the generated LP/CVB/OAM lasing beams are investigated. Experimental results show that the proposed universal and compact all-fiber laser has promising applications in optical communication systems, high-resolution imaging, particle trapping, high-dimensional quantum entanglement, and material processing.

TI A QUANTUM GAMING STUDY ON THEPRICING OF FRESH MIXED DUAL-CHANNEL SUPPLY
   CHAINS CONSIDERING THE LEVEL OF PRESERVATION EFFORT
SO JOURNAL OF INDUSTRIAL AND MANAGEMENT OPTIMIZATION
AB As "Internet+" technology and e-commerce third-party platforms evolve, consumer options for purchasing fresh products now include both offline and online channels, giving rise to a mixed dual-channel supply chain. We examine this dual-channel supply chain, constructing a market demand function influenced by fresh produce pricing and preservation efforts.Optimal strategies for each stakeholder and the supply chain's maximum profit are analyzed through both classical and quantum game theory. The results indicate that under centralized decision-making, the equilibrium solutions are identical for classical and quantum games, with the quantum entanglement degree gamma = 0. In scenarios where market demand exhibits low sensitivity to freshness preservation efforts, the entanglement degree between suppliers and retailers can be elevated by implementing a "freshness preservation cost-sharing + revenue-sharing contract," thereby enhancing supply chain efficiency and profit. This study contributes to the literature by offering new theoretical insights into mitigating free-riding behavior in fresh food retail and explores the potential applications of quantum games in economics.

TI Unfolding Post-Quantum Cryptosystems: CRYSTALS-Dilithium, McEliece,

SO MATHEMATICS
AB The advent of quantum computers poses a significant threat to the security of classical cryptographic systems. To address this concern, researchers have been actively investigating the development of post-quantum cryptography, which aims to provide encryption schemes that remain secure even in the face of powerful quantum adversaries. To address this serious problem, the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), a body of the US government, has been working on the selection and standardization of cryptographic algorithms through competitive and rigorous evaluation on different fronts. NIST has selected different candidate algorithms to standardize public-key encryption, including key establishment algorithms and digital signature algorithms. This paper reviews some selected cryptosystems, mainly based on lattice- and code-based cryptosystems. These include digital signature algorithms, such as CRYSTALS-Dilithium, code-based cryptosystems, such as McEliece, and key encapsulation methods, specifically, Classic McEliece, BIKE and HQC. We will review these algorithms and discuss their security aspects and the current state-of-the-art in the development of these algorithms post NIST 3rd finalized selection. We will also touch briefly on the differences and practical applications of each of these schema. This review is intended for engineers and practitioners alike.

We found the novel universality of the entanglement entropy first law in the high quark density limit. We also showed that a correlation function generally decreases as the entanglement entropy of the background medium increases due to the screening effect of the background. We study the UV and IR effects of the medium on phase transition behaviour observed in the holographic mutual information using both perturbative and numerical computations. Moreover, by numerical computation, we show that in the IR region the critical length obtained from the mutual information behaves similar to the correlation length of the two-point function.

TI Lattices-Inspired CP-ABE from LWE Scheme for Data Access and Sharing
   Based on Blockchain
SO APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL
AB To address the quantum attacks on number theory-based ciphertext policy attribute-based encryption (CP-ABE), and to avoid private key leakage problems by relying on a trustworthy central authority, we propose a lattice-inspired CP-ABE scheme for data access and sharing based on blockchain in this paper. Firstly, a CP-ABE-based algorithm using learning with errors (LWE) assumption is constructed, which is selective security under linear independence restriction in the random oracle model. Secondly, the blockchain nodes can act as a distributed key management server to offer control over master keys used to generate private keys for different data users that reflect their attributes through launching transactions on the blockchain system. Finally, we develop smart contracts for proving the correctness of proxy re-encryption (PRE) and provide auditability for the whole data-sharing process. Compared with the traditional CP-ABE algorithm, the post-quantum CP-ABE algorithm can significantly improve the computation speed according to the result of the functional and experimental analysis. Moreover, the proposed blockchain-based CP-ABE scheme provides not only multi-cryptography collaboration to enhance the security of data access and sharing but also reduces average transaction response time and throughput.

TI Strong Resonant Enhancement in Polarization Anisotropy in Third Harmonic
   Generation from MoS2 Disks with Subtle Structural Ellipticity
SO ADVANCED PHOTONICS RESEARCH
AB Transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDC) are emerging as promising photonic platforms with favorable optical properties such as high refractive index, wide optical transparency window, and strong nonlinear optical susceptibilities. The electric field enhancement achievable within TMDC resonant subwavelength resonant structures can result in multifold enhancements in nonlinear optical processes. Herein, strong resonant enhancement in polarization anisotropy in third harmonic generation (THG) from isolated MoS2 disk resonators is reported due to small structural ellipticity introduced during fabrication. The anisotropic optical response from the disks results in noticeable spectral shifts in the reflectance dip and THG peak for orthogonally polarized fundamental excitations. Polarization dependent THG response also reveals significant deviations from the expected isotropic behavior for circular disk with highly polarization selective double-lobed and fourlobed profiles. The observed polarization selectivity is quantified using a contrast metric, which is as high as 47% for the THG measurements, while linear reflectance yields only 2%-4%. These observations are corroborated by electromagnetic simulations of polarization-resolved linear and THG response considering the small structural ellipticity. Resonant tuning of nonlinear signal polarization properties through subwavelength structure perturbation can be leveraged for selective polarization state generation or detection with applications in classical and quantum photonics.

TI Wafer-scale epitaxial modulation of quantum dot density
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Nucleation control of self-assembled quantum dots is challenging. Here, the authors employ conventional molecular beam epitaxy to achieve wafer-scale density modulation of high-quality quantum dots with tunable periodicity on unpatterned substrates.
   Precise control of the properties of semiconductor quantum dots (QDs) is vital for creating novel devices for quantum photonics and advanced opto-electronics. Suitable low QD-densities for single QD devices and experiments are challenging to control during epitaxy and are typically found only in limited regions of the wafer. Here, we demonstrate how conventional molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) can be used to modulate the density of optically active QDs in one- and two- dimensional patterns, while still retaining excellent quality. We find that material thickness gradients during layer-by-layer growth result in surface roughness modulations across the whole wafer. Growth on such templates strongly influences the QD nucleation probability. We obtain density modulations between 1 and 10 QDs/mu m(2) and periods ranging from several millimeters down to at least a few hundred microns. This method is universal and expected to be applicable to a wide variety of different semiconductor material systems. We apply the method to enable growth of ultra-low noise QDs across an entire 3-inch semiconductor wafer.

TI Shadow-wall lithography of ballistic superconductor-semiconductor
   quantum devices
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB The realization of hybrid superconductor-semiconductor quantum devices, in particular a topological qubit, calls for advanced techniques to readily and reproducibly engineer induced superconductivity in semiconductor nanowires. Here, we introduce an on-chip fabrication paradigm based on shadow walls that offers substantial advances in device quality and reproducibility. It allows for the implementation of hybrid quantum devices and ultimately topological qubits while eliminating fabrication steps such as lithography and etching. This is critical to preserve the integrity and homogeneity of the fragile hybrid interfaces. The approach simplifies the reproducible fabrication of devices with a hard induced superconducting gap and ballistic normal-/superconductor junctions. Large gate-tunable supercurrents and high-order multiple Andreev reflections manifest the exceptional coherence of the resulting nanowire Josephson junctions. Our approach enables the realization of 3-terminal devices, where zero-bias conductance peaks emerge in a magnetic field concurrently at both boundaries of the one-dimensional hybrids.
   Advanced fabrication techniques enable a wide range of quantum devices, such as the realization of a topological qubit. Here, the authors introduce an on-chip fabrication technique based on shadow walls to implement topological qubits in an InSb nanowire without fabrication steps such as lithography and etching.

TI Ultraviolet Laser Pulses with Multigigahertz Repetition Rate and
   Multiwatt Average Power for Fast Trapped-Ion Entanglement Operations
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW APPLIED
AB The conventional approach to perform two-qubit gate operations in trapped ions relies on exciting the ions on motional sidebands with laser light, which is an inherently slow process. One way to implement a fast entangling-gate protocol requires a suitable pulsed laser to increase the gate speed by orders of magnitude. However, the realization of such a fast entangling-gate operation presents a big technical challenge, as such the required laser source is not available off the shelf. For this, we engineer an ultrafast entangling-gate source based on a frequency comb. The source generates bursts of several hundred mode-locked pulses with pulse energy approximately 800 pJ at 5-GHz repetition rate at 393.3 nm and complies with all requirements for implementing a fast two-qubit gate operation. Using a single, chirped ultraviolet pulse, we demonstrate a rapid adiabatic passage in a Ca+ ion. To verify the applicability and projected performance of the laser system for inducing entangling gates we run simulations based on our source parameters. The gate time can be faster than a trap period with an error approaching 10(-4).

TI Asynchronous distribution scheme of group quantum keys based on max heap
   in classical network
SO JOURNAL OF KING SAUD UNIVERSITY COMPUTER AND INFORMATION SCIENCES
AB With the advancement of the information age, various information-based products have become increasingly prevalent, leading to a corresponding rise in the volume of data requiring encrypted transmission. Consequently, secure key distribution has become particularly critical, especially in large-scale communication scenarios. Considering practical limitations such as offline availability and low performance among communication participants, we propose an asynchronous group quantum key distribution scheme based on a max heap structure and blockchain technology within classical networks. In this scheme, quantum keys serve as group communication keys, and the encrypted transmission of quantum keys is facilitated through a max heap constructed according to user information. Specifically, during the initialization phase, users upload relevant information to the Key Distribution Center (KDC), while in the key distribution phase, the blockchain stores encrypted temporary group keys, enabling asynchronous access. The proposed scheme not only reduces performance consumption for users within the group but also leverages the intrinsic properties of the max heap to dynamically balance loads. Moreover, the scheme achieves both forward and backward secrecy and demonstrates favorable performance in terms of storage efficiency and computational cost.

TI Dynamics of charge fluctuations from asymmetric initial states
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
AB Conserved-charge densities are very special observables in quantum many-body systems as, by construction, they encode information about the dynamics. Therefore, their evolution is expected to be of much simpler interpretation than that of generic observables and to return universal information on the state of the system at any given time. Here, we study the dynamics of the fluctuations of conserved U(1) charges in systems that are prepared in charge-asymmetric initial states. We characterize the charge fluctuations in a given subsystem using the full-counting statistics of the truncated charge and the quantum entanglement between the subsystem and the rest resolved to the symmetry sectors of the charge. We show that, even though the initial states considered are homogeneous in space, the charge fluctuations generate an effective inhomogeneity due to the charge-asymmetric nature of the initial states. We use this observation to map the problem into that of charge fluctuations on inhomogeneous, charge-symmetric states and treat it using a recently developed space-time duality approach. Specializing the treatment to interacting integrable systems we combine the space-time duality approach with generalized hydrodynamics to find explicit predictions.

TI Experimental realization of efficient nondegenerate four-wave mixing in
   cesium atoms
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB Nondegenerate four-wave mixing (FWM) in diamond-type atomic systems has important applications in a wide range of fields, including quantum entanglement generation, frequency conversion, and optical information processing. Although the efficient self-seeded nondegenerate FWM with amplified spontaneous emission (ASE) has been realized extensively, the seeded nondegenerate FWM without ASE is inefficient in reported experiments so far. Here we present the experimental realization of the seeded nondegenerate FWM in cesium atoms with a significantly improved efficiency. Specifically, with two pump lasers at 852 and 921 nm and a seed laser at 895 nm, a continuous-wave laser at 876 nm is efficiently generated via FWM in a cesium vapor cell with a power up to 1.2 mW, three orders of magnitude larger than what has been achieved in previous experiments. The improvement of the efficiency benefits from the exact satisfaction of the phase-matching condition realized by an elaborately designed setup. Our results may find applications in the generation of squeezing and entanglement of light via nondegenerate FWM.

TI Complementarity-entanglement tradeoff in quantum gravity
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW D
AB The quantization of gravity remains one of the most important???yet extremely elusive???challenges at the heart of modern physics. Any attempt to resolve this long-standing problem seems to be doomed, as the route to any direct empirical evidence (i.e., detecting gravitons) that sheds light on the quantum aspect of gravity is far beyond the current capabilities. Recently, it was discovered that gravitationally induced entanglement, tailored in the interferometric frameworks, can be used to witness the quantum nature of gravity. Even though these schemes offer promising tools for investigating quantum gravity, many fundamental and empirical aspects of the schemes are yet to be discovered. Considering the fact that, besides quantum entanglement, the quantum uncertainty and complementarity principles are the two other foundational aspects of quantum physics, the quantum nature of gravity needs to manifest all of these features. Here, we lay out an interferometric platform for testing these nonclassical aspects of quantum mechanics in the quantum gravity setting, which connects gravity and quantum physics in a broader and deeper context. As we show in this work, all of these fundamental features of quantum gravity can be framed and thoroughly analyzed in an interferometric scheme.

TI Entanglement and confinement in coupled quantum systems
SO JOURNAL OF HIGH ENERGY PHYSICS
AB We study some general properties of coupled quantum systems. We consider simple interactions between two copies of identical Hamiltonians such as the SYK model, Pauli spin chains with random magnetic field and harmonic oscillators. Such couplings make the ground states close to the thermofield double states of the uncoupled Hamiltonians. For the coupled SYK model, we push the numerical computation further towards the thermodynamic limit so that an extrapolation in the size of the system is possible. We find good agreement between the extrapolated numerical result and the analytic result in the large-q limit. We also consider the coupled gauged matrix model and vector model, and argue that the deconfinement is associated with the loss of the entanglement, similarly to the previous observation for the coupled SYK model. The understanding of the microscopic mechanism of the confinement/deconfinement transition enables us to estimate the quantum entanglement precisely, and backs up the dual gravity interpretation which relates the deconfinement to the disappearance of the wormhole. Our results demonstrate the importance of the entanglement between the color degrees of freedom in the emergence of the bulk geometry from quantum field theory via holography.

TI Lorentz violation alleviates gravitationally induced entanglement
   degradation
SO JOURNAL OF HIGH ENERGY PHYSICS
AB Lorentz violation is a significant phenomenon in the framework of quantum physics, with implications for fundamental symmetries. In this paper, we explore the effects of Lorentz violation on quantum entanglement through a black hole spacetime that is coupled with a Lorentz-violating field. We establish the relationship between the Hartle-Hawking vacuum state and the Boulware number states for this case, and employ the near horizon approximation in an appropriate form to rewrite the black hole metric into a Rindler-like form. Subsequently, using this revised metric, the analytical forms of logarithmic negativity and mutual information are derived and plotted as functions of Rob's distance from the r = 0 point. Based on the results, we find that the coupling between spacetime and the Lorentz-violating vector field alleviates gravity-induced entanglement degradation. At high mode frequencies, the effects of Lorentz violation are negligible, but they become significant at low frequencies. This suggests that investigating Lorentz violation at astrophysical scales requires low-frequency detectors, as the low energy of these fields enhances the significance of the Lorentz-violating field's non-zero vacuum expectation value.

TI Free-space realization of tunable pin-like optical vortex beams
SO PHOTONICS RESEARCH
AB We demonstrate, both analytically and experimentally, free-space pin-like optical vortex beams (POVBs). Such angular-momentum-carrying beams feature tunable peak intensity and undergo robust antidiffracting propagation, realized by judiciously modulating both the amplitude and the phase profile of a standard laser beam. Specifically, they are generated by superimposing a radially symmetric power-law phase on a helical phase structure, which allows the inclusion of an orbital angular momentum term to the POVBs. During propagation in free space, these POVBs initially exhibit autofocusing dynamics, and subsequently their amplitude patterns morph into a high-order Bessel-like profile characterized by a hollow core and an annular main lobe with a constant or tunable width during propagation. In contrast with numerous previous endeavors on Bessel beams, our work represents the first demonstration of long-distance free-space generation of optical vortex "pins" with their peak intensity evolution controlled by the impressed amplitude structure. Both the Poynting vectors and the optical radiation forces associated with these beams are also numerically analyzed, revealing novel properties that may be useful for a wide range of applications.

Here we present a method, classical entanglement forging, that harnesses classical resources to capture quantum correlations and double the size of the system that can be simulated on quantum hardware. Shifting some of the computation to classical postprocessing allows us to represent ten spin orbitals of the water molecule on five qubits of an IBM Quantum processor in the most accurate variational simulation of the H2O ground-state energy using quantum hardware to date. We discuss conditions for applicability of classical entanglement forging and present a roadmap for scaling to larger problems.

TI Experimental demonstration of the time-dependent source side-channel and
   countermeasures in polarization-based BB84 QKD systems
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB High-speed is one development tendency of the practical and commercial quantum key distribution (QKD) systems, and the gain-switched semiconductor laser (GSSL) and Sagnac interferometer have been popular components for high-speed commercial polarization-based BB84 QKD systems thanks to their stability, compactness and low cost. However, due to the finite extinction ratio (ER) of the GSSL, the time-dependent source side-channel, which is theoretically presented in [Phys. Rev. A 106 (6): 062618 (2022)], also exists in these QKD systems. In this article, we experimentally investigate this side-channel in the polarization-based BB84 QKD system. The results show an obvious correlation in the output polarization states between the weak leakage light and its adjacent pulses, which will cause information to leak. More importantly, we have proposed several countermeasures, retested the side channel, and developed a mathematical framework to quantitatively assess the impact of the time-dependent side channel and these countermeasures on the secure key rate. Finally, we offer a trade-off analysis that considers defense effectiveness, pulse impact, and cost for various countermeasures in QKD. This provides a practical recommendation for improving the security of QKD systems.

TI Modulating thermal robustness and entanglement distribution in a
   two-dimensional dissipative spin system using impurities
SO RESULTS IN PHYSICS
AB We consider a finite two-dimensional Heisenberg triangular spin lattice coupled to a dissipative Markovian environment at finite temperature in the presence of an external uniform magnetic field. We show how inserting a magnetic impurity in the spin system can be used to effectively control the dynamics and asymptotic state of the system. A strong impurity, at a border or central site, was found to enhance its entanglement with the other spins and their thermal robustness to the dissipative environment reaching an asymptotic state that is inde-pendent of the system initial state. However, it reduces the entanglement among the other spins in the lattice and their thermal robustness and may diminish them depending on its strength and the environment temperature. Moreover, the effect of the impurity increases significantly as the degree of anisotropy of the spin system in-creases. Therefore, the entanglement distribution over the different sites of the lattice can be modulated by tuning the impurity strength, system anisotropy and environment temperature. The impurity can be used as a switch that turns the entanglement on among specific spins and off among others simultaneously.

TI Defining the Semiclassical Limit of the Quantum Rabi Hamiltonian
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB The crossover from quantum to semiclassical behavior in the seminal Rabi model of light-matter interaction still, surprisingly, lacks a complete and rigorous understanding. A formalism for deriving the semiclassical model directly from the quantum Hamiltonian is developed here. Working in a displaced Fock-state basis j alpha; ni, the semiclassical limit is obtained by taking j alpha j -> infinity and the coupling to zero. This resolves the discrepancy between coherent-state dynamics and semiclassical Rabi oscillations in both standard and ultrastrong coupling and driving regimes. Furthermore, it provides a framework for studying the quantum-to-semiclassical transition, with potential applications in quantum technologies.

TI Practical Key-Recovery Attack on MQ-Sign and More

CT 15th International Workshop on Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQCrypto)
CY JUN 12-14, 2024

AB In this paper we describe attacks on the UOV-based signature scheme called MQ-Sign. MQ-Sign was submitted by Shim, Kim, and An as a first-round candidate for standardization in the (South) Korean post-quantum cryptography competition (KpqC). The scheme makes use of sparseness of the secret central polynomials and equivalent key construction to reduce the size of the private key. The authors propose four variants exploiting different levels of sparsity, MQ-Sign-SS, MQ-Sign-RS, MQ-Sign-SR, and MQ-Sign-RR with the last one being the standard UOV signature scheme.
   We show that apart from the MQ-Sign-RR variant, all the others are insecure. Namely, we present a polynomial-time key-recovery attack on the variants MQ-Sign-SS and MQ-Sign-RS and a forgery attack on the variant MQ-Sign-SR below the claimed security level. Our attack exploits exactly the techniques used for reduction of keys - the sparsity of the central polynomials in combination with the specific structure of the secret linear map S.
   We provide a verification script for the polynomial-time key-recovery attack, that recovers the secret key in less than seven seconds for security level V. Furthermore, we provide an implementation of the non-guessing part of the forgery attack, confirming our complexity estimates.

TI Deterministic Fabrication of Plasmonic Nanostructures on Optical
   Nanofibers via Blurred Electron Beam Deposition
SO ADVANCED SCIENCE
AB This study introduces a novel method for the deterministic fabrication of metallic nanostructures with controlled geometry and composition on suspended, single-mode tapered optical nanofibers (TNFs) using a tailored Blurred Electron Beam Induced Deposition (BEBID) technique. TNFs, owing to their subwavelength diameters and intense evanescent fields, offer a unique platform for enhanced light-matter interactions at the nanoscale. However, their mechanical fragility has thus far hindered the integration of plasmonic structures using conventional high-energy deposition methods. BEBID addresses this limitation by deliberately defocusing the electron beam to reduce local mechanical stress, minimize vibration, and prevent fiber damage during deposition, thereby enabling the one-step growth of platinum nanopillars with sub-20 nm spatial precision and high structural fidelity directly on suspended TNFs. The fabricated structures are characterized using SEM, EDX, and their optical properties are investigated through broadband scattering spectra and polarization-resolved measurements, showing strong agreement with Finite-Difference Time-Domain (FDTD) simulations. Numerical modeling further reveals that ordered arrays of nanopillars can shape and direct the scattered field along the fiber axis, enabling directional emission. This work establishes BEBID as a versatile nanofabrication approach for functional photonic architectures on fragile substrates, with direct applications in quantum photonics, nano-optics, and on-fiber plasmonic sensing.

TI Polynomial reduction from syndrome decoding problem to regular decoding
   problem
SO DESIGNS CODES AND CRYPTOGRAPHY
AB The regular decoding problem asks for (the existence of) regular solutions to a syndrome decoding problem (SDP). This problem has increased applications in post-quantum cryptography and cryptanalysis. Recently, Esser and Santini explored in depth the connection between the regular (RSD) and classical syndrome decoding problems. They have observed that while RSD to SDP reductions are known (in any parametric regime), a similar generic reduction from SDP to RSD is not known. In our contribution, we examine two different generic polynomial reductions from a syndrome decoding problem to a regular decoding problem instance. The first reduction is based on constructing a special parity check matrix that encodes weight counter progression inside the parity check matrix, which is then the input of the regular decoding oracle. The target regular decoding problem has a significantly longer code length, that depends linearly on the weight parameter of the original SDP. The second reduction is based on translating the SDP to a non-linear system of equations in the Multiple Right-Hand Sides form, and then applying RSD oracle to solve this system. The second reduction has better code length. The ratio between RSD and SDP code length of the second reduction can be bounded by a constant (less than 8).

TI Tunable quasi-bound states in the continuum with intrinsic chirality in
   a phase-change metasurface
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB The realization of switchable high-Q factors with intrinsic chirality is of paramount importance for various applications involving active and nonlinear metadevices that exhibit chiral responses. Here, we present a chiral metasurface that employs amorphous phase-change material, which enables the formation of quasi-bound states in the continuum characterized by inherent optical chirality. By simultaneously breaking both in-plane and out-of-plane symmetries, the metasurface supports multiple high-Q resonances that produce pronounced circular dichroism responses. Through eigenmode simulations and multipolar decomposition analysis, we demonstrate that the quasi-bound states in the continuum originate from various multipolar contributions. These modes are distinguished by sharp spectral features and circular dichroism values nearing unity, indicating near-perfect polarization selectivity. Furthermore, we illustrate that the intrinsic chirality and high-Q response can be actively deactivated by inducing the phase transition in the Ge2Sb2Te5 material to its crystalline state, which leads to significant optical losses and the suppression of the quasi-bound states in the continuum. Our findings establish a versatile and tunable photonic platform for dynamically reconfigurable chiroptical devices, offering promising prospects for applications in optical communication, biosensing, and quantum photonics.

TI Memory-Saving and High-Speed Privacy Amplification Algorithm Using
   LFSR-Based Hash Function for Key Generation
SO ELECTRONICS
AB Privacy amplification is an indispensable procedure for key generation in the quantum key distribution system and the physical layer key distribution system. In this paper, we propose a high-speed privacy amplification algorithm that saves hardware memory and improves the key randomness performance. Based on optimizing the structure of the Toeplitz matrix generated by a linear feedback shift register, the core of our algorithm is a block-iterative structure hash function that is used to generate a secure key of arbitrary length. The proposed algorithm adopts multiple small Toeplitz matrices to compress the negotiation key for convenient implementation. The negotiated key is equally divided into multiple small blocks, and the multiplication operation of the negotiated key with the Toeplitz matrix is converted into a modular addition operation through an accumulator. The analysis results demonstrate that the algorithm has the advantages of saving memory and running quickly. In addition, the NIST randomness test and avalanche effect test on the key sequences indicate that the proposed algorithm has a favorable performance.

TI Quantum Steering in Two- and Three-Mode PT-Symmetric Systems
SO SYMMETRY-BASEL
AB We consider two PT-symmetric models, consisting of two or three single-mode cavities. In both models, the cavities are coupled to each other by linear interactions, forming a linear chain. Additionally, the first and last of such cavities interact with an environment. Since the models are PT-symmetric, they are described by non-Hermitian Hamiltonians that, for a specific range of system parameters, possess real eigenvalues. We show that in the models considered in the article, the steering generation process strongly depends on the coupling strengths and rates of the gains/losses in energy. Moreover, we find the values of parameters describing the system for which the steering appears.

TI Optimization of selective two-photon absorption in cavity polaritons
SO JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL PHYSICS
AB We investigate optimal states of photon pairs to excite a target transition in a multilevel quantum system. With the help of coherent control theory for two-photon absorption with quantum light, we infer the maximal population achievable by optimal entangled vs separable states of light. Interference between excitation pathways as well as the presence of nearby states may hamper the selective excitation of a particular target state, but we show that quantum correlations can help to overcome this problem and enhance the achievable "selectivity" between two energy levels, i.e., the relative difference in population transferred into each of them. We find that the added value of optimal entangled states of light increases with broadening linewidths of the target states.

TI In-lab demonstration of coherent one-way protocol over free space with
   turbulence simulation
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB Over the last decade, free-space quantum key distribution (QKD), a secure key sharing protocol, has risen in popularity due the adaptable nature of free-space networking and the near-term potential to share quantum-secure encryption keys over a global scale. While the literature has primarily focused on polarization based-protocols for free-space transmission, there are benefits to implementing other protocols, particularly when operating at fast clock-rates, such as in the GHz. In this paper, we experimentally demonstrate a time-bin QKD system, implementing the coherent one-way (COW) at 1 GHz clock frequency, utilizing a free-space channel and receiver. We demonstrate the receiver's robustness to atmospheric turbulence, maintaining an operational visibility of 92%, by utilizing a lab-based turbulence simulator. With a fixed channel loss of 16 dB, discounting turbulence, we obtain secret key rate (SKR) of 6.4 kbps, 3.4 kbps, and 270 bps for three increasing levels of turbulence. Our results highlight that turbulence must be better accounted for in free-space QKD modelling due to the additional induced loss.

TI Naturally occurring layered mineral franckeite with anisotropic Raman
   scattering and third-harmonic generation responses
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB Vertically stacked van der Waals (vdW) heterostructures have introduced a unique way to engineer optical and electronic responses in multifunctional photonic and quantum devices. However, the technical challenges associated with the artificially fabricated vertical heterostructures have emerged as a bottleneck to restrict their proficient utilization, which emphasizes the necessity of exploring naturally occurring vdW heterostructures. As one type of naturally occurring vdW heterostructures, franckeite has recently attracted significant interest in optoelectronic applications, but the understanding of light-matter interactions in such layered mineral is still very limited especially in the nonlinear optical regime. Herein, the anisotropic Raman scattering and third-harmonic generation (THG) from mechanically exfoliated franckeite thin flakes are investigated. The observed highly anisotropic Raman modes and THG emission patterns originate from the low-symmetry crystal structure of franckeite induced by the lattice incommensurability between two constituent stacked layers. The thickness-dependent anisotropic THG response is further analyzed to retrieve the third-order nonlinear susceptibility for franckeite crystal. The results discussed herein not only provide new insights in engineering the nonlinear light-matter interactions in natural vdW heterostructures, but also develop a testbed for designing future miniaturized quantum photonics devices and circuits based on such heterostructures.

TI Photonic-Defect Cavities as Next-Generation Room-Temperature
   Microlasers: A Comparative Study with Micropillars
SO LASER & PHOTONICS REVIEWS
AB Room-temperature operable microlasers are essential for advancing quantum photonics and integrated photonic circuits, enabling a wide range of practical applications. In this study, the lasing performance of two types of optically pumped InGaAs quantum dot microcavities - namely, micropillar and photonic-defect cavities - is systematically compared at elevated temperatures. A comprehensive analysis of device designs through simulations, followed by the fabrication and experimental studies of both structures, allows for a direct performance evaluation. Excitation-power-dependent input/output measurements confirm lasing up to 200 K in the micropillar case, where the performance is constrained by sidewall losses, pump power absorption, and inefficient heat dissipation. In contrast, the photonic-defect cavity demonstrates stable continuous-wave lasing even at room-temperature (300 K), attributed mainly to superior thermal management in the quasi-planar cavity design. Additionally, in the photonic-defect cavity with low-absorbing upper mirror, Raman spectroscopy verifies efficient optical pumping, while second-order autocorrelation measurements provide unambiguous proof of lasing at 300 K. Overall, the quasi-planar geometry of the photonic-defect cavity shows high temperature stability and supports flexible fabrication, establishing it as a promising concept for practical microlaser applications.

TI Experimentally friendly approach towards nonlocal correlations in
   multisetting N-partite Bell scenarios
SO QUANTUM
AB In this work, we study a recently proposed operational measure of nonlocality by Fonseca and Parisio [Phys. Rev. A 92 , 030101(R) (2015)] which describes the probability of violation of local realism under randomly sampled observables, and the strength of such violation as described by resistance to white noise admixture. While our knowledge concerning these quantities is well established from a theoretical point of view, the experimental counterpart is a considerably harder task and very little has been done in this field. It is caused by the lack of complete knowledge about the facets of the local polytope required for the analysis. In this paper, we propose a simple procedure towards experimentally determining both quantities for N-qubit pure states, based on the incomplete set of tight Bell inequalities. We show that the imprecision arising from this approach is of similar magnitude as the potential measurement errors. We also show that even with both a randomly chosen N-qubit pure state and randomly chosen measurement bases, a violation of local realism can be detected experimentally almost 100% of the time. Among other applications, our work provides a feasible alternative for the witnessing of genuine multipartite entanglement without aligned reference frames.

TI Beating signals in CdSe quantum dots measured by low-temperature 2D
   spectroscopy
SO JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL PHYSICS
AB Advances in ultrafast spectroscopy can provide access to dynamics involving nontrivial quantum correlations and their evolutions. In coherent 2D spectroscopy, the oscillatory time dependence of a signal is a signature of such quantum dynamics. Here, we study such beating signals in electronic coherent 2D spectroscopy of CdSe quantum dots (CdSe QDs) at 77 K. The beating signals are analyzed in terms of their positive and negative Fourier components. We conclude that the beatings originate from coherent LO-phonons of CdSe QDs. No evidence for the QD size dependence of the LO-phonon frequency was identified. Published under an exclusive license by AIP Publishing.

TI Canonical description of cosmological backreaction
SO JOURNAL OF COSMOLOGY AND ASTROPARTICLE PHYSICS
AB Canonical methods of quasiclassical dynamics make it possible to go beyond a strict background approximation for cosmological perturbations by including independent fields such as correlation degrees of freedom. New models are introduced and analyzed here for cosmological dynamics in the presence of quantum correlations between background and perturbations, as well as cross-correlations between different modes of a quantum field. Evolution equations for moments of a perturbation state reveal conditions required for inhomogeneity to build up out of an initial vacuum. A crucial role is played by quantum non-locality, formulated by canonical methods as an equivalent local theory with non-classical degrees of freedom given by moments of a quantum state.

TI Optimal control for maximally creating and maintaining a superposition
   state of a two-level system under the influence of Markovian decoherence
SO JOURNAL OF THE CHINESE CHEMICAL SOCIETY
AB Reducing decoherence is an essential step toward realizing general-purpose quantum computers beyond the present noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) computers. To this end, dynamical decoupling (DD) approaches in which external fields are applied to qubits are often adopted. We numerically study DD using a two-level model system (qubit) under the influence of Markovian decoherence by using quantum optimal control theory with slightly modified settings, in which the physical objective is to maximally create and maintain a specified superposition state in a specified control period. An optimal pulse is numerically designed while systematically varying the values of dephasing, population decay, pulse fluence, and control period as well as using two kinds of objective functionals. The decrease in purity due to the decoherence limits the ability to maintain a coherent superposition state; we refer to the state of maximal purity that can be maintained as the saturated value. The optimally shaped pulse minimizes the negative effect of decoherence by gradually populating and continuously replenishing the state of saturated purity.

TI Optimization of direct-detection quantum illumination
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Quantum illumination uses quantum correlations to improve the detection of objects in the presence of background noise. A simple and common practical approach to quantum illumination is to use threshold detectors to measure the idler mode. We investigate the optimization of these direct measurement protocols. Surprisingly, we find that there can be an advantage to having a signal detector whose quantum efficiency is significantly less than perfect, one that does not vanish for low object reflectivities or signal strengths. We also show that decreasing the separation between pulses, while keeping the rate of photons transmitted per second fixed, can improve the performance, under appropriate conditions. We further show that postselecting on the idler detector firing is less efficient at object detection than not postselecting.

AB Quantum state tomography (QST) aiming at reconstructing the density matrix of a quantum state plays an important role in various emerging quantum technologies. Recognizing the challenges posed by imperfect measurement data, we develop a unified neural network (NN)-based approach for QST under constrained measurement scenarios, including limited measurement copies, incomplete measurements, and noisy measurements. Through comprehensive comparison with other estimation methods, we demonstrate that our method improves the estimation accuracy in scenarios with limited measurement resources, showcasing notable robustness in noisy measurement settings. These findings highlight the capability of NNs to enhance QST with constrained measurements.

TI Imaging Strain-Localized Single-Photon Emitters in Layered GaSe below
   the Diffraction Limit
SO ACS NANO
AB Nanoscale strain control of exciton funneling is an increasingly critical tool for the scalable production of single photon emitters (SPEs) in two-dimensional materials. However, conventional far-field optical microscopies remain constrained in spatial resolution by the diffraction limit and thus can provide only a limited description of nanoscale strain localization of SPEs. Here, we quantify the effects of nanoscale heterogeneous strain on the energy and brightness of GaSe SPEs on nanopillars with correlative cathodoluminescence, photoluminescence, and atomic force microscopy, supported by density functional theory simulations. We report the strainlocalized SPEs have a broad range of emission wavelengths from 620 to 900 nm. We reveal substantial strain-controlled SPE wavelength tunability over a similar to 100 nm spectral range and 2 orders of magnitude enhancement in the SPE brightness at the pillar center due to Type-I exciton funneling. In addition, we show that radiative biexciton cascade processes contribute to observed CL photon superbunching. Also, the GaSe SPEs show excellent stability, where their properties remain unchanged after electron beam exposure. We anticipate that this comprehensive study on the nanoscale strain control of two-dimensional SPEs will provide key insights to guide the development of truly deterministic quantum photonics.

TI Improvement and security analysis of multi-ring discrete modulation
   continuous variable quantum secret sharing scheme
SO CHINESE PHYSICS B
AB In order to avoid the complexity of Gaussian modulation and the problem that the traditional point-to-point communication DM-CVQKD protocol cannot meet the demand for multi-user key sharing at the same time, we propose a multi-ring discrete modulation continuous variable quantum key sharing scheme (MR-DM-CVQSS). In this paper, we primarily compare single-ring and multi-ring M-symbol amplitude and phase-shift keying modulations. We analyze their asymptotic key rates against collective attacks and consider the security key rates under finite-size effects. Leveraging the characteristics of discrete modulation, we improve the quantum secret sharing scheme. Non-dealer participants only require simple phase shifters to complete quantum secret sharing. We also provide the general design of the MR-DM-CVQSS protocol. We conduct a comprehensive analysis of the improved protocol's performance, confirming that the enhancement through multi-ring M-PSK allows for longer-distance quantum key distribution. Additionally, it reduces the deployment complexity of the system, thereby increasing the practical value.

AB In this paper, the recommended implementation of the post-quantum key exchange SIKE for Cortex-M4 is attacked through power analysis with a single trace by clustering with the k-means algorithm the power samples of all the invocations of the elliptic curve point swapping function in the constant-time coordinate-randomized three point ladder. Because each sample depends on whether two consecutive bits of the private key are the same or not, a successful clustering (with k = 2) leads to the recovery of the entire private key. The attack is naturally improved with better strategies, such as clustering the samples in the frequency domain or processing the traces with a wavelet transform, using a simpler clustering algorithm based on thresholding, and using metrics to prioritize certain keys for key validation. The attack and the proposed improvements were experimentally verified using the ChipWhisperer framework. Splitting the swapping mask into multiple shares is suggested as an effective countermeasure.

TI Electrical excitation of color centers in n-type diamond Schottky diodes
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW APPLIED
AB Color centers in diamond are promising systems for quantum technologies and nanophotonics as they are photostable emitters at room and elevated temperatures. The possibility of their electrical excitation has already been demonstrated within p-i-n diodes. However, this requires the growth of complex diamond structures. In contrast to these conventional approaches, we demonstrate the emission from color centers under electrical pumping in a Schottky diode configuration based on n-type diamond. Hydrogen passivation allows the modification of the Schottky barrier height and improves the injection of minority charge carriers needed for the electrical pumping, while electrons are provided by the n-type layer.

TI Algebraic Supports and New Forms of the Hidden Discrete Logarithm
   Problem for Post-quantum Public-key Cryptoschemes
SO INTERNATIONAL ARAB JOURNAL OF INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY
AB This paper introduces two new forms of the hidden discrete logarithm problem defined over a finite noncommutative associative algebras containing a large set of global single-sided units. The proposed forms are promising for development on their base practical post-quantum public key-agreement schemes and are characterized in performing two different masking operations over the output value of the base exponentiation operation that is executed in framework of the public key computation. The masking operations represent homomorphisms and each of them is mutually commutative with the exponentiation operation. Parameters of the masking operations are used as private key elements. A 6-dimensional algebra containing a set of p(3) global left-sided units is used as algebraic support of one of the hidden logarithm problem form and a 4-dimensional algebra with p(2) global right-sided units is used to implement the other form of the said problem. The result of this paper is the proposed two methods for strengthened masking of the exponentiation operation and two new post-quantum public key-agreement cryptoschemes.

TI Non-commutative Ring Learning with Errors from Cyclic Algebras
SO JOURNAL OF CRYPTOLOGY
AB The Learning with Errors (LWE) problem is the fundamental backbone of modern lattice-based cryptography, allowing one to establish cryptography on the hardness of well-studied computational problems. However, schemes based on LWE are often impractical, so Ring LWE was introduced as a form of 'structured' LWE, trading off a hard to quantify loss of security for an increase in efficiency by working over a well-chosen ring. Another popular variant, Module LWE, generalizes this exchange by implementing a module structure over a ring. In this work, we introduce a novel variant of LWE over cyclic algebras (CLWE) to replicate the addition of the ring structure taking LWE to Ring LWE by adding cyclic structure to Module LWE. We show that the security reductions expected for an LWE problem hold, namely a reduction from certain structured lattice problems to the hardness of the decision variant of the CLWE problem (under the condition of constant rank d). As a contribution of theoretic interest, we view CLWE as the first variant of Ring LWE which supports non-commutative multiplication operations. This ring structure compares favorably with Module LWE, and naturally allows a larger message space for error correction coding.

TI Post-Quantum Two-Party Adaptor Signature Based on Coding Theory
SO CRYPTOGRAPHY
AB An adaptor signature can be viewed as a signature concealed with a secret value and, by design, any two of the trio yield the other. In a multiparty setting, an initial adaptor signature allows each party to create additional adaptor signatures without the original secret. Adaptor signatures help address scalability and interoperability issues in blockchain. They can also bring some important advantages to cryptocurrencies, such as low on-chain cost, improved transaction fungibility, and fewer limitations of a blockchain's scripting language. In this paper, we propose a new two-party adaptor signature scheme that relies on quantum-safe hard problems in coding theory. The proposed scheme uses a hash-and-sign code-based signature scheme introduced by Debris-Alazard et al. and a code-based hard relation defined from the well-known syndrome decoding problem. To achieve all the basic properties of adaptor signatures formalized by Aumayr et al., we introduce further modifications to the aforementioned signature scheme. We also give a security analysis of our scheme and its application to the atomic swap. After providing a set of parameters for our scheme, we show that it has the smallest pre-signature size compared to existing post-quantum adaptor signatures.

TI A 2-Gbps low-SWaP quantum random number generator with photonic
   integrated circuits for satellite applications
SO NPJ QUANTUM INFORMATION
AB We introduce a low size, weight and power quantum random number generator (QRNG) utilizing compact integrated photonic asymmetric Mach-Zehnder interferometers (AMZIs). Our QRNG is based on phase-diffusion in two gain-switched lasers interfered within two separate chip-AMZIs. By substituting the high-bit analog-to-digital converters, typically employed to digitize the random intensity signal from each laser, with clocked comparators we significantly reduce both the complexity and power consumption of the device. Furthermore, by performing the exclusive OR (XOR) operation on the output random bits of each channel we are able to reduce the processing requirements. The QRNG architecture can be integrated with an overhead power consumption of just 7.93 W, accounting for the opto-electronics and FPGA implementation, providing fast random number generation at up to 2 Gbps. We demonstrate the real-time seeding of a free-space decoy-state quantum key distribution system using our QRNG. Our design and implementation provides a practical solution for QRNGs requiring low-power and high bit rates. This advancement is important for practical QRNGs and particularly for application in resource-constrained environments such as space-based quantum key distribution.

TI Hamiltonian Ratchet for Matter-Wave Transport
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB We report on the design of a Hamiltonian ratchet exploiting periodically at rest integrable trajectories in the phase space of a modulated periodic potential, leading to the linear nondiffusive transport of particles. Using Bose-Einstein condensates in a modulated one-dimensional optical lattice, we make the first observations of this spatial ratchet, which provides way to coherently transport matter waves with possible applications in quantum technologies. In the semiclassical regime, the quantum transport strongly depends on the effective Planck constant due to Floquet state mixing. We also demonstrate the interest of quantum optimal control for efficient initial state preparation into the transporting Floquet states to enhance the transport periodicity.

TI Avoiding trusted setup in isogeny-based commitments
SO DESIGNS CODES AND CRYPTOGRAPHY
AB In 2021, Sterner proposed a commitment scheme based on supersingular isogenies. For this scheme to be binding, one relies on a trusted party to generate a starting supersingular elliptic curve of unknown endomorphism ring. In fact, the knowledge of the endomorphism ring allows one to compute an endomorphism of degree a power of a given small prime. Such an endomorphism can then be split into two to obtain two different messages with the same commitment. This is the reason why one needs a curve of unknown endomorphism ring, and the only known way to generate such supersingular curves is to rely on a trusted party or on some expensive multiparty computation. We observe that if the degree of the endomorphism in play is well chosen, then the knowledge of the endomorphism ring is not sufficient to efficiently compute such an endomorphism and in some particular cases, one can even prove that endomorphism of a certain degree do not exist. Leveraging these observations, we adapt Sterner's commitment scheme in such a way that the endomorphism ring of the starting curve can be known and public. This allows us to obtain isogeny-based commitment schemes which can be instantiated without trusted setup requirements.

Out of the very few existing post-quantum HPS, most are based on languages of ciphertexts of code-based or lattice-based cryptosystems and inherently suffer from a gap caused by the possibility for an ill-formed ciphertext to decrypt to a valid plaintext. Since this gap is inconvenient when proving the security in the universal composability framework by Canetti et al., Bettaieb et al. proposed the first gapless post-quantum HPS based on the Rank Quasi-Cyclic (RQC) cryptosystem in the rank metric while conjecturing the existence of a similar HPS in the usual Hamming metric. We solve this conjecture by designing a gapless post-quantum HPS based on the Hamming QuasiCyclic (HQC) cryptosystem which, in contrast to RQC, is a NIST postquantum cryptography standardization alternate candidate. We describe a novel proof of validity for HQC ciphertexts, thereby closing the adversarial gap and present a witness encryption scheme secure in the standard model and a password-based authenticated key exchange protocol secure in the Bellare-Pointcheval-Rogaway (BPR) model.

TI Chirality-Induced Orbital-Angular-Momentum Selectivity in Electron
   Transmission and Scattering
SO JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL THEORY AND COMPUTATION
AB Chirality-induced orbital-angular-momentum selectivity (CIOAMS) in electron transmission and scattering processes is investigated. Polarization of the OAM of an electron traversing chiral media is first studied via electronic wavepacket propagation using the time-dependent Schrodinger equation. Next, spatial resolution of wavepackets carrying opposite OAM, following scattering from a corrugated surface is demonstrated. This suggests that OAM may play a significant role in the mechanisms underlying chirality-induced spin selectivity, measured for electrons crossing chiral media in setups involving Mott polarimetry. Our results highlight the potential to exploit CIOAMS in innovative emerging quantum technologies.

TI Entanglement properties of SU(2) gauge theory
SO COMMUNICATIONS PHYSICS
AB Understanding how isolated quantum systems thermalize is central to both fundamental physics and the development of quantum technologies. In this Perspective, we present recent and new results on thermalization in nonabelian gauge theory from exact real-time simulations of two-dimensional lattice models. We discuss tests of the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis, entanglement entropy dynamics, the absence of persistent non-thermal states, spectral signatures, and measures of quantum complexity. Our new results include a two-step thermalization process in localized regions and the role of higher gauge field representations. These findings suggest that thermalization in gauge theories may offer a test case for quantum advantage.

TI Gate-controlled quantum dots in monolayer WSe2
SO APPLIED PHYSICS LETTERS
AB Quantum confinement and manipulation of charge carriers are critical for achieving devices practical for quantum technologies. The interplay between electron spin and valley, as well as the possibility to address their quantum states electrically and optically, makes two-dimensional (2D) transition metal dichalcogenides an emerging platform for the development of quantum devices. In this work, we fabricate devices based on heterostructures of layered 2D materials, in which we realize gate-controlled tungsten diselenide (WSe2) hole quantum dots. We discuss the observed mesoscopic transport features related to the emergence of quantum dots in the WSe2 device channel, and we compare them to a theoretical model.

SO ACS PHOTONICS
AB Plasmonic metamaterials provide a flexible platform for light manipulation and polarization management thanks to their engineered optical properties with exotic dispersion regimes. Here we exploit the enhanced spin-orbit coupling induced by the strong anisotropy of plasmonic nanorod metamaterials to control the polarization of vector vortex beams and generate complex field structures with meron topology. Modifying the degree of ellipticity of the input polarization, we show how the observed meron topology can be additionally manipulated. Flexible control of the state of polarization of vortex beams is important in optical manipulation, communications, metrology, and quantum technologies.

TI Causality in Higher Order Process Theories
SO ELECTRONIC PROCEEDINGS IN THEORETICAL COMPUTER SCIENCE
CT 18th International Conference on Quantum Physics and Logic
CY JUN 07-11, 2021
CL POLAND
AB Quantum supermaps provide a framework in which higher order quantum processes can act on lower order quantum processes. In doing so, they enable the definition and analysis of new quantum protocols and causal structures. Recently, key features of quantum supermaps were captured through a general categorical framework, which led to a framework of higher order process theories (HOPT) [89]. The HOPT framework models lower and higher order transformations in a single unified theory, with its mathematical structure shown to coincide with the notion of a closed symmetric monoidal category. Here we provide an equivalent construction of the HOPT framework from four simple axioms of process-theoretic nature. We then use the HOPT framework to establish connections between foundational features such as causality, determinism and signalling, alongside exploring their interaction with the mathematical structure of *-autonomy.

TI Integrated-waveguide-based acousto-optic modulation with complete
   optical conversion
SO OPTICA
AB Acousto-optic modulation in piezoelectric materials offers the efficient method to bridge electrical and optical signals. It is widely used to control optical frequencies and intensities in modern optical systems including Q -switch lasers, ion traps, and optical tweezers. It is also critical for emerging applications such as quantum photonics and non -reciprocal optics. Acousto-optic devices have recently been demonstrated with promising performance on integrated platforms. However, the conversion efficiency of optical signals remains low in these integrated devices. This is attributed to the significant challenge in realizing large mode overlap, long interaction length, and high power robustness at the same time. Here, we develop acousto-optic devices with gallium nitride on a sapphire substrate. The unique capability to confine both optical and acoustic fields in sub -wavelength scales without suspended structures allows efficient acoustooptic interactions over long distances under high driving power. This leads to the complete optical conversion with integrated acousto-optic modulators. With the unidirectional phase matching, we also demonstrate the non -reciprocal propagation of optical fields with isolation ratios above 10 dB. This work provides a robust and efficient acousto-optic platform, opening new opportunities for optical signal processing, quantum transduction, and non-magnetic optical isolation.

TI MoSe2/WS2 heterojunction photodiode integrated
   with a silicon nitride waveguide for near infrared light detection with
   high responsivity
SO LIGHT-SCIENCE & APPLICATIONS
AB We demonstrate experimentally the realization and the characterization of a chip-scale integrated photodetector for the near-infrared spectral regime based on the integration of a MoSe2/WS2 heterojunction on top of a silicon nitride waveguide. This configuration achieves high responsivity of similar to 1 A W-1 at the wavelength of 780 nm (indicating an internal gain mechanism) while suppressing the dark current to the level of similar to 50 pA, much lower as compared to a reference sample of just MoSe2 without WS2. We have measured the power spectral density of the dark current to be as low as similar to 1 x 10(-12)A Hz(-0.5), from which we extract the noise equivalent power (NEP) to be similar to 1 x 10(-12) W Hz(-0.5). To demonstrate the usefulness of the device, we use it for the characterization of the transfer function of a microring resonator that is integrated on the same chip as the photodetector. The ability to integrate local photodetectors on a chip and to operate such devices with high performance at the near-infrared regime is expected to play a critical role in future integrated devices in the field of optical communications, quantum photonics, biochemical sensing, and more.

TI Slice-wise initial state optimization to improve cost and accuracy of
   the VQE on lattice models
SO PHYSICA SCRIPTA
AB We propose an optimization method for the Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) that combines adaptive and physics-inspired ansatz design. Instead of optimizing multiple layers simultaneously, the ansatz is built incrementally from its operator subsets, enabling subspace optimization that provides better initialization for subsequent steps. This quasi-dynamical approach preserves expressivity and hardware efficiency while avoiding the overhead of operator selection associated with adaptive methods. Benchmarks on one- and two-dimensional Heisenberg and Hubbard models with up to 20 qubits show improved fidelities, reduced function evaluations, or both, compared to fixed-layer VQE. The method is simple, cost-effective, and particularly well-suited for current noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices.

TI Shot noise signatures of candidate states for the fractional quantum
   Hall ν=125 state
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
AB Fractional quantum Hall (FQH) states are highly sought after because of their ability to host non-Abelian anyons, whose braiding statistics make them excellent candidates for qubits in topological quantum computing. Multiple theoretical studies on the nu = 125 FQH state predict various quasiparticle states hosted by the 125 plateau, which include Z3 parafermions and Majorana modes. In this work, we provide a systematic protocol to distinguish among four possible candidate wavefunctions of the 125 plateau using zero-frequency shot noise experiments on a filter geometry. Qualitative comparisons of Fano factors provide a robust way to predict the candidate state across both the full and partial thermal equilibration regimes without prior knowledge of the experimental information, such as thermal equilibration length, allowing for more realistic experiments.

TI Quantum optimal control of multilevel dissipative quantum systems with

SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Manipulation and control of the complex quantum system with high precision are essential for achieving universal fault-tolerant quantum computing. For a physical system with restricted control resources, it is a challenge to control the dynamics of the target system efficiently and precisely under disturbances. Here we propose a multilevel dissipative quantum control framework and show that deep reinforcement learning provides an efficient way to identify the optimal strategies with restricted control parameters of the complex quantum system. This framework can be generalized to be applied to other quantum control models. Compared with the traditional optimal control method, this deep reinforcement learning algorithm can realize efficient and precise control for multilevel quantum systems with different types of disturbances.

CL Salt Lake City, UT
AB The Number-Theory Transform (NTT) is an important operation used in many lattice-based public-key cryptosystems and, more generally, cryptographic protocols. Polynomial multiplication in quotient polynomial rings is often the most expensive computation in lattice-based public-key cryptosystems, including the current standard, Crystals-Kyber, and many other recently proposed schemes. NTT-based polynomial multiplication significantly improves runtime and yet remains the most expensive operation. Thus, optimizations and improvements are desirable, especially for implementation on resource-constrained devices.
   In this paper we study the problem of a resource-constrained client delegating NTT computations to a single, computationally stronger, server, possibly implemented in a cloud-based architecture. We show several protocols for a client to delegate single/batch computations of the NTT and NTT-1 functions, in input scenarios where the input polynomial(s) are private or public, where the online client runtime is smaller than non-delegated NTT or NTT-1 computation. The improvements are of asymptotic nature, for a large range of the involved parameters, and are noticeable for practical parameter settings. Our implementation can achieve one-order-of-magnitude improvements for NTT computations, and manages to improve the client online runtime for the algorithms in the already significantly optimized Crystals-Kyber cryptosystem.

TI Amortized Efficient zk-SNARK from Linear-Only RLWE Encodings
SO JOURNAL OF COMMUNICATIONS AND NETWORKS
AB This paper addresses a new lattice-based designated zk-SNARK having the smallest proof size in the amortized sense, from the linear-only ring learning with the error (RLWE) encodings. We first generalize a quadratic arithmetic programming (QAP) over a finite field to a ring-variant over a polynomial ring Z(p) [X]/(X (N) + 1) with a power of two N. Then, we propose a zk-SNARK over this ring with a linear-only encoding assumption on RLWE encodings. From the ring isomorphism Z(p) [X]/(X (N) + 1) congruent to Z (N) p , the proposed scheme packs multiple messages from Z(p) , resulting in much smaller amortized proof size compared to previous works. In addition, we present a refined analysis on the noise flooding technique based on the Hellinger divergence instead of the conventional statistical distance, which reduces the size of a proof. In particular, our proof size is 276.5 KB and the amortized proof size is only 156 bytes since our protocol allows to batch N proofs into a single proof. Therefore, we achieve the smallest amortized proof size in the category of lattice-based zk-SNARKs and comparable proof size in the (pre-quantum) zk-SNARKs category.

TI The Latticed-Based Path Privacy Protection Aggregation Scheme for

SO IEEE ACCESS
AB With the occurrence of information leakage events of online ride-hailing, the information security of Internet of Vehicles has been highly valued by the society. Once the information of the Internet of Vehicles is exposed by the online ride-hailing platform or stolen by hackers, it will pose a fatal threat to the personal and property safety of users, and even cause a major information security accident to the whole society. Based on a post-quantum cryptography system, this paper proposes a practical privacy protection scheme for ride-hailing route information, which can present the complete statistical aggregation operation of the route and the frequency from the starting point to the destination without the visibility of the ride-hailing platform, and ensure the data privacy security of a single vehicle. Compared with representative multi-vehicle aggregation solutions, we not only guarantee message privacy, confidentiality, integrity, forward and backward security, anti-man in attack and anti-redial attack, but also achieve multi-dimensional aggregation, CCA security and anti-quantum attack. Through the analysis of the experiment, the cost of our scheme is reasonable. Therefore, the scheme is more practical in this scenario.

TI IRONWOOD META KEY AGREEMENT AND AUTHENTICATION PROTOCOL
SO ADVANCES IN MATHEMATICS OF COMMUNICATIONS
AB Number theoretic public-key solutions, currently used in many applications worldwide, will be subject to various quantum attacks, making them less attractive for longer-term use. Certain group theoretic constructs are now showing promise in providing quantum-resistant cryptographic primitives, and may provide suitable alternatives for those looking to address known quantum attacks. In this paper, we introduce a new protocol called a Meta Key Agreement and Authentication Protocol (MKAAP) that has some characteristics of a public-key solution and some of a shared-key solution. Specifically, it has the deployment benefits of a public-key system, allowing two entities that have never met before to authenticate without requiring real-time access to a third-party, but does require secure provisioning of key material from a trusted key distribution system (similar to a symmetric system) prior to deployment. We then describe a specific MKAAP instance, the Ironwood MKAAP, discuss its security, and show how it resists certain quantum attacks such as Shor's algorithm or Grover's quantum search algorithm. We also show Ironwood implemented on several \internet of things" (IoT devices), measure its performance, and show how it performs significantly better than ECC using fewer device resources.

TI Coupling a Single Trapped Atom to a Whispering-Gallery-Mode
   Microresonator
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB We demonstrate trapping of a single Rb-85 atom at a distance of about 200 nm from the surface of a whispering-gallery-mode bottle microresonator. The atom is trapped in an optical potential, which is created by retroreflecting a red-detuned focused laser beam from the resonator surface. We counteract the trap-induced light shift of the atomic transition frequency by superposing a second laser beam. This allows us to observe a vacuum Rabi splitting in the excitation spectrum of the coupled atom-resonator system. This first demonstration of stable and controlled interaction of a single atom with a whispering-gallery mode in the strong coupling regime opens up the route toward the implementation of quantum protocols and applications that harvest the chiral atom-light coupling present in this class of resonators.

TI Maximum entanglement of mixed symmetric states under unitary
   transformations
SO SCIPOST PHYSICS
AB We study the maximum entanglement that can be produced by a global unitary transformation for systems of two and three qubits constrained to the fully symmetric states. This restriction to the symmetric subspace appears naturally in the context of bosonic or collective spin systems. We also study the symmetric states that remain separable after any global unitary transformation, called symmetric absolutely separable (SAS) states, or absolutely classical for spin states. The results for the two-qubit system are deduced analytically. In particular, we determine the maximal radius of a ball of SAS states around the maximally mixed state in the symmetric sector, and the minimal radius of a ball that contains the set of SAS states. As an application of our results, we also analyse the temperature dependence of the maximum entanglement that can be obtained from the thermal state of a spin-1 system with a spin-squeezing Hamiltonian. For the symmetric three-qubit case, our results are mostly numerical, and we conjecture a 3-parameter family of states that achieves the maximum negativity in the unitary orbit of any mixed state. In addition, we derive upper bounds, apparently tight, on the radii of balls containing only/all SAS states.

TI Quantum deleting and cloning in a pseudo-unitary system
SO FRONTIERS OF PHYSICS
AB In conventional quantum mechanics, quantum no-deleting and no-cloning theorems indicate that two different and nonorthogonal states cannot be perfectly and deterministically deleted and cloned, respectively. Here, we investigate the quantum deleting and cloning in a pseudo-unitary system. We first present a pseudo-Hermitian Hamiltonian with real eigenvalues in a two-qubit system. By using the pseudo-unitary operators generated from this pseudo-Hermitian Hamiltonian, we show that it is possible to delete and clone a class of two different and nonorthogonal states, and it can be generalized to arbitrary two different and nonorthogonal pure qubit states. Furthermore, state discrimination, which is strongly related to quantum no-cloning theorem, is also discussed. Last but not least, we simulate the pseudo-unitary operators in conventional quantum mechanics with post-selection, and obtain the success probability of simulations. Pseudo-unitary operators are implemented with a limited efficiency due to the post-selections. Thus, the success probabilities of deleting and cloning in the simulation by conventional quantum mechanics are less than unity, which maintain the quantum no-deleting and no-cloning theorems.

AB In this paper, we propose an innovative integration of Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) and Blockchain-based Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI) within the Open RAN (O-RAN) framework for 6G networks to address the critical need for enhanced security and robust identity management. We first present a general architecture that takes a multi-layered approach and is carefully designed to leverage the different capabilities of quantum security and blockchain technology. The architecture ensures seamless and secure operation across different layers of the O-RAN, focusing on the Distributed Identity Management (DIM) and Management & Orchestration layers, and explains the interactions between these layers to improve the security and operational efficiency of the network. We also investigate detailed case studies and applications that demonstrate the practicality and transformative potential of integrating QKD-secured blockchain identity management systems in real-world 6G scenarios. We also address the inherent challenges and limitations of such integration and propose viable solutions to overcome them. Finally, we provide insights into future research and implementation directions and highlight the critical role of quantum-secured blockchain systems in the evolution of telecommunication networks toward a more secure, decentralized, and user-centric paradigm.

TI Upper bounds on the leakage of private data and an operational approach
   to Markovianity
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB We quantify the consequences of a private key leakage and private randomness generated during quantum key distribution. We provide simple lower bounds on the one-way distillable key after the leakage has been detected. We also show that the distributed private randomness does not drop by more than twice the number of qubits of the traced-out system. We further focus on irreducible private states, showing that their two-way distillable key is nonlockable. We then strengthen this result by referring to the idea of recovery maps. We further consider the action of a special case of side channels on some of the private states. Finally, we connect the topic of (non-)Markovian dynamics with that of hacking. In particular, we show that an invertible map is non-CP-divisible if and only if there exists a state whose the key witnessed by a particular privacy witness increases in time. This complements the recent result of J. Kolodyn ' ski et al. [Phys. Rev. A 101, 020303(R) (2020)] where the log-negativity was connected with the (non-)Markovianity of the dynamics.

TI Spin-crossover and high magnetic anisotropy in organometallic
   structures: W3C6O6 and Re3C6O6
SO MATERIALS TODAY COMMUNICATIONS
AB Organometallic monolayers of the form TM3C6O6 where TM is any possible transition metal are a very promising material class. Some members of this family with 3d transition metals had been synthesized on noble metal surfaces and we extend here the study to two metals, Tungsten (W) and Rhenium (Re), of the 5d series by the use of ab-initio calculations. One of the key findings is the discovery of spin-crossover behavior in both monolayers. Especially interesting is the spin-crossover behavior of Re3C6O6 which exhibits a transition from intermediate- spin (semiconducting) to high-spin (metallic) states, leading to a significant change in the bandgap, affecting its electrical behavior. In W3C6O6, a small gap in the electronic band structure has been observed. Furthermore, a remarkable high magnetic anisotropy energy has been found in these organometallics with 5d transition metals. Besides the ab-initio energy differences, also the parameters of a Heisenberg model with local anisotropy energies have been determined. The presence of high magnetic anisotropy energies in these organometallics makes them beneficial for potential technological applications, particularly in magnetic storage, spintronics, and other magnetic-based technologies. The high magnetic anisotropy also holds promise for quantum computing, where stable and robust magnetic qubits are essential for information storage and manipulation. Additionally, these materials with high magnetic anisotropy energies are of great interest in fundamental research as they can provide valuable insights into the underlying magnetic interactions and electronic structure of the compounds. In summary, our study highlights the fascinating properties of TM3C6O6 organometallics, with implications for future technologies, quantum computing, and fundamental research in the field of magnetic materials. Furthermore, the discovery of spin-crossover behavior of these materials opens up exciting possibilities for their use in future technologies and epitaxy on different substrates.

TI Cropland suitability assessment evolution and outlooks
SO DISCOVER SUSTAINABILITY
AB Global population growth and accelerated urbanization have triggered a sharp decline in cropland quantity coupled with progressive degradation of its quality. Scientifically and rationally evaluating land suitability has thus emerged as a pressing issue demanding immediate attention, providing critical foundations for sustainable utilization and conservation of arable resources. This study employs a literature review and inductive-deductive approaches to trace the historical development, mainstream frameworks, and assessment methodologies of cropland suitability assessment. Furthermore, against the backdrop of technological transformation, it examines how emerging technologies such as artificial intelligence and blockchain can be effectively integrated into the cropland suitability assessment process. It is found that (1) due to the evolution of social, economic, technological, and ideological conditions caused by the continuous development of history, the evaluation of the suitability of cropland presents stage characteristics, gradually developing from the initial phase dominated by experience to the phase of spatiotemporal data-driven and intelligence; and (2) in the past, the assessment framework of cropland suitability was mostly constructed based on natural factors such as soil properties, topography, climate, etc., and socio-economic factors such as the construction of farmland infrastructure and the accessibility of transportation networks were not sufficiently considered. Cropland suitability assessment methods are more and more diversified, scientific, and objective; among them, the multi-criteria decision-making method is the most widely used. (3) In the context of intelligence, the future of cropland suitability assessment should follow the development guideline of combination, union, and integration and actively guide the attempted exploration of blockchains, quantum computing, and other emerging technologies in the field so as to promote the innovative development of cropland suitability assessment. This paper not only makes up for the lack of comprehensive research in the field of cropland suitability assessment at the theoretical level but also, more importantly, points out the potential direction and entry point for future related research.

TI Exploring Parallelism to Improve the Performance of FrodoKEM in Hardware
SO JOURNAL OF CRYPTOGRAPHIC ENGINEERING
AB FrodoKEM is a lattice-based key encapsulation mechanism, currently a semi-finalist in NIST's post-quantum standardisation effort. A condition for these candidates is to use NIST standards for sources of randomness (i.e. seed-expanding), and as such most candidates utilise SHAKE, an XOF defined in the SHA-3 standard. However, for many of the candidates, this module is a significant implementation bottleneck. Trivium is a lightweight, ISO standard stream cipher which performs well in hardware and has been used in previous hardware designs for lattice-based cryptography. This research proposes optimised designs for FrodoKEM, concentrating on high throughput by parallelising the matrix multiplication operations within the cryptographic scheme. This process is eased by the use of Trivium due to its higher throughput and lower area consumption. The parallelisations proposed also complement the addition of first-order masking to the decapsulation module. Overall, we significantly increase the throughput of FrodoKEM; for encapsulation we see a 16x speed-up, achieving 825 operations per second, and for decapsulation we see a 14x speed-up, achieving 763 operations per second, compared to the previous state of the art, whilst also maintaining a similar FPGA area footprint of less than 2000 slices.

SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB On-chip demagnetization refrigeration has recently emerged as a powerful tool for reaching microkelvin electron temperatures in nanoscale structures. The relative importance of cooling on-chip and off-chip components and the thermal subsystem dynamics are yet to be analyzed. We study a Coulomb blockade thermometer with on-chip copper refrigerant both experimentally and numerically, showing that dynamics in this device are captured by a first-principles model. Our work shows how to simulate thermal dynamics in devices down to microkelvin temperatures, and outlines a recipe for a low-investment platform for quantum technologies and fundamental nanoscience in this novel temperature range.

TI Optical Indistinguishability via Twinning Fields
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB Here we introduce the concept of the twinning field-a driving electromagnetic pulse that induces an identical optical response from two distinct materials. We show that for a large class of pairs of generic many-body systems, a twinning field which renders the systems optically indistinguishable exists. The conditions under which this field exists are derived, and this analysis is supplemented by numerical calculations of twinning fields for both the 1D Fermi-Hubbard model, and tight-binding models of graphene and hexagonal boron nitride. The existence of twinning fields may lead to new research directions in nonlinear optics, materials science, and quantum technologies.

TI Driven dissipative quantum dynamics in a cavity magnon-polariton system
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
AB The dynamics of arbitrary-order quantum correlations in a cavity magnon-polariton system are investigated based on the quantum master equation in the coherent state representation. The phenomena of Rabi-like oscillation and level repulsion of the average cavity-photon number agree remarkably well with existing experimental observations. The competing nature of coherent and incoherent components in these two cases is further revealed by the second-order quantum coherence of the cavity photons and magnons, which can be systematically tuned by the driving microwave and thermal bath. Our results demonstrate the rich higher-order quantum dynamics induced by magnetic light-matter interaction and serve as an indispensable step toward exploring nonclassical states for cavity photons and magnons in quantum cavity magnonics.

TI Chemiexcitation in preventing macular degeneration
SO FRONTIERS IN PHOTONICS
AB Quantum biology typically involves light exciting an electron to a higher energy state, or a magnetic field splitting a single state into several having different energies, or tunneling to flout the energy barrier between states. In chemiexcitation, electrons reach an excited state without light. A ground-state chemical reaction creates a reaction product born in the excited state, due to transient mixing between ground- and excited-state wavefunctions when the reaction intermediate molecule is twisted. We outline the chemiexcitation process and its biological triggers, describe the distinctive molecules susceptible to chemiexcitation, and review recent evidence that melanin in the human retina is chemiexcited as a strategy to prevent age-related macular degeneration.

TI Quantifying quantumness in three-flavor neutrino oscillations

AB We characterize quantum correlations encoded in a three-flavor oscillating neutrino system by using both plane-wave and wave-packet approach. By means of the Complete Complementarity Relations (CCR) we study the trade-off of predictability, local coherence and non-local correlations in terms of the relevant parameters, chosen from recent neutrino experiments. Although the CCR describe very well the contributions associated to bipartite correlations, an attempt of promoting these relations to include the genuine tri-partite contributions in the pure-state case leads to a not completely meaningful result. However, we provide an analysis of the genuine tripartite contributions both for the pure instance and for the mixed case, independently of CCR.

Despite that, a demonstration of time-frequency entanglement over a broad spectral width is still lacking. Here we present an efficient source of ultrabroadband entangled photon pairs on a periodically poled lithium niobate nanophotonic waveguide. Employing dispersion engineering, we demonstrate a record-high 100 THz (1.2 mu m-2 mu m) generation bandwidth with a high efficiency of 13 GHz/mW and excellent noise performance with the coincidence-to-accidental ratio exceeding 10(5). We also measure strong time-frequency entanglement with over 98% two-photon interference visibility.

TI Modeling of planar germanium hole qubits in electric and magnetic fields
SO NPJ QUANTUM INFORMATION
AB Hole-based spin qubits in strained planar germanium quantum wells have received considerable attention due to their favorable properties and remarkable experimental progress. The sizeable spin-orbit interaction in this structure allows for efficient qubit operations with electric fields. However, it also couples the qubit to electrical noise. In this work, we perform simulations of a heterostructure hosting these hole spin qubits. We solve the effective mass equations for a realistic heterostructure, provide a set of analytical basis wavefunctions, and compute the effective g-factor of the heavy-hole ground state. Our investigations reveal a strong impact of highly excited light-hole states located outside the quantum well on the g-factor. We find that sweet spots, points of operations that are least susceptible to charge noise, for out-of-plane magnetic fields are shifted to impractically large electric fields. However, for magnetic fields close to in-plane alignment, partial sweet spots at low electric fields are recovered. Furthermore, sweet spots with respect to multiple fluctuating charge traps can be found under certain circumstances for different magnetic field alignments. This work will be helpful in understanding and improving the coherence of germanium hole spin qubits.

AB The complexity of computing the solutions of a system of multivariate polynomial equations by means of Grobner bases computations is upper bounded by a function of the solving degree. In this paper, we discuss how to rigorously estimate the solving degree of a system, focusing on systems arising within public-key cryptography. In particular, we show that it is upper bounded by, and often equal to, the Castelnuovo-Mumford regularity of the ideal generated by the homogenization of the equations of the system, or by the equations themselves in case they are homogeneous. We discuss the underlying commutative algebra and clarify under which assumptions the commonly used results hold. In particular, we discuss the assumption of being in generic coordinates (often required for bounds obtained following this type of approach) and prove that systems that contain the field equations or their fake Weil descent are in generic coordinates. We also compare the notion of solving degree with that of degree of regularity, which is commonly used in the literature. We complement the paper with some examples of bounds obtained following the strategy that we describe.

TI Solving the Problem of Blockwise Isomorphism of Polynomials with
   Circulant Matrices
SO IEICE TRANSACTIONS ON FUNDAMENTALS OF ELECTRONICS COMMUNICATIONS AND
   COMPUTER SCIENCES
AB The problem of Isomorphism of Polynomials (IP problem) is known to be important to study the security of multivariate public key cryptosystems, one of the major candidates of post-quantum cryptography, against key recovery attacks. In these years, several schemes based on the IP problem itself or its generalization have been proposed. At PQCrypto 2020, Santoso introduced a generalization of the problem of Isomorphism of Polynomials, called the problem of Blockwise Isomorphism of Polynomials (BIP problem), and proposed a new Diffie-Hellman type encryption scheme based on this problem with Circulant matrices (BIPC problem). Quite recently, Ikematsu et al. proposed an attack called the linear stack attack to recover an equivalent key of Santoso's encryption scheme. While this attack reduced the security of the scheme, it does not contribute to solving the BIPC problem itself. In the present paper, we describe how to solve the BIPC problem directly by simplifying the BIPC problem due to the conjugation property of circulant matrices. In fact, we experimentally solved the BIPC problem with the parameter, which has 256 bit security by Santoso's security analysis and has 72.7 bit security against the linear stack attack, by about 10 minutes.

TI Recent progress in the security evaluation of multivariate public-key
   cryptography
SO IET INFORMATION SECURITY
AB Multivariate public-key cryptography (MPKC) is considered a leading candidate for post-quantum cryptography (PQC). It is based on the hardness of the multivariate quadratic polynomial (MQ) problem, which is a problem of finding a solution to a system of quadratic equations over a finite field. In this paper, we survey some recent progress in the security analysis of MPKC. Among various existing multivariate schemes, the most important one is the Rainbow signature scheme proposed by Ding et al. in 2005, which was later selected as a finalist in the third round of the PQC standardization project by the National Institute of Standards and Technology. Under the circumstances, some recent research studies in MPKC have focussed on the security analysis of the Rainbow scheme. In this paper, the authors first explain efficient algorithms for solving the MQ problem and the research methodology for estimating their complexity in MPKC. Then, the authors survey some recent results related to the security analysis of the Rainbow scheme. In particular, the authors provide a detailed description of the complexity analysis for solving the bi-graded polynomial systems studied independently by Nakamura et al. and Smith-Tone et al., and then expound the rectangular MinRank attack against Rainbow proposed by Beullens.

TI Quantum Speed-Ups for String Synchronizing Sets, Longest Common
   Substring, and k-mismatch Matching
SO ACM TRANSACTIONS ON ALGORITHMS
AB Longest common substring (LCS) is an important text processing problem, which has recently been investigated in the quantum query model. The decision version of this problem, LCS with threshold d, asks whether two length-n input strings have a common substring of length d. The two extreme cases, d=1 and d=n, correspond, respectively to Element Distinctness and Unstructured Search, two fundamental problems in quantum query complexity. However, the intermediate case 1 << d << n was not fully understood. We show that the complexity of LCS with threshold d smoothly interpolates between the two extreme cases up to no(1) factors: -LCS with threshold d has a quantum algorithm in n(2/3+o(1))/d(1/6) query complexity and time complexity, and requires at least Omega(n(2/3)/d(1/6)) quantum query complexity. Our result improves upon previous upper bounds O(min{n/d(1/2),n(2/3)}) (Le Gall and Seddighin ITCS 2022, Akmal and Jin SODA 2022), and answers an open question of Akmal and Jin. Our main technical contribution is a quantum speed-up of the powerful String Synchronizing Set technique introduced by Kempa and Kociumaka (STOC 2019). It consistently samples n/tau 1-o(1) synchronizing positions in the string depending on their length-Theta(tau) contexts, and each synchronizing position can be reported by a quantum algorithm in O(tau(1/2+o(1))) time. Our quantum string synchronizing set also yields a near-optimal LCE data structure in the quantum setting. As another application of our quantum string synchronizing set, we study the k -mismatch Matching problem, which asks if the pattern has an occurrence in the text with at most k Hamming mismatches. Using a structural result of Charalampopoulos et al. (FOCS 2020), we obtain: -k-mismatch matching has a quantum algorithm with k(3/4)n(1/2+o(1)) query complexity and O(kn(1/2)) time complexity. We also observe a non-matching quantum query lower bound of Omega(root kn).

TI Encoding the Enforcement of Safety Standards into Smart Robots to
   Harness Their Computing Sophistication and Collaborative Potential: A
   Legal Risk Assessment for European Union Policymakers
SO EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF RISK REGULATION
AB Until robots and humans mostly worked in fast-paced and yet separate environments, occupational health and safety (OHS) rules could address workers' safety largely independently from robotic conduct. This is no longer the case: collaborative robots (cobots) working alongside humans warrant the design of policies ensuring the safety of both humans and robots at once, within shared spaces and upon delivery of cooperative workflows. Within the European Union (EU), the applicable regulatory framework stands at the intersection between international industry standards and legislation at the EU as well as Member State level. Not only do current standards and laws fail to satisfactorily attend to the physical and mental health challenges prompted by human-robot interaction (HRI), but they exhibit important gaps in relation to smart cobots ("SmaCobs") more specifically. In fact, SmaCobs combine the black-box unforeseeability afforded by machine learning with more general HRI-associated risks, towards increasingly complex, mobile and interconnected operational interfaces and production chains. Against this backdrop, based on productivity and health motivations, we urge the encoding of the enforcement of OHS policies directly into SmaCobs. First, SmaCobs could harness the sophistication of quantum computing to adapt a tangled normative architecture in a responsive manner to the contingent needs of each situation. Second, entrusting them with OHS enforcement vis-a-vis both themselves and humans may paradoxically prove safer as well as more cost-effective than for humans to do so. This scenario raises profound legal, ethical and somewhat philosophical concerns around SmaCobs' legal personality, the apportionment of liability and algorithmic explainability. The first systematic proposal to tackle such questions is henceforth formulated. For the EU, we propose that this is achieved through a new binding OHS Regulation aimed at the SmaCobs age.

TI A numerical investigation of electronic, optical, mechanical and
   thermodynamic interaction of Lu based Half-Heusler alloy topological
   insulators
SO NEXT MATERIALS
AB Topological Insulators promise for revolutionizing quantum computing and spintronics due to their protected metallic surface channels and unique dissipationless, however, exploration of novel composition is crucial in this field. This study investigates the characteristics of Lutetium (Lu)-based Half-Heusler alloys (LuPtBi, LuPdSb, LuAuPb, and LuAuSn) using Density Functional Theory(DFT): CASTEP calculations. The band structure exhibited band inversion and the DOS indicated substantial spin-orbit coupling both in GGA-PBE and DFT+U methods. Significant absorption peaks at 7.34 eV, 10.22 eV, 6.65 eV, and 8.72 eV, and reflectivity peaks at 1.51 eV, 10.78 eV, 1.2 eV, and 2.14 eV were found in LuPtBi, LuPdSb, LuAuPb, and LuAuSn, respectively. The refractive indices were calculated as 5.25 (LuPtBi), 5.49 (LuPdSb), 6.05 (LuAuPb), and 5.38 (LuAuSn) at the visible region. Optical conductivity has been computed as 7.08, 6.85, 6.92 and 6.56 (1/fs) at 5.58 eV, 6.65 eV, 1.51 eV, and 2.39 eV, respectively. High dielectric constants and absorption peaks at lower energies emphasize their optoelectronic and photovoltaic applications. Mechanical testing demonstrates stability and modest ductility. LuPdSb, with the highest bulk modulus, is ideal for high pressure applications, whereas LuAuSn, with the highest shear modulus, shines under torsional loads. LuPdSb (127.86 GPa) and LuAuSn (128.34 GPa) have the largest Young's moduli, although LuPtBi has the greatest lateral deformation. Thermodynamic analysis revealed that LuPdSb has the highest Debye temperature (261.03 K) and sound velocity (2504.66 m/s), indicating strong interatomic bonding, efficient phonon propagation, and high thermal stability. Lu-based Half-Heusler alloys are therefore intriguing for energy efficient applications, quantum computing, photonics, and next-generation spintronics.

TI Enhanced Spectral Tunability by Sub-10 nm Nanogaps in Graphene-Metal
   Hybrid Metasurfaces
SO ADVANCED SCIENCE
AB Electrically tunable graphene-metal metasurfaces have emerged as a promising platform for precise control of free-space light propagation. However, their resonance tuning range is limited by fabrication constraints, particularly by the achievable gap size between coupled antennas, which is the parameter that influences the device's performance most. In this work, this challenge is addressed by introducing a novel fabrication approach that combines traditional e-beam lithography with physical vapor deposition of an additional thin metal layer and subsequent ion milling. Incorporating an Al2O3 etch-stop layer allows to overcome the approximate to 20 nm gap size limitation of conventional methods. Using this approach sub-10 nm gaps can be fabricated reliably and the tuning range of metasurfaces operating in the mid-infrared is increased from 0.50 to 0.77 mu m, together with an enhancement in the maximum modulation depth from 45% to 59%. The better performance is attributed to stronger field enhancement in the reduced nanogap. This work is a critical step toward widely tunable mid-infrared metasurfaces, with potential applications in spatial light modulators, surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy, and quantum photonics.

TI Deep Learning for Forecasting-Based Applications in Cyber-Physical
   Microgrids: Recent Advances and Future Directions
SO ELECTRONICS
AB Renewable energy resources can be deployed locally and efficiently using the concept of microgrids. Due to the natural uncertainty of the output power of renewable energy resources, the planning for a proper operation of microgrids can be a challenging task. In addition, the information about the loads and the power consumption of them can create benefits to increase the efficiency of the microgrids. However, electrical loads can have uncertainty due to reasons such as unpredictable behavior of the consumers. To exploit a microgrid, energy management is required at the upper level of operation and control in order to reduce the costs. One of the most important tasks of the energy management system is to satisfy the loads and, in other words, develop a plan to maintain equilibrium between the power generation and power consumption. To obtain information about the output power of renewable energy resources and power consumption, deep learning can be implemented as a powerful tool, which is able to predict the desired values. In addition, weather conditions can affect the output power of renewable energy-based resources and the behavior of the consumers and, as a result, the power consumption. So, deep learning can be deployed for the anticipation of the weather conditions. This paper will study the recent works related to deep learning, which has been implemented for the prediction of the output power of renewable energy resources (i.e., PVs and wind turbines), electrical loads, and weather conditions (i.e., solar irradiance and wind speed). In addition, for possible future directions some strategies are suggested, the most important of which is the implementation of quantum computing in cyber-physical microgrids.

TI Artificial Intelligence in Maritime Cybersecurity: A Systematic Review
   of AI-Driven Threat Detection and Risk Mitigation Strategies
SO ELECTRONICS
AB The maritime industry is undergoing a digital transformation, integrating automation, artificial intelligence (AI), and the Internet of Things (IoT) to enhance operational efficiency and safety. However, this technological evolution has also increased cybersecurity vulnerabilities, exposing vessels, ports, and maritime communication networks to sophisticated cyber threats. This systematic review, conducted following the PRISMA guidelines, examines the current landscape of AI-driven cybersecurity solutions in maritime environments. By analyzing peer-reviewed studies and industry reports, this review identifies key AI methodologies, including machine-learning-based intrusion detection systems, anomaly detection mechanisms, predictive threat modeling, and AI-enhanced zero-trust architectures. This study assesses the effectiveness of these techniques in mitigating cyber risks, explores their implementation challenges, and highlights existing research gaps. The findings indicate that AI-powered solutions significantly enhance real-time threat detection and response capabilities in maritime networks, yet issues such as data scarcity, regulatory constraints, and adversarial attacks on AI models remain unresolved. Future research directions should focus on integrating AI with blockchain, federated learning, and quantum cryptographic techniques to strengthen maritime cybersecurity frameworks.

TI Extended version-to be, or not to be stateful: post-quantum secure boot
   using hash-based signatures
SO JOURNAL OF CRYPTOGRAPHIC ENGINEERING
AB While research in PQC has gained significant momentum, its adoption in real-world products is slow. This is largely due to concerns about practicability and maturity. The secure boot process of embedded devices is one scenario where such restraints can result in fundamental security problems. In this work, we present a flexible hardware/software co-design for HBS schemes which enables the transition to a post-quantum secure boot today. These signature schemes stand out due to their straightforward security proofs and are on the fast track to standardisation. Unlike previous work, we exploit the performance intensive similarities of the stateful LMS and XMSS schemes as well as the stateless SPHINCS+ scheme. Thus, we enable designers to use a stateful or stateless scheme depending on the constraints of each individual application. To demonstrate the feasibility of our approach, we compare our results with hardware accelerated implementations of classical asymmetric algorithms. Further, we outline the use of different HBS schemes during the boot process. We compare different schemes, show the importance of parameter choices, and demonstrate the performance gain with different levels of hardware acceleration.

TI Pre-trained quantum convolutional neural network for COVID-19 disease
   classification using computed tomography images
SO PEERJ COMPUTER SCIENCE
AB Background. The COVID-19 pandemic has had a significant influence on economies and healthcare systems around the globe. One of the most important strategies that has proven to be effective in limiting the disease and reducing its rapid spread is early detection and quick isolation of infections. Several diagnostic tools are currently being used for COVID-19 detection using computed tomography (CT) scan and chest X-ray (CXR) images. Methods. In this study, a novel deep learning-based model is proposed for rapid detection of COVID-19 using CT-scan images. The model, called pre-trained quantum convolutional neural network (QCNN), seamlessly combines the strength of quantum computing with the feature extraction capabilities of a pre-trained convolutional neural network (CNN), particularly VGG16. By combining the robust feature learning of classical models with the complex data handling of quantum computing, the combination of QCNN and the pre-trained VGG16 model improves the accuracy of feature extraction and classification, which is the significance of the proposed model compared to classical and quantum-based models in previous works. Results. The QCNN model was tested on a SARS-CoV-2 CT dataset, initially without any pre-trained models and then with a variety of pre-trained models, such as ResNet50, ResNet18, VGG16, VGG19, and EfficientNetV2L. The results showed the VGG16 model performs the best. The proposed model achieved 96.78% accuracy, 0.9837 precision, 0.9528 recall, 0.9835 specificity, 0.9678 F1-Score and 0.1373 loss. Conclusion. Our study presents pre-trained QCNN models as a viable technique for COVID-19 disease detection, showcasing their effectiveness in reaching higher accuracy and specificity. The current paper adds to the continuous efforts to utilize artificial intelligence to aid healthcare professionals in the diagnosis of COVID-19 patients.

TI Artificial intelligence and machine learning in cybersecurity: a deep
   dive into state-of-the-art techniques and future paradigms
SO KNOWLEDGE AND INFORMATION SYSTEMS
AB The integration of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) into cybersecurity has driven a transformational shift, significantly enhancing the ability to detect, respond to, and mitigate complex cyber threats. Traditional defense mechanisms are increasingly inadequate against sophisticated attacks, necessitating the adoption of AI-driven security solutions. This review paper presents a novel, in-depth analysis of state-of-the-art AI and ML techniques applied to intrusion detection, malware classification, behavioral analysis, and threat intelligence. Unlike existing studies, this work not only synthesizes current advancements but also identifies key limitations and emerging research gaps in AI-powered cybersecurity. A key novelty of this paper lies in its comprehensive evaluation of adversarial defense mechanisms, addressing how AI models can be hardened against adversarial attacks and data manipulation techniques. Additionally, we explore the growing role of federated learning in collaborative threat intelligence, offering privacy-preserving security models that enhance real-time cyber defense across decentralized networks. Another major contribution is our discussion on the integration of AI with quantum computing for cryptographic resilience, as well as its convergence with IoT security, shaping the next generation of adaptive cybersecurity frameworks. Furthermore, this paper proposes a forward-looking roadmap for sustainable AI-driven cybersecurity, emphasizing the need for adaptive adversarial defense systems, federated learning for global threat mitigation, and AI-enhanced cyber resilience frameworks. By bridging the gap between current AI-driven security solutions and future paradigms, this work serves as a valuable resource for researchers, cybersecurity professionals, and policymakers aiming to develop intelligent, scalable, and resilient cybersecurity architectures. While AI and ML are reshaping modern cybersecurity, their effectiveness hinges on continuous innovation, adversarial robustness, and interdisciplinary collaboration to combat an ever-evolving threat landscape.

AB Finding the transient and steady state properties of open quantum systems is a central problem in various fields of quantum technologies. Here, we present a quantum-assisted algorithm to determine the steady states of open system dynamics. By reformulating the problem of finding the fixed point of Lindblad dynamics as a feasibility semidefinite program, we bypass several well-known issues with variational quantum approaches to solving for steady states. We demonstrate that our hybrid approach allows us to estimate the steady states of higher dimensional open quantum systems and discuss how our method can find multiple steady states for systems with symmetries.

TI Artificial Intelligence-Driven and Bio-Inspired Control Strategies for
   Industrial Robotics: A Systematic Review of Trends, Challenges, and
   Sustainable Innovations Toward Industry 5.0
SO MACHINES
AB Industrial robots are undergoing a transformative shift as Artificial Intelligence (AI)-driven and bio-inspired control strategies unlock new levels of precision, adaptability, and multi-dimensional sustainability aligned with Industry 5.0 (energy efficiency, material circularity, and life-cycle emissions). This systematic review analyzes 160 peer-reviewed industrial robotics control studies (2023-2025), including an expanded bio-inspired/human-centric subset, to evaluate: (1) the dominant and emerging control methodologies; (2) the transformative role of digital twins and 5G-enabled connectivity; and (3) the persistent technical, ethical, and environmental challenges. Following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) 2020 guidelines, the study employs a rigorous methodology, focusing on adaptive control, deep reinforcement learning (DRL), human-robot collaboration (HRC), and quantum-inspired algorithms. The key findings highlight up to 30% latency reductions in real-time optimization, up to 22% efficiency gains through digital twins, and up to 25% energy savings from bio-inspired designs (all percentage ranges are reported relative to the comparator baselines specified in the cited sources). However, critical barriers remain, including scalability limitations (with up to 40% higher computational demands) and cybersecurity vulnerabilities (with up to 20% exposure rates). The convergence of AI, bio-inspired systems, and quantum computing is poised to enable sustainable, autonomous, and human-centric robotics, yet requires standardized safety frameworks and hybrid architectures to fully support the transition from Industry 4.0 to Industry 5.0. This review offers a strategic roadmap for future research and industrial adoption, emphasizing human-centric design, ethical frameworks, and circular-economy principles to address global manufacturing challenges.

TI Phase-Controlled Tunable Unconventional Photon Blockade in a
   Single-Atom-Cavity System
SO MICROMACHINES
AB In the past few years, cavity optomechanical systems have received extensive attention and research and have achieved rapid development both theoretically and experimentally. The systems play an important role in many fields, such as quantum information processing, optomechanical storage, high-precision measurement, macroscopic entanglement, ultrasensitive sensors and so on. Photon manipulation has always been one of the key tasks in quantum information science and technology. Photon blockade is an important way to realize single photon sources and plays an important role in the field of quantum information. Due to the nonlinear coupling of the optical force system, the energy level is not harmonic, resulting in a photon blockade effect. In this paper, we study the phase-controlled tunable unconventional photon blockade in a single-atom-cavity system, and the second-order nonlinear crystals are attached to the cavity. The cavity interacts with squeezed light, which results in a nonlinear process. The system is driven by a complex pulsed laser, and the strength of the coherent driving contains the phase. We want to study the effect of squeezed light and phase. We use the second-order correlation function to numerically and theoretically analyze the photon blockade effect. We show that quantum interference of two-photon excitation between three different transition pathways can cause a photon blockade effect. When there is no squeezed light, the interference pathways becomes two, but there are still photon blockade effects. We explore the influence of the tunable phase and second-order nonlinear strength on the photon blockade effect. We calculate the correlation function and compare the numerical results with the analytical results under certain parameters and find that the agreement is better.

TI Development of a New Post-Quantum Digital Signature Algorithm: Syrga-1
SO COMPUTERS
AB The distinguishing feature of hash-based algorithms is their high confidence in security. When designing electronic signature schemes, proofs of security reduction to certain properties of cryptographic hash functions are used. This means that if the scheme is compromised, then one of these properties will be violated. It is important to note that the properties of cryptographic hash functions have been studied for many years, but if a specific hash function used in a protocol turns out to be insecure, it can simply be replaced with another one while keeping the overall construction unchanged. This article describes a new post-quantum signature algorithm, Syrga-1, based on a hash function. This algorithm is designed to sign r messages with a single secret key. One of the key primitives of the signature algorithm is a cryptographic hash function. The proposed algorithm uses the HAS01 hashing algorithm developed by researchers from the Information Security Laboratory of the Institute of Information and Computational Technologies. The security and efficiency of the specified hash algorithm have been demonstrated in other articles by its authors. Hash-based signature schemes are attractive as post-quantum signature schemes because their security can be quantified, and their security has been proven.

TI Optimal control for Hamiltonian parameter estimation in non-commuting
   and bipartite quantum dynamics
SO SCIPOST PHYSICS
AB The ability to characterise a Hamiltonian with high precision is crucial for the implementation of quantum technologies. In addition to the well-developed approaches utilising optimal probe states and optimal measurements, the method of optimal control can be used to identify time-dependent pulses applied to the system to achieve higher precision in the estimation of Hamiltonian parameters, especially in the presence of noise. Here, we extend optimally controlled estimation schemes for single qubits to non-commuting dynamics as well as two interacting qubits, demonstrating improvements in terms of maximal precision, time-stability, as well as robustness over uncontrolled protocols.

TI Design of Horizontally Stacked AlN and Dielectric Cores Transverse
   Quasi-Phase-Matched Channel Waveguide for Squeezed Light Generation
SO PHYSICA STATUS SOLIDI A-APPLICATIONS AND MATERIALS SCIENCE
AB AlN is a promising candidate for photonic integrated circuits. In this study, horizontally stacked transverse quasi-phase-matched (QPM) waveguides with an AlN center core and Si3N4, Ta2O5, and TiO2 side cores were designed to generate squeezed light at 920 nm. The squeezing level was calculated by considering the propagation loss at the wavelengths of the squeezed light and pump light. Using TiO2 for the side cores enhanced the electric field amplitude of the pump light in the AlN center core, and a high nonlinear coupling coefficient was obtained. Owing to the small propagation loss of the AlN waveguide on sapphire and high nonlinear coupling coefficient of the transverse QPM with TiO2 side cores, a squeezing level of over 8.1 dB was expected with a 1 cm long waveguide and pump power of 70 mW.
   In this article, a horizontally stacked transverse quasi-phased-matched waveguide with an AlN center core and dielectric side cores for squeezed light generation is investigated. In calculating the squeezing level, the loss of pump light was considered in addition to the loss of squeezed light. image (c) 2024 WILEY-VCH GmbH

TI Tailoring the properties of quantum dot-micropillars by ultrafast
   optical injection of free charge carriers
SO LIGHT-SCIENCE & APPLICATIONS
AB We review recent studies of cavity switching induced by the optical injection of free carriers in micropillar cavities containing quantum dots. Using the quantum dots as a broadband internal light source and a streak camera as detector, we track the resonance frequencies for a large set of modes with picosecond time resolution. We report a record-fast switch-on time constant (1.5 ps) and observe major transient modifications of the modal structure of the micropillar on the 10 ps time scale: mode crossings are induced by a focused symmetric injection of free carriers, while a lifting of several mode degeneracies is observed when off-axis injection breaks the rotational symmetry of the micropillar. We show theoretically and experimentally that cavity switching can be used to tailor the dynamic properties of the coupled QD-cavity system. We report the generation of ultrashort spontaneous emission pulses (as short as 6 ps duration) by a collection of frequency-selected QDs in a switched pillar microcavity. These pulses display a very small coherence length, attractive for ultrafast speckle-free imaging. Moreover, the control of QD-mode coupling on the 10 ps time scale establishes cavity switching as an appealing resource for quantum photonics.

TI A Robust Image Encryption Scheme Based on Quantum Walks and Dynamic DNA
   for Secure Cloud Applications
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB With the rapid development of cloud-based services, ensuring the confidentiality of image data in cloud environments has become increasingly critical. Furthermore, advances in quantum computing pose a significant threat to traditional cryptosystems, including those used in cloud systems, as they may become vulnerable to quantum-based attacks. This paper presents a robust image encryption approach based on integrating quantum walks, a 4-D hyperchaotic system, and dynamic DNA operations to ensure high security. To enhance sensitivity to the plain image, our encryption algorithm initializes the hyperchaotic system with key parameters, generating chaotic sequences that are used to substitute the plain image. It then extracts information from the initially substituted image to update the binary message that controls the operation of quantum walks while simultaneously updating the initial parameters of the hyperchaotic system. These updated parameters operate both the quantum walks and the hyperchaotic system. The probability distribution generated by the quantum walks is integrated with the chaotic sequences of the hyperchaotic system to permutate the DNA-encoded image sequence, perform dynamic DNA operations, and execute dynamic DNA decoding, thereby increasing complexity and enhancing security. Finally, after decoding, the pixel permutation and substitution processes are applied to produce the final cipher image. Experimental analysis demonstrates that the proposed approach achieves high encryption quality and robust resistance to cryptographic attacks, which makes it suitable for secure cloud-based services. The results show an average correlation coefficient of -0.00007, a Chi-square of 254.26013, NPCR of 99.61238%, UACI of 33.45688%, global entropy of 7.99954, local entropy of 7.90219, PSNR of 7.8537, key space of 10(240), and an encryption speed of 0.1426 megabits per second.

TI A Decentralized Storage and Security Engine (DeSSE) Using Information
   Fusion Based on Stochastic Processes and Quantum Mechanics
SO APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL
AB In the context of data security, this work aims to present a novel solution that, rather than addressing the topic of endpoint security-which has already garnered significant attention within the international scientific community-offers a different perspective on the subject. In other words, the focus is not on device security but rather on the protection and security of the information contained within those devices. As we will see, the result is a next-generation decentralized infrastructure that simultaneously integrates two cognitive areas: data storage and its protection and security. In this context, an innovative Multiscale Relativistic Quantum (MuReQua) chain is considered to realize a novel decentralized and security solution for storing data. This engine is based on the principles of Quantum Mechanics, stochastic processes, and a new approach of decentralization for data storage focused on information security. The solution is broken down into four main components, considered four levels of security against attackers: (i) defocusing, (ii) fogging, (iii) puzzling, and (iv) crypto agility. The defocusing is realized thanks to a fragmentation of the contents and their distributions on different allocations, while the fogging is a component consisting of a solution of hybrid cyphering. Then, the puzzling is a unit of Information Fusion and Inverse Information Fusion, while the crypto agility component is a frontier component based on Quantum Computing, which gives a stochastic dynamic to the information and, in particular, to its data fragments. The data analytics show a very effective and robust solution, with executions time comparable with cloud technologies, but with a level of security that is a post quantum one. In the end, thanks to a specific application example, going beyond purely technical and technological aspects, this work introduces a new cognitive perspective regarding (i) the distinction between data and information, and (ii) the differentiation between the owner and the custodian of data.

For this purpose, laser radiation at 313 nm is necessary which is generated by frequency doubling of 626 nm laser emission. Laser sources in this spectral region lack simplicity and need to be miniaturized. We carry out a systematic improvement of room temperature semiconductor laser structures emitting at 626 nm. They are based on a GaInP single quantum well embedded in AlGaInP grown on GaAs. We first investigate the structure theoretically and determine its limits and optima.

Based on these results, we believe that quantum computing focusing on beryllium ions will highly benefit from these results.

With a growing interest in the representation of quantum states as topological objects, we consider quantum history bundles based on the temporal manifold and show the source of the violation of monogamous temporal Bell-like inequalities. We introduce definitions for the mixture of quantum histories and consider their entanglement as sections over the Hilbert vector bundles. As a generalization of temporal Bell-like inequalities, we derive the quantum bound for multi-time Bell-like inequalities.

TI Modifying quantum optical states by zero-photon subtraction
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB The process of single-photon subtraction (SPS) is known to dramatically alter the properties of certain quantum optical states. Somewhat surprisingly, subtracting zero photons can also modify quantum states and has practical applications in quantum communication. Here we experimentally investigate zero-photon subtraction (ZPS) using a wide variety of input states and conditional measurements based on actively detecting zero photons in one output port of a variable beamsplitter. We find that SPS and ZPS can exhibit complementary behavior depending on the photon statistics of the input states and highlight deeper connections with Mandel's Q parameter for classifying quantum states.

TI Universal control of superexchange in linear triple quantum dots with an
   empty mediator
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
AB Superexchange is one of the vital resources to realize long-range interaction between distant spins for largescale quantum computing. Recent experiments have demonstrated coherent oscillations between logical states defined by remote spins whose coupling is given by the superexchange interaction mediated by central spins. Excavating the potential of superexchange requires a full understanding of the interaction in terms of control parameters, which is still lacking in literature. Here, using full configuration interaction calculations, we study a two-electron system in a linear triple-quantum-dot device in which the left and right dots are occupied by a single electron each, whose spin states are defined as qubits. The numerical nature of the full configuration interaction calculations allows access to the microscopic details of the quantum-dot confining potential and electronic wave functions, some of which are overlooked in the celebrated Hubbard model but turn out to be critical for the behavior of superexchange. Following experimental demonstrations of superexchange interactions, we focus on the detuning regime where the charge ground state yields an empty middle dot. We have found that, when the detunings at the left and right dots are leveled, the superexchange can exhibit a nonmonotonic behavior, which ranges from positive to negative values as a function of the middle-dot detuning. We further show that a larger relative detuning between the left and right dots causes the magnitude of the superexchange to increase (decrease) for an originally positive (negative) superexchange. We then proceed to show the results for a much larger left-right dot detuning. Using a Hubbard-like model, we present analytical expressions of the superexchange and have found that they conform well qualitatively with the numerical results. Our results suggest that even a simple configuration of delocalized two-electron states in a linear triple-quantum-dot device exhibits superexchange energy with nontrivial behaviors, which could have important applications in spin-based quantum computing.

AB Quantum secret sharing (QSS) is a cryptographic protocol in which a quantum secret is distributed among a number of parties where some subsets of the parties are able to recover the secret while some subsets are unable to recover the secret. In the standard ((k, n)) quantum threshold secret sharing scheme, any subset of k or more parties out of the total n parties can recover the secret while other subsets have no information about the secret. But recovery of the secret incurs a communication cost of at least k qudits for every qudit in the secret. Recently, a class of communication efficient QSS schemes were proposed which can improve this communication cost to d/d - K + 1 by contacting d >= k parties where d is fixed prior to the distribution of shares. In this paper, we propose a more general class of ((k, n)) quantum secret sharing schemes with low communication complexity. In these schemes the combiner can contact any d parties at the time of recovery where k <= d <= n. This is the first such class of universal communication efficient quantum threshold schemes.

TI Reservoir-based deterministic loading of single-atom tweezer arrays
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB State-of-the-art individual-atom tweezer platforms have relied on loading schemes based on spatially superimposing the tweezer array with a cloud of cold atoms created beforehand. Together with immanent atom loss, this dramatically limits the data rate, as the application sequence must be alternated with the time-consuming phases of magneto-optical trapping and laser cooling. We introduce a modular scheme built on an additional cold-atom reservoir and an array of buffer traps effectively decoupling cold-atom accumulation and single-atom supply from the quantum-register operation. For this purpose, we connect a microlens-based tweezer array to a cloud of laser-cooled atoms held in an auxiliary large-focus dipole trap by utilizing atom transport and buffer traps for dedicated single-atom supply. We demonstrate deterministic loading of a hexagonal target structure with atoms solely originating from the reservoir trap. The results facilitate increased data rates and unlock a path to continuous operation of individual-atom tweezer arrays in quantum science, making use of discrete functional modules, operated in parallel and spatially separated.

TI An optomechanical platform for quantum hypothesis testing for collapse
   models
SO NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB Quantum hypothesis testing has shown the advantages that quantum resources can offer in the discrimination of competing hypothesis. Here, we apply this framework to optomechanical systems and fundamental physics questions. In particular, we focus on an optomechanical system composed of two cavities employed to perform quantum channel discrimination. We show that input squeezed optical noise, and feasible measurement schemes on the output cavity modes, allow to obtain an advantage with respect to any comparable classical schemes. We apply these results to the discrimination of models of spontaneous collapse of the wavefunction, highlighting the possibilities offered by this scheme for fundamental physics searches.

AB The Restricted Syndrome Decoding Problem (R-SDP) corresponds to the Syndrome Decoding Problem (SDP) with the additional constraint that all entries of the solution error vector must live in a fixed subset of the finite field. In this paper, we study how this problem can be applied to the construction of signatures derived from Zero-Knowledge (ZK) protocols. First, we show that R-SDP appears to be well-suited for this type of application: ZK protocols relying on SDP can easily be modified to use R-SDP, resulting in significant reductions in the communication cost. We then introduce and analyze a variant of R-SDP, which we call R-SDP(G), with the property that solution vectors can be represented with a number of bits that is slightly larger than the security parameter (which clearly provides an ultimate lower bound). This enables the design of competitive ZK protocols. We show that existing ZK protocols can greatly benefit from the use of R-SDP, achieving signature sizes in the order of 7 kB, which are smaller than those of several other schemes submitted to NIST's additional call for post-quantum digital signatures.

TI Post Quantum Cryptographic Keys Generated with Physical Unclonable
   Functions
SO APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL
AB Featured Application
   Using physical unclonable functions (PUFs), in support of networks secured with a public key infrastructure, to generate, on demand, the key pairs needed for lattice and code PQC algorithms.
   Lattice and code cryptography can replace existing schemes such as elliptic curve cryptography because of their resistance to quantum computers. In support of public key infrastructures, the distribution, validation and storage of the cryptographic keys is then more complex for handling longer keys. This paper describes practical ways to generate keys from physical unclonable functions, for both lattice and code-based cryptography. Handshakes between client devices containing the physical unclonable functions (PUFs) and a server are used to select sets of addressable positions in the PUFs, from which streams of bits called seeds are generated on demand. The public and private cryptographic key pairs are computed from these seeds together with additional streams of random numbers. The method allows the server to independently validate the public key generated by the PUF, and act as a certificate authority in the network. Technologies such as high performance computing, and graphic processing units can further enhance security by preventing attackers from making this independent validation when only equipped with less powerful computers.

TI Cost of Universality: A Comparative Study of the Overhead of State
   Distillation and Code Switching with Color Codes
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB Estimating and reducing the overhead of fault-tolerance (FT) schemes is a crucial step toward realizing scalable quantum computers. Of particular interest are schemes based on two-dimensional (2D) topological codes such as the surface and color codes that have high thresholds but lack a natural implementation of a non-Clifford gate. In this work, we directly compare two leading FT implementations of the T gate in 2D color codes under circuit noise across a wide range of parameters in regimes of practical interest. We report that implementing the T gate via code switching to a three-dimensional (3D) color code does not offer substantial savings over state distillation in terms of either space or space-time overhead. We find a circuit-noise threshold of 0.07(1)% for the T gate via code switching, almost an order of magnitude below that achievable by state distillation in the same setting. To arrive at these results, we provide and simulate an optimized code-switching procedure, and bound the effect of various conceivable improvements. Many intermediate results in our analysis may be of independent interest. For example, we optimize the 2D color code for circuit noise yielding its largest threshold to date 0.37(1)%, and adapt and optimize the restriction decoder finding a threshold of 0.80(5)% for the 3D color code with perfect measurements under Z noise. Our work provides a much-needed direct comparison of the overhead of state distillation and code switching, and sheds light on the choice of future FT schemes and hardware designs.

TI Quantum mixed state compiling
SO QUANTUM SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB The task of learning a quantum circuit to prepare a given mixed state is a fundamental quantum subroutine. We present a variational quantum algorithm (VQA) to learn mixed states which is suitable for near-term hardware. Our algorithm represents a generalization of previous VQAs that aimed at learning preparation circuits for pure states. We consider two different ansatze for compiling the target state; the first is based on learning a purification of the state and the second on representing it as a convex combination of pure states. In both cases, the resources required to store and manipulate the compiled state grow with the rank of the approximation. Thus, by learning a lower rank approximation of the target state, our algorithm provides a means of compressing a state for more efficient processing. As a byproduct of our algorithm, one effectively learns the principal components of the target state, and hence our algorithm further provides a new method for principal component analysis. We investigate the efficacy of our algorithm through extensive numerical implementations, showing that typical random states and thermal states of many body systems may be learnt this way. Additionally, we demonstrate on quantum hardware how our algorithm can be used to study hardware noise-induced states.

TI Detecting nontrilocal correlations in a triangle network
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Correlations in quantum networks with independent sources exhibit a completely novel form of nonclassicality in the sense that the nonlocality of such correlations can be demonstrated in fixed local input scenarios. Before the pioneering work of Renou et al. [Phys. Rev. Lett. 123, 140401 (2019)], the nonlocal feature of such network correlations was directly attributable to standard Bell nonlocality. In the above-mentioned reference, the authors provided some of the first examples of triangle network correlations, whose nonlocality cannot be deduced from Bell-CHSH nonlocality. To date, a complete characterization of such scenarios has yet to be provided. The present work characterizes correlations arising due to fixed local measurements in a triangle network under a source independence assumption. Precisely speaking, a set of criteria is framed in the form of Bell-type inequalities, each of which is necessarily satisfied by trilocal correlations. Possible quantum violation of at least one criterion from the set is analyzed, which in turn points out the utility of the set of criteria to detect nonlocality (nontrilocality) in quantum triangle networks. Interestingly, measurement on a local product state basis turns out to be sufficient to generate nontrilocal correlations in some quantum networks. Noise tolerance of the detection criteria is discussed followed by a generalization of the framework for demonstrating correlations in any n-sided polygon where n is finite.

SO LETTERS IN MATHEMATICAL PHYSICS
AB We prove a multiplicative ergodic theorem for bistochastic completely positive (bcp) linear cocycles acting on finite-dimensional matrix algebras, giving an invariant splitting described explicitly in terms of the multiplicative domains of the underlying bcp maps. As an application of our theorem, we classify when compositions of random bcp maps are asymptotically entanglement breaking, and use this classification to show that occasionally positive partial transpose bcp maps are asymptotically entanglement breaking. We conclude by demonstrating a certain class of bcp linear cocycles are almost surely entanglement breaking in finite time.

TI The Semiring of Dichotomies and Asymptotic Relative Submajorization
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INFORMATION THEORY
AB We study quantum dichotomies and the resource theory of asymmetric distinguishability using a generalization of Strassen's theorem on preordered semirings. We find that an asymptotic variant of relative submajorization, defined on unnormalized dichotomies, is characterized by real-valued monotones that are multiplicative under the tensor product and additive under the direct sum. These strong constraints allow us to classify and explicitly describe all such monotones, leading to a rate formula expressed as an optimization involving sandwiched Renyi divergences. As an application we give a new derivation of the strong converse error exponent in quantum hypothesis testing.

TI Post-Quantum Wireless-Based Key Encapsulation Mechanism via
   CRYSTALS-Kyber for Resource-Constrained Devices
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB We consider the problem of adapting a Post-Quantum cryptosystem to be used in resource-constrained devices, such as those typically used in Device-to-Device and Internet of Things systems. In particular, we propose leveraging the characteristics of wireless communications channels to minimize the complexity of implementation of a Post-Quantum public key encryption scheme, without diminishing its security. To that end, we focus on the adaptation of a well-known cryptosystem, namely CRYSTALS-Kyber, so as to enable its direct integration into the lowest layer of the communication stack, the physical layer, defining two new transport schemes for CRYSTALS-Kyber to be used in Device-to-Device communications, both of which are modeled under a wireless channel subject to Additive White Gaussian Noise, using a 4 Quadrature Amplitude Modulation constellation and a BCH-code to communicate CRYSTALS-Kyber's polynomial coefficients. Simulation results demonstrate the viability of the adapted Kyber algorithm due to its low key error probability, while maintaining the security reductions of the original Kyber by considering the error distribution imposed by the channel on the cipher.

CY JUN 12-14, 2024
CL Oxford, ENGLAND
AB This paper shows novel techniques to reduce the signature size of the code-based signature schemes MEDS and ALTEQ, by a large factor. For both schemes, the signature size is dominated by the responses for rounds with nonzero challenges, and we reduce the signature size by reducing the size of these responses. For MEDS, each of the responses consists of m(2) + n(2) field elements, while in our new protocol each response consists of only 2k (k is usually chosen to be close to m and n) field elements. For ALTEQ, each of the responses consists of n(2) field elements, while in our new protocol each response consists of about root 2n(3/2) field elements. In both underlying S-protocols of the schemes, the prover generates a random isometry and sends the corresponding isometry to the verifier as the response. Instead of doing this, in our new protocols, the prover derives an isometry from some random code words and their presumed (full or partial) images. The prover sends the corresponding code words and images to the verifier as the response, so that the verifier can derive an isometry in the same way. Interestingly, it turns out that each response takes much fewer field elements to represent in this way.

TI Physical implementability for reversible magic state manipulation
SO COMMUNICATIONS PHYSICS
AB Magic states are essential for achieving universal quantum computation, yet the reversibility and efficiency of exact magic state manipulations remain less explored. Here we show that magic states in odd dimensions can be exactly and reversibly transformed under operations that preserve both the trace of states and positivity of discrete Wigner representation. Using the stochastic formalism, we demonstrate that magic mana emerges as the unique measure for such reversible magic state transformations. We propose the concept of physical implementability for characterizing the hardness and cost of maintaining reversibility. Our findings show that, analogous to the entanglement theory, going beyond the positivity constraint enables an exact reversible theory of magic manipulation. Physical implementability for quantum resource transformation provides a perspective for understanding and quantifying quantum resources, contributing to an operational framework for understanding the cost of reversible quantum resource manipulation.

TI A Quantum Differential Attack on ChaCha and Related Resources Estimation
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB Existing classical cryptanalytic techniques against ChaCha primarily rely on differential cryptanalysis, leveraging probabilistic neutral bits (PNBs) introduced by Aumasson et al. Separately, Bathe et al. proposed a quantum brute force search attack using Grover's algorithm with complexity 2(128) . However, since the setups for brute force attacks and differential attacks with probabilistic neutral bits differ significantly, the feasibility of applying Grover's algorithm to the existing differential attacks on ChaCha remained unclear. In this paper, we demonstrate for the first time that a quantum setup for a PNB-based differential attack is indeed possible on ChaCha, where we can utilize the power of Grover's algorithm to improve further. By combining Grover's algorithm with PNB-based differential attack, we propose a quantum algorithm for PNB based differential attack and present a quantum attack on 6-round ChaCha that provides more than a quadratic speedup. Specifically, our attack achieves a complexity of 2(70) , surpassing the quadratic speedup of the brute-force attack applying Grover's algorithm, proposed by Bathe et al. We achieve a circuit depth of 2(83) with our algorithm, marking a substantial advancement in efficiency.

TI Information compression via hidden subgroup quantum autoencoders
SO NPJ QUANTUM INFORMATION
AB We design a quantum method for classical information compression that exploits the hidden subgroup quantum algorithm. We consider sequence data in a database with a priori unknown symmetries of the hidden subgroup type. We prove that data with a given group structure can be compressed with the same query complexity as the hidden subgroup problem, which is exponentially faster than the best-known classical algorithms. We moreover design a quantum algorithm that variationally finds the group structure and uses it to compress the data. There is an encoder and a decoder, along the paradigm of quantum autoencoders. After the training, the encoder outputs a compressed data string and a description of the hidden subgroup symmetry, from which the input data can be recovered by the decoder. In illustrative examples, our algorithm outperforms the classical autoencoder on the mean squared value of test data. This classical-quantum separation in information compression capability has thermodynamical significance: the free energy assigned by a quantum agent to a system can be much higher than that of a classical agent. Taken together, our results show that a possible application of quantum computers is to efficiently compress certain types of data that cannot be efficiently compressed by current methods using classical computers.

AB This paper presents a general strategy to recover a block cipher secret key in the cold boot attack setting. More precisely, we propose a key-recovery method that combines key enumeration algorithms and Grover's quantum algorithm to recover a block cipher secret key after an attacker has procured a noisy version of it via a cold boot attack. We also show how to implement the quantum component of our algorithm for several block ciphers such as AES, PRESENT and GIFT, and LowMC. Additionally, since evaluating the third-round post-quantum candidates of the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) post-quantum standardization process against different attack vectors is of great importance for their overall assessment, we show the feasibility of performing our hybrid attack on Picnic, a post-quantum signature algorithm being an alternate candidate in the NIST post-quantum standardization competition. According to our results, our method may recover the Picnic private key for all Picnic parameter sets, tolerating up to 40% of noise for some of the parameter sets. Furthermore, we provide a detailed analysis of our method by giving the cost of its resources, its running time, and its success rate for various enumerations.

TI Bayesian critical points in classical lattice models
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
AB The Boltzmann distribution encodes our subjective knowledge of the configuration in a classical lattice model, given only its Hamiltonian. If we acquire further information about the configuration from measurement, our knowledge is updated according to Bayes' theorem. We examine the resulting "conditioned ensembles," finding that they show many new phase transitions and new renormalization-group fixed points. (Similar conditioned ensembles also describe "partial quenches" in which some of the system's degrees of freedom are instantaneously frozen, while the others continue to evolve.) After describing general features of the replica field theories for these problems, we analyze the effect of measurement on illustrative critical systems, including: critical Ising and Potts models, which show surprisingly rich phase diagrams, with RG fixed points at weak, intermediate, and infinite measurement strength; various models involving free fields, XY spins, or flux lines in 2D or 3D; and geometrical models such as polymers or clusters. We also give a formalism for measurement of classical stochastic processes. We use this to make connections with quantum dynamics, in particular with "charge sharpening" in 1D, for which we give a purely hydrodynamic derivation of the known effective field theory. We discuss qualitative differences between RG flows for the above measured systems, described by N -* 1 replica limits, and those for disordered systems, described by N -* 0 limits. In addition to discussing measurement of critical states, we give a unifying treatment of a family of inference problems for noncritical states. These are related to the Nishimori line in the phase diagram of the random-bond Ising model, and are relevant to various quantum error correction problems. We describe distinct physical interpretations of conditioned ensembles and note interesting open questions.

We demonstrate high-fidelity imaging of single Sr atoms using its even narrower (7.4-kHz wide) S-1(0)-P-3(1) transition. The atoms are trapped in nonmagic-wavelength tweezers. We detect the photons scattered during Sisyphus cooling, thus keeping the atoms near the motional ground state of the tweezer throughout imaging. The fidelity of detection is 0.9991(4) with a survival probability of 0.97(2). An atom in a tweezer can be held under imaging conditions for 79(3) seconds allowing for hundreds of images to be taken, limited mainly by background gas collisions. The use of a fully closed (cycling) transition for imaging will provide a useful tool for state specific detection. We detect atoms in an array of 36 tweezers with 813.4-nm light and trap depths of 135(20) mu K. This trap depth is three times shallower than typically used for imaging on the broad S-1(0)-P-1(1) transition. Narrow-line imaging opens the possibility to even further reduce this trap depth, as long as all trap frequencies are kept larger than the imaging transition linewidth. Imaging using a narrow-linewidth transition in a nonmagic-wavelength tweezer also allows for selective imaging of a given tweezer. As a demonstration, we selectively image (hide) a single tweezer from the array. This provides a useful tool for quantum error correction protocols.

TI Approximate Bacon-Shor code and holography
SO JOURNAL OF HIGH ENERGY PHYSICS
AB We explicitly construct a class of holographic quantum error correction codes with non-trivial centers in the code subalgebra. Specifically, we use the Bacon-Shor codes and perfect tensors to construct a gauge code (or a stabilizer code with gauge-fixing), which we call the holographic hybrid code. This code admits a local log-depth encoding/decoding circuit, and can be represented as a holographic tensor network which satisfies an analog of the Ryu-Takayanagi formula and reproduces features of the sub-region duality. We then construct approximate versions of the holographic hybrid codes by "skewing" the code subspace, where the size of skewing is analogous to the size of the gravitational constant in holography. These approximate hybrid codes are not necessarily stabilizer codes, but they can be expressed as the superposition of holographic tensor networks that are stabilizer codes. For such constructions, different logical states, representing different bulk matter content, can "back-react" on the emergent geometry, resembling a key feature of gravity. The locality of the bulk degrees of freedom becomes subspace-dependent and approximate. Such subspace-dependence is manifest from the point of view of the "entanglement wedge" and bulk operator reconstruction from the boundary. Exact complementary error correction breaks down for certain bipartition of the boundary degrees of freedom; however, a limited, state-dependent form is preserved for particular subspaces. We also construct an example where the connected two-point correlation functions can have a power-law decay. Coupled with known constraints from holography, a weakly back-reacting bulk also forces these skewed tensor network models to the "large N limit" where they are built by concatenating a large N number of copies.

AB Noiseless optical components are critical for applications ranging from metrology to quantum communication. Here, we characterize several commercial telecom C-band fiber components for parasitic noise using a tunable laser. We observe the spectral signature of trace concentrations of erbium in all devices from the underlying optical crystals including YVO4, LiNbO3, TeO2, and amorphous material transmitting infrared radiation glass. Due to the long erbium lifetime, these signals are challenging to mitigate at the single photon level in the telecom range and suggests the need for higher purity optical crystals.

TI Experimental verification of generalized eigenstate thermalization
   hypothesis in an integrable system
SO LIGHT-SCIENCE & APPLICATIONS
AB Identifying the general mechanics behind the equilibration of a complex isolated quantum system towards a state described by only a few parameters has been the focus of attention in non-equilibrium thermodynamics. And several experimentally unproven conjectures are proposed for the statistical description of quantum (non-)integrable models. The plausible eigenstate thermalization hypothesis (ETH), which suggests that each energy eigenstate itself is thermal, plays a crucial role in understanding the quantum thermalization in non-integrable systems; it is commonly believed that it does not exist in integrable systems. Nevertheless, integrable systems can still relax to the generalized Gibbs ensemble. From a microscopic perspective, understanding the origin of this generalized thermalization that occurs in an isolated integrable system is a fundamental open question lacking experimental investigations. Herein, we experimentally investigated the spin subsystem relaxation in an isolated spin-orbit coupling quantum system. By applying the quantum state engineering technique, we initialized the system with various distribution widths in the mutual eigenbasis of the conserved quantities. Then, we compared the steady state of the spin subsystem reached in a long-time coherent dynamics to the prediction of a generalized version of ETH and the underlying mechanism of the generalized thermalization is experimentally verified for the first time. Our results facilitate understanding the origin of quantum statistical mechanics.

TI Exact Nonequilibrium Steady State of XXZ Circuits Boundary Driven with
   Arbitrary Resets or Fields
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB We propose a spatially inhomogeneous matrix product Ansatz for an exact many-body density operator of a boundary-driven XXZ quantum circuit. The Ansatz has formally infinite bond dimension and is fundamentally different from previous constructions. The circuit is driven by a pair of reset quantum channels applied on the boundary qubits, which polarize the qubits to arbitrary pure target states. Moreover, one of the reset channels can be replaced by an arbitrary local unitary gate, thus representing a hybrid case with coherent and incoherent driving. Analyzing the Ansatz, we obtain a family of relatively robust separable nonequilibrium steady states, which can be viewed as a circuit extension of spin-helix states and are particularly suited for experimental investigations.

AB According to the properties of the Hadamard gate and GHZ state, a quantum authentication protocol with transferable information is proposed. This protocol has higher security and integrity. Specifically, the direct appearance of the key and the transmitted information are not required for both quantum and classical channels. In addition, the protocol realizes the key update in the process of identity authentication, which can automatically generate the key needed for the next information transmission. We expect that our protocol can be extended to many other quantum communication technologies.

TI Certifying semi-device-independent security via wave-particle duality
   experiments
SO NPJ QUANTUM INFORMATION
AB Wave-particle duality (WPD) is known to be equivalent to an entropic uncertainty relation (EUR) based on the min- and max-entropies, which have a clear operational meaning in quantum cryptography. Here, we derive a connection between wave-particle relations and the semi-device-independent (SDI) security framework. In particular, we express an SDI witness entirely in terms of two complementary interferometric quantities: visibility and input distinguishability. Applying a symmetry condition to the interferometric quantities, we identify a scenario in which the classical bound is violated and the security condition is met in wave-particle experiments with a tunable beam splitter (TBS). This enables the certification of non-classicality and the positivity of the key rate directly from complementary interferometric quantities, as well as from informational entropic quantities. Moreover, we perform a proof-of-principle experiment using orbital-angular-momentum (OAM) encoded quantum states of light in a tunable interferometer, validating our theoretical predictions. We analyze an improved bound on the SDI security condition for qubits, effectively enlarging the parameter region where secure communication can be certified. Finally, we extend the framework to multipath interferometers, establishing that the fundamental correspondence between information-access limitations and interferometric complementarity, demonstrated in the two-path scenario, persists across arbitrary dimensions.

TI Factoring the Modulus of Type N = p2q by
   Finding Small Solutions of the Equation er - (Ns plus
   t) = αp2 + βq2
SO MATHEMATICS
AB The modulus of type N=p(2)q is often used in many variants of factoring-based cryptosystems due to its ability to fasten the decryption process. Faster decryption is suitable for securing small devices in the Internet of Things (IoT) environment or securing fast-forwarding encryption services used in mobile applications. Taking this into account, the security analysis of such modulus is indeed paramount. This paper presents two cryptanalyses that use new enabling conditions to factor the modulus N=p(2)q of the factoring-based cryptosystem. The first cryptanalysis considers a single user with a public key pair (e,N) related via an arbitrary relation to equation er-(Ns+t)=ap(2)+beta q(2), where r,s,t are unknown parameters. The second cryptanalysis considers two distinct cases in the situation of k-users (i.e., multiple users) for k & GE;2, given the instances of (N-i,e(i)) where i=1, horizontal ellipsis ,k. By using the lattice basis reduction algorithm for solving simultaneous Diophantine approximation, the k-instances of (Ni,ei) can be successfully factored in polynomial time.

TI Optical Lattice-Induced Polarization State Modulation of Vector Vortex
   Fields
SO ANNALEN DER PHYSIK
AB Vector vortex beams, featuring spatially structured polarization states and helical phase fronts, emerge as a critical solution for enhancing optical information capacity beyond the constraints of traditional communication paradigms. In this paper, a coherent modulation strategy is established for creating two dimension (2D) vector vortex far-field diffraction arrays through light-atom interactions under electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT). A dynamically reconfigurable optical lattice is engineered via interference between a Gaussian-coupled field and a vortex-coupled field with adjustable topological charge. The atomic medium, when subjected to this lattice modulation, facilitates the diffraction of probe vector light fields into high-order vector vortex diffracted spots. This system enables multi-parameter tuning to significantly enhance diffraction efficiency. Results demonstrate that Comprehensive optimization of coupling field intensity, interference beam power distribution, and frequency detuning significantly enhances the relative diffraction efficiency. Moreover, the polarization state distribution of diffraction fields can be reconfigured by controlling optical lattice topological charges. This atomic medium-based optical lattice modulation framework offers flexibility in tailoring structured light arrays, bridging fundamental studies of structured light-matter interactions with advanced applications in high-dimensional optical encoding, quantum state engineering, and multifunctional optical manipulation systems.

TI Open-quantum-system simulation through exploiting noise on quantum
   computers
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB We present a general framework for simulating open quantum systems by exploiting the device noise. We find that pseudo-identity unitary transformations on system qubits in the presence of noise can generate nontrivial quantum channels driving open-system dynamics. Controlling parameters in these transformations allows us to simulate selective state-to-state transitions as well as the long-lived coherences found in systems such as photosynthetic light-harvesting complexes. These results suggest a general framework in which parameters in pseudo-identity unitary transformations can be chosen to generate arbitrary nonunitary system-bath channels without any additional qubits representing bath dynamics. The demonstrated controllability of the bath through these transformations establishes different possibilities for the efficient simulation of open quantum systems on quantum devices.

TI Multiqubit noise deconvolution and characterization
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB We present a noise deconvolution technique for obtaining noiseless expectation values of noisy observables at the output of multiqubit quantum channels. For any number of qubits or in the presence of correlations, our protocol applies to any mathematically invertible noise model, even when its inverse map is not physically implementable, i.e., when it is neither completely positive nor trace preserving. For a generic observable affected by Pauli noise it provides a quadratic speedup, always producing a rescaling of its Pauli basis components. We show that it is still possible to achieve the deconvolution while experimentally estimating the noise parameters, whenever these are unknown (bypassing resource-heavy techniques such as quantum process tomography). We provide a simulation, with examples for both Pauli and non-Pauli channels.

TI Toward Converged Satellite/Fiber 1550 nm DS-BB84 QKD Networks:
   Feasibility Analysis and System Requirements
SO PHOTONICS
AB Satellite-based QKD is currently being developed to revolutionize global cryptographic key exchange by facilitating secure communication among remote parties at a global scale. By overcoming the exponential loss of fiber transmission, satellite-to-Earth communication can seamlessly interconnect vast distances as the link budget of such links is sufficient to support QKD links. In terms of this direction, DV-QKD implementations seems to be technologically ahead since key exchange has been experimentally demonstrated to perform much more efficiently by providing key rates that are orders of magnitude higher compared to entanglement-based key exchange. However, the specific requirements to support effectively functional DV-QKD satellite-to-ground links are yet to be defined. This work attempts to define the satellite and ground segment system requirements needed in order to achieve functional QKD service for various satellites orbits (LEO, MEO, and GEO). Finite key size effects are being considered to determine the minimum block sizes that are required for secure key generation between a satellite node and a ground terminal for a single satellite pass. The atmospheric link channel is modeled with consideration of the most important degradation effects such as turbulence and atmospheric and pointing loss. Critical Tx and Rx system parameters, such as the source's intrinsic Quantum Bit Error Rate (iQBER), the Rx telescope aperture size, and detection efficiency, were investigated in order to define the minimum requirements to establish an operation satellite-to-ground QKD link under specific assumptions. The performance of each downlink scenario was evaluated for the wavelength of 1550 nm in terms of link availability, link budget, and in the distilling of secure key volumes over time. Finally, the feasibility and requirements for distributing the collected space photons via terrestrial telecom fibers was also studied and discussed, leading to the proposal of a more futuristic WDM-enabled satellite QKD architecture. This comprehensive analysis aims to contribute to the advancement and implementation of effective satellite-based QKD systems, which can further exploit the ground fiber segment to realize converged space/terrestrial QKD networks.

   Dynamics
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB Quantum synchronization is crucial for understanding complex dynamics and holds potential applications in quantum computing and communication. Therefore, assessing the thermodynamic resources required for finite-time synchronization in continuous-variable systems is a critical challenge. In the present work, we find these resources to be extensive for large systems. We also bound the speed of quantum and classical synchronization in coupled damped oscillators with non-Hermitian antiPT -symmetric interactions, and show that the speed of synchronization is limited by the interaction strength relative to the damping. Compared to the classical limit, we find that quantum synchronization is slowed by the noncommutativity of the Hermitian and anti-Hermitian terms. Our general results could be tested experimentally, and we suggest an implementation in photonic systems.

TI Exponential optimization of adiabatic quantum-state preparation
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB The preparation of a given quantum state on a quantum computing register is a typically demanding operation, requiring a number of elementary gates that scales exponentially with the size of the problem. Using the adiabatic theorem for state preparation, whose error decreases exponentially as a function of the preparation time, we derive an explicit analytic expression for the dependence of the characteristic time on the Hamiltonian used in the adiabatic evolution. Exploiting this knowledge, we then design a preconditioning term that modifies the adiabatic preparation, thus reducing its characteristic time and hence giving an exponential advantage in state preparation. We prove the efficiency of our method with extensive numerical experiments on prototypical spin models, which gives a promising strategy to perform quantum simulations of manybody models via Trotter evolution on near-term quantum processors.

TI Toward witnessing molecular exciton entanglement from spectroscopy
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Entanglement is a defining feature of quantum mechanics that can be a resource in engineered and natural systems, but measuring entanglement in experiment remains elusive especially for large chemical systems. Most practical approaches require determining and measuring a suitable entanglement witness which provides some level of information about the entanglement structure of the probed state. A fundamental quantity of quantum metrology is the quantum Fisher information (QFI), which is a rigorous witness of multipartite entanglement that can be evaluated from linear response functions for certain states. In this paper, we explore measuring the QFI of molecular exciton states of the first-excitation subspace from spectroscopy. In particular, we utilize the fact that the linear response of a pure state subject to a weak electric field over all possible driving frequencies encodes the variance of the collective dipole moment in the probed state, which is a valid measure for QFI. The systems that are investigated include the molecular dimer, N-site linear aggregate with nearest-neighbor coupling, and N-site circular aggregate, all modeled as a collection of interacting qubits. Our theoretical analysis shows that the variance of the collective dipole moment in the brightest dipole-allowed eigenstate is the maximum QFI. The optical response of a thermally equilibrated state in the first-excitation subspace is also a valid QFI. Theoretical predictions of the measured QFI for realistic linear dye aggregates as a function of temperature and energetic disorder due to static variations of the host matrix show that two- to three-partite entanglement is realizable. This paper lays some groundwork and inspires measurement of multipartite entanglement of molecular excitons with ultrafast pump-probe experiments.

SO INORGANICS
AB Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) are emerging porous materials with highly tunable structures developed in the 1990s, while organometallic chemistry is of fundamental importance for catalytic transformation in the academic and industrial world for many decades. Through the years, organometallic chemistry has been incorporated into functional MOF construction for diverse applications. Here, we will focus on how organometallic chemistry is applied in MOF design and modifications from linker-centric and metal-cluster-centric perspectives, respectively. Through structural design, MOFs can function as a tailorable platform for traditional organometallic transformations, including reaction of alkenes, cross-coupling reactions, and C-H activations. Besides, an overview will be made on other application categories of organometallic MOFs, such as gas adsorption, magnetism, quantum computing, and therapeutics.

TI Quantum circuit for non-unitary linear transformation of basis sets
SO NPJ QUANTUM INFORMATION
AB This paper presents a novel approach for implementing non-unitary basis transformations on quantum computational platforms, extending beyond conventional unitary methods. By integrating Singular Value Decomposition (SVD), the method achieves operational depth O(n) with about n ancilla qubits, enhancing the analysis of fermionic systems. The non-unitary transformation enables mapping a wavefunction between different bases, allowing the calculation of overlaps of states residing in distinct Hilbert subspaces. This capability supports the use of state-specific ansatzes to compute multiple energy eigenstates under orbital-optimized settings, potentially improving accuracy in variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) and related frameworks. Overall, the method expands the range of accessible quantum states and phenomena, offering new opportunities for applying quantum computing in physics and chemistry.

TI Cryogenic in situ fabrication of reversible direct write logic circuits
   and devices
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Signal transmission across cryogenic and room-temperature environments remains a significant bottleneck in superconducting quantum computing and classical circuit integration. Furthermore, interactions among cryogenic devices often require room-temperature interfacing, driving substantial demand for data read/write interfaces, which in turn increases interconnect complexity and constrains scalability. In situ fabrication of cryogenic, high-performance logic circuits and devices presents a promising solution to address this "wiring bottleneck". Here, we demonstrated interfacial two-dimensional electron gas devices with reversible interface states that can be directly modulated at operating temperatures while achieving an unprecedented ultrahigh on/off ratio. Remarkably, these devices can be patterned using a "light pencil" and erased with a pulsed electric field, enabling resist free, in situ direct writing and electrical erasure of the interface state.

TI Resolved-sideband micromotion sensing in Yb+ on the 935 nm
   repump transition
SO AIP ADVANCES
AB Ions displaced from the potential minimum in an RF Paul trap exhibit excess micromotion. A host of well-established techniques are routinely used to sense (and null) this excessive motion in applications ranging from quantum computing to atomic clocks. The rich atomic structure of Yb+, a heavy ion, includes low-lying D-2(3/2) states that must be repumped to permit Doppler cooling, typically using a 935 nm laser coupled to the D-3[3/2](1/2) states. In this article, we demonstrate the use of this transition to make resolved-sideband measurements of 3D micromotion in Yb-172(+) and Yb-171(+) ions. Relative to other sensing techniques, our approach has very low technical overhead and is distinctively compatible with surface-electrode ion traps. (C) 2022 Author(s).

TI Quantum Neural Network Based Distinguisher on SPECK-32/64
SO SENSORS
AB As IoT technology develops, many sensor devices are being used in our life. To protect such sensor data, lightweight block cipher techniques such as SPECK-32 are applied. However, attack techniques for these lightweight ciphers are also being studied. Block ciphers have differential characteristics, which are probabilistically predictable, so deep learning has been utilized to solve this problem. Since Gohr's work at Crypto2019, many studies on deep-learning-based distinguishers have been conducted. Currently, as quantum computers are developed, quantum neural network technology is developing. Quantum neural networks can also learn and make predictions on data, just like classical neural networks. However, current quantum computers are constrained by many factors (e.g., the scale and execution time of available quantum computers), making it difficult for quantum neural networks to outperform classical neural networks. Quantum computers have higher performance and computational speed than classical computers, but this cannot be achieved in the current quantum computing environment. Nevertheless, it is very important to find areas where quantum neural networks work for technology development in the future. In this paper, we propose the first quantum neural network based distinguisher for the block cipher SPECK-32 in an NISQ. Our quantum neural distinguisher successfully operated for up to 5 rounds even under constrained conditions. As a result of our experiment, the classical neural distinguisher achieved an accuracy of 0.93, but our quantum neural distinguisher achieved an accuracy of 0.53 due to limitations in data, time, and parameters. Due to the constrained environment, it cannot exceed the performance of classical neural networks, but it can operate as a distinguisher because it has obtained an accuracy of 0.51 or higher. In addition, we performed an in-depth analysis of the quantum neural network's various factors that affect the performance of the quantum neural distinguisher. As a result, it was confirmed that the embedding method, the number of the qubit, and quantum layers, etc., have an effect. It turns out that if a high-capacity network is needed, we have to properly tune properly to take into account the connectivity and complexity of the circuit, not just by adding quantum resources. In the future, if more quantum resources, data, and time become available, it is expected that an approach to achieve better performance can be designed by considering the various factors presented in this paper.

TI Quantum computational resources for lattice QCD in the strong-coupling
   limit
SO EPJ QUANTUM TECHNOLOGY
AB We consider the strong-coupling limit of lattice QCD with massless staggered quarks and study the resource requirements for quantum simulating the theory in its Hamiltonian formulation. The bosonic Hilbert space of the color-singlet degrees of freedom grows quickly with the number of quark flavors N-f, making it a suitable testing ground for resource considerations across different platforms. In particular, in addition to the standard model of computation with qubits, we consider mapping the theory to qudits (d> 2) and qumodes, as used on atomic systems and photonic devices, respectively. We subsequently derive the resource requirements to quantum simulate the theory, for varying number of quark flavors N-f = 1and N-f = 2,, using a first-order product formula.

Since cloud computing adoption is still ongoing, the federal government continues to focus on the steps necessary to move the government forward from a state of partial adoption. This paper analyzes the government approach to cloud computing adoption to identify changes that can be implemented to optimize quantum computing adoption. The research found that evolving cloud definitions, required governance changes, cloud workforce competition, competing enterprise requirements, and contracting approach issues were the primary adoption impediments.

TI Modified Grover operator for quantum amplitude estimation
SO NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB In this paper, we propose a quantum amplitude estimation method that uses a modified Grover operator and quadratically improves the estimation accuracy in the ideal case, as in the conventional one using the standard Grover operator. Under the depolarizing noise, the proposed method can outperform the conventional one in the sense that it can in principle achieve the ultimate estimation accuracy characterized by the quantum Fisher information in the limit of a large number of qubits, while the conventional one cannot achieve the same value of ultimate accuracy. In general this superiority requires a sophisticated adaptive measurement, but we numerically demonstrate that the proposed method can outperform the conventional one and approach to the ultimate accuracy, even with a simple non-adaptive measurement strategy.

TI Error-Based Restarted Simpler QGMRES for Image Denoising Problem
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB QGMRES is an effective approach for solving quaternion linear systems. Without solving upper Hessenberg minimization problem, SQGMRES is the simpler version of QGMRES. Similar to restarted GMRES and SGMRES, the residual vectors at the end of each restart cycle in SQGMRES also alternate direction in a cyclic manner. Motivated by LGMRES and SLGMRES, in this paper, we present an acceleration strategy for SQGMRES by disrupting the alternation, and the convergence theory of new algorithm is provided. Finally, we apply new algorithms to color image denoising problems, and the experimental results showed a significant decrease in both the number of iterations and the required time compared to QGMRES.

SO ACS APPLIED ELECTRONIC MATERIALS
AB One of the most promising platforms for the realization of spin-based quantum computing are planar germanium quantum wells embedded between silicon-germanium barriers. To achieve comparably thin stacks with little surface roughness, this type of heterostructure can be grown using the so-called reverse linear grading approach, where the growth starts with a virtual germanium substrate followed by a graded silicon-germanium alloy with an increasing silicon content. However, the compatibility of such reverse-graded heterostructures with superconducting microwave resonators has not yet been demonstrated. Here, we report on the successful realization of well-controlled double quantum dots and high-quality coplanar waveguide resonators on the same reverse-graded Ge/SiGe heterostructure.

TI Continuous optimization by quantum adaptive distribution search
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB We introduce the quantum adaptive distribution search (QuADS), a quantum continuous optimization algorithm that integrates Grover adaptive search (GAS) with the covariance matrix adaptation evolution strategy (CMA-ES), a classical technique for continuous optimization. QuADS utilizes the quantum-based search capabilities of GAS and enhances them with the principles of CMA-ES for more efficient optimization. It employs a multivariate normal distribution for the initial state of the quantum search and repeatedly updates it throughout the optimization process. Our numerical simulations show that QuADS outperforms both GAS and CMA-ES. This is achieved through adaptive refinement of the initial state distribution rather than consistently using a uniform state, resulting in fewer oracle calls. This study presents an important step toward exploiting the potential of quantum computing for continuous optimization.

TI Experimentally Finding Dense Subgraphs Using a Time-Bin Encoded Gaussian

SO PHYSICAL REVIEW X
AB Gaussian boson sampling is a quantum computing concept based on drawing samples from a multimode nonclassical Gaussian state using photon-number resolving detectors. It was initially posed as a near-term approach to achieve quantum advantage, and several applications have been proposed since, including the calculation of graph features. For the first time, we use a time-bin encoded interferometer to implement Gaussian boson sampling experimentally and extract samples to enhance the search for dense subgraphs in a graph. Our results indicate an improvement over classical methods for subgraphs of sizes three and four in a graph containing ten nodes. In addition, we numerically explore the role of imperfections in the optical circuit and on the performance of the algorithm.

TI Enhanced federated learning for secure medical data collaboration
SO JOURNAL OF ANALYTICAL SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB Federated learning (FL) enables collaborative model training across multiple institutions while preserving data privacy. However, conventional encryption techniques used in FL remain vulnerable to quantum attacks, raising concerns about the security of model update transmissions. To address this, we propose a quantum-safe federated learning framework, which integrates a post-quantum lattice-based digital signature scheme into the FL communication protocol. Unlike traditional cryptographic methods, lattice-based signatures provide resilience against quantum adversaries while maintaining efficiency in resource-constrained environments. Our approach is evaluated on brain tumor and colorectal polyp segmentation datasets from Kaggle, demonstrating its effectiveness in securing FL updates with minimal computational overhead. The results highlight the feasibility of quantum-secure FL, particularly in hospital environments with limited quantum computing access.

TI Performance and Applicability of Post-Quantum Digital Signature
   Algorithms in Resource-Constrained Environments
SO ALGORITHMS
AB The continuous development of quantum computing necessitates the development of quantum-resistant cryptographic algorithms. In response to this demand, the National Institute of Standards and Technology selected standardized algorithms including Crystals-Dilithium, Falcon, and Sphincs+ for digital signatures. This paper provides a comparative evaluation of these algorithms across key metrics. The results indicate varying strengths and weaknesses for each algorithm, underscoring the importance of context-specific deployments. Our findings indicate that Dilithium offers advantages in low-power scenarios, Falcon excels in signature verification speed, and Sphincs+ provides robust security at the cost of computational efficiency. These results underscore the importance of context-specific deployments in specific and resource-constrained technological applications, like IoT, smart cards, blockchain, and vehicle-to-vehicle communication.

SO JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL PHYSICS
AB We formulate and implement the Variational Quantum Eigensolver Self Consistent Field (VQE-SCF) algorithm in combination with polarizable embedding (PE), thereby extending PE to the regime of quantum computing. We test the resulting algorithm, PE-VQE-SCF, on quantum simulators and demonstrate that the computational stress on the quantum device is only slightly increased in terms of gate counts compared to regular VQE-SCF. On the other hand, no increase in shot noise was observed. We illustrate how PE-VQE-SCF may lead to the modeling of real chemical systems using a simulation of the reaction barrier of the Diels-Alder reaction between furan and ethene as an example.

AB We analyze the dynamics of the Rabi model describing interactions of a qubit with a single soft-mode oscillator. We show that the model with a slightly violated parity generates symmetric Schrodinger cat states of the oscillator, which suddenly perish in a spontaneous unitary process similar to the measurement-induced wave-function collapse. The effect is sufficiently robust to be tested experimentally, e.g., with trapped ions, macroscopic mechanical oscillators, or superconducting circuits.

TI Acoustic spin skyrmion molecule lattices enabling stable transport and
   flexible manipulation
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Skyrmions-topologically protected nanoscale spin textures with vortex-like configurations-hold transformative potential for ultra-dense data storage, spintronics and quantum computing. However, their practical utility is challenged by dynamic instability, complex interaction, and the lack of deterministic control. Here, we introduce a skyrmion molecule lattice, a novel architecture where pairs of skyrmions with opposite polarizability are symmetry-locked into stable molecule configurations. These molecules emerge as propagating eigenstates of the system, enabling robust transport. Using a boundary engineering technique, we achieve deterministic control over skyrmion creation, deformation, annihilation, and polarizability inversion. This is experimentally demonstrated in a graphene-inspired acoustic surface wave metamaterial by harnessing topological acoustic spin structures. Our work, leveraging symmetry principles, establishes a universal framework for stabilizing, transporting and manipulating the skyrmion quasiparticles.

   interactions
SO COMMUNICATIONS PHYSICS
AB Spin-triplet superconductivity is a key platform for topological quantum computing, yet its experimental realization and control in solid-state materials remain a significant challenge. For this purpose, we propose an ultrafast optical strategy to manipulate spin-triplet superconductivity by leveraging p-wave pairing instabilities in the extended Hubbard model, a framework applicable to transition-metal oxides. Utilizing Floquet engineering, we demonstrate that transient flipping of the effective spin-exchange interaction can enhance p-wave pairing correlations under linearly polarized optical pulses. Furthermore, we reveal that this emergent spin-triplet pairing in strongly correlated systems can be selectively switched by an orthogonal optical pulse. This work provides a pathway for stabilizing and controlling spin-triplet superconductivity in correlated materials.

TI Manipulation of phonon states in ion traps by shortcuts to adiabaticity
SO NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB Shortcuts to adiabaticity (STA) provides the possibility of high accuracy manipulation of phonon states in ion traps. We propose a scheme realized experimentally for manipulating phonon states using STA and confirmed its effectiveness through generating Fock states. Our results show that the duration of the STA manipulation of phonon states is 16 times faster than that of the adiabatic evolution, and the non-resonant excitation can be suppressed by laser bias frequency, which are confirmed by experimental results. Moreover, we also carried out an experimental research on the robustness of STA, showing good robustness respect to the pulse shape deformation, bias noises and stochastic noise. This might lead to a useful step toward realizing fast and noise-resistant quantum manipulation within current experimental capacity.

SO QUANTUM SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB Necessary and sufficient conditions for quantum Hamiltonians to be exactly solvable within mean-field (MF) theories have not been formulated so far. To resolve this problem, first, we define what MF theory is, independently of a Hamiltonian realization in a particular set of operators. Second, using a Lie-algebraic framework we formulate a criterion for a Hamiltonian to be MF solvable. The criterion is applicable for both distinguishable and indistinguishable particle cases. For the electronic Hamiltonians, our approach reveals the existence of MF solvable Hamiltonians of higher fermionic operator powers than quadratic. Some of the MF solvable Hamiltonians require different sets of quasi-particle rotations for different eigenstates, which reflects a more complicated structure of such Hamiltonians.

TI Quantifying n-Photon Indistinguishability with a Cyclic
   Integrated Interferometer
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW X
AB We report on a universal method to measure the genuine indistinguishability of n photons-a crucial parameter that determines the accuracy of optical quantum computing. Our approach relies on a low-depth cyclic multiport interferometer with N = 2n modes, leading to a quantum interference fringe whose visibility is a direct measurement of the genuine n-photon indistinguishability. We experimentally demonstrate this technique for an eight-mode integrated interferometer fabricated using femtosecond laser micromachining and four photons from a quantum dot single-photon source. We measure a four-photon indistinguishability up to 0.81 + 0.03. This value decreases as we intentionally alter the photon pairwise indistinguishability. The low-depth and low-loss multiport interferometer design provides an original path to evaluate the genuine indistinguishability of resource states of increasing photon number.

SO THEORETICAL COMPUTER SCIENCE
AB Reversible Boolean Circuits are an interesting computational model under many aspects and in different fields, ranging from Reversible Computing to Quantum Computing. Our contribution is to describe a specific class of Reversible Boolean Circuits- which is as expressive as classical circuits- as a bi-dimensional diagrammatic programming language. We uniformly represent the Reversible Boolean Circuits we focus on as a free 3-category Toff. This formalism allows us to incorporate the representation of circuits and of rewriting rules on them, and to prove termination of rewriting. Termination follows from defining a non-identities-preserving functor from our free 3-category Toff into a suitable 3-category Move that traces the "moves" applied to wires inside circuits.

TI Lattice renormalization of quantum simulations
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW D
AB With advances in quantum computing, new opportunities arise to tackle challenging calculations in quantum field theory. We show that trotterized time-evolution operators can be related by analytic continuation to the Euclidean transfer matrix on an anisotropic lattice. In turn, trotterization entails renormalization of the temporal and spatial lattice spacings. Based on the tools of Euclidean lattice field theory, we propose two schemes to determine Minkowski lattice spacings, using Euclidean data and thereby overcoming the demands on quantum resources for scale setting. In addition, we advocate using a fixed-anisotropy approach to the continuum to reduce both circuit depth and number of independent simulations. We demonstrate these methods with qiskit noiseless simulators for a 2 thorn 1D discrete nonAbelian D4 gauge theory with two spatial plaquettes.

SO NATURE PHOTONICS
AB Recently, machine learning has had remarkable impact in scientific to everyday-life applications. However, complex tasks often require the consumption of unfeasible amounts of energy and computational power. Quantum computation may lower such requirements, although it is unclear whether enhancements are reachable with current technologies. Here we demonstrate a kernel method on a photonic integrated processor to perform a binary classification task. We show that our protocol outperforms state-of-the-art kernel methods such as gaussian and neural tangent kernels by exploiting quantum interference, and provides further improvements in accuracy by offering single-photon coherence. Our scheme does not require entangling gates and can modify the system dimension through additional modes and injected photons. This result gives access to more efficient algorithms and to formulating tasks where quantum effects improve standard methods.

TI Orbital angular momentum uncertainty relations of entangled two-photon
   states
SO EUROPEAN PHYSICAL JOURNAL D
AB The inseparability of quantum correlation requires that the particles in the composite system be treated as a whole rather than treated separately, a typical example is the Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR) paradox. In this paper, we provide a theoretical study on the uncertainty relations of two kinds of bipartite observables in two-photon orbital angular momentum (OAM) entanglement, that is, the relative distance and centroid of the two photons at azimuth. We find that the uncertainty relations of the bipartite observables holds in any two-photon state, and they are separable in two-photon OAM entanglement. In addition, the entangled state behaves as a single particle in the bipartite representation. Finally, we find that the uncertainty relations of the bipartite observables can be used to manipulate the degree of the entanglement of an EPR state.

TI Nonstabilizerness in U(1) lattice gauge theory
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
AB We present a thorough investigation of nonstabilizerness-a fundamental quantum resource that quantifies state complexity within the framework of quantum computing-in a one-dimensional U(1) lattice gauge theory including matter fields. We show how nonstabilizerness is always extensive with volume, and has no direct relation to the presence of critical points. However, its derivatives typically display discontinuities across the latter: This indicates that nonstabilizerness is strongly sensitive to criticality, but in a manner that is very different from entanglement (which, typically, is maximal at the critical point). Our results indicate that error-corrected simulations of lattice gauge theories close to the continuum limit have similar computational costs to those at finite correlation length and provide rigorous lower bounds for quantum resources of such quantum computations.

TI Precisely tunable and predictable index-near-zero modes across
   continuous and broad bands
SO APPLIED PHYSICS LETTERS
AB In the past two decades, index-near-zero (INZ) modes and materials, with their spatial phase invariance and super coupling, gained increasing attention for applications in all-optical/quantum computing and communication. However, the modulation of INZ modes is typically complex and discontinuous, often achieved through intricate experimental methods, thereby hindering their widespread application. Here, we propose two deep-subwavelength magneto-optical one-way waveguides and discover three broadband tunable INZ modes, exhibiting predictable behavior dependent on the external magnetic field (EMF). By utilizing these INZ modes, we design broadband tunable all-optical phase modulators through straightforward EMF control. The tunable and predictable nature of INZ modes, combined with deep-subwavelength phase modulators, may advance miniaturized all-optical communication and computation.

TI Multiplicative topological semimetals
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
AB Exhaustive study of topological semimetal (TSM) phases of matter in equilibriated electonic systems and myriad extensions has built upon the foundations laid by earlier introduction and study of Weyl semimetals, with broad applications in topologically protected quantum computing, spintronics, and optical devices. We extend recent introduction of multiplicative topological phases to find previously overlooked TSM phases of electronic systems in equilibrium, with minimal symmetry protection. We show these multiplicative TSM (MTSM) phases exhibit rich and distinctive bulk-boundary correspondence and response signatures that greatly expand understanding of consequences of topology in condensed matter settings, such as the limits on Fermi arc connectivity and structure, and transport signatures such as the chiral anomaly. In this paper, we therefore lay the foundation for extensive future study of MTSMs.

TI Optical registration of a coherent magnon state outside of the
   excitation region
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB Magnons have demonstrated enormous potential for the next generation of information technology and quantum computing. In particular, the coherent state of magnons resulting from their Bose-Einstein condensation (mBEC) is of great interest. Typically, mBEC is formed in the magnon excitation region. Here we demonstrate for the first time by optical methods the permanent existence of mBEC at large distances from the magnon excitation region. The homogeneity of the mBEC phase is also demonstrated. The experiments were carried out on films of yttrium iron garnet magnetized perpendicular to the surface and at room temperature. We use the method described in this article to develop coherent magnonics and quantum logic devices. (c) 2023 Optica Publishing Group under the terms of the Optica Open Access Publishing Agreement

AB This work presents the SOI Junctionless Fin-FET characterization in Deep Cryogenic behavior (DC-JLFET). Results show that the JLT device is well-suited for various operations, such as computation, sensing, and communication in the quantum field. The cryogenic transfer characteristics, including bias, and interface trap density, are analyzed over a broad temperature range (300 Kelvin down to 4.2 Kelvin). Cryogenic DC and RF analyses were done on the conventional double-gate JL-FET structure, operating at 300 K and below 4.2 K for different geometries. The suggested study illustrates that cryogenic status in the new technology CMOS can be correctly anticipated by calibrating data using an experimental device.

TI Twisted hybrid algorithms for combinatorial optimization
SO QUANTUM SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB Proposed hybrid algorithms encode a combinatorial cost function into a problem Hamiltonian and optimize its energy by varying over a set of states with low circuit complexity. Classical processing is typically only used for the choice of variational parameters following gradient descent. As a consequence, these approaches are limited by the descriptive power of the associated states. We argue that for certain combinatorial optimization problems, such algorithms can be hybridized further, thus harnessing the power of efficient non-local classical processing. Specifically, we consider combining a quantum variational ansatz with a greedy classical post-processing procedure for the MaxCut-problem on three-regular graphs. We show that the average cut-size produced by this method can be quantified in terms of the energy of a modified problem Hamiltonian. This motivates the consideration of an improved algorithm which variationally optimizes the energy of the modified Hamiltonian. We call this a twisted hybrid algorithm since the additional classical processing step is combined with a different choice of variational parameters. We exemplify the viability of this method using the quantum approximate optimization algorithm (QAOA), giving analytic lower bounds on the expected approximation ratios achieved by twisted QAOA. We observe that for levels p - 1, ..., 5, these lower bounds are comparable to the known lower bounds on QAOA at level p + 1 for high-girth graphs. This suggests that using twisted QAOA can reduce the circuit depth by 4 and the number of variational parameters by 2.

TI Physical Computing: Unifying Real Number Computation to Enable Energy
   Efficient Computing
SO JOURNAL OF LOW POWER ELECTRONICS AND APPLICATIONS
AB Physical computing unifies real value computing including analog, neuromorphic, optical, and quantum computing. Many real-valued techniques show improvements in energy efficiency, enable smaller area per computation, and potentially improve algorithm scaling. These physical computing techniques suffer from not having a strong computational theory to guide application development in contrast to digital computation's deep theoretical grounding in application development. We consider the possibility of a real-valued Turing machine model, the potential computational and algorithmic opportunities of these techniques, the implications for implementation applications, and the computational complexity space arising from this model. These techniques have shown promise in increasing energy efficiency, enabling smaller area per computation, and potentially improving algorithm scaling.

TI Parametric instability in a magnomechanical system
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
AB We study parametric instability in a magnomechanical system, specifically examining magnon tunneling between moving ferromagnetic insulators. Our analysis reveals that quantum fluctuations generate spin currents above a critical velocity threshold, while no spin currents occur below this threshold at low temperatures. The critical velocity depends on magnon stiffness and Zeeman energy. Approaching the threshold, the spin current becomes divergent, linked to the PT-symmetry-breaking transition. This enhanced behavior could offer high-sensitivity measurements and efficient spin-current generation in magnon-based quantum technology.

TI Entanglement Swapping for Partially Entangled Qudits and the Role of
   Quantum Complementarity
SO ADVANCED QUANTUM TECHNOLOGIES
AB The entanglement swapping protocol (ESP) is extended to partially entangled qudit states and the process within the framework of complete complementarity relations (CCRs) is analyzed. Building on previous results for qubits, it is shown that the average distributed entanglement between two parties via ESP is bounded above by the initial entanglement of one of the input pairs, and also by the product of the initial entanglements. Notably, it is found that using initial states with vanishing local quantum coherence is sufficient to capture the essential features of the protocol, simplifying the analysis. By exploring the cases of qubits and qutrits, it is observed that the upper bound on the average distributed entanglement-expressed in terms of the product of the initial entanglements-can be improved, and what this tighter bound might be is conjectured. Finally, the role of quantum complementarity in the ESP is discussed and how local predictability constrains the entanglement that can be operationally distributed via ESP is shown.

Here, a straightforward and elegant method for determining the topological charge of an optical vortex using an innovative switchable achromatic nematic liquid crystal Fresnel lens is proposed. The approach allows for the unambiguous determination of both the absolute value and the sign of the topological charge of a singular beam across a wide range of the visible spectrum, as demonstrated both experimentally and theoretically. The research outcomes are promising for applications in optical information transmission systems, cryptography, and quantum computing.

TI Denoising and Extension of Response Functions in the Time Domain
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB Response functions of quantum systems, such as electron Green 's functions, magnetic, or charge susceptibilities, describe the response of a system to an external perturbation. They are the central objects of interest in field theories and quantum computing and measured directly in experiment. Response functions are intrinsically causal. In equilibrium and steady-state systems, they correspond to a positive spectral function in the frequency domain. Since response functions define an inner product on a Hilbert space and thereby induce a positive definite function, the properties of this function can be used to reduce noise in measured data and, in equilibrium and steady state, to construct positive definite extensions for data known on finite time intervals, which are then guaranteed to correspond to positive spectra.

TI Optically induced nuclear spin-spin couplings in GaAs manifested by spin
   echo decays under optical pumping
SO NPJ QUANTUM INFORMATION
AB Optically induced nuclear spin-spin coupling in semiconductors is expected to serve for gate operations in nuclear-magnetic-resonance (NMR) quantum computations. However, not much is known about its characteristics. In this study, we investigate optically induced couplings in GaAs via double-resonance spin-echo decay experiments under optical pumping. The squared echo decay rate (1/T-2)(2) of Ga-71 measured under various light powers revealed that optically induced couplings increase with increasing light power, and the sign of heteronuclear couplings between Ga-As pairs is opposite to that of dipolar couplings, which cancel each other out. Under higher light power, the optically induced "controllable" coupling is expected to eventually surpass the "uncontrollable" nuclear dipolar coupling, becoming dominant, which is preferable for the gate operation in NMR quantum computation.

AB In a recent publication [S. Gan, Laser Phys. 31, 055401 (2021)], a scheme for controlling the vortex four-wave mixing (FWM) in a five-level atomic system has been put forward. Based on this work, we propose a new scheme for the spatial manipulation via four-wave mixing in a five-level atomic system when the radial index is considered. It is found that the phase and intensity of the FWM field can be spatially manipulated. More importantly, we show the superposition modes created by the interference between the FWM field and a same-frequency Gaussian beam, which can also be controlled via the corresponding parameters. Our research is helpful to understand and manipulate optical vortices and can be widely used in quantum computation and communication.

TI Quantum data hiding with continuous-variable systems
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Suppose we want to benchmark a quantum device held by a remote party, e.g., by testing its ability to carry out challenging quantum measurements outside of a free set of measurements M. A very simple way to do so is to set up a binary-state discrimination task that cannot be solved efficiently by means of free measurements. If we can find pairs of orthogonal states that become arbitrarily indistinguishable under measurements in M, in the sense that the error probability in discrimination approaches that of a random guess, we say that there are data hiding against M. Here we investigate data hiding in the context of continuous-variable quantum systems. First, we look at the case where M denotes the set of measurements implementable with local operations and classical communication. While previous studies have placed upper bounds on the maximum efficiency of data hiding in terms of the local dimension and are thus not applicable to continuous-variable systems, we establish more general bounds that rely solely on the local mean photon number of the states employed. Along the way, we perform a rigorous quantitative analysis of the error introduced by the nonideal Braunstein-Kimble quantum teleportation protocol, determining how much squeezing and local detection efficiency are needed in order to teleport an arbitrary multimode local state of known mean energy with a prescribed accuracy. Finally, following a seminal proposal by Sabapathy and Winter, we look at data hiding against Gaussian operations assisted by the feedforward of measurement outcomes, providing an example of a relatively simple scheme that works with a single mode only.

TI Autofocusing capabilities of double-ring circular Airy Gaussian beams
   and their application in particle manipulation
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB Focusing is extensively researched in bioimaging, medicine, and quantum computation. However, single focal point and short focal length restrict imaging and optical manipulation at long distances. In this study, we propose what we believe to be a novel method, namely the coherent superposition of double-ring circular Airy Gaussian beams (DR-CAiGBs) to achieve multiple autofocusing over long distances. Without complex structures, theoretical simulations and experimental verifications demonstrate that the DR-CAiGBs can generate multiple autofocusing points along the optical axis, whose positions and quantities can be flexibly adjusted. Furthermore, we demonstrated the two-dimensional (2D) particle manipulation of the DR-CAiGBs by trapping multiple particles at different autofocusing points over 100 mu m. Our research and findings establish new avenues for practical applications in biological cell analysis, particle transportation, and lithography.

TI Spin-dependent signatures of Majorana vortex fusion within planar
   Josephson junctions
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
AB We investigate the magnetic characteristics and tunneling signatures of a planar Josephson junction with Rashba spin-orbit coupling during the fusion of two Majorana vortices. By employing the topological phase diagram and conducting tight-binding simulations of the proposed device, we demonstrate that this fusion process induces a parity-dependent magnetic moment aligned with the junction axis. We further propose a method to probe the spin properties of the fusing Majorana zero modes through spin-resolved Andreev conductance measurements at the junction endpoints. To support our findings, we derive a low-energy effective Hamiltonian that provides a detailed microscopic description of the numerically observed phenomena. Our analysis enables the detection of Majorana fusion outcome from accessible spin current measurements, thus paving the way for future experimental verification and potential applications in topological quantum computation.

TI Efficient adiabatic preparation of tensor network states

AB We propose and study a specific adiabatic path to prepare those tensor network states that are unique ground states of few-body parent Hamiltonians in finite lattices, which include normal tensor network states, as well as other relevant nonnormal states. This path guarantees a gap for finite systems and allows for efficient numerical simulation. In one dimension, we numerically investigate the preparation of a family of states with varying correlation lengths and the one-dimensional Affleck-Kennedy-Lieb-Tasaki (AKLT) state and show that adiabatic preparation can be much faster than standard methods based on sequential preparation. We also apply the method to the two-dimensonal AKLT state on the hexagonal lattice, for which no method based on sequential preparation is known, and show that it can be prepared very efficiently for relatively large lattices.

TI Wide-field imaging of the magnetization process in soft magnetic-thin
   film using diamond quantum sensors
SO APPLIED PHYSICS EXPRESS
AB The magnetization process of a soft magnetic CoFeB-SiO2 thin film was imaged using diamond quantum sensors with perfectly aligned nitrogen-vacancy centers along the [111] direction formed by CVD. Around the film edge, the easy and hard axes directions exhibited different responses to the external magnetic field, consistent with ones observed by magneto-optical Kerr effect microscopy. Moreover, quantum diamond imaging could observe discontinuous magnetization along domain walls as non-uniform magnetic charges (MCs). Quantum diamond imaging would help in visualization through MCs, such as irregularity in the material and relative orientation of magnetizations in neighboring domains.

TI Quantum Circuit Architecture Optimization for Variational Quantum
   Eigensolver via Monto Carlo Tree Search
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON QUANTUM ENGINEERING
AB The advent of noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices provide crucial promise for the development of quantum algorithms. Variational quantum algorithms have emerged as one of the best hopes to utilize NISQ devices. Among these is the famous variational quantum eigensolver (VQE), where one trains a parameterized and fixed quantum circuit (or an ansatz) to accomplish the task. However, VQE also suffers from some serious challenges, which are training difficulty and accuracy reduction due to deep quantum circuit and hardware noise. Motivated by these issues, we propose a runtime and resource-efficient scheme, Monto Carlo tree (MCT) search-based quantum circuit architecture optimization, where the ansatz is built in the variable form. Our approach first models the search space with a MCT and regards it as a supernet, where we make use of layers dependence to reduce the size of the search space. Second, a two-stage scheme is proposed for the search space training, where weight sharing and warm-up strategies are employed to avoid huge computation cost. Training results are stored in nodes of the MCT for future decisions, and hierarchical node selection is presented to obtain an optimal ansatz. As a proof of principle, we carry out a series of numerical experiments for condensed matter and quantum chemistry in a quantum simulator with and without noise. Consequently, our scheme can be efficient to mitigate trainability and accuracy issues by minimizing the ansatz depth and the number of entanglement gates.

TI Chiral current regulation and detection of Berry phase in triangular
   triple quantum dots
SO CHINESE PHYSICS B
AB Based on the hierarchical equations of motion (HEOM) calculation, we theoretically investigate the corresponding control of a triangular triple-quantum-dots (TTQD) ring which is connected to two reservoirs. We initially demonstrate by adding bias voltage and further adjusting the coupling strength between quantum dots, the chiral current induced by bias will go through a transformation of clockwise to counterclockwise direction and an unprecedented effective Hall angle will be triggered. The transformation is very rapid, with a corresponding characteristic time of 80-200 ps. In addition, by adding a magnetic flux to compensate for the chiral current in the original system, we elucidate the relationship between the applied magnetic flux and the Berry phase, which can realize direct measurement of the chiral current and reveal the magnetoelectric coupling relationship.

TI Conservation-Law-Based Global Bounds to Quantum Optimal Control
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB Active control of quantum systems enables diverse applications ranging from quantum computation to manipulation of molecular processes. Maximum speeds and related bounds have been identified from uncertainty principles and related inequalities, but such bounds utilize only coarse system information and loosen significantly in the presence of constraints and complex interaction dynamics. We show that an integral-equation-based formulation of conservation laws in quantum dynamics leads to a systematic framework for identifying fundamental limits to any quantum control scenario. We demonstrate the utility of our bounds in three scenarios-three-level driving, decoherence suppression, and maximum-fidelity gate implementations-and show that in each case our bounds are tight or nearly so. Global bounds complement local-optimization-based designs, illuminating performance levels that may be possible, as well as those that cannot be surpassed.

TI Tunable valley splitting in two-dimensional
   CrBr3/VSe2 van der Waals heterostructure under
   strains and electric fields
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICS-CONDENSED MATTER
AB Valleytronics opens up fascinating opportunities for using the valley degree of freedom in information storage and quantum computation. Here, based on the first-principles calculations, we investigate the effects of biaxial strains and electric fields on the magnetic, electronic, and valleytronic properties of two-dimensional CrBr3/VSe2 van der Waals (vdW) heterostructure consisting of two ferromagnetic monolayers. An interlayer magnetic phase transition from parallel to antiparallel is found when a compressive strain exceeds -2% 2 to the CrBr3 layer. Specifically, a large valley splitting about 30.8 meV is obtained in the system with antiparallel interlayer magnetic configurations under a compressive strain of -4% 3/VSe2 heterostructure. Our findings provide new insights into the future valleytronic applications for two-dimensional magnetic vdW heterostructures.

TI Cooperative effects in thin dielectric layers: Long-range Dicke
   superradiance
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB The realization and control of collective quantum effects so far have predominantly focused on cold atomic ensembles. Quantum photonic platforms, with their engineered Green's functions and integration capability of advanced solid-state quantum emitters, provide opportunities to explore regimes of light-matter interaction beyond the scope of atomic systems. In this work, we demonstrate that embedding quantum emitters within a thin dielectric layer fundamentally alters their collective radiative behavior. The optical modes in the dielectric layer mediate long-range dipole-dipole interactions between emitters, enabling both total and directional superradiance between emitters separated by several wavelengths. Crucially, this mechanism supports Dicke superradiance even in parameter regimes where standard settings fail to support an interaction, unveiling a dimensionalitydriven enhancement of cooperative effects. By bridging many-body quantum optics and photonic engineering, our work reveals a distinct interplay between surrounding dimensionality and collective quantum dynamics. Experimental realization of these predictions, readily achievable in solid-state quantum optics platforms, paves the way for scalable, directional quantum light sources and frontiers in many-body quantum optics.

TI Double Helical Plasmonic Antennas
SO ADVANCED FUNCTIONAL MATERIALS
AB Plasmonic double helical antennas are a means to funnel circularly polarized light down to the nanoscale. Here, an existing design tool for single helices is extended to the case of double helices and used to design antennas that combine large chiroptical interaction strength with highly directional light emission. Full-field numerical modeling underpins the design and provides additional insight into surface charge distributions and resonance widths. The helical antennas are fabricated by direct writing with a focused electron beam, a technique that is unrivaled in terms of spatial resolution and 3D shape fidelity. After the printing process, the structures are purified using ozone plasma at room temperature, resulting in the smallest continuous double helix antennas ever realized in gold. Fabricated antennas are studied regarding their polarization-dependent transmission behavior, which shows a large and broadband dissymmetry factor in the visible range. Since the polarization of light is an important tool for implementing logic functionality in photonic and quantum photonic devices, these helices are potential building blocks for future nanophotonic circuits, but also for chiral metamaterials or phase plates.

TI On-chip generation of single-photon circularly polarized single-mode
   vortex beams
SO SCIENCE ADVANCES
AB Generation of single photons carrying spin and orbital angular momenta (SAM and OAM) opens enticing perspectives for exploiting multiple degrees of freedom for high-dimensional quantum systems. However, on-chip generation of single photons encoded with single-mode SAM-OAM states has been a major challenge. Here, by using carefully designed anisotropic nanodimers fabricated atop a substrate, supporting surface plasmon polariton (SPP) propagation, and accurately positioned around a quantum emitter (QE), we enable nonradiative QE-SPP coupling and the SPP outcoupling into free-space propagating radiation featuring the designed SAM and OAM. We demonstrate on-chip room-temperature generation of well-collimated (divergence < 7.5 degrees) circularly polarized (chirality > 0.97) single-mode vortex beams with different topological charges (l = 0, 1, and 2) and high single-photon purity, g((2))(0) < 0.15. The developed approach can straightforwardly be extended to produce multiple, differently polarized, single-mode single-photon radiation channels and enable thereby realization of high-dimensional quantum sources for advanced quantum photonic technologies.

TI All-Optical Probe of Three-Dimensional Topological Insulators Based on
   High-Harmonic Generation by Circularly Polarized Laser Fields
SO NANO LETTERS
AB We report the observation of an anomalous nonlinear optical response of the prototypical three-dimensional topological insulator bismuth selenide through the process of high-order harmonic generation. We find that the generation efficiency increases as the laser polarization is changed from linear to elliptical, and it becomes maximum for circular polarization. With the aid of a microscopic theory and a detailed analysis of the measured spectra, we reveal that such anomalous enhancement encodes the characteristic topology of the band structure that originates from the interplay of strong spin-orbit coupling and time-reversal symmetry protection. The implications are in ultrafast probing of topological phase transitions, light-field driven dissipationless electronics, and quantum computation.

TI Experimental observation of Berry phases in optical Mobius-strip
   microcavities
SO NATURE PHOTONICS
AB The Mobius strip, a fascinating loop structure with one-sided topology, provides a rich playground for manipulating the non-trivial topological behaviour of spinning particles, such as electrons, polaritons and photons, in both real and parameter spaces. For photons resonating in a Mobius-strip cavity, the occurrence of an extra phase-known as the Berry phase-with purely topological origin is expected due to its non-trivial evolution in parameter space. However, despite numerous theoretical investigations, characterizing the optical Berry phase in a Mobius-strip cavity has remained elusive. Here we report the experimental observation of the Berry phase generated in optical Mobius-strip microcavities. In contrast to theoretical predictions in optical, electronic and magnetic Mobius-topology systems where only Berry phase pi occurs, we demonstrate that a variable Berry phase smaller than pi can be acquired by generating elliptical polarization of resonating light. Mobius-strip microcavities as integrable and Berry-phase-programmable optical systems are of great interest in topological physics and emerging classical or quantum photonic applications.

SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICS A-MATHEMATICAL AND THEORETICAL
AB We develop an algebraic formulation for the discrete quantum harmonic oscillator (DQHO) from the Hamiltonian for two, coupled QHOs and provide a physical picture for the Kravchuk function eigenstates of the oscillator. The familiar su(2) structure of the coupled QHO Hamiltonian divides its spectrum into sets corresponding to the DQHO at different resolutions. In addition to energy ladder operators, the formulation allows for the introduction of resolution ladder operators connecting all DQHOs with different resolutions, thus enabling the dynamic scaling of the resolution of finite degree-of-freedom quantum simulations. The coherent state of the DQHO is constructed, and its expected position is proven to oscillate as a classical harmonic oscillator. The DQHO coherent state recovers that of the quantum harmonic oscillator at large resolution.

TI Millikelvin Nb nanoSQUID-embedded tunable resonator fabricated with a
   neon focused-ion-beam
SO APPLIED PHYSICS LETTERS
AB SQUID-embedded superconducting resonators are of great interest due to their potential for coupling highly scalable superconducting circuits with quantum memories based on solid-state spin ensembles. Such an application requires a high-Q, frequency-tunable resonator that is both resilient to magnetic field and able to operate at millikelvin temperatures. These requirements motivate the use of a higher H-c metal such as niobium; however, the challenge then becomes to sufficiently reduce the operating temperature. We address this by presenting a monolithic Nb nanoSQUID-embedded resonator, where neon focused-ion-beam fabrication of the nanoSQUID results in a device displaying frequency tunability at T=16 mK. In order to assess the applicability of the device for coupling to small spin clusters, we characterize the flux sensitivity as a function of microwave drive power and externally applied magnetic field and find that the noise is dominated by dielectric noise in the resonator. Finally, we discuss improvements to the device design that can dramatically improve the flux sensitivity, which highlights the promise of Nb SQUID-embedded resonators for hybrid superconductor-spin applications.

TI High-Throughput Spectroscopy of Geometry-Tunable Arrays of Axial InGaAs
   Nanowire Heterostructures with Twin-Induced Carrier Confinement
SO NANO LETTERS
AB Predicting the optical properties of large-scale ensembles of luminescent nanowire arrays that host active quantum heterostructures is of paramount interest for on-chip integrated photonic and quantum photonic devices. However, this has remained challenging due to the vast geometrical parameter space and variations at the single object level. Here, we demonstrate high-throughput spectroscopy on 16800 individual InGaAs quantum heterostructures grown by site-selective epitaxy on silicon, with varying geometrical parameters to assess uniformity/yield in luminescence efficiency, and emission energy trends. The luminescence uniformity/yield enhances significantly at prepatterned array mask opening diameters (d 0) greater than 50 nm. Additionally, the emission energy exhibits anomalous behavior with respect to d 0, which is notably attributed to rotational twinning within the InGaAs region, inducing significant energy shifts due to quantum confinement effects. These findings provide useful insights for mapping and optimizing the interdependencies between geometrical parameters and electronic/optical properties of widely tunable sets of quantum nanowire heterostructures.

TI The Quantum JPEG
SO AVS QUANTUM SCIENCE
AB The joint photographic expert group algorithm compresses a digital image by filtering its high spatial-frequency components. Similarly, we introduce a quantum algorithm that uses the quantum Fourier transform to discard the high spatial-frequency qubits of an image, downsampling it to a lower resolution. This allows one to capture, compress, and send images even with limited quantum resources for storage and communication. We show under which conditions this protocol is advantageous with respect to its classical counterpart.

TI Multiqubit quantum state preparation enabled by topology optimization
SO OPTICA QUANTUM
AB Using topology optimization, we inverse-design nanophotonic cavities enabling the preparation of pure states of pairs and triples of quantum emitters. Our devices involve moderate values of the dielectric constant, operate under continuous laser driving, and yield fidelities to the target (Bell and W) states approaching unity for distant qubits (several natural wavelengths apart). In the fidelity optimization procedure, our algorithm generates entanglement by maximizing the dissipative coupling between the emitters, which allows the formation of multipartite pure steady states in the driven-dissipative dynamics of the system. Our findings open the way toward the efficient and fast preparation of multiqubit quantum states with engineered features, with potential applications for nonclassical light generation, and quantum sensing and metrology.

TI Quantifying quantum-amplified metrology via Fisher information
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB We present a unified framework, based on quantum metrology concepts, for defining and quantifying deter-ministic noiseless quantum amplification of parameter-dependent processes, which plays an important role in increasing the precision of quantum sensing. Recent experiments [Burd et al., Science 364, 1163 (2019)] can be encompassed by this concept, which also leads to new suggestions of experimental work. The unified view presented here allows the identification of the basic steps for quantum amplification and of the measurements that lead to the best possible precision, beyond the quantum standard limit, in the estimation of parameters involved in the process. This is applied to the estimation of displacements of trapped ions and of the phase in SU(1,1) optical interferometers and atomic interferometry.

TI Testing Quantum Electrodynamics with Exotic Atoms
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB Precision study of few-electron, high-Z ions is a privileged field for probing high-field, bound-state quantum electrodynamics (BSQED). However, the accuracy of such tests is plagued by nuclear uncertainties, which are often larger than the BSQED effects under investigation. We propose an alternative method with exotic atoms and show that transitions may be found between circular Rydberg states where nuclear contributions are vanishing while BSQED effects remain large. When probed with newly available quantum sensing detectors, these systems offer gains in sensitivity of 1 to 2 orders of magnitude, while the mean electric field largely exceeds the Schwinger limit.

TI Modular nanophotonic design of an on-chip quantum dot single-photon
   source with waveguided resonant optical excitation
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB A key element for on-chip quantum photonic systems is a reliable source of on-demand, indistinguishable, waveguided single photons that can be seamlessly integrated with photonic circuits. While epitaxial semiconductor quantum dots have the potential to fulfill such needs, optical excitation that is resonant with the quantum dot ensures maximum single-photon indistinguishability. To date, a majority of waveguided quantum dot sources that allowed resonant excitation have relied on free-space excitation beams. Free-space excitation requires significant experimental overhead, especially if multiple sources need to be addressed. waveguided resonant excitation, in contrast, has not been extensively explored, and yet enables simplified, plug-and-play operation of single and even multiple sources on chip. Here, we show design steps for what we believe to be a novel, modular nanophotonic structure that, relying on inversely designed components, allows waveguided resonant quantum dot excitation with high single-photon waveguide collection efficiencies (> 85 %) and low multi-photon probability (<10(-3)), many favorable trade-off possibilities, and reasonable robustness to quantum dot positioning.

TI Entanglement-invertible channels
SO JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICAL PHYSICS
AB In a well-known result [R. Werner, J. Phys. A: Math. Gen. 34(35), 7081 (2001)], Werner classified all tight quantum teleportation and dense coding schemes, showing that they correspond to unitary error bases. Here tightness is a certain dimensional restriction: the quantum system to be teleported and the entangled resource must be of dimension d, and the measurement must have d(2) outcomes. Here we generalise this classification so as to remove the dimensional restriction altogether, thereby resolving an open problem raised in that work. In fact, we classify not just teleportation and dense coding schemes, but entanglement-reversible channels. These are channels between finite-dimensional C*-algebras which are reversible with the aid of an entangled resource state, generalising ordinary reversibility of a channel. We show that such channels correspond to families of linear maps which are bi-isometric with respect to a duality defined by the resource state. In particular, in Werner's classification, a bijective correspondence between tight teleportation and dense coding schemes was shown: swapping Alice and Bob's operations turns a teleportation scheme into a dense coding scheme and vice versa. We observe that this property generalises ordinary invertibility of a channel; we call it entanglement-invertibility. We show that entanglement-invertible channels are precisely the quantum bijections previously studied in noncommutative topology [B. Musto et al., J. Math. Phys. 59(8), 081706 (2018)], and therefore admit a classification in terms of Wang's quantum permutation group [S. Wang, Commun. Math. Phys. 195, 195-211 (1998)]. (c) 2024 Author(s).

TI Boson Sampling Enhanced Quantum Chemistry
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB In this work, we give a hybrid quantum-classical algorithm for solving electronic structure problems of molecules using only linear quantum optical systems. The variational ansatz we proposed is a hybrid of noninteracting boson dynamics and classical computational chemistry methods, specifically, the Hartree-Fock method and the configuration interaction method. The boson part is built by a linear optical interferometer, which is easier to realize compared with the well-known unitary coupled cluster (UCC) ansatz composed of quantum gates in conventional variational quantum eigensolver, and the classical part is merely classical processing acting on the Hamiltonian. The appearance of permanents in the boson part has its physical intuition to provide different kinds of resources from commonly used single, double, and higher excitations in classical methods and the UCC ansatz to explore chemical quantum states. Such resources can help enhance the accuracy of methods used in the classical parts. We give a scalable hybrid homodyne and photon-number measurement procedure for evaluating the energy value, which has intrinsic abilities to mitigate photon loss errors, and discuss the extra measurement cost induced by the no Pauli exclusion principle for bosons with its solutions. To demonstrate our proposal, we run numerical experiments on several molecules and obtain their potential energy curves reaching chemical accuracy.

TI Dissipative quantum many-body dynamics in (1+1)D quantum cellular
   automata and quantum neural networks
SO NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB Classical artificial neural networks, built from elementary units, possess enormous expressive power. Here we investigate a quantum neural network (QNN) architecture, which follows a similar paradigm. It is structurally equivalent to so-called (1+1)D quantum cellular automata, which are two-dimensional quantum lattice systems on which dynamics takes place in discrete time. Information transfer between consecutive time slices-or adjacent network layers-is governed by local quantum gates, which can be regarded as the quantum counterpart of the classical elementary units. Along the time-direction an effective dissipative evolution emerges on the level of the reduced state, and the nature of this dynamics is dictated by the structure of the elementary gates. We show how to construct the local unitary gates to yield a desired many-body dynamics, which in certain parameter regimes is governed by a Lindblad master equation. We study this for small system sizes through numerical simulations and demonstrate how collective effects within the quantum cellular automaton can be controlled parametrically. Our study constitutes a step towards the utilization of large-scale emergent phenomena in large QNNs for machine learning purposes.

TI Ferroelectric compute-in-memory annealer for combinatorial optimization
   problems
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Computationally hard combinatorial optimization problems (COPs) are ubiquitous in many applications. Various digital annealers, dynamical Ising machines, and quantum/photonic systems have been developed for solving COPs, but they still suffer from the memory access issue, scalability, restricted applicability to certain types of COPs, and VLSI-incompatibility, respectively. Here we report a ferroelectric field effect transistor (FeFET) based compute-in-memory (CiM) annealer for solving larger-scale COPs efficiently. Our CiM annealer converts COPs into quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO) formulations, and uniquely accelerates in-situ the core vector-matrix-vector (VMV) multiplication operations of QUBO formulations in a single step. Specifically, the three-terminal FeFET structure allows for lossless compression of the stored QUBO matrix, achieving a remarkably 75% chip size saving when solving Max-Cut problems. A multi-epoch simulated annealing (MESA) algorithm is proposed for efficient annealing, achieving up to 27% better solution and similar to 2X speedup than conventional simulated annealing. Experimental validation is performed using the first integrated FeFET chip on 28nm HKMG CMOS technology, indicating great promise of FeFET CiM array in solving general COPs.

TI Observation of dynamic nuclear polarization echoes
SO SCIENCE ADVANCES
AB It is demonstrated that the time evolution of the electron-nuclear polarization transfer process during pulsed dynamic nuclear polarization (DNP) can be reversed on a microsecond timescale, leading to the observation of DNP echoes. The DNP echoes are induced by consecutive application of two pulse trains that produce effective Hamiltonians that differ only in the sign of the effective hyperfine coupling. The experiments have been performed on a frozen solution of trityl radicals in water/glycerol on a homebuilt X-band electron paramagnetic resonance/DNP spectrometer at 80 kelvins. We envisage that DNP echoes will play an important role in future development of pulsed DNP for sensitivity-enhanced nuclear magnetic resonance, hyperfine spectroscopy, and quantum sensing.

TI Optomechanical squeezing with strong harmonic mechanical driving
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB In this paper, we propose an optomechanical scheme for generating mechanical squeezing over the 3 dB limit, with the mechanical mirror being driven by a strong and linear harmonic force. In contrast to parametric mechanical driving, the linearly driven force shakes the mechanical mirror periodically oscillating at twice the mechanical eigenfrequency with large amplitude, where the mechanical mirror can be dissipatively stabilized by the engineered cavity reservoir to a dynamical squeezed steady state with a maximum degree of squeezing over 8 dB. The mechanical squeezing of more than 3 dB can be achieved even for a mechanical thermal temperature larger than 100 mK. The scheme can be implemented in a cascaded optomechanical setup, with potential applications in engineering continuous variable entanglement and quantum sensing.

TI High-Precision Wavelength Tuning of GeSn Nanobeam Lasers via Dynamically
   Controlled Strain Engineering
SO ADVANCED SCIENCE
AB The technology to develop a large number of identical coherent light sources on an integrated photonics platform holds the key to the realization of scalable optical and quantum photonic circuits. Herein, a scalable technique is presented to produce identical on-chip lasers by dynamically controlled strain engineering. By using localized laser annealing that can control the strain in the laser gain medium, the emission wavelengths of several GeSn one-dimensional photonic crystal nanobeam lasers are precisely matched whose initial emission wavelengths are significantly varied. The method changes the GeSn crystal structure in a region far away from the gain medium by inducing Sn segregation in a dynamically controllable manner, enabling the emission wavelength tuning of more than 10 nm without degrading the laser emission properties such as intensity and linewidth. The authors believe that the work presents a new possibility to scale up the number of identical light sources for the realization of large-scale photonic-integrated circuits.

TI A low-loss zero-index photonic crystal slab based on toroidal dipole
   mode
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB Zero-index medium has profound application for light manipulation. Certain types of dielectric photonic crystals (PCs) may have zero effective index since they form Dirac cone at the G point of their band structure. Although zero index photonic crystals provide a solution to impedance mismatch in photonic integrated circuits, its propagation modes strongly radiate to the surrounding environment, which hampers their application for high-density integration. In this paper, by an appropriate design of PC's unit cell, toroidal dipole mode is excited at Dirac-point frequency through coupled Mie resonance to suppress radiative losses of other multipoles. The PCs with the Dirac-like dispersion at the G point can be mapped to an effective zero-index medium. The physical mechanism was utterly investigated by means of multipole decomposition and band structure analysis. Due to the non-radiation property of the toroidal dipole mode, the proposed photonic crystal slab process is low-loss based on numerical simulation. Moreover, its relatively simple design facilitates integration with future quantum photonic devices. (C) 2022 Optica Publishing Group under the terms of the Optica Open Access Publishing Agreement

We show that our approach enhances performance of superconducting qubits and enables higher information gain without compromising dynamical range, paving the way toward achieving the Heisenberg limit. Combining adaptive algorithms with device-specific calibration, our methods bridge the gap between theoretical advancements and practical quantum sensing applications, offering a powerful framework for metrology using superconducting qubits.

AB Quantum sensors based on atom interferometers can provide measurements of inertial quantities with unprecedented accuracy and precision. It has been suggested that this sea change in sensing could provide an inertial navigation capability that is comparable with current satellite based navigation systems. However, the accuracy of sensor measurements is not the only factor that limits the accuracy of inertial navigation systems. In this paper, we explore the fundamental limits to inertial navigation, and explain how quantum inertial sensors could be used to alleviate some of the problems encountered in current classical inertial navigation systems, but not to solve the fundamental instability inherent in inertial navigation methods.

Due to the naturally occurring background radiation, the photon emitted toward potential targets more appropriately lies in the microwave region. Here, we propose a hybrid quantum source based on cavity magnonics for microwave QI, where the medium that bridges the optical and the microwave modes is magnon, the quanta of spin wave. Within experimentally accessible parameters, significant microwave-optical quantum resources of interest can be generated, leading to orders of magnitude lower detecting error probability compared with the electro-optomechanical prototype quantum radar and any classical microwave radar with equal transmitted energy.

TI Photon conversion in thin-film lithium niobate nanowaveguides: a noise
   analysis
SO JOURNAL OF THE OPTICAL SOCIETY OF AMERICA B-OPTICAL PHYSICS
AB Wavelength transduction of single-photon signals is indispensable to networked quantum applications, particularly those incorporating quantum memories. Lithium niobate nanophotonic devices have demonstrated favorable linear, nonlinear, and electro-optical properties to deliver this crucial function while offering superior efficiency, integrability, and scalability. Yet, their quantum noise level-a crucial metric for any single-photon-based application-has yet to be investigated. In this work, we report the first, to the best of our knowledge, study with the focus on telecom to near-visible conversion driven by a small detuned telecom pump for practical considerations in distributed quantum processing over fiber networks. Our results find the noise level to be on the order of 10(-4) photons per time-frequency mode for high conversion, allowing faithful pulsed operations. Through carefully analyzing the origins of such noise and each's dependence on the pump power and wavelength detuning, we have also identified a formula for noise suppression to 10(-5) photons per mode. Our results assert a viable, low-cost, and modular approach to networked quantum processing and beyond using lithium niobate nanophotonics. (C) 2021 Optical Society of America

TI Quantum HodgeRank: Topology-based rank aggregation on quantum computers
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW APPLIED
AB HodgeRank generalizes ranking algorithms, such as Google's PageRank, to rank alternatives based on real-world (often incomplete) data using graphs and discrete exterior calculus. It analyzes multipartite interactions on high-dimensional networks with a complexity that scales exponentially with dimension. We develop a quantum algorithm that approximates the HodgeRank solution with complexity independent of dimension. Our algorithm extracts relevant information from the state such as the ranking consistency, which achieves a superpolynomial speedup over similar classical methods.

TI Parity-time symmetry and coherent perfect absorption in a cooperative
   atom response
SO NANOPHOTONICS
AB Parity-Time (PT) symmetry has become an important concept in the design of synthetic optical materials, with exotic functionalities such as unidirectional transport and nonreciprocal reflection. At exceptional points, this symmetry is spontaneously broken, and solutions transition from those with conserved intensity to exponential growth or decay. Here, we analyze a quantum-photonic surface formed by a single layer of atoms in an array with light mediating strong cooperative many-body interactions. We show how delocalized collective excitation eigenmodes can exhibit an effective PT symmetry and nonexponential decay. This effective symmetry is achieved in a passive system without gain by balancing the scattering of a bright mode with the loss from a subradiant dark mode. These modes coalesce at exceptional points, evidenced by the emergence of coherent perfect absorption where coherent incoming light is perfectly absorbed and scattered only incoherently. We also show how PT symmetry can be generated in total reflection and by balancing scattering and loss between different polarizations of collective modes.

TI Dual-resonance enhanced quantum light-matter interactions in
   deterministically coupled quantum-dot-micropillars
SO LIGHT-SCIENCE & APPLICATIONS
AB Optical microcavities have widely been employed to enhance either the optical excitation or the photon emission processes for boosting light-matter interactions at the nanoscale. When both the excitation and emission processes are simultaneously facilitated by the optical resonances provided by the microcavities, as referred to the dual-resonance condition in this article, the performances of many nanophotonic devices approach to the optima. In this work, we present versatile accessing of dual-resonance conditions in deterministically coupled quantum-dot (QD)-micropillars, which enables emission from neutral exciton (X)-charged exciton (CX) transition with improved single-photon purity. In addition, the rarely observed up-converted single-photon emission process is achieved under dual-resonance conditions. We further exploit the vectorial nature of the high-order cavity modes to significantly improve the excitation efficiency under the dual-resonance condition. The dual-resonance enhanced light-matter interactions in the quantum regime provide a viable path for developing integrated quantum photonic devices based on cavity quantum electrodynamics (QED) effect, e.g., highly efficient quantum light sources and quantum logical gates.

TI Improving magnetic-field resilience of NbTiN planar resonators using a

SO APPLIED PHYSICS LETTERS
AB High-quality factor microwave resonators operating in a magnetic field are a necessity for some quantum sensing applications and hybrid platforms. Losses in microwave superconducting resonators can have several origins, including microscopic defects, usually known as two-level-systems. Here, we characterize the magnetic field response of NbTiN resonators patterned on sapphire and observe clear absorption lines occurring at specific magnetic fields. We identify the spin systems responsible for these features, including a yet unreported spin with g = 1.85 that we attribute to defects in the NbTiN thin film. We develop mitigation strategies involving, namely, an aluminum etch mask, resulting in maintaining quality factors above Q > 2 x 10( 5) in the range of 0-0.3 T.

TI Quantum generative model for sampling many-body spectral functions
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
AB Quantum phase estimation is at the heart of most quantum algorithms with exponential speedup. In this paper we demonstrate how to utilize it to compute the dynamical response functions of many-body quantum systems. Specifically, we design a circuit that acts as an efficient quantum generative model, providing samples out of the spectral function of high rank observables in polynomial time. This includes many experimentally relevant spectra such as the dynamic structure factor, the optical conductivity, or the NMR spectrum. Experimental realization of the algorithm, apart from logarithmic overhead, requires doubling the number of qubits as compared to a simple analog simulator.

TI Selective enriching of trionic emission in a WS2-ZnO hybrid
   through type-II band alignment
SO SCIENCE CHINA-INFORMATION SCIENCES
AB Strategies to modulate the exciton dynamics in ultrathin two-dimensional (2D) semiconductors have always been an integral component in the bid towards improved optoelectronics and quantum photonic devices. The capability to non-destructively tune the relaxation dynamics, valley polarization, binding energies, and population ratio of various excitonic species has been well-sought for advanced applications. Through the rationale design of a WS2-ZnO hybrid platform, we present a distinct increment in the trion-to-exciton ratio for WS2 emission across a patterned heterostructure. The shift in dominant excitonic species arose due to the efficient charge segregation at the spatially confined interface of the type-II heterostructure. Owing to the charge transfer process, the resultant emission profile presents up to four times amplification in the trion-to-exciton ratio, with temperature variable trion binding energies up to 59 meV. Since trions possess non-zero charge and spin degrees of freedom, the provision of a higher density of trions with increased binding stability would encourage new opportunities for reproducible optoelectronics and quantum emitters.

TI Diameter-dependent whispering gallery mode lasing effects in quantum dot
   micropillar cavities
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB Whispering gallery mode (WGM) based microlasers have gained significant interest across various fields of nanophotonics, including biosensing, metrology, and on-chip excitation of single quantum dots in integrated quantum photonic structures. In this study, we report a comprehensive diameter-dependent study of whispering gallery mode lasing in quantum dot micropillar cavities. The lasing threshold, mode energy, quality factor, light-matter interaction in terms of the Purcell factor, and the free spectral range, are studied systematically for diameters ranging from 1 to 20 mu m at cryogenic temperatures. To describe the experimental data, we use rate equation fitting and numerical simulations based on the finite element method, including realistic loss channels. Our results show a strong and systematic dependence of all lasing properties on the diameter of the micropillars. We also observe significant variations in the lasing properties of nominally identical micropillars, indicating a significant influence of the growth and fabrication imperfections on the output of the devices. The study provides important information on the optical properties of micropillar-based WGM lasing, which can aid in the advancement of optoelectronic applications using these nanophotonic structures.

TI Entangled States from Sparsely Coupled Spins for Metrology with Neutral
   Atoms
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB Quantum states featuring extensive multipartite entanglement are a resource for quantum-enhanced metrology, with sensitivity up to the Heisenberg limit. However, robust generation of these states using unitary dynamics typically requires all-to-all interactions among particles. Here, we demonstrate that optimal states for quantum sensing can be generated with sparse interaction graphs featuring only a logarithmic number of couplings per particle. We show that specific sparse graphs with long-range interactions can approximate the dynamics of all-to-all spin models, such as the one-axis twisting model, even for large system sizes. The resulting sparse coupling graphs and protocol can also be efficiently implemented using dynamic reconfiguration of atoms in optical tweezers.

Here, we study the time-reversal protocol that has been proposed to sense small displacements of the light field, and report the sensitivity of the scheme that could be speeded up to attain the Heisenberg limit (HL). We show the holonomic unitary parametrization process of the scheme and one only need to choose appropriate initial states to pursue the ultimate sensitivity.

TI Cavity-Enhanced 2D Material Quantum Emitters Deterministically
   Integrated with Silicon Nitride Microresonators
SO NANO LETTERS
AB Optically active defects in 2D materials, such as hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) and transition-metal dichalcogenides (TMDs), are an attractive class of single-photon emitters with high brightness, operation up to room temperature, site-specific engineering of emitter arrays with strain and irradiation techniques, and tunability with external electric fields. In this work, we demonstrate a novel approach to precisely align and embed hBN and TMDs within background-free silicon nitride microring resonators. Through the Purcell effect, high-purity hBN emitters exhibit a cavity-enhanced spectral coupling efficiency of up to 46% at room temperature, exceeding the theoretical limit (up to 40%) for cavity-free waveguide-emitter coupling and demonstrating nearly a 1 order of magnitude improvement over previous work. The devices are fabricated with a CMOS-compatible process and exhibit no degradation of the 2D material optical properties, robustness to thermal annealing, and 100 nm positioning accuracy of quantum emitters within single -mode waveguides, opening a path for scalable quantum photonic chips with on-demand single-photon sources.

TI Orbital-optimized pair-correlated electron simulations on trapped-ion
   quantum computers
SO NPJ QUANTUM INFORMATION
AB Variational quantum eigensolvers (VQE) are among the most promising approaches for solving electronic structure problems on near-term quantum computers. A critical challenge for VQE in practice is that one needs to strike a balance between the expressivity of the VQE ansatz versus the number of quantum gates required to implement the ansatz, given the reality of noisy quantum operations on near-term quantum computers. In this work, we consider an orbital-optimized pair-correlated approximation to the unitary coupled cluster with singles and doubles (uCCSD) ansatz and report a highly efficient quantum circuit implementation for trapped-ion architectures. We show that orbital optimization can recover significant additional electron correlation energy without sacrificing efficiency through measurements of low-order reduced density matrices (RDMs). In the dissociation of small molecules, the method gives qualitatively accurate predictions in the strongly-correlated regime when running on noise-free quantum simulators. On IonQ's Harmony and Aria trapped-ion quantum computers, we run end-to-end VQE algorithms with up to 12 qubits and 72 variational parameters-the largest full VQE simulation with a correlated wave function on quantum hardware. We find that even without error mitigation techniques, the predicted relative energies across different molecular geometries are in excellent agreement with noise-free simulators.

Using exact analytical techniques and extensive numerical simulations based on Clifford replica tensor networks, we demonstrate that random Clifford circuits fully anticoncentrate in logarithmic circuit depth; namely, higher-order moments of the overlap distribution converge to those of random stabilizer states. Moreover, we investigate the effect of introducing a controlled number of non-Clifford (magic) resources into Clifford circuits. We show that inserting a polylogarithmic in qudit number of T states is sufficient to drive the overlap distribution toward the Porter-Thomas statistics, effectively recovering full quantum randomness. In short, this fact presents doped tensor networks and shallow Clifford circuits as pseudomagic quantum states. Our results clarify the interplay between Clifford dynamics, magic-state injection, and quantum complexity, with implications for quantum circuit sampling, many-body quantum physics, and the benchmarking of quantum computational advantage.

TI Quantum attacks on Sum of Even-Mansour pseudorandom functions
SO INFORMATION PROCESSING LETTERS
AB At CRYPTO 2019, constructions of a pseudorandom function from public random permutations were presented. We consider one of the constructions called Sum of Even-Mansour (SoEM), and present quantum attacks against the construction. Our attacks are based on two quantum algorithms, Simon's algorithm and Grover's algorithm, and derive the secret key. We also present quantum attacks against natural variants of SoEM.

TI Krylov complexity is not a measure of distance between states or
   operators
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW D
AB We ask whether Krylov complexity is mutually compatible with the circuit and Nielsen definitions of complexity. We show that the Krylov complexities between three states fail to satisfy the triangle inequality and so cannot be a measure of distance: there is no possible metric for which Krylov complexity is the length of the shortest path to the target state or operator. We show this explicitly in the simplest example, a single qubit, and in general.

TI Algorithmic Error Mitigation Scheme for Current Quantum Processors
SO QUANTUM
AB We present a hardware agnostic error mitigation algorithm for near term quantum processors inspired by the classical Lanczos method. This technique can reduce the impact of different sources of noise at the sole cost of an increase in the number of measurements to be performed on the target quantum circuit, without additional experimental overhead. We demonstrate through numerical simulations and experiments on IBM Quantum hardware that the proposed scheme significantly increases the accuracy of cost functions evaluations within the framework of variational quantum algorithms, thus leading to improved ground state calculations for quantum chemistry and physics problems beyond state-of-the-art results.

TI Design of asymmetric transmission of photonic crystal heterostructure
   based on two-dimensional hexagonal boron nitride material
SO ACTA PHYSICA SINICA
AB Two-dimensional (2D) hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) possesses many unique properties such as high mechanical strength and excellent chemical and thermal stability. The 2D hBN exhibits a wide bandgap in the UV region and optically-stable ultra-bright quantum emitters that make hBN a promising nanophotonic platform for quantum computing and information processing, especially in the visible wavelength range. Therefore, it is greatly important to build up different nanophotonic devices with different functionalities based on this material platform to achieve the integrated photonic chips. Among the devices, the integratable optical asymmetric transmission devices are important elements for functional quantum computing chips. Since hBN is a dielectric material, photonic crystal (PhC) structure is the most suitable in principle and allows on-chip integration with other photonic devices. In this study, we theoretically design an asymmetric transmission device based on 2D hBN PhC heterostructures in the visible wavelength range for the first time. Due to the relatively low refractive index of 2D hBN material (n < 2.4), we design a free-standing hBN PhC heterostructure to maximize the light trapping in the structure and minimize the propagation loss. The asymmetric transmission device is composed of two square-lattice 2D PhC structures, namely PhC 1 and PhC 2. We use the plane wave expansion method (PWM) to calculate the iso-frequency contours (EFCs) of the PhC structures to study the light propagation inside of the PhCs, which will propagate along the gradient of direction of the EFCs. We design the PhC structure in the way that the incident light beams from different angles can be self-collimated along the Gamma-X direction of the PhC 2 and coupled out. On the other hand, the backward incident light is blocked by the bandgaps of PhC 2. In this way, asymmetric optical transmission is achieved with high forward transmittance and contrast ratio. In addition, we further finely tune the structural parameters, including the lattice constant and column radius of the PhCs to optimize the performance by using the finite difference time domain (FDTD) method. The resulting 2D hBN PhC heterostructure achieves an asymmetric transmission in a wavelength range of 610-684 nm with a peak forward transmittance of 0.65 at a wavelength of 652 nm. Meanwhile, the backward transmittance is controlled to be 0.04. As a result, the contrast ratio can reach up to 0.95. The working bandwidth of the hBN PhC is 74 nm (T-F > 0.5). In addition, the designed asymmetric transmission device has a small size of 11 mu m x 11 mu m, thus it is suitable for on-chip integration. Our results open up possibilities for designing new nanophotonic devices based on 2D hBN material for quantum computing and information processing. The design principle can be generally used to design other photonic devices based on 2D hBN material.

TI Digital Homodyne and Heterodyne Detection for Stationary Bosonic Modes
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB Homo- and heterodyne detection are fundamental techniques for measuring propagating electromagnetic fields. However, applying these techniques to stationary fields confined in cavities poses a challenge. As a way to overcome this challenge, we propose to use repeated indirect measurements of a two-level system interacting with the cavity. We demonstrate numerically that the proposed measurement scheme faithfully reproduces measurement statistics of homo- or heterodyne detection. The scheme can be implemented in various physical architectures, including circuit quantum electrodynamics. Our results pave the way for implementation of quantum algorithms requiring linear detection of stationary modes, including quantum verification protocols.

TI Higher-order topological biphoton corner states in two-dimensional
   photonic lattices
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Higher-order topological insulators have attracted great interest for their unconventional bulk-boundary correspondence especially gapless corner states. Here, we realize topological biphoton corner states in two-dimensional lattices. In addition to the striking state localization, the correlations in topologically nontrivial cases are more than 60 times higher than those in trivial cases and the visibility of Hong-Ou-Mandel interference for output topological corner-entangled states is higher than 90.3%. We confirm that the second-order photonic topological insulators support stable biphoton states that can maintain spatial distributions in high-dimensional Hilbert space, which have potential applications in quantum algorithms, simulation, and computation.

TI Computing n-Time Correlation Functions without Ancilla Qubits
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB The n-time correlation function is pivotal for establishing connections between theoretical predictions and experimental observations of a quantum system. Conventional methods for computing n-time correlation functions on quantum computers, such as the Hadamard test, generally require an ancilla qubit that controls the entire system-an approach that poses challenges for digital quantum devices with limited qubit connectivity, as well as for analog quantum platforms lacking controlled operations. Here, we introduce a method to compute n-time correlation functions using only unitary evolutions on the system of interest, thereby eliminating the need for ancillas and the control operations. This approach substantially relaxes hardware connectivity requirements for digital processors and enables more practical measurements of n-time correlation functions on analog platforms. We demonstrate our protocol on IBM quantum hardware up to 12 qubits to measure the single-particle spectrum of the Schwinger model and the out-oftime-order correlator in the transverse-field Ising model. In the demonstration, we further introduce an error mitigation procedure based on signal processing that integrates signal filtering and correlation analysis, and successfully reproduces the noiseless simulation results from the noisy hardware. Our Letter highlights a route to exploring complex quantum many-body correlation functions in practice, even in the presence of realistic hardware limitations and noise.

TI Experimental Liouvillian exceptional points in a quantum system without
   Hamiltonian singularities
SO NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB Hamiltonian exceptional points (HEPs) are spectral degeneracies of non-Hermitian Hamiltonians describing classical and semiclassical open systems with losses and/or gain. However, this definition overlooks the occurrence of quantum jumps in the evolution of open quantum systems. These quantum effects are properly accounted for by considering quantum Liouvillians and their exceptional points (LEPs). Specifically, an LEP corresponds to the coalescence of two or more eigenvalues and the corresponding eigenmatrices of a given Liouvillian at critical values of external parameters (Minganti et al 2019 Phys. Rev. A 100 062131). Here, we explicitly describe how standard quantum process tomography, which reveals the dynamics of a quantum system, can be readily applied to detect and characterize quantum LEPs of quantum non-Hermitian systems. We conducted experiments on an IBM quantum processor to implement a prototype model with one-, two-, and three qubits simulating the decay of a single qubit through competing channels, resulting in LEPs but not HEPs. Subsequently, we performed tomographic reconstruction of the corresponding experimental Liouvillian and its LEPs using both single- and two-qubit operations. This example underscores the efficacy of process tomography in tuning and observing LEPs even in the absence of HEPs.

TI Relationship between Information Scrambling and Quantum Darwinism
SO ENTROPY
AB A quantum system interacting with a multipartite environment can induce redundant encoding of the information of a system into the environment, which is the essence of quantum Darwinism. At the same time, the environment may scramble the initially localized information about the system. Based on a collision model, we mainly investigate the relationship between information scrambling in an environment and the emergence of quantum Darwinism. Our results show that when the mutual information between the system and environmental fragment is a linear increasing function of the fragment size, the tripartite mutual information (TMI) is zero, which can be proved generally beyond the collision model; when the system exhibits Darwinistic behavior, the TMI is positive (i.e., scrambling does not occur); when we see the behavior of an "encoding" environment, the TMI is negative (i.e., scrambling occurs). Additionally, we give a physical explanation for the above results by considering two simple but illustrative examples. Moreover, depending on the nature of system and environment interactions, it is also shown that the single qubit and two-qubit systems behave differently for the emergence of quantum Darwinism, and hence the scrambling, while their relationship is consistent with the above conclusion.

TI Heterogeneously-integrated lasers on thin film lithium niobate
SO NANOPHOTONICS
AB We demonstrate a versatile heterogeneous integration platform unifying III-V gain with thin-film lithium niobate (TFLN) photonic circuits to create high-performance lasers with integrated functionality. This breakthrough overcomes the critical barrier to fully integrated photonic systems by combining optical gain, low-loss cavities, and phase control on a single chip. We present two distinct laser architectures: a distributed feedback laser achieving 11.0 kHz intrinsic linewidth and 4.0 mW in-fiber power through self-injection locking to a high-Q TFLN resonator, and a Vernier ring laser exhibiting 44 nm continuous tuning range with > 40 dB side-mode suppression ratio. Crucially, the heterogeneous integration of the gain section with TFLN's components provides a promising path to implementing direct intracavity modulation, which is a functionality that typically requires discrete components. This inherent capability makes our platform a foundational advancement for future compact, robust systems in coherent communications, ultrafast optical metrology, quantum photonic processors, and microwave photonic systems operating at GHz bandwidths, marking a significant advancement toward complete photonic system integration.

TI Interplay of charge noise and coupling to phonons in adiabatic electron
   transfer between quantum dots
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
AB Long-distance transfer of quantum information in architectures based on quantum dot spin qubits will be necessary for their scalability. One way of achieving this goal is to simply move the electron between two quantum registers. Precise control over the process of shuttling such a single electron through a chain of tunnel-coupled quantum dots is possible when interdot energy detunings are changed adiabatically. The deterministic character of shuttling is, however, endangered by the open nature of the system, as the transferred electron is coupled to thermal reservoirs: sources of fluctuations of electric fields and lattice vibrations. We present a comprehensive analysis showing how the electron transfer between two voltage-controlled quantum dots is affected by electron-phonon scattering and interaction with sources of 1/f and Johnson charge noise in both detuning and tunnel coupling. The electron-phonon scattering turns out to be irrelevant in Si quantum dots, with charge noise dominating the dynamics of the system at slow detuning sweep, when the electron spends more time delocalized between the dots (i.e., near the anticrossing of the tunnel-coupled states). Competition between the effects of charge noise and the Landau-Zener effect leads to an existence of an optimal detuning sweep rate, leading to minimal probability of leaving the electron behind. In GaAs quantum dots, on the other hand, piezoelectric coupling to phonons is strong enough to make the processes of interdot transfer assisted by phonon emission and absorption dominate over transitions caused by charge noise. The probability of leaving the electron behind then depends monotonically on detuning the sweep rate over a broad range of rates, and values much smaller than in silicon can be obtained for slow sweeps. However, after taking into account limitations on transfer time imposed by the need for preservation of a shuttled electron's spin coherence, the minimal probabilities of leaving the electron behind in both GaAs- and Si-based double quantum dots turn out to be of the same order of magnitude. Bringing them down below 10(-3) requires temperatures <= 100 mK and tunnel couplings above 20 mu eV.

TI Entanglement detection in quantum many-body systems using entropic
   uncertainty relations
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB We study experimentally accessible lower bounds on entanglement measures based on entropic uncertainty relations. Experimentally quantifying entanglement is highly desired for applications of quantum simulation experiments to fundamental questions, e.g., in quantum statistical mechanics and condensed-matter physics. At the same time it poses a significant challenge because the evaluation of entanglement measures typically requires the full reconstruction of the quantum state, which is extremely costly in terms of measurement statistics. We derive an improved entanglement bound for bipartite systems, which requires measuring joint probability distributions in only two different measurement settings per subsystem, and demonstrate its power by applying it to currently operational experimental setups for quantum simulation with cold atoms. Examining the tightness of the derived entanglement bound, we find that the set of pure states for which our relation is tight is strongly restricted. We show that, for measurements in mutually unbiased bases, the only pure states that saturate the bound are maximally entangled states on a subspace of the bipartite Hilbert space (this includes product states). We further show that our relation can also be employed for entanglement detection using generalized measurements, i.e., when not all measurement outcomes can be resolved individually by the detector. In addition, the impact of local conserved quantities on the detectable entanglement is discussed.

TI An Efficient Variant of Pollard's p-1 for the Case That All Prime
   Factors of the p-1 in B-Smooth
SO SYMMETRY-BASEL
AB Due to the computational limitations at present, there is no efficient integer factorization algorithm that can break at least 2048 bits of RSA with strong prime factors in polynomial time. Although Shor's algorithm based on a quantum computer has been presented, the quantum computer is still in its early stages of the development. As a result, the integer factorization problem (IFP) is a technique that is still being refined. Pollard's p - 1 is an integer factorization algorithm based on all prime factors of p - 1 or q - 1, where p and q are two distinct prime factors of modulus. In fact, Pollard's p - 1 is an efficient method when all prime factors of p - 1 or q - 1 are small. The aim of this paper is to propose a variant of Pollard's p - 1 in order to decrease the computation time. In general, the proposed method is very efficient when all prime factors of p - 1 or q - 1 are the members of B-smooth. Assuming this condition exists, the experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method is approximately 80 to 90 percent faster than Pollard's p - 1. Furthermore, the proposed technique is still faster than Pollard's p - 1 for some values of modulus in which at least one integer is a prime factor of p - 1 or q - 1 while it is not a member of B-smooth. In addition, it is demonstrated that the proposed method's best-case running time is O(x),where x is represented as bits length of root n.

TI Quantum features for a system of two qutrits in the presence of
   power-law potential field
SO ALEXANDRIA ENGINEERING JOURNAL
AB In this article, we present a quantum model of the two-qutrit (T-Q) in the Lambda- type configuration interacting with a field mode initially in a coherent state of power lower potential. We analyze the dynamical characteristics of this quantum system, taking into account the influences of both the T-Q initial state and the field parameters. We investigate the entanglement between the T-Q and field, the Q-Q state entanglement, as well as the T-Q quantum coherence. We quantify the nonclassical properties of the power lower potential field based on the evolution of the Mandel parameter. The effects of power lower potential parameters on the evolution of quantum measures such as negativity, quantum coherence, von Neumann entropy, and the Mandel parameter are analyzed when the T-Q are initially in the upper and Bell states. Our findings indicate that the system exhibits a quasi-periodic occurrence of maximum entanglement and coherence when the T-Q are initially in the Bell state.

TI Noise effects on the Wilczek-Zee geometric phase
SO JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICAL PHYSICS
AB Non-Abelian geometric phases have been proposed as an essential ingredient in logical gate implementation-their geometric nature guarantees their invariance under reparameterizations of the associated cyclic path in parameter space. However, they are still dependent on deformations of that path due to noise. The first question that we tackle in this work is how to quantify in a meaningful way this effect of noise, focusing, for concreteness, on the nuclear quadrupole resonance Hamiltonian-other systems of this nature can clearly be treated analogously. We consider a precessing magnetic field that drives adiabatically a degenerate doublet and is subjected to noise, the effects of which on the Wilczek-Zee holonomy are computed analytically. A critical review of previous related works reveals a series of assumptions, such as sudden jumps in the field, or the presence of white noise, that might violate adiabaticity. We propose a state-independent measure of the effect and then consider sinusoidal noise in the field of random amplitude and phase. We find that all integer noise frequencies m not equal 2 behave similarly in a manner reminiscent of the Abelian case, but that noise of frequency m = 2 has a very different and, at the same time, very pronounced effect, which might well affect robustness estimations.

TI Disentangling Losses in Tantalum Superconducting Circuits
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW X
AB Superconducting qubits are a leading system for realizing large-scale quantum processors, but overall gate fidelities suffer from coherence times limited by microwave dielectric loss. Recently discovered tantalum-based qubits exhibit record lifetimes exceeding 0.3 ms. Here, we perform systematic, detailed measurements of superconducting tantalum resonators in order to disentangle sources of loss that limit state-of-the-art tantalum devices. By studying the dependence of loss on temperature, microwave photon number, and device geometry, we quantify materials-related losses and observe that the losses are dominated by several types of saturable two-level systems (TLSs), with evidence that both surface and bulk related TLSs contribute to loss. Moreover, we show that surface TLSs can be altered with chemical processing. With four different surface conditions, we quantitatively extract the linear absorption associated with different surface TLS sources. Finally, we quantify the impact of the chemical processing at singlephoton powers, the relevant conditions for qubit device performance. In this regime, we measure resonators with internal quality factors ranging from 5 to 15 x 10(6), comparable to the best qubits reported. In these devices, the surface and bulk TLS contributions to loss are comparable, showing that systematic improvements in materials on both fronts are necessary to improve qubit coherence further.

TI Room-temperature emitters in wafer-scale few-layer hBN by atmospheric
   pressure CVD
SO FLATCHEM
AB Hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) is a two-dimensional, wide band gap semiconductor material suitable for several technologies. 2D hBN appeared as a viable platform to produce bright and optically stable single photon emitters (SPEs) at room temperature, which are in demand for quantum technologies. In this context, one main challenge concerns the upscaling of 2D hBN with uniform spatial and spectral distribution of SPE sources. In this work we optimized the atmospheric-pressure chemical vapor deposition (APCVD) growth and obtained large-area 2D hBN with uniform fluorescence emission properties. We characterized the hBN films by a combination of electron microscopy, Raman and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy techniques. The extensive characterization revealed few-layer, polycrystalline hBN films (-3 nm thickness) with balanced stoichiometry and uniformity over 2 '' wafer scale. We studied the fluorescence emission properties of the hBN films by multidimensional hyperspectral fluorescence microscopy. We measured simultaneously the spatial position, intensity, and spectral properties of the emitters, which were exposed to continuous illumination over minutes. Three main emission peaks (at 538, 582, and 617 nm) were observed, with associated replica peaks red-shifted by -53 nm. A surface emitter density of -0.1 emitters/mu m2 was found. A comparative test with pristine hBN nanosheets produced by liquid-phase exfoliation (LPE) was performed, finding that CVD and LPE hBN possess analogous spectral emitter categories in terms of peak position/intensity and density. Overall, the line-shape and wavelength of the emission peaks, as well as the other measured features, are consistent with single-photon emission from hBN. The results indicate that APCVD hBN might proficiently serve as a SPE platform for quantum technologies.

TI Robust quantification of the diamond nitrogen-vacancy center charge
   state via photoluminescence spectroscopy
SO APL PHOTONICS
AB Nitrogen vacancy (NV) centers in diamond are at the heart of many emerging quantum technologies, all of which require control over the NV charge state. Hence, methods for quantification of the relative photoluminescence intensities of the NV0 and NV- charge states, i.e., a charge state ratio, are vital. Several approaches to quantify NV charge state ratios have been reported but are either limited to bulk-like NV diamond samples or yield qualitative results. We propose an NV charge state quantification protocol based on the determination of sample- and experimental setup-specific NV0 and NV- reference spectra. The approach employs blue (400-470 nm) and green (480-570 nm) excitation to infer pure NV0 and NV- spectra, which are then used to quantify NV charge state ratios in subsequent experiments via least squares fitting. We test our dual excitation protocol (DEP) for a bulk diamond NV sample and 20 and 100 nm nanodiamond particles and compare results with those obtained via other commonly used techniques such as zero-phonon line fitting and non-negative matrix factorization. We find that DEP can be employed across different samples and experimental setups and yields consistent and quantitative results for NV charge state ratios that are in agreement with our understanding of NV photophysics. By providing robust NV charge state quantification across sample types and measurement platforms, DEP will support the development of NV-based quantum technologies. (c) 2025 Author(s).

TI Self-correcting quantum many-body control using reinforcement learning
   with tensor networks
SO NATURE MACHINE INTELLIGENCE
AB Quantum many-body control is a central milestone en route to harnessing quantum technologies. However, the exponential growth of the Hilbert space dimension with the number of qubits makes it challenging to classically simulate quantum many-body systems and, consequently, to devise reliable and robust optimal control protocols. Here we present a framework for efficiently controlling quantum many-body systems based on reinforcement learning (RL). We tackle the quantum-control problem by leveraging matrix product states (1) for representing the many-body state and (2) as part of the trainable machine learning architecture for our RL agent. The framework is applied to prepare ground states of the quantum Ising chain, including states in the critical region. It allows us to control systems far larger than neural-network-only architectures permit, while retaining the advantages of deep learning algorithms, such as generalizability and trainable robustness to noise. In particular, we demonstrate that RL agents are capable of finding universal controls, of learning how to optimally steer previously unseen many-body states and of adapting control protocols on the fly when the quantum dynamics is subject to stochastic perturbations. Furthermore, we map our RL framework to a hybrid quantum-classical algorithm that can be performed on noisy intermediate-scale quantum devices and test it under the presence of experimentally relevant sources of noise.
   Optimal control of quantum many-body systems is needed to make use of quantum technologies, but is challenging due to the exponentially large dimension of the Hilbert space as a function of the number of qubits. Metz and Bukov propose a framework combining matrix product states and reinforcement learning that allows control of a larger number of interacting quantum particles than achievable with standard neural-network-based methods.

TI Analysing carbapenemases in hospital wastewater: Insights from
   intracellular and extracellular DNA using qPCR and digital PCR
SO SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
AB The widespread dissemination of carbapenem-resistant bacteria in wastewater systems, particularly from clinical sources, poses a significant public health risk. This study assessed the concentrations and distributions of extracellular DNA (exDNA) and intracellular DNA (iDNA) harboring carbapenemase genes in wastewater from six tertiary care hospitals in Germany. We collected a total of 36 samples, comprising six biological replicates from each hospital, and analysed them using quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) and digital PCR (dPCR). The analysis targeted seven carbapenemase genes: blaNDM, blaKPC, blaIMP, blaVIM, blaOXA-23-like, blaOXA-48-like, and blaOXA-58-like across both DNA fractions. Our results revealed significant variability in the concentrations of exDNA and iDNA across the sampling sites, with iDNA typically present at higher concentrations. Using NanoDrop One spectrophotometry and the Qubit dsDNA kit, exDNA concentrations ranged from 2.7 to 7.7 ng/mL, while Qubit recorded lower values between 1.1 and 4.0 ng/mL. Conversely, iDNA concentrations were markedly higher, spanning from 42.3 to 191.7 ng/mL with NanoDrop and 12.0 to 46.5 ng/mL with Qubit, highlighting the variability between DNA types and quantification methods. Despite its lower concentrations, exDNA comprised up to 18.2 % of total DNA, high- lighting its potential role in the horizontal transfer of antimicrobial resistance genes (ARGs). The study detected target ARGs in both DNA fractions at all sites, with notable differences in their concen- trations; iDNA consistently exhibited higher levels of ARGs, with the highest concentrations reaching 10.57 f 0.20 log gene copies per liter (GC/L) for bla VIM in iDNA and 6.96 f 0.72 log GC/L for bla IMP in exDNA. dPCR demonstrated greater sensitivity than qPCR, especially effective for detecting low-abundance targets like bla OXA- 23-like in the exDNA fraction. Additionally, qPCR's susceptibility to inhibition and contamination emphasizes the superior robustness of dPCR. This research highlights the need for improved monitoring and the implementation of advanced treatment technologies to mitigate ARG dissemination in wastewater.

TI SQUIDs for magnetic and electromagnetic methods in mineral exploration
SO MINERAL ECONOMICS
AB Research on quantum sensors for the detection of magnetic fields (quantum magnetometers) is one of the fast-moving areas of Quantum Technologies. Since there exist expectations about their use in geophysics, this work will provide a brief overview on the various developing quantum technologies and their individual state of the art for implementing quantum magnetometers. As one example, the developments on superconducting quantum interference devices, so-called SQUIDs as a specific implementation of a quantum magnetometer, are presented. In the course of this, SQUID instrument implementations and associated demonstrations and case studies will be presented. An airborne vector magnetometer with ultra-low noise (<10fT/Hz will be introduced which has the prospect to be applied for the magnetic method in parallel with electromagnetic methods such as passive audio-frequency magnetics or semi-airborne methods using active transmitters such as elongated grounded dipole sources. The according signals are separated in the frequency domain. A second implementation is an airborne full tensor gradiometer instrument will be discussed which has shown already a number of successful case studies and which turned into commercial operation in the past years. Besides the airborne instrument, a very successful implementation of quantum magnetometers is the SQUID-based receiver for the ground-based transient electromagnetic method. Today it is a mature technology which has been in commercial use for more than a decade and has led to a number of discoveries of conductive ore bodies. One case study will be presented which demonstrates the performance of this instrument. Finally, future prospects of using quantum magnetometers, including SQUIDs and new optically pumped magnetometers, in geophysical exploration will be discussed. Particular applications for both sensor types will be introduced.

TI Photon blockade in a Tavis-Cummings system
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW APPLIED
AB We observe blockade of microwave photons in a Tavis-Cummings system comprising a superconducting cavity and up to N = 3 transmon qubits. The effect is characterized with photon-number-resolving spectroscopy using an additional dispersively coupled transmon "witness" qubit to directly probe the cavity's photon-number distribution. We first observe polariton formation with splitting proportional to root N , confirming the Tavis-Cummings coupling, and subsequently obtain sub-Poissonian cavity photon statistics when the cavity is driven at polariton frequencies.

TI Explicit Pfaffian formula for amplitudes of fermionic Gaussian pure
   states in arbitrary Pauli bases
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
AB The explicit computation of amplitudes for fermionic Gaussian pure states in arbitrary Pauli bases is a long-standing challenge in quantum many-body physics, with significant implications for quantum tomography, experimental studies, and quantum dynamics. These calculations are essential for analyzing complex properties beyond traditional measures, such as formation probabilities, global entanglement, and entropy in nonstandard bases, where exact and computationally efficient methods remain underdeveloped. In addition to these physical applications, having explicit formulas is crucial for optimizing negative log-likelihood functions in quantum tomography, a key task in the NISQ era. In this work, we present an explicit Pfaffian formula (Theorem 1) for determining these amplitudes in arbitrary Pauli bases, utilizing a matrix whose structure reflects the qubit parity. Additionally, we introduce a recursive relation (Theorem 2) that connects amplitudes for systems with varying qubit numbers, enabling scalable computations for large systems. Together, these results provide a versatile framework for studying global entanglement, Shannon-R & eacute;nyi entropies, formation probabilities, and performing efficient quantum tomography, thereby significantly expanding the computational toolkit for analyzing complex quantum systems. Finally, we utilize our formalism to determine the post-measurement entanglement entropy, reflecting how local measurements alter entanglement, and compare the results with conformal field theory predictions.

TI Spin-valley protected Kramers pair in bilayer graphene
SO NATURE NANOTECHNOLOGY
AB The intrinsic valley degree of freedom makes bilayer graphene (BLG) a unique platform for semiconductor qubits. The single-carrier quantum dot (QD) ground state exhibits a twofold degeneracy, where the two states that constitute a Kramers pair have opposite spin and valley quantum numbers. Because of the valley-dependent Berry curvature, an out-of-plane magnetic field breaks the time-reversal symmetry of this ground state and a qubit can be encoded in the spin-valley subspace. The Kramers states are protected against known spin- and valley-mixing mechanisms because mixing requires a simultaneous change of the two quantum numbers. Here, we fabricate a tunable QD device in Bernal BLG and measure a spin-valley relaxation time for the Kramers states of 38 s at 30 mK, which is two orders of magnitude longer than the 0.4 s measured for purely spin-blocked states. We also show that the intrinsic Kane-Mele spin-orbit splitting enables a Kramers doublet single-shot readout even at zero magnetic field with a fidelity above 99%. If these long-lived Kramers states also possess long coherence times and can be effectively manipulated, electrostatically defined QDs in BLG may serve as long-lived semiconductor qubits, extending beyond the spin qubit paradigm.

TI Efficient harmonic generation in an adiabatic multimode submicron
   tapered optical fiber
SO COMMUNICATIONS PHYSICS
AB Optical nanotapers fabricated by tapering optical fibers have attracted considerable interest as an ultimate platform for high-efficiency light-matter interactions. While previously demonstrated applications relied exclusively on the low-loss transmission of only the fundamental mode, the implementation of multimode tapers that adiabatically transmit several modes has remained very challenging, hindering their use in various emerging applications in multimode nonlinear optics and quantum optics. Here, we report the realization of multimode submicron tapers that permit the simultaneous adiabatic transmission of multiple higher-order modes including the LP02 mode, through introducing deep wet-etching of conventional fiber before fiber tapering. Furthermore, as a critical application, we demonstrate fundamental-to-fundamental all-fiber third-harmonic generation with high conversion efficiencies. Our work paves the way for ultrahigh-efficiency multimode nonlinear and quantum optics, facilitating nonclassical light generation in the multimode regime, multimode soliton interactions and photonic quantum gates, and manipulation of the evanescent-field-induced optical trapping potentials of atoms and nanoparticles.
   Low-loss multimode optical nanofibers could provide a platform for studying and technologically exploiting nonlinear light-matter interactions. Here, adiabatic transport of multiple modes and highly efficient fundamental-to-fundamental third harmonic generation is demonstrated in a submicron silica fiber.

TI Fast long-distance transport of cold cesium atoms
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Transporting cold atoms between distant sections of a vacuum system is a central ingredient in many quantum simulation experiments, in particular in setups, where large optical access and precise control over magnetic fields is needed. In this work, we demonstrate optical transport of cold cesium atoms over a total transfer distance of about 43 cm in less than 30 ms. The high speed is facilitated by a moving lattice, which is generated via the interference of a Bessel and a Gaussian laser beam. We transport about 3 x 10(6) atoms at a temperature of a few microkelvins with a transport efficiency of about 75%. We provide a detailed study of the transport efficiency for different accelerations and lattice depths and find that the transport efficiency is mainly limited by a fast initial loss most likely due to the sudden onset of the acceleration and the potential depth along the direction of gravity. To highlight the suitability of the optical-transport setup for quantum simulation experiments, we demonstrate the generation of a pure Bose-Einstein condensate with about 2 x 10(4) atoms. We find a robust final atom number within 2% over a duration of 2.5 h with a standard deviation of <5% between individual experimental realizations.

TI Edge-assisted quantum protocol for secure multiparty logical AND its
   applications
SO ISCIENCE
AB Security and privacy have always been key concerns for individuals in various edge-assisted services. In this paper, we present a feasible quantum solution to an important primitive of secure multiparty computations, i.e., Secure Multiparty Logical AND (SMLA), in which n participants can securely compute logical AND of n private bits. In order to ensure perfect security and achieve good feasibility, we introduce a semi-honest edge server and two non-collusive fog nodes, and design a secure and feasible edge-assisted quantum protocol for SMLA, which cleverly utilizes Secure Multiparty XOR to implement SMLA group by group. Further-more, we focus on applications of this quantum primitive protocol and design two quantum protocols for Multiple Private Set Intersection and Anonymous One-vote Veto. Compared with classical related protocols, our proposed quan-tum protocols obtain higher security, which can be guaranteed by the basic principles of quantum mechanics.

TI Semi-empirical Haken-Strobl model for molecular spin qubits
SO NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB Understanding the physical processes that determine the relaxation T 1 and dephasing T 2 times of molecular spin qubits is critical for envisioned applications in quantum metrology and information processing. Recent spin-echo measurements of solid-state molecular spin qubits have stimulated the development of quantum mechanical models for predicting intrinsic qubit timescales using first-principles electronic structure methods. We develop an alternative semi-empirical approach to construct Redfield quantum master equations for molecular spin qubits using a stochastic Haken-Strobl theory for a central spin with fluctuating gyromagnetic tensor due to spin-lattice interaction and fluctuating local magnetic field due to interactions with lattice spins. Using two vanadium-based spin qubits as case studies, we compute qubit population and decoherence times as a function of temperature and magnetic field, using a bath spectral density parametrized with a small number of T 1 measurements. The theory quantitatively agrees with experimental data over a range of conditions beyond those used to parameterize the model, demonstrating the generalization potential of the method. The ability of the model to describe the temperature dependence of the ratio T2/T1 is discussed and possible applications for designing novel molecule-based quantum magnetometers are suggested.

TI Visualizing spinon Fermi surfaces with time-dependent spectroscopy
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
AB Quantum simulation experiments have started to explore regimes that are not accessible with exact numerical methods. To probe these systems and enable new physical insights, the need for measurement protocols arises that can bridge the gap to solid-state experiments, and at the same time make optimal use of the capabilities of quantum simulation experiments. Here we propose applying time-dependent photoemission spectroscopy, an established tool in solid-state systems, in cold atom quantum simulators. Concretely, we suggest combining the method with large magnetic field gradients, unattainable in experiments on real materials, to drive Bloch oscillations of spinons, the emergent quasiparticles of spin liquids. We show in exact diagonalization simulations of the one-dimensional t-J model with a single hole that the spinons start to populate previously unoccupied states in an effective band structure, thus allowing us to visualize states invisible in the equilibrium spectrum. The dependence of the spectral function on the time after the pump pulse reveals collective interactions among spinons. In numerical simulations of small two-dimensional systems, spectral weight appears at the ground-state energy at momentum q = (pi, pi), where the equilibrium spectral response is strongly suppressed up to higher energies, indicating a possible route toward solving the mystery of the Fermi arcs in the cuprate materials.

TI Reliability of lattice gauge theories in the thermodynamic limit br
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
AB Although gauge invariance is a postulate in fundamental theories of nature such as quantum electrodynamics,in quantum-simulation implementations of gauge theories it is compromised by experimental imperfections. In arecent paper [Halimeh and Hauke,Phys.Rev.Lett.125, 030503 (2020)], it has been shown in finite-size spin-1/2quantum link lattice gauge theories that upon introducing an energy-penalty term of sufficiently large strengthV, unitary gauge-breaking errors at strength lambda are suppressed proportional to lambda 2/V2up to all accessible evolution times.Here, we show numerically that this result extends to quantum link models in the thermodynamic limit and withlarger spinS. As we show analytically, the dynamics at short times is described by anadjustedgauge theoryup to a timescale that is at earliest tau adj proportional to root V/V30, withV0an energy factor. Moreover, our analytics predictsthat a renormalized gauge theory dominates at intermediate times up to a timescale tau ren proportional to exp(V/V0)/V0.Inboth emergent gauge theories,Vis volume independent and scales at worst similar to S2. Furthermore, we numericallydemonstrate that robust gauge invariance is also retained through a single-body gauge-protection term, which isexperimentally straightforward to implement in ultracold-atom setups and NISQ device

TI Nonlinear and non-CP gates for Bloch vector amplification
SO COMMUNICATIONS IN THEORETICAL PHYSICS
AB Any state r = (x, y, z) of a qubit, written in the Pauli basis and initialized in the pure state r = (0, 0, 1), can be prepared by composing three quantum operations: two unitary rotation gates to reach a pure state r=x2+y2+z2-12x(x,y,z) on the Bloch sphere, followed by a depolarization gate to decrease divide r divide . Here we discuss the complementary state-preparation protocol for qubits initialized at the center of the Bloch ball, r = 0, based on increasing or amplifying divide r divide to its desired value, then rotating. Bloch vector amplification increases purity and decreases entropy. Amplification can be achieved with a linear Markovian completely positive trace-preserving (CPTP) channel by placing the channel's fixed point away from r = 0, making it nonunital, but the resulting gate suffers from a critical slowing down as that fixed point is approached. Here we consider alternative designs based on linear and nonlinear Markovian PTP channels, which offer benefits relative to linear CPTP channels, namely fast Bloch vector amplification without deceleration. These gates simulate a reversal of the thermodynamic arrow of time for the qubit and would provide striking experimental demonstrations of non-CP dynamics.

TI Accessing the topological Mott insulator in cold atom quantum simulators
   with realistic Rydberg dressing
SO QUANTUM SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB The interplay between many-body interactions and the kinetic energy gives rise to rich phase diagrams hosting, among others, interaction-induced topological phases. These phases are characterized by both a local order parameter and a global topological invariant, and can exhibit exotic ground states such as self-trapped polarons and interaction-induced edge states. In this work, we investigate a realistic scenario for the quantum simulation of such systems using cold Rydberg-dressed atoms in optical lattices. We consider spinless fermions on a checkerboard lattice, interacting via the tunable-range effective potential induced by the Rydberg dressing. We perform a detailed analysis of the phase diagram at half- and incommensurate fillings, in the mean-field approximation. We furthermore study the stability of the phases with respect to temperature within the mean-field approximation and with respect to quantum fluctuations using the density matrix renormalization group method. Finally, we propose an implementation protocol, and in particular identify attainable regimes of experimental parameters in which the topological properties of the model become accessible. Our work thereby opens a realistic pathway to the outstanding experimental observation of this predicted phase in state-of-the-art cold atom quantum simulators.

TI Characterization of Nb films for superconducting qubits using phase
   boundary measurements
SO APPLIED PHYSICS LETTERS
AB Continued advances in superconducting qubit performance require more detailed understandings of the many sources of decoherence. Within these devices, two-level systems arise due to defects, interfaces, and grain boundaries and are thought to be a major source of qubit decoherence at millikelvin temperatures. In addition to Al, Nb is a commonly used metallization layer in superconducting qubits. Consequently, a significant effort is required to develop and qualify processes that mitigate defects in Nb films. As the fabrication of complete superconducting qubits and their characterization at millikelvin temperatures is a time and resource intensive process, it is desirable to have measurement tools that can rapidly characterize the properties of films and evaluate different treatments. Here, we show that measurements of the variation of the superconducting critical temperature T-c with an applied external magnetic field H (of the phase boundary T- c - H) performed with very high-resolution show features that are directly correlated with the structure of the Nb films. In combination with x-ray diffraction measurements, we show that one can even distinguish variations in the size and crystal orientation of the grains in a Nb film by small but reproducible changes in the measured superconducting phase boundary.

   phonon-decoupled two-color excitation
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
AB Single-photon sources with near-unity efficiency and indistinguishability play a major role in the development of quantum technologies. However, on-demand excitation of the emitter imposes substantial limitations to the source performance. Here, we show that coherent two-color pumping allows for population inversion arbitrarily close to unity in bulk quantum dots thanks to a decoupling effect between the emitter and its phonon bath. Driving a micropillar single-photon source with this scheme, we calculate very high photon emission into the cavity mode (0.95 photons per pulse) together with excellent indistinguishability (0.975) in a realistic configuration, thereby removing the limitations imposed by the excitation scheme on single-photon source engineering.

TI Local Control and Mixed Dimensions: Exploring High-Temperature
   Superconductivity in Optical Lattices
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB The simulation of high-temperature superconducting materials by implementing strongly correlated fermionic models in optical lattices is one of the major objectives in the field of analog quantum simulation. Here we show that local control and optical bilayer capabilities combined with spatially resolved measurements create a versatile toolbox to study fundamental properties of both nickelate and cuprate high-temperature superconductors. On the one hand, we present a scheme to implement a mixed- dimensional (mixD) bilayer model that has been proposed to capture the essential pairing physics of pressurized bilayer nickelates. This allows for the long-sought realization of a state with long-range superconducting order in current lattice quantum simulation machines. In particular, we show how coherent pairing correlations can be accessed in a partially particle-hole transformed and rotated basis. On the other hand, we demonstrate that control of local gates enables the observation of d-wave pairing order in the two-dimensional (single-layer) repulsive Fermi-Hubbard model through the simulation of a system with attractive interactions. Lastly, we introduce a scheme to measure momentum-resolved dopant densities, providing access to observables complementary to solid-state experiments-which is of particular interest for future studies of the enigmatic pseudogap phase appearing in cuprates.

TI QF-LCA dataset: Quantum Field Lens Coding Algorithm for system state
   simulation and strong predictions
SO DATA IN BRIEF
AB Quantum field lens coding algorithm (QF-LCA) dataset is useful for simulating systems and predict system events with high probability. This is achieved by computing QF lens distance-based variables associated to event probabilities from the dataset produced by field lenses that encode system states on a quantum level. The probability of a state transition (ST), doubles in prediction values at the decoding step, e.g., ST probabilities of P > 1 / 3 into P > 2 / 3 based on a single field (SF) transform into a quantum double-field (QDF). This transformation doubles the ST probability space via the field's scalar kappa, in a published QDF method article. A QDF, as a double-field computation (DFC) model, simulates thermodynamic systems in predicting events by producing datasets from a QF-LCA, using laser cooling methods relative to high energy systems. The dataset can be used to, e.g., train quantum algorithms via quantum artificial intelligence (QAI) for a QF-LCA user. The user then decides after the algorithm predicts and suggests an efficient energy path for the system to choose. For example, an N -particle system simulated as a heat engine, by QAI classifier(s), predicts and reroutes particle energy paths on a logarithmic input-output scale. To determine system's energy change, the QDF lens code (DFC) measures entanglement entropy (EE). The algorithm's classification of EE values distinguishes entangled states in the system. The QF-LCA program employs the dataset to achieve an automated prediction and classification method, rather than dataset's manual use and analysis by the user. As the system evolves in its distribution of states, those particles not reaching a desired energy state (a target state or TS), i.e., the probability of observing a ground or excited state (GS or ES) outcome at the decoding step, can be rerouted by the heat engine to satisfy a TS outcome. This establishes a GS or ES energy profile to access and classify states by a classifier. The data points (qubits) in this profile are inverse distance-based and labelled for a specific class. After learning the profile, the classifier decodes and predicts the next sys- tem state. A QDF AI game " Alice & Bob's Quantum Doubles, " is developed to validate the dataset as the P 's map for a classi- cal/quantum prediction where the P 's of states and the user's P 's correlate in their value difference, O P . Dataset validation results are mapped to an intelligent decision simulator (IDS) as a QAI map. This maximizes system efficiency on a TS by EE of energy states (distributed in the system). Future addi- tions to the dataset from the QAI map program can improve quantum algorithms to determine which particles of the sys- tem participate in a phase transition after state prediction. QF-LCA applications are in data science, security, forensics, particle physics, etc., such as retrieving or reconstructing in- formation by distinguishing particle states from an evidence sample. Examples are, reconstruct damaged DNA strands of cells to predict a virus's TS, or cancer cell, its spread and growth against healthy cells, identify forged documents from genuine based on QDF's P values, and so on.

TI Overdispersion in Gate Tomography: Experiments and Continuous, Two-Scale
   Random Walk Model on the Bloch Sphere
SO ACM TRANSACTIONS ON QUANTUM COMPUTING
AB Noisy intermediate-scale quantum computers (NISQ) are computing hardware in their childhood, but they are showing high promise and growing quickly. They are based on so-called qubits, which are the quantum equivalents of bits. Any given qubit state results in a given probability of observing a value of zero or one in the readout process. One of the main concerns for NISQ machines is the inherent noisiness of qubits, i.e., the observable frequencies of zeros and ones do not correspond to the theoretically expected probability, as the qubit states are subject to random disturbances over time and with each additional algorithmic operation applied to them. Models to describe the influence of this noise exist. In this study, we conduct extensive experiments on quantum noise. Based on our data, we show that existing noise models lack important aspects. Specifically, they fail to properly capture the aggregation of noise effects over time (or over an algorithm's runtime), and they are underdispersed. With underdispersion, we refer to the fact that observable frequencies scatter much more between repeated experiments than what the standard assumptions of the binomial distribution would allow for. Based on these shortcomings, we develop an extended noise model for the probability distribution of observable frequencies as a function of the number of gate operations. The model roots back to a known continuous random walk on the (Bloch) sphere, where the angular diffusion coefficient can be used to characterize the standard noisiness of gate operations. Here, we superimpose a second random walk at the scale of multiple readouts to account for overdispersion. Further, our model has known, explicit components for noise during state preparation and measurement. The interaction of these two random walks predicts theoretical, runtime-dependent bounds for probabilities. Overall, it is a three-parameter distributional model that fits the data much better than the corresponding one- scale model (without overdispersion), and we demonstrate the better fit and the plausibility of the predicted bounds via Bayesian data-model analysis.

TI A Full-Stack View of Probabilistic Computing With p-Bits: Devices,
   Architectures, and Algorithms
SO IEEE JOURNAL ON EXPLORATORY SOLID-STATE COMPUTATIONAL DEVICES AND
   CIRCUITS
AB The transistor celebrated its 75th birthday in 2022. The continued scaling of the transistor defined by Moore's law continues, albeit at a slower pace. Meanwhile, computing demands and energy consumption required by modern artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms have skyrocketed. As an alternative to scaling transistors for general-purpose computing, the integration of transistors with unconventional technologies has emerged as a promising path for domain-specific computing. In this article, we provide a full-stack review of probabilistic computing with p-bits as a representative example of the energy-efficient and domain-specific computing movement. We argue that p-bits could be used to build energy-efficient probabilistic systems, tailored for probabilistic algorithms and applications. From hardware, architecture, and algorithmic perspectives, we outline the main applications of probabilistic computers ranging from probabilistic machine learning (ML) and AI to combinatorial optimization and quantum simulation. Combining emerging nanodevices with the existing CMOS ecosystem will lead to probabilistic computers with orders of magnitude improvements in energy efficiency and probabilistic sampling, potentially unlocking previously unexplored regimes for powerful probabilistic algorithms.

TI The avian compass can be sensitive even without sustained electron spin
   coherence
SO PROCEEDINGS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY A-MATHEMATICAL PHYSICAL AND ENGINEERING
   SCIENCES
AB Theoretical studies indicating the presence of long-lived coherence in the radical pair system have engendered questions about its utilitarian role in the avian compass. In this paper, we investigate the role of electron spin coherence in a multinuclear radical pair system including its impact on compass sensitivity. We find that sustenance of long-lived electron spin coherence is unlikely in a multinuclear hyperfine environment. After probing the role of the hyperfine interactions in the compass, we affirm the hyperfine anisotropy to be an essential parameter for the necessary sensitivity required for the compass action. Thereby, we identify a parameter regime where the compass would exhibit good sensitivity even without sustained electron spin coherence.

TI Simulating Prethermalization Using Near-Term Quantum Computers
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB Quantum simulation is one of the most promising scientific applications of quantum computers. Due to decoherence and noise in current devices, it is however challenging to perform digital quantum simulation in a regime that is intractable with classical computers. In this work, we propose an experimental protocol for probing dynamics and equilibrium properties on near-term digital quantum computers. As a key ingredient of our work, we show that it is possible to study thermalization even with a relatively coarse Trotter decomposition of the Hamiltonian evolution of interest. Even though the step size is too large to permit a rigorous bound on the Trotter error, we observe that the system prethermalizes in accordance with previous results for Floquet systems. The dynamics closely resemble the thermalization of the model underlying the Trotterization up to long times. We make our approach resilient to noise by developing an error mitigation scheme based on measurement and rescaling of survival probabilities, which is applicable to time-evolution problems in general. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the entire protocol by applying it to the two-dimensional XY model and we numerically verify its performance with realistic noise parameters for superconducting quantum devices. Our proposal thus provides a route to achieving quantum advantage for relevant problems in condensed-matter physics.

We identify points in control parameter space of enhanced anomalous symmetry, which imposes robust twofold degeneracy of its ground state, that is for all values of the energy parameters of the model. We show, both analytically and numerically, how this anomalous symmetry is maintained in the low-energy sector, thus providing us with a strong candidate for robust qubit engineering.

TI Model-Free Quantum Control with Reinforcement Learning
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW X
AB Model bias is an inherent limitation of the current dominant approach to optimal quantum control, which relies on a system simulation for optimization of control policies. To overcome this limitation, we propose a circuit-based approach for training a reinforcement learning agent on quantum control tasks in a model-free way. Given a continuously parametrized control circuit, the agent learns its parameters through trial-and-error interaction with the quantum system, using measurement outcomes as the only source of information about the quantum state. Focusing on control of a harmonic oscillator coupled to an ancilla qubit, we show how to reward the learning agent with measurements of experimentally available observables. We train the agent to prepare various nonclassical states via both unitary control and control with adaptive measurement-based quantum feedback, and to execute logical gates on encoded qubits. The agent does not rely on averaging for state tomography or fidelity estimation, and significantly outperforms widely used model-free methods in terms of sample efficiency. Our numerical work is of immediate relevance to superconducting circuits and trapped ions platforms where such training can be implemented in experiment, allowing complete elimination of model bias and the adaptation of quantum control policies to the specific system in which they are deployed.

TI Readout of quantum devices with a sideband microwave interferometer
   immune to systematic noise
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW APPLIED
AB The accuracy of microwave measurements is not only critical for applications in telecommunication and radar but also for future quantum computers. Qubit technologies such as superconducting qubits or spin qubits require the detection of minuscule signals, typically achieved by reflecting a microwave tone off a resonator that is coupled to the qubit. Noise from cabling and amplification, e.g., from temperature variations, can be detrimental to readout fidelity. We present an approach to detect phase and amplitude changes of a device under test based on the differential measurement of microwave tones generated by two first-order sidebands of a carrier signal. The two microwave tones are sent through the same cable to the measured device that exhibits a narrow-band response for one sideband and leaves the other unaffected. The reflected sidebands are interfered by down-conversion with the carrier. By choosing the amplitude and phases of the sidebands, suppression of either common-amplitude or common-phase noise can be achieved, allowing for fast, stable measurements of frequency shifts and quality factors of resonators. Test measurements were performed on NbN superconducting resonators at 25 mK to calibrate and characterize the experimental setup and to study time-dependent fluctuations of their resonance frequency.

TI Dynamical charge susceptibility in nonequilibrium double quantum dots
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
AB Double quantum dots are one of the promising two-state quantum systems for realizing qubits. In the quest of successfully manipulating and reading information in qubit systems, it is of prime interest to control the charge response of the system to a gate voltage, as filled in by the dynamical charge susceptibility. We theoretically study this quantity for a nonequilibrium double quantum dot by using the functional integral approach and derive its general analytical expression. One highlights the existence of two lines of maxima as a function of the dot level energies, each of them being split under the action of a bias voltage. In the low frequency limit, we derive the capacitance and the charge relaxation resistance of the equivalent quantum RC-circuit with a notable difference in the range of variation for R depending on whether the system is connected in series or in parallel. By incorporating an additional triplet state in order to describe the situation of a double quantum dot with spin, we obtain results for the resonator phase response which are in qualitative agreement with recent experimental observations in spin qubit systems. These results show the wealth of information brought by the knowledge of dynamical charge susceptibility in double quantum dots with potential applications for spin qubits.

TI Strong electron-electron interactions in Si/SiGe quantum dots
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
AB Interactions between electrons can strongly affect the shape and functionality of multielectron quantum dots. The resulting charge distributions can be localized, as in the case of Wigner molecules, with consequences for the energy spectrum and tunneling to states outside the dot. The situation is even more complicated for silicon dots, due to the interplay between valley, orbital, and interaction energy scales. Here, we study two-electron wave functions in electrostatically confined quantum dots formed in a SiGe/Si/SiGe quantum well at zero magnetic field, using a combination of tight-binding and full configuration interaction methods, and taking into account atomic-scale disorder at the quantum well interface. We model dots based on recent qubit experiments, which straddle the boundary between strongly interacting and weakly interacting systems, and display a rich and diverse range of behaviors. Our calculations show that strong electron-electron interactions, induced by weak confinement, can significantly suppress the low-lying, singlet-triplet (ST) excitation energy. However, when the valley-orbit interactions caused by interfacial disorder are weak, the ST splitting can approach its noninteracting value, even when the electron-electron interactions are strong and Wigner-molecule behavior is observed. These results have important implications for the rational design and fabrication of quantum dot qubits with predictable properties.

TI Experimental test of the chained CHSH inequality in a two-dimensional
   orbital angular momentum system
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB The chained CHSH inequality is of paramount importance in quantum information science, demonstrating superiority over the CHSH inequality in some quantum information tasks. Hitherto, experimental verification was rarely considered to verify the chained CHSH inequality, as previous experimental efforts primarily focused on the CHSH inequality. Here, by employing two-photon orbital angular momentum (OAM) entanglement, we experimentally demonstrate the chained CHSH across multiple settings. In theory, we demonstrate a geometrical connection of optimal measurement vectors and establish that the optimal measurement vectors reside in a circle through the center of the Bloch sphere. This allows us to construct multiple sets of optimal measurement vectors on different circles. In the experiment, we typically choose circles in the XOY, XOZ, and YOZ planes to observe violations of the chained CHSH inequality. Our experimental results indicate that the maximum violation increases with setting k, underscoring the dependence of the maximum violation on the measurement angles.

TI Crosstalk-robust quantum control in multimode bosonic systems
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW APPLIED
AB High-coherence superconducting cavities offer a hardware-efficient platform for quantum information processing. To achieve universal operations of these bosonic modes, the requisite nonlinearity is realized by coupling them to a transmon ancilla. However, this configuration is susceptible to crosstalk errors in the dispersive regime, where the ancilla frequency is Stark shifted by the state of each coupled bosonic mode. This leads to a frequency mismatch of the ancilla drive, lowering the gate fidelities. To mitigate such coherent errors, we employ quantum optimal control to engineer ancilla pulses that are robust to the frequency shifts. These optimized pulses are subsequently integrated into a recently developed echoed conditional displacement protocol for executing single- and two-mode operations. Through numerical simulations, we examine two representative scenarios: the preparation of single-mode Fock states in the presence of spectator modes and the generation of two-mode entangled Bell-cat states. Our approach markedly suppresses crosstalk errors, outperforming conventional ancilla control methods by orders of magnitude. These results provide guidance for experimentally achieving high-fidelity multimode operations and pave the way for developing high-performance bosonic quantum information processors.

TI Optimization Over Trace Polynomials
SO ANNALES HENRI POINCARE
AB Motivated by recent progress in quantum information theory, this article aims at optimizing trace polynomials, i.e., polynomials in noncommuting variables and traces of their products. A novel Positivstellensatz certifying positivity of trace polynomials subject to trace constraints is presented, and a hierarchy of semidefinite relaxations converging monotonically to the optimum of a trace polynomial subject to tracial constraints is provided. This hierarchy can be seen as a tracial analog of the Pironio, Navascues and Acin scheme (Pironio et al. in New J. Phys. 10(7):073013, 2008) for optimization of noncommutative polynomials. The Gelfand-Naimark-Segal (GNS) construction is applied to extract optimizers of the trace optimization problem if flatness and extremality conditions are satisfied. These conditions are sufficient to obtain finite convergence of our hierarchy. The results obtained are applied to violations of polynomial Bell inequalities in quantum information theory. The main techniques used in this paper are inspired by real algebraic geometry, operator theory, and noncommutative algebra.

TI Efficient characterization of N-beam Gaussian fields through
   photon-number measurements: Quantum universal invariants
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Quantum universal invariants of general N-beam Gaussian fields are investigated from the point of view of fields' intensity moments. A method that uniquely links these invariants, including the global and marginal fields' purities, to intensity moments is suggested. Determination of these invariants identifies the Gaussian states including their quantum correlations. In particular, the Peres-Horodecki separability criterion is reformulated in terms of quantum universal invariants, and consequently in terms of experimental intensity moments, offering a practical tool for determining the entanglement or separability of these states. The approach is experimentally demonstrated by determining the invariants of noisy symmetric three-beam Gaussian states using photon-number resolved measurements. Furthermore, their entanglement properties are analyzed and characterized.

TI Ensemble emission of isolated organic chromophores incorporated into an
   organometallic single crystal
SO NANOPHOTONICS
AB Molecular quantum emitters are becoming increasingly important in quantum information and communication. As a stepping stone towards a single-molecule quantum system, the collective emission from the ensemble of isolated organic chromophores, randomly and sparsely incorporated into an organometallic host crystal, is characterized by Raman and temperature-dependent photoluminescence spectroscopies. The tetracene or rubrene guest chromophores are deposited at very low densities when the ferrocene host is grown in a crystalline form, so that each of the chromophores is well isolated by its organometallic molecular neighbors. The ensemble emission of the chromophores is compared to that of the crystalline or dissolved forms to identify its unique spectral features. The enhanced quantum yield and reduced spectral linewidth with a significant blue-shift in photoluminescence suggest that ferrocene is a novel type of host matrix, maximizing the ability of the tetracene guest to act as a well-isolated quantum entity, while suppressing unwanted environmental decoherence by confining it within the ferromagnetic (organometallic) host material.

AB With the rapid advancements in optical and quantum communication, orbital angular momentum (OAM) has emerged as a promising approach for enhancing system performance, owing to its unique structural properties. However, efficiently transferring OAM modes between waveguides with low loss and stability remains a significant challenge in OAM systems. In this study, we demonstrate the transfer of arbitrary-order OAM modes from one waveguide to another with low insertion loss and stable performance, utilizing a symmetrical ring-core fiber coupler. Low-loss transfer of the third- and fourth-order OAM modes is achieved by precisely controlling the symmetrical structure of the two fibers to meet the coupling conditions, resulting in insertion losses of 0.72 and 0.51 dB at 1550 nm, respectively. Furthermore, over the wavelength range of 1500-1600 nm, the insertion loss for these modes is kept below 1.1 and 0.86 dB, respectively, exhibiting excellent spectral characteristics. In addition, the average insertion loss over the C-band for the third-order OAM mode transfer varies from 0.72 to 1.77 dB, while it is from 0.51 to 1.36 dB for the fourth-order OAM mode, both under various input polarization states, demonstrating stable performance. This function can upload and download OAM energy of arbitrary order within the waveguide, providing a new solution for the widespread application of OAM technology and contributing to the advancement of optical and quantum communication.

TI Online learning of a panoply of quantum objects
SO QUANTUM MACHINE INTELLIGENCE
AB In many quantum tasks, there is an unknown quantum object that one wishes to learn. An online strategy for this task involves adaptively refining a hypothesis to reproduce such an object or its measurement statistics. A common evaluation metric for such a strategy is its regret, or roughly the accumulated errors in hypothesis statistics. We prove a sublinear regret bound for learning over general subsets of positive semidefinite matrices via the regularized-follow-the-leader algorithm and apply it to various settings where one wishes to learn quantum objects. For concrete applications, we present a sublinear regret bound for learning quantum states, effects, channels, interactive measurements, strategies, co-strategies, and the collection of inner products of pure states. Our bound applies to many other quantum objects with compact, convex representations. In proving our regret bound, we establish various matrix analysis results useful in quantum information theory. This includes a generalization of Pinsker's inequality for arbitrary positive semidefinite operators with possibly different traces, which may be of independent interest and applicable to more general classes of divergences.

TI Gaussian tripartite steering in Schwarzschild black hole
SO PHYSICS LETTERS B
AB Multipartite steering is a fundamental quantum resource that is uniquely suited to tackling complex relativistic quantum information challenges, but its properties in the gravitational field context remain to be elucidated. We study the distribution of Gaussian tripartite steering in the background of a Schwarzschild black hole. Our results show that physically accessible 2-1 steerability remains robust at any Hawking temperature, which contrasts with the behavior of 1-1 steering that experiences "sudden death" as the Hawking temperature increases, making 2-1 steerability a more reliable candidate for relativistic quantum information tasks. Notably, we observe that the sudden death of quantum steering is accompanied by a peak in steering asymmetry, signifying a critical transition from two-way steering to one-way steering in the relativistic three-mode system. We find that the Hawking effect can generate inaccessible two-way steering of a bipartite system in both directions, as shown in Wang et al. (2016) [73], while it can only generate physically inaccessible one-way 2-1 steering in tripartite systems. These insights enhance our understanding of the redistribution of multipartite steering near the event horizon of the black hole.

TI Averaged null energy and the renormalization group
SO JOURNAL OF HIGH ENERGY PHYSICS
AB We establish a connection between the averaged null energy condition (ANEC) and the monotonicity of the renormalization group, by studying the light-ray operator integral duTuu in quantum field theories that flow between two conformal fixed points. In four dimensions, we derive an exact sum rule relating this operator to the Euler coefficient in the trace anomaly, and show that the ANEC implies the a-theorem. The argument is based on matching anomalies in the stress tensor 3-point function, and relies on special properties of contact terms involving light-ray operators. We also illustrate the sum rule for the example of a free massive scalar field. Averaged null energy appears in a variety of other applications to quantum field theory, including causality constraints, Lorentzian inversion, and quantum information. The quantum information perspective provides a new derivation of the a-theorem from the monotonicity of relative entropy. The equation relating our sum rule to the dilaton scattering amplitude in the forward limit suggests an inversion formula for non-conformal theories.

TI Steerability criteria based on Heisenberg-Weyl observables
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICS A-MATHEMATICAL AND THEORETICAL
AB Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR) steering is an intermediate form of nonlocality which interpolates between entanglement and Bell nonlocality. It has been shown that EPR steerable states are fundamental resources for one-sided device-independent quantum information tasks. Nevertheless, distinguishing quantum steerable states from the unsteerable ones in general cases remains a big challenge under active studies. The generalized Bloch representation of density matrices in terms of the Heisenberg observables is a useful tool for analyzing characteristics of quantum systems and plays an important role in quantum information. In this work, the role of this representation in detection of EPR steering is studied. More specifically, based on the correlation matrices of the Heisenberg-Weyl observables, a family of steerability criteria for arbitrary dimensional bipartite systems are proposed. A large class of Hermitian operators, which can conveniently witness steering in some scenarios, are further provided. Finally, these criteria are illustrated through several examples, are compared with some existing ones, and their power and advantages are exhibited in certain cases.

TI Classical and quantum regression analysis for the optoelectronic
   performance of NTCDA/p-Si UV photodiode
SO OPTIK
AB Due to the pivotal role of UV photodiodes in many technological applications in tandem with the high efficiency achieved by machine learning techniques in regression and classification problems, different artificial intelligence techniques are adopted to simulate and model the performance of organic/inorganic heterojunction UV photodiode. Herein, the performance of a fabricated Au/NTCDA/p-Si/Al photodiode is explained in a detailed manner and has shown an excellent responsivity and detectivity for UV light of intensities ranging from 20 to 80mW/cm2. A linear current-irradiance relationship is exhibited by the fabricated photodiode under illumination up to 65mW/cm2. It also shows good response times of trise = 408ms and tfall= 490ms. Furthermore, we have not only fitted the characteristic I-V curve but also evaluated three classical algorithms; K-Nearest Neighbour, Artificial Neural Network, and Genetic Programming besides using a Quantum Neural Network to predict the behavior of the device. The models have achieved outstanding results and managed to capture the trend of the target values. The Quantum Neural Network has been used for the first time to model the photodiode characteristics. The trained models are of great significance since they can be used to reduce the characterization and measurement times.

TI Entanglement echo and dynamical entanglement transitions
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB We formulate dynamical phase transitions in subsystems embedded in larger quantum systems. Introducing the entanglement echo as an overlap of the initial and instantaneous entanglement ground states, we show its analytic structure after a quench provides natural definition of dynamical phase transitions in the subsystem. These transitions come in two varieties: the entanglement-type transitions and the bulk-type Loschmidt transitions. The entanglement-type transitions arise from periodic reorganization of quantum correlations between the subsystem and its environment, manifesting in instantaneous entanglement ground state degeneracies. Furthermore, the entanglement echo distinguishes the direction of the quench, resolves spatially distinct dynamical phase transitions for nonuniform quenches, and give rise to sharply defined transitions for mixed initial states. We propose an experimental probe to identify entanglement-type transitions through temporal changes in subsystem fluctuations.

[Phys. Rev. B 101, 155105 (2020)], an explicit intertwiner is constructed in the form of a projected entangled pair operator. By encoding the information about the charge sectors (and if applicable the twisted boundary conditions) in ancillary qubit(s), the intertwiner becomes a unitary operator which exchanges boundary conditions and charge sectors.

TI Light-field ghost imaging
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW APPLIED
AB Techniques based on classical and quantum correlations in light beams, such as ghost imaging, allow us to overcome many limitations of conventional imaging and sensing protocols. Despite their advantages, applications of such techniques are often limited in practical scenarios where the position and the longitudinal extension of the target object are unknown. In this work, we propose and experimentally demonstrate an imaging technique, named light-field ghost imaging, that exploits light correlations and light-field imaging principles to enable going beyond the limitations of ghost imaging in a wide range of applications. Notably, our technique removes the requirement to have prior knowledge of the object distance, allowing the possibility of refocusing in postprocessing, as well as performing three-dimensional imaging while retaining all the benefits of ghost imaging protocols.

TI Optimising detector readout settings for the detection of spatial
   correlations between SPDC photon-pairs
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB SPDC photon-pairs exhibit spatial correlations which can be measured using detector arrays sensitive to single photons. However, these detector arrays have multiple readout modes and in order to optimise detection it is important to select the optimum mode to detect the correlations against a background of optical and electronic noise. These quantum correlations enable applications in imaging, sensing, communication, and optical processing. Here we compare the measurement of spatial correlations for a broad range of readout modes of an EMCCD camera and attempt to characterise the optimal readout mode for our purposes. This assessment is important for the use of detector arrays of different types for use in quantum, low-light, enhanced resolution, imaging systems.

TI Quantum semipermeable barriers: Investigating Maxwell's demon toolbox
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW E
AB We study quantum Maxwell's demon in a discrete space-time setup. We consider a collection of particles hopping on a one-dimensional chain and a semipermeable barrier that allows the particles to hop in only one direction. Our main result is a formulation of a local unitary dynamics describing the action of this barrier. Such dynamics utilizes an auxiliary system A and we study how properties of A influence the behavior of particles. An immediate consequence of unitarity is the fact that particles cannot be trapped on one side of the barrier forever, unless A is infinite. In addition, coherent superpositions and quantum correlations are affected once particles enter the confinement region. Finally, we show that initial superposition of A allows the barrier to act as a beam splitter.

TI All-Dielectric Metalens for Efficient Chiral Characterization
SO SMALL STRUCTURES
AB Efficient chiral excitation and polarization-insensitive collection are critical to the detection of Raman optical activity, the selective excitation/addressing of specific states, and quantum information processing. Traditional chiral characterization relies on bulky and expensive components such as objectives, dichroic mirrors, and waveplates, severely limiting the miniaturization and practical application of the system. Herein, a versatile all-dielectric metalens is reported for compact and efficient chirality characterization. In silicon (Si) nanopillars with large height, it is revealed that the phases of two closely spaced wavelengths can be controlled independently without crosstalk. With an optimized nanofabrication process, Si nanopillars with record-breaking aspect ratio and the corresponding multifunctional metalens have been realized experimentally. The experimental efficiencies of focusing 850 nm chiral light and 780 nm unpolarized light to the same focal point are 54% and 45% respectively, far exceeding the previous multifunctional metalenses. This work paves a key step toward compact systems for quantum information processing and spin-dependent optical detection.

TI Observation of limit torus and catastrophe point in optomechanical
   systems
SO NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB Cavity optomechanical systems have received widespread attentions because they provide a novel platform for metrology, sensing, hybrid systems and quantum information processing. Their nonlinear dynamics has rich physics and plays an important role in the application scenarios. Previous works devoted to this subject have usually focused on the self-induced oscillation and chaos, whereas other parts of the rich nonlinear-dynamics picture are almost uncharted waters. In this study, we fill this gap and report the first experimental observation of limit-torus attractor, whose dynamics exhibits a torus-like trajectory in phase space. Moreover, we investigate the sharp decrease of oscillating amplitude along the up scanning transmission spectrum, referred to as catastrophe point, for the first time. The location of catastrophe point is independent of the pump power and the coupling distance. Our findings enrich the nonlinear dynamics in optomechanical systems, and open up new ways towards exploiting these systems as versatile building blocks in various applications including communication, quantum information processing, sensing and metrology.

We contribute to such a program by establishing a precise correspondence between the quantum information formalism of tensor networks (TN), in the case of projected entangled-pair states (PEPS) generalised to a second-quantized framework, and group field theory (GFT) states, and by showing how, in this quantum gravity approach, discrete spatial manifolds arise as entanglement patterns among quanta of space, having a dual representation in terms of graphs and simplicial complexes. We devote special attention to the implementation and consequences of the label independence of the graphs/networks, corresponding to the indistinguishability of the space quanta and representing a discrete counterpart of the diffeomorphism invariance of a consistent quantum gravity formalism. We also outline a relational setting to recover distinguishability of graph/network vertices at an effective and physical level, in a partial semi-classical limit of the theory.

TI Long optical and electron spin coherence times for erbium ions in

SO NPJ QUANTUM INFORMATION
AB Spins in silicon that are accessible via a telecom-compatible optical transition are a versatile platform for quantum information processing that can leverage the well-established silicon nanofabrication industry. Key to these applications are long coherence times on the optical and spin transitions to provide a robust system for interfacing photonic and spin qubits. Here, we report telecom-compatible Er3+ sites with long optical and electron spin coherence times, measured within a nuclear spin-free silicon crystal (<0.01 % Si-29) using optical detection. We investigate two sites and find 0.1 GHz optical inhomogeneous linewidths and homogeneous linewidths below 70 kHz for both sites. We measure the electron spin coherence time of both sites using optically detected magnetic resonance and observe Hahn echo decay constants of 0.8 ms and 1.2 ms at similar to 11 mT. These optical and spin properties of Er3+:Si are an important milestone towards using optically accessible spins in silicon for a broad range of quantum information processing applications.

TI Temperature study of Rydberg exciton optical properties in
   Cu2O
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
AB Rydberg excitons in Cu2O can be an emergent platform for solid-state quantum information processing by utilizing the exaggerated properties of high-lying excited states within the material. To develop practical quantum systems, high-temperature operation is desirable. Here, we study the temperature dependence of the yellow and green Rydberg exciton resonances in a thin Cu2O crystal via broad-band phonon-assisted absorption spectra between 4 K and 100 K. At 4 K, we can identify the principal quantum number n = 11 yellow and n = 4 green Rydberg exciton states, beyond which we are limited by the spectral resolution of standard absorption techniques. Above liquid nitrogen boiling temperature (similar to 80K), the n = 6 yellow and n = 4 green Rydberg exciton states are readily captured and higher-temperature yellow Rydberg exciton optical properties still exhibit the standard scaling laws seen at low temperatures. This promising result lays the groundwork for a new route to build a high-temperature Rydberg quantum information processing architecture with solid-state Cu2O.

TI Temporal teleportation with pseudo-density operators: How dynamics
   emerges from temporal entanglement
SO SCIENCE ADVANCES
AB We show that, by using temporal quantum correlations as expressed by pseudo-density operators (PDOs), it is possible to recover formally the standard quantum dynamical evolution as a sequence of teleportations in time. We demonstrate that any completely positive evolution can be formally reconstructed by teleportation with different temporally correlated states. This provides a different interpretation of maximally correlated PDOs, as resources to induce quantum time evolution. Furthermore, we note that the possibility of this protocol stems from the strict formal correspondence between spatial and temporal entanglement in quantum theory. We proceed to demonstrate experimentally this correspondence, by showing a multipartite violation of generalized temporal and spatial Bell inequalities and verifying agreement with theoretical predictions to a high degree of accuracy, in high-quality photon qubits.

TI Modular Autonomous Virtualization System for Two-Dimensional
   Semiconductor Quantum Dot Arrays
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW X
AB Arrays of gate-defined semiconductor quantum dots are among the leading candidates for building scalable quantum processors. High-fidelity initialization, control, and readout of spin qubit registers require exquisite and targeted control over key Hamiltonian parameters that define the electrostatic environment. However, due to the tight gate pitch, capacitive crosstalk between gates hinders independent tuning of chemical potentials and interdot couplings. While virtual gates offer a practical solution, determining all the required cross-capacitance matrices accurately and efficiently in large quantum dot registers is an open challenge. Here, we establish a modular automated virtualization system (MAViS)-a general and modular framework for autonomously constructing a complete stack of multilayer virtual gates in real time. Our method employs machine learning techniques to rapidly extract features from two-dimensional charge stability diagrams. We then utilize computer vision and regression models to self-consistently determine all relative capacitive couplings necessary for virtualizing plunger and barrier gates in both low-and high-tunnel-coupling regimes. Using MAViS, we successfully demonstrate accurate virtualization of a dense two-dimensional array comprising ten quantum dots defined in a high-quality Ge/SiGe heterostructure. Our work offers an elegant and practical solution for the efficient control of large-scale semiconductor quantum dot systems.

AB Pebble games are usually used to study space/time tradeoffs. Recently, spooky pebble games were introduced to study classical space/quantum space/time trade-offs for simulation of classical circuits on quantum computers. In this paper, the spooky pebble game framework is applied for the first time to general circuits. Using this framework we prove an upper bound for quantum space in the spooky pebble game. Moreover, we present a solver for the spooky pebble game based on a SAT solver. This spooky pebble game solver is empirically evaluated by calculating optimal classical space/quantum space/time trade-offs. Within limited runtime, the solver could find a strategy reducing quantum space when classical space is taken into account, showing that the spooky pebble model is useful to reduce quantum space.

TI Blockchain-Based Cloud Data Integrity Verification Scheme with High
   Efficiency
SO SECURITY AND COMMUNICATION NETWORKS
AB With the large-scale application of cloud storage, how to ensure cloud data integrity has become an important issue. Although many methods have been proposed, they still have their limitations. This paper improves some defects of the previous methods and proposes an efficient cloud data integrity verification scheme based on blockchain. In this paper, we proposed a lattice signature algorithm to resist quantum computing and introduced cuckoo filter to simplify the computational overhead of the user verification phase. Finally, the decentralized blockchain network is introduced to replace traditional centralized audit to publicize and authenticate the verification results, which improves the transparency and the security of this scheme. Security analysis shows that our scheme can resist malicious attacks and experimental results show that our scheme has high efficiency, especially in the user verification phase.

TI Dynamical Properties of Plasmon Polaritons in Nanorings Driven by
   Cassini-Ordered Emitters
SO NANOMATERIALS
AB The dynamics of plasmon polaritons (PPs) in a periodic lattice of dispersed nanorings (NRs) with embedded quantum nanoemitters (NEs) arranged according to the Cassini-Bernoulli lemniscate (LB) is studied. The field structure and the dynamics of the NE (quantum polarization) depend significantly on the plasma frequency omega p of the NR. We show that in the vicinity of the intersection of the LB branches (a region of high emitter density) located in the nanoring gaps, there is a significant enhancement of the optical field intensity and quantum correlations in the emitter subsystem. This effect may allow the coherent amplification of terahertz PPs (studied recently via free-electron-stimulated emission) in a lattice of NRs with the emission of embedded NEs.

TI Violation of LGtI inequalities in the light of NOνA and T2K anomaly
SO EUROPEAN PHYSICAL JOURNAL C
AB The recent anomaly observed in NOvA and T2Kexperiments in standard three-flavor neutrino oscillation could potentially signal physics extending beyond the standard-model (SM). For theNSI parameters that can accommodate this anomaly, we explore the violation of Leggett-Garg type inequalities (LGtI) within the context of three-flavor neutrino oscillations. Our analysis focuses on LGtI violations in scenarios involving complex NSI with coupling in long baseline accelerator experiments for normal and inverted mass ordering. LGtI violation is significantly enhanced in normal ordering (NO) for scenario for T2K, NOvA, and DUNE experiment set-up. We find that for inverted ordering (IO), in the DUNE experimental set-up above 8.5 GeV, the LGtI violation can be an indication of new physics scenario.

TI Enhanced Gaussian interferometric power, entanglement and Gaussian
   quantum steering in magnonics system with squeezed light
SO PHYSICS LETTERS A
AB In this study, we propose a scheme to improve quantum correlations (QCs) between two magnons in a tripartite magnonical system. We use Gaussian interferometric power (GIP) to quantify QCs beyond entanglement. Additionally, Gaussian quantum steering is discussed. We investigate the enhancement of QCs via a squeezing parameter and an optical parametric amplifier (OPA). The Mancini criterion is considered to confirm the presence of shared entanglement between the two magnons. We observed a squeezing of about 7 dB for the first magnon. Additionally, the squeezed vacuum field and the OPA improve the generation of genuine tripartite entanglement. We hope that current experimental technology will allow the proposed scheme to be implemented.

This contribution presents new results from NA61/SHINE on fluctuations and correlations which include in particular quantum correlations, as well as multiplicity and net-charge fluctuations, proton density fluctuations and anisotropic collective flow.

AB We demonstrate cryogenic switching devices based on HEMT technology for scalable quantum computer (QC) control and readout signal routing. The switches are implemented in a quantum well network design without metal contacts between gates, and exhibit extremely steep cryogenic subthreshold swing of similar to 5 mV/decade, fast switching, along with on/off ratio of 10(7) and isolation leakage of 10 pA/mu m. The use of a Pt gate metal layer that diffuses into the gate barrier is shown to significantly enhance subthreshold properties. The results indicate that HEMT-based switching circuits could offer advantages over Si CMOS at cryogenic temperatures for future high-density ultra-low power QC signal routing.

AB The ability to convert the spatial mode of single photons opens up a promising path to enhancing quantum communication protocols by enabling high-dimensional encoding and efficient multiplexing.

The characterization of the converted single photons was carried out using a time-of-flight technique and coincidence measurements, by taking advantage of the differences in group velocity between the modes. We also performed loss measurements at the single-photon level and demonstrated mode re-conversion by using a second LPG to restore the photons back to the fundamental mode. These results highlight the potential of LPGs as a versatile tool for spatial mode manipulation at the single-photon level, with applications in high-dimensional quantum communication and nonlinear optical interactions.

TI Impact of surface and laser-induced noise on the spectral stability of
   implanted nitrogen-vacancy centers in diamond
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
AB Scalable realizations of quantum network technologies utilizing the nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center in diamond require creation of optically coherent NV centers in close proximity to a surface for coupling to optical structures. We create single NV centers by N-15 ion implantation and high-temperature vacuum annealing. The origin of the NV centers is established by optically detected magnetic resonance spectroscopy for nitrogen isotope identification. Near-lifetime-limited optical linewidths (<60 MHz) are observed for the majority of the normal-implant (7 degrees, approximate to 100 nm deep) (NV)-N-15 centers. Long-term stability of the NV- charge state and emission frequency is demonstrated. The effect of NV-surface interaction is investigated by varying the implantation angle for a fixed ion energy, and thus lattice damage profile. In contrast to the normal-implant condition, NVs from an oblique implant (85 degrees, approximate to 20 nm deep) exhibit substantially reduced optical coherence. Our results imply that the surface is a larger source of perturbation than implantation damage for shallow implanted NVs. This work supports the viability of ion implantation for formation of optically stable NV centers. However, careful surface preparation will be necessary for scalable defect engineering.

TI Eliminating thermal infrared background noise by imaging with undetected
   photons
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Spectroscopy and imaging in the mid-infrared (2.5 mu m similar to lambda similar to 25 mu m) is bedeviled by the presence of a strong 300-K thermal background at room temperature that makes infrared (IR) detectors decades noisier than can be readily achieved in the visible. The technique of imaging with undetected photons (IUP) exploits the quantum correlations between entangled photon pairs to transfer image information from one spectral region to another, and here we show that it does so in a way that is immune to the thermal background. This means that IUP can be used to perform high-speed photon-counting measurements across the mid-IR spectrum, using uncooled visible detectors that are many times cheaper, faster, and more sensitive than their IR counterparts.

TI Bell nonlocality in maximal-length quantum mechanics
SO PHYSICS LETTERS B
AB In this paper, we investigate the consequences of maximal length as well as minimal momentum scales on nonlocal correlations shared by two parties of a bipartite quantum system. To this aim, we rely on a general phenomenological scheme which is usually associated with the non-negligible spacetime curvature at cosmological scales, namely the extended uncertainty principle. In so doing, we find that quantum correlations are degraded if the deformed quantum mechanical model mimics a positive cosmological constant. This opens up the possibility to recover classicality at sufficiently large distances.& COPY; 2023 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier B.V.

TI Ability of unbounded pairs of observers to achieve quantum advantage in
   random access codes with a single pair of qubits
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Complications in preparing and preserving quantum correlations stimulate recycling of a single quantum resource in information processing and communication tasks multiple times. Here, we consider a scenario involving multiple independent pairs of observers acting with unbiased inputs on a single pair of spatially separated qubits sequentially. In this scenario, we address whether more than one pair of observers can demonstrate quantum advantage in some specific 2 -> 1 and 3 -> 1 random access codes. Interestingly, we not only address these in the affirmative but also illustrate that unbounded pairs can exhibit quantum advantage. Furthermore, these results remain valid even when all observers perform suitable projective measurements and an appropriate separable state is initially shared.

AB Using Bell inequalities as a tool to explore non-classical physical behaviours, in this paper we analyse what one can expect to find in many-body quantum physics. Concretely, framing the usual correlation scenarios as a concrete spin lattice, we want to know whether or not it is possible to violate a Bell inequality restricted to this scenario. Using clustering theorems, we are able to show that a large family of quantum many-body systems behave almost-locally, violating Bell inequalities (if so) only by a non-significant amount. We also provide examples, explain some of our assumptions via counter-examples and present all the proofs for our results. We hope the paper is self-contained.

AB Most efficient state-vector quantum simulation frameworks are imperative. They work by having circuit gates operate on the global state vector in sequence and with each gate operation accessing and updating, in parallel, all (or large subsets of) the elements of the state vector. The precise access and update patterns used by a particular gate operation depend on which qubits the individual gate operates on.
   Imperative implementations of state-vector simulators, however, often lack a more declarative specification, which may hinder reasoning and optimisations. For instance, correctness is often argued for using reasoning that involves bit-operations on state-vector indexes, which make it difficult for compilers to perform high-level index-optimisations.
   In this work, we demonstrate how gate operations can be understood as maps over index-transformed state-vectors. We demonstrate correctness of the approach and implement a library for gate-operations in the data-parallel programming language Futhark. We further demonstrate that Futhark's fusion-engine is sufficiently powerful that it will ensure that consecutive gate operations on identical qubits are fused using map-map fusion. Moreover, we demonstrate that, using Futhark's uniqueness type system, state vectors may be updated in place. We evaluate the approach by comparing it with the state-of-the art state-vector simulators qsim and QuEST.

TI Generation of multipartite entanglement in a cavity-magnomechanical
   system
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB Generating multipartite entanglement is always a popular research field in quantum information processing and quantum optics. In this paper, we propose a scheme to realize all bipartite entanglements and the genuine tripartite entanglement among photon, magnon, and phonon modes in a cavity-magnomechanical system. The center-of-mass motion of a yttrium iron garnet sphere couples to the magnon and constitutes photon-magnon-phonon tripartite interaction. By modulating the detuning between the cavity (magnon) mode and the driven field, we can obtain the optimal photon-phonon entanglement or magnon-phonon entanglement. The genuine tripartite entanglement can be prepared through a suitable detuning. We compare the different entanglement cases with and without effective direct cavity-magnon coupling. The results indicate that the photon-magnon entanglement can be enhanced by the effective cavity-magnon coupling strength, and all bipartite entanglements show greater robustness against the thermal phonon number. This investigation should be useful for phonon-involved multipartite quantum information processing and quantum precision measurement.

TI Evolution of Consciousness
SO LIFE-BASEL
AB The natural evolution of consciousness in different animal species mandates that conscious experiences are causally potent in order to confer any advantage in the struggle for survival. Any endeavor to construct a physical theory of consciousness based on emergence within the framework of classical physics, however, leads to causally impotent conscious experiences in direct contradiction to evolutionary theory since epiphenomenal consciousness cannot evolve through natural selection. Here, we review recent theoretical advances in describing sentience and free will as fundamental aspects of reality granted by quantum physical laws. Modern quantum information theory considers quantum states as a physical resource that endows quantum systems with the capacity to perform physical tasks that are classically impossible. Reductive identification of conscious experiences with the quantum information comprised in quantum brain states allows for causally potent consciousness that is capable of performing genuine choices for future courses of physical action. The consequent evolution of brain cortical networks contributes to increased computational power, memory capacity, and cognitive intelligence of the living organisms.

TI Experimental 61-partite entanglement on a three-dimensional photonic
   chip
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB Multipartite entanglements are essential resources for proceeding tasks in quantum information science and technology. However, generating and verifying them present significant challenges, such as the stringent requirements for manipulations and the need for a huge number of building-blocks as the systems scale up. Here, we propose and experimentally demonstrate the heralded multipartite entanglements on a three-dimensional photonic chip. Integrated photonics provide a physically scalable way to achieve an extensive and adjustable architecture. Through sophisticated Hamiltonian engineering, we are able to control the coherent evolution of shared single photon in the multiple spatial modes, dynamically tuning the induced high-order W-states of different orders in a single photonic chip. Using an effective witness, we successfully observe and verify 61-partite quantum entanglements in a 121-site photonic lattice. Our results, together with the single-site-addressable platform, offer new insights into the accessible size of quantum entanglements and may facilitate the developments of large-scale quantum information processing applications.

TI Coupling Perovskite Quantum Dot Pairs in Solution using a Nanoplasmonic
   Assembly
SO NANO LETTERS
AB ABSTRACT: Perovskite quantum dots (PQDs) provide a robust solution-based approach to efficient solar cells, bright light emitting devices, and quantum sources of light. Quantifying heterogeneity and understanding coupling between dots is critical for these applications. We use double-nanohole optical trapping to size individual dots and correlate to emission energy shifts from quantum confinement. We were able to assemble a second dot in the trap, which allows us to observe the coupling between dots. We observe a systematic red-shift of 1.1 +/- 0.6 meV in the emission wavelength. Theoretical analysis shows that the observed shift is consistent with resonant energy transfer and is unusually large due to moderate-to-large quantum confinement in PQDs. This demonstrates the promise of PQDs for entanglement in quantum information applications. This work enables future in situ control of PQD growth as well as studies of the coupling between small PQD assemblies with quantum information applications in mind.

TI Crossing exceptional points in non-Hermitian quantum systems
SO SCIENCE ADVANCES
AB Exceptional points facilitate peculiar dynamics in non-Hermitian systems. Yet, in photonics, they have mainly been studied in the classical realm. In this work, we reveal the behavior of two-photon quantum states in non-Hermitian systems across the exceptional point. We probe the lossy directional coupler with an indistinguishable two-photon input state and observe distinct changes of the quantum correlations at the output as the system undergoes spontaneous breaking of parity-time symmetry. Moreover, we demonstrate a switching in the quantum interference of photons directly at the exceptional point, where Hong-Ou-Mandel dips are transformed into peaks by a change of basis. These results show that quantum interference and exceptional points are linked in curious ways that can now be further explored.

TI Graphene nanoribbons for quantum electronics
SO NATURE REVIEWS PHYSICS
AB Graphene nanoribbons are an emerging class of 1D materials hosting rich quantum-confined and topological states. This Perspective discusses recent breakthroughs in graphene nanoribbon materials and devices, and identifies key challenges towards electronics and quantum information applications.
   Graphene nanoribbons (GNRs) are a family of one-dimensional (1D) materials with a graphitic lattice structure. GNRs possess high mobility and current-carrying capability, sizeable bandgap and versatile electronic properties, which make them promising candidates for quantum electronic applications. In the past 5 years, progress has been made towards atomically precise bottom-up synthesis of GNRs and heterojunctions that provide an ideal platform for functional molecular devices, as well as successful production of semiconducting GNR arrays on insulating substrates potentially useful for large-scale digital circuits. With further development, GNRs can be envisioned as a competitive candidate material in future quantum information sciences. In this Perspective, we discuss recent progress in GNR research and identify key challenges and new directions likely to develop in the near future.

TI Monolithically Integrated Quantum Dots in a 22-nm Fully Depleted
   Silicon-on-Insulator Process Operating at 3 K
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CIRCUIT THEORY AND APPLICATIONS
AB Quantum computers comprising large-scale arrays of qubits will enable complex algorithms to be executed to provide a quantum advantage for practical applications. A prerequisite for this milestone is a power-efficient qubit control and detection system operating at cryogenic temperatures. Implementing such systems in complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) technology offers clear advantages in terms of scalability. Here, we present a fully integrated quantum dot array in which silicon quantum wells are co-located with control and detection circuitry on the same die in a commercial 22-nm fully depleted silicon-on-insulator (FDSOI) process. Our system comprises a two-dimensional quantum dot array, integrated with 8 detectors and 32 injectors, operating at 3 K inside a cryo-cooler. The power consumption of the control and detection circuitry is 2.5 mW per qubit without body biasing. The design utilizes 0.8-V nominal Vt$$ {V}_t $$ devices. The setup allows us to verify discrete charge injection control and detection at the quantum dot array and demonstrate the feasibility of this architecture for scaling up the existing quantum core to hundreds and thousands of physical qubits.

TI Global entanglement in a topological quantum phase transition
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB A useful approach to characterize and identify quantum phase transitions lies in the concept of multipartite entanglement. In this paper, we consider well-known measures of multipartite (global) entanglement, i.e., average linear entropy of one-qubit and two-qubit reduced density matrices, in order to study topological quantum phase transition (TQPT) in the Kitaev Toric code Hamiltonian with a nonlinear perturbation. We provide an exact mapping from aforementioned measures in the above model to internal energy and energy-energy correlations in the classical Ising model. Accordingly, we find that the global entanglement shows a continuous and sharp transition from a maximum value in the topological phase to zero in the magnetized phase in a sense that its first-order derivative diverges at the transition point. In this regard, we conclude that not only can the global entanglement serve as a reasonable tool to probe quantum criticality at TQPTs, but it also can reveal the highly entangled nature of topological phases. Furthermore, we also introduce a conditional version of global entanglement which becomes maximum at the critical point. Therefore, regarding a general expectation that multipartite entanglement reaches maximum value at the critical point of quantum many-body systems, our result proposes that the conditional global entanglement can be a good measure of multipartite entanglement in TQPTs.

TI Detecting Entanglement Structure in Continuous Many-Body Quantum Systems
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB A prerequisite for the comprehensive understanding of many-body quantum systems is a characteri-zation in terms of their entanglement structure. The experimental detection of entanglement in spatially extended many-body systems describable by quantum fields still presents a major challenge. We develop a general scheme for certifying entanglement and demonstrate it by revealing entanglement between distinct subsystems of a spinor Bose-Einstein condensate. Our scheme builds on the spatially resolved simultaneous detection of the quantum field in two conjugate observables which allows the experimental confirmation of quantum correlations between local as well as nonlocal partitions of the system. The detection of squeezing in Bogoliubov modes in a multimode setting illustrates its potential to boost the capabilities of quantum simulations to study entanglement in spatially extended many-body systems.

TI Refining the understanding of operator size dynamics in open quantum
   systems
SO JOURNAL OF HIGH ENERGY PHYSICS
AB Information scrambling refers to the phenomenon in which local quantum information in a many-body system becomes dispersed throughout the entire system under unitary evolution. It has been extensively studied in closed quantum systems, where it is quantified by operator size growth, revealing deep connections between condensed matter physics, high-energy physics, and quantum information. However, when extending the study of operator size dynamics to open quantum systems, two different definitions of operator size distributions emerge. These definitions are based on different treatments of the bath. In this work, we aim to establish a unified picture for operator size dynamics in open quantum systems, using the solvable Brownian SYK models at generic system size. In particular, we provide the conditions under which the signature of scrambling transition - discovered using one particular definition - appears in operator size dynamics under the other definition. Additionally, we extend previous studies by exploring finite-size effects that are not captured by the scramblon theory. Our results provide a refined understanding of operator size dynamics in open quantum systems.

TI Universal interference-based construction of Gaussian operations in
   hybrid quantum systems
SO NPJ QUANTUM INFORMATION
AB Beam-splitter operations are an indispensable resource for processing quantum information encoded in bosonic modes. In hybrid quantum systems, however, it can be challenging to implement reliable beam-splitters between two distinct modes due to various experimental imperfections. Without beam-splitters, realizing arbitrary Gaussian operations between bosonic modes can become highly non-trivial or even infeasible. In this work, we develop interference-based protocols for engineering Gaussian operations in multi-mode hybrid bosonic systems without requiring beam-splitters. Specifically, for a given generic multi-mode Gaussian unitary coupler, we demonstrate a universal scheme for constructing Gaussian operations on a desired subset of the modes, requiring only multiple uses of the given coupler interleaved with single-mode Gaussian unitaries. Our results provide efficient construction of operations crucial to quantum information science, and are derived from fundamental physical properties of bosonic systems. The proposed scheme is thus widely applicable to existing platforms and couplers, with the exception of certain edge cases. We introduce a systematic approach to identify and treat these edge cases by utilizing an intrinsically invariant structure associated with our interference-based construction.

TI Strong tunable spin-spin interaction in a weakly coupled nitrogen
   vacancy spin-cavity electromechanical system
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
AB The long coherence time of a single nitrogen vacancy (NV) center spin in diamond is a crucial advantage for implementing quantum information processing. However, the realization of strong coupling between single NV spins is challenging. Here, we propose a method to greatly enhance the interaction between two single NV spins in diamond which are only weakly coupled to an electromechanical cavity. Owing to the presence of a critical point for the linearized electromechanical subsystem, the coupling between a single NV spin and the high-frequency polariton (formed by the mechanical and cavity modes) can be fully decoupled, but the coupling between the single NV spin and the low-frequency polariton is, however, greatly enhanced. Thus, AC Stark shift of the single NV spin can be measured. With the low-frequency polariton as a quantum bus, a strong coupling between two single NV centers is achievable. This effective strong coupling can ensure coherent quantum-information exchange between two spin qubits in the weakly coupled spin-cavity electromechanical system.

SO PHYSICAL REVIEW E
AB Quantum technologies and experiments often require preparing systems in low-temperature states. Here we investigate cooling schemes using feedback protocols modeled with a quantum Fokker-Planck master equation describes systems under continuous weak measurements, with feedback based on the outcome of these measurements. We apply this formalism to study the cooling and trapping of a harmonic oscillator for several protocols based on position and/or momentum measurements. We find that the protocols can cool the oscillator down to, or close to, the ground state for suitable choices of parameters. Our analysis provides an analytically solvable case study of quantum measurement and feedback and illustrates the application of the QFPME to continuous quantum systems.

AB Temporal metamaterials, based on time-varying constitutive properties, offer new exciting possibilities for advanced field manipulations. In this study, we explore the capabilities of anisotropic temporal slabs, which rely on abrupt changes in time from isotropic to anisotropic response (and vice versa). Our findings show that these platforms can effectively manipulate the wave-spin dimension, allowing for a range of intriguing spin-controlled photonic operations. We demonstrate these capabilities through examples of spin-dependent analog computing and spin-orbit interaction effects for vortex generation. These results provide new insights into the field of temporal metamaterials, and suggest potential applications in communications, optical processing and quantum technologies.

TI Many-body quantum thermal machines
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICS-CONDENSED MATTER
AB Thermodynamics of quantum systems and quantum thermal machines are rapidly developing fields, which have already delivered several promising results, as well as raised many intriguing questions. Many-body quantum machines present new opportunities stemming from many-body effects. At the same time, they pose new challenges related to many-body physics. In this short review we discuss some of the recent developments on technologies based on many-body quantum systems. We mainly focus on many-body effects in quantum thermal machines. We also briefly address the role played by many-body systems in the development of quantum batteries and quantum probes.

TI Realization of high-fidelity unitary operations on up to 64 frequency
   bins
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB The ability to apply user-chosen large-scale unitary operations with high fidelity to a quantum state is key to realizing future photonic quantum technologies. Here, we realize the implementation of programmable unitary operations on up to 64 frequency-bin modes. To benchmark the performance of our system, we probe different quantum walk unitary operations, in particular, Grover walks on four-dimensional hypercubes with similarities exceeding 95% and quantum walks with 400 steps on circles and finite lines with similarities of 98%. Our results open a path toward implementing high-quality unitary operations, which can form the basis for applications in complex tasks, such as Gaussian boson sampling.

TI Rydberg Atom-Enabled Spectroscopy of Polar Molecules via Fo?rster
   Resonance Energy Transfer
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY LETTERS
AB Non-radiative energy transfer between a Rydberg atom and a polar molecule can be controlled by a static electric field. Here, we show how to exploit this control for state-resolved, non-destructive detection and spectroscopy of the molecules, where the lineshape reflects the type of molecular transition. Using the example of ammonia, we identify the conditions for collision-mediated spectroscopy in terms of the required electric field strengths, relative velocities, and molecular densities. Rydberg atom-enabled spectroscopy is feasible with current experimental technology, providing a versatile detection method as a basic building block for applications of polar molecules in quantum technologies and chemical reaction studies.

TI Perspective on traveling wave microwave parametric amplifiers
SO APPLIED PHYSICS LETTERS
AB Quantum-limited microwave parametric amplifiers are genuine key pillars for rising quantum technologies and, in general, for applications that rely on the successful readout of weak microwave signals by adding only the minimum amount of noise allowed by quantum mechanics. In this Perspective, after providing a brief overview on the different families of parametric microwave amplifiers, we focus on traveling wave parametric amplifiers, underlining the key achievements of the last few years and the present open challenges. We also discuss possible new research directions beyond amplification such as exploring these devices as a platform for multi-mode entanglement generation and for the development of single photon detectors.

TI Kibble-Zurek mechanism and errors of gapped quantum phases
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
AB Kibble-Zurek mechanism relates the domain of nonequilibrium dynamics with the critical properties at equilibrium. It establishes a power law connection between nonequilibrium defects quenched through a continuous phase transition and the quench rate via the scaling exponent. We present a novel numerical scheme to estimate the scaling exponent wherein the notion of defects is mapped to errors, previously introduced to quantify a variety of gapped quantum phases. To demonstrate the versatility of our method we conduct numerical experiments across a broad spectrum of spin-half models hosting local and symmetry protected topological order. Furthermore, an implementation of the quench dynamics featuring a topological phase transition on a digital quantum computer is proposed to quantify the associated criticality.

TI Weakly measured while loops: peeking at quantum states
SO QUANTUM SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB A while loop tests a termination condition on every iteration. On a quantum computer, such measurements perturb the evolution of the algorithm. We define a while loop primitive using weak measurements, offering a trade-off between the perturbation caused and the amount of information gained per iteration. This trade-off is adjusted with a parameter set by the programmer. We provide sufficient conditions that let us determine, with arbitrarily high probability, a worst-case estimate of the number of iterations the loop will run for. As an example, we solve Grover's search problem using a while loop and prove the quadratic quantum speed-up is maintained.

TI Improved parameter optimization method for measurement device
   independent protocol
SO ACTA PHYSICA SINICA
AB The optimal selection of parameters in practical quantum key distribution can greatly improve the key generation rate and maximum transmission distance of the system. Owing to the high cost of global search algorithm, local search algorithm is widely used. However, there are two shortcomings in local search algorithm. One is that the solution obtained is not always the global optimal solution, and the other is that the effectiveness of the algorithm is greatly dependent on the choice of initial value. This paper uses the Monte Carlo method to prove whether the key generation rate function is convex, and also simulates and analyzes the projection of the key generation rate function on each dimension of the parameter, in contrast to the approach in previous article. In order to eliminate the effect of the initial value, this paper proposes the particle swarm local search optimization algorithm which integrates particle swarm optimization algorithm and local search algorithm. The first step is to use the particle swarm optimization to find a valid parameter which leads to nonzero key generation rate, and the second step is to adopt the parameter as the initial value of local search algorithm to derive the global optimal solution. Then, the two algorithms are used to conduct simulation and their results are compared. The results show that the key generation rate function is non-convex because it does not satisfy the definition of a convex function, however, since the key generation rate function has only one nonzero stagnation point, the LSA algorithm can still obtain the global optimal solution with an appropriate initial value. When the transmission distance is relatively long, the local search algorithm is invalid because it is difficult to obtain an effective initial value by random value method. The particle swarm optimization algorithm can overcome this shortcoming and improve the maximum transmission distance of the system at the cost of slightly increasing the complexity of the algorithm.

TI Molding Photon Emission with Hybrid Plasmon-Emitter Coupled Metasurfaces
SO ADVANCED OPTICAL MATERIALS
AB Directional emission of photons with designed polarizations and orbital angular momenta is crucial for exploiting the full potential of quantum emitters (QEs) within quantum information technologies. Capitalizing on the concept of hybrid plasmon-QE coupled metasurfaces, a holography-based design approach is developed allowing one to construct surface nanostructures for outcoupling QE-excited circularly diverging surface plasmon polaritons (SPPs) into well-collimated beams of photons with desirable polarization characteristics propagating along given directions. Using the well-established simulation framework, the efficiency and versatility of the developed approach are demonstrated by analyzing different hybrid SPP-QE coupled metasurfaces designed for the generation of linearly, radially, and circularly polarized photons propagating in various off-axis directions. This work enables the design of single-photon sources with radiation channels that have distinct directional and polarization characteristics, extending thereby possibilities for designing complex photonic systems for quantum information processing. Moreover, it is believed that the developed scattering holography approach is generally useful when employing surface electromagnetic excitations, including SPP modes, as reference waves for signal wave reconstruction.

TI Zero-energy modes in a super-chiral nanographene network of
   phenalenyl-tessellation molecules
SO PHYSICS LETTERS A
AB We have derived a general rule for the appearance of zero-energy modes in super-chiral defective nanographene. This "super-zero-sum rule" defines the appearance of zero modes in a new class of materials, called polymerized phenalenyl-tessellation molecules (poly-PTMs). Through theoretical modeling of the electronic states in these molecular forms, we provide concrete solutions for achieving the quantum-spin systems needed in quantum-information devices. The two-dimensional graph of electronic pi-orbitals in the poly-PTM possesses a number of localized zero modes equivalent to that of vacancies in PTMs. In addition to the modes confined to each PTM, another type of zero mode may appear according to the super-zero-sum rule supported by super-chirality. Since the magnetic interactions among quantum-spins in the zero modes are determined by how they appear (which is governed by the super-zero-sum rule), our rule is indispensable for designing quantum-information devices using zero modes in poly-aromatic hydrocarbons and defective graphene with vacancies.

The proposed scheme allows for changing the message signature threshold, thereby improving the flexibility of the original Damgaard scheme. This scheme can be applied as a user authentication system using wearable devices. Based on the hardness of lattice problems, this scheme is resistant to attacks on a quantum computer, which is an advantage over the currently used multi-factor authentication schemes. The scheme's security relies on the computational complexity of the Module-LWE and Module-SIS problems, as well as the Shamir secret sharing scheme's security.

TI Quantum nonlocality in extended theories of gravity
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW D
AB We investigate how pure-state Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen correlations in the internal degrees of freedom of massive particles are affected by a curved spacetime background described by extended theories of gravity. We consider models for which the corrections to the Einstein-Hilbert action are quadratic in the curvature invariants and we focus on the weak-field limit. We quantify nonlocal quantum correlations by means of the violation of the Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt inequality, and show how a curved background suppresses the violation by a leading term due to general relativity and a further contribution due to the corrections to Einstein gravity. Our results can be generalized to massless particles such as photon pairs and can thus be suitably exploited to devise precise experimental tests of extended models of gravity.

TI Quantum Monogamy with Predetermined Events
SO QUANTUM REPORTS
AB The concept of correlation appears straightforward: measurement outcomes coincide, and patterns emerge. For any record of events, the coefficients are uniquely determined. Thus, if correlations change spontaneously, as seen in quantum monogamy, then individual behavior must have changed first. Surprisingly, this is not always true. When two observables are mutually exclusive, they cannot coincide objectively and need to be grouped across time. Yet, sectioning the flow of events into "iterations" is not trivial in this case. Even with blind windows of coincidence, the same order of outcomes can produce different coefficients of correlation, depending on the number of joint measurements. Therefore, quantum monogamy can happen with fixed pre-determined events. A new concept ("subjective correlation") is required to explain this phenomenon.

TI Non-Hermitian strong bosonic clustering through interaction-induced
   caging
SO COMMUNICATIONS PHYSICS
AB Guiding how interacting bosons gather at system boundaries underpins emerging quantum technologies. However, how the triple interplay of directional non-Hermitian hopping, bosonic repulsion, and band topology shapes such clustering is still not fully understood. Here we show that these ingredients cooperate to produce an emergent "cage" that traps bosons at a lattice edge, yielding system boundary densities far beyond those from interaction-induced trapping alone. This caging extends from our two-boson minimal model to many-body systems over broad interaction strengths and hopping asymmetries. The mechanism offers a general strategy to pin correlated particles without external barriers and could inform future designs of robust edge memories and energy-efficient transport devices.

TI Purcell-enhanced dipolar interactions in nanostructures
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Strong light-induced interactions between atoms are known to cause nonlinearities at a few-photon level, which are crucial for applications in quantum information processing. Compared to free space, the scattering and the light-induced dipolar interaction of atoms can be enhanced by a dielectric environment. For this Purcell effect, either a cavity or a waveguide can be used. Here, we combine the high densities achievable in thermal atomic vapors with an efficient coupling to a slot waveguide. In contrast to free-space interactions, atoms aligned within the slot exhibit repulsive interactions that are further enhanced by a factor of 8 due to the Purcell effect. The corresponding blueshift of the transition frequency of atoms arranged in the essentially one-dimensional geometry vanishes above the saturation, providing a controllable nonlinearity at the few-photon level. The experimental results are in good agreement with Monte Carlo simulations that include the dielectric environment, dipolar interactions, and motional effects. The results pave the way towards a robust scalable platform for quantum nonlinear optics and all-optical quantum information processing at room temperature.

TI Optimizing finite-time photon extraction from emitter-cavity systems

AB We develop methods to find the limits to finite-time single photon extraction from emitter-cavity systems. We first establish analytic upper and lower bounds on the maximum extraction probability from a canonical A-system before developing a numeric method to optimize generic output probabilities from A-systems generalized to multiple ground states. We use these methods to study the limits to finite-time photon extraction and the wavepackets that satisfy them, finding that using an optimized wavepacket ranging between a sinusoidal and exponentially decaying profile can considerably reduce photon duration for a given extraction efficiency. We further optimize the rates of quantum protocols requiring emitter-photon correlation to obtain driving-independent conclusions about the effect of system parameters on success probability. We believe that these results and methods will provide valuable tools and insights for the development of cavity-based single photon sources combining high efficiency and high rate.

TI A mesoscopic device for a realization of the topological Kondo effect
SO NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB The search for anyons is a field of immense interest owing to its potential application in the field of quantum information. Quantum critical Kondo impurities constitute one possible platform for their realization and topological Kondo effect (TKE) by virtue of remaining critical in the presence of perturbations, seems to be especially promising in this regard. In this paper we discuss practical steps for a realization of TKE with a relatively high Kondo temperature TK. Its central feature is the so-called Majorana-Cooper box (MCB) and we argue that a particular type of iron-based topological superconductor is especially suitable for realization of TKE. Once MCB is available one needs to connect it to external metallic leads to produce TKE. A relatively high value of the Kondo temperature TK is then aided by a large superconducting gap of the iron-based superconductor. We give estimates for TK, for the cases of both isotropic and anisotropic exchange couplings of MCB with the leads.

TI Time-resolved two-photon interference of weak coherent pulses
SO APPLIED PHYSICS LETTERS
AB The observation of the Hong-Ou-Mandel (HOM)-type two-photon interference (TPI) has played an important role in the development of photonic quantum technologies. The time-resolved coincidence-detection technique has been effectively used to identify and characterize the TPI phenomena of long-coherence optical fields. Here, we report on the experimental demonstration of the TPI of two phase-randomized weak coherent pulses with time-resolved coincidence detection. The mutual coherence time between the two weak coherent lights is determined by applying a frequency noise to one of the two interfering lights. We analyze the HOM-type TPI fringe visibility according to the ratio of the coherence time to the pulse duration.

TI Polarization entanglement enabled by orthogonally stacked van der Waals
   NbOCl2 crystals
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Polarization entanglement holds significant importance for photonic quantum technologies. Recently emerging subwavelength nonlinear quantum light sources, e.g., GaP and LiNbO3 thin films, benefiting from the relaxed phase-matching constraints and volume confinement, have shown intriguing properties, such as high-dimensional hyperentanglement and robust entanglement anti-degradation. Van der Waals (vdW) NbOCl2 crystal, with strong optical nonlinearities, has emerged as a potential candidate for ultrathin quantum light sources. However, polarization entanglement is inaccessible in the NbOCl2 crystal due to its unfavorable nonlinear susceptibility tensor. Here, by leveraging the twist-stacking degree of freedom inherently in vdW systems, we showcase the preparation of polarization entanglement and quantum Bell states.

TI Pre- and post-compensation to suppress birefringent walk-off effects of
   entangled photons
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB Photon-based entanglement sources, crucial for obtaining entangled states, are typically generated via spontaneous parametric down-conversion. However, birefringence in nonlinear crystals causes spatial or temporal walk-off, reducing entangled photon quality. The theoretical analysis attributes birefringent walk-off to dispersive materials curbed by pre- and post-compensation. We experimentally validate this method, enhancing polarization-entangled photon quality. We measured the Bell state along with a violation of CHSH-Bell's inequality by similar to 366 standard deviations (S = 2.623 +/- 0.0017). Our approach, simple and stable, does not complicate setups. Its applicability extends to optimizing various entanglement source schemes, aiding optical quantum technologies such as computation, sensing, and communication.

TI Spectrally shaped and pulse-by-pulse multiplexed multimode squeezed
   states of light
SO APL PHOTONICS
AB Spectral- and time-multiplexing are currently explored to generate large multipartite quantum states of light for quantum technologies. In the continuous variable approach, the deterministic generation of scalable entangled states requires the generation of a scalable number of squeezed modes. Here, we demonstrate the simultaneous generation of 21 squeezed spectral modes at the repetition rate of our laser, i.e., 156 MHz. We exploit the full repetition rate and the pulse shaping of a femtosecond light source to combine, for the first time, frequency- and time-multiplexing in multimode squeezing. This paves the way for the implementation of multipartite entangled states that are both scalable and fully reconfigurable.

TI Optomechanical two-photon hopping
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB The hopping mechanism plays a key role in collective phenomena emerging in many-body physics. The ability to create and control systems that display this feature is important for next generation quantum technologies. Here we study two cavities separated by a vibrating two-sided perfect mirror and show that, within currently available experimental parameters, this system displays photon-pair hopping between the two electromagnetic resonators. In particular, the two-photon hopping is not due to tunneling, but rather to higher-order resonant processes. Starting from the classical problem we quantize the system and show this purely quantum feature. This opens the possibility to investigate a new mechanism of photon-pair propagation in optomechanical lattices.

TI Topology Abstraction-Based Routing Scheme for Secret-Key Provisioning in
   Hybrid GEO/LEO Quantum Satellite Networks
SO ENTROPY
AB Quantum key distribution (QKD) is a promising technique to resist the threat against quantum computers. However, the high loss of quantum signals over a long-distance optical fiber is an obstacle for QKD in the intercontinental domain. In this context, the quantum satellite network is preferred over the terrestrial quantum optical network. Due to the mobility of satellites, the satellite topology is dynamic in the quantum satellite network, which remains a challenge for routing. In hybrid geostationary-earth-orbit (GEO)/low-earth-orbit (LEO) quantum satellite networks, the lack of an efficient scheduling scheme for GEO/LEO satellites also limits the construction of quantum satellite networks. Therefore, this paper provides a topology abstraction-based routing scheme for secret-key provisioning, where the dynamic physical topology is translated into a quasi-static abstracted topology. This scheme contributes to saving the precious secret key resources. In order to improve the success probability of long-distance QKD requests, three novel resource-scheduling heuristic algorithms are proposed in hybrid GEO/LEO quantum satellite networks. Simulation results indicate that the proposed algorithms can improve the success probability of QKD requests by 47% compared to the benchmark.

TI Blockchain-Based SQKD and IDS in Edge Enabled Smart Grid Network
SO CMC-COMPUTERS MATERIALS & CONTINUA
AB Smart Grid is a power grid that improves flexibility, reliability, and efficiency through smart meters. Due to extensive data exchange over the Internet, the smart grid faces many security challenges that have led to data loss, data compromise, and high power consumption. Moreover, the lack of hardware protection and physical attacks reduce the overall performance of the smart grid network. We proposed the BLIDSE model (Blockchain-based secure quantum key distribution and Intrusion Detection System in Edge Enables Smart Grid Network) to address these issues. The proposed model includes five phases: The first phase is blockchain-based secure user authentication, where all smart meters are first registered in the blockchain, and then the blockchain generates a secret key. The blockchain verifies the user ID and the secret key during authentication matches the one authorized to access the network. The secret key is shared during transmission through secure quantum key distribution (SQKD). The second phase is the lightweight data encryption, for which we use a lightweight symmetric encryption algorithm, named Camellia. The third phase is the multi-constraint-based edge selection; the data are transmitted to the control center through the edge server, which is also authenticated by blockchain to enhance the security during the data transmission. We proposed a perfect matching algorithm for selecting the optimal edge. The fourth phase is a dual intrusion detection system which acts as a firewall used to drop irrelevant packets, and data packets are classified into normal, physical errors and attacks, which is done by Double Deep Q Network (DDQN). The last phase is optimal user privacy management. In this phase, smart meter updates and revocations are done, for which we proposed Forensic based Investigation Optimization (FBI), which improves the security of the smart grid network. The simulation is performed using network simulator NS3.26, which evaluates the performance in terms of computational complexity, accuracy, false detection, and false alarm rate. The proposed BLIDSE model effectively mitigates cyber-attacks, thereby contributing to improved security in the network.

TI Photon pair generation in lithium niobate waveguide periodically poled
   by femtosecond laser
SO CHINESE OPTICS LETTERS
AB Reliable generation of single photons is of key importance for fundamental physical experiments and quantum protocols. The periodically poled lithium niobate (LN) waveguide has shown promise for an integrated quantum source due to its large spectral tunability and high efficiency, benefiting from the quasi-phase-matching. Here we demonstrate photon-pair sources based on an LN waveguide periodically poled by a tightly focused femtosecond laser beam. The pair coincidence rate reaches similar to 8000 counts per second for average pump power of 3.2 mW (peak power is 2.9 kW). Our results prove the possibility of application of the nonlinear photonics structure fabricated by femtosecond laser to the integrated quantum source. This method can be extended to three-dimensional domain structures, which provide a potential platform for steer-ing the spatial degree of freedom of the entangled two-photon states.

TI Quantum reinforcement learning in the presence of thermal dissipation

AB A study of the effect of thermal dissipation on quantum reinforcement learning is performed. For this purpose, a nondissipative quantum reinforcement learning protocol is adapted to the presence of thermal dissipation. Analytical calculations as well as numerical simulations are carried out, obtaining evidence that dissipation does not significantly degrade the performance of the quantum reinforcement learning protocol for sufficiently low temperatures, in some cases even being beneficial. Quantum reinforcement learning under realistic experimental conditions of thermal dissipation opens an avenue for the realization of quantum agents to be able to interact with a changing environment, as well as adapt to it, with many plausible applications inside quantum technologies and machine learning.

TI Single G centers in silicon fabricated by co-implantation with carbon
   and proton
SO APPLIED PHYSICS LETTERS
AB We report the fabrication of isolated G centers in silicon with single photon emission at optical telecommunication wavelengths. Our sample is made from a silicon-on-insulator wafer, which is locally implanted with carbon ions and protons at various fluences. Decreasing the implantation fluences enables us to gradually switch from large ensembles to isolated single defects, reaching areal densities of G centers down to similar to 0.2 mu m(-2). Single defect creation is demonstrated by photon antibunching in intensity-correlation experiments, thus establishing our approach as an effective procedure for generating single artificial atoms in silicon for future quantum technologies.

TI Multipartite quantum correlated bright frequency combs
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB This experimental work demonstrates multipartite quantum correlation in bright frequency combs out of a microresonator integrated on silicon nitride operating above its oscillation threshold. Multipartite features, going beyond so far reported two-mode correlation, naturally arise due to a cascade of nonlinear optical processes, making a single-color laser pump sufficient to initiate their generation. Our results show the transition from two-mode to multipartite correlation, witnessed by noise reductions as low as-2.5 dB and-2 dB, respectively, compared to corresponding classical levels. A constant of the movement of the nonlinear interaction Hamiltonian is identified and used to asses the multipartite behavior. Reported demonstrations pave the way to next generation on-chip multipartite sources for quantum technologies applications.

TI Locality and entanglement of indistinguishable particles
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB Entanglement is one of the strongest quantum correlation, and is a key ingredient in fundamental aspects of quantum mechanics and a resource for quantum technologies. While entanglement theory is well settled for distinguishable particles, there are five inequivalent approaches to entanglement of indistinguishable particles. We analyse the different definitions of indistinguishable particle entanglement in the light of the locality notion. This notion is specified by two steps: (i) the identification of subsystems by means of their local operators; (ii) the requirement that entanglement represent correlations between the above subsets of operators. We prove that three of the aforementioned five entanglement definitions are incompatible with any locality notion defined as above.

For a wide range of laser parameters, the optimization of laser-induced electronic, optical and structural modifications of diamond requires quantitative understanding of the microscopic processes underlying the high electronic excitation in the material.

TI PT -Symmetric Two-Photon Quantum Rabi Models
SO ADVANCED QUANTUM TECHNOLOGIES
AB Two non-Hermitian two-photon quantum Rabi models (tpQRM) that exhibit parity-time (PT) symmetry are investigated: the biased tpQRM (btpQRM), where the qubit bias is purely imaginary, and the dissipative tpQRM (dtpQRM), where the two-photon coupling is made imaginary to introduce dissipation. For both models, exact solutions are derived using Bogoliubov transformations. In the btpQRM, spectral collapse is identified at a critical coupling strength, with accompanying PT symmetry breaking that correlates with exceptional points (EPs) arising from coalescing eigenstates. A direct correspondence is established between PT-broken regions and the doubly degenerate points of the Hermitian tpQRM, and the effect of qubit bias is analyzed via an adiabatic approximation. In the dtpQRM, although no spectral collapse occurs, both EPs and Juddian-type degeneracies are present, with distinct behaviors governed by parity conservation. Through biorthogonal fidelity susceptibility and c-product, the nature of these two types of level crossings is successfully identified and characterized. Finally, the dynamical evolution of both models is compared, revealing fundamentally different pathways to steady states governed by their respective non-Hermitian spectral structures. These results provide exact characterizations of PT-symmetric non-Hermitian tpQRMs and may offer theoretical insights for future experimental realizations.

TI Tunable accordion optical lattice for precise control of Rydberg atom
   interactions in magneto-optical traps (MOTs)
SO REVIEW OF SCIENTIFIC INSTRUMENTS
AB Precise control of Rydberg atom interactions in magneto-optical traps is essential for advanced quantum technologies, yet fine-tuning of strong Rydberg interactions remains challenging. To address this, we present a tunable accordion optical lattice with dynamically adjustable lattice spacings. By stabilizing power and polarization, we improve the power stability of the device by 56.53%, achieving lattice spacings ranging from 46.63 to 2.58 mu m and generating stable interference patterns consistent with theoretical predictions. The lattice's versatility and precision enable control of atomic interactions, supporting simulations of quantum phase transitions and many-body physics while advancing quantum simulations and information processing.

TI Provably superior accuracy in quantum stochastic modeling
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB In the design of stochastic models, there is a constant trade-off between model complexity and accuracy. Here we prove that quantum models enable a more favorable trade-off. We present a technique for identifying fundamental upper bounds on the predictive accuracy of dimensionality-constrained classical models. We identify quantum models that surpass this bound by creating an algorithm that learns quantum models given time-series data. We demonstrate that this quantum accuracy advantage is attainable in a present-day noisy quantum device. These results illustrate the immediate relevance of quantum technologies to time-series analysis and offer an instance where their resulting accuracy advantage can be provably established.

TI Optimal Scheme for Quantum Metrology
SO ADVANCED QUANTUM TECHNOLOGIES
AB Quantum metrology can achieve far better precision than classical metrology, and is one of the most important applications of quantum technologies in the real world. To attain the highest precision promised by quantum metrology, all steps of the schemes need to be optimized, which include the state preparation, parametrization, and measurement. Here the recent progresses on the optimization of these steps, which are essential for the identification and achievement of the ultimate precision limit in quantum metrology, are reviewed. It is hoped this provides a useful reference for the researchers in quantum metrology and related fields.

TI Breaking the limits of purification: postselection enhances heat-bath
   algorithmic cooling
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICS COMMUNICATIONS
AB Quantum technologies require pure states, which are often generated by extreme refrigeration. Heat-bath algorithmic cooling is the theoretically optimal refrigeration technique: it shuttles entropy from a multiparticle system to a thermal bath, thereby generating a quantum state with a high degree of purity. Here, we show how to surpass this hitherto-optimal technique by taking advantage of a single binary-outcome measurement. Our protocols can create arbitrary numbers of pure quantum states without any residual mixedness by using a recently discovered device known as a quantum switch to put two operations in superposition, with postselection certifying the complete purification.

TI Low disorder and high valley splitting in silicon
SO NPJ QUANTUM INFORMATION
AB The electrical characterisation of classical and quantum devices is a critical step in the development cycle of heterogeneous material stacks for semiconductor spin qubits. In the case of silicon, properties such as disorder and energy separation of conduction band valleys are commonly investigated individually upon modifications in selected parameters of the material stack. However, this reductionist approach fails to consider the interdependence between different structural and electronic properties at the danger of optimising one metric at the expense of the others. Here, we achieve a significant improvement in both disorder and valley splitting by taking a co-design approach to the material stack. We demonstrate isotopically purified, strained quantum wells with high mobility of 3.14(8) x 105 cm2 V-1 s-1 and low percolation density of 6.9(1) x 1010 cm-2. These low disorder quantum wells support quantum dots with low charge noise of 0.9(3) mu eV Hz-1/2 and large mean valley splitting energy of 0.24(7) meV, measured in qubit devices. By striking the delicate balance between disorder, charge noise, and valley splitting, these findings provide a benchmark for silicon as a host semiconductor for quantum dot qubits. We foresee the application of these heterostructures in larger, high-performance quantum processors.

TI Scaling of energy and power in a large quantum battery-charger model
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB We investigate a multiqubit quantum battery-charger model, focusing on its potential emulation on a super-conducting qubit chip. Using a large-spin representation, we first obtain the analytical form of the energy E-B(t) and power P-B(t), and their maximum values E-B(max) and P-B(max) , of the battery part by means of the antiferromagnetic Holstein-Primakoff transformation within the low-energy approximation. In this case, our results show that superextensive scaling behavior of P-B(max) ensues. By further combining these with the ones obtained via exact diagonalization, we classify the dynamics of various physical quantities, including the entanglement between the battery and charger parts for system sizes encompassing over 10 000 qubits. Finally, by checking a diverse set of system configurations, including either a fixed battery size with a growing number of charger qubits or when both parts simultaneously grow, we classify the system size scalings of E-B(max) and P-B(max) , relating it with the entanglement entropy in the system. In agreement with the analytical results, robust superextensive behavior ofP(B)(max) is also observed in this case. Our work provides an overall guide for expected features in experiments of quantum batteries emulated in superconducting qubit platforms, in particular ones that exhibit long-range couplings.

TI Device-independent Shannon entropy certification
SO NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB Quantum technologies promise information processing and communication technology advancements, including random number generation (RNG). Using Bell inequalities, a user of a quantum RNG hardware can certify that the values provided by an untrusted device are truly random. This problem has been extensively studied for von Neumann and min-entropy as a measure of randomness. However, in this paper, we analyze the feasibility of such verification for Shannon entropy. We investigate how the usability of various Bell inequalities differs depending on the presence of noise. Moreover, we present the benefit of certification for Shannon compared to min-entropy, as well as the tight analytical lower bound for Shannon entropy in randomness certification.

AB In waveguide quantum electrodynamics (QED) systems, atomic radiation emission is shaped by photonic environment and collective atom interactions, offering promising applications in quantum technologies. In particular, atom-photon bound states, inhibiting a complete spontaneous decay of the atom, can be realized through waveguide dispersion engineering or by utilizing giant atoms. While steady-state bound states are well understood, transient or virtual bound states remain less explored. Here, we investigate transient atom-photon bound states, arising from initial atom-photon entanglement, and propose methods to slow down spontaneous atomic decay. (c) 2025 Optica Publishing Group.

TI ac Josephson effect in a gate-tunable Cd3As2
   nanowire superconducting weak link
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
AB Three-dimensional topological Dirac semimetals have recently attracted significant attention since they possess exotic quantum states. When Josephson junctions are constructed utilizing these materials as the weak link, the fractional ac Josephson effect emerges in the presence of a topological supercurrent contribution. We investigate the ac Josephson effect in a Dirac semimetal Cd3As2 nanowire using two complementary methods: by probing the radiation spectrum and by measuring Shapiro patterns. With both techniques, we find that the conventional supercurrent dominates at all investigated doping levels and that any potentially present topological contribution falls below our detection threshold. The inclusion of thermal noise in a resistively and capacitively shunted junction (RCSJ) model allows us to reproduce the microwave characteristics of the junction. With this refinement, we explain how weak superconducting features can be masked and provide a framework to account for elevated electronic temperatures present in realistic experimental scenarios.

TI Quantum processor-inspired machine learning in the biomedical sciences
SO PATTERNS
AB Recent advances in high-throughput genomic technologies coupled with exponential increases in computer processing and memory have allowed us to interrogate the complex molecular underpinnings of human disease from a genome-wide perspective. While the deluge of genomic information is expected to increase, a bottleneck in conventional high-performance computing is rapidly approaching. Inspired by recent advances in physical quantum processors, we evaluated several unconventional machine-learning (ML) strategies on actual human tumor data, namely "Ising-type'' methods, whose objective function is formulated identical to simulated annealing and quantum annealing. We show the efficacy of multiple Ising-type ML algorithms for classification of multi-omics human cancer data from The Cancer Genome Atlas, comparing these classifiers to a variety of standard MLmethods. Our results indicate that Ising-typeML offers superior classification performance with smaller training datasets, thus providing compelling empirical evidence for the potential future application of unconventional computing approaches in the biomedical sciences.

TI Continuous entanglement distribution from an AlGaAs-on-insulator
   microcomb for quantum communications
SO OPTICA QUANTUM
AB Using an aluminum gallium arsenide microring resonator, we demonstrate a bright quantum optical microcomb with >300 nm (>40 THz) bandwidth and more than 20 sets of time-energy entangled modes, enabling spectral demultiplexing with simple, off-the-shelf commercial telecom components. We report high-rate continuous entanglement distribution for two sets of entangled-photon pair frequency modes exhibiting up to 20 GHz/mW(2) pair generation rate. As an illustrative example of entanglement distribution, we perform a continuous-wave time-bin quantum key distribution protocol with 8 kbps sifted key rates while maintaining less than 10% error rate and sufficient two-photon visibility to ensure security of the channel. When the >20 frequency modes are multiplexed, we estimate >100 kbps entanglement-based key rates or the creation of a multi-user quantum communications network. The entire system requires less than 110 mu W of on-chip optical power, demonstrating an efficient source of entangled frequency modes for quantum communications. As a proof of principle, a quantum key is distributed across 12 km of deployed fiber on the University of California Santa Barbara (UCSB) campus and used to encrypt a 21 kB image with <9% error.

In this article, the QCRB is systematically tighten using a hybrid classical-quantum framework by incorporating generalized unbiasedness constraints through test observables. These frequentist bounds form a hierarchy converging asymptotically to the QCRB as more measurements are performed. These hierarchical frequentist bounds are validated for single-qubit phase estimation on a photonic platform.

TI Role of non-Gaussian quantum fluctuations in neutrino entanglement
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW D
AB The flavor evolution of neutrinos in environments with large neutrino number densities is an open problem at the nexus of astrophysics and neutrino flavor physics. Among the many unanswered questions pertaining to this problem, it remains to be determined whether neutrino-neutrino coherent scattering can give rise to nontrivial quantum entanglement among neutrinos, and whether this can affect the flavor evolution in a meaningful way. To gain further insight into this question, here we study a simple system of two interacting neutrino beams and obtain the exact phase space explored by this system using the Husimi quasiprobability distribution. We observe that the entanglement induced by the coupling leads to strong delocalization in phase-space with largely non-Gaussian quantum fluctuations. The link between the neutrino entanglement and quantum fluctuations is illustrated using the one-and two-neutrino entropy. In addition, we propose an approximate phase-space method to describe the interacting neutrinos problem, where the exact evolution is replaced by a set of independent mean-field evolutions with a statistical sampling of the initial conditions. The phase-space approach provides a simple and accurate method to describe the gross features of the neutrino entanglement problem. Applications are shown using time -independent and time-dependent Hamiltonians in the nonadiabatic regime.

AB Motivated by a series of recent works, an interest in multifractal phases has risen as they are believed to be present in the Many-Body Localized (MBL) phase and are of high demand in quantum annealing and machine learning. Inspired by the success of the Rosenzweig-Porter (RP) model with Gaussian-distributed hopping elements, several RP -like ensembles with the fat-tailed distributed hopping terms have been proposed, with claims that they host the desired multifractal phase. In the present work, we develop a general (graphical) approach allowing a self-consistent analytical calculation of frac-tal dimensions for a generic RP model and investigate what features of the RP Hamil-tonians can be responsible for the multifractal phase emergence. We conclude that the only feature contributing to a genuine multifractality is the on-site energies' distribution, meaning that no random matrix model with a statistically homogeneous distribution of diagonal disorder and uncorrelated off-diagonal terms can host a multifractal phase.

TI Free-Space Quantum Secure Direct Communication: Basics, Progress, and
   Outlook
SO ADVANCED DEVICES & INSTRUMENTATION
AB Quantum secure direct communication (QSDC) leverages quantum states to transmit information securely and reliably over a noisy, lossy, and wiretapped quantum channel. It has been proven to be information-theoretically secure. Recent experiments show that QSDC can enable long-distance communication and large-scale networking with existing technologies. In particular, free-space QSDC has the unique advantages and prospects for practical large-scale application. Here, we review the QSDC basics and the progress of free-space QSDC. The feasibility of satellite-based QSDC and the future directions of free-space QSDC are discussed. We propose a practical and feasible route that can make immediate application of QSDC in real life.

TI Ising Machine Approach to the Lecturer-Student Assignment Problem
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB Ising machines are efficient solvers for combinatorial optimization problems (COPs). After mapping COPs to Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) problems, Ising machines search for the lowest energy solution of the QUBO corresponding to the optimal solution of the COP. Herein we propose an efficient method to formulate a lecturer-student assignment problem as a QUBO problem. In this problem, the sets of subjects, lecturers, students, lecturers' teachable subjects, and students' required subjects are given. To minimize lecture costs, the number of lecturers in charge of students must be minimized. The number of combinations drastically increases as the number of lecturers or students increases. Using these results, we theoretically prove the optimality, i.e., the formulated QUBO takes the lowest energy if and only if the students are optimally assigned to the lecturers. Additionally, we demonstrate that an Ising machine outperforms simulated annealing in terms of solution quality and execution time.

TI Trajectory phase transitions in non-interacting systems: all-to-all
   dynamics and the random energy model
SO PHILOSOPHICAL TRANSACTIONS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY A-MATHEMATICAL PHYSICAL
   AND ENGINEERING SCIENCES
AB We study the fluctuations of time-additive random observables in the stochastic dynamics of a system of N non-interacting Ising spins. We mainly consider the case of all-to-all dynamics where transitions are possible between any two spin configurations with uniform rates. We show that the cumulant generating function of the time-integral of a normally distributed quenched random function of configurations, i.e. the energy function of the random energy model (REM), has a phase transition in the large N limit for trajectories of any time extent. We prove this by determining the exact limit of the scaled cumulant generating function. This is accomplished by connecting the dynamical problem to a spectral analysis of the all-to-all quantum REM. We also discuss finite N corrections as observed in numerical simulations. This article is part of the theme issue 'Quantum annealing and computation: challenges and perspectives'.

TI Multiparty Quantum Private Comparison Protocol Using n-Particle
   GHZ State
SO MATHEMATICS
AB Multiparty quantum private comparison (MQPC) aims to determine the equality relationship of inputs from multiple participants while maintaining the confidentiality of these inputs. Current MQPC protocols primarily focus on utilizing d-level quantum states, which limits feasible implementation. To address this issue, we introduce an MQPC protocol that utilizes n-particle Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) state to enable private comparison while preserving the secrecy of individual inputs. A semi-honest third party (TP), adhering to protocol specifications but potentially curious about private data, generates and distributes GHZ state qubits to all participants. Each party encodes their secret input through rotation operations on their allocated qubits and returns the modified state to the TP, which then performs single-particle quantum measurements to derive the outcomes without accessing the raw inputs. The protocol's sequence distribution method yields a high qubit efficiency of 1/n, outperforming many existing MQPC protocols. Security analysis confirms resilience against external adversaries employing quantum attack strategies and collusion attempts among participants. Simulations using IBM Qiskit validate the feasibility of the protocol, which relies on GHZ state preparation, single-qubit operations, and single-particle quantum measurements.

TI Fast charging of an Ising-spin-pair quantum battery using optimal
   control
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB We consider the problem of maximizing the stored energy for a given charging duration in a quantum battery composed of a pair of spins-1/2 with Ising coupling starting from the spin-down state, using bounded transverse field control. We map this problem to an optimal control problem on a single qubit and by using optimal control theory we show that, although a single bang pulse can quickly achieve considerable charging levels for relatively large upper control bounds, higher levels of stored energy including complete charging are accomplished by a bang-singular-bang pulse sequence, where the intermediate singular pulse is an off pulse. If the control is restricted between zero and a maximum value, the initial and final bang pulses attain the maximum bound but have different durations, while if it is restricted between symmetric negative and positive boundaries, the bang pulses have the same duration but opposite boundary values. For both cases we provide transcendental equations from which the durations of the individual pulses in the optimal pulse-sequence can be calculated. For the case of full charging we surprisingly find that the three "switching" functions for the equivalent qubit problem become zero while the adjoint ket does not, consistent with optimal control theory.

TI Gate reflectometry in dense quantum dot arrays
SO NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB Silicon quantum devices are maturing from academic single- and two-qubit devices to industrially-fabricated dense quantum-dot (QD) arrays, increasing operational complexity and the need for better pulsed-gate and readout techniques. We perform gate-voltage pulsing and gate-based reflectometry measurements on a dense 2 x 2 array of silicon QDs fabricated in a 300 mm-wafer foundry. Utilizing the strong capacitive couplings within the array, it is sufficient to monitor only one gate electrode via high-frequency reflectometry to establish single-electron occupation in each of the four dots and to detect single-electron movements with high bandwidth. A global top-gate electrode adjusts the overall tunneling times, while linear combinations of side-gate voltages yield detailed charge stability diagrams. To test for spin physics and Pauli spin blockade at finite magnetic fields, we implement symmetric gate-voltage pulses that directly reveal bidirectional interdot charge relaxation as a function of the detuning between two dots. Charge sensing within the array can be established without the involvement of adjacent electron reservoirs, important for scaling such split-gate devices towards longer 2 x N arrays. Our techniques may find use in the scaling of few-dot spin-qubit devices to large-scale quantum processors.

TI Plug-and-play QKD architecture with a self-optical pulse train generator
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB The commercialization of quantum key distribution (QKD), which enables secure communication even in the era of quantum computers, has acquired significant interest. In particular, plug-and-play (PnP) QKD has garnered considerable attention owing to its advantage in system stabilization. However, a PnP QKD system has limitations on miniaturization owing to a bulky storage line (SL) of tens of kilometers. And, the secure key rate is relatively low because Bob transmits the signal pulses only at the dedicated time slots to circumvent backscattering noise. This study proposes a new method that can eliminate the SL by realizing an optical pulse train generator based on an optical cavity structure. Our method allows Alice to generate optical pulse trains herself by duplicating Bob's seed pulse and excludes the need for Bob's strong signal pulses that trigger backscattering noise as much as the conventional PnP QKD. Accordingly, our method can naturally overcome the miniaturization limitation and the slow secure key rate, as the storage line is no longer necessary. We conducted a proof-of-concept experiment using our method and achieved a key generation rate of 1.6x10(-3) count/pulse and quantum bit error rate <= 5%.

TI Low-Rate Denial-of-Service Attack Detection: Defense Strategy Based on
   Spectral Estimation for CV-QKD
SO PHOTONICS
AB Although continuous-variable quantum key distribution (CVQKD) systems have unconditional security in theory, there are still many cyber attacking strategies proposed that exploit the loopholes of hardware devices and algorithms. At present, few studies have focused on attacks using algorithm vulnerabilities. The low-rate denial-of-service (LDoS) attack is precisely an algorithm-loophole based hacking strategy, which attacks by manipulating a channel's transmittance T. In this paper, we take advantage of the feature that the power spectral density (PSD) of LDoS attacks in low frequency band is higher than normal traffic's to detect whether there are LDoS attacks. We put forward a detection method based on the Bartlett spectral estimation approach and discuss its feasibility from two aspects, the estimation consistency and the detection accuracy. Our experiment results demonstrate that the method can effectively detect LDoS attacks and maintain the consistency of estimation. In addition, compared with the traditional method based on the wavelet transform and Hurst index estimations, our method has higher detection accuracy and stronger pertinence. We anticipate our method may provide an insight into how to detect an LDoS attack in a CVQKD system.

TI Sensitivity of atom based on slow light propagation and rotary photon
   drag: an efficient and secure model for quantum-based sensors in
   Internet of Things
SO OPTICAL AND QUANTUM ELECTRONICS
AB Quantum technology has the potential to revolutionize sensors and the Internet of Things (IoT). Efficient and secure data transfer among sensors and IoT devices is a major challenge. To address this, the manuscript presents coherent manipulation of the scattering cross section and its sensitivity based on subluminal propagation and rotary photon drag, using an atomic medium with two levels coupled with a cavity. The group index of the proposed atomic medium is measured in the range of -0.1 = n(g) <= 150 and group velocity in the range of 2 x 10(6) m/s <= vg <= +/- 2 x 10(9) m/s. The maximum delay time is reported to t(g) = 0.3 mu s and rotary photon drag to theta(d) = +/- 5 micro radian. This effect of photon drag is used in sensing, energy harvesting, and optical switching in IoT. The scattering cross-section of 0.1 x 10(21) m(2) is reported. The scattering cross-section impacts the efficiency and reliability of quantum-based communication for IoT. The maximum cross-sectional sensitivity is measured to S-sigma = 0.4 x 10(-19) m(2)/n(r). The cross-sectional sensitivity potentially impacts secure communication and highly precise detection in sensors and IoT.

TI Quantum capacity of a deformed bosonic dephasing channel
SO OPTICAL SWITCHING AND NETWORKING
AB In this paper, using the notion of nonlinear coherent states, we define a deformed bosonic dephasing channel modeling the impact of a Kerr medium on a quantum state, as it occurs, for instance, in quantum communication based on optical fibers. We show that, in certain regimes, the Kerr nonlinearity is able to compensate the dephasing. In addition, our studies reveal that the quantum capacity of the deformed bosonic dephasing channel can be greater than that of the undeformed, standard bosonic dephasing channel for certain nonlinearity parameters.

TI Explainable natural language processing with matrix product states
SO NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB Despite empirical successes of recurrent neural networks (RNNs) in natural language processing (NLP), theoretical understanding of RNNs is still limited due to intrinsically complex non-linear computations. We systematically analyze RNNs' behaviors in a ubiquitous NLP task, the sentiment analysis of movie reviews, via the mapping between a class of RNNs called recurrent arithmetic circuits (RACs) and a matrix product state. Using the von-Neumann entanglement entropy (EE) as a proxy for information propagation, we show that single-layer RACs possess a maximum information propagation capacity, reflected by the saturation of the EE. Enlarging the bond dimension beyond the EE saturation threshold does not increase model prediction accuracies, so a minimal model that best estimates the data statistics can be inferred. Although the saturated EE is smaller than the maximum EE allowed by the area law, our minimal model still achieves similar to 99% training accuracies in realistic sentiment analysis data sets. Thus, low EE is not a warrant against the adoption of single-layer RACs for NLP. Contrary to a common belief that long-range information propagation is the main source of RNNs' successes, we show that single-layer RACs harness high expressiveness from the subtle interplay between the information propagation and the word vector embeddings. Our work sheds light on the phenomenology of learning in RACs, and more generally on the explainability of RNNs for NLP, using tools from many-body quantum physics.

TI Dynamics of quantum Fisher and Wigner-Yanase skew information following
   a noisy quench
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
AB We study the effect of noise on the dynamics of the transverse-field Ising model quenched across a quantum critical point. To quantify two-spin correlations, we employ the quantum Fisher information (QFI) and the Wigner-Yanase skew information (WYSI) as measures of quantum coherence. In the noiseless case, in contrast to the dynamics of entanglement in anisotropic XY chains, both QFI and WYSI increase monotonically with the ramp quench time, approaching their adiabatic limits without exhibiting any Kibble-Zurek-type scaling with quench duration. In contrast, when noise is added to the quench protocol, the coherence dynamics change qualitatively: QFI and WYSI both decay exponentially with the timescale of a ramp quench, with an exponent determined by the noise intensity. Furthermore, the maximum ramp time, at which either of these measures reaches its maximum, scales linearly with the noise variance, featuring the same exponent that determines the optimal annealing time for minimizing defect production in noisy quantum annealing.

TI Conditioned quantum-assisted deep generative surrogate for
   particle-binary vector indicating thecalorimeter interactions
SO NPJ QUANTUM INFORMATION
AB Particle collisions at accelerators like the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), recorded by experiments such as ATLAS and CMS, enable precise standard model measurements and searches for new phenomena. Simulating these collisions significantly influences experiment design and analysis but incurs immense computational costs, projected at millions of CPU-years annually during the high luminosity LHC (HL-LHC) phase. Currently, simulating a single event with Geant4 consumes around 1000 CPU seconds, with calorimeter simulations especially demanding. To address this, we propose a conditioned quantum-assisted generative model, integrating a conditioned variational autoencoder (VAE) and a conditioned restricted Boltzmann machine (RBM). Our RBM architecture is tailored for D-Wave's Pegasus-structured advantage quantum annealer for sampling, leveraging the flux bias for conditioning. This approach combines classical RBMs as universal approximators for discrete distributions with quantum annealing's speed and scalability. We also introduce an adaptive method for efficiently estimating effective inverse temperature, and validate our framework on Dataset 2 of CaloChallenge.

AB We consider the one-shot coding of multiple access channels one-time pad. Suppose that the senders and the receiver share an entangled state in the multi-party systems. Using the position-based coding, each sender encodes the classical messages on their systems, then they transmit their systems over the ideal quantum channels. The receiver applies a decoding operator to all the systems in order to figure out which message was transmitted with respect to the quantum joint typicality lemma. We provide the upper bound of the information leakage by the convex split lemma. Combining quantum max-information with quantum hypothesis testing mutual information, we give the inner bound of the achievable rate.

AB We study the effect of shared non-signaling correlations for the problem of simulating a channel using noiseless communication in the one-shot setting. For classical channels, we show how to round any non-signaling-assisted simulation strategy- which exactly corresponds to the meta-converse for channel simulation- to a strategy that only uses shared randomness. For quantum channels, we round any non-signalingassisted simulation strategy to a strategy that only uses shared entanglement. As our main result, we prove a guarantee on the ratio of success probabilities of at least (1 - 1/e), for both the classical and the quantum setting. We further show this ratio to be optimal. It can be improved to (1 - 1/t) using O(ln ln(t)) additional bits (qubits) of communication.

TI Fast measurements and multiqubit gates in dual-species atomic arrays
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB We propose and analyze an approach for fast syndrome measurements in an array of rubidium and cesium atomic qubits. The scheme works by implementing an interspecies controlled-NOT (CNOTk) gate, entangling one cesium ancilla qubit with k >= 1 rubidium qubits which are then used for state measurement. Utilizing Rydberg states with different interspecies and intraspecies interaction strengths, the proposal provides a syndrome measurement fidelity of F > 0.9999 in less than 5 mu s of integration time.

TI Lossy compression of matrices by black box optimisation of mixed integer
   nonlinear programming
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB In edge computing, suppressing data size is a challenge for machine learning models that perform complex tasks such as autonomous driving, in which computational resources (speed, memory size and power) are limited. Efficient lossy compression of matrix data has been introduced by decomposing it into the product of an integer and real matrices. However, its optimisation is difficult as it requires simultaneous optimisation of an integer and real variables. In this paper, we improve this optimisation by utilising recently developed black-box optimisation (BBO) algorithms with an Ising solver for binary variables. In addition, the algorithm can be used to solve mixed-integer programming problems that are linear and non-linear in terms of real and integer variables, respectively. The differences between the choice of Ising solvers (simulated annealing, quantum annealing and simulated quenching) and the strategies of the BBO algorithms (BOCS, FMQA and their variations) are discussed for further development of the BBO techniques.

TI Benchmark of quantum-inspired heuristic solvers for quadratic
   unconstrained binary optimization
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB Recently, inspired by quantum annealing, many solvers specialized for unconstrained binary quadratic programming problems have been developed. For further improvement and application of these solvers, it is important to clarify the differences in their performance for various types of problems. In this study, the performance of four quadratic unconstrained binary optimization problem solvers, namely D-Wave Hybrid Solver Service (HSS), Toshiba Simulated Bifurcation Machine (SBM), Fujitsu Digital Annealer (DA), and simulated annealing on a personal computer, was benchmarked. The problems used for benchmarking were instances of real problems in MQLib, instances of the SAT-UNSAT phase transition point of random not-all-equal 3-SAT (NAE 3-SAT), and the Ising spin glass Sherrington-Kirkpatrick (SK) model. Concerning MQLib instances, the HSS performance ranked first; for NAE 3-SAT, DA performance ranked first; and regarding the SK model, SBM performance ranked first. These results may help understand the strengths and weaknesses of these solvers.

TI Optimizing the Architecture of a Quantum-Classical Hybrid Machine
   Learning Model for Forecasting Ozone Concentrations: Air Quality
   Management Tool for Houston, Texas
SO ATMOSPHERE
AB Keeping track of air quality is paramount to issue preemptive measures to mitigate adversarial effects on the population. This study introduces a new quantum-classical approach, combining a graph-based deep learning structure with a quantum neural network to predict ozone concentration up to 6 h ahead. The proposed architecture utilized historical data from Houston, Texas, a major urban area that frequently fails to comply with air quality regulations. Our results revealed that a smoother transition between the classical framework and its quantum counterpart enhances the model's results. Moreover, we observed that combining min-max normalization with increased ansatz repetitions also improved the hybrid model's performance. This was evident from evaluating the assessment metrics root mean square error (RMSE), coefficient of determination (R2) and forecast skill (FS). Values for R2 and FS for the horizons considered were 94.12% and 31.01% for the 1 h, 83.94% and 48.01% for the 3 h, and 75.62% and 57.46% for the 6 h forecasts. A comparison with the existing literature for both classical and QML models revealed that the proposed methodology could provide competitive results, and even surpass some well-established forecasting models, proving to be a valuable resource for air quality forecasting, and thus validating this approach.

TI Raman sideband cooling in optical tweezer arrays for Rydberg dressing
SO SCIPOST PHYSICS
AB Single neutral atoms trapped in optical tweezers and laser-coupled to Rydberg states provide a fast and flexible platform to generate configurable atomic arrays for quantum simulation. The platform is especially suited to study quantum spin systems in various geometries. However, for experiments requiring continuous trapping, inhomogeneous light shifts induced by the trapping potential and temperature broadening impose severe limitations. Here we show how Raman sideband cooling allows one to overcome those limitations, thus, preparing the stage for Rydberg dressing in tweezer arrays.

TI Bang-bang preparation of quantum many-body ground states in two
   dimensions: Optimization of the algorithm with a two-dimensional tensor
   network
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
AB A bang-bang (BB) algorithm prepares the ground state of a two-dimensional (2D) quantum many-body Hamiltonian H = H1+ H2 by evolving an initial product state alternating between H1 and H2. We use the neighborhood tensor update to simulate the BB evolution with an infinite pair-entangled projected state (iPEPS). The alternating sequence is optimized with the final energy as a cost function. The energy is calculated with a tangent space power method for the sake of its stability. The method is benchmarked in the 2D transverse field quantum Ising model near its quantum critical point against a ground state obtained with variational optimization of the iPEPS. The optimal BB sequence differs nonperturbatively from a sequence simulating quantum annealing or adiabatic preparation (AP) of the ground state. The optimal BB energy converges with the number of bangs much faster than the optimal AP energy.

TI Machine learning based energy-free structure predictions of molecules,
   transition states, and solids
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Accurate computational prediction of atomistic structure with traditional methods is challenging. The authors report a kernel-based machine learning model capable of reconstructing 3D atomic coordinates from predicted interatomic distances across a variety of system classes.
   The computational prediction of atomistic structure is a long-standing problem in physics, chemistry, materials, and biology. Conventionally, force-fields or ab initio methods determine structure through energy minimization, which is either approximate or computationally demanding. This accuracy/cost trade-off prohibits the generation of synthetic big data sets accounting for chemical space with atomistic detail. Exploiting implicit correlations among relaxed structures in training data sets, our machine learning model Graph-To-Structure (G2S) generalizes across compound space in order to infer interatomic distances for out-of-sample compounds, effectively enabling the direct reconstruction of coordinates, and thereby bypassing the conventional energy optimization task. The numerical evidence collected includes 3D coordinate predictions for organic molecules, transition states, and crystalline solids. G2S improves systematically with training set size, reaching mean absolute interatomic distance prediction errors of less than 0.2 A for less than eight thousand training structures - on par or better than conventional structure generators. Applicability tests of G2S include successful predictions for systems which typically require manual intervention, improved initial guesses for subsequent conventional ab initio based relaxation, and input generation for subsequent use of structure based quantum machine learning models.

TI Tripartite Wigner's friend scenario and its test
SO PHYSICA SCRIPTA
AB Wigner's friend thought experiment is intended to reveal the inherent tension between unitary evolution and measurement collapse. Inspired by the Wigner's friend experiment, Brukner derives a no-go theorem for observer-independent facts, focusing on two entangled observers in their respective laboratories. We construct an extended Wigner's friend scenario, including three laboratories, namely, Alice's laboratory, Bob's laboratory and Charlie's laboratory, where Alice, Bob and Charlie are standing outside the laboratories while their friends are placed inside their own laboratories. To realize this scenario, we create a universal quantum circuit, especially the circuit realization of the state evolution and measurement inside each laboratory, simple but novel. We carry out experiments on the IBM quantum computers to test the primary circuits, i.e. state preparation, state evolution and measurement inside each laboratory. Furthermore, we perform the simulation of the quantum circuit via Q# quantum programming on a classical computer.

TI Matrix of orthogonalized atomic orbital coefficients representation for
   radicals and ions
SO JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL PHYSICS
AB Chemical (molecular, quantum) machine learning relies on representing molecules in unique and informative ways. Here, we present the matrix of orthogonalized atomic orbital coefficients (MAOC) as a quantum-inspired molecular and atomic representation containing both structural (composition and geometry) and electronic (charge and spin multiplicity) information. MAOC is based on a cost-effective localization scheme that represents localized orbitals via a predefined set of atomic orbitals. The latter can be constructed from such small atom-centered basis sets as pcseg-0 and STO-3G in conjunction with guess (non-optimized) electronic configuration of the molecule. Importantly, MAOC is suitable for representing monatomic, molecular, and periodic systems and can distinguish compounds with identical compositions and geometries but distinct charges and spin multiplicities. Using principal component analysis, we constructed a more compact but equally powerful version of MAOC-PCX-MAOC. To test the performance of full and reduced MAOC and several other representations (CM, SOAP, SLATM, and SPA(H)M), we used a kernel ridge regression machine learning model to predict frontier molecular orbital energy levels and ground state single-point energies for chemically diverse neutral and charged, closed- and open-shell molecules from an extended QM7b dataset, as well as two new datasets, N-HPC-1 (N-heteropolycycles) and REDOX (nitroxyl and phenoxyl radicals, carbonyl, and cyano compounds). MAOC affords accuracy that is either similar or superior to other representations for a range of chemical properties and systems.

TI Guided quantum walk
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB We utilize the theory of local amplitude transfer (LAT) to gain insights into quantum walks (QWs) and quantum annealing (QA) beyond the adiabatic theorem. By representing the eigenspace of the problem Hamiltonian as a hypercube graph, we demonstrate that probability amplitude traverses the search space through a series of local Rabi oscillations. We argue that the amplitude movement can be systematically guided towards the ground state using a time-dependent hopping rate based solely on the problem's energy spectrum. Building upon these insights, we extend the concept of multistage QW by introducing the guided quantum walk (GQW) as a bridge between QW-like and QA-like procedures. We assess the performance of the GQW on exact cover, traveling salesperson, and garden optimization problems with 9 to 30 qubits. Our results provide evidence for the existence of optimal annealing schedules, beyond the requirement of adiabatic time evolutions. These schedules might be capable of solving large-scale combinatorial optimization problems within evolution times that scale linearly in the problem size.

Using a device architecture of interdigitated gate fingers, we can control the interdot tunnel coupling between 1 and 4GHz and the mutual capacitive coupling between 0.2 and 0.6meV, independent of the charge occupation of the quantum dots. The charging energy and, hence, the dot size remain nearly unchanged. The tuning range of the tunnel coupling covers the operating regime of typical silicon and GaAs spin qubit devices.

SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICS COMMUNICATIONS
AB We compute the n-shot classical capacity of the quantum erasure channel, providing upper bounds and almost-matching lower bounds for it, the latter achievable via large-minimum-distance classical linear codes for any n. The protocols are in full product form, i.e. no entanglement is needed either at the encoder or decoder to attain the capacity, and they explicitly adapt to the transition between different error regimes as the erasure probability increases. Finally, we show that our upper and lower bounds on the capacity are tighter than those obtainable from the general theory of finite-size capacity via generalized divergences.

TI Factoring semi-primes with (quantum) SAT-solvers
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB The computational difficulty of factoring large integers forms the basis of security for RSA public-key cryptography. The best-known factoring algorithms for classical computers run in sub-exponential time. The integer factorization problem can be reduced to the Boolean Satisfiability problem (SAT). While this reduction has proved to be useful for studying SAT solvers, large integers have not been factored via such a reduction. Shor's quantum factoring algorithm factors integers in expected polynomial time. Large-scale fault-tolerant quantum computers capable of implementing Shor's algorithm are not yet available, preventing relevant benchmarking experiments. Recently, several authors have attempted quantum factorizations via reductions to SAT or similar NP-hard problems. While this approach may shed light on algorithmic approaches for quantum solutions to NP-hard problems, in this paper we study and question its practicality. We find no evidence that this is a viable path toward factoring large numbers, even for scalable fault-tolerant quantum computers, as well as for various quantum annealing or other special purpose quantum hardware.

AB Ferroelectric materials manifest unique dielectric, ferroelastic, and piezoelectric properties. A targeted design of ferroelectrics at the nanoscale is not only of fundamental appeal but holds the highest potential for applications. Compared to two-dimensional nanostructures such as thin films and superlattices, one-dimensional ferroelectric nanowires are investigated to a much lesser extent. Here, we reveal a variety of the topological polarization states, particularly the vortex and helical chiral phases, in loaded ferroelectric nanowires, which enable us to complete the strain-temperature phase diagram of the one-dimensional ferroelectrics. These phases are of prime importance for optoelectronics and quantum communication technologies.

TI Spatially Tunable Spin Interactions in Neutral Atom Arrays
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB Analog quantum simulations with Rydberg atoms in optical tweezers routinely address strongly correlated many-body problems due to the hardware-efficient implementation of the Hamiltonian. Yet, their generality is limited, and flexible Hamiltonian-design techniques are needed to widen the scope of these simulators. Here we report on the realization of spatially tunable interactions for XYZ models implemented by two-color near-resonant coupling to Rydberg pair states. Our results demonstrate the unique opportunities of Rydberg dressing for Hamiltonian design in analog quantum simulators.

TI Descriptors of dimensionality for n x n density matrices
SO EUROPEAN PHYSICAL JOURNAL PLUS
AB By using the recently introduced parametrization of an n-dimensional density matrix in terms of the indices of population asymmetry and the intrinsic coherences, we define descriptors in both integer and continuous forms of the effective dimension that take place for a complete description of a density matrix, thus providing accurate information beyond the rank of the density matrix. The concepts of dimensional folding, hidden dimensional purity, and dimensional entropy are introduced and discussed in view of the new approach presented. The results are applicable to any physical system represented by a density matrix, such as n-level quantum systems, qutrits, sets of interacting pencils of radiation, classical polarization states, and to transformations of density matrices, as occurs with quantum channels.

TI Capacity of non-Markovianity to boost the efficiency of molecular
   switches
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Quantum resource theory formulations of thermodynamics offer a versatile tool for the study of fundamental limitations to the efficiency of physical processes, independently of the microscopic details governing their dynamics. Despite the ubiquitous presence of non-Markovian dynamics in open quantum systems at the nanoscale, rigorous proofs of their beneficial effects on the efficiency of quantum dynamical processes at the molecular level have not been reported yet. Here we combine the quantum resource theory of athermality with concepts from the theory of divisibility classes of quantum channels to prove that memory effects can increase the efficiency of photoisomerization to levels that are not achievable under a purely thermal Markovian (i.e., memoryless) evolution. This provides rigorous evidence that memory effects can provide a resource in quantum thermodynamics at the nanoscale.

AB Quantum annealing is an emerging technology with the potential to solve some of the computational challenges that remain unresolved as we approach an era beyond Moore's Law. In this work, we investigate the capabilities of the quantum annealers of D-Wave Systems, Inc., for computing a certain type of Boolean tensor decomposition called Boolean Hierarchical Tucker Network (BHTN). Boolean tensor decomposition problems ask for finding a decomposition of a high-dimensional tensor with categorical, [true, false], values, as a product of smaller Boolean core tensors. As the BHTN decompositions are usually not exact, we aim to approximate an input high-dimensional tensor by a product of lower-dimensional tensors such that the difference between both is minimized in some norm. We show that BHTN can be calculated as a sequence of optimization problems suitable for the D-Wave 2000Q quantum annealer. Although current technology is still fairly restricted in the problems they can address, we show that a complex problem such as BHTN can be solved efficiently and accurately.

TI Measuring High-Order Phonon Correlations in an Optomechanical Resonator
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB We use single photon detectors to probe the motional state of a superfluid He-4 resonator of mass similar to 1 ng. The arrival times of Stokes and anti-Stokes photons (scattered by the resonator's acoustic mode) are used to measure the resonator's phonon coherences up to the fourth order. By postselecting on photon detection events, we also measure coherences in the resonator when <= 3 phonons have been added or subtracted. These measurements are found to be consistent with predictions that assume the acoustic mode to be in thermal equilibrium with a bath through a Markovian coupling.

AB We revisit the genuine multipartite entanglement by a simplified method, which only involves the Schmidt decomposition and local unitary transformation. We construct a local unitary equivalent class of the tri-qubit quantum state, then use the trace norm of the whole correlation tensor as a measurement to detect genuine multipartite entanglement. By detailed examples, we show our result can detect more genuinely entangled states. Furthermore, we generalize the genuine multipartite entanglement criterion to tripartite higher-dimensional systems.

TI Ising Machine Based on Bistable Microelectromechanical Systems
SO JOURNAL OF THE PHYSICAL SOCIETY OF JAPAN
AB We propose an Ising machine made of microelectromechanical systems (MEMS), where the annealing process is automatically executed by a dissipation mechanism. The core structure is a series of buckled plates. Two stable positions of each plate (left and right) represent its binary state acting as a bit so that a plate works as a mechanical memory. The electrostatic interaction between adjacent plates is introduced by applying voltage. Plates continue to flip between two stable buckled positions until the series of plates reaches a local minimum due to the damping of the mechanical motion. First, we design Ising machines simulating a ferromagnetic (FM) interaction and an antiferromagnetic (AF) interaction separately. Then, we propose a fully-connected MEMS network representing a coexistence system of FM and AF interactions in an arbitral way, by way of which an arbitrary combinatorial problem described by the Ising model can be solved. The present mechanism works at room temperature without external magnetic field, which is very different from the standard classical or quantum annealing mechanism.

AB This paper develops practical summation techniques in ZXW calculus to reason about quantum dynamics, such as unitary time evolution. First we give a direct representation of a wide class of sums of linear operators, including arbitrary qubits Hamiltonians, in ZXW calculus. As an application, we demonstrate the linearity of the Schrodinger equation and give a diagrammatic representation of the Hamiltonian in Greene-Diniz et al [13], which is the first paper that models carbon capture using quantum computing. We then use the Cayley-Hamilton theorem to show in principle how to exponentiate arbitrary qubits Hamiltonians in ZXW calculus. Finally, we develop practical techniques and show how to do Taylor expansion and Trotterization diagrammatically for Hamiltonian simulation. This sets up the framework for using ZXW calculus to the problems in quantum chemistry and condensed matter physics.

TI Design of Waveguide Polarization Convertor Based on Asymmetric 1D
   Photonic Crystals
SO NANOMATERIALS
AB Photonic crystals possess metastructures with a unique dispersion relation. An integrated optical circuit plays a crucial role in quantum computing, for which miniaturized optical components can be designed according to the characteristics of photonic crystals. Because the stable light transmission mode for a square waveguide is transverse electric or transverse magnetic polarization, we designed a half-waveplate element with a photonic crystal that can rotate the polarization direction of the light incident on a waveguide by 90 degrees. Using the dispersion relation of photonic crystals, the polarization rotation length and the optical axis's angle of deviation from the electric field in the eigenmode can be effectively calculated. Polarization rotators designed on the basis of photonic crystal structures can effectively reduce the insertion loss of components and exhibit favorable polarization rotation performance.

However, despite this exponential expansion, the ability to determine with any degree of certainty the reaction mechanisms of these types of reactions fails to keep within pace. Due to increasing calculation capacity and methods accuracy, computational methodologies have been established as an essential approach in both a predictive and supportive role to aid the synthetic design of novel catalysts by enabling the prediction of catalytic behaviour. This review is focused on the computationally-led catalyst design within asymmetric organocatalysis, discussing the different theoretical approaches most commonly utilised.

AB We present and discuss a non-expensive mechanical experiment which is very suitable for a classroom demonstration of the fold catastrophe behaviour. The apparatus consists of a bar attached to a pulley, to which a hanging body is connected by means of a thread wrapped around its rim. The system may perform stable oscillations or, else, the body may continuously fall down, while the pulley executes a sequence of 360 degrees rotations. This behaviour is analysed in connection with the shape of the potential, which is a good example of a fold catastrophe potential. For the system to perform stable oscillations, that shape reminds a clothes washboard, with local maxima and minima, a potential well known in superconducting quantum computing. We provide some hints for the instructor to explore the device in lab classes.

AB Substructural type systems, such as affine (and linear) type systems, are type systems which impose restrictions on copying (and discarding) of variables, and they have found many applications in computer science, including quantum programming. We describe one linear and one affine type systems and we formulate abstract categorical models for both of them which are sound and computationally adequate. We also show, under basic assumptions, that interpreting lambda abstractions via a monoidal closed structure (a popular method for linear type systems) necessarily leads to degenerate and inadequate models for call-by-value affine type systems with recursion. In our categorical treatment, a solution to this problem is clearly presented. Our categorical models are more general than linear/non-linear models used to study linear logic and we present a homogeneous categorical account of both linear and affine type systems in a call-by-value setting. We also give examples with many concrete models, including classical and quantum ones.

TI On hybrid quanvolutional neural networks optimization
SO QUANTUM MACHINE INTELLIGENCE
AB This paper investigates the optimization properties of hybrid quantum-classical quanvolutional neural networks (QuanvNNs), i.e., hybrid architectures merging quanvolutional layers with classical dense layers. We explore several optimization strategies by assessing 9 optimizers across various configurations of layers and kernel size. Through rigorous experimentation, it was found that optimizers such as Adabelief, RMSProp, and Adam outperform others, showcasing high accuracy scores. Conversely, Fromage, SM3, and Adagrad exhibit notably lower performance, highlighting the difficulty of effectively navigating the loss landscape. These findings emphasize the critical role of optimizer selection in a gradient-based variational optimization strategy. Additionally, quanvolutional layer parameters exhibit minimal fluctuations during the training phase, while classical parameters undergo variations on an order of magnitude higher. This disparity suggests a distinct behavior in the optimization dynamics between quantum and classical components, potentially influencing the efficacy of each layer type and offering valuable insights into the underlying mechanisms governing quanvolutional filters. We also evaluate QuanvNN robustness through comparisons against classical CNNs in scenarios involving few-shot learning and input perturbations. Our experimental findings underscore not only enhanced convergence capabilities of QuanvNNs, but also emphasize their superior efficacy in handling severely perturbed inputs. Finally, a randomized QuanvNN variant is tested, yielding comparable performance to optimized models as suggested by previous experiments on parameters variation. All these findings underscore the potential of QuanvNNs in offering robustness and optimization potential compared to their classical counterparts, with implications for quantum-enhanced machine learning.

AB There is a current healthcare need for improved prosthetic socket fit provision for the masses using low-cost and simple to manufacture sensors that can measure pressure, shear, and friction. There is also a need to address society's increasing concerns regarding the environmental impact of electronics and IoT devices. Prototype thin, low-cost, and low-weight pressure, shear, and loss of friction sensors have been developed and assembled for trans-femoral amputees. These flexible and conformable sensors are simple to manufacture and utilize more enviro-friendly novel magnetite-based QTSS (TM) (Quantum Technology Supersensor (TM)) quantum materials. They have undergone some initial tests on flat and curved surfaces in a pilot amputee trial, which are presented in this paper. These initial findings indicate that the prototype pressure sensor strip is capable of measuring pressure both on flat and curved socket surfaces in a pilot amputee trial. They have also demonstrated that the prototype shear sensor can indicate increasing shear forces, the resultant direction of the shear forces, and loss of friction/slippage events. Further testing, amputee trials, and ongoing optimization is continuing as part of the SocketSense project to assist prosthetic comfort and fit.

TI Neodymium laser-pumped ultra-low noise tunable Brillouin fiber laser
   around 920 nm
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB We have developed an ultra-low noise tunable Brillouin fiber laser exhibiting three orders of magnitude better frequency noise performance than the Neodymium-doped fiber laser pump and remarkable optical signal-to-noise ratio exceeding 80 dB suitable for immediate applications in coherent nonlinear conversion, quantum computing and underwater communications. In addition, we have implemented a custom optical phase-locked loop to ensure long-term stable operation and have investigated its impact on frequency noise. We demonstrate the power scalability of the single frequency (Hz-class) Brillouin laser, delivering over 500 mW with tunability across the 900 nm to 930 nm range in an all-fiber fully polarization-maintaining architecture.

TI Computational projects with the Landau-Zener problem in the quantum
   mechanics classroom
SO AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB The Landau-Zener problem, where a minimum energy separation is passed with constant rate in a two-state quantum-mechanical system, is an excellent model quantum system for a computational project. It requires a low-level computational effort, but has a number of complex numerical and algorithmic issues that can be resolved through dedicated work. It can be used to teach computational concepts, such as accuracy, discretization, and extrapolation, and it reinforces quantum concepts of time-evolution via a time-ordered product and of extrapolation to infinite time via time-dependent perturbation theory. In addition, we discuss the concept of compression algorithms, which are employed in many advanced quantum computing strategies, and easy to illustrate with the Landau-Zener problem.

TI Strain engineering of topological transitions in 2D materials: a
   multi-band approach
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB This study presents a comprehensive multi-band analytical and numerical framework to investigate strain-induced topological phase transitions and electronic structure changes in two-dimensional (2D) materials. We derive accurate formulas for strain-dependent band gaps and critical strain thresholds, elucidating the role of strain in band inversion, Berry curvature, and electronic properties in phosphorene and MoS2. These formulas reliably predict topological transitions (e.g., Z(2) index or Chern number) and nonlinear band gap reductions, validated by tight-binding simulations, first-principles calculations, and experimental data. The framework is demonstrated for phosphorene and MoS2, with potential extensions to other 2D materials and heterostructures, which may facilitate applications in quantum computing, spintronics, and optoelectronics through strain engineering.

TI Ultrafast all-electrical universal nanoqubits
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
AB We propose how to create, control, and read out real -space localized spin qubits in proximitized finite graphene nanoribbon (GNR) systems using purely electrical methods. Our proposed nanoqubits are formed of in -gap singlet -triplet states that emerge through the interplay of Coulomb and relativistic spin -dependent interactions in GNRs placed on a magnetic substrate. Application of an electric field perpendicular to the GNR heterostructure leads to a sudden change in the proximity couplings, i.e., a quantum quench, which enables us to deterministically rotate the nanoqubit to any arbitrary point on the Bloch sphere. We predict these spin qubits to undergo Rabi oscillations with optimal visibility and frequencies in excess of 10 GHz. Our findings open up an avenue for the realization of graphene-based quantum computing with ultrafast all -electrical methods.

TI Numerical simulation of probabilistic computing to NP-complete number
   theory problems
SO JOURNAL OF PHOTONICS FOR ENERGY
AB Probabilistic computing with p-bits is a powerful, unique paradigm alternative to classical computing and holds experimental advantages over certain forms of quantum computing. Stochastic nanodevices have been experimentally demonstrated to act as artificial neurons in solving certain problems through probabilistic computing. Still, many open questions about the breadth and size of soluble problems remain. We demonstrate the capability of probabilistic computing made of a stochastic nanodevice network in solving likely NP (non-deterministic polynomial time)-complete number theory problems associated with combinatorial optimization, which can be implemented using a network of optical parametric oscillators. These simulation results show robustness across all problems tested, with great potential to scale to solve substantially larger problems.

TI Quantum-Coherent Light-Electron Interaction in a Scanning Electron
   Microscope
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB The last two decades experimentally affirmed the quantum nature of free electron wave packets by the rapid development of transmission electron microscopes into ultrafast, quantum-coherent systems. So far, all experiments were restricted to the bounds of transmission electron microscopes enabling one or two photon-electron interaction sites. We show the quantum coherent coupling between electrons and light in a scanning electron microscope, at unprecedentedly low, subrelativistic energies down to 10.4 keV. These microscopes not only afford the yet-unexplored energies from ???0.5 to 30 keV providing the optimum electron-light coupling efficiency, but also offer spacious and easily configurable experimental chambers for extended, cascaded optical set ups, potentially boasting thousands of photon-electron interaction sites. Our results make possible experiments in electron wave packet shaping, quantum computing, and spectral imaging with low-energy electrons.

TI Classically efficient quantum scalable Fermi-Hubbard benchmark
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB In order to quantify the relative performance of different test-bed quantum computing devices, it is useful to benchmark them using a common protocol. While some benchmarks rely on the performance of random circuits and are generic in nature, here we instead propose and implement a practical, application-based benchmark. In particular, our protocol calculates the energy of the ground state in the single-particle subspace of a onedimensional (1D) Fermi Hubbard model, a problem which is efficient to solve classically. We provide a quantum ansatz for the problem that is provably able to probe the full single-particle subspace for a general-length 1D chain and scales efficiently in number of gates and measurements. Finally, we demonstrate and analyze the benchmark performance on superconducting and ion-trap test-bed hardware from three hardware vendors and with up to 24 qubits.

We describe the formalism and report on calculations for the s-wave superconductor Nb, a potential component of the materials platform enabling the realization of the Majorana zero modes in the field of topological quantum computing. We compare the properties of the superconducting state both in the bulk and for (110) surfaces. We compare slab calculations for different thicknesses, the effect of surface relaxations, and the influence of a softening of phonon modes on the surface for the resulting superconducting gap.

Our research spans from interconnect topology and geometry optimization, to wire length reduction via scalable placement, to use of novel interconnect technologies such as 3D IC and RF-interconnects, to recent work on interconnect pipelining in chiplet designs, and the shift from interconnect to entanglement in quantum computing. The latter two efforts go beyond the typical physical design space and involve space-time co-optimization. This paper is dedicated to multiple generations of Ph.D. students, post-docs, and visiting researchers who contributed to build a strong physical design research program at UCLA.

TI Multi-target quantum compilation algorithm
SO MACHINE LEARNING-SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB Quantum compilation is the process of converting a target unitary operation into a trainable unitary represented by a quantum circuit. It has a wide range of applications, including gate optimization, quantum-assisted compiling, quantum state preparation, and quantum dynamic simulation. Traditional quantum compilation usually optimizes circuits for a single target. However, many quantum systems require simultaneous optimization of multiple targets, such as thermal state preparation, time-dependent dynamic simulation, and others. To address this, we develop a multi-target quantum compilation algorithm to improve the performance and flexibility of simulating multiple quantum systems. Our benchmarks and case studies demonstrate the effectiveness of the algorithm, highlighting the importance of multi-target optimization in advancing quantum computing. This work lays the groundwork for further development and evaluation of multi-target quantum compilation algorithms.

TI Reduced Density Matrix Formulation of Quantum Linear Response
SO JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL THEORY AND COMPUTATION
AB The prediction of spectral properties via linear response (LR) theory is an important tool in quantum chemistry for understanding photoinduced processes in molecular systems. With the advances of quantum computing, we recently adapted this method for near-term quantum hardware using a truncated active space approximation with orbital rotation, named quantum linear response (qLR). In an effort to reduce the classic cost of this hybrid approach, we here derive and implement a reduced density matrix (RDM) driven approach of qLR. This allows for the calculation of spectral properties of moderately sized molecules with much larger basis sets than so far possible. We report qLR results for benzene and R-methyloxirane with a cc-pVTZ basis set and study the effect of shot noise on the valence and oxygen K-edge absorption spectra of H2O in the cc-pVTZ basis.

TI Gapless spinon excitations emerging from a multipolar transverse field
   in the triangular-lattice NaTmSe2
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
AB The triangular-lattice quantum Ising antiferromagnet is a promising platform for realizing Anderson's quantum spin liquid, though finding suitable materials to realize it remains a challenge. Here, we present a comprehensive study of NaTmSe2 using magnetization, specific heat, neutron scattering, and muon spin relaxation, combined with theoretical calculations. We demonstrate that NaTmSe2 realizes the transverse field Ising model and quantitatively determine its exchange parameters. Our results reveal a multipolar spin-polarized state coexisting with a dipolar spin-disordered state. These states feature gapless spinon excitations mediated by the multipolar moments. The study shows how multiple types of magnetism can emerge in distinct magnetic channels (dipolar and multipolar) within a single magnet, advancing our understanding of spin-frustrated Ising physics and opening pathways for different quantum computing applications.

TI Highly-Efficient Hardware Architecture for ML-KEM PQC Standard
SO IEEE OPEN JOURNAL OF CIRCUITS AND SYSTEMS
AB The advent of quantum computers, with their immense computational potential, poses significant threats to traditional cryptographic systems. In response, NIST announced the quantum-resistant Module Lattice-based Key Encapsulation Mechanism (ML-KEM) standard in 2024. This paper presents an efficient hardware architecture for the ML-KEM scheme, capable of supporting all algorithms and flexibly adapting to different security levels. The proposed design achieves a balance between high performance and low hardware resource consumption, making it suitable for deployment across various FPGA platforms. Key innovations include the Unified Polynomial Arithmetic Module (UniPAM), capable of handling all polynomial arithmetic operations, and an optimized hash module for the SHA-3 variants integral to ML-KEM. Additionally, the design introduces an efficient timing diagram and conflict-free memory management strategy, enabling seamless parallelism and reducing execution time while minimizing hardware resource consumption. Furthermore, the implementation incorporates several methods to effectively mitigate side-channel attacks, a common concern in hardware-based cryptosystem deployments. The proposed architecture is validated through implementation on an Artix-7 FPGA and Synopsys 14nm ASIC technology. Compared to state-of-the-art designs, our approach demonstrates superior performance while maintaining comparable hardware resource efficiency. Specifically, the hardware implementation on the Xilinx Artix-7 utilizes 12k LUTs, 6.9k FFs, 4 DSPs, and 9 BRAMs at clock frequency of 220 MHz.

TI Topological state and number transitions of optical skyrmions upon
   free-space beam propagation
SO COMMUNICATIONS PHYSICS
AB Skyrmions are typical topological structures of vectorial texture that have emerged in quantum fields, magnetic systems, liquid crystals, and other contexts, showing great potential for applications in spintronics, data storage, and quantum computing. As the optical counterparts of topologically protected quasiparticles, optical skyrmions have a specific type of topological stability that skyrmion number is invariant upon light propagation in free space. Here, we demonstrate the topological state and skyrmion number transitions of two-dimensional (2D) optical skyrmions upon beam propagation in free space. By simultaneously tailoring the longitudinal intensity profiles of vortex and non-vortex Bessel components with orthogonal polarizations, 2D optical skyrmion transitions with controllable topological states and skyrmion numbers are observed in quasi-nondiffractive skyrmionic beams. Manipulating the field topologies may hold significant potential in applications related to information processing and transmission.

TI Investigation of High Temperature Characteristics in UV-A GaN Laser
   Diodes
SO IEEE PHOTONICS JOURNAL
AB Laser diodes (LDs) are especially useful for applications which require high optical output intensity at precise wavelengths, such as spectroscopy and quantum computing. However, the high current densities needed to operate these LDs, especially at short emission wavelengths, leads to significant device self-heating which, in turn, leads to shifts in the lasing threshold current density and in emission wavelength, and a decrease in efficiency, all highly detrimental to stable operation. In this work, we use the characteristic temperature of lasing threshold, T-0, and the characteristic temperature of external differential quantum efficiency, T-1, to quantify these thermal effects on a UV-A GaN LD with a room temperature emission wavelength of 376 nm.

TI Measurement of the muon flux in the tunnels of Doss Trento hill
SO NUCLEAR INSTRUMENTS & METHODS IN PHYSICS RESEARCH SECTION A-ACCELERATORS
   SPECTROMETERS DETECTORS AND ASSOCIATED EQUIPMENT
AB In the context of astroparticle physics, nuclear astrophysics and quantum computing projects, it is important identifying underground laboratories where the cosmogenic background is suppressed. Located about 500 m far from the center of Trento (Italy) the Piedicastello tunnels are covered by 100 m limestone rock of the Doss Trento hill. The site exceeds 6000 m2 surface and is currently hosting events, temporary exhibitions, and educational activities. The cosmogenic background was measured in different locations within the Piedicastello tunnels with three portable scintillator telescopes having different geometrical acceptances. The muon flux measured in the deepest part was found to be about two orders of magnitude lower than the surface flux. This preliminary measurement suggests the use of the site as a facility in which a low environmental background is required.

TI Phase jumps in Josephson junctions with time-dependent spin-orbit
   coupling
SO APPLIED PHYSICS LETTERS
AB Planar Josephson junctions (JJs), based on common superconductors and III-V semiconductors, are sought for Majorana states and fault-tolerant quantum computing. However, with gate-tunable spin-orbit coupling (SOC), we show that the range of potential applications of such JJs becomes much broader. The time-dependent SOC offers unexplored mechanisms for switching JJs, accompanied by the 2 pi-phase jumps and the voltage pulses corresponding to the single-flux-quantum transitions, key to high-speed and low-power superconducting electronics. In a constant applied magnetic field, with Rashba and Dresselhaus SOC, anharmonic current-phase relations, calculated microscopically in these JJs, yield a nonreciprocal transport and superconducting diode effect. Together with the time-dependent SOC, this allows us to identify a switching mechanism at no applied current bias, which supports fractional-flux-quantum superconducting circuits and neuromorphic computing.

TI "… God Said": Toward a Quantum Theology of Creation
SO OPEN THEOLOGY
AB This work argues that because Quantum Mechanics (QM) is superb at simulating natural, physical phenomena, so-called quantum-native phenomena, and that Quantum Natural Language Processing (QNLP), its child, is also quantum-native, God's generative language of physical creation is native to a quantum world; therefore, it is now possible to postulate an argument for God's creation of the world through language without requiring divine revelation. This argument is, in essence, an extension of the Augustinian argument - the baseline argument from mathematics and abstract objects - for the existence of God that accounts for contemporary advances in QM. Additionally, this work invites further research and investigation into applying category theory to model the theistic universe thereby allowing both modeling and simulations of the symbolic world.

AB We present a quantum-based approach for the optimization of join orders in database applications. Our approach relies on a hybrid framework, where classical heuristics are combined with a quantum processor to accelerate the search over the set of solutions to a constrained problem. By taking advantage of a previously introduced formulation of the join order optimization as a Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) problem, we implement it using the Constrained Quadratic Model (CQM), a hybrid classical-quantum solver that interfaces classical heuristics with D-Wave's quantum annealer. We show that even a generic implementation of this classical-quantum hybrid framework produces competitive results for the join order problem, suggesting that better-tailored hybrid solvers could produce a computational advantage.

TI Learning Mixed Strategies in Quantum Games with Imperfect Information
SO QUANTUM REPORTS
AB The quantization of games expand the players strategy space, allowing the emergence of more equilibriums. However, finding these equilibriums is difficult, especially if players are allowed to use mixed strategies. The size of the exploration space expands so much for quantum games that makes far harder to find the player's best strategy. In this work, we propose a method to learn and visualize mixed quantum strategies and compare them with their classical counterpart. In our model, players do not know in advance which game they are playing (pay-off matrix) neither the action selected nor the reward obtained by their competitors at each step, they only learn from an individual feedback reward signal. In addition, we study both the influence of entanglement and noise on the performance of various quantum games.

TI Local Readout and Control of Current and Kinetic Energy Operators in
   Optical Lattices
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB Quantum gas microscopes have revolutionized quantum simulations with ultracold atoms, allowing one to measure local observables and snapshots of quantum states. However, measurements so far were mostly carried out in the occupation basis. Here, we demonstrate how all kinetic operators, such as kinetic energy or current operators, can be measured and manipulated with single-bond resolution. Beyond simple expectation values of these observables, the single-shot measurements allow one to access full counting statistics and complex correlation functions. Our work paves the way for the implementation of efficient quantum state tomography and hybrid quantum computing protocols for itinerant particles on a lattice. In addition, we demonstrate how site-resolved programmable potentials enable a spatially selective, parallel readout in different bases as well as the engineering of arbitrary initial states.

SO COMPUTATION
AB Currently, researching the Yang-Baxter equation (YBE) is a subject of great interest among scientists of diverse areas in mathematics and other sciences. One of the fundamental open problems is to find all of its solutions. The investigation deals with developing theories such as knot theory, Hopf algebras, quandles, Lie and Jordan (super) algebras, and quantum computing. One of the most successful techniques to obtain solutions of the YBE was given by Rump, who introduced an algebraic structure called the brace, which allows giving non-degenerate involutive set-theoretical solutions. This paper introduces Brauer configuration algebras, which, after appropriate specializations, give rise to braces associated with Thompson's group F. The dimensions of these algebras and their centers are also given.

TI Work Function Engineering of Thin α-RuCl3 by Argon Sputtering
SO ADVANCED MATERIALS INTERFACES
AB alpha-RuCl3 is a candidate material for the realization of a Kitaev spin liquid with envisioned applications for quantum computing. It is a van-der-Waals material with in-plane honeycomb lattice equivalent to the CrX3 (X= Cl, Br, I) type 2D magnets. Here, possibilities of defect engineering and surface modification of thin crystals are explored by Ar+ dosing and vacuum annealing. Chlorine is easily removed from the surface, which reduces the Ru valence and eventually leaves a Ru rich surface layer behind. A peculiar thickness dependence of the work function emerges after Ar+ sputtering, which is ascribed to the remaining chlorine concentration. This work elucidates material properties of thin alpha-RuCl3 and introduces concepts of property engineering to create homojunctions and control level alignment by standard in situ methods.

The recent advances in technology to store digital data inside a deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) strand, manipulate quantum bits (qubits), perform logical operations with photons, and perform computations inside memory systems are ushering in the era of emerging paradigms of DNA computing, quantum computing, optical computing, and in-memory computing. In an orthogonal direction, research on interconnect design using advanced electro-optic, wireless, and microfluidic technologies has shown promising solutions to the architectural limitations of traditional von-Neumann computers. In this article, experts present their comments on the role of interconnects in the emerging computing paradigms, and discuss the potential use of chiplet-based architectures for the heterogeneous integration of such technologies.

TI Graph isomorphism and Gaussian boson sampling
SO SPECIAL MATRICES
AB We introduce a connection between a near-term quantum computing device, specifically a Gaussian boson sampler, and the graph isomorphism problem. We propose a scheme where graphs are encoded into quantum states of light, whose properties are then probed with photon-number-resolving detectors. We prove that the probabilities of different photon-detection events in this setup can be combined to give a complete set of graph invariants. Two graphs are isomorphic if and only if their detection probabilities are equivalent. We present additional ways that the measurement probabilities can be combined or coarse-grained to make experimental tests more amenable. We benchmark these methods with numerical simulations on the Titan supercomputer for several graph families: pairs of isospectral nonisomorphic graphs, isospectral regular graphs, and strongly regular graphs.

TI High-throughput spin-bath characterization of spin defects in
   semiconductors
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW APPLIED
AB Detailed knowledge of the local environments of spin defects in semiconductors, such as nitrogenvacancy (NV) centers in diamond or divacancies in silicon carbide, is crucial for optimizing control and entanglement protocols in quantum sensing and information applications. However, at present a direct experimental characterization of individual defect environments is not scalable, as conventional spin-bath measurements are time consuming and difficult to automate. Achieving high-throughput characterization requires short experiments to probe the spin bath. However, with fewer and noisier measurements, the inverse problem of recovering spin-bath properties from measured data becomes ill posed, with multiple spin baths having a high likelihood of yielding the same data. In this work, we present a set of computational tools to resolve the ill-posed inverse problem of recovering the atomic positions and hyperfine couplings of random nuclei surrounding spin defects from sparse, noisy experimental coherence data, which can be obtained in hours. We use a trans-dimensional Bayesian approach that incorporates ab initio data to yield full posterior distributions over nuclear spin environments, enabling robust recovery from limited data. We also provide practical tools and guidelines to determine the limits of detectability for hyperfine couplings under specific dynamical decoupling sequences and sampling conditions. In addition, we demonstrate how the tools developed here, in combination with ab initio simulations of spin baths, can guide the design of efficient experimental protocols for application-specific high-throughput screening. To showcase the utility of our approach, we apply it to design fast dynamical decoupling experiments to characterize the spin baths often individual NV centers in diamond. While the primary focus is on accelerating spin-bath characterization of spin defects, this Bayesian approach also lays the foundation for digital-twin studies of spin defects, where a virtual model of the spin-defect system evolves in real time with ongoing experimental measurements. Together, the set of tools we designed and applied paves the way for scalable deployment of spin defects in semiconductors for quantum sensing and information applications.

AB The optical tweezer experiment with neutral atoms is a focal topic in cold-atom physics due to its significant potential in quantum computing and simulation. Here we present the realization of a dual-species optical tweezer for both Rb and K atoms, taking a step towards creating a polar-molecule optical tweezer array. Initially, Rb and K atoms are collected using a dual magneto-optical trap and further cooled to 7 mu K for Rb and 10 mu K for K. By employing 850-nm tweezer beams, we demonstrate the ability to capture individual Rb or K atoms. The filling ratios of Rb and K can be finely adjusted by controlling the atomic densities of both species. Utilizing the postselection technique, we can create a deterministic array of two-species atoms, paving the way for future polar-molecule array formation.

TI Current status and future developments in predicting outcomes in
   radiation oncology
SO BRITISH JOURNAL OF RADIOLOGY
AB Advancements in data-driven technologies and the inclusion of information-rich multiomics features have significantly improved the performance of outcomes modeling in radiation oncology. For this current trend to be sustainable, challenges related to robust data modeling such as small sample size, low size to feature ratio, noisy data, as well as issues related to algorithmic modeling such as complexity, uncertainty, and interpretability, need to be mitigated if not resolved. Emerging computational technologies and new paradigms such as federated learning, human-in-the-loop, quantum computing, and novel interpretability methods show great potential in overcoming these challenges and bridging the gap towards precision outcome modeling in radiotherapy. Examples of these promising technologies will be presented and their potential role in improving outcome modeling will be discussed.

TI TCAD analysis of conditions for DIBL parameter misestimation in
   cryogenic MOSFETs
SO JAPANESE JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYSICS
AB The study aimed to theoretically investigate the transfer characteristics of MOSFETs at cryogenic temperatures to elucidate the experimental conditions affecting the accurate estimation of the drain-induced barrier lowering (DIBL) parameter. Our Technology Computer Aided Design (TCAD) simulation revealed that MOSFETs featuring an underlap between the gate and source/drain edges experience a significant shift in threshold voltage (V t) in the low drain voltage (V d) region, which causes the misestimation of the DIBL parameter. This V t change is due to a notable increase in carrier concentration within the underlap region. To mitigate misestimation in such underlap devices, confirming the dependence of the DIBL parameter on the linear region of V d serves as an effective method to ensure accurate estimation.

TI Effect of measurements on quantum speed limit
SO EPL
AB Given the initial and final states of a quantum system, the speed of transportation of state vector in the projective Hilbert space governs the quantum speed limit. Here, we ask the question: what happens to the quantum speed limit under continuous measurement process? We model the continuous measurement process by a non-Hermitian Hamiltonian which keeps the evolution of the system Schrodinger-like even under the process of measurement. Using this specific measurement model, we prove that under continuous measurement, the speed of transportation of a quantum system tends to zero. Interestingly, we also find that for small time scale, there is an enhancement of quantum speed even if the measurement strength is finite. Our findings can have applications in quantum computing and quantum control where dynamics is governed by both unitary and measurement processes.

SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICS-PHOTONICS
AB This article reviews recent progress in quasi-phasematched chi((2)) nonlinear nanophotonics, with a particular focus on dispersion-engineered nonlinear interactions. Throughout this article, we establish design rules for the bandwidth and interaction lengths of various nonlinear processes, and provide examples for how these processes can be engineered in nanophotonic devices. In particular, we apply these rules towards the design of sources of non-classical light and show that dispersion-engineered devices can outperform their conventional counterparts. Examples include ultra-broadband optical parametric amplification as a resource for measurement-based quantum computation, dispersion-engineered spontaneous parametric downconversion as a source of separable biphotons, and synchronously pumped nonlinear resonators as a potential route towards single-photon nonlinearities.

TI Probabilistic imaginary-time evolution in state-vector-based and
   shot-based simulations and on quantum devices
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Imaginary-time evolution, an important technique in tensor network and quantum Monte Carlo algorithms on classical computers, has recently been adapted to quantum computing. In this study, we focus on probabilistic imaginary-time evolution (PITE) algorithm and derive its formulation in the context of state-vector-based simulations, where quantum state vectors are directly used to compute observables without statistical errors. We compare the results with those of shot-based simulations, which estimate observables through repeated projective measurements. Applying the PITE algorithm to the Heisenberg chain, we investigate optimal initial conditions for convergence. We further demonstrate the method on the transverse-field Ising model using a state-of-the-art trapped-ion quantum device. Finally, we explore the potential of error mitigation in this framework, highlighting practical considerations for near-term digital quantum simulations.

TI Statistical quality assessment of Ising-based annealer outputs
SO QUANTUM INFORMATION PROCESSING
AB The ability to evaluate the outcomes of quantum annealers is essential for such devices to be used in complex computational tasks. We introduce a statistical test of the quality of Ising-based annealers' output based on the data only, assessing the ground state's probability of being sampled. A higher probability value implies that at least the lower part of the spectrum is a part of the sample. Assuming a plausible model of the univariate energy distribution of the sample, we express the ground-state energy and temperature as a function of cumulants up to the third order. Using the annealer samples, we evaluate this multiple times using Bootstrap resampling, resulting in an estimated histogram of ground-state energies and deduce the desired parameter on this basis. The approach provides an easily implementable method for the primary validation of Ising-based annealers' output. We demonstrate its behavior through experiments made with actual samples originating from quantum annealer devices.

TI Enhanced mobility of ternary InGaAs quantum wells through digital
   alloying
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW MATERIALS
AB High In content InGaAs quantum wells (In 75%) are potentially useful for topological quantum computing and spintronics applications. In high-mobility InGaAs quantum wells, alloy disorder scattering is a limiting factor. In this paper, we demonstrate that by growing the InGaAs quantum wells as a digital alloy, or a short period superlattice, we can reduce the alloy disorder scattering within the quantum well and increase the peak 2 K electron mobility to 545 000 cm2/Vs, which is the highest reported mobility for high-In content InGaAs quantum wells to the best of the authors' knowledge. Our results demonstrate that the digital alloy approach can be used to increase the mobility of quantum wells in random alloy ternary materials.

TI Topological dynamics and correspondences in composite exceptional rings
SO COMMUNICATIONS PHYSICS
AB The study of unconventional phases and elucidation of correspondences between topological invariants and their intriguing properties are pivotal in topological physics. Here, we investigate a complex exceptional ring (CER), composed of a third-order exceptional ring and multiple Weyl exceptional rings, and establish a direct correspondence between Chern numbers and the distinctive behaviors of these structures. We show that band braiding during quasistatic encircling processes correlates with nontrivial Chern numbers, resulting in triple (double) periodic spectra for topologically nontrivial (trivial) middle bands. Moreover, Chern numbers predict mode transfer during dynamical encircling. Experimental schemes for realizing CER in cold atoms are proposed, emphasizing the crucial role of Chern numbers as both measurable quantity and descriptor of exceptional physics in dissipative systems. This discovery broadens topological classifications in non-Hermitian systems, with promising applications in quantum computing and metrology.

TI Nanooptomechanical Transduction in a Single Crystal with 100%
   Photoconversion
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY C
AB Materials that exhibit nanooptomechanical transduction in their single-crystal form have prospective use in light-driven molecular machinery, nanotechnology, and quantum computing. Linkage photo-isomerization is typically the source of such transduction in coordination complexes, although the isomers tend to undergo only partial photo-conversion. We present a nanooptomechanical transducer, trans-[Ru(SO2)-(NH3)(4)(3-bromopyridine)]tosylate(2), whose S-bound eta(1)-SO2 isomer fully converts into an O-bound eta(1)-OSO photoisomer that is metastable while kept at 100 K. Its 100% photoconversion is confirmed structurally via photocrystallography, while single-crystal optical absorption and Raman spectroscopies reveal its metal-to-ligand charge-transfer and temperature-dependent characteristics. This perfect optical switching affords the material good prospects for nanooptomechanical transduction with single-photon control.

TI Polarimetry with Spins in the Solid State
SO NANO LETTERS
AB The ability for optically active media to rotate the polarization of light is the basis of polarimetry, a prominent technique responsible for many breakthroughs in fields as varied as astronomy, medicine, and material science. Here, we recast the primary mechanism for spin readout in semiconductor-based quantum computers, Pauli spin-blockade (PSB), as the natural extension of polarimetry to the third dimension. We perform polarimetry with spins through a silicon quantum dot exchanging a hole with a boron acceptor, demonstrating the role of spin-orbit coupling in creating spin misalignment. Perfect spin alignment may be recovered by means of rotating the applied magnetic-field orientation. This work shows how spin misalignment sets a fundamental upper limit for the spin readout fidelity in quantum-computing systems based on PSB.

AB Developing compact, low-dissipation, cryogenic-compatible microwave electronics is essential for scaling up low-temperature quantum computing systems. In this paper, we demonstrate an ultracompact microwave directional forward coupler based on high-impedance slow-wave superconducting-nanowire transmission lines. The coupling section of the fabricated device has a footprint of 416 mu m(2). At 4.753 GHz, the input signal couples equally to the through port and forward-coupling port (50:50) at -6.7 dB with -13.5 dB isolation. The coupling ratio can be controlled with dc bias current or temperature by exploiting the dependence of the kinetic inductance on these quantities. The material and fabrication processes are suitable for direct integration with superconducting circuits, providing a practical solution to the signal distribution bottlenecks in developing large-scale quantum computers.

TI When phononic crystals fail: Spatial and spectral limits of phonon
   interference
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW APPLIED
AB Phononic crystals are artificial periodic structures that leverage phonon-wave interference to control mechanical vibrations. Their practical implementations range from evenly planted trees to periodic nanostructures covering mechanical vibrations from seismic waves to sound and heat. However, the spatial and spectral limits at which phonon interference disappears are unknown. Here, we report on experimental observations of a gradual breakdown of phonon interference in two-dimensional nanoscale phononic crystals. Measured phonon dispersion relations reveal the critical dimensions and frequencies at which phonons no longer sense the in-plane periodicity of the crystal and enter an intermediate state dominated by out-of-plane interference before ceasing to interfere altogether. These findings refine the current understanding of nanoscale phonon interference and might be relevant for phononic crystal applications in microelectronics and acoustic quantum computing.

TI Unidirectional acoustic metamaterials based on nonadiabatic holonomic
   quantum transformations
SO SCIENCE CHINA-PHYSICS MECHANICS & ASTRONOMY
AB Nonadiabatic holonomic quantum transformations (NHQTs) have attracted wide attention and have been applied in many aspects of quantum computation, whereas related research is usually limited to the field of quantum physics. Here we bring NHQTs into constructing a unidirectional acoustic metamaterial (UDAM) for shaping classical beams. The UDAM is made up of an array of three-waveguide couplers, where the propagation of acoustic waves mimics the evolution of NHQTs. The excellent agreement among analytical predictions, numerical simulations, and experimental measurements confirms the great applicability of NHQTs in acoustic metamaterial engineering. The present work extends research on NHQTs from quantum physics to the field of classical waves for designing metamaterials with simple structures and may pave a new way to design UDAMs that would be of potential applications in acoustic isolation, communication, and stealth.

TI Superconducting pairing symmetry in MoTe2
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW MATERIALS
AB Topological superconductors have long been sought for their potential use in quantum computing. The type-II Weyl semimetal MoTe2 is an obvious candidate, exhibiting a superconducting state below 500 mK at ambient pressure, but the question remains whether the pairing is conventional s(++) or topological s(+-). The application of external pressure favors the superconducting state in MoTe2 and suppresses the structural transition from 1T ' to Td. The competition between the two structures leads to a mixed phase that strongly enhances the disorder present in the system, remarkably without affecting the superconducting transition temperature, in contrast to the expectation of s(+-) pairing superconductivity.

TI Quantum game- "PQ" problem
SO ACTA PHYSICA SINICA
AB This paper reviews the coin flipping problem of "PQ" in a classical two-player game, and shows that whenone player adopts quantum strategy, he can beat his classical opponent and gain higher returns. By usingquantitative means, the whole "PQ" problem is put under a more general and fair condition, and it isgeneralized and studied again from many aspects and angles. Finally, we obtain some more essential andimportant conclusions, and explain the conclusions and its practical significance through some practicalexamples. At the same time, this paper gives the definition of imperfect fair game and the definition of perfectfair game, revises the quantum coin flipping game to make the game fair, and studies a multi-round version ofquantum coin flipping. Some basic conclusions of fair quantum game are obtained, and the meaning of perfectlyfair game is explained in practice

TI Optimizing magnetic heating of isolated magnetic nanowires (MNWs) by
   simulation
SO AIP ADVANCES
AB Magnetic properties such as coercivity, remanence and saturation magnetization will determine the area enclosed by the hysteresis loop of a magnetic material, which also represents magnetic heating. Nanowarming of cryopreserved organs is a new application for magnetic heating using nanoparticles. In this paper, isolated Ni MNW of different sizes and shapes are studied via micromagnetic simulation to explore the optimization of heating using individual MNW. Ellipsoidal MNWs with small (30nm) diameters turn out to be most promising in heating ability due to their large hysteresis area and their potential to distribute uniformly in an organ that is being heated. In addition to optimized heating, a special switching pattern of magnetic moment was also observed for cylindrical large (200nm) MNW. This special switching pattern can trigger applications such as quantum computing. (C) 2022 Author(s).

TI Rapidity evolution of the entanglement entropy in quarkonium: Parton and
   string duality
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW D
AB We investigate the quantum entanglement in rapidity space of the soft gluon wave function of a quarkonium in theories with nontrivial rapidity evolutions. We found that the rapidity evolution drastically changes the behavior of the entanglement entropy, at any given order in perturbation theory. At large N-c, the reduced density matrices that "resum" the leading rapidity logs can be explicitly constructed, and shown to satisfy Balitsky-Kovchegov-like evolution equations. We study their entanglement entropy in a simplified 1 + 1 toy model and in 3D QCD. The entanglement entropy in these cases, after resummation, is shown to saturate the Kolmogorov-Sinai bound of 1. Remarkably, in 3D QCD the essential growth rate of the entanglement entropy is found to vanish at large rapidities, a result of kinematical "quenching" in transverse space. The one-body reduction of the entangled density matrix obeys a Balitsky-Fadin-KuraevLipatov evolution equation, which can be recast as an evolution in an emergent AdS space, at large impact parameter and large rapidity. This observation allows the extension of the perturbative wee parton evolution at low x, to a dual nonperturbative evolution of string bits in curved AdS(5) space, with manifest entanglement entropy in the confining regime.

TI Flexible Type-Based Resource Estimation in Quantum Circuit Description
   Languages
SO PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACM ON PROGRAMMING LANGUAGES-PACMPL
AB We introduce a type system for the Quipper language designed to derive upper bounds on the size of the circuits produced by the typed program. This size can be measured according to various metrics, including width, depth and gate count, but also variations thereof obtained by considering only some wire types or some gate kinds. The key ingredients for achieving this level of flexibility are effects and refinement types, both relying on indices, that is, generic arithmetic expressions whose operators are interpreted differently depending on the target metric. The approach is shown to be correct through logical predicates, under reasonable assumptions about the chosen resource metric. This approach is empirically evaluated through the QuRA tool, showing that, in many cases, inferring tight bounds is possible in a fully automatic way.

TI Best practices in the measurement of circularly polarised photodetectors
SO JOURNAL OF MATERIALS CHEMISTRY C
AB Circularly polarised light will revolutionise emerging technologies, including encrypted light-based communications, quantum computing, bioimaging and multi-channel data processing. In order to make use of these remarkable opportunities, high performance photodetectors that can accurately differentiate between left- and right-handed circularly polarised light are desperately needed. Whilst this potential has resulted in considerable research interest in chiral materials and circularly polarised photodetecting devices, their translation into real-world technologies is limited by non-standardised reporting and testing protocols. This mini-review provides an accessible introduction into the working principles of circularly polarised photodetectors and a comprehensive overview of the performance metrics of state-of-the-art devices. We propose a rigorous device characterisation procedure that will allow for standardised evaluation of novel devices, which we hope will accelerate research and investment in this area.

SO PHYSICAL REVIEW MATERIALS
AB Using high-throughput automation of ab initio impurity embedding simulations, we create a database of 3d and 4d transition metal defects embedded into the prototypical topological insulators (TIs) Bi2Te3 and Bi2Se3. We simulate both single impurities as well as impurity dimers at different impurity-impurity distances inside the topological insulator matrix. We extract changes to magnetic moments, analyze the polarizability of nonmagnetic impurity atoms via nearby magnetic impurity atoms and calculate the exchange coupling constants for a Heisenberg Hamiltonian. We uncover chemical trends in the exchange coupling constants and discuss the impurities' abilities with respect to magnetic order in the fields of quantum anomalous Hall insulators and topological quantum computing. In particular, we confirm that co-doping of different magnetic dopants is a viable strategy to engineer the magnetic ground state in magnetic TIs.

TI Reductive quantum phase estimation
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Estimating a quantum phase is a necessary task in a wide range of fields of quantum science. To accomplish this task, two well-known methods have been developed in distinct contexts, namely, Ramsey interferometry (RI) in atomic and molecular physics and quantum phase estimation (QPE) in quantum computing. We demonstrate that these canonical examples are instances of a larger class of phase estimation protocols, which we call reductive quantum phase estimation (RQPE) circuits. Here, we present an explicit algorithm that allows one to create an RQPE circuit. This circuit distinguishes an arbitrary set of phases with a smaller number of qubits and unitary applications, thereby solving a general class of quantum hypothesis testing to which RI and QPE belong. We further demonstrate a tradeoff between measurement precision and phase distinguishability, which allows one to tune the circuit to be optimal for a specific application.

Within the scope of Ginzburg-Landau theory, we find that the nanobridge ScS transmon has an improved charge dispersion compared to the SIS transmon, with a tradeoff of smaller anharmonicity. These calculations provide a framework for estimating the superconductor material properties and junction dimensions compatible with gigahertz frequency ScS transmon operation.

TI Parametric instability landscape of coupled Kerr parametric oscillators
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Networks of coupled Kerr parametric oscillators (KPOs) hold promise for the realization of neuromorphic and quantum computation. Yet, their rich bifurcation structure remains poorly understood. Here, we employ secular perturbation theory to map the stability regions of these networks and identify the regime where the system can be mapped to an Ising model. Starting with two coupled KPOs, we show how the bifurcations arise from the competition between the global parametric drive and linear coupling between the KPOs. We then extend this framework to larger networks with all-to-all equal coupling, deriving analytical expressions for the full cascade of bifurcation transitions. In the thermodynamic limit, we find that these transitions become uniformly spaced, leading to a highly regular structure. Our results reveal the precise bounds under which KPO networks have an Ising-like solution space, and thus provide crucial guidance for their experimental implementation.

TI Homomorphic Logical Measurements
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB Shor and Steane ancillae are two well-known methods for fault-tolerant logical measurements, which are successful on small codes and their concatenations. On large quantum low-density-parity-check codes, however, Shor and Steane measurements have impractical time and space overhead, respectively. In this work, we widen the choice of ancilla codes by unifying Shor and Steane measurements into a single framework, called homomorphic measurements. For any Calderbank-Shor-Steane code with the appropriate ancilla code, one can avoid repetitive measurements or complicated ancilla state preparation procedures such as distillation, which overcomes the difficulties of both Shor and Steane methods. As an example, we utilize the theory of covering spaces to construct homomorphic measurement protocols for arbitrary X- or Z-type logical Pauli operators on surface codes in general, including the toric code and hyperbolic surface codes. Conventional surface code decoders, such as minimum-weight perfect matching, can be directly applied to our constructions.

TI Fault-Tolerant Logical Measurements via Homological Measurement
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW X
AB We introduce homological measurement, a framework for measuring the logical Pauli operators encoded in Calderbank-Shor-Steane stabilizer codes. The framework is based on the algebraic description of such codes as chain complexes. Protocols such as lattice surgery and some of its recent generalizations are shown to be special cases of homological measurement. Using this framework, we develop a specific protocol called edge expanded homological measurement for fault-tolerant measurement of arbitrary logical Pauli operators of general quantum low density parity-check codes, requiring a number of ancillary qubits growing only linearly with the weight of the logical operator measured, and guarantee that the distance of the code is preserved. We further benchmark our protocol numerically in a photonic architecture based on Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill qubits, showing that the logical error rates of various codes are on par with other methods requiring more ancilla qubits.

TI Quadrupole spin polarization as signature of second-order topological

SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
AB We study theoretically second-order topological superconductors characterized by the presence of pairs of zero-energy Majorana corner states. We uncover a quadrupole spin polarization at the system edges that provides a striking signature to identify topological phases, thereby complementing standard approaches based on zero-bias conductance peaks due to Majorana corner states. We consider two different classes of second-order topological superconductors with broken time-reversal symmetry and show that both classes are characterized by a quadrupolar structure of the spin polarization that disappears as the system passes through the topological phase transition. This feature can be accessed experimentally using spin-polarized scanning tunneling microscopes. We study different models hosting second-order topological phases, both analytically and numerically, and using Keldysh techniques we provide numerical simulations of the spin-polarized currents probed by scanning tips.

Recently, K2Cr3As3 and its variants with critical temperature Tc as high as 8 kelvin have emerged as a new class of superconductors with ferromagnetic spin fluctuations. Here, we report a discovery in K2Cr3As3 single crystal that the spin susceptibility measured by As-75 Knight shift below T-c is unchanged with the magnetic field H-0 applied in the ab plane but vanishes toward zero temperature when H-0 is along the c axis, which unambiguously establishes this compound as a spin-triplet superconductor described by a vector order parameter (d) over right arrow parallel to the c axis. Combining with point nodal gap, we show that K2Cr3As3 is a new platform for the study of topological superconductivity and its possible technical application.

AB A realistic material may possess defects, which often bring the material new properties that have practical applications. The boundary defects of a two-dimensional topologically ordered system are thought of as an alternative way of realizing topological quantum computation. To facilitate the study of such boundary defects, in this paper, we construct an exactly solvable Hamiltonian model of topological orders with gapped boundary junctions, where the boundary defects reside, by placing the Levin-Wen model on a disk, whose gapped boundary is separated into multiple segments by junctions. We derive a formula of the ground state degeneracy and an explicit ground-state basis of our model. We propose the notion of mobile and immobile charges on the boundary and find that they are quantum observables and label the ground-state basis. Our model is computation friendly.

TI Tailoring Term Truncations for Electronic Structure Calculations Using a
   Linear Combination of Unitaries
SO QUANTUM
AB A highly anticipated use of quantum computers is the simulation of complex quantum systems including molecules and other many-body systems. One promising method involves directly applying a linear combination of unitaries (LCU) to approximate a Taylor series by truncating after some order. Here we present an adaptation of that method, optimized for Hamiltonians with terms of widely varying magnitude, as is commonly the case in electronic structure calculations. We show that it is more efficient to apply LCU using a truncation that retains larger magnitude terms as determined by an iterative procedure. We obtain bounds on the simulation error for this generalized truncated Taylor method, and for a range of molecular simulations, we report these bounds as well as exact numerical results. We find that our adaptive method can typically improve the simulation accuracy by an order of magnitude, for a given circuit depth.

TI Complexity conjecture of regular electric black holes
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW D
AB Recently, the action growth rate of a variety of four-dimensional regular magnetic black holes in the F frame was obtained by El Moumni and Masmar [Nucl. Phys. B950, 114837 (2020)]. Here, we study the action growth rate of a four-dimensional regular electric black hole in the P frame that is the Legendre transformation of the F frame. We also investigate the action growth rates of the Wheeler-De Witt patch for such black hole configurations at the late time and examine the Lloyd bound on the rate of quantum computation. We show that although the form of the Lloyd bound formula remains unaltered, the energy modifies due to a nonvanishing trace of the energy-momentum tensor, and some extra terms may appear in the total growth action. We also investigate the asymptotic behavior of complexity in two conjectures for static and rotating regular black holes.

TI Erasable Superconductivity in Topological Insulator
   Bi2Se3 Induced by Voltage Pulse
SO ADVANCED QUANTUM TECHNOLOGIES
AB 3D topological insulators attract much attention due to their topologically protected Dirac surface states. Doping into topological insulators or their proximity with normal superconductors can promote the realization of topological superconductivity and Majorana fermions with potential applications in quantum computation. Here, an emergent superconductivity is observed in local mesoscopic point-contacts on the topological insulator Bi2Se3 by applying a voltage pulse through the contacts, evidenced by the Andreev reflection peak in the point-contact spectra and a visible resistance drop in the four-probe electrical resistance measurements. More intriguingly, the superconductivity can be erased with thermal cycles by warming up to high temperatures (300 K) and induced again by the voltage pulse at the base temperature (1.9 K), suggesting a significance for designing new types of quantum devices. Nematic behavior is also observed in the superconducting state, similar to the case of CuxBi2Se3 as topological superconductor candidates.

TI Reentrant superconductivity in proximity to a topological insulator
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
AB Superconducting hybrid structures with topological order and induced magnetization offer a promising way to realize fault-tolerant quantum computation. However, the effect of the interplay between magnetization and the property of the topological insulator surface, otherwise known as spin-momentum locking on the superconducting proximity effect, still remains to be investigated. We relied on the quasiclassical self-consistent approach to consider the superconducting transition temperature in the two-dimensional superconductor/topological insulator (S/TI) junction with an in-plane helical magnetization on the TI surface. It has emerged that the presence of the helical magnetization leads to the nonmonotonic dependence of the critical temperature on the TI thickness for both cases when the magnetization evolves along or perpendicular to the interface. The results obtained can be helpful for designing novel superconducting nanodevices and better understanding the nature of superconductivity in S/TI systems with nonuniform magnetization.

TI Tracking a nonrelativistic charge with an array of Rydberg atoms
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Charged particle tracking has played a key role in the development of particle physics, particularly for understanding phenomena involving short-lived particles precisely. As a platform for high-resolution charged particle tracking, an array of Rydberg atoms is theoretically analyzed. Utilizing the Ramsey sequence to accumulate the phase shift between the ground and a Rydberg excited state induced by the time-dependent Stark shift due to a moving charge, a nonrelativistic charged particle can be tracked with a precision of similar to 10 nm, with a potential of higher resolution by optimizing reconstruction algorithm. Although a lot of technical difficulties need to be resolved, the proposed scheme can potentially serve as a charge tracker for relativistic charged particles as well. Also, this analysis can explain potential decoherence in the quantum computation with Rydberg atoms induced by residual ions and cosmic rays.

TI Optimal fidelity estimation for density matrix
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB Fidelity estimation is a necessary tool for evaluating noise in quantum measurement and quantum computation. The traditional fidelity estimation is to calculate the distance between two density matrices by employing direct fidelity estimation, which consumes too much copies of state. To reduce the number of copies of the state, we develop optimal fidelity estimation by proposing an optimal model. It calculates the minimum number of copies of state given a fixed value for the fidelity deviation. The result shows it saves a large number of copies of state compared with traditional approach (Direct Fidelity estimation) that is developed several years ago.The number of copies of the state employed increases slower than linear increase with increase of the dimension of density matrix when pauli measurement basis is applied. In addition, it consumes roughly a constant number of copies of the state with the increase of dimension of density matrix when the measurement bases are freely chosen.

TI BlockBP decoder for the surface code
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB We present a new decoder for the surface code, which combines the accuracy of the tensor-network decoders with the efficiency and parallelism of the belief-propagation algorithm. Our main idea is to replace the expensive tensor-network contraction step in the tensor-network decoders with the blockBP algorithm-a recent approximate contraction algorithm, based on belief propagation. Our decoder is therefore a belief-propagation decoder that works in the degenerate maximal likelihood decoding framework. Unlike conventional tensor-network decoders, our algorithm can run efficiently in parallel, and may therefore be suitable for real-time decoding. We numerically test our decoder and show that for a large range of lattice sizes and noise levels it delivers a logical error probability that outperforms the Minimal Weight Perfect Matching decoder, sometimes by more than an order of magnitude.

TI Topological Degeneracy Induced Flat Bands in Two-Dimensional Holed
   Systems
SO CHINESE PHYSICS LETTERS
AB Systems hosting flat bands offer a powerful platform for exploring strong correlation physics. Theoretically, topological degeneracy arising in systems with non-trivial topological orders on periodic manifolds of non-zero genus can generate ideal flat bands. However, experimental realization of such geometrically engineered systems is very difficult. In this work, we demonstrate that flat planes with strategically patterned hole defects can engineer ideal flat bands. We construct two families of models: singular flat band systems where degeneracy is stabilized by non-contractible loop excitations tied to hole defects and perfectly nested van Hove systems where degeneracy arises from line excitations in momentum space. These models circumvent the need for exotic manifolds while retaining the essential features of topological flat bands. By directly linking defect engineering to degeneracy mechanisms, our results establish a scalable framework for experimentally accessible flat band design.

TI Symmetry fractionalized (irrationalized) fusion rules and two
   domain-wall Verlinde formulae
SO JOURNAL OF HIGH ENERGY PHYSICS
AB We investigate the composite systems consisting of topological orders separated by gapped domain walls. We derive a pair of domain-wall Verlinde formulae, that elucidate the connection between the braiding of interdomain excitations labeled by pairs of anyons in different domains and quasiparticles in the gapped domain wall with their respective fusion rules. Through explicit non-Abelian examples, we showcase the calculation of such braiding and fusion, revealing that the fusion rules for interdomain excitations are generally fractional or irrational. By investigating the correspondence between composite systems and anyon condensation, we unveil the reason for designating these fusion rules as symmetry fractionalized (irrationalized) fusion rules. Our findings hold promise for applications across various fields, such as topological quantum computation, topological field theory, conformal field theory, and parton physics.

TI Hardware-Efficient Microwave-Activated Tunable Coupling between
   Superconducting Qubits
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB Generating high-fidelity, tunable entanglement between qubits is crucial for realizing gate-based quantum computation. In superconducting circuits, tunable interactions are often implemented using flux tunable qubits or coupling elements, adding control complexity and noise sources. Here, we realize a tunable ZZ interaction between two transmon qubits with fixed frequencies and fixed coupling, induced by driving both transmons off resonantly. We show tunable coupling over 1 order of magnitude larger than the static coupling, and change the sign of the interaction, enabling cancellation of the idle coupling. Further, this interaction is amenable to large quantum processors: the drive frequency can be flexibly chosen to avoid spurious transitions, and because both transmons are driven, it is resilient to microwave cross talk. We apply this interaction to implement a controlled phase (CZ) gate with a gate fidelity of 99.43(1)% as measured by cycle benchmarking, and we find the fidelity is limited by incoherent errors.

   atomic ensembles
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB We study the collective radiation properties of cold, trapped ensembles of atoms. We consider the high-density regime with the mean interatomic distance being comparable to, or smaller than, the wavelength of the resonant optical radiation emitted by the atoms. We find that the emission rate of a photon from an excited atomic ensemble is strongly enhanced for an elongated cloud. We analyze collective single-excitation eigenstates of the atomic ensemble and find that the absorption-emission spectrum is broadened and shifted to lower frequencies as compared to the noninteracting (low-density) or single-atom spectrum. We also analyze the spatial and temporal profile of the emitted radiation. Finally, we explore how to efficiently excite the collective superradiant states of the atomic ensemble from a long-lived storage state in order to implement matter-light interfaces for quantum computation and communication applications.

AB A versatile magnetometer must deliver a readable response when exposed to target fields in a wide range of parameters. In this work, we experimentally demonstrate that the combination of(171)Yb(+) atomic sensors with adequately trained neural networks enables us to investigate target fields in distinct challenging scenarios. In particular, we characterize radio frequency (RF) fields in the presence of large shot noise, including the limit case of continuous data acquisition via single-shot measurements. Furthermore, by incorporating neural networks we significantly extend the working regime of atomic magnetometers into scenarios in which the RF driving induces responses beyond their standard harmonic behavior. Our results indicate the benefits to integrate neural networks at the data processing stage of general quantum sensing tasks to decipher the information contained in the sensor responses.

TI Encoding Classical Information Into Quantum Resources
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INFORMATION THEORY
AB We introduce and analyse the problem of encoding classical information into different resources of a quantum state. More precisely, we consider a general class of communication scenarios characterised by encoding operations that commute with a unique resource destroying map and leave free states invariant. Our motivating example is given by encoding information into coherences of a quantum system with respect to a fixed basis (with unitaries diagonal in that basis as encodings and the decoherence channel as a resource destroying map), but the generality of the framework allows us to explore applications ranging from super-dense coding to thermodynamics. For any state, we find that the number of messages that can be encoded into it using such operations in a one-shot scenario is upper bounded in terms of the information spectrum relative entropy between the given state and its version with erased resources. Furthermore, if the resource destroying map is the twirling channel over some unitary group, we find matching one-shot lower bounds as well. In the asymptotic setting where we encode into many copies of the resource state, our bounds yield an operational interpretation of resource monotones such as the relative entropy of coherence and its corresponding relative entropy variance.

TI Identifying Quantum Mechanical Statistics in Italian Corpora
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF THEORETICAL PHYSICS
AB We present a theoretical and empirical investigation of the statistical behaviour of the words in a text produced by human language. To this aim, we analyse the word distribution of various texts of Italian language selected from a specific literary corpus. We firstly generalise a theoretical framework elaborated by ourselves to identify 'quantum mechanical statistics' in large-size texts. Then, we show that, in all analysed texts, words distribute according to 'Bose-Einstein statistics' and show significant deviations from 'Maxwell-Boltzmann statistics'. Next, we introduce an effect of 'word randomization' which instead indicates that the difference between the two statistical models is not as pronounced as in the original cases. These results confirm the empirical patterns obtained in texts of English language and strongly indicate that identical words tend to 'clump together' as a consequence of their meaning, which can be explained as an effect of 'quantum entanglement' produced through a phenomenon of 'contextual updating'. More, word randomization can be seen as the linguistic-conceptual equivalent of an increase of temperature which destroys 'coherence' and makes classical statistics prevail over quantum statistics. Some insights into the origin of quantum statistics in physics are finally provided.

TI Phase biasing of a Josephson junction using Rashba-Edelstein effect
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB A charge-current-induced shift in the spin-locked Fermi surface leads to a non-equilibrium spin density at a Rashba interface, commonly known as the Rashba-Edelstein effect. Since this is an intrinsically interfacial property, direct detection of the spin moment is difficult. Here we demonstrate that a planar Josephson Junction, realized by placing two closely spaced superconducting electrodes over a Rashba interface, allows for a direct detection of the spin moment as an additional phase in the junction. Asymmetric Fraunhofer patterns obtained for Nb-(Pt/Cu)-Nb nano-junctions, due to the locking of Rashba-Edelstein spin moment to the flux quantum in the junction, provide clear signatures of this effect. This simple experiment offers a fresh perspective on direct detection of spin polarization induced by various spin-orbit effects. In addition, this platform also offers a magnetic-field-controlled phase biasing mechanism in conjunction with the Rashba-Edelstein spin-orbit effect for superconducting quantum circuits.

TI Entanglement-Induced Barren Plateaus
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB We argue that an excess in entanglement between the visible and hidden units in a quantum neural network can hinder learning. In particular, we show that quantum neural networks that satisfy a volume law in the entanglement entropy will give rise to models that are not suitable for learning with high probability. Using arguments from quantum thermodynamics, we then show that this volume law is typical and that there exists a barren plateau in the optimization landscape due to entanglement. More precisely, we show that for any bounded objective function on the visible layers, the Lipshitz constants of the expectation value of that objective function will scale inversely with the dimension of the hidden subsystem with high probability. We show how this can cause both gradient-descent and gradient-free methods to fail. We note that similar problems can happen with quantum Boltzmann machines, although stronger assumptions on the coupling between the hidden and/or visible subspaces are necessary. We highlight how pretraining such generative models may provide a way to navigate these barren plateaus.

TI Scaling up a sign-ordered Kitaev chain without magnetic flux control
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Quantum-dot-superconductor arrays have emerged as a new and promising material platform for realizing topological Kitaev chains. So far, experiments have implemented a two-site chain with limited protection. Here, we propose an experimentally feasible protocol for scaling up the chain in order to enhance the protection of the Majorana zero modes. To this end, we make use of the fact that the relative sign of normal and superconducting hoppings mediated by an Andreev bound state can be changed by electrostatic gates. In this way, our method only relies on the use of individual electrostatic gates on hybrid regions, quantum dots, and tunnel barriers, respectively, without the need for individual magnetic flux control, greatly simplifying the device design. Our work provides guidance for realizing a topologically protected Kitaev chain, which is the building block of error-resilient topological quantum computation.

TI Chiral-Quantum-Optics-Based Supervised Learning
SO ANNALEN DER PHYSIK
AB Based on the excellent control of single photons realized by atom-photon-chiral couplings,a novel quantum-optics scheme for supervised learning is proposed. The single-photon rotating and phase-shift operations, which can be controlled by another single photon, are realized by proper atom-photon-chiral couplings. Then, an algorithm to perform the supervised learning tasks, composed by integrating the realized gates, and implemented by the tunable gate parameters, is realized.

TI Clock Precision beyond the Standard Quantum Limit at 10-18 Level
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB Optical atomic clocks with unrivaled precision and accuracy have advanced the frontier of precision measurement science and opened new avenues for exploring fundamental physics. A fundamental limitation on clock precision is the standard quantum limit (SQL), which stems from the uncorrelated projection noise of each atom. State-of-the-art optical lattice clocks interrogate large ensembles to minimize the SQL, but density-dependent frequency shifts pose challenges to scaling the atom number. The SQL can be surpassed, however, by leveraging entanglement, though it remains an open problem to achieve quantum advantage from spin squeezing at state-of-the-art stability levels. Here, we demonstrate clock performance beyond the SQL, achieving a fractional frequency precision of 1.1 x 10-18 for a single spin-squeezed clock. With cavity-based quantum nondemolition measurements, we prepare two spin-squeezed ensembles of 30 000 strontium atoms confined in a two-dimensional optical lattice. A synchronous clock comparison with an interrogation time of 61 ms achieves a metrological improvement of 2.0(2) dB beyond the SQL, after correcting for state preparation and measurement errors. These results establish the most precise entanglement-enhanced clock to date and offer a powerful platform for exploring the interplay of gravity and quantum entanglement.

TI Recent Progress in Nonlinear Frequency Conversion of Optical Vortex
   Lasers
SO FRONTIERS IN PHYSICS
AB Optical vortices are optical fields that possess a helical phase and orbital angular momentum, which have found the application in micromanipulation, optical communication, orbital angular momentum entanglement, super-resolution imaging, metrology, etc. The urgent need for the wide spreading applications of vortex lasers is to increase the wavelength versatility. In this study, the nonlinear frequency conversion of vortex lasers with a focus on sum frequency generation stimulated Raman scattering, and optical parametric oscillators were meticulously reviewed. The characteristics of the topological charge transfer and output beam profiles of different frequency conversion were discussed. As the precise tuning of optical fields in both temporal and spatial domains shall be the trend of future studies, it is our hope that this review shall serve as a reference for future research. Combining these techniques with the streaming methods to produce optical vortices, i.e., annular pump, off-axis pump, reflection mirror with defect spots, spherical aberration, and birefringence, it is advisable to expand the wavelength and fill the wavelength gap in the ultraviolet, visible, and infrared bands.

TI Recent progress in all-fiber ultrafast high-order mode lasers
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICS-PHOTONICS
AB Ultrafast high-order mode (HOM) lasers are a relatively new class of ultrafast optics. They play a significant role in the fieldsof scientific research and industrial applications due to the high peak power and unique properties of spatial intensity and polarization distribution. Generation of ultrafast HOM beams in all-fiber systems has become an important research direction. In this paper, all-fiber mode conversion techniques, pulsed HOM laser strategies, and few-mode/multi-mode fiber (FMF/MMF) lasers are reviewed. The main motivation of this review is to highlight recent advances in the field of all-fiber ultrafast HOM lasers, for example, generating different HOM pulses based on fiber mode converters and mode-locking in the FMF/MMF lasers. These results suggest that mode selective coupler can be used as a broad bandwidth mode converter with fast response and HOM can be directly oscillated in the FMF/MMF laser cavity with high stability. In addition, spatiotemporal mode-locking in the FMF/MMF is also involved. It is believed that the development of all-fiber ultrafast HOM lasers will continue to deepen, thus laying a good foundation for future applications.

TI Electric-Circuit Realization of Fast Search
SO RESEARCH
AB Quantum search algorithm, which can search an unsorted database quadratically faster than any known classical algorithms, has become one of the most impressive showcases of quantum computation. It has been implemented using various quantum schemes. Here, we demonstrate both theoretically and experimentally that such a fast search algorithm can also be realized using classical electric circuits. The classical circuit networks to perform such a fast search have been designed. It has been shown that the evolution of electric signals in the circuit networks is analogies of quantum particles randomly walking on graphs described by quantum theory. The searching efficiencies in our designed classical circuits are the same to the quantum schemes. Because classical circuit networks possess good scalability and stability, the present scheme is expected to avoid some problems faced by the quantum schemes. Thus, our findings are advantageous for information processing in the era of big data.

TI Wide edge state supercontinuum in a Floquet-Lieb topological photonic
   insulator
SO APL PHOTONICS
AB Conventional topological photonic insulators typically have narrow nontrivial band gaps truncated by broad dispersive bulk bands, resulting in limited edge mode transmission bandwidths that can be exploited for potential applications. Here, we demonstrate a Floquet-Lieb topological photonic insulator with all flat bands that can support continuous edge mode transmission across multiple Floquet-Brillouin zones. This supercontinuum of edge states results from the coexistence and orthogonality of the localized flat-band modes and the edge states, allowing for continuous excitation of the latter without scattering into the bulk modes. Moreover, we show that these flat bands are perfectly immune to random variations in the on-site potential, regardless of how large the perturbations are, thus ensuring complete robustness of the edge modes to this type of disorder. We realized Floquet-Lieb insulators using 2D microring resonator lattices with perfect nearest-neighbor couplings. Transmission measurements and direct imaging of the scattered light distributions showed an edge mode supercontinuum spanning more than three microring free spectral ranges. The proposed Floquet-Lieb insulator can potentially be used to realize topological photonic devices with wide bandwidths and super robustness for applications in integrated quantum photonics and programmable photonic circuits.

TI High-Q photonic crystal Fabry-Pérot micro-resonator in thin-film lithium
   niobate
SO APL PHOTONICS
AB Thin-film lithium niobate (TFLN) has emerged as a powerful platform for integrated nonlinear and quantum photonics, owing to its strong optical nonlinearities, wide transparency window, and electro- and piezo-optic properties. However, conventional traveling-wave resonators-such as micro-rings, disks, and racetracks-suffer from curvature-dependent group dispersion and losses, limited spectral tunability, and parasitic nonlinearities, which constrain their performance, scalability, and operational stability in nonlinear photonic circuits. Here, we present photonic crystal (PhC) Fabry-P & eacute;rot (FP) micro-resonators in TFLN that address these limitations. The device features a one-dimensional straight cavity bounded by PhC reflectors and supports well-confined standing-wave resonant modes within an engineered photonic bandgap. We achieve intrinsic quality (Q) factors of up to 1.4 x 10(6) and demonstrate that both the free spectral range (FSR) and coupling strength can be consistently controlled via cavity length and PhC coupler design, respectively. The photonic bandgap is tunable across the S-, C-, and L-bands without degradation of resonator performance. Spectral confinement of high-Q resonant modes is expected to mitigate parasitic nonlinearities, such as Raman scattering. These advances, together with the one-dimensional geometry, establish PhC FP micro-resonators as compact and scalable building blocks for high-density photonic integrated circuits targeting next-generation nonlinear and quantum applications.

TI Composite Raman-Nath heterodyne interferometry with relevance for
   precise spectroscopy
SO OPTICS AND LASER TECHNOLOGY
AB Atomic state manipulation by laser radiation requires a stringent control of the light phase noise for precise spectroscopy and quantum computation. In this work we describe a novel interferometer recently employed to estimate the phase noise induced by an optical frequency shifter based on serrodyne modulation for optical frequency standards (Barbiero et al., 2023). The interferometer is generated by an acousto-optic actuator working in the Raman-Nath regime. Using the heterodyne detection between the unshifted optical mode with the first higher order optical components, we are able to detect the differential phase between the two optical path arms with a reduction of the phase noise induced by the actuator. We provide a theoretical treatment for the actuator phase suppression and we estimate the detectable phase noise limit of this interferometer. Finally, we discuss the possible applications in the field of precision measurements.

TI Disorder enhanced vibrational entanglement and dynamics in polaritonic
   chemistry
SO COMMUNICATIONS PHYSICS
AB Collectively coupling molecular ensembles to a cavity has been demonstrated to modify chemical reactions akin to catalysis. Theoretically understanding this experimental finding remains an important challenge. In particular the role of quantum effects in such setups is an open question of fundamental and practical interest. Theoretical descriptions often neglect quantum entanglement between nuclear and electro-photonic degrees of freedom, e.g., by computing Ehrenfest dynamics. Here we discover that disorder can strongly enhance the build-up of this entanglement on short timescales after incoherent photo-excitation. We find that this can have direct consequences for nuclear coordinate dynamics. We analyze this phenomenon in a disordered Holstein-Tavis-Cummings model, a minimal toy model that includes all fundamental degrees of freedom. Using a numerical technique based on matrix product states we simulate the exact quantum dynamics of more than 100 molecules. Our results highlight the importance of beyond Born-Oppenheimer theories in polaritonic chemistry.
   Experiments have shown that coupling ensembles of molecules to a cavity mode can modify chemical reactions, though theoretical studies have struggled to model the complexity of this many-body system. Here, matrix product states are used to study the reaction-relevant many-body quantum dynamics, revealing the importance of disorder on entanglement build-up.

TI Generation of cylindrical optical lattices: from shape-invariant to

SO CHINESE OPTICS LETTERS
AB Propagation-invariant beams have attracted major attention and presented applications in research areas such as particle acceleration, optical tweezers, and optical coherence tomography. On the basis of the introduced radial cosine phase gratings with high diffraction efficiency, this study observes a kind of novel shape-invariant radial lattice by assessing its Fresnel diffraction. Then, on the stationary phase principle, we originally construct and experimentally generate a family of new propagation-invariant (non-diffracting) radial lattices with polar symmetry. Their optical structures, propagation characteristics, and distinctive phase characteristics are studied. This study has important value for applying it in scientific fields in the future given that lattices have offered many applications, including optical communication in free space, quantum computation, quantum phase transition, spin-exchange interaction, and realization of magnetic fields.

TI Exchange-selective excitation pulses for dynamic magnetic resonance
SO SCIENCE ADVANCES
AB Coherent evolution is punctuated by dynamical processes such as chemical exchange, conformational transformation, or site hopping in many important problems ranging from biomolecular function to ion trap quantum computation. One well-explored example is nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, where experimental development is grounded in decades-old theory, but structural dynamics are not easily integrated into this picture. Here, we introduce an approach that selectively excites NMR resonances that undergo chemical exchange while suppressing the signal arising from nondynamic components of the system. We show that for exchange rates spanning more than four orders of magnitude, one can still selectively excite spins undergoing exchange while suppressing static resonances. Generalizing this approach, to selectively excite (or selectively preserve) only members of an ensemble that have undergone exchange or rearrangement, has the potential to improve the analytical power of many spectroscopic techniques.

TI Multipartite entanglement of the topologically ordered state in a
   perturbed toric code
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB We demonstrate that multipartite entanglement, witnessed by the quantum Fisher information, can characterize topological quantum phase transitions in the spin-21 toric code model (TCM) on a square lattice with external fields. We show that the quantum Fisher information density of the ground state can be written in terms of the expectation values of gauge-invariant Wilson loops for different sizes of square regions and identify Z(2) topological order by its scaling behavior. Furthermore, we use this multipartite entanglement witness to investigate thermalization and disorder-assisted stabilization of topological order after a quantum quench. Moreover, with an upper bound of the quantum Fisher information, we demonstrate the absence of finite-temperature topological order in the two-dimensional TCM in the thermodynamic limit. Our results provide insights to topological phases, which are robust against external disturbances and are candidates for topologically protected quantum computation.

TI Quantum Bandit With Amplitude Amplification Exploration in an
   Adversarial Environment
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON KNOWLEDGE AND DATA ENGINEERING
AB The rapid proliferation of learning systems in an arbitrarily changing environment mandates the need to manage tensions between exploration and exploitation. This work proposes a quantum-inspired bandit learning approach for the learning-and-adapting-based offloading problem where a client observes and learns the costs of each task offloaded to the candidate resource providers, e.g., fog nodes. In this approach, a new action update strategy and novel probabilistic action selection are adopted, provoked by the amplitude amplification and collapse postulate in quantum computation theory. We devise a locally linear mapping between a quantum-mechanical phase in a quantum domain, e.g., Grover-type search algorithm, and a distilled probability-magnitude in a value-based decision-making domain, e.g., adversarial multi-armed bandit algorithm. The proposed algorithm is generalized, via the devised mapping, for better learning weight adjustments on favorable/unfavorable actions, and its effectiveness is verified via simulation.

TI Koopman wavefunctions and Clebsch variables in Vlasov-Maxwell kinetic
   theory
SO JOURNAL OF PLASMA PHYSICS
AB Motivated by recent discussions on the possible role of quantum computation in plasma simulations, here, we present different approaches to Koopman's Hilbert-space formulation of classical mechanics in the context of Vlasov-Maxwell kinetic theory. The celebrated Koopman-von Neumann construction is provided with two different Hamiltonian structures: one is canonical and recovers the usual Clebsch representation of the Vlasov density, the other is non-canonical and appears to overcome certain issues emerging in the canonical formalism. Furthermore, the canonical structure is restored for a variant of the Koopman-von Neumann construction that carries a different phase dynamics. Going back to van Hove's prequantum theory, the corresponding Koopman-van Hove equation provides an alternative Clebsch representation which is then coupled to the electromagnetic fields. Finally, the role of gauge transformations in the new context is discussed in detail.

TI Clifford group is not a semidirect product in dimensions N divisible by

SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICS A-MATHEMATICAL AND THEORETICAL
AB The paper is devoted to projective Clifford groups of quantum N-dimensional systems (with configuration space Z(N)). Clearly, Clifford gates allow only the simplest quantum computations which can be simulated on a classical co puter (Gottesmann-Knill theorem). However, it may serve as a cornerstone of full quantum computation. As to its group structure it is well-known that-in N-dimensional quantum mechanics-the Clifford group is a natural semidirect product provided the dimension N is an odd number. For even N special re ults on the Clifford groups are scattered in the mathematical literature, but they mostly do not concern the semidirect structure. Using appropriate group presentation of SL(2, ZN) it is proved that for even N the projective Clifford groups are not natural semidirect products if and only if N is divisible by four.

As the existence of large qRAM is questionable, Benedikt et al. leave an open question on building low-qRAM quantum herding attacks.
   In this paper, we answer this open question by building a quantum herding attack, where the time complexity is slightly increased from Benedikt et al.'s 2(0.43n) to ours 2(0.46n), but it does not need qRAM anymore (abbreviated as no-qRAM). Besides, we also introduce various low-qRAM or no-qRAM quantum attacks on hash concatenation combiner, hash XOR combiner, Hash-Twice, and Zipper hash functions.

TI Dual topological states in the layered titanium-based oxypnictide
   superconductor BaTi2Sb2O
SO NPJ QUANTUM MATERIALS
AB Topological superconductors have long been predicted to host Majorana zero modes which obey non-Abelian statistics and have potential for realizing non-decoherence topological quantum computation. However, material realization of topological superconductors is still a challenge in condensed matter physics. Utilizing high-resolution angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy and first-principles calculations, we predict and then unveil the coexistence of topological Dirac semimetal and topological insulator states in the vicinity of Fermi energy (E-F) in the titanium-based oxypnictide superconductor BaTi2Sb2O. Further spin-resolved measurements confirm its spin-helical surface states around E-F, which are topologically protected and give an opportunity for realization of Majorana zero modes and Majorana flat bands in one material. Hosting dual topological states, the intrinsic superconductor BaTi2Sb2O is expected to be a promising platform for further investigation of topological superconductivity.

TI Experimental anonymous conference key agreement using linear cluster
   states
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Multipartite entanglement enables secure and anonymous key exchange between multiple parties in a network. Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger states have been introduced as resource states for anonymous key exchange protocols, in which an anonymous subset of parties within a larger network establishes a secret key. However, the use of other types of multipartite entanglement for such protocols remains relatively unexplored. Here, we demonstrate that linear cluster states can serve as a versatile and potentially scalable resource in such applications. We implemented an anonymous key exchange protocol with four photons in a linear cluster state and established a shared key between three parties in our network. We show how to optimize the protocol parameters to account for noise and to maximize the finite key rate under realistic conditions. As cluster states have been established as a flexible resource in quantum computation, we expect that our demonstration provides a first step towards their hybrid use for networked computing and communication.

TI Witnesses of coherence and dimension from multiphoton
   indistinguishability tests
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Quantum coherence marks a deviation from classical physics, and has been studied as a resource for metrology and quantum computation. Finding reliable and effective methods for assessing its presence is then highly desirable. Coherence witnesses rely on measuring observables whose outcomes can guarantee that a state is not diagonal in a known reference basis. Here, we experimentally measure a type of coherence witness that uses pairwise state comparisons to identify superpositions in a basis-independent way. Our experiment uses a single interferometric setup to simultaneously measure the three pairwise overlaps among three single-photon states via Hong-Ou-Mandel tests. Aside from coherence witnesses, we show the measurements also serve as a Hilbert-space dimension witness. Our results attest to the effectiveness of pooling many two-state comparison tests to ascertain various relational properties of a set of quantum states.

TI Optimal distributed multi-parameter estimation in noisy environments
SO QUANTUM SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB We consider the task of multiple parameter estimation in the presence of strong correlated noise with a network of distributed sensors. The signals and the noises have different spatial dependence but are encoded with the same local generators. We study how to find and improve noise-insensitive strategies. We show that sequentially probing with GHZ states from the decoherence-free subspace that we identify is asymptotically optimal up to a factor of at most 4 in the limit of many repetitions. The implementation of such strategies only requires local read-out and 'passive' resources-an initially entangled state of the sensors and tunable local interaction strength.

TI Rotating Majorana zero modes in a disk geometry
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
AB We study the manipulation of Majorana zero modes in a thin disk made from a p-wave superconductor, in order to understand their use as a building block for topological quantum computers. We analyze the second-order topological corner modes that arise when an in-plane magnetic field is applied, and we calculate their dynamical evolution when rotating the magnetic field, with special emphasis on nonadiabatic effects. We characterize the phase transition between high-frequency and near-adiabatic evolution using Floquet analysis. We show that oscillations persist even in the adiabatic phase because of a frequency-independent coupling between zero modes and excited states, which we have quantified numerically and analytically. These results show that controlling the rotation frequency can be a simple method to avoid the nonadiabatic errors originated from this coupling and thus increase the robustness of topological quantum computation.

TI Blockchain-Enabled Zero Trust Architecture for Privacy-Preserving
   Cybersecurity in IoT Environments
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB This research introduced a new novel "Unified Quantum-Resilient Blockchain-Zero-Knowledge Proofs Privacy Authentication Framework (QBC-ZKPAF)" to upgrade the IoT environments with greater security. To enable privacy-preserving authentication, access control, and secure communication, the framework integrates blockchain technology with Zero Trust Architecture (ZTA) and post-quantum cryptography. A hybrid Reinforcement-Lattice Blockchain KeyGen for quantum-resilient key generation, Deep Q-Network Multi-Factor Secure Key (DQN-MFSK) for dynamic selection of keys, and Zero-Knowledge Proof for privacy-preserving signatures are employed to achieve secure IoT settings. This architecture entails data privacy and confidentiality, auditability and traceability, and withstanding evolving threats, including potential threats in terms of quantum attacks. It then uses blockchain technology for recording unalterable data of identity and access management while Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKP) ensures authentication and verification without revealing sensitive information. By decentralizing identity management and enabling multi-factor authentication, QBC-ZKPAF provides robust security and privacy solutions for IoT networks. The experimental results demonstrate the model's effectiveness with 98% privacy preservation, 700 TPS throughput, 0.7 J energy consumption, 0.98 quantum resilience, and 96% access control effectiveness, making it highly suitable for modern IoT and blockchain applications.

TI Continuous-Wave Laser Induced Formation of Carbon-Related Defects in
   Hexagonal Boron Nitride Enhanced by Surface Plasmons and Strain
SO ADVANCED FUNCTIONAL MATERIALS
AB Hexagonal boron nitride (hBN), a 2D van der Waals material, has garnered significant attention for its applications in optoelectronic devices and quantum photonics, primarily due to its remarkable stability and wide bandgap. The hetero-integration of graphene within the hBN lattice to form nano-heterostructure and carbon-related emitters is of particular interest due to the engineered bandgap, defect states and magnetic properties. However, achieving such heterostructures remains challenging. In this work, it is demonstrated that continuous-wave laser irradiation of pristine hBN flakes induces the aggregation of carbon atoms, forming graphene fragments that result in carbon-related defect emitters at the hBN/graphene boundaries with excellent repeatability and stability. By capping metal nanoparticles with hBN, it is shown that the synergistic effects of localized surface plasmon resonances and strain effectively lower the irradiation threshold required to achieve these structures, while enhancing and stabilizing fluorescence from defect emitters at the boundaries. Furthermore, selective enhancement of specific wavebands within the broad emission spectrum of carbon-related defects is achieved by nanoparticle-on-mirror nanocavities. This work presents a straightforward and efficient approach to introducing graphene fragments and carbon-related defect emitters in 2D pristine hBN flakes, paving the way for integrated circuitry and on-chip quantum nanophotonic devices.

AB Post-quantum cryptography (PQC) has drawn significant attention from the hardware design research community. In particular, efficient implementation for major components of PQC algorithms like polynomial multiplication has been a hot topic recently. Following this trend, in this paper, we propose a novel hardware-implemented Lightweight Accelerator for the large integer polynomial MultiPlication (LAMP) used in PQC schemes. Specifically, we target the polynomial multiplications not bound by fixed fast algorithms like Number Theoretic Transform (NTT), i.e., Falcon (one of the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) selected PQC algorithms) and Ring Binary Learning-with-Errors based encryption scheme (RBLWE-ENC, a promising lightweight PQC scheme). Overall, we have carried out three layers of innovative efforts. (i) A new lightweight computation strategy for the targeted polynomial multiplication is proposed; (ii) The new accelerator is then designed based on the proposed algorithm (applicable for both targeted schemes); (iii) A thorough evaluation process is carried out to showcase the superior performance of the proposed accelerator over the competing designs, e.g., at least 21.2% less area-delay product (ADP) when LAMP is used for RBLWE-ENC (on Virtex-7 device). The proposed work is efficient and interesting, and we hope this outcome can facilitate PQC development.

TI Counterdiabatic route for preparation of state with long-range
   topological order
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
AB We propose here a counterdiabatic (CD) strategy for the fast preparation of a state with long-range topological order by magnetic field tuning of an initial separable state. For concreteness, we consider the ground state of the honeycomb Kitaev model whose long-range topological order together with the anyonic excitations make it an interesting candidate for fault-tolerant universal quantum computation and storage. We implement an approximate local CD perturbation having the form of the off-diagonal exchange interactions in Kitaev Hamiltonians. The counterdiabatically produced state is found to have a high fidelity (greater than or similar to 0.5) and retains numerous desired entanglement properties while giving a speed-up of the order of 10(6). In our study of up to 24-spin clusters we found the fidelity is constrained by the spectral gap rather than the system size.

TI Readout of Majorana bound states via Landau-Zener transition
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
AB Reading out Majorana bound states (MBSs) is essential both to verify their non-Abelian property and to realize topological quantum computation. Here, we construct a protocol to measure the parity of two MBSs in a Majorana island coupled to a double quantum dot (DQD). The parity information is mapped to the charge state of the DQD through Landau-Zener transition. The operation needed is sweeping the bias of the DQD, which is followed by charge sensing. In the case without fine-tuning, a single run of sweep and detection implements a weak measurement of the parity. We find that in general a sequence of about ten runs would completely project a superposition state to either parity, and the charge detection in each run records how the state of the MBSs collapses step by step. Remarkably, this readout protocol is a nondemolition measurement and robust to low-frequency charge fluctuation.

TI MQTTEEB-D: A Real-World IoT Cybersecurity Dataset for AI-Powered Threat
   Detection in MQTT Networks
SO DATA IN BRIEF
AB In this paper, we introduce the framework and its experimental design, which was used to elaborate the MQTTEEB-D dataset and to execute real-time MQTT-based attacks while collecting traffic data. The MQTTEEB-D dataset is a practical real-world data set for intrusion detection improvement in MQTT-based IoT networks. Unlike already existing datasets, which are constructed using simulated network traffic, MQTTEEB-D is obtained from a real-time IoT testbed, named MQTTEEB. Various cyberattacks, including Denial of Service (DoS), Slow DoS against Internet of Things Environments (SlowITe), Malformed Data Injection, Brute Force, and MQTT publish flooding, were carried out in real-time while allowing close monitoring of network traffic anomalies. Data was gathered using PyShark and organized into multiple CSV files. To ensure high data quality, we performed pre-processing steps, such as outlier removal, normalization, standardization, and class balance. Several processed forms of data (e.g., raw, cleaned, normalized, standardized), along with detailed metadata are also provided for being used, for instance, to develop and validate AI-driven intrusion detection models.

TI A side-channel attack on a masked hardware implementation of
   CRYSTALS-Kyber
SO JOURNAL OF CRYPTOGRAPHIC ENGINEERING
AB NIST has recently selected CRYSTALS-Kyber as a new public key encryption and key establishment algorithm to be standardized. This makes it important to evaluate the resistance of CRYSTALS-Kyber implementations to side-channel attacks. Software implementations of CRYSTALS-Kyber have already been thoroughly analysed. The discovered vulnerabilities have helped improve subsequently released versions and promoted stronger countermeasures against side-channel attacks. In this paper, we present the first attack on a protected hardware implementation of CRYSTALS-Kyber. We demonstrate a practical message (shared key) recovery attack on the first-order masked FPGA implementation of Kyber-512 by Kamucheka et al. (2022) using power analysis based on the Hamming distance leakage model. The presented attack exploits a vulnerability located in the masked message decoding function executed during the decryption step of decapsulation. The message recovery is performed using a profiled deep learning-assisted method which extracts the message directly, without explicitly retrieving each share. By repeating the same decapsulation multiple times, it is possible to increase the success rate of full shared key recovery to 99%. We also analyse the feasibility of recovering shared keys during encapsulation and propose a countermeasure against the presented attack that is also applicable to FPGA implementations of other cryptographic algorithms.

AB Constrained binary optimization aims to find an optimal assignment to minimize or maximize the objective meanwhile satisfying the constraints, which is a representative NP problem in various domains, including transportation, scheduling, and economy. Quantum approximate optimization algorithms (QAOA) provide a promising methodology for solving this problem by exploiting the parallelism of quantum entanglement. However, existing QAOA approaches based on penalty-term or Hamiltonian simulation fail to thoroughly encode the constraints, leading to extremely low success rate and long searching latency.
   This paper proposes Choco-Q, a formal and universal framework for constrained binary optimization problems, which comprehensively covers all constraints and exhibits high deployability for current quantum devices. The main innovation of Choco-Q is to embed the commute Hamiltonian as the driver Hamiltonian, resulting in a much more general encoding formulation that can deal with arbitrary linear constraints. Leveraging the arithmetic features of commute Hamiltonian, we propose three optimization techniques to squeeze the overall circuit complexity, including Hamiltonian serialization, equivalent decomposition, and variable elimination. The serialization mechanism transforms the original Hamiltonian into smaller ones. Our decomposition methods only take linear time complexity, achieving end-to-end acceleration. Experiments demonstrate that Choco-Q shows more than 235x algorithmic improvement in successfully finding the optimal solution, and achieves 4.69x end-to-end acceleration, compared to prior QAOA designs.

TI Unveiling the Fifth Dimension: A Novel Approach to Quantum Mechanics
SO QUANTUM REPORTS
AB Quantum mechanics (QM) has long challenged our understanding of time, space, and reality, with phenomena such as superposition, wave-particle duality, and quantum entanglement defying classical notions of causality and locality. Despite the predictive success of QM, its interpretations-such as the Copenhagen and many-worlds interpretations-remain contentious and incomplete. This paper introduces Strip Theory, a novel framework that reconceptualises time as a two-dimensional manifold comprising foretime, the sequential dimension, and sidetime, an orthogonal possibility dimension representing parallel quantum outcomes. By incorporating sidetime, the theory provides a unified explanation for quantum superposition, coherence, and interference, resolving ambiguities associated with wavefunction collapse. The methods involve extending the mathematical formalism of QM into a five-dimensional framework, where sidetime is explicitly encoded alongside spatial and sequential temporal dimensions. The principal findings demonstrate that this model reproduces all measurable results of QM while addressing foundational issues, offering a clearer and more deterministic interpretation of quantum phenomena. Furthermore, the framework provides insights into quantum coherence, wave-particle duality, and the philosophical implications of free will. These results suggest that Strip Theory can serve as a bridge between interpretations and provide a deeper understanding of time and reality, advancing both theoretical and conceptual horizons.

TI Symmetry-Protected Topological Edge Modes and Emergent Partial
   Time-Reversal Symmetry Breaking in Open Quantum Many-Body Systems
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB Symmetry-protected topological edge modes are one of the most remarkable phenomena in topological physics. Here, we formulate and quantitatively examine the effect of a quantum bath on these topological edge modes. Using the density matrix renormalization group method, we study the ground state of a composite system of spin-1 quantum chain, where the system and the bath degrees of freedom are treated on the same footing. We focus on the dependence of these edge modes on the global and partial symmetries of system-bath coupling and on the features of the quantum bath. It is shown that the time-reversal symmetry (TRS) plays a special role for an open quantum system, where an emergent partial TRS breaking will result in a TRS-protected topological mode diffusing from the system edge into the bath, thus make it useless for quantum computation.

TI Breakdown of quantum-classical correspondence and dynamical generation
   of entanglement
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
AB The exchange interaction arising from particle indistinguishability is of central importance in the physics of many-particle quantum systems. Here we study analytically the dynamical generation of quantum entanglement induced by this interaction in an isolated system, namely, an ideal Fermi gas confined in a chaotic cavity, which is described by a non-Gaussian pure state and evolves unitarily from it. We find that the breakdown of the quantum-classical correspondence of particle motion, via the dramatic change in the spatial structure of the many-body wave function, leads to profound changes of the entanglement. Furthermore, for a class of initial states, the changes engender the approach to thermal equilibrium everywhere in the cavity, with the well-known Ehrenfest time in quantum chaos as the thermalization time. Specifically, the quantum expectation values of various correlation functions at different spatial scales are all determined by the Fermi-Dirac distribution. In addition, by using the reduced density matrix (RDM) and the entanglement entropy (EE) as local probes, we find that the gas inside a subsystem is in equilibrium with that outside, and that its thermal entropy is the EE, even though the whole system is in a pure state.

TI Breaking the mirror symmetry of photonic spin-orbit interaction using a
   geometrically symmetric chiral resonator
SO JOURNAL OF OPTICS
AB The symmetries of photonic spin-orbit interaction (PSOI) at waveguide interfaces provide flexible modulation capability but limit their practical implementation due to the stringent requirements of excitation conditions. This limitation can be mitigated by intentionally breaking local symmetries, offering a novel platform for achieving directional coupling and optical isolation with PSOI-based interfaces. For example, breaking the inversion symmetry of a nanofiber PSOI interface using a nanosphere scatterer reduces the required accuracy in the size and position of excitation spots. This study introduces a novel approach to break the mirror symmetry of a PSOI-based nanofiber waveguide by coupling it with a geometrically symmetric chiral gold nanohelicoid (GNH) resonator, which relaxes the original requirement of circularly polarized excitations. Finite-difference time-domain simulations demonstrate unidirectional light coupling and propagation under both circularly and linearly polarized excitations, showcasing the versatility of this hybrid symmetry-broken system. The Fano-like features observed in directionality spectra align with the GNH's circular dichroism spectrum, emphasizing an intricate correlation between plasmonic near-field chirality and far-field scattering dichroism. This work paves the way for enhancing the functionalities of PSOI-based waveguide interfaces through locally coupling them with nanoscale chiral resonators, thereby expanding their application in quantum photonics, information transport and plasmonic nanophotonics.

TI Realistic photon-number resolution in Gaussian boson sampling
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Gaussian boson sampling (GBS) is a model of nonuniversal quantum computation that claims to demonstrate quantum supremacy with current technologies. This model entails sampling photocounting events from a multimode Gaussian state at the outputs of a linear interferometer. In this scheme, collision events-those with more than one photon for each mode-are infrequent. However, they are still used for validation purposes. Therefore, the limitation of realistic detectors to perfectly resolve adjacent photon numbers becomes pivotal. We derive a photocounting probability distribution in GBS schemes which is applicable for use with general detectors and photocounting techniques. This probability distribution is expressed in terms of functionals of the field-quadrature covariance matrix, e.g., Hafnian and Torontonian in the well-known special cases of photon-number-resolving and on-off detectors, respectively. Based on our results, we consider a GBS validation technique involving detectors with realistic photon-number resolution.

TI Coupling organic free-radical molecules to lumped-element
   superconducting resonators
SO LOW TEMPERATURE PHYSICS
AB A promising route toward the realization of a molecular spin quantum processor relies on coupling magnetic molecules to individual photons confined within superconducting resonators. As a simple approximation to such a hybrid scheme, here we explore the conditions that determine the collective coupling of DPPH organic free radicals to lumped-element LC superconducting resonators. In these chips, multiple resonators are coupled to a single readout line. This enables designing the relevant resonator properties, such as resonance frequency, cavity volume, and impedance while keeping a perfect transmission for the device. Here, we exploit these design possibilities to achieve a coherent spin-photon coupling regime. Besides, we study how this coupling depends on the relative orientation of the external dc magnetic field concerning the photon magnetic field and the spins locations concerning the chip surface.

TI Resources for Bosonic Quantum Computational Advantage
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB Quantum computers promise to dramatically outperform their classical counterparts. However, the nonclassical resources enabling such computational advantages are challenging to pinpoint, as it is not a single resource but the subtle interplay of many that can be held responsible for these potential advantages. In this Letter, we show that every bosonic quantum computation can be recast into a continuous-variable sampling computation where all computational resources are contained in the input state. Using this reduction, we derive a general classical algorithm for the strong simulation of bosonic computations, whose complexity scales with the non-Gaussian stellar rank of both the input state and the measurement setup. We further study the conditions for an efficient classical simulation of the associated continuous-variable sampling computations and identify an operational notion of non-Gaussian entanglement based on the lack of passive separability, thus clarifying the interplay of bosonic quantum computational resources such as squeezing, non-Gaussianity, and entanglement.

TI Accurate simulation for finite projected entangled pair states in two
   dimensions
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
AB Based on the scheme of variational Monte Carlo sampling, we develop an accurate and efficient two-dimensional tensor-network algorithm to simulate quantum lattice models. We find that Monte Carlo sampling shows huge advantages in dealing with finite projected entangled pair states, which allows significantly enlarged system size and improves the accuracy of tensor network simulation. We demonstrate our method on the square-lattice antiferromagnetic Heisenberg model up to 32 x 32 sites, as well as a highly frustrated J(1)-J(2) model up to 24 x 24 sites. The results, including ground state energy and spin correlations, are in excellent agreement with those of the available quantum Monte Carlo or density matrix renormalization group methods. Therefore, our method substantially advances the calculation of 2D tensor networks for finite systems, and potentially opens a new door towards resolving many challenging strongly correlated quantum many-body problems.

TI On Transmitted Complexity Based on Modified Compound States
SO ENTROPY
AB Based on the classical dynamical entropy, the channel coding theorem is investigated. Attempts to extend the dynamical entropy to quantum systems have been made by several researchers In 1999, Kossakowski, Ohya and I introduced the quantum dynamical entropy (KOW entropy) for completely positive maps containing an automorphism describing the time evolution. Its formulation used transition expectations and lifting in the sense of Accardi and Ohya and was studied as a measure of the complexity of quantum mechanical systems. This KOW entropy allowed the extension of generalized AF (Alicki and Fannes) entropy and generalized AOW (Accardi, Ohya and Watanabe) entropy. In addition, the S-Mixing entropy and S-mixing mutual-entropy were formulated by Ohya in 1985. Compound states are an important tool for formulating mutual entropy, and the complexity was constructed by the generalized AOW entropy. In this paper, the complexity associated with the entangled compound states in the C* dynamical system based on the generalized AOW entropy based on the KOW entropy is investigated to lay the foundation for the proof of the theorem of channel coding for quantum systems. We show that the fundamental inequalities of the mutual entropy are satisfied when the initial state is transmitted over the channel changes with time.

TI Elimination of zero-field splitting frequency drift of nitrogen vacancy
   center ensembles in diamond induced by temperature noise
SO APPLIED PHYSICS EXPRESS
AB The electron spin state of the NV color center in the diamond is optically polarized and read out by laser. However, laser irradiation introduces additional temperature noise, and the zero-field splitting term in the Hamiltonian becomes unstable. The main objective of this study is to explain and eliminate the influence of temperature noise generated by laser power and to propose a laser pulse shaping for detection. Experimental results show that the additional -2.8 MHz frequency drift introduced by the high-power laser is suppressed, under the condition of achieving the same resonance peak contrast of the high-power laser.

TI Fabrication of hydrothermal PPKTP and its spontaneous parametric
   down-conversion characteristics
SO JOURNAL OF CRYSTAL GROWTH
AB High-voltage electric field polarization, selective corrosion, current monitoring, and other methods are used to develop hydrothermal PPKTP. It is found that the reversal domain nucleation of hydrothermal-grown KTP crystals has four kinds of microscopic morphology, namely, strip shape, spindle shape, bullet shape and irregular shape, in the process of high voltage electric field polarization. Compared with the leakage current in the process of polarization of flux-grown KTP crystals, the hydrothermal-grown KTP crystals only exist when the applied electric field is much larger than the coercive field. The leakage current can be suppressed by multiple loading of short pulses, and the PPKTP with a poled period of 10 mu m and 46 mu m were fabricated, respectively. Subsequently, based on the fabricated PPKTP, the SPDC characteristics are studied. To the PPKTP with a poled period of 10 mu m, the quantum entanglement source whose brightness exceeds 2.1 kHz @ 810 nm is prepared by the SPDC technique. Otherwise, the PPKTP with a poled period of 46 mu m is used for SPDC, and the brightness of entangled photon pairs in channel 1 and channel 2 are 3.21 kHz @ 1560 nm and 5.31 kHz @ 1560 nm, respectively.

TI Forecasting long-time dynamics in quantum many-body systems by dynamic
   mode decomposition
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Reliable numerical computation of quantum dynamics is a fundamental challenge when the long-ranged quantum entanglement plays essential roles as in the cases governed by quantum criticality in strongly correlated systems. Here we apply a method that utilizes reliable short-time data of physical quantities to accurately forecast long-time behavior of the strongly entangled systems. We straightforwardly employ the simple dynamic mode decomposition (DMD), which is commonly used in fluid dynamics. Despite the simplicity of the method, the effectiveness and applicability of the DMD in quantum many-body systems such as the Ising model in the transverse field at the critical point are demonstrated, even when the time evolution at long time exhibits complicated features such as a volume-law entanglement entropy and consequential power-law decays of correlations characteristic of systems with long-ranged quantum entanglements unlike fluid dynamics. The present method, though simple, enables accurate forecasts amazingly at time as long as nearly an order of magnitude longer than that of the short-time training data. Effects of noise on the accuracy of the forecast are also investigated, because they are important especially when dealing with the experimental data. We find that a few percentages of noise do not affect the prediction accuracy destructively.

TI Acoustic spin-controlled orbital rotations in double spiral acoustic
   beams
SO COMMUNICATIONS PHYSICS
AB Similar to optical spin-orbit interactions (SOIs), acoustic SOIs are anticipated to offer fresh perspectives and capabilities for acoustic manipulation beyond conventional scalar degrees of freedom. However, the acoustic extrinsic SOIs caused by particular properties of the medium were seldom explored. Here, the acoustic extrinsic SOI is observed in a double spiral acoustic beam (DSAB), as evidenced by the rotation of the spatial intensity pattern along the propagation axis. The interaction of the acoustic plane wave with the well-designed artificial flat structure generates two non-paraxial focused acoustic vortices (NFAVs) with different spin angular momentums. The coaxial coupling between them leads to acoustic spin-controlled orbital rotation (SOR). Theoretical formulations, supported by numerical simulations and experimental results, are provided to demonstrate the validity of acoustic SOR. Our work provides new perspectives and capabilities for understanding sound processing, and may open an avenue for the development of spin-orbit acoustics.

TI On decompositions and approximations of conjugate partial-symmetric
   tensors
SO CALCOLO
AB Hermitian matrices have played an important role in matrix theory and complex quadratic optimization. The high-order generalization of Hermitian matrices, conjugate partial-symmetric (CPS) tensors, have shown growing interest recently in tensor theory and computation, particularly in application-driven complex polynomial optimization problems. In this paper, we study CPS tensors with a focus on ranks, computing rank-one decompositions and approximations, as well as their applications. We prove constructively that any CPS tensor can be decomposed into a sum of rank-one CPS tensors, which provides an explicit method to compute such rank-one decompositions. Three types of ranks for CPS tensors are defined and shown to be different in general. This leads to the invalidity of the conjugate version of Comon's conjecture. We then study rank-one approximations and matricizations of CPS tensors. By carefully unfolding CPS tensors to Hermitian matrices, rank-one equivalence can be preserved. This enables us to develop new convex optimization models and algorithms to compute best rank-one approximations of CPS tensors. Numerical experiments from data sets in radar wave form design, elasticity tensor, and quantum entanglement are performed to justify the capability of our methods.

AB Wireless trackers have emerged as a crucial technology in minimally invasive medical procedures with their remote localization capabilities. Existing trackers suffer from miniaturization issues and complex designs, which limit their integration into medical devices. We present nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) magnetic sensing, a quantum sensing approach with nT sensitivity for wireless magnetic tracking. NMR magnetic sensing enables millimeter-scale tracking accuracy and versatile miniaturized tracker designs for minimally invasive medical devices in magnetic resonance imaging scanners. As examples, we demonstrate miniature magnetic trackers with submillimeter-scale diameters for guidewires and optic fibers, flexible magnetic trackers for soft devices, and ferrofluidic trackers for shape-morphing devices. With the demonstrated miniaturization and wide range of tracker design possibilities, wireless magnetic tracking with NMR is promising for future minimally invasive medical operations.

TI Room-Temperature Collective Quantum Emission Mediated by Wannier-Mott
   Excitons in CsPbBr3 Nanowires
SO SMALL SCIENCE
AB Room-temperature collective quantum emission (RT-CQE), enabled by many-body interactions and phase-synchronized dipole oscillations, offers a promising path for scalable quantum photonics. Here, superfluorescence (SF) is demonstrated in CsPbBr3 perovskite nanowires (NWs), facilitated by Wannier-Mott excitons with spatially delocalized wavefunctions and strong dipole-dipole interactions. The intrinsic quasi-1D geometry and occasional bundling promote preferential dipole alignment along the NW axis, enabling long-range phase coherence. Key experimental signatures, photon bunching with g 2(0) approximate to 2, femtosecond-scale coherence time (approximate to 88 fs), and ultralow excitation threshold (approximate to 210 nJ-1 cm2), confirm the onset of SF at ambient conditions. Ultrafast spectroscopy reveals bandgap renormalization, state filling, and exciton-phonon coupling, consistent with collective excitonic behavior mediated by delocalized states. Unlike other RT-SF mechanisms based on polarons or electron-hole liquids, the system exploits directional dipole alignment and exciton delocalization in quasi-1D NWs, allowing coherent emission without the need for high excitation densities or complex structural ordering. These findings demonstrate that CsPbBr3 NWs can sustain RT-SF driven by exciton delocalization and directional dipole coupling, providing a new physical platform for coherent light generation under ambient conditions.

AB We have addressed the characteristic distinguishability of coherent states in the temporal domain from a directly modulated quantum well-based gain-switched laser diode. We identify adjustable parameters to generate indistinguishable coherent states from an electrically pumped semiconductor laser using small-signal and large-signal models. The experiment confirms the generation of indistinguishable signal and decoy coherent states as predicted by the numerical simulation. In addition, the potential for indistinguishability has been explored in different types of coherent states.

AB Hyperledger Fabric is a prominent and flexible solution for building permissioned distributed ledger platforms. Access control and identity management relies on a Membership Service Provider (MSP) whose cryptographic interface only handles standard PKI methods for authentication: RSA and ECDSA classical signatures. Also, MSP-issued credentials may use only one signature scheme, tying the credential-related functions to classical single-signature primitives. RSA and ECDSA are vulnerable to quantum attacks, with an ongoing post-quantum standardization process to identify quantum-safe drop-in replacements. In this paper, we propose a redesign of Fabric's credential-management procedures and related specifications in order to incorporate hybrid digital signatures, protecting against both classical and quantum attacks using one classical and one quantum-safe signature. We create PQFabric, an implementation of Fabric with hybrid signatures that integrates with the Open Quantum Safe (OQS) library. Our implementation offers complete crypto-agility, with the ability to perform live migration to a hybrid quantum-safe blockchain and select any existing OQS signature algorithm for each node. We perform comparative benchmarks of PQFabric with each of the NIST candidates and alternates, revealing that long public keys and signatures lead to an increase in hashing time that is sometimes comparable to the time spent signing or verifying messages itself. This is a new and potentially significant issue in the migration of blockchains to post-quantum signatures.

TI A novel quantum multiparty summation protocol based on a cooperative
   random number mechanism
SO EPJ QUANTUM TECHNOLOGY
AB As a particular area of quantum security multiparty computation, quantum secure multiparty summation plays a critical role in modern cryptography. It is widely known that most of the existing quantum summation protocols are based on an honest or semi-honest third party (TP). However, the introduced TP makes the protocol difficult to implement in practice, as it may face a single-point-of-failure attack on TP. Although some TP-free protocols are proposed to mitigate this risk, the increased cost of communication reduces its efficiency. To address these issues, a novel quantum-secure multiparty summation protocol based on a cooperative random number distribution mechanism (QMS-CRM) is proposed in this paper for the first time. During it, this mechanism is designed using Shamir's secret sharing scheme. Furthermore, this approach eliminates the requirement for random number exchange between participants without the help of TP, enhancing the efficiency of the protocol. The security analysis demonstrates that the proposed protocol can resist both external attacks and collusion attacks by up to n-2\documentclass[12pt]{minimal} \usepackage{amsmath} \usepackage{wasysym} \usepackage{amsfonts} \usepackage{amssymb} \usepackage{amsbsy} \usepackage{mathrsfs} \usepackage{upgreek} \setlength{\oddsidemargin}{-69pt} \begin{document}$n - 2$\end{document} participants. Finally, we simulated the protocol on the IBM Quantum Cloud platform, confirming its feasibility.

TI Post-Quantum Blockchain-Based Decentralized Identity Management for
   Resource Sharing in Open Radio Access Networks
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GREEN COMMUNICATIONS AND NETWORKING
AB Blockchain Network (BCN)-based Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI) has recently surfaced as an identity and access management framework that allows users and organizations to control over their data. On the other hand, Open Radio Access Networks (O-RANs) propose a framework for facilitating the exchange of infrastructure-related data. This study presents the critical role of BCN-SSI in the O-RAN system architecture and promises an authentication process to provide insights into the robust security measures used to seamlessly establish the identification of users and entities within the O-RAN ecosystem in the post-quantum era. We show that the integration of BCN-SSI enhances security protocols and ensures the integrity of communication networks in the evolving technological landscape. As an illustrative use case, spectrum sharing, is also presented to demonstrate the practicality and the impact of the proposed framework. Furthermore, we address the potential threats posed by quantum attacks on BCN-based SSI systems by investigating Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC). Simulation results confirm the effectiveness of the proposed BCN-based DIM and highlight its role in securing identity management processes within the O-RAN context. Finally, we address the use of efficient computational techniques in the context of PQC, which holds significant potential in terms of reducing energy consumption overall.

AB Despite Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC) algorithms exhibiting high security against computational attacks from both quantum and classical computers, they may still be vulnerable to physical attacks due to hardware/software implementation vulnerabilities. Therefore, resilience assessment of PQC designs against physical attacks, such as power Side-Channel Analysis (SCA) attacks, is crucial to provide designers with useful hints to improve the security of their PQC designs. In this paper, we propose an RTL flow for the resilience assessment against power SCA attacks of an RTL design that implements a hardware accelerator for the Keccak-f[1600], a SHA-3-based PQC hash function. The proposed RTL flow consists of EDA tools for power traces collection and a model that considers the resolution, the sampling frequency and the error of the adversary's measurements. For the resilience assessment against power SCA attacks, the guessing entropy metric is obtained by performing Deep Learning (DL) SCA on power traces of SHA3-based algorithms. We present resilience results obtained by the proposed flow, when applied to the Keccak- f[1600] RTL design, and we identify characteristics of attack scenarios, such as adversary's measurements resolution, sampling rate and error, making PQC designs more vulnerable and prone to power SCA attacks.

TI Group signatures and more from isogenies and lattices: generic, simple,
   and efficient
SO DESIGNS CODES AND CRYPTOGRAPHY
AB We construct an efficient dynamic group signature (or more generally an accountable ring signature) from isogeny and lattice assumptions. Our group signature is based on a simple generic construction that can be instantiated by cryptographically hard group actions such as the CSIDH group action or an MLWE-based group action. The signature is of size O(log N), where N is the number of users in the group. Our idea builds on the recent efficient OR-proof by Beullens, Katsumata, and Pintore (Asiacrypt'20), where we efficiently add a proof of valid ciphertext to their OR-proof and further show that the resulting non-interactive zero-knowledge proof system is online extractable. Our group signatures satisfy more ideal security properties compared to previously known constructions, while simultaneously having an attractive signature size. The signature size of our isogeny-based construction is an order of magnitude smaller than all previously known post-quantum group signatures (e.g., 6.6 KB for 64 members). In comparison, our lattice-based construction has a larger signature size (e.g., either 126 KB or 89 KB for 64 members depending on the satisfied security property). However, since the O(middot)-notation hides a very small constant factor, it remains small even for very large group sizes, say 2(20).

TI On the Concrete Security of LWE With Small Secret
SO MATEMATICA
AB Lattice-based cryptography is currently under consideration for standardization in the ongoing NIST PQC Post-Quantum Cryptography competition, and is used as the basis for Homomorphic Encryption schemes world-wide. Both applications rely specifically on the hardness of the Learning With Errors (LWE) problem. Most Homomorphic Encryption deployments use small secrets as an optimization, so it is important to understand the concrete security of LWE when sampling the secret from a non-uniform, small distribution. Although there are numerous heuristics used to estimate the running time and quality of lattice reduction algorithms such as BKZ2.0, more work is needed to validate and test these heuristics in practice to provide concrete security parameter recommendations, especially in the case of small secret. In this work, we introduce a new approach which uses concrete attacks on the LWE problem as a way to study the performance and quality of BKZ2.0 directly. We find that the security levels for certain values of the modulus q and dimension n are smaller than predicted by the online Lattice Estimator, due to the fact that the attacks succeed on these uSVP lattices for blocksizes which are smaller than expected based on current estimates. We also find that many instances of the TU Darmstadt LWE challenges can be solved significantly faster when the secret is chosen from the binary or ternary distributions.

TI Tunable on-chip optical traps for levitating particles based on
   single-layer metasurface
SO NANOPHOTONICS
AB Optically levitated multiple nanoparticles have emerged as a platform for studying complex fundamental physics such as non-equilibrium phenomena, quantum entanglement, and light-matter interaction, which could be applied for sensing weak forces and torques with high sensitivity and accuracy. An optical trapping landscape of increased complexity is needed to engineer the interaction between levitated particles beyond the single harmonic trap. However, existing platforms based on spatial light modulators for studying interactions between levitated particles suffered from low efficiency, instability at focal points, the complexity of optical systems, and the scalability for sensing applications. Here, we experimentally demonstrated that a metasurface which forms two diffraction-limited focal points with a high numerical aperture (similar to 0.9) and high efficiency (31 %) can generate tunable optical potential wells without any intensity fluctuations. A bistable potential and double potential wells were observed in the experiment by varying the focal points' distance, and two nanoparticles were levitated in double potential wells for hours, which could be used for investigating the levitated particles' nonlinear dynamics, thermal dynamics and optical binding. This would pave the way for scaling the number of levitated optomechanical devices or realizing paralleled levitated sensors.

TI Efficient quantum secure direct communication scheme based on single
   photons
SO ACTA PHYSICA SINICA
AB In this work, we first introduce the specific steps of a quantum-secure direct communication scheme that sends a single photon at a time. Based on the basic steps of the scheme, it is gradually extended to a quantum secure direct communication scheme that transmits single-photon sequences twice and four times, with emphasis on the coding rules corresponding to each scheme. The purpose is that through the above scheme, it can be intuitively seen in the subsequent efficiency analysis that with the increase of the number of transmissions, the classification of single photons can be increased, and the encoding capacity of each single photon and the transmission efficiency of quantum states in the entire communication can be greatly improved. Finally, a universal scheme and coding rules for quantum secure direct communication by sending single photons in an integer power of 2 are proposed, and after security analysis the scheme proves to be safe and feasible. Through the efficiency analysis, the communication efficiency of this scheme is higher than that of the existing scheme, and the implementation of this scheme only uses a single photon, does not involve with quantum entanglement, and this scheme has more application values.

TI Topological Corner Modes by Composite Wannier States in Glide-Symmetric
   Photonic Crystal
SO LASER & PHOTONICS REVIEWS
AB Second-order topological insulators can be characterized by their bulk polarization, which is believed to be intrinsically connected to the center of the Wannier function. In this study, the existence of second-order topological insulators is demonstrated that feature a pair of partially degenerate photonic bands. These arise from the nonsymmorphic glide symmetry in an all-dielectric photonic crystal. The center of the maximally localized Wannier function (MLWF) is consistently located at the origin but is not equivalent with respect to the sum of constituent polarizations. As a result, topological corner modes can be identified by the distinctly hybridized MLWFs that truncate at the sample boundary. Through full-wave numerical simulations paired with microwave experiments, the second-order topology is clearly confirmed and characterized. These topological corner states exhibit notably unique modal symmetries, which are made possible by the inversion of the Wannier bands. These results provide an alternative approach to explore higher-order topological physics with significant potential for applications in integrated and quantum photonics.
   For entangled bands induced by nonsymmorphic glide symmetry, the scheme by exploring the hybridization pattern of the maximally localized Wannier function, i.e., the Wannier band-resolved polarization components, serves as a finer second-order topological identifications and classifications that captures the observable and distinct corner states that arise from the domain interface. image

TI Optimizing Crystals-Dilithium implementation in 16-bit MSP430
   environment utilizing hardware multiplier
SO ICT EXPRESS
AB Dilithium was selected as one of NIST standard Post Quantum Digital Signature algorithms and is undergoing standardization as a Module Lattice Digital Signature Algorithm (ML-DSA). However, until now research on optimization in embedded environments has primarily been conducted on ARM architectures, which are the basic benchmark targets. To prepare for future quantum secure Internet of Things environments, performance optimization on resource-constrained must be considered. Thus, in this paper, for the first time, we propose an optimized implementation of Dilithium in the 16-bit MSP430 environment, a low-resource device. We redesign the state-of-the-art optimization strategies for Dilithium to suit the MSP430 environment. By taking full advantage of MSP430's hardware multiplier in the NTT-based polynomial multiplication, we achieve 73.0% and 80.1% of performance improvement for NTT and NTT-1 compared to those in the reference implementation, which contributes about 5.5%-7.0%, 15.3%-17.5%, and 7.5%-10.0% of performance improvement compared to Dilithium's public reference implementation for keypair generation, signing, and verification, respectively.

TI Efficient high-charge Laguerre-Gaussian mode conversion by using a
   periscopic axicon mirror
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB Laguerre-Gaussian (LG) modes can be converted from fundamental Gaussian mode by using phase optical elements such as spiral phase plates (SPP), but the conversion efficiency is strongly reduced in high charge plates because of the transverse intensity deviation. In this paper, a three-step scheme is proposed to dramatically improve the conversion efficiency. First, a fundamental Gaussian beam is converted to a 1st-order LG beam via a 1st-order SPP and a spatial filtering system. Then, by using a periscopic axicon mirror (PAM), the 1st-order LG beam is transformed into an annular beam with larger beam radius. Finally, by using a second high-order SPP, this intensity-matched ring beam can be effectively converted to a high-charge LG(0l) beam. Through optimization of the PAM's parameter, the total conversion efficiency from fundamental Gaussian beam to LG(0l) mode as high as 91.85% is obtained, which is much higher than the case without PAM. Numerical simulations are carried out by the particle-in-cell (PIC) code EPOCH to verify the effectiveness of the scheme.

TI Measuring Nonlocal Brane Order with Error-Corrected Quantum Gas
   Microscopes
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW X
AB Exotic quantum many-body states, such as Haldane and spin liquid phases, can exhibit remarkable features like fractional excitations and non-Abelian statistics and offer new understandings of quantum entanglement in many-body quantum systems. These phases are classified by nonlocal correlators that can be directly measured in atomic analog quantum simulating platforms, such as optical lattices and Rydberg atom arrays. However, characterizing these phases in large systems is experimentally challenging because they are sensitive to local errors like atom loss, which suppress its signals exponentially. Additionally, protocols for systematically identifying and mitigating uncorrelated errors in analog quantum simulators are lacking. Here, we address these challenges by developing an error-correction method for large-scale neutral atom quantum simulators using optical lattices. Our error-correction method can distinguish correlated particle-hole pairs from uncorrelated holes in the Mott insulator. After removing the uncorrelated errors, we observe a dramatic improvement in the nonlocal parity correlator and find the perimeter scaling law. Furthermore, the error model provides a statistical estimation of fluctuations in site occupation, from which we measure the generalized brane correlator and confirm that it can be an order parameter for Mott insulators in two dimensions. Our work provides a promising avenue for investigating and characterizing exotic phases of matters in large-scale quantum simulators.

TI Low-power microstructured atomic oven for alkaline-earth-like elements
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW APPLIED
AB Alkaline-earth-like elements play pivotal roles in advanced quantum sensing technologies, notably optical clocks, with unprecedented precision achieved in recent years. Despite remarkable progress, current optical-lattice clocks still face challenges in meeting the demanding size, weight, and power consumption constraints essential for space applications. Conventional atom sources, such as ovens or dispensers, require substantial heating power, which makes up a significant fraction of the overall power consumption of the system. Addressing this challenge, we present a microstructured atomic oven based on fused silica, designed for miniaturization and low-power operation. We characterize the oven by loading a magneto-optical trap with Yb evaporated from the oven and demonstrate operation with a loading rate above 108 atoms/s for heating powers below 250 mW.

SO APPLIED PHYSICS EXPRESS
AB We describe a local fluctuating magnetic field detection of Fe3O4 superparamagnetic core-shell particles via relaxometry of an ensemble of NV centers in a diamond. A thin diamond chip enables optical access to the contact position of the magnetic particle through the backside. A significant drop in NV relaxation time near the particle was observed and was evaluated using a model incorporating ensemble NVs and magnetic particles. Additionally, the local magnetization curve (B-H curve) was measured by analyzing ODMR frequency splitting under external magnetic fields aligned with an NV axis. This study expands the NV sensing to applications involving collective superparamagnetic particles.

TI Cavity-enhanced zero-phonon emission from an ensemble of G centers in a
   silicon-on-insulator microring
SO APPLIED PHYSICS LETTERS
AB We report the incorporation of an ensemble of G centers in silicon-on-insulator (SOI) microrings using ion implantation and conventional nanofabrication. The coupling between the emitters and the resonant modes of the microrings is studied using continuous-wave and time-resolved microphotoluminescence (PL) experiments. We observe the resonant modes of the microrings on PL spectra, on the wide spectral range that is covered by G center emission. By finely tuning the size of the microrings, we match their zero-phonon line at 1278 nm with a resonant mode of quality factor around 3000 and volume 7.2 (lambda/n)(3). The zero-phonon line intensity is enhanced by a factor of 5, both in continuous-wave and time-resolved measurements. This is attributed to the Purcell enhancement of zero-phonon spontaneous emission into the resonant mode and quantitatively understood considering the distribution of the G center dipoles. Despite the enhancement of the zero-phonon emission, we do not observe any sizeable decrease in the average lifetime of the G centers, which points at a low radiative yield (< 10%). We reveal the detrimental impact of parasitic defects in heavily implanted silicon and discuss the perspectives for quantum electrodynamics experiments with individual color centers in lightly implanted SOI rings. Our results provide key information for the development of deterministic single-photon sources for integrated quantum photonics.

TI Efficient simulation of ultrafast quantum nonlinear optics with matrix
   product states
SO OPTICA
AB Ultrashort pulses propagating in nonlinear nanophotonic waveguides can simultaneously leverage both temporal and spatial field confinement, promising a route towards single-photon nonlinearities in an all-photonic platform. In this multimode quantum regime, however, faithful numerical simulations of pulse dynamics naively require a representation of the state in an exponentially large Hilbert space. Here, we employ a time-domain, matrix product state (MPS) representation to enable efficient simulations by exploiting the entanglement structure of the system. To extract physical insight from these simulations, we develop an algorithm to unravel the MPS quantum state into constituent temporal supermodes, enabling, e.g., access to the phase-space portraits of arbitrary pulse waveforms. As a demonstration, we perform exact numerical simulations of a Kerr soliton in the quantum regime. We observe the development of non-classical Wigner-function negativity in the solitonic mode as well as quantum corrections to the semiclassical dynamics of the pulse. A similar analysis of chi((2)) Si m ultons reveals a unique entanglement structure between the fundamental and second harmonics. Our approach is also readily compatible with quantum trajectory theory, allowing full quantum treatment of propagation loss and decoherence. We expect this work to establish the MPS technique as part of a unified engineering framework for the emerging field of broadband quantum photonics.

This article presents a generalized approach and outlines a deterministic algorithm making possible the implementation of this theoretical concept on scalable fault-tolerant qubit-based quantum computers. We prove that the diagonal unitary operations employed in our algorithm exhibit a polynomial-time complexity of degree two, contrasting with the previously reported exponential complexity of general diagonal unitaries.

TI Quantum Mechanics in a Time-Asymmetric Universe: On the Nature of the
   Initial Quantum State
SO BRITISH JOURNAL FOR THE PHILOSOPHY OF SCIENCE
AB In a quantum universe with a strong arrow of time, we postulate a low-entropy boundary condition (the past hypothesis, PH) to account for the temporal asymmetry. In this article, I show that the PH also contains enough information to simplify the quantum ontology and define a natural initial condition. First, I introduce 'density-matrix realism', the thesis that the quantum state of the universe is objective and impure. This stands in sharp contrast to wave-function realism, the thesis that the quantum state of the universe is objective and pure. Second, I suggest that the PH is sufficient to determine a natural density matrix, which is simple and unique. This is achieved by what I call the 'initial projection hypothesis': the initial density matrix of the universe is the (normalized) projection onto the PH-subspace (in the Hilbert space). Third, because the initial quantum state is unique and simple, we have a strong case for the nomological thesis: the initial quantum state of the universe is on a par with laws of nature. This new package of ideas has several interesting implications, including on the harmony between statistical mechanics and quantum mechanics, theoretical unity of the universe and the subsystems, and the alleged conflict between Humean supervenience and quantum entanglement.

TI Hybrid protocols for multi-party semiquantum private comparison,
   multiplication and summation without a pre-shared key based on
   d-dimensional single-particle states
SO EPJ QUANTUM TECHNOLOGY
AB In this paper, by utilizing d-dimensional single-particle states, three semiquantum cryptography protocols, i.e., the multi-party semiquantum private comparison (MSQPC) protocol, the multi-party semiquantum multiplication (MSQM) protocol and the multi-party semiquantum summation (MSQS) protocol, can be achieved simultaneously under the assistance of two semi-honest quantum third parties (TPs). Here, the proposed MSQPC scheme is the only protocol which is devoted to judging the size relationship of secret integers from more than two semiquantum participants without a pre-shared key. And the proposed MSQM protocol absorbs the innovative concept of semiquantumness into quantum multiplication for the first time, which can calculate the modulo d multiplication of private inputs from more than two semiquantum users. As for the proposed MSQS protocol, it is the only semiquantum summation protocol which aims to accomplish the modulo d addition of more than three semiquantum users' private integers. Neither quantum entanglement swapping nor unitary operations are necessary in the three proposed protocols. The security analysis verifies in detail that both the external attacks and the internal attacks can be resisted in the three proposed protocols.

TI Quantum entangled fractional topology and curvatures
SO COMMUNICATIONS PHYSICS
AB Topological spaces have numerous applications for quantum matter with protected chiral edge modes related to an integer-valued Chern number, which also characterizes the global response of a spin-1/2 particle to a magnetic field. Such spin-1/2 models can also describe topological Bloch bands in lattice Hamiltonians. Here we introduce interactions in a system of spin-1/2s to reveal a class of topological states with rational-valued Chern numbers for each spin providing a geometrical and physical interpretation related to curvatures and quantum entanglement. We study a driving protocol in time to reveal the stability of the fractional topological numbers towards various forms of interactions in the adiabatic limit. We elucidate a correspondence of a one-half topological spin response in bilayer semimetals on a honeycomb lattice with a nodal ring at one Dirac point and a robust pi Berry phase at the other Dirac point.
   The Chern number is a defining characteristic of a non-trivial topological system and is derived from another fundamental property termed the Berry curvature. Here, the authors theoretically propose the concept of fractional topology with a fractional Chern number using interacting spins on a Poincare (Bloch) sphere under an applied magnetic field.

TI Vector finite fields of characteristic two as algebraic support of
   multivariate cryptography
SO COMPUTER SCIENCE JOURNAL OF MOLDOVA
AB The central issue of the development of the multivariate public key algorithms is the design of reversible non-linear mappings of n -dimensional vectors over a finite field, which can be represented in a form of a set of power polynomials. For the first time, finite fields GF ((2(d))(m)) of characteristic two, represented in the form of m -dimensional finite algebras over the fields GF (2(d)) are introduced for implementing the said mappings as exponentiation operation. This technique allows one to eliminate the use of masking linear mappings, usually used in the known approaches to the design of multivariate cryptography algorithms and causthe fields GF ((2(d))(m)) as algebraic support of non-linear mappings ing the sufficiently large size of the public key. The issues of using are considered, including selection of appropriate values of m and d. In the proposed approach to development of the multivariate cryptography algorithms, a superposition of two non-linear mappings is used to define resultant hard -to -reverse mapping with a secret trap door. The used two non-linear mappings provide mutual masking of the corresponding reverse maps, due to which the size of the public key significantly reduces as compared with the known algorithms -analogues at a given security level.

TI A MULTIVARIATE IDENTITY-BASED BROADCAST ENCRYPTION WITH APPLICATIONS TO
   THE INTERNET OF THINGS
SO ADVANCES IN MATHEMATICS OF COMMUNICATIONS
AB When Kevin Ashton proposed the catchword 'Internet of Things' in 1999, little did he know that technology will become an indispensable part of human lives in just two decades. In short, the Internet of Things (IoT), is a catch-all terminology used to describe devices connected to the internet. These devices can share and receive data as well as provide instructions over a network. By design itself, the IoT system requires multicasting data and information to a set of designated devices, securely. Taking everything into account, Broadcast Encryption (BE) seems to be the natural choice to address the problem. BE allows an originator to broadcast ciphertexts to a big group of receivers in a well-organized and competent way, while ensuring that only designated people can decrypt the data. In this work, we put forward the first Identity-Based Broadcast Encryption scheme based on multivariate polynomi-als that achieves post-quantum security. Multivariate public key cryptosystems (MPKC), touted as one of the most promising post-quantum cryptography can-didates, forms the foundation on which our scheme relies upon, which allows it to be very cost-effective and faster when implemented. In addition, it also provides resistance to collusion attack, and as a consequence our scheme can be utilized to form an efficient and robust IoT system.

TI Identification of Hexagonal Boron Nitride Thickness on
   SiO2/Si Substrates by Colorimetry and Contrast
SO APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL
AB Hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) is a layered material with a wide variety of excellent properties for emergent applications in quantum photonics using atomically thin materials. For example, it hosts single-photon emitters that operate up to room-temperature, it can be exploited for atomically flat tunnel barriers, and it can be used to form high finesse photonic nanocavities. Moreover, it is an ideal encapsulating dielectric for two-dimensional (2D) materials and heterostructures, with highly beneficial effects on their electronic and optical properties. Depending on the use case, the thickness of hBN is a critical parameter and needs to be carefully controlled from the monolayer to hundreds of layers. This calls for quick and non-invasive methods to unambiguously identify the thickness of exfoliated flakes. Here, we show that the apparent color of hBN flakes on different SiO2/Si substrates can be made to be highly indicative of the flake thickness, providing a simple method to infer the hBN thickness. Using experimental determination of the colour of hBN flakes and calculating the optical contrast, we derived the optimal substrates for the most reliable hBN thickness identification for flakes with thickness ranging from a few layers towards bulk-like hBN. Our results offer a practical guide for the determination of hBN flake thickness for widespread applications using 2D materials and heterostructures.

TI Deep quantum graph dreaming: deciphering neural network insights into
   quantum experiments
SO MACHINE LEARNING-SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB Despite their promise to facilitate new scientific discoveries, the opaqueness of neural networks presents a challenge in interpreting the logic behind their findings. Here, we use a eXplainable-AI technique called inception or deep dreaming, which has been invented in machine learning for computer vision. We use this technique to explore what neural networks learn about quantum optics experiments. Our story begins by training deep neural networks on the properties of quantum systems. Once trained, we 'invert' the neural network-effectively asking how it imagines a quantum system with a specific property, and how it would continuously modify the quantum system to change a property. We find that the network can shift the initial distribution of properties of the quantum system, and we can conceptualize the learned strategies of the neural network. Interestingly, we find that, in the first layers, the neural network identifies simple properties, while in the deeper ones, it can identify complex quantum structures and even quantum entanglement. This is in reminiscence of long-understood properties known in computer vision, which we now identify in a complex natural science task. Our approach could be useful in a more interpretable way to develop new advanced AI-based scientific discovery techniques in quantum physics.

TI Exciton Collimation, Focusing and Trapping Using Complex Transition
   Metal Dichalcogenide Lateral Heterojunctions
SO ADVANCED OPTICAL MATERIALS
AB Controlling the motion of neutral excitons in optically active media is a mandatory development to enable the conception of advanced circuits and devices for applications in excitronics, quantum photonics, and optoelectronics. Recently, proof of unidirectional exciton transport from high- to low-bandgap material is evidenced using a high-quality lateral heterostructure separating transition metal dichalcogenide monolayers (TMD-MLs). In this paper, by combining room-temperature micro-photoluminescence far-field imaging with a statistical description of exciton transport, the underlying excitonic local distribution and fluxes taking place near lateral heterojunctions are unveiled. The complex 2D excitonic transport properties found near a linear interface separating WSe2 from MoSe2 TMD-MLs are studied and reveal two distinct diffusion regimes profoundly affecting the effective diffusion length. Then, it is shown that combining two and three of these interfaces, allows advanced in-plane control of the excitonic distribution and flux over large distances. Exciton focalization and trapping, allowing an increase in the local exciton density up to three orders of magnitude are demonstrated. Finally, flux collimation is achieved with the formation of parallel current lines extending a few micrometers away from the source. We believe that the deterministic shaping and positioning of the exciton distribution and flux shown here will be key toward the conception of realistic excitronic devices.

TI Noise properties in the Coulomb blockade region of FinFETs
SO JAPANESE JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYSICS
AB Fin FETs (FinFETs) are a promising candidate for the platform of Si quantum computers. The noise properties of commercial FinFETs were experimentally investigated at temperatures below 10 K. The drain current showed Coulomb oscillation, indicating that the FinFET channel became a single quantum dot. Moreover, the noise in the drain current was analyzed, and the basic properties of commercial FinFETs in the low-temperature region were discussed.

TI Quasiperiodic Floquet-Thouless Energy Pump
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB We study a disordered one-dimensional fermionic system subject to quasiperiodic driving by two modes with incommensurate frequencies. We show that the system supports a topological phase in which energy is transferred between the two driving modes at a quantized rate. The phase is protected by a combination of disorder-induced spatial localization and frequency localization, a mechanism unique to quasiperiodically driven systems. We demonstrate that an analogue of the phase can be realized in a cavity-qubit system driven by two incommensurate modes.

TI Dark counts in optical superconducting transition-edge sensors for
   rare-event searches
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW APPLIED
AB Superconducting transition-edge sensors (TESs) are a type of quantum sensor known for their high single-photon detection efficiency and low background. This makes TESs ideal for particle-physics experiments searching for rare events. In this work, we present a comprehensive characterization of the background in optical TESs, distinguishing three types of events: electrical-noise, high-energy, and photonlike events. We introduce computational methods to automate the classification of events. We experimentally verify and simulate the source of the high-energy events. We also isolate the photonlike events, the expected signal in dielectric haloscopes searching for dark-matter dark photons, and achieve a photonlike dark-count rate of 3.6x10-4 - 4 in the 0.8-3.2 eV energy range.

TI Bell's Inequalities and Entanglement in Corpora of Italian Language
SO ENTROPY
AB We analyse the results of three information retrieval tests on conceptual combinations that we have recently performed using corpora of Italian language. Each test has the form of a 'Bell-type test' and was aimed at identifying 'quantum entanglement' in the combination, or composition, of two concepts. In the first two tests, we studied the Italian translation of the combination The Animal Acts, while in the third test, we studied the Italian translation of the combination The Animal eats the Food. We found a significant violation of Bell's inequalities in all tests. Empirical patterns confirm the results obtained with corpora of English language, which indicates the existence of deep structures in concept formation that are language independent. The systematic violation of Bell's inequalities suggests the presence of entanglement, and indeed, we elaborate here a 'quantum model in Hilbert space' for the collected data. This investigation supports our theoretical hypothesis about entanglement as a phenomenon of 'contextual updating', independent of the nature, micro-physical or conceptual-linguistic, of the entities involved. Finally, these findings allow us to further clarify the mutual relationships between entanglement, Cirel'son's bound, and no-signalling in Bell-type situations.

TI Quantum optimal control of squeezing in cavity optomechanics
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Squeezing is a nonclassical feature of quantum states that is a useful resource, for example, in quantum sensing of mechanical forces. Here, we show how to use optimal control theory to maximize squeezing in an optomechanical setup with two external drives and determine how fast the mechanical mode can be squeezed. For the autonomous drives considered here, we find the inverse cavity decay to lower-bound the protocol duration. At and above this limit, we identify a family of protocols leveraging a two-stage control strategy, where the mechanical mode is cooled before it is squeezed. Identification of the control strategy allows for two important insights: to determine the factors that limit squeezing and to simplify the time dependence of the external drives, making our protocol readily applicable in experiments.

TI Quantum gravity gradiometry for future mass change science
SO EPJ QUANTUM TECHNOLOGY
AB A quantum gravity gradiometer in a low Earth orbit, operating in a cross-track configuration, could be a viable single-spacecraft measurement instrument to provide mass change data for Earth observation, at comparable or better resolutions to existing maps generated by GRACE-FO. To reach the sensitivity for these science-grade measurements, many parts of the cold-atom interferometer need to be operating at, or beyond, state-of-the-art performance. In order to raise the maturity of the technology of the cold-atom gradiometer and determine the feasibility of a science-grade instrument, a pathfinder technology demonstration platform is funded. The requirements and a notional design for such a pathfinder and the outstanding challenges for science-grade instruments are presented.

TI Studying Quantum Materials with Scanning SQUID Microscopy
SO ANNUAL REVIEW OF CONDENSED MATTER PHYSICS
AB Electronic correlations give rise to fascinating macroscopic phenomena such as superconductivity, magnetism, and topological phases of matter. Although these phenomena manifest themselves macroscopically, fully understanding the underlying microscopic mechanisms often requires probing on multiple length scales. Spatial modulations on the mesoscopic scale are especially challenging to probe, owing to the limited range of suitable experimental techniques. Here, we review recent progress in scanning superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID) microscopy. We demonstrate how scanning SQUID combines unmatched magnetic field sensitivity and highly versatile designs, by surveying discoveries in unconventional superconductivity, exotic magnetism, topological states, and more. Finally, we discuss how SQUID microscopy can be further developed to answer the increasing demand for imaging new quantum materials.

TI Numerical investigations on CdTe-based rectangular photonic waveguides
SO PHYSICS OPEN
AB Cadmium telluride (CdTe)-based photonic waveguides featuring an H-bend have been designed and computed in detail by COMSOL Multiphysics at an operating wavelength of 1.55 mu m. The structure includes CdTe as the core material, SiO2 as the cladding, and ZnO as the substrate. The overall dimension of the waveguide is (4 x 3) mu m where the core width and height are 1.2 mu m and 0.8 mu m while the substrate height is 1 mu m. Several performance parameters have been evaluated, including the power confinement factor (PCF), optical loss, effective mode index (neff), and electric field distribution, across varying wavelengths and dimensions of the core and cladding. The waveguides exhibit impressive PCF values of 98.65 % for the TE and 96.54 % for the TM modes. The value of PCF decreases to 86 % at a wavelength of 2.5 mu m for both TE and TM modes. The loss values are calculated as-0.895 dB/cm and-0.94 dB/cm, for the TE and TM modes, respectively. The neff are determined to be 2.53 and 2.55 for the TE and TM modes, respectively. The remarkable properties of CdTe-based photonic waveguides including a high PCF and low optical losses hold great potential for applications in optical communication, mid-infrared photonics, and quantum photonics.

TI Quantum coherence and the bell inequality violation: a numerical
   experiment with the cavity QEDs
SO FRONTIERS IN PHYSICS
AB Bell inequality violation has been widely tested by using the bipartite entangled pure states and properly encoding the local observables in various experimental platforms, and the detector-, local-, and random loopholes have already been closed. A natural question is, how to deliver the Bell inequality violation by properly encoding the local observables? Here, we show that the Bell inequality violation is directly related to the coherence degree, which is controllable by encoding the different local observables into the entangled state. With the usual space-like correlation detections, we show that the coherence degree can be measured and thus the Bell nonlocality can be tested. The feasibility of the proposal is demonstrated by a numerical experiment typically with the cavity quantum electrodynamic system, in which the coherence degrees of the locally encoded bipartite entangled state can be conveniently measured by the spectral detection of the driven cavity. The present work might provide a feasible approach to verify the Gisin theorem, i.e., Bell inequality can be violated for any bipartite entangled pure state, once the local observables are properly encoded into the entangled state for keeping the desirable coherence.

TI Quantum enhanced non-interferometric quantitative phase imaging
SO LIGHT-SCIENCE & APPLICATIONS
AB Quantum entanglement and squeezing have significantly improved phase estimation and imaging in interferometric settings beyond the classical limits. However, for a wide class of non-interferometric phase imaging/retrieval methods vastly used in the classical domain, e.g., ptychography and diffractive imaging, a demonstration of quantum advantage is still missing. Here, we fill this gap by exploiting entanglement to enhance imaging of a pure phase object in a non-interferometric setting, only measuring the phase effect on the free-propagating field. This method, based on the so-called "transport of intensity equation", is quantitative since it provides the absolute value of the phase without prior knowledge of the object and operates in wide-field mode, so it does not need time-consuming raster scanning. Moreover, it does not require spatial and temporal coherence of the incident light. Besides a general improvement of the image quality at a fixed number of photons irradiated through the object, resulting in better discrimination of small details, we demonstrate a clear reduction of the uncertainty in the quantitative phase estimation. Although we provide an experimental demonstration of a specific scheme in the visible spectrum, this research also paves the way for applications at different wavelengths, e.g., X-ray imaging, where reducing the photon dose is of utmost importance.

TI Collective neutrino oscillations with tensor networks using a
   time-dependent variational principle
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW D
AB If a system of flavor-oscillating neutrinos is at high enough densities that neutrino-neutrino coherent forward scatterings are non-negligible, the system becomes a time-dependent many-body problem. An important and open question is whether the flavor evolution is sufficiently described by a mean-field approach or can be strongly affected by correlations arising from two-body interactions in the neutrino Hamiltonian, as measured by nontrivial quantum entanglement. Numerical computations of the time evolution of many-body quantum systems are challenging because the size of the Hilbert space scales exponentially with the number of particles N in the system. Thus, it is important to investigate approximate but beyond-mean-field numerical treatments at larger values of N. Herewe investigate the efficacy of tensor network methods to calculate the time evolution of interacting neutrinos at larger values of N than are possible with conventional methods. In particular, we introduce the use of time-dependent variational principle methods to address the long-range (in momentum space) interactions of the neutrino Hamiltonian when including many distinct vacuum oscillation frequencies. We also define new error measures based upon the instantaneously conserved charge operators known for this Hamiltonian to determine validity of large-N tensor network calculations.

TI The GHZ Theorem Revisited within the Framework of Gauge Theory
SO SYMMETRY-BASEL
AB The Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger version of the Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR) paradox is widely regarded as a conclusive logical argument that rules out the possibility of reproducing the predictions of Quantum Mechanics within the framework of any physical theory sharing the notions of reality and relativistic causality that we acknowledge as a given in our classical descriptions of the macroscopic world. Thus, this renowned argument stands as a seemingly insurmountable roadblock on the path to a very desired, physically intuitive understanding of quantum phenomena and, in particular, quantum entanglement. In this paper, we notice, however, that the GHZ argument involves unaccounted spurious gauge degrees of freedom and that it can be overcome once these degrees are properly taken into account. It is then possible to explicitly build a successful statistical model for the GHZ experiment based on the usual notions of relativistic causality and physical reality. This model, thus, completes-in the EPR sense-the quantum description of the GHZ state and paves the way to a novel intuitive interpretation of the quantum formalism and a deeper understanding of the physical reality that it describes.

TI Entanglement islands in generalized two-dimensional dilaton black holes
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW D
AB The Fabbri-Russo model is a generalized model of a two-dimensional dilaton gravity theory with various parameters "n" describing various specific gravities. Particularly, the Russo-Susskind-Thorlacius gravity model fits the case n 1/4 1. In the Fabbri-Russo model, we investigate Page curves and the entanglement island. Islands are considered in eternal and evaporating black holes. Surprisingly, in any black hole, the emergence of islands causes the rise of the entanglement entropy of the radiation to decelerate after the Page time, satisfying the principle of unitarity. For eternal black holes, the fine-grained entropy reaches a saturation value that is twice the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy. For evaporating black holes, the fine-grained entropy finally reaches zero. At late times and large distance limit, the impact of the parameter "n" is a subleading term and is exponentially suppressed. As a result, the shape of Page curves is "n" independent in the leading order, which also indicates the universality of the Page curve in generalized two-dimensional models. Furthermore, we discuss the relationship between islands and firewalls. We show that the island is a better candidate than firewalls for encountering the quantum entanglement-monogamy problem. Finally, we briefly review the gravity/ensemble duality as a possible resolution to the state paradox resulting from the island formula.

Thus, creating perfect fractional vortex beams capable of stable propagation in free space, as perfect integer vortex beams, is crucial. This study proposed perfect vortex beams carrying fractional topological charge of l + 0.5, which are special solutions of the wave equation, and can maintain stable propagation with physical laws same as integer topological charge. Perfect fractional vortex beams were created in free space, which can break the cognition of traditional fractional perfect vortex beams and promote the development of scientific fields such as optical communication, quantum sensing, and optical imaging.(c) 2023 Optica Publishing Group under the terms of the Optica Open Access Publishing Agreement

TI Holographic entanglement as nonlocal magnetism
SO JOURNAL OF HIGH ENERGY PHYSICS
AB The Ryu-Takayanagi prescription can be cast in terms of a set of microscopic threads that help visualize holographic entanglement in terms of distillation of EPR pairs. While this framework has been exploited for regions with a high degree of symmetry, we take the first steps towards understanding general entangling regions, focusing on AdS4. Inspired by simple constructions achieved for the case of disks and the half-plane, we reformulate bit threads in terms of a magnetic-like field generated by a current flowing through the boundary of the entangling region. The construction is possible for these highly symmetric settings, leading us to a modified Biot-Savart law in curved space that fully characterizes the entanglement structure of the state. For general entangling regions, the prescription breaks down as the corresponding modular Hamiltonians become inherently nonlocal. We develop a formalism for general shape deformations and derive a flow equation that accounts for these effects as a systematic expansion. We solve this equation for a complete set of small deformations and show that the structure of the expansion explicitly codifies the expected nonlocalities. Our findings are consistent with numerical results existing in the literature, and shed light on the fundamental nature of quantum entanglement as a nonlocal phenomenon.

TI Entanglement-Structured LSTM Boosts Chaotic Time Series Forecasting
SO ENTROPY
AB Traditional machine-learning methods are inefficient in capturing chaos in nonlinear dynamical systems, especially when the time difference & UDelta;t between consecutive steps is so large that the extracted time series looks apparently random. Here, we introduce a new long-short-term-memory (LSTM)-based recurrent architecture by tensorizing the cell-state-to-state propagation therein, maintaining the long-term memory feature of LSTM, while simultaneously enhancing the learning of short-term nonlinear complexity. We stress that the global minima of training can be most efficiently reached by our tensor structure where all nonlinear terms, up to some polynomial order, are treated explicitly and weighted equally. The efficiency and generality of our architecture are systematically investigated and tested through theoretical analysis and experimental examinations. In our design, we have explicitly used two different many-body entanglement structures-matrix product states (MPS) and the multiscale entanglement renormalization ansatz (MERA)-as physics-inspired tensor decomposition techniques, from which we find that MERA generally performs better than MPS, hence conjecturing that the learnability of chaos is determined not only by the number of free parameters but also the tensor complexity-recognized as how entanglement entropy scales with varying matricization of the tensor.

TI Scientific intuition inspired by machine learning-generated hypotheses
SO MACHINE LEARNING-SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB Machine learning with application to questions in the physical sciences has become a widely used tool, successfully applied to classification, regression and optimization tasks in many areas. Research focus mostly lies in improving the accuracy of the machine learning models in numerical predictions, while scientific understanding is still almost exclusively generated by human researchers analysing numerical results and drawing conclusions. In this work, we shift the focus on the insights and the knowledge obtained by the machine learning models themselves. In particular, we study how it can be extracted and used to inspire human scientists to increase their intuitions and understanding of natural systems. We apply gradient boosting in decision trees to extract human-interpretable insights from big data sets from chemistry and physics. In chemistry, we not only rediscover widely know rules of thumb but also find new interesting motifs that tell us how to control solubility and energy levels of organic molecules. At the same time, in quantum physics, we gain new understanding on experiments for quantum entanglement. The ability to go beyond numerics and to enter the realm of scientific insight and hypothesis generation opens the door to use machine learning to accelerate the discovery of conceptual understanding in some of the most challenging domains of science.

TI Large amplitude mechanical coherent states and detection of weak
   nonlinearities in cavity optomechanics
SO QUANTUM SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB The generation of large-amplitude coherent states of a massive mechanical resonator, and their quantum-limited detection represent useful tools for quantum sensing and for testing fundamental physics theories. In fact, any weak perturbation may affect the coherent quantum evolution of the prepared state, providing a sensitive probe for such a perturbation. Here we consider a cavity optomechanical setup and the case of the detection of a weak mechanical nonlinearity. We consider different strategies, first focusing on the stationary dynamics in the presence of multiple tones driving the system, and then focusing on non-equilibrium dynamical strategies. These methods can be successfully applied for measuring Duffing-like material nonlinearities, or effective nonlinear corrections associated with quantum gravity theories.

AB This article discusses the advances in magnet flow metering research. This innovative metering procedure leverages nuclear magnetic resonance and magnetometry methods in the zero-to-ultra-low magnetic field regime to non-invasively measure the flow velocity of a hydrogen-containing fluid using novel quantum magnetometers. After demonstrating the flow metering capabilities, the procedure presented is analyzed further to research on the influences of experimental conditions on radio frequency pulse efficiency in flowing media. It shows that the flow profile plays a predominant role in RF pulse efficiency, providing a foundation for future research regarding the flow profile sensitivity of magnetic flow metering.

TI Charge-state stability of color centers in wide band gap semiconductors
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
AB The NV- color center in diamond has been extensively investigated for applications in quantum sensing, computation, and communication. Nonetheless, charge-state decay from the NV- to its neutral counterpart the NV0 detrimentally affects the robustness of the NV- center and remains to be fully overcome. In this work, we provide an ab initio formalism for accurately estimating the rate of charge-state decay of color centers in wide band gap semiconductors. Our formalism employs density functional theory calculations in the context of thermal equilibrium. We illustrate the method using the transition of NV- to NV0 in the presence of substitutional N [see Z. Yuan et al., Phys. Rev. Res. 2, 033263 (2020)].

Our study explores such tunneling-based sensors for the measurement of accelerations in two configurations: (a) a transmission setup, where the initial wave packet is transmitted through the cavity and (b) an out-tunneling scheme with intra-cavity generated initial states lacking a classical counterpart. We perform numerical simulations of the complete dynamics of the quantum wave packet, investigate the tunneling through a matter-wave cavity formed by realistic optical potentials and determine the impact of interactions between atoms. As a consequence we estimate the prospective sensitivities to inertial forces for both proposed configurations and show their feasibility for serving as inertial sensors.

TI Purcell Effect in Epsilon-Near-Zero Microcavities
SO ACS OMEGA
AB Epsilon-near-zero (ENZ) photonics offers a compelling platform for integrated photonic systems, enabling a range of novel and extraordinary functionalities. However, the practical deployment of ENZ-based devices is constrained by high material losses and severe impedance mismatch, which are detrimental to applications requiring coherent light manipulation and efficient light-matter interaction. To address these challenges, we demonstrate that all-dielectric Bragg-reflection microcavities operated near their cutoff frequency, offer an ultralow-loss platform for enhancing light-matter interaction and exploring emission processes in the ENZ regime. While Bragg cavities are well-established, their potential as ENZ resonant microcavities remains largely unexplored. We investigate the Purcell effect and quality factor in these structures, comparing their performance with those of the perfect-electric-conductor and metallic counterparts. Through analytical derivations based on Fermi's golden rule and field quantization in lossless dispersive media, we establish scaling laws that distinguish these ENZ cavities from conventional resonators. Frequency domain simulations validate our counterintuitive findings, demonstrating that in all-dielectric ENZ Bragg-reflection microcavities, the Purcell and quality factors scale as L/lambda 0 and (L/lambda 0)3, respectively, where L is the cavity length and lambda 0 is the resonance wavelength. Our results offer key insights into the design of ENZ-based photonic systems, paving the way for enhanced light-matter interactions in nonlinear optics and quantum photonics.

AB NTRU is a well-known lattice-based cryptosystem that has been selected as one of the four key encapsulation mechanism finalists in Round 3 of NIST's post-quantum cryptography standardization. This paper presents two succinct and efficient chosen-ciphertext side-channel attacks on the latest variants of NTRU, i.e., NTRU-HPS and NTRU-HRSS as in Round 3 submissions. Both methods utilize the leakage from the polynomial modular reduction to recover the long-term secret key. For the first attack, although the side-channel leakage does not directly reveal the secret polynomial f, we recover differences between adjacent coefficients using appropriately chosen ciphertexts, and finally reconstruct f through linear algebra. The second attack is based on the inherent relation between the secret key and the public key in NTRU-HPS: we first reveal the "invisible" secret polynomial g with chosen ciphertexts and then use g and the public polynomial h to compute f. In theory, these attacks only need 4 and 2 ciphertexts, respectively. We then practically apply those attacks on all reference implementations of four instances in the PQClean library and show that the accuracy of secret-key recovery can reach 100% with only few traces (4 to 24 and 2 to 6, respectively). We also observe similar leakage in optimized implementations in the pqm4 library and propose an according analysis scheme.

TI Integer syndrome decoding in the presence of noise
SO CRYPTOGRAPHY AND COMMUNICATIONS-DISCRETE-STRUCTURES BOOLEAN FUNCTIONS
   AND SEQUENCES
AB Code-based cryptography received attention after the NIST started the post-quantum cryptography standardization process in 2016. A central NP-hard problem is the binary syndrome decoding problem, on which the security of many code-based cryptosystems lies. The best known methods to solve this problem all stem from the information-set decoding strategy, first introduced by Prange in 1962. A recent line of work considers augmented versions of this strategy, with hints typically provided by side-channel information. In this work, we consider the integer syndrome decoding problem, where the integer syndrome is available but might be noisy. We study how the performance of the decoder is affected by the noise. First we identify the noise model as being close to a centered in zero binomial distribution. Second we model the probability of success of the ISD-score decoder in presence of a binomial noise. Third, we demonstrate that with high probability our algorithm finds the solution as long as the noise parameter d is linear in t (the Hamming weight of the solution) and t is sub-linear in the code-length. We provide experimental results on cryptographic parameters for the BIKE and Classic McEliece cryptosystems, which are both candidates for the fourth round of the NIST standardization process.

TI DMLBC: Dependable machine learning for seaports using blockchain
   technology
SO JOURNAL OF KING SAUD UNIVERSITY-COMPUTER AND INFORMATION SCIENCES
AB The technological shifts driven by Industry 4.0 and the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic has ushered new challenges for seaports, necessitating a transformation in their information and communications systems to enhance global competitiveness. As the United Nations (UN) International Maritime Organization mandates the adoption of a Maritime Single Window in short time, seaports are compelled to adapt their operations. Addressing these challenges, this research introduces the Dependable Machine Learning for seaports using Blockchain (DMLBC) method, offering a secure technological system that integrates transactional data among various logistics stakeholders. DMLBC enhances efficiency in document control, traceability, loading processes, and collaborative workflows. The method employs a architecture grounded in Blockchain (BC) and harnesses Machine Learning Techniques. In a practical application, DMLBC is implemented in a real case study, demonstrating its efficacy for decision making of port operations. The research discusses the contributions that the DMLBC method has compared to what exists in the bibliographic review and in other port industries worldwide. Describes future exploration directions and It emphasizes the potential for generating additional predictions by incorporating others Key Performance Indicators (KPI)s, integrating DMLBC with Decision Support System (DSS), and delving into the realm of Post -Quantum Cryptography (PQC) to fortify the security of seaport operations in the evolving technological landscape.

TI An Operational Notion of Classicality Based on Physical Principles
SO FOUNDATIONS OF PHYSICS
AB One of the basic observations of the classical world is that physical entities are real and can be distinguished from each other. However, within quantum theory, the idea of physical realism is not well established. A framework to analyse how observations in experiments can be described using some physical states of reality was recently developed, known as ontological models framework. Different principles when imposed on the ontological level give rise to different theories, the validity of which can be tested based on the statistics generated by these theories. Using the ontological models framework, we formulate a novel notion of classicality termed ontic-distinguishability, which is based upon the physical principles that in classical theories extremal states are physical states of reality and every sharp measurement observes the state of the system perfectly. We construct a communication task in which the success probability is bounded from above for ontological models satisfying the notion of ontic-distinguishability. Contrary to previous notions of classicality which either required systems of dimension strictly greater than two or atleast three preparations, a violation of ontic-distinguishability can be observed using just a pair of qubits and a pair of incompatible measurements. We further show that violation of previously known notions of classicality such as preparation non-contextuality and Bell's local causality is a violation of ontic-distinguishability.

TI Diagonal unitary and orthogonal symmetries in quantum theory: II.

SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICS A-MATHEMATICAL AND THEORETICAL
AB We study bipartite unitary operators which stay invariant under the local actions of diagonal unitary and orthogonal groups. We investigate structural properties of these operators, arguing that the diagonal symmetry makes them suitable for analytical study. As a first application, we construct large new families of dual unitary gates in arbitrary finite dimensions, which are important toy models for entanglement spreading in quantum circuits. We then analyze the non-local nature of these invariant operators, both in discrete (operator Schmidt rank) and continuous (entangling power) settings. Our scrutiny reveals that these operators can be used to simulate any bipartite unitary gate via stochastic local operations and classical communication. Furthermore, we establish a one-to-one connection between the set of local diagonal unitary invariant dual unitary operators with maximum entangling power and the set of complex Hadamard matrices. Finally, we discuss distinguishability of unitary operators in the setting of the stated diagonal symmetry.

TI Facile dual-shot measurement of Schmidt number in type-0 and type-2
   downconversion
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB High-dimensional entangled states have now been identified as excellent candidates towards the enhancement of the bandwidth of quantum systems. A variety of methods exist that aim to certify and set the bounds to entanglement. However, rapid and accurate approaches for precise quantification of the dimensions remain a challenge. Here, we report a facile, rapid and robust approach that quantifies a wide range of the spatial dimensions of high-dimensional entangled states using an interferometric technique using only two images. Our process works for a class of pure two-photon states, regardless of its separability and provides a fast and easy way to accurately measure the spatial Schmidt number which is a quantitative measure of dimensionality of entanglement. We apply our method to two-photon states generated by spontaneous parametric down-conversion (SPDC) and show that our results are in excellent agreement with numerical estimates. Since such estimates only exist for collinear phase matching in SPDC crystals, we also derive a noncollinear phase-matching condition applicable for type-2 crystals. In these nonlinear crystals, the commonly applied assumption of degenerate daughter photons no longer holds, leading to deviations from earlier theoretical predictions. Our interferometric technique provides excellent results for both type-0 and type-2 collinear phase-matching conditions, endorsing its wide applicability in quantum photonics.

TI Gull's Theorem Revisited
SO ENTROPY
AB In 2016, Steve Gull has outlined has outlined a proof of Bell's theorem using Fourier theory. Gull's philosophy is that Bell's theorem (or perhaps a key lemma in its proof) can be seen as a no-go theorem for a project in distributed computing with classical, not quantum, computers. We present his argument, correcting misprints and filling gaps. In his argument, there were two completely separated computers in the network. We need three in order to fill all the gaps in his proof: a third computer supplies a stream of random numbers to the two computers representing the two measurement stations in Bell's work. One could also imagine that computer replaced by a cloned, virtual computer, generating the same pseudo-random numbers within each of Alice and Bob's computers. Either way, we need an assumption of the presence of shared i.i.d. randomness in the form of a synchronised sequence of realisations of i.i.d. hidden variables underlying the otherwise deterministic physics of the sequence of trials. Gull's proof then just needs a third step: rewriting an expectation as the expectation of a conditional expectation given the hidden variables.

In this paper, motivated by recent developments regarding the black hole information problem, we present extensive studies of moving mirrors in conformal field theories by employing both field theoretic as well as holographic methods. Reviewing first the usual field theoretic formulation of moving mirrors, we construct their gravity dual by resorting to the AdS/BCFT construction. Based on our holographic formulation, we then calculate the time evolution of entanglement entropy in various moving mirror models. In doing so, we mainly focus on three different setups: escaping mirror, which models constant Hawking radiation emanating from an eternal black hole; kink mirror, which models an evaporating black hole formed from collapse; and the double escaping mirror, which models two constantly radiating eternal black holes. In particular, by computing the holographic entanglement entropy, we show that the kink mirror gives rise to an ideal Page curve. We also find that an interesting phase transition arises in the case of the double escaping mirror. Furthermore, we argue and provide evidence for an interpretation of moving mirrors in terms of two dimensional Liouville gravity. We also discuss the connection between quantum energy conditions and the time evolution of holographic entanglement entropy in moving mirror models.

TI Heisenberg Group-Based Digital Signatures for Secure Communications
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB This paper proposes a new digital signature algorithm that employs the Heisenberg group over a prime field and exploits its structure to provide strong cryptographic properties. The developed scheme involves the Heisenberg group within a commutator-based authentication system contributing to key exchange while providing secure means of authentication as well as data integrity. The proposed method for digital signature generation and verification is described by a comprehensive algorithm, which proof of correctness is provided by a confirmation theorem. The security analysis establishes the strength of the scheme against different cryptanalytic attacks and proves the effectiveness of non-repudiation and message integrity in the digital environment. The efficiency of the presented security scheme is also evaluated in practice, using the finite field $\mathbb {Z}_{11}$ , where it is measured against other standards such as ECDSA and RSA. While it has a bigger signature size, the scheme is still efficient when it comes to signing and verifying messages which highlights its suitability for protecting communications under post-quantum cryptography. It supports the on-going progress of cryptography, giving added security to new technologies when faced with the threat of complex attacks.

TI Lightweight, Post-Quantum Secure Cryptography Based on Ascon: Hardware
   Implementation in Automotive Applications
SO ELECTRONICS
AB With the rapid growth of connected vehicles and the vulnerability of embedded systems against cyber attacks in an era where quantum computers are becoming a reality, post-quantum cryptography (PQC) is a crucial solution. Yet, by nature, automotive sensors are limited in power, processing capability, memory in implementing secure measures. This study presents a pioneering approach to securing automotive systems against post-quantum threats by integrating the Ascon cipher suite-a lightweight cryptographic protocol-into embedded automotive environments. By combining Ascon with the Controller Area Network (CAN) protocol on an Artix-7 Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA), we achieve low power consumption while ensuring high performance in post-quantum-resistant cryptographic tasks. The Ascon module is designed to optimize computational efficiency through bitwise Boolean operations and logic gates, avoiding resource-intensive look-up tables and achieving superior processing speed. Our hardware design delivers significant speed improvements of 100 times over software implementations and operates effectively within a 100 MHz clock while demonstrating low resource usage. Furthermore, a custom digital signal processing block supports CAN protocol integration, handling message alignment and synchronization to maintain signal integrity under automotive environmental noise. Our work provides a power-efficient, robust cryptographic solution that prepares automotive systems for quantum-era security challenges, emphasizing lightweight cryptography's readiness for real-world deployment in automotive industries.

TI Anatomy of non-Hermitian dynamical quantum phase transitions
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
AB We establish a unified framework for dynamical quantum phase transitions (DQPTs) in non-Hermitian systems that encompasses both biorthogonal and self-norm nonbiorthogonal formulations for pure and mixed states under quantum quench protocols. Our framework provides explicit expressions for the Loschmidt amplitude, Loschmidt echo, and rate function, revealing a universal geometric signature of DQPTs in the two-band model: orthogonality of two related vectors in two-dimensional real space. Strikingly, we demonstrate that nonbiorthogonal quenches from non-Hermitian to Hermitian Hamiltonians under chiral symmetry exhibit emergent topological characteristics of DQPTs, unveiling their fundamental features beyond conventional Hermitian regimes. This work establishes fundamental geometric and topological principles governing quantum criticality in open systems, with implications for quantum sensing and many-body physics in dissipative environments.

TI Multi-Keyword Searchable Identity-Based Proxy Re-Encryption from
   Lattices
SO MATHEMATICS
AB To protect the privacy of cloud data, encryption before uploading provides a solution. However, searching for target data in ciphertext takes effort. Therefore, searchable encryption has become an important research topic. On the other hand, since the advancement of quantum computers will lead to the crisis of cracking traditional encryption algorithms, it is necessary to design encryption schemes that can resist quantum attacks. Therefore, we propose a multi-keyword searchable identity-based proxy re-encryption scheme from lattices. In addition to resisting quantum attacks, the proposed scheme uses several cryptographic techniques to improve encryption efficiency. First, identity-based encryption is used to reduce the computation and transmission costs caused by certificates. Second, the proposed scheme uses proxy re-encryption to achieve the purpose of outsourced computing, allowing the proxy server to reduce the computation and transmission costs of the users. Third, the proposed multi-keyword searchable encryption can provide AND and OR operators to increase the flexibility of searchability. Moreover, the access structure of the proposed scheme is not based on a linear secret sharing scheme (LSSS), avoiding the errors caused by an LSSS-based structure in decryption or search results. Finally, we also give formal security proof of the proposed scheme under the decisional learning with errors assumption.

TI Machine-Learning Side-Channel Attacks on the GALACTICS Constant-Time

AB Due to the advancing development of quantum computers, practical attacks on conventional public-key cryptography may become feasible in the next few decades. To address this risk, post-quantum schemes that are assumed to be secure against quantum attacks are being developed. Lattice-based algorithms are promising replacements for conventional schemes, with BLISS being one of the earliest post-quantum signature schemes in this family. However, required subroutines such as Gaussian sampling have been demonstrated to be a risk for the security of BLISS, since implementing Gaussian sampling both efficient and secure with respect to physical attacks is challenging.
   This paper presents three related power side-channel attacks on GALACTICS, the latest constant-time implementation of BLISS. All attacks are based on power side-channel leakages we identified in the Gaussian sampling and signing algorithm of GALACTICS. To run the attacks, a profiling phase on a device identical to the device under attack is required to train machine learning classifiers. In the attack phase, the leakages of GALACTICS enable the trained classifiers to predict sensitive internal information with high accuracy. We demonstrate the practicality of the attacks by running GALACTICS on a Cortex-M4 and provide proof-of-concept data and implementation for all our attacks.

TI Recent progress on femtosecond laser micro-/nano-fabrication of
   functional photonic structures in dielectric crystals: A brief review
   and perspective
SO APL PHOTONICS
AB Femtosecond (Fs) laser micro-/nano-fabrication technology allows direct definition of on-demand nanostructures with three-dimensional (3D) geometric features and tailored photonic functionalities in a facile manner. In addition, such a strategy is widely applicable to various material families, including dielectrics, semiconductors, and metals. Based on diverse dielectric crystals, fs-laser direct writing of optical wave-guides with flexible geometries and functional waveguide-based photonic devices have been well-developed. Beyond waveguide architectures, the combination of 3D nanofabrication of fs lasers and the multi-functionalities of dielectric crystals has also lighted up the future develop-ment of novel photonic structures with features even beyond the optical diffraction limit. In this article, promising research topics on domain engineering for nonlinear optics, color centers and waveguides for integrated quantum photonics, and surface processing for integrated pho-tonics enabled by fs laser micro-/nano-fabrication in dielectric crystals are briefly overviewed. We highlight recent progress on these research topics and stress the importance of optical aberration correction during laser fabrication, followed by a discussion of challenges and foreseeing the future development of fs laser defined nanostructures in dielectric crystals toward multi-functional photonics.

TI Theory of Andreev blockade in a double quantum dot with a
   superconducting lead
SO SCIPOST PHYSICS
AB A normal metal source reservoir can load two electrons onto a double quantum dot in the spin-triplet configuration. We show that if the drain lead of the dot is a spin-singlet superconductor, these electrons cannot form a Cooper pair and are blockaded on the double dot. We call this phenomenon Andreev blockade because it arises due to suppressed Andreev reflections. We identify transport characteristics unique to Andreev blockade. Most significantly, it occurs for any occupation of the dot adjacent to the superconductor, in contrast with the well-studied Pauli blockade which requires odd occupations. Andreev blockade is lifted if quasiparticles are allowed to enter the superconducting lead, but it should be observable in the hard gap superconductor-semiconductor devices. A recent experiment tests this model and finds support for several predictions made here [1]. Andreev blockade should be considered in the design of topological quantum circuits, hybrid quantum bits and quantum emulators.

AB This paper builds a corresponding micro-displacement test system based on an ensemble nitrogen-vacancy (NV) color center magnetometer by combining the correlation between a magnetic flux concentrator, a permanent magnet, and micro-displacement. By comparing the measurement results obtained with and without the magnetic flux concentrator, it can be seen that the resolution of the system under the magnetic flux concentrator can reach 25 nm, which is 24 times higher than without the magnetic flux concentrator. The effectiveness of the method is proven. The above results provide a practical reference for high-precision micro-displacement detection based on the diamond ensemble.

TI High bandwidth laser frequency locking for wideband noise suppression
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB Ultra-low frequency noise lasers have been widely used in laser-based experiments. Most narrow-linewidth lasers are implemented by actively suppressing their frequency noise through a frequency noise servo loop (FNSL). The loop bandwidths (LBW) of FNSLs are currently below megahertz, which is gradually tricky to meet application requirements, especially for wideband quantum sensing experiments. This article has experimentally implemented an FNSL with loop-delay-limited 3.5 MHz LBW, which is an order higher than the usual FNSLs. Using this FNSL, we achieved 70 dB laser frequency noise suppression over 100 kHz Fourier frequency range. This technology has broad applications in vast fields where wideband laser frequency noise suppression is inevitable.

Finally, we use the microscope to obtain images of an integrated cell heater and a PCB, demonstrating its ability in the application of magnetic field and temperature simultaneously imaging at wide-field.

AB We present a protocol to produce a class of non-thermal Fock state mixtures in trapped ions. This class of states features a clear metrological advantage with respect to the ground state, thus overcoming the standard quantum limit without the need for full sideband cooling and Fock-state preparation on a narrow electronic transition. The protocol consists in the cyclic repetition of red-sideband (RSB), measurement and preparation laser pulses. By means of the Kraus map representation of the protocol, it is possible to relate the length of the RSB pulses to the specific class of states that can be generated. With the help of numerical simulations, we analyse the parametric regime where these states can be reliably reproduced.

TI Q-SAFE QUANTUM AI FOR REAL-TIME WOMEN & CHILD SAFETY
SO ARCHIVES FOR TECHNICAL SCIENCES
AB As incidents of gendered violence and child abuse increase, there is a need for intelligent, real-time safety systems that autonomously detect distress and initiate emergency action without user activation. Q-SAFE (Quantum AI for Real-Time Women & Child Safety) is an open-source, multi-modal mobile app, utilizing quantum-enhanced machine learning models to detect panic situations based on audio cues (spoken and non-spoken) and motion. The system automatically generates an emergency broadcast that shares live location, messages alerts, and takes videos (in secure cloud storage) in the following ways: automatically detects predetermined distress words using existing Quantum /Indeterminate Natural Language Processing (NLP) classifiers, their corresponding visual module pending; and via accelerometer-based gesture recognition. Most importantly, due to employment of post-quantum cryptographic protocols, the emergency broadcasts use secure communication that does not depend on the users activating any manual processes. Q-SAFE departs from self-activated panic button approaches used in the past noting that fully autonomous systems that require no user activation have been absent for decades. Q-SAFE was developed using scalable technologies, while also conducting tests using multiple scenarios for future robustness, and emerges as an intelligent and privacy-respecting sentinel and caretaker for those that are most vulnerable.

TI Geometric Mean Labeling in Cryptography: A Graph-Based Approach to
   Enhanced Security and Performance
SO CONTEMPORARY MATHEMATICS
AB Cryptographic security is essential for ensuring data integrity and secure communication. Traditional encryption methods such as RSA and elliptic curve cryptography (ECC), while widely used, suffer from high computational complexity, large key sizes, and vulnerability to evolving attack strategies. This paper introduces geometric mean labeling (GML), a novel graph-based cryptographic technique that enhances encryption efficiency, key management, and security. Unlike RSA, which relies on prime factorization, or ECC, which depends on elliptic curve logarithms, GML applies geometric mean-based transformations to encrypt data using structured graph relationships, making it computationally efficient. Specifically, GML achieves encryption in just 0.085 ms with a 512-bit key, compared to 600 ms (RSA, 2,048-bit) and 30 ms (ECC, 256-bit), leading to a 99.99% speed improvement over RSA and 99.7% over ECC. Theoretical analysis confirms that GML operates with a computational complexity of O(V3), making it scalable for large-scale encryption while maintaining strong security against brute-force and chosen-plaintext attacks. Experimental validation was conducted on an Intel i7-based system, confirming the efficiency and reliability of GML for real-world applications such as IoT security and cloud encryption. By integrating GML into modern cryptographic frameworks, this study provides a scalable, efficient, and future-ready encryption solution, with potential applications in post-quantum cryptography.

TI POST-QUANTUM SECURE FULLY-DYNAMIC LOGARITHMIC-SIZE DENIABLE GROUP
   SIGNATURE IN CODE-BASED SETTING
SO ADVANCES IN MATHEMATICS OF COMMUNICATIONS
AB Since its introduction by Chaum and Heyst, group signature has been one of the most active areas of cryptographic research with numerous applications to computer security and privacy. Group signature permits the members of a group to sign a document on behalf of the entire group keeping signer's identity secret and enabling disclosure of the signer's identity if required. In this work, we present the first code-based fully-dynamic group signature scheme which allows group members to join or leave the group at any point of time. We employ a code-based updatable Merkle-tree accumulator in our design to achieve logarithmic-size signature and utilize randomized Niederreiter encryption to trace the identity of the signer. More positively, we equipped our scheme with deniability characteristic whereby the tracing authority can furnish evidence showing that a given member is not the signer of a particular signature. Our scheme satisfies the security requirements of anonymity, non-frameability, traceability and tracing-soundness in the random oracle model under the hardness of generic decoding problem. We emphasize that our scheme provides full-dynamicity, features deniability in contrast to the existing code-based group signature schemes and works favourably in terms of signature size, group public key size and secret key size.

TI Quantum Oblivious Transfer with Reusable Bell State
SO CMC-COMPUTERS MATERIALS & CONTINUA
AB In cryptography, oblivious transfer (OT) is an important multi-party cryptographic primitive and protocol, that is suitable for many upper -layer applications, such as secure computation, remote coin-flipping, electrical contract signing and exchanging secrets simultaneously. However, some no-go theorems have been established, indicating that one-out-of-two quantum oblivious transfer (QOT) protocols with unconditional security are impossi-ble. Fortunately, some one-out-of-two QOT protocols using the concept of Crepeau's reduction have been demonstrated not to conform to Lo's no-go theorem, but these protocols require more quantum resources to generate classical keys using all-or-nothing QOT to construct one-out-of-two QOT. This paper proposes a novel and efficient one-out-of-two QOT which uses quantum resources directly instead of wasting unnecessary resources to gener-ate classical keys. The proposed protocol is not covered by Lo's no-go theorem, and it is able to check the sender's loyalty and avoid the attack from the receiver. Moreover, the entangled state of the proposed protocol is reusable, so it can provide more services for the participants when necessary. Compared with other QOT protocols, the proposed protocol is more secure, efficient, and flexible, which not only can prevent external and internal attacks, but also reduce the required resources and resource distribution time.

TI Observation of quantum Darwinism and the origin of classicality with
   superconducting circuits
SO SCIENCE ADVANCES
AB The transition from quantum to classical behavior is a central question in modern physics. How can we rationalize everyday classical observations from an inherently quantum world? Quantum Darwinism offers a compelling framework to explain this by proposing that the environment redundantly encodes information about a quantum system, leading to the objective reality. Here, by leveraging cutting-edge superconducting quantum circuits, we observe the highly structured branching quantum states that support classicality and the saturation of quantum mutual information, establishing a robust verification of quantum Darwinism and the underlying geometric structure of quantum states. Additionally, we propose a particular class of observables that can be used as a computationally and experimentally inexpensive quantifier to probe quantum-to-classical transitions. Our investigation delves into how the quantum effects are inaccessible to observers, allowing only classical properties to be detected. It experimentally demonstrates the physical framework through which everyday classical observations emerge from underlying quantum principles and paves the way to settling the measurement problem.

TI QTN-VQC: an end-to-end learning framework for quantum neural networks
SO PHYSICA SCRIPTA
AB This work focuses on investigating an end-to-end learning approach for quantum neural networks (QNN) on noisy intermediate-scale quantum devices. The proposed model combines a quantum tensor network (QTN) with a variational quantum circuit (VQC), resulting in a QTN-VQC architecture. This architecture integrates a QTN with a horizontal or vertical structure related to the implementation of quantum circuits for a tensor-train network. The study provides theoretical insights into the quantum advantages of the end-to-end learning pipeline based on QTN-VQC from two perspectives. The first perspective refers to the theoretical understanding of QTN-VQC with upper bounds on the empirical error, examining its learnability and generalization powers; The second perspective focuses on using the QTN-VQC architecture to alleviate the Barren Plateau problem in the training stage. Our experimental simulation on CPU/GPUs is performed on a handwritten digit classification dataset to corroborate our proposed methods in this work.

TI DCryp-Unit: Crypto Hardware Accelerator Unit Design for Elliptic Curve
   Point Multiplication
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB We propose a hardware-optimized design that implements a Montgomery Elliptic-curve point multiplication Algorithm over GF(2(233)) using Lopez-Dahab projective coordinates. Moreover, we propose a digit-parallel modular multiplier, which reduces clock cycles and improves throughput. Also, we provided how to use our proposed digit-parallel multiplier for post-quantum cryptography algorithms. In addition, we use the proposed digit-parallel multiplier with the square circuit to implement the Itoh-Tsujii inversion algorithm for modular inversion computation; this permits hardware resource minimization. An efficient finite-state machine controller is implemented for control functionalities. A figure of merit in throughput/area is defined for reasonable comparison to state-of-the-art. We provide implementation results after post-place-and-route on field-programmable gate array devices. On the Virtex-7 device, our design utilizes 3386 slices and requires 7218 clock cycles; it achieves a maximum frequency of 365 MHz and computes one point multiplication in 19.77 mu s . The total power consumption of our design is 2027 mW. The calculated values for throughput and figure of merit are 50.58Kbps and 14.93, respectively. Consequently, the implementation results and comparisons reveal our design's suitability for applications requiring area and throughput-optimized cryptographic implementations.

TI Variational denoising for variational quantum eigensolver
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB The variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) is a hybrid algorithm that has the potential to provide a quantum advantage in practical chemistry problems that are currently intractable on classical computers. VQE trains parameterized quantum circuits using a classical optimizer to approximate the eigenvalues and eigenstates of a given Hamiltonian. However, VQE faces challenges in task-specific design and machine-specific architecture, particularly when running on noisy quantum devices. This can have a negative impact on its trainability, accuracy, and efficiency, resulting in noisy quantum data. We propose variational denoising, an unsupervised learning method that employs a parameterized quantum neural network to improve the solution of VQE by learning from noisy VQE outputs. Our approach can significantly decrease energy estimation errors and increase fidelities with ground states compared to noisy input data for the H2, LiH, and BeH2 molecular Hamiltonians and the transverse field Ising model. Surprisingly, it only requires noisy data for training. Variational denoising can be integrated into quantum hardware, increasing its versatility as an end-to-end quantum processing for quantum data.

TI Large-scale free-space photonic circuits in two dimensions
SO ADVANCED PHOTONICS
AB Photonic circuits, engineered to couple optical modes according to a specific map, serve as processors for classical and quantum light. The number of components typically scales with that of processed modes, thus correlating system size, circuit complexity, and optical losses. We present a photonic-circuit technology implementing large-scale unitary maps in free space, coupling a single input to hundreds of output modes in a two-dimensional compact layout. The map corresponds to a quantum walk of structured photons, realized through light propagation in three liquid-crystal metasurfaces, having their optic axes artificially patterned. Theoretically, the walk length and the number of connected modes can be arbitrary while keeping losses constant. The patterns can be designed to replicate multiple unitary maps. We also discuss limited reconfigurability by adjusting the overall birefringence and the relative displacement of the optical elements. These results lay the basis for the design of low-loss nonintegrated photonic circuits, primarily for manipulating multiphoton states in quantum regimes.

TI Optical actuation of a micromechanical photodiode via the
   photovoltaic-piezoelectric effect
SO MICROSYSTEMS & NANOENGINEERING
AB Radiation pressure and photothermal forces have been previously used to optically actuate micro/nanomechanical structures fabricated from semiconductor piezoelectric materials such as gallium arsenide (GaAs). In these materials, coupling of the photovoltaic and piezoelectric properties has not been fully explored and leads to a new type of optical actuation that we call the photovoltaic-piezoelectric effect (PVPZ). We demonstrate this effect by electrically measuring, via the direct piezoelectric effect, the optically induced strain in a novel torsional resonator. The micron-scale torsional resonator is fabricated from a lattice-matched single-crystal molecular beam epitaxy (MBE)-grown GaAs photodiode heterostructure. We find that the strain depends on the product of the electro-optic responsivity and piezoelectric constant of GaAs. The photovoltaic-piezoelectric effect has important potential applications, such as in the development of configurable optical circuits, which can be used in neuromorphic photonic chips, processing of big data with deep learning and the development of quantum circuits.

TI MEMO-QCD: quantum density estimation through memetic optimisation for
   quantum circuit design
SO QUANTUM MACHINE INTELLIGENCE
AB This paper presents a strategy for efficient quantum circuit design for density estimation. The strategy is based on a quantum-inspired algorithm for density estimation and a circuit optimisation routine based on memetic algorithms. The model maps a training dataset to a quantum state represented by a density matrix through a quantum feature map. This training state encodes the probability distribution of the dataset in a quantum state, such that the density of a new sample can be estimated by projecting its corresponding quantum state onto the training state. We propose the application of a memetic algorithm to find the architecture and parameters of a variational quantum circuit that implements the quantum feature map, along with a variational learning strategy to prepare the training state. Demonstrations of the proposed strategy show an accurate approximation of the Gaussian kernel density estimation method through shallow quantum circuits illustrating the feasibility of the algorithm for near-term quantum hardware.

TI Random circuits in the black hole interior
SO SCIPOST PHYSICS
AB We present a quantitative holographic relation between a microscopic measure of randomness and the geometric length of the wormhole in the black hole interior. To this end, we perturb an AdS black hole with Brownian semiclassical sources, implementing the continuous version of a random quantum circuit for the black hole. We use the random circuit to prepare ensembles of states of the black hole whose semiclassical duals contain Einstein-Rosen (ER) caterpillars: Long cylindrical wormholes with large numbers of matter inhomogeneities, of linearly growing length with the circuit time. In this setup, we show semiclassically that the ensemble of ER caterpillars of average length k & ell;triangle and matter correlation scale & ell;triangle forms an approximate quantum state k-design of the black hole. At exponentially long circuit times, the ensemble of ER caterpillars becomes polynomial-copy indistinguishable from a collection of random states of the black hole. We comment on the implications of these results for holographic circuit complexity and for the holographic description of the black hole interior.

TI On the Realistic Worst-Case Analysis of Quantum Arithmetic Circuits
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON QUANTUM ENGINEERING
AB We provide evidence that commonly held intuitions when designing quantum circuits can be misleading. In particular, we show that 1) reducing the T-count can increase the total depth; 2) it may be beneficial to trade controlled NOTs for measurements in noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) circuits; 2) measurement-based uncomputation of relative phase Toffoli ancillae can make up to 30% of a circuit's depth; and 4) area and volume cost metrics can misreport the resource analysis. Our findings assume that qubits are and will remain a very scarce resource. The results are applicable for both NISQ and quantum error-corrected protected circuits. Our method uses multiple ways of decomposing Toffoli gates into Clifford+T gates. We illustrate our method on addition and multiplication circuits using ripple-carry. As a byproduct result, we show systematically that for a practically significant range of circuit widths, ripple-carry addition circuits are more resource-efficient than the carry-lookahead addition ones. The methods and circuits were implemented in the open-source QUANTIFY software.

TI Riemannian optimization of isometric tensor networks
SO SCIPOST PHYSICS
AB Several tensor networks are built of isometric tensors, i.e. tensors satisfying W?W = 1. Prominent examples include matrix product states (MPS) in canonical form, the multiscale entanglement renormalization ansatz (MERA), and quantum circuits in general, such as those needed in state preparation and quantum variational eigensolvers. We show how gradient-based optimization methods on Riemannian manifolds can be used to optimize tensor networks of isometries to represent e.g. ground states of 1D quantum Hamiltonians. We discuss the geometry of Grassmann and Stiefel manifolds, the Riemannian manifolds of isometric tensors, and review how state-of-the-art optimization methods like nonlinear conjugate gradient and quasi-Newton algorithms can be implemented in this context. We apply these methods in the context of infinite MPS and MERA, and show benchmark results in which they outperform the best previously-known optimization methods, which are tailor-made for those specific variational classes. We also provide open-source implementations of our algorithms.

SO ICT EXPRESS
AB Photovoltaic power generation forecasting is crucial for energy management, smart grid construction, and energy markets. This study proposes a hybrid quantum-classical gated recurrent unit (HQGRU)-based framework for forecasting short-term photovoltaic power generation in a time-series manner. The HQGRU model uses a classical layer followed by a quantum embedding circuit to convert classical data into quantum data. Subsequently, variational quantum circuits are used for feature extraction. To demonstrate the performance of the proposed model, we used practical data on photovoltaic power generation and the weather in Busan, Republic of Korea. The results demonstrate the high accuracy of the proposed HQGRU model. (c) 2023 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier B.V. on behalf of The Korean Institute of Communications and Information Sciences.

TI SPANSE: Combining sparsity with density for efficient one-time
   code-based digital signatures
SO JOURNAL OF ALGEBRA AND ITS APPLICATIONS
AB The use of codes defined by sparse characteristic matrices, like QC-LDPC and QC-MDPC codes, has become an established solution to design secure and efficient code-based public-key encryption schemes, as also witnessed by the ongoing NIST post-quantum cryptography standardization process. However, similar approaches have been less fortunate in the context of code-based digital signatures, since no secure and efficient signature scheme based on these codes is available to date. The main limitation of previous attempts in this line of research has been the use of sparse signatures, which produces some leakage of information about the private key. In this paper, we propose a new code-based digital signature scheme that overcomes such a problem by publishing signatures that are abnormally dense, rather than sparse. This eliminates the possibility of deducing information from the sparsity of signatures, and follows a recent trend in code-based cryptography exploiting the hardness of the decoding problem for large-weight vectors, instead of its classical version based on small-weight vectors. We focus on one-time use and provide a first parameterization of the new scheme, the main advantages of which are very fast signature generation and verification, and public keys that are not too large for a code-based signature scheme.

TI Prog-QAOA: Framework for resource-efficient quantum optimization through
   classical programs
SO QUANTUM
AB Current state-of-the-art quantum optimization algorithms require representing the original problem as a binary optimization problem, which is then converted into an equivalent cost Hamiltonian suitable for the quantum device. Implementing each term of the cost Hamiltonian separately often results in high redundancy, significantly increasing the resources required. Instead, we propose to design classical programs for computing the objective function and certifying the constraints, and later compile them to quantum circuits, eliminating the reliance on the binary optimization problem representation. This results in a new variant of the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA), which we name the Program-based QAOA (Prog-QAOA). We exploit this idea for optimization tasks like the Travelling Salesman Problem and Max-K-Cut and obtain circuits that are near-optimal with respect to all relevant cost measures, e.g., number of qubits, gates, and circuit depth. While we demonstrate the power of Prog-QAOA only for a particular set of paradigmatic problems, our approach is conveniently applicable to generic optimization problems.

TI Quantum Depletion of Superconductivity in 3D Diamond Nanowires
SO ADVANCED QUANTUM TECHNOLOGIES
AB Superconducting nanowires underpin the development of a variety of highly advanced quantum devices such as single-photon detectors and quantum circuits. In 1D superconducting nanowires, topological fluctuations of the superconducting order parameter, known as phase slips, severely influence the electrical transport. In 3D systems, however, phase-slip events are generally considered to be insignificant. Here, details on the observation of a reentrant resistive state in 3D superconducting diamond nanowires (DNWs) are reported. This exotic resistive state alters the trend of the superconducting transition with an abrupt change of the temperature and magnetic-field coefficients of resistivity and the current coefficient of voltage. This reentrant resistive state is interpreted as being a result of quantum phase slips in the bamboo-like DNWs consisting of multiple sequential grain-boundary-grain junctions. The results provide the first evidence that quantum phase slips can also play a crucial role in determining the electrical transport properties of 3D superconducting nanowires.

These encompass both variational states based on tensor or neural networks, and parameterized quantum circuits in variational quantum eigensolvers. However, self-consistent evaluation of the quality of variational wavefunctions is a notoriously hard task. Using a recently developed Hamiltonian reconstruction method, we propose a multi-faceted approach to evaluating the quality of neural-network based wavefunctions. Specifically, we consider convolutional neural network (CNN) and restricted Boltzmann machine (RBM) states trained on a square lattice spin-1/2 J(1) - J(2) Heisenberg model. We find that the reconstructed Hamiltonians are typically less frustrated, and have easy-axis anisotropy near the high frustration point. In addition, the reconstructed Hamiltonians suppress quantum fluctuations in the large J(2) limit. Our results highlight the critical importance of the wavefunction's symmetry. Moreover, the multi-faceted insight from the Hamiltonian reconstruction reveals that a variational wave function can fail to capture the true ground state through suppression of quantum fluctuations.

TI Quantum thermodynamics with a single superconducting vortex
SO SCIENCE ADVANCES
AB We demonstrate complete control over dynamics of a single superconducting vortex in a nanostructure, which we coin the Single Vortex Box. Our device allows us to trap the vortex in a field-cooled aluminum nanosquare and expel it on demand with a nanosecond pulse of electrical current. Using the time-resolving nanothermometry we measure 4 <middle dot> 10( - 19) joules as the amount of the dissipated heat in the elementary process of the single-vortex expulsion. Our experiment enlightens the thermodynamics of the absorption process in the superconducting nanowire single-photon detectors, in which vortices are perceived to be essential for a formation of a detectable hotspot. The demonstrated opportunity to manipulate a single superconducting vortex reliably in a confined geometry comprises a proof of concept of a nanoscale nonvolatile memory cell with subnanosecond write and read operations, which offers compatibility with quantum processors based either on superconducting qubits or on rapid single-flux quantum circuits.

TI Quantum Circuit Approximations and Entanglement Renormalization for the
   Dirac Field in 1+1 Dimensions
SO COMMUNICATIONS IN MATHEMATICAL PHYSICS
AB The multiscale entanglement renormalization ansatz describes quantum many-body states by a hierarchical entanglement structure organized by length scale. Numerically, it has been demonstrated to capture critical lattice models and the data of the corresponding conformal field theories with high accuracy. However, a rigorous understanding of its success and precise relation to the continuum is still lacking. To address this challenge, we provide an explicit construction of entanglement-renormalization quantum circuits that rigorously approximate correlation functions of the massless Dirac conformal field theory. We directly target the continuum theory: discreteness is introduced by our choice of how to probe the system, not by any underlying short-distance lattice regulator. To achieve this, we use multiresolution analysis from wavelet theory to obtain an approximation scheme and to implement entanglement renormalization in a natural way. This could be a starting point for constructing quantum circuit approximations for more general conformal field theories.

TI The Ponzano-Regge cylinder and propagator for 3d quantum gravity
SO CLASSICAL AND QUANTUM GRAVITY
AB We investigate the propagator of 3d quantum gravity, formulated as a discrete topological path integral. We define it as the Ponzano-Regge amplitude of the solid cylinder swept by a 2d disk evolving in time. Quantum states for a 2d disk live in the tensor products of N spins, where N is the number of holonomy insertions connecting to the disk boundary. We formulate the cylindric amplitude in terms of a transfer matrix and identify its eigen-modes in terms of spin recoupling. We show that the propagator distinguishes subspaces with different total recoupled spin. This may select the vanishing overall spin sector at late time depending on the chosen cylinder boundary data, leading to an emergent symmetry scenario in the continuum limit. We discuss applications to quantum circuits and the possibility of experimental simulations of this 3d quantum gravity propagator.

TI Markovian Quantum Neuroevolution for Machine Learning
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW APPLIED
AB Neuroevolution, a field that draws inspiration from the evolution of brains in nature, harnesses evolutionary algorithms to construct artificial neural networks. It bears a number of intriguing capabilities that are typically inaccessible to gradient-based approaches, including optimizing neural-network architectures, hyperparameters, and even learning the training rules. In this paper, we introduce a quantum neuroevolution algorithm that autonomously finds near-optimal quantum neural networks for different machine-learning tasks. In particular, we establish a one-to-one mapping between quantum circuits and directed graphs, and reduce the problem of finding the appropriate gate sequences to a task of searching suitable paths in the corresponding graph as a Markovian process. We benchmark the effectiveness of the introduced algorithm through concrete examples including classifications of real-life images and symmetry-protected topological states. Our results showcase the vast potential of neuroevolution algorithms in quantum architecture search, which would boost the exploration towards quantum-learning advantage with noisy intermediate-scale quantum devices.

TI Simulation of Linear Non-Hermitian Boundary-Value Problems with Quantum
   Singular-Value Transformation
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW APPLIED
AB We propose a quantum algorithm for simulating dissipative waves in inhomogeneous linear media as a boundary-value problem. Using the so-called quantum singular value transformation (QSVT), we construct a quantum circuit that models the propagation of electromagnetic waves in a one-dimensional system with outgoing boundary conditions. The corresponding measurement procedure is also discussed. Limitations of the QSVT algorithm are identified in connection with the large condition numbers that the dispersion matrices exhibit at weak dissipation.

TI Quarl: A Learning-Based Quantum Circuit Optimizer
SO PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACM ON PROGRAMMING LANGUAGES-PACMPL
AB Optimizing quantum circuits is challenging due to the very large search space of functionally equivalent circuits and the necessity of applying transformations that temporarily decrease performance to achieve a final performance improvement. This paper presents Quarl, a learning-based quantum circuit optimizer. Applying reinforcement learning (RL) to quantum circuit optimization raises two main challenges: the large and varying action space and the non-uniform state representation. Quarl addresses these issues with a novel neural architecture and RL-training procedure. Our neural architecture decomposes the action space into two parts and leverages graph neural networks in its state representation, both of which are guided by the intuition that optimization decisions can be mostly guided by local reasoning while allowing global circuit-wide reasoning. Our evaluation shows that Quarl significantly outperforms existing circuit optimizers on almost all benchmark circuits. Surprisingly, Quarl can learn to perform rotation merging-a complex, non-local circuit optimization implemented as a separate pass in existing optimizers.

TI Improved graph formalism for quantum circuit simulation
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Improving the simulation of quantum circuits on classical computers is important for understanding quantum advantage and increasing development speed. In this paper, we explore a way to express stabilizer states and further improve the speed of simulating stabilizer circuits with a current existing approach. First, we discover a unique and elegant canonical form for stabilizer states based on graph states to better represent stabilizer states and show how to efficiently simplify stabilizer states to canonical form. Second, we develop an improved algorithm for graph state stabilizer simulation and establish limitations on reducing the quadratic runtime of applying controlled Pauli Z gates. We do so by creating a simpler formula for combining two Pauli-related stabilizer states into one. Third, to better understand the linear dependence of stabilizer states, we characterize all linearly dependent triplets, revealing symmetries in the inner products. Using our controlled Pauli Z algorithm, we improve runtime for inner product computation from O(n(3)) to O(nd(2)), where d is the maximum degree of the graph encountered during the calculation.

TI Efficient verification of anticoncentrated quantum states
SO NPJ QUANTUM INFORMATION
AB I present a method for estimating the fidelity F(mu, tau) between a preparable quantum state mu and a classically specified pure target state tau = vertical bar tau tau vertical bar, using simple quantum circuits and on-the-fly classical calculation (or lookup) of selected amplitudes of vertical bar tau . The method is sample efficient for anticoncentrated states (including many states that are hard to simulate classically), with approximate cost 4 epsilon(-2)(1 - F)dp(coll) where. is the desired precision of the estimate, d is the dimension of the Hilbert space, and p(coll) is the collision probability of the target distribution. This scaling is exponentially better than that of any method based on classical sampling. I also present a more sophisticated version of the method that uses any efficiently preparable and well-characterized quantum state as an importance sampler to further reduce the number of copies of mu needed. Though some challenges remain, this work takes a significant step toward scalable verification of complex states produced by quantum processors.

TI Spectral Gap Optimization for Enhanced Adiabatic State Preparation
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB The preparation of nontrivial states is crucial to the study of quantum many-body physics. Such states can be prepared with adiabatic quantum algorithms, which are restricted by the minimum spectral gap along the path. In this Letter, we propose an efficient method to adiabatically prepare tensor network states (TNSs). We maximize the spectral gap leveraging degrees of freedom in the parent Hamiltonian construction. We demonstrate this efficient adiabatic algorithm for preparing TNSs, through examples of random TNSs in one dimension, AKLT (Affleck-Kennedy-Lieb-Tasaki), and GHZ states. The Hamiltonian optimization applies to both injective and non-injective tensors, in the latter case by exploiting symmetries present in the tensors.

   At the same time, in the general setting, the picture is different a little. Classical query complexity is theta(n), and quantum query complexity is theta* (root n). So, we obtain polynomial speed-up for both cases (general and property testing).

TI Linear Combination of Hamiltonian Simulation for Nonunitary Dynamics

SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB We propose a simple method for simulating a general class of nonunitary dynamics as a linear combination of Hamiltonian simulation (LCHS) problems. LCHS does not rely on converting the problem into a dilated linear system problem or on the spectral mapping theorem. The latter is the mathematical foundation of many quantum algorithms for solving a wide variety of tasks involving nonunitary processes, such as the quantum singular value transformation. The LCHS method can achieve optimal cost in terms of state preparation. We also demonstrate an application for open quantum dynamics simulation using the complex absorbing potential method with near-optimal dependence on all parameters.

TI Propagation velocity measurements of substrate phonon bursts using MKIDs
   for superconducting circuits
SO APPLIED PHYSICS LETTERS
AB High-energy bursts in superconducting quantum circuits from various radiation sources have recently become a practical concern due to induced errors and their propagation in the chip. The speed and distance of these disturbances have practical implications. We used a linear array of multiplexed MKIDs on a single silicon chip to measure the propagation velocity of a localized high-energy burst, introduced by driving a normal metal-insulator-superconductor (NIS) junction. We observed a reduction in the apparent propagation velocity with NIS power, which is due to the combined effect of reduced phonon flux with distance and the existence of a minimum detectable QP density in the MKIDs. A simple theoretical model is fitted to extract the longitudinal phonon velocity in the substrate and the conversion efficiency of phonons to QPs in the superconductor.(c) 2024 Author(s).

AB Secure computation is a cornerstone of modern cryptography and a rich body of research is devoted to understanding its round complexity. In this work, we consider two-party computation (2PC) protocols (where both parties receive output) that remain secure in the realistic setting where many instances of the protocol are executed in parallel (concurrent security). We obtain a two-round concurrent-secure 2PC protocol based on a single, standard, post-quantum assumption: The subexponential hardness of the learning-with-errors (LWE) problem. Our protocol is in the plain model, i.e., it has no trusted setup, and it is secure in the super-polynomial simulation framework of Pass (EUROCRYPT 2003). Since two rounds are minimal for (concurrent) 2PC, this work resolves the round complexity of concurrent 2PC from standard assumptions.
   As immediate applications, our work establishes feasibility results for interesting cryptographic primitives, such as the first two-round password authentication key exchange (PAKE) protocol in the plain model and the first two-round concurrent secure computation protocol for quantum circuits (2PQC).

TI Approximate t-Designs in Generic Circuit Architectures
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB Unitary t-designs are distributions on the unitary group whose first t moments appear maximally random. Previous work has established several upper bounds on the depths at which certain specific random quantum circuit ensembles approximate t-designs. Here we show that these bounds can be extended to any fixed architecture of Haar-random two-site gates. This is accomplished by relating the spectral gaps of such architectures to those of one-dimensional brickwork architectures. Our bound depends on the details of the architecture only via the typical number of layers needed for a block of the circuit to form a connected graph over the sites. When this quantity is bounded, the circuit forms an approximate tdesign in at most linear depth. We give numerical evidence for a stronger bound that depends only on the number of connected blocks into which the architecture can be divided. We also give an implicit bound for nondeterministic architectures in terms of properties of the corresponding distribution over fixed architectures.

TI Towards High Performance QNNs via Distribution-Based CNOT Gate Reduction
SO ACM TRANSACTIONS ON ARCHITECTURE AND CODE OPTIMIZATION
AB Quantum Neural Networks (QNNs) are one of the most promising applications that can be implemented on NISQ-era quantum computers. In this study, we observe that QNNs often suffer from gate redundancy, which hugely declines the performance and accuracy of the network. Even state-of-the-art architecture search techniques like QuantumNAS do not completely alleviate this problem. Especially, we find that CNOT gates are major contributors to the execution delay and noise in quantum circuits, and there are many redundant CNOT gates in the QNN post-training. This motivates us to propose a novel distribution-based greedy-search circuit optimization technique that can be employed after the completion of the training process. Our technique significantly reduces the number of CNOT gates in QNNs without affecting the accuracy of the network. With this technique, we have achieved an average of 3x improvement in execution time while reaching a maximum of 12.4x improvement.

TI Embedding cyclic information-theoretic structures in acyclic
   space-times: No-go results for indefinite causality
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB The notions of causality adopted within the quantum information and space-time physics communities are distinct. Although experience tells us that these notions play together in a compatible manner in physical experiments, their general interplay is little understood in theory. Therefore we develop a theoretical framework that connects the two causality notions, while also clearly distinguishing them. The framework describes a composition of quantum operations through feedback loops, and the embedding of the resulting, possibly cyclic information-theoretic structure in an acyclic space-time structure. Relativistic causality (which forbids superluminal communication) then follows as a graph-theoretic compatibility condition between the two structures. Demonstrating that indefinite causal order (ICO) processes, widely studied in the quantum information community, can be formulated within our framework, we shed light on the links between indefinite and cyclic causality, and on questions regarding their physicality. In particular, there are several experiments that claim to implement ICO processes in Minkowski space-time, presenting an apparent theoretical paradox: how can an indefinite information-theoretic causal structure be consistent with a definite space-time structure? We address this through no-go theorems, showing that as a consequence of relativistic causality, (a) realizations of ICO processes necessarily involve the nonlocalization of systems in space-time and (b) will nevertheless admit an explanation in terms of a definite and acyclic causal order process, at a more fine-grained level. These results are made possible by introducing the concept of fine-graining that allows causal structures to be analyzed at different levels of detail. This fully resolves the apparent paradox and bears implications for the physical interpretation of ICO experiments. Our work also sheds light on the limits of quantum information processing in space-time and offers concrete insights on the operational meaning of indefinite causality, both within and beyond the context of a fixed space-time.

TI Quantum semi-supervised generative adversarial network for enhanced data
   classification
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB In this paper, we propose the quantum semi-supervised generative adversarial network (qSGAN). The system is composed of a quantum generator and a classical discriminator/classifier (D/C). The goal is to train both the generator and the D/C, so that the latter may get a high classification accuracy for a given dataset. Hence the qSGAN needs neither any data loading nor to generate a pure quantum state, implying that qSGAN is much easier to implement than many existing quantum algorithms. Also the generator can serve as a stronger adversary than a classical one thanks to its rich expressibility, and it is expected to be robust against noise. These advantages are demonstrated in a numerical simulation.

TI Gauging modulated symmetries: Kramers-Wannier dualities and
   non-invertible reflections
SO SCIPOST PHYSICS
AB Modulated symmetries are internal symmetries that act in a non-uniform, spatially modulated way and are generalizations of, for example, dipole symmetries. In this paper, we systematically study the gauging of finite Abelian modulated symmetries in 1 + 1 dimensions. Working with local Hamiltonians of spin chains, we explore the dual symmetries after gauging and their potential new spatial modulations. We establish sufficient conditions for the existence of an isomorphism between the modulated symmetries and their dual, naturally implemented by lattice reflections. For instance, in systems of prime qudits, translation invariance guarantees this isomorphism. For non-prime qudits, we show using techniques from ring theory that this isomorphism can also exist, although it is not guaranteed by lattice translation symmetry alone. From this isomorphism, we identify new Kramers-Wannier dualities and construct related non-invertible reflection symmetry operators using sequential quantum circuits. Notably, this non-invertible reflection symmetry exists even when the system lacks ordinary reflection symmetry. Throughout the paper, we illustrate these results using various simple toy models.

TI Parent Hamiltonian as a benchmark problem for variational quantum
   eigensolvers
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB The variational quantum eigensolver (VQE), which has attracted attention as a promising application of noisy intermediate-scale quantum devices, finds a ground state of a given Hamiltonian by variationally optimizing the parameters of quantum circuits called Ans??tze. Since the difficulty of the optimization depends on the complexity of the problem Hamiltonian and the structure of the Ans??tze, it has been difficult to systematically analyze the performance of optimizers for the VQE. To resolve this problem, we propose a technique to construct a benchmark problem whose ground state is guaranteed to be achievable with a given Ansatz by using the idea of a parent Hamiltonian of a low-depth parametrized quantum circuit. We compare the convergence of several optimizers by varying the distance of the initial parameters from the solution and find that the converged energies showed a thresholdlike behavior depending on the distance. This work provides a systematic way to analyze optimizers for the VQE and contribute to the design of the Ansatz and its initial parameters.

TI Natural evolution strategies and variational Monte Carlo
SO MACHINE LEARNING-SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB A notion of quantum natural evolution strategies is introduced, which provides a geometric synthesis of a number of known quantum/classical algorithms for performing classical black-box optimization. The recent work of Gomes et al (2019 arXiv:1910.10675) on heuristic combinatorial optimization using neural quantum states is pedagogically reviewed in this context, emphasizing the connection with natural evolution strategies (NES). The algorithmic framework is illustrated for approximate combinatorial optimization problems, and a systematic strategy is found for improving the approximation ratios. In particular, it is found that NES can achieve approximation ratios competitive with widely used heuristic algorithms for Max-Cut, at the expense of increased computation time.

TI Highly-entangled, highly-doped states that are efficiently cross-device
   verifiable
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB In this paper, we introduce a class of highly entangled real quantum states that cannot be approximated by circuits with log-many non-Clifford gates and prove that Bell sampling enables efficient cross-device verification (or distributed inner product estimation) for these states. That is, two remote parties can estimate the inner product tr(rho sigma ), each having black-box access to copies of a state rho (or respectively sigma) in this class. This is significant because it is clear that this task can be achieved in those cases (such as low entanglement or low non-Clifford gate count) where one can independently learn efficient classical descriptions of each state using established techniques and share the description to compute the overlap. Instead, our results demonstrate that this is possible even in more complex scenarios where these "learn and share" methods are insufficient. Our proposal is scalable, as it just requires a number of two-copy Bell measurements and single-copy Pauli measurements that grows polynomially with both the number of qubits and the desired inverse error, and can be implemented in the near term. Moreover, the required number of samples can be efficiently experimentally determined by the parties in advance, and our findings are robust against preparation errors. We anticipate that these results could have applications in quantum cryptography and verification.

TI Efficient Continuous Key Agreement With Reduced Bandwidth From a
   Decomposable KEM
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB Continuous Key Agreement (CKA) is a two-party protocol used in double-ratchet protocols such as signal. It enables continuous and synchronous key distribution that generates a fresh key to encrypt each transaction in messenger apps. It guarantees forward secrecy and post-compromise security. In recent years, the post-quantum versions of the double-ratchet protocol and CKA have been intensively studied. In Eurocrypt 2019, Alwen et al. suggest a generic construction of CKA based on the Key Encapsulation Mechanism (KEM), achieving the post-quantum CKA from post-quantum KEMs. They also mention that the bandwidth can be reduced by half using ElGamal KEM. In this paper, we generalize this idea by defining a new primitive called Decomposable Key Encapsulation Mechanism (DKEM) and instantiate it with the promising lattice-based schemes such as $\mathsf {CRYSTALS{-}KYBER}$ and $\mathsf {SABER}$ . Using DKEM instantiated with $\mathsf {CRYSTALS{-}KYBER}$ (resp. $\mathsf {SABER}$ ) and security category 1 parameters, our CKA achieves 51% (resp. 48%) reduced bandwidths compared to the generic construction from KEM. We also implement our CKA on both Intel Xeon E5-1650 v3 and ARMv8 Cortex-A72 processors, respectively, and show that the performance of sender algorithm is improved from 79.29 to 96.94% (resp. from 74.64 to 91.04%) when instantiated with $\mathsf {CRYSTALS{-}KYBER}$ (resp. $\mathsf {SABER}$ ).

TI All non-Gaussian states are advantageous for channel discrimination:
   robustness of non-convex continuous variable quantum resources
SO NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB Which quantum phenomena are advantageous for information processing tasks? By classifying quantum states and operations as resourceful versus non-resourceful, or free, the mathematical formalism of quantum resource theories helps to address such questions. For the task of discriminating channels applied to a probe state, it has been shown that under certain conditions-namely, the set of free states being convex in any dimension or possibly non-convex but finite dimensional-every resourceful probe state can provide an advantage, quantified by a resource monotone known as generalized robustness. In this work, bypassing the limitations of previous studies, we define the generalized robustness for an arbitrary resource theory and show that it admits two operational interpretations. Firstly, it provides an upper bound on the maximal advantage in channel discrimination tasks implemented on multiple copies of the probe states. Secondly, in many physically relevant theories, it quantifies the advantage in single-copy channel discrimination tasks in a worst case scenario. We further present a general construction of multi-copy resource witnesses and provide practical methods to bound the generalized robustness in experiments. Finally, we apply our results to a key case study in continuous variable quantum information: the resource theory of non-Gaussianity. This theory is naturally defined by a set of free states (Gaussian states) that is non-convex and infinite-dimensional. Our work then shows conclusively that all non-Gaussian states can provide an advantage in some channel discrimination task, even those that are simply mixtures of Gaussian states and are typically disregarded for other quantum information tasks. To illustrate our findings, we provide exact formulas for the robustness of non-Gaussianity of Fock states, along with an analysis of the robustness for a family of non-Gaussian states within the convex hull of Gaussian states.

TI Down-converted photon pairs in a high-Q silicon nitride
   microresonator
SO NATURE
AB Entangled photon pairs from spontaneous parametric down-conversion (SPDC)1 are central to many quantum applications2, 3, 4, 5-6. SPDC is typically performed in non-centrosymmetric systems7 with an inherent second-order nonlinearity (chi(2))8, 9-10. We demonstrate strong narrowband SPDC with an on-chip rate of 0.8 million pairs per second in Si3N4. Si3N4 is the pre-eminent material for photonic integration and also exhibits the lowest waveguide loss (which is essential for integrated quantum circuits). However, being amorphous, silicon nitride lacks an intrinsic chi(2), which limits its role in photonic quantum devices. We enabled SPDC in Si3N4 by combining strong light-field enhancement inside a high optical Q-factor microcavity with an optically induced space-charge field. We present narrowband photon pairs with a high spectral brightness. The quantum nature of the down-converted photon pairs is verified through coincidence measurements. This light source, based on Si3N4 integrated photonics technology, unlocks new avenues for quantum systems on a chip.

TI Strong spin-orbit coupling inducing Autler-Townes effect in lead halide
   perovskite nanocrystals
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Manipulation of excitons via coherent light-matter interaction is a promising approach for quantum state engineering and ultrafast optical modulation. Various excitation pathways in the excitonic multilevel systems provide controllability more efficient than that in the two-level system. However, these control schemes have been restricted to limited control-light wavelengths and cryogenic temperatures. Here, we report that lead halide perovskites can lift these restrictions owing to their multiband structure induced by strong spin-orbit coupling. Using CsPbBr3 perovskite nanocrystals, we observe an anomalous enhancement of the exciton energy shift at room temperature with increasing control-light wavelength from the visible to near-infrared region. The enhancement occurs because the interconduction band transitions between spin-orbit split states have large dipole moments and induce a crossover from the two-level optical Stark effect to the three-level Autler-Townes effect. Our finding establishes a basis for efficient coherent optical manipulation of excitons utilizing energy states with large spin-orbit splitting. Here, Yumoto et al. demonstrate that for a halide perovskite with large spin-orbit splitting the optical Stark effect can give way to a three level Autler-Townes effect in the near-infrared region. The multiband nature of the effect potentially allows for further optical control over quantum states.
