TI Approximate amplitude encoding in shallow parameterized quantum circuits
   and its application to financial market indicators
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Efficient methods for loading given classical data into quantum circuits are essential for various quantum algorithms. In this paper, we propose an algorithm called Approximate Amplitude Encoding that can effectively load all the components of a given real-valued data vector into the amplitude of quantum state, while the previous proposal can load only the absolute values of those components. The key of our algorithm is to variationally train a shallow parameterized quantum circuit, using the results of two types of measurement: the standard computational-basis measurement plus the measurement in the Hadamard-transformed basis, introduced in order to handle the sign of the data components. The variational algorithm changes the circuit parameters so as to minimize the sum of two costs corresponding to those two measurement basis, both of which are given by the efficiently computable maximum mean discrepancy. We also consider the problem of constructing the singular value decomposition entropy via the stock market data set to give a financial market indicator; a quantum algorithm (the variational singular value decomposition algorithm) is known to produce a solution faster than classical, which yet requires the sign-dependent amplitude encoding. We demonstrate, with an in-depth numerical analysis, that our algorithm realizes loading of time series of real stock prices on quantum state with small approximation error, and thereby it enables constructing an indicator of the financial market based on the stock prices.

TI Structure and Formation Mechanisms in Tantalum and Niobium Oxides in
   Superconducting Quantum Circuits
SO ACS NANO
AB Improving the qubit's lifetime (T1) is crucial for fault-tolerant quantum computing. Recent advancements have shown that replacing niobium (Nb) with tantalum (Ta) as the base metal significantly increases T1, likely due to a less lossy native surface oxide. However, understanding the formation mechanism and nature of both surface oxides is still limited. Using aberration-corrected transmission electron microscopy and electron energy loss spectroscopy, we found that Ta surface oxide has fewer suboxides than Nb oxide. We observed an abrupt oxidation state transition from Ta2O5 to Ta, as opposed to the gradual shift from Nb2O5, NbO2, and NbO to Nb, consistent with thermodynamic modeling. Additionally, amorphous Ta2O5 exhibits a closer-to-crystalline bonding nature than Nb2O5, potentially hindering H atomic diffusion toward the oxide/metal interface. Finally, we propose a loss mechanism arising from the transition between two states within the distorted octahedron in an amorphous structure, potentially causing two-level system loss. Our findings offer a deeper understanding of the differences between native amorphous Ta and Nb oxides, providing valuable insights for advancing superconducting qubits through surface oxide engineering.

TI Flavor patterns of fundamental particles from quantum entanglement?
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW D
AB The Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa (CKM) matrix, which controls flavor mixing between the three generations of quark fermions, is a key input to the standard model of particle physics. In this paper, we identify a surprising connection between quantum entanglement and the degree of quark mixing. Focusing on a specific limit of 2 -> 2 quark scattering mediated by electroweak bosons, we find that the quantum entanglement generated by scattering is minimized when the CKM matrix is almost (but not exactly) diagonal, in qualitative agreement with observation. With the discovery of neutrino masses and mixings, additional angles are needed to parametrize the Pontecorvo-Maki-Nakagawa-Sakata (PMNS) matrix in the lepton sector. Applying the same logic, we find that quantum entanglement is minimized when the PMNS matrix features two large angles and a smaller one, again in qualitative agreement with observation, plus a hint for suppressed CP violation. We speculate on the (unlikely but tantalizing) possibility that minimization of quantum entanglement might be a fundamental principle that determines particle physics input parameters.

TI Chemically motivated simulation problems are efficiently solvable on a
   quantum computer
SO DIGITAL DISCOVERY
AB Simulating chemical systems is highly sought after and computationally challenging, as the number of degrees of freedom increases exponentially with the size of the system. Quantum computers have been proposed as a computational means to overcome this bottleneck, thanks to their capability of representing this amount of information efficiently. Most efforts so far have been centered around determining the ground states of chemical systems. However, hardness results and the lack of theoretical guarantees for efficient heuristics for initial-state generation shed doubt on the feasibility. Here, we propose a heuristically guided approach that is based on inherently efficient routines to solve chemical simulation problems, requiring quantum circuits of size scaling polynomially in relevant system parameters. If a set of assumptions can be satisfied, our approach finds good initial states for dynamics simulation by assembling them in a scattering tree. In particular, we investigate a scattering-based state preparation approach within the context of mergo-association. We discuss a variety of quantities of chemical interest that can be measured after the quantum simulation of a process, e.g., a reaction, following its corresponding initial state preparation.

TI Improving Threshold for Fault-Tolerant Color-Code Quantum Computing by
   Flagged Weight Optimization
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB Color codes are promising quantum error-correction (QEC) codes because they have an advantage over surface codes in that all Clifford gates can be implemented transversally. However, the thresholds of color codes under circuit-level noise are relatively low, mainly because measurements of their high-weight stabilizer generators cause an increase in the circuit depth and, thus, substantial errors are introduced. This makes color codes not the best candidate for fault-tolerant quantum computing. Here, we propose a method to suppress the impact of such errors by optimizing weights of decoders using conditional error probabilities conditioned on the measurement outcomes of flag qubits. In numerical simulations, we improve the threshold of the (4.8.8) color code under circuit-level noise from 0.14% to around 0.27%, which is calculated by using an integer programming decoder. Furthermore, in the (6.6.6) color code, we achieve a circuit-level threshold of around 0.36%, which is almost the same value as the highest value in the previous studies employing the same noise model. In both cases, the effective code distance is also improved compared to a conventional method that uses a single ancilla qubit for each stabilizer measurement. Thereby, the achieved logical error rates at low physical error rates are almost one order of magnitude lower than those of the conventional method with the same code distance. Even when compared to the single-ancilla method with a higher code distance, considering the increased number of qubits used in our method, we achieve lower logical error rates in most cases. This method can also be applied to other weight-based decoders, making the color codes more promising as candidates for the experimental implementation of QEC. Furthermore, one can utilize this approach to improve a threshold of wider classes of QEC codes, such as high-rate quantum low-density parity-check codes.

AB A silicon quantum photonic circuit was proposed and realized for the generation and the dynamic manipulation of telecom-band frequency-degenerate polarization entangled Bell states. Frequency degenerate biphoton states were generated in four silicon waveguides by spontaneous four wave mixing. They were transformed to polarization entangled Bell states through on-chip quantum interference and quantum superposition, and then coupled to optical fibers. The demonstrated by two-photon interference under two non-orthogonal polarization bases. The output state could be dynamically switched between two Bell states, which was demonstrated by the simplified Bell state measurement. The experiment results indicated that the dynamic control.

AB Misconceptions about (post) quantum cryptography among security experts could endanger the successful and appropriate build-up of defenses against attacks through quantum computers. We suspect that accurate knowledge about those quantum topics is not widely available yet. In the first, locally limited, exploratory study, we conducted n = 19 interviews with security experts & students with varying experiences to explore their knowledge and attitude towards (post) quantum cryptography. Through qualitative content analysis, we identified several quantum misconceptions, with overestimating or underestimating, confusing topics or principles, and lack of context or knowledge as general categories. The participants also showed general mistrust of the institutions, which led to the buildup of quantum computers. The identified patterns can help address (post) misconceptions about quantum cryptography in security education.

AB It is well known that the waveguide beam splitter can be used as a source for the quantum entanglement of photons. The analysis of such quantum entanglement is a difficult problem even for monochromatic photons, since the system under study is multiparametric. This paper will show that quantum entanglement can be represented in a simple form not only for monochromatic photons but also for non-monochromatic ones. It will be shown that quantum entanglement for non-monochromatic photons can be very different from monochromatic photons, which can be used to create large quantum entanglement.

TI QEnclave - A practical solution for secure quantum cloud computing
SO NPJ QUANTUM INFORMATION
AB We introduce a secure hardware device named a QEnclave that can secure the remote execution of quantum operations while only using classical controls. This device extends to quantum computing from the classical concept of a secure enclave that isolates a computation from its environment to provide privacy and tamper-resistance. Remarkably, our QEnclave only performs single qubit rotations but can nevertheless be used to secure an arbitrary quantum computation even if the qubit source is controlled by an adversary. More precisely, by attaching a QEnclave to a quantum computer, a remote client controlling the QEnclave can securely delegate its computation to the server solely using classical communication. We investigate the security of our QEnclave by modeling it as an ideal functionality named remote state rotation (RSR). We show that this resource, similar to the previously introduced functionality of remote state preparation, allows blind delegated quantum computing with perfect security. Our proof under the Abstract Cryptography framework shows the construction of remote state preparation from remote state rotation while preserving security. An immediate consequence is the weakening of the requirements for blind delegated computation. While previous delegated protocols relied on a client that can either generate or measure quantum states, we show that this same functionality can be achieved with a client that only transforms quantum states without generating or measuring them.

TI Finding the disjointness of stabilizer codes is NP-complete
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB The disjointness of a stabilizer code is a quantity used to constrain the level of the logical Clifford hierarchy attainable by transversal gates and constant-depth quantum circuits. We show that for any positive integer constant c, the problem of calculating the c-disjointness, or even approximating it to within a constant multiplicative factor, is NP-complete. We provide bounds on the disjointness for various code families, including the Calderbank-Shor-Steane codes, concatenated codes, and hypergraph product codes. We also describe numerical methods of finding the disjointness, which can be readily used to rule out the existence of any transversal gate implementing some non-Clifford logical operation in small stabilizer codes. Our results indicate that finding fault-tolerant logical gates for generic quantum error-correcting codes is a computationally challenging task.

TI In-Field Quantum-Protected Control-Based Key Distribution with a Lossy
   Urban Fiber Link
SO QUANTUM REPORTS
AB Quantum cryptography protocols offering unconditional protection open great rout to full information security in quantum era. Yet, implementing these protocols using the existing fiber networks remains challenging due to high signal losses reducing the efficiency of these protocols to zero. The recently proposed quantum-protected control-based key distribution (QCKD) addresses this issue by physically controlling interceptable losses and ensuring that leaked quantum states remain non-orthogonal. Here, we present the first in-field development and demonstration of the QCKD over an urban fiber link characterized by substantial losses. Using information-theoretic considerations, we configure the system ensuring security and investigate the interplay between line losses and secret key rates. As an example, we present calculation for the communication distance 4 km, QCKD rate 490 bits per second, and find that the corresponding system's total loss is about 1.628 decibels. Our results, backed by the statistical analysis of the secret key, confirm QCKD's robustness under real-world conditions, and establish it as a practical solution for quantum-safe communications over existing fiber infrastructures.

TI Application of machine learning in optimal allocation of quantum
   communication resources
SO ACTA PHYSICA SINICA
AB In the application of quantum communication networks, it is an important task to realize the optimal allocation of resources according to the current situation. For example, We need to select the optimal quantum key distribution (QKD) protocol and parameters. Traditionally, the most commonly implemented method is the local search algorithm (LSA), which costs a lot of resources. Here in this work, we propose a machine learning based scheme, in which the regression machine learning is used to simultaneously select the optimal protocol and corresponding parameters. In addition, we make comparisons among a few machine learning models including random forest (RF), K-nearest neighbor (KNN) and logistic regression. Simulation results show that the new scheme takes much less time than the LSA scheme, and the RF achieves the best performance. In addition, through the RF residual analysis, we find that the machine learning scheme has good robustness. In conclusion, this work may play an important role in promoting the practical application of quantum communication networks.

TI Silicon spin qubit noise characterization using real-time feedback
   protocols and wavelet analysis
SO APPLIED PHYSICS LETTERS
AB Recently, several groups have demonstrated two-qubit gate fidelities in semiconductor spin qubit systems above 99%. Achieving this regime of fault-tolerant compatible high fidelities is nontrivial and requires exquisite stability and precise control over the different qubit parameters over an extended period of time. This motivates the search for the efficient calibration of qubit control parameters against different sources of micro- and macroscopic noise and methods for noise analysis. Here, we present several single- and two-qubit parameter feedback protocols, optimized for and implemented in the state-of-the-art fast field-programmable gate array hardware. Furthermore, we present a wavelet-based analysis on feedback data collected over a similar to 9 h time frame to gain insight into the different sources of noise in the system. Scalable feedback is an outstanding challenge and the presented implementation and analysis gives insight into the benefits and drawbacks of qubit parameter feedback, as feedback related overhead increases. This work demonstrates a pathway toward robust qubit parameter feedback and systematic noise analysis, crucial for mitigation strategies toward systematic high-fidelity qubit operation compatible with quantum error correction protocols.

AB We introduce an optimisation method for variational quantum algorithms and experimentally demonstrate a 100-fold improvement in efficiency compared to naive implementations. The effectiveness of our approach is shown by obtaining multi-dimensional energy surfaces for small molecules and a spin model. Our method solves related variational problems in parallel by exploiting the global nature of Bayesian optimisation and sharing information between different optimisers. Parallelisation makes our method ideally suited to the next generation of variational problems with many physical degrees of freedom. This addresses a key challenge in scaling-up quantum algorithms towards demonstrating quantum advantage for problems of real-world interest.

TI Quantum Computing in Spin-Adapted Representations for Efficient
   Simulations
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB Exploiting inherent symmetries is a common and effective approach to speed up the simulation of quantum systems. However, efficiently accounting for non-Abelian symmetries, such as the global SU(2) spin symmetry, remains a major challenge. In fact, expressing total-spin eigenstates in terms of the computational basis can require an exponentially large number of coefficients. In this work, we introduce a novel formalism for designing quantum algorithms directly in an eigenbasis of the total-spin operator. Our strategy relies on the symmetric group approach in conjunction with a truncation scheme for the internal degrees of freedom of total-spin eigenstates. For the case of the antiferromagnetic Heisenberg model, we show that this formalism yields a hierarchy of spin-adapted Hamiltonians, for each truncation threshold, whose ground-state energy and wave function quickly converge to their exact counterparts, calculated on the full model. These truncated Hamiltonians can be encoded with sparse and local qubit Hamiltonians that are suitable for quantum simulations. We demonstrate this by developing a state-preparation schedule to construct shallow quantum-circuit approximations, expressed in a total-spin eigenbasis, for the ground states of the Heisenberg Hamiltonian in different symmetry sectors.

TI Survey on Redundancy Based-Fault tolerance methods for Processors and
   Hardware accelerators - Trends in Quantum Computing, Heterogeneous
   Systems and Reliability
SO ACM COMPUTING SURVEYS
AB Rapid progress in CMOS technology since the late 1990s has increased the vulnerability of processors toward faults. Subsequently, the focus of computer architects has shifted toward designing fault-tolerance methods for processor architectures. Concurrently, chip designers have encountered high-order challenges for designing fault-tolerant processor architectures. For processor cores, redundancy-based fault-tolerance methods for fault detection at the core, micro-architectural, thread, and software levels are discussed. Similar applicable redundancy-based fault-tolerance methods for cache memory and hardware accelerators are also presented in the article. Recent trends in fault-tolerant quantum computing and quantum error correction are also discussed. The classification of state-of-the-art techniques presented will help researchers organize their work on established lines.

TI Teleportation of unknown states of a qubit and a single-mode field in
   strong coupling regime without Bell-state measurement
SO COMMUNICATIONS IN THEORETICAL PHYSICS
AB In this paper, we develop the teleportation scheme in [Zheng in Phys Rev A 69, 064302, 2004], in the sense that, we work in the strong atom-field coupling regime wherein the rotating wave approximation (RWA) is no longer valid. To achieve the purpose, a scheme consisting of a qubit interacting with a single-mode quantized field is described via the Rabi model (counter rotation terms are taken into account). Our first aim is to teleport an unknown atomic state of a qubit (which interacts with the quantized field in a cavity) to a second qubit (exists in another distant cavity field), beyond the RWA and without the Bell-state measurement method. In the continuation, in a similar way, we teleport an unknown state of a single-mode field too. In fact, it is shown that, in this regime, after applying some particular conditions, containing the interaction time of atom-field in the cavities, adjusting the involved frequencies, as well as the atom-field coupling in the model, if a proper measurement is performed on the state of the first qubit (the related field in the cavity), the unknown states of the qubit (field) can be teleported from the first qubit (cavity field) to the second qubit (cavity field), appropriately. We show that in both considered cases, the teleportation protocol is successfully performed with the maximum possible fidelity, 1, and the acceptable success probability, 0.25.

   implementation of quantum lattice Boltzmann method
SO ACM TRANSACTIONS ON QUANTUM COMPUTING
AB We explore the use of classical programming techniques in implementing the quantum lattice Boltzmann method in the Intel Quantum SDK-a software tool for quantum circuit creation and execution on Intel quantum hardware. As hardware access is limited, we use the state vector simulator provided by the SDK. The novelty of this work lies in leveraging classical techniques for the implementation of quantum algorithms. We emphasize the refinement of algorithm implementation and devise strategies to enhance quantum circuits for better control over problem variables. To this end, we adopt classical principles such as modularization, which allows for systematic and controlled execution of complex algorithms. Furthermore, we discuss how the same implementation could be expanded from state vector simulations to execution on quantum hardware with minor adjustments in these configurations.

AB Quantum technology has garnered considerable attention for its transformative potential across various industries since the early 2000s, precipitating a surge in quantum start-ups and substantial investments worldwide. However, comprehensive research on quantum technology in industries, particularly start-ups in the quantum field, remains limited. This study analyzes a dataset of 1,200 quantum start-ups from 40 countries, specifically focusing on 430 notable active start-ups. The analysis provides a thorough perspective on the industry's progress, including trends in growth, geographical distribution, industry categorization, and investment patterns. The study categorizes start-ups into five domains: quantum computing, communication, sensing, hardware, and software. The analysis further captures the progress made by ten prominent quantum start-ups, six major technology companies, and quantum consortia regarding their technological innovations and strategic partnerships. We provide a comparative analysis of prior research to identify current conditions and future implications validated by notable studies, focusing on key parameters such as dataset scope, geographical distribution, growth trends, industry categorization, taxonomy, main interests in quantum fields, key players, and ecosystem identification. This approach underscores the dynamic growth of the quantum industry, which will drive future advancements.

TI Quantum simulation for time-dependent Hamiltonians-with applications to
   non-autonomous ordinary and partial differential equations
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICS A-MATHEMATICAL AND THEORETICAL
AB Non-autonomous dynamical systems appear in a very wide range of interesting applications, both in classical and quantum dynamics, where in the latter case, it corresponds to having a time-dependent Hamiltonian. Designing quantum algorithms for time-dependent Hamiltonian is generally much more complicated than time-independent Hamiltonian problems, due to the challenge in handling the time-ordering; moreover, almost all existing such algorithms are developed for qubit-based quantum devices. Here we propose an alternative formalism based on Sambe-Howland's clock that turns any non-autonomous unitary dynamical system into an autonomous unitary system, i.e. quantum system with a time-independent Hamiltonian, in one higher dimension, while keeping time continuous. This makes the simulation with time-dependent Hamiltonians not much more difficult than that of time-independent Hamiltonians, and can also be framed in terms of an analogue quantum system evolving continuously in time. We show how our new quantum protocol for time-dependent Hamiltonians can be performed in a resource-efficient way and without measurements, and can be made possible on either continuous-variable, qubit or hybrid systems. Combined with a technique called Schr & ouml;dingerisation, this dilation technique can be applied to the quantum simulation of any linear ODEs and PDEs, and nonlinear ODEs and certain nonlinear PDEs, with time-dependent coefficients.

TI Group-Invariant Quantum Machine Learning
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB Quantum machine learning (QML) models are aimed at learning from data encoded in quantum states. Recently, it has been shown that models with little to no inductive biases (i.e., with no assumptions about the problem embedded in the model) are likely to have trainability and generalization issues, especially for large problem sizes. As such, it is fundamental to develop schemes that encode as much information as available about the problem at hand. In this work we present a simple, yet powerful, framework where the underlying invariances in the data are used to build QML models that, by construction, respect those symmetries. These so-called group-invariant models produce outputs that remain invariant under the action of any element of the symmetry group (sic) associated with the dataset. We present theoretical results under-pinning the design of (sic)-invariant models, and exemplify their application through several paradigmatic QML classification tasks, including cases when (sic) is a continuous Lie group and also when it is a discrete symmetry group. Notably, our framework allows us to recover, in an elegant way, several well-known algorithms for the literature, as well as to discover new ones. Taken together, we expect that our results will help pave the way towards a more geometric and group-theoretic approach to QML model design.

TI Capacity and Quantum Geometry of Parametrized Quantum Circuits
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB To harness the potential of noisy intermediate-scale quantum devices, it is paramount to find the best type of circuits to run hybrid quantum-classical algorithms. Key candidates are parametrized quantum circuits that can be effectively implemented on current devices. Here, we evaluate the capacity and trainability of these circuits using the geometric structure of the parameter space via the effective quantum dimension, which reveals the expressive power of circuits in general as well as of particular initialization strategies. We assess the expressive power of various popular circuit types and find striking differences depending on the type of entangling gates used. Particular circuits are characterized by scaling laws in their expressiveness. We identify a transition in the quantum geometry of the parameter space, which leads to a decay of the quantum natural gradient for deep circuits. For shallow circuits, the quantum natural gradient can be orders of magnitude larger in value compared to the regular gradient; however, both of them can suffer from vanishing gradients. By tuning a fixed set of circuit parameters to randomized ones, we find a region where the circuit is expressive but does not suffer from barren plateaus, hinting at a good way to initialize circuits. We show an algorithm that prunes redundant parameters of a circuit without affecting its effective dimension. Our results enhance the understanding of parametrized quantum circuits and can be immediately applied to improve variational quantum algorithms.

TI Cloud-assisted quantum primitive protocols and applications
SO PHYSICA SCRIPTA
AB Security and privacy have always been key concerns for individuals in various cloud-assisted services. In order to enhance security, we focus on quantum cryptography in novel cloud-based applications. First, we present two quantum primitive protocols to compute XOR of two private bits and AND of two private bits with the assistance of a quantum cloud, respectively. Then, we generalize two-party protocols to the corresponding multi-party cases. These quantum primitive protocols can ensure information-theoretical security and provide long-term security, which are guaranteed by the principles of quantum mechanics. Furthermore, we present a grouping strategy to improve the communication efficiency of multiparty quantum protocols. In addition, we investigate privacy-preserving applications of these quantum primitive protocols in cloud-based environments, e.g., cloud-based Anonymous Voting and Multiparty Private Set Intersection. Finally, simulated experiments show our proposed quantum protocols are correct and feasible with the present quantum technology.

TI Investigating and controlling the quantum resources of bipartite-qubit
   detectors of scalar fields in the process of spacetime expansion
SO EUROPEAN PHYSICAL JOURNAL C
AB Quantum resources construct new avenues to explore the cosmos. Considering bipartite-qubit detectors subjected to scalar fields in an expanding spacetime, quantum resources (including quantum coherence, quantum discord, Bell-nonlocality, and nonlocal advantage of quantum coherence) of the system are characterized. The influences of various cosmic parameters on these quantum resources are investigated. Besides, we use the filtering operation to propose a strategy that can be used to control these quantum resources. The results reveal that quantum coherence and quantum discord can not disappear at different expansion rapidity, expansion volumes, and particle masses of scalar field. Conversely, one can not capture Bell-nonlocality and nonlocal advantage of quantum coherence at higher expansion rapidity, larger expansion volume, and smaller particle mass. The dissipation of quantum resources can be resisted via the filtering operation. One can use the filtering operation to remarkably strengthen these quantum resources of the system.

TI Cosmic muon flux attenuation methods for superconducting qubit
   experiments
SO NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB We propose and demonstrate two practical mitigation methods to attenuate the cosmic muon flux, compatible with experiments involving superconducting qubits: shallow underground sites and device orientation. Using a specifically-built cosmic muon detector, we identify underground sites, widely present in urban environments, where significant attenuation of cosmic muon flux, up to a factor 35 for 100 m depths, can be attained. Furthermore, we employ two germanium wafers in an above-ground laboratory, each equipped with a particle sensor, to show how the orientation of a chip with respect to the sky affects the amount and type of energy deposited on the substrate by ionizing radiation. We observe that the horizontal detector sees more counts at lower energy, while the vertical one is impacted by more particles at higher energy. The methods here described proposed ways to directly understand and reduce the effects of cosmic rays on qubits by attenuating the source of this type of decoherence, complementing existing on-chip mitigation strategies. We expect that both on-chip and off-chip methods combined will become ubiquitous in quantum technologies based on superconducting qubit circuits.

TI One-shot coherence distillation in superconducting circuit systems
SO RESULTS IN PHYSICS
AB Distilling quantum coherence is important for optimizing the performance of quantum technologies, however, it cannot always be accomplished with certainty. Then, the probabilistic distillation of quantum coherence has been developed and successfully implemented in experiments. We introduce a proposal to realize the one-shot coherence distillation in the superconducting circuit system. The target maximally coherent state can be extracted from a single copy of the prepared state by using appropriate incoherent operations and a finite error tolerance is allowed. It is easy to implement our scheme in the experiment that only a superconducting qubit is required to be the auxiliary system. To demonstrate the feasibility of our scheme, we numerically simulate the distillation process under the influence of dephasing (according to the typical experimental parameters). We find that the distillation rate of the coherence resource can be well achieved with the current experimental technique.

TI Exploring the optimality of approximate state preparation quantum
   circuits with a genetic algorithm
SO PHYSICS LETTERS A
AB We study the approximate state preparation problem on noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) computers by applying a genetic algorithm to generate quantum circuits for state preparation. The algorithm can account for the specific characteristics of the physical machine in the evaluation of circuits, such as the native gate set and qubit connectivity. We use our genetic algorithm to optimize the circuits provided by the low-rank state preparation algorithm introduced by Araujo et al., and find substantial improvements to the fidelity in preparing Haar random states with a limited number of CNOT gates. Moreover, we observe that already for a 5-qubit quantum processor with limited qubit connectivity and significant noise levels (IBM Falcon 5T), the maximal fidelity for Haar random states is achieved by a short approximate state preparation circuit instead of the exact preparation circuit. We also present a theoretical analysis of approximate state preparation circuit complexity to motivate our findings.

TI Integrating Post-Quantum Cryptography and Blockchain to Secure Low-Cost
   IoT Devices
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INDUSTRIAL INFORMATICS
AB In the contemporary era, the global proliferation of Internet of Things (IoT) devices exceeds 15 billion, serving functions from wearables to smart grid monitoring. These devices frequently manage sensitive data, underscoring the need for secure and reliable IoT networks leveraging blockchain technology. A key innovation of this study is an approach to mitigate vulnerabilities that quantum computing poses to blockchain-based IoT systems, which existing cryptographic methods cannot effectively address. Quantum computers could exploit these weaknesses to compromise key-pair generation and extract private keys from transaction signatures. To overcome this, the research introduces an optimized implementation of the post-quantum digital signature algorithm Dilithium-5, ensuring blockchain security and quantum readiness. These transaction signatures are designed for low-power, cost-effective microcontrollers, such as the ESP32, making the solution accessible for a wide range of IoT devices. In addition, the study includes a case study involving a post-quantum safe portable device for measuring blood oxygen levels and heart rate, illustrating the practical benefits and effectiveness of the proposed solution in enhancing IoT security against quantum threats. The results demonstrate that the proposed approach ensures quantum-resistant security while maintaining performance efficiency, making it suitable for real-world IoT applications.

AB We construct a classical oracle relative to which P = NP yet single-copy secure pseudorandom quantum states exist. In the language of Impagliazzo's five worlds, this is a construction of pseudorandom states in "Algorithmica," and hence shows that in a black-box setting, quantum cryptography based on pseudorandom states is possible even if one-way functions do not exist. As a consequence, we demonstrate that there exists a property of a cryptographic hash function that simultaneously (1) suffices to construct pseudorandom states, (2) holds for a random oracle, and (3) is independent of P vs. NP in the black-box setting. We also introduce a conjecture that would generalize our results to multi-copy secure pseudorandom states.
   We build on the recent construction by Aaronson, Ingram, and Kretschmer (CCC 2022) of an oracle relative to which P = NP but BQP. QCMA, based on hardness of the OR. Forrelation problem. Our proof also introduces a new discretely-defined variant of the Forrelation distribution, for which we prove pseudorandomness against AC(0) circuits. This variant may be of independent interest.

TI Transmon platform for quantum computing challenged by chaotic
   fluctuations
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB From the perspective of many-body physics, the transmon qubit architectures currently developed for quantum computing are systems of coupled nonlinear quantum resonators. A certain amount of intentional frequency detuning ('disorder') is crucially required to protect individual qubit states against the destabilizing effects of nonlinear resonator coupling. Here we investigate the stability of this variant of a many-body localized phase for system parameters relevant to current quantum processors developed by the IBM, Delft, and Google consortia, considering the cases of natural or engineered disorder. Applying three independent diagnostics of localization theory - a Kullback-Leibler analysis of spectral statistics, statistics of many-body wave functions (inverse participation ratios), and a Walsh transform of the many-body spectrum - we find that some of these computing platforms are dangerously close to a phase of uncontrollable chaotic fluctuations.
   Superconducting quantum processors need to balance intentional disorder (to protect qubits) and nonlinear resonator coupling (to manipulate qubits), while avoiding chaotic instabilities. Berke et al. use the techniques of many-body localization theory to study the stability of current platforms against quantum chaos.

TI Doubly Geometric Quantum Control
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB In holonomic quantum computation, quantum gates are performed using driving protocols that trace out closed loops on the Bloch sphere, making them robust to certain pulse errors. However, dephasing noise that is transverse to the drive, which is significant in many qubit platforms, lies outside the family of correctable errors. Here, we present a general procedure that combines two types of geometry-holonomy loops on the Bloch sphere and geometric space curves in three dimensions-to design gates that simultaneously suppress pulse errors and transverse noise errors. We demonstrate this doubly geometric control technique by designing explicit examples of single-qubit and two-qubit dynamically corrected holonomic gates.

TI Robust two-qubit gates using pulsed dynamical decoupling
SO NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB We present the experimental implementation of a two-qubit phase gate, using a radio frequency (RF) controlled trapped-ion quantum processor. The RF-driven gate is generated by a pulsed dynamical decoupling sequence applied to the ions' carrier transitions only. It allows for a tunable phase shift with high-fidelity results. The conditional phase shift is measured using a Ramsey-type measurement with an inferred fringe contrast of up to 99(-2)(+1)%. We also prepare a Bell state using this laser-free gate. The phase gate is robust against common sources of error. We investigate the effect of the excitation of the center-of-mass (COM) mode, errors in the axial trap frequency, pulse area errors and errors in sequence timing. The contrast of the phase gate is not significantly reduced up to a COM mode excitation <20 phonons, trap frequency errors of +10%, and pulse area errors of -8%. The phase shift is not significantly affected up to <10 phonons and pulse area errors of -2%. Both, contrast and phase shift are robust to timing errors up to -30% and +15%. The gate implementation is resource efficient, since only a single driving field is required per ion. Furthermore, it holds the potential for fast gate speeds (gate times on the order of 100 mu s) by using two axial motional modes of a two-ion crystal through improved setups.

TI A new heuristic approach for contextuality degree estimates and its
   four- to six-qubit portrayals
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICS A-MATHEMATICAL AND THEORETICAL
AB We introduce and describe a new heuristic method for finding an upper bound on the degree of contextuality and the corresponding unsatisfied (i.e. non-reproducible by any NCHV model) part of a quantum contextual configuration with three-element contexts (i.e. lines) located in a multi-qubit symplectic polar space of order two. While the previously used method based on a SAT solver was limited to three qubits, this new method is much faster and more versatile, enabling us to also handle four- to six-qubit cases. The method is illustrated by the structure of unsatisfied parts of the associated contextual configurations represented by quadrics and full spaces; these entail well-known finite geometries like the split Cayley hexagon of order two, the dual polar space of rank three and order two as well as certain incidence graphs of binary projective spaces of small dimensions.

TI Adaptive Continuous-Variable Quantum Key Distribution with Discrete
   Modulation Regulative in Free Space
SO MATHEMATICS
AB The finite sampling bandwidth of an analog-to-digital converter has a negative effect on the continuous-variable quantum key distribution (CVQKD), which leaves a potential loophole for an eavesdropper and weakens the practical security of the system. To compensate for the loss in free space, we deploy an adaptive optics (AO) unit in the detector of the CVQKD system with discrete modulations. Since the closed-loop control bandwidth of the embedded AO unit can be optimized with the sampling frequency, the practical security of the system can be enhanced in terms of the secret key rate. The security analysis is demonstrated on the basis of the derived secret key rate with numerical simulations, providing a feasible implementation of CVQKD in realistic free-space environments.

TI Randomness for quantum channels: Genericity of catalysis and quantum
   advantage of uniformness
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Randomness can help one to implement quantum maps that cannot be realized in a deterministic fashion. Recently, it was discovered that explicitly treating a randomness source as a quantum system could double the efficiency as a catalyst for some tasks. In this work, we first show that every quantum channel that can be implemented with a randomness source without leaking information to it must be a catalysis. For that purpose, we prove a new no-go theorem that generalizes the no-hiding theorem, the no-secret theorem that states no quantum information can be shared with other systems as a secret without leaking some information. Second, we show that nondegenerate catalysts should be used classically when no extra dimension is allowed, which leads to the fact that the quantum advantage of a catalytic process strictly comes from the uniformness of the randomness source. Finally, we discuss a method to circumvent the previous result that achieves quantum advantage with nondegenerate catalyst uniformized by employing extra work space.

TI Arithmetic Loophole in Bell's Theorem: Overlooked Threat to
   Entangled-State Quantum Cryptography
SO ACTA PHYSICA POLONICA A
AB Bell's theorem is supposed to exclude all local hidden-variable models of quantum correlations. However, an explicit counterexample shows that a new class of local realistic models, based on generalized arithmetic and calculus, can exactly reconstruct rotationally symmetric quantum probabilities typical of two-electron singlet states. Observable probabilities are consistent with the usual arithmetic employed by macroscopic observers but counterfactual aspects of Bell's theorem are sensitive to the choice of hidden-variable arithmetic and calculus. The model is classical in the sense of Einstein, Podolsky, Rosen and Bell: elements of reality exist and probabilities are modeled by integrals of hidden-variable probability densities. Probability densities have a Clauser-Horne product form typical of local realistic theories. However, neither the product nor the integral nor the representation of rotations are the usual ones. The integral has all the standard properties but only with respect to the arithmetic that defines the product. Certain formal transformations of integral expressions found in the usual proofs a la Bell do not work, so standard Bell-type inequalities cannot be proved. The system we deal with is deterministic, local-realistic, rotationally invariant, observers have free will, detectors are perfect, hence the system is free of all the canonical loopholes discussed in the literature.

TI Analysis of arbitrary superconducting quantum circuits accompanied by a
   Python package: SQcircuit
SO QUANTUM
AB Superconducting quantum circuits are a promising hardware platform for realizing a fault-tolerant quantum computer. Accelerating progress in this field of research demands general approaches and computational tools to analyze and design more complex superconducting circuits. We develop a framework to systematically construct a superconducting quantum circuit's quantized Hamiltonian from its physical description. As is often the case with quantum descriptions of multicoordinate systems, the complexity rises rapidly with the number of variables. Therefore, we introduce a set of coordinate transformations with which we can find bases to diagonalize the Hamiltonian efficiently. Furthermore, we broaden our framework's scope to calculate the circuit's key properties required for optimizing and discovering novel qubits. We implement the methods described in this work in an open-source Python package SQcircuit. In this manuscript, we introduce the reader to the SQcircuit environment and functionality. We show through a series of examples how to analyze a number of interesting quantum circuits and obtain features such as the spectrum, coherence times, transition matrix elements, coupling operators, and the phase coordinate representation of eigenfunctions.

TI Simulations of superconducting quantum gates by digital flux tuner for
   qubits
SO CHINESE PHYSICS B
AB The interconnection bottleneck caused by limitations of cable number, inner space and cooling power of dilution refrigerators has been an outstanding challenge for building scalable superconducting quantum computers with the increasing number of qubits in quantum processors. To surmount such an obstacle, it is desirable to integrate qubits with quantum-classical interface (QCI) circuits based on rapid single flux quantum (RSFQ) circuits. In this work, a digital flux tuner for qubits (DFTQ) is proposed for manipulating flux of qubits as a crucial part of the interface circuit. A schematic diagram of the DFTQ is presented, consisting of a coarse tuning unit and a fine-tuning unit for providing magnetic flux with different precision to qubits. The method of using DFTQ to provide flux for gate operations is discussed from the optimization of circuit design and input signal. To verify the effectiveness of the method, simulations of a single DFTQ and quantum gates including a Z gate and an iSWAP gate with DFTQs are performed for flux-tunable transmons. The quantum process tomography corresponding to the two gates is also carried out to analyze the sources of gate error. The results of tomography show that the gate fidelities independent of the initial states of the Z gate and the iSWAP gate are 99.935% and 99.676%, respectively. With DFTQs inside, the QCI would be a powerful tool for building large-scale quantum computers.

TI Spin qubit based on the nitrogen-vacancy center analog in a diamond-like
   compound C3BN
SO JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYSICS
AB The nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center in diamond plays important roles in emerging quantum technologies. Currently available methods to fabricate the NV center often involve complex processes such as N implantation. By contrast, in a diamond-like compound C3BN, creating a boron (B) vacancy immediately leads to an NV-center analog. We use the strongly constrained and appropriately normed semilocal density functional-this functional leads to nearly the same zero-phonon line (ZPL) energy as the experiment and as obtained from the more time-consuming hybrid density functional calculations-to explore the potential of this NV-center analog as a novel spin qubit for applications in quantum information processing. We show that the NV-center analog in C3BN possesses many similar properties to the NV center in diamond including a wide bandgap, weak spin-orbit coupling, an energetically stable negatively charged state, a highly localized spin density, a paramagnetic triplet ground state, and strong hyperfine interactions, which are the properties that make the NV center in diamond stand out as a suitable quantum bit (qubit). We also predict that the NV-center analog in C3BN exhibits two ZPL energies that correspond to longer wavelengths close to the ideal telecommunication band for quantum communications. C3BN studied here represents only one example of A(3)XY (A: group IV element; X/Y: group III/V elements) compounds. We expect many other compounds of this family to have similar NV-center analogs with a wide range of ZPL energies and functional properties, promising to be the new hosts of qubits for quantum technology applications. Furthermore, A(3)XY compounds often contain group IV elements such as silicon and germanium, so they are compatible with sophisticated semiconductor processing techniques. Our work opens up ample opportunities toward scalable qubit host materials and novel quantum devices.

AB Introduced in 1996, NTRUEncrypt is not only one of the earliest but also one of the most scrutinized lattice-based cryptosystems and expected to remain secure in the upcoming era of quantum computing. Furthermore, NTRUEncrypt offers some efficiency benefits over "pre-quantum" cryptosystems like RSA or ECC since the low-level arithmetic operations are less computation-intensive and, thus, more suitable for constrained devices. In this paper we present AVRNTRU, a highly-optimized implementation of NTRUEncrypt for 8-bit AVR microcontrollers that we developed from scratch to reach high performance and resistance to timing attacks. AVRNTRU complies with the EESS #1 v3.1 specification and supports product-form parameter sets such as ees443ep1, ees587ep1, and ees743ep1. An entire encryption (including mask generation and blinding-polynomial generation) using the ees443ep1 parameters requires 847973 clock cycles on an ATmega1281 microcontroller; the decryption is more costly and has an execution time of 1051871 cycles. We achieved these results with the help of a novel hybrid technique for multiplication in a truncated polynomial ring, whereby one of the operands is a sparse ternary polynomial in product form and the other an arbitrary element of the ring. A constant-time multiplication in the ring given by the ees443ep1 parameters takes only 192577 cycles, which sets a new speed record for the arithmetic part of a lattice-based cryptosystem on AVR.

TI A Lie algebraic theory of barren plateaus for deep parameterized quantum
   circuits
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Variational quantum computing schemes train a loss function by sending an initial state through a parametrized quantum circuit, and measuring the expectation value of some operator. Despite their promise, the trainability of these algorithms is hindered by barren plateaus (BPs) induced by the expressiveness of the circuit, the entanglement of the input data, the locality of the observable, or the presence of noise. Up to this point, these sources of BPs have been regarded as independent. In this work, we present a general Lie algebraic theory that provides an exact expression for the variance of the loss function of sufficiently deep parametrized quantum circuits, even in the presence of certain noise models. Our results allow us to understand under one framework all aforementioned sources of BPs. This theoretical leap resolves a standing conjecture about a connection between loss concentration and the dimension of the Lie algebra of the circuit's generators.

We explore the bipartite entropic uncertainty relation and dense coding for two qubits coupled via dipole-dipole interaction and subject to a bosonic reservoir. It is shown that there exists a trade-off between the uncertainty bound and the dense coding capacity which results in their opposite dynamical behaviors. Moreover, the behaviors of the measurement uncertainty and the dense coding capacity rely crucially on the initial system-reservoir correlation, the strength of the dipole-dipole interaction, and the degree of non-Markovianity, and one can reduce the measurement uncertainty and enhance the dense coding capacity by tuning these parameters to appropriate values.

TI A Hybrid Quantum-Classical Approach for Multi-Class Skin Disease
   Classification Using a 4-Qubit Model
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB Quantum machine learning (QML) presents a promising avenue for addressing complex classification challenges, yet its application in medical imaging remains largely unexplored. This work introduces a hybrid quantum-classical framework designed to classify skin diseases, Chickenpox, Measles, Monkeypox, and Normal, using a 4 qubit quantum system. The framework integrates a Quantum Convolutional Neural Network (QCNN) for feature extraction and a Variational Quantum Classifier (VQC) for classification, processing a dataset of 770 images with significant class imbalance. We employ a class-weighted loss function with weights $w_{y_{i}} = [{3.0, 3.5, 0.6, 0.4}]$ to address this imbalance, ensuring balanced representation across all classes. The model is optimized using Simultaneous Perturbation Stochastic Approximation (SPSA) over 150 iterations, achieving a test accuracy 70.13% on a subset of 154 images, representing 20% of the dataset. This marks a substantial improvement over both a random baseline of 25% and a prior run that achieved 37.66% accuracy, which was skewed toward the majority class. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) reduces image features to a 4-dimensional representation, enabling compatibility with the quantum system. The QCNN extracts these features, while the VQC performs classification based on measurements from 1024 shots on the QASM simulator. To ensure practical reusability, the trained model, including quantum circuits, optimized parameters, and PCA transformations, is saved for future deployment. Validation on a separate set of 24 samples (6 per class) yields 70.83% accuracy (17 out of 24 correct predictions), demonstrating the model's generalization capabilities. While the performance falls short of classical benchmarks, this study establishes the feasibility of QML with minimal qubits, paving the way for quantum driven diagnostics in resource constrained environments.

TI Strain Quantum Sensing with Spin Defects in Hexagonal Boron Nitride
SO NANO LETTERS
AB Hexagonal boron nitride is not only a promising functional material for the development of two-dimensional optoelectronic devices but also a good candidate for quantum sensing thanks to the presence of quantum emitters in the form of atom-like defects. Their exploitation in quantum technologies necessitates understanding their coherence properties as well as their sensitivity to external stimuli. In this work, we probe the strain configuration of boron vacancy centers (VB-) created by ion implantation in h-BN flakes thanks to wide-field spatially resolved optically detected magnetic resonance and submicro Raman spectroscopy. Our experiments demonstrate the ability of VB- for quantum sensing of strain and, given the omnipresence of h-BN in 2D-based devices, open the door for in situ imaging of strain under working conditions.

TI THREE PRINCIPLES OF QUANTUM COMPUTING
SO QUANTUM INFORMATION & COMPUTATION
AB The point of building a quantum computer is that it allows to model living things with predictive power and gives the opportunity to control life. Its scaling means not just the improvement of the instrument part, but also, mainly, mathematical and software tools, and our understanding of the QC problem. The first principle of quantum modeling is the reduction of reality to finite-dimensional models similar to QED in optical cavities. The second principle is a strict limitation of the so-called Feynman principle, the number of qubits in the standard formulation of the QC. This means treating decoherence exclusively as a limitation of the memory of a classical modeling computer, and introducing corresponding progressive restrictions on the working area of the Hilbert space of quantum states as the model expands. The third principle is similarity in processes of different nature. The quantum nature of reality is manifested in this principle; its nature is quantum nonlocality, which is the main property that ensures the prospects of quantum physical devices and their radical advantage over classical ones.

TI Parallel remote state preparation for fully device-independent
   verifiable blind quantum computation
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB We introduce a device-independent two-prover scheme in which a classical verifier can use a simple untrusted quantum measurement device (the client device) to securely delegate a quantum computation to an untrusted quantum server. To do this, we construct a parallel self-testing protocol to perform device-independent remote state preparation of n qubits and compose this with the unconditionally secure universal verifiable blind quantum computation (VBQC) scheme of Fitzsimons and Kashefi [Phys. Rev. A 96, 012303 (2017)]. Our self-test achieves a multitude of desirable properties for the application we consider, giving rise to practical and fully deviceindependent VBQC. It certifies parallel measurements of all cardinal and intercardinal directions in the XY plane as well as the computational basis, uses few input questions (of size logarithmic in n for the client and a constant number communicated to the server) and requires only single-qubit measurements to be performed by the client device.

TI Optical Fibers With Memory Effects and Their Quantum Communication
   Capacities
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INFORMATION THEORY
AB If the transmissivity of an optical fibre falls below a critical value, its use as a reliable quantum channel is known to be drastically compromised. However, if the memoryless assumption does not hold - e.g. when input signals are separated by a sufficiently short time interval - the validity of this limitation is put into question. In this work we introduce a model of optical fibre that can describe memory effects for long transmission lines. We then solve its quantum capacity, two-way quantum capacity, and secret-key capacity exactly. By doing so, we show that - due to the memory cross-talk between the transmitted signals - reliable quantum communication is attainable even for highly noisy regimes where it was previously considered impossible.

TI Automated Quantum Hardware Selection for Quantum Workflows
SO ELECTRONICS
AB The execution of a quantum algorithm typically requires various classical pre- and post-processing tasks. Hence, workflows are a promising means to orchestrate these tasks, benefiting from their reliability, robustness, and features, such as transactional processing. However, the implementations of the tasks may be very heterogeneous and they depend on the quantum hardware used to execute the quantum circuits of the algorithm. Additionally, today's quantum computers are still restricted, which limits the size of the quantum circuits that can be executed. As the circuit size often depends on the input data of the algorithm, the selection of quantum hardware to execute a quantum circuit must be done at workflow runtime. However, modeling all possible alternative tasks would clutter the workflow model and require its adaptation whenever a new quantum computer or software tool is released. To overcome this problem, we introduce an approach to automatically select suitable quantum hardware for the execution of quantum circuits in workflows. Furthermore, it enables the dynamic adaptation of the workflows, depending on the selection at runtime based on reusable workflow fragments. We validate our approach with a prototypical implementation and a case study demonstrating the hardware selection for Simon's algorithm.

TI LIMDD: A Decision Diagram for Simulation of Quantum Computing Including
   Stabilizer States
SO QUANTUM
AB Efficient methods for the representation and simulation of quantum states and quantum operations are crucial for the optimization of quantum circuits. Decision diagrams (DDs), a well-studied data structure originally used to represent Boolean functions, have proven capable of capturing relevant aspects of quantum systems, but their limits are not well understood. In this work, we investigate and bridge the gap between existing DD-based structures and the stabilizer formalism, an important tool for simulating quantum circuits in the tractable regime. We first show that although DDs were suggested to succinctly represent important quantum states, they actually require exponential space for certain stabilizer states. To remedy this, we introduce a more powerful decision diagram variant, called Local Invertible Map-DD (LIMDD). We prove that the set of quantum states represented by poly-sized LIMDDs strictly contains the union of stabilizer states and other decision diagram variants. Finally, there exist circuits which LIMDDs can efficiently simulate, while their output states cannot be succinctly represented by two state-of-the-art simulation paradigms: the stabilizer decomposition techniques for Clifford + T circuits and Matrix-Product States. By uniting two successful approaches, LIMDDs thus pave the way for fundamentally more powerful solutions for simulation and analysis of quantum computing.

TI Dynamically generated decoherence-free subspaces and subsystems on
   superconducting qubits
SO REPORTS ON PROGRESS IN PHYSICS
AB Decoherence-free subspaces and subsystems (DFS) preserve quantum information by encoding it into symmetry-protected states unaffected by decoherence. An inherent DFS of a given experimental system may not exist; however, through the use of dynamical decoupling (DD), one can induce symmetries that support DFSs. Here, we provide the first experimental demonstration of DD-generated decoherence-free subsystem logical qubits. Utilizing IBM Quantum superconducting processors, we investigate two and three-qubit DFS codes comprising up to six and seven noninteracting logical qubits, respectively. Through a combination of DD and error detection, we show that DFS logical qubits can achieve up to a 23% improvement in state preservation fidelity over physical qubits subject to DD alone. This constitutes a beyond-breakeven fidelity improvement for DFS-encoded qubits. Our results showcase the potential utility of DFS codes as a pathway toward enhanced computational accuracy via logical encoding on quantum processors.

AB Among the emerging technologies with prophesied quantum advantage, quantum communications has already led to fascinating demonstrations-including quantum teleportation to and from satellites. However, all optical communication necessitates the use of optical devices, the comprehensive quantum thermodynamic description of which is still severely lacking. In the present analysis, we prove several versions of Landauer's principle for noisy polarizers, namely, absorbing linear polarizers and polarizing beam splitters. As main results, we obtain statements of the second law quantifying the minimal amount of heat that is dissipated in the creation of linearly polarized light. Our findings are illustrated with an experimentally tractable example, namely, the temperature dependence of a quantum eraser.

TI Dynamical topological phase realized in a trapped-ion quantum simulator
SO NATURE
AB Nascent platforms for programmable quantum simulation offer unprecedented access to new regimes of far-from-equilibrium quantum many-body dynamics in almost isolated systems. Here achieving precise control over quantum many-body entanglement is an essential task for quantum sensing and computation. Extensive theoretical work indicates that these capabilities can enable dynamical phases and critical phenomena that show topologically robust methods to create, protect and manipulate quantum entanglement that self-correct against large classes of errors. However, so far, experimental realizations have been confined to classical (non-entangled) symmetry-breaking orders(1-5). In this work, we demonstrate an emergent dynamical symmetry-protected topological phase(6), in a quasiperiodically driven array of ten Yb-171(+) hyperfine qubits in Quantinuum's System Model H1 trapped-ion quantum processor(7). This phase shows edge qubits that are dynamically protected from control errors, cross-talk and stray fields. Crucially, this edge protection relies purely on emergent dynamical symmetries that are absolutely stable to generic coherent perturbations. This property is special to quasiperiodically driven systems: as we demonstrate, the analogous edge states of a periodically driven qubit array are vulnerable to symmetry-breaking errors and quickly decohere. Our work paves the way for implementation of more complex dynamical topological orders(8,9) that would enable error-resilient manipulation of quantum information.

We give lower bounds on loop weights that guarantee strong transfer fidelity that works for any graph where this protocol is feasible. By considering local spectral symmetry, we show that the required weight size depends only on the maximum degree of the graph and, in some less favorable cases, the distance between vertices. Additionally, we explore the duration for which transfer strength remains above a specified threshold. (c) 2024 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB Multiphoton correlations in linear photonic quantum networks are governed by matrix permanents. Yet, surprisingly few systematic properties of these crucial algebraic objects are known. As such, predicting the overall multiphoton behavior of a network from its individual building blocks typically defies intuition. In this work, we identify sequences of concatenated two-mode linear optical transformations whose two-photon behavior is invariant under reversal of the order. We experimentally verify this systematic behavior in parity-time-symmetric complex interferometer arrangements of varying compositions. Our results underline new ways in which quantum correlations may be preserved in counterintuitive ways, even in small-scale non-Hermitian networks.

AB We address the issue of the discrimination between two-qubit amplitude damping channels by exploring several strategies. For the single-shot, we show that the excited state does not always give the optimal input, and that side entanglement assistance has limited benefit. On the contrary, feedback assistance from the environment is more beneficial. For the two-shot, we prove the in-utility of entangled inputs. Then focusing on individual (local) measurements, we find the optimal adaptive strategy.

TI Adaptive basis sets for practical quantum computing
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF QUANTUM CHEMISTRY
AB Electronic structure calculations on small systems such as H-2, H2O, LiH, and BeH2 with chemical accuracy are still a challenge for the current generation of noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices. One of the reasons is that due to the device limitations, only minimal basis sets are commonly applied in quantum chemical calculations, which allows one to keep the number of qubits employed in the calculations at a minimum. However, the use of minimal basis sets leads to very large errors in the computed molecular energies as well as potential energy surface shapes. One way to increase the accuracy of electronic structure calculations is through the development of small basis sets better suited for quantum computing. In this work, we show that the use of adaptive basis sets, in which exponents and contraction coefficients depend on molecular structure, provides an easy way to dramatically improve the accuracy of quantum chemical calculations without the need to increase the basis set size and thus the number of qubits utilized in quantum circuits. As a proof of principle, we optimize an adaptive minimal basis set for quantum computing calculations on an H-2 molecule, in which exponents and contraction coefficients depend on the H-H distance, and apply it to the generation of H-2 potential energy surface on IBM-Q quantum devices. The adaptive minimal basis set reaches the accuracy of the double-zeta basis sets, thus allowing one to perform double-zeta quality calculations on quantum devices without the need to utilize twice as many qubits in simulations. This approach can be extended to other molecular systems and larger basis sets in a straightforward manner.

TI Remote entanglement distribution in a quantum network via multinode
   indistinguishability of photons
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Quantum networking relies on entanglement distribution between distant nodes, typically realized by swapping procedures. However, entanglement swapping is a demanding task in practice, mainly because of limited effectiveness of entangled photon sources and Bell-state measurements necessary to realize the process. Here we experimentally activate a remote distribution of two-photon polarization entanglement superseding the need for initial entangled pairs and traditional Bell-state measurements. This alternative procedure is accomplished thanks to the controlled spatial indistinguishability of four independent photons in three separated nodes of the network, which enables us to perform localized product-state measurements in the central node acting as a trigger. This experiment proves that the inherent indistinguishability of identical particles supply promising standards for feasible quantum communication in multinode photonic quantum networks.

TI Pure State Tomography with Fourier Transformation
SO ADVANCED QUANTUM TECHNOLOGIES
AB Extracting information from quantum devices has long been a crucial problem in the field of quantum mechanics. By performing elaborate measurements, quantum state tomography, an important and fundamental tool in quantum science and technology, can be used to determine unknown quantum states completely. In this study, methods to determine multi-qubit pure quantum states uniquely and directly are explored. Two adaptive protocols are proposed, with their respective quantum circuits. Herein, two or three observables are sufficient, while the number of measurement outcomes are either the same as or fewer than those in existing methods. Additionally, experiments on the IBM 5-qubit quantum computer, as well as numerical investigations, demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed protocols.

SO QUANTUM SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB We provide a noisy intermediate-scale quantum framework for simulating the dynamics of open quantum systems, generalized time evolution, non-linear differential equations and Gibbs state preparation. Our algorithm does not require any classical-quantum feedback loop, bypass the barren plateau problem and does not necessitate any complicated measurements such as the Hadamard test. We introduce the notion of the hybrid density matrix, which allows us to disentangle the different steps of our algorithm and delegate classically demanding tasks to the quantum computer. Our algorithm proceeds in three disjoint steps. First, we select the ansatz, followed by measuring overlap matrices on a quantum computer. The final step involves classical post-processing data from the second step. Our algorithm has potential applications in solving the Navier-Stokes equation, plasma hydrodynamics, quantum Boltzmann training, quantum signal processing and linear systems. Our entire framework is compatible with current experiments and can be implemented immediately.

TI Quantum Entanglement between Optical and Microwave Photonic Qubits
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW X
AB Entanglement is an extraordinary feature of quantum mechanics. Sources of entangled optical photons were essential to test the foundations of quantum physics through violations of Bell's inequalities. More recently, entangled many-body states have been realized via strong nonlinear interactions in microwave circuits with superconducting qubits. Here, we demonstrate a chip-scale source of entangled optical and microwave photonic qubits. Our device platform integrates a piezo-optomechanical transducer with a superconducting resonator which is robust under optical illumination. We drive a photon-pair generation process and employ a dual-rail encoding intrinsic to our system to prepare entangled states of microwave and optical photons. We place a lower bound on the fidelity of the entangled state by measuring microwave and optical photons in two orthogonal bases. This entanglement source can directly interface telecom wavelength time-bin qubits and gigahertz frequency superconducting qubits, two well-established platforms for quantum communication and computation, respectively.

TI The role of higher-order terms in trapped-ion quantum computing with
   magnetic gradient induced coupling
SO QUANTUM SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB Trapped-ion hardware based on the magnetic gradient induced coupling (MAGIC) scheme is emerging as a promising platform for quantum computing. Nevertheless, in this-as in any other-quantum-computing platform, many technical questions still have to be resolved before large-scale and error-tolerant applications are possible. In this work, we present a thorough discussion of the structure and effects of higher-order terms in the MAGIC setup, which can occur due to anharmonicities in the external potential of the ion crystal (e.g. through Coulomb repulsion) or through curvature of the applied magnetic field. These terms generate systematic shifts in the leading-order interactions and take the form of three-spin couplings, two-spin couplings, local fields, as well as diverse phonon-phonon conversion mechanisms. We find that most of these are negligible in realistic situations, with only two contributions that need careful attention. First, there are undesired longitudinal fields contributing shifts to the resonance frequency, whose strength increases with chain length and phonon occupation numbers; while their mean effect can easily be compensated by additional Z rotations, phonon number fluctuations need to be avoided for precise gate operations. Second, anharmonicities of the Coulomb interaction can lead to well-known two-to-one conversions of phonon excitations. Both of these error terms can be mitigated by sufficiently cooling the phonons to the ground-state. Our detailed analysis constitutes an important contribution on the way of making magnetic-gradient trapped-ion quantum technology fit for large-scale applications, and it may inspire new ways to purposefully design interaction terms.

AB In 2018, Aono et al. (ASIACRYPT 2018) proposed to use quantum backtracking algorithms (Montanaro, TOC 2018; Ambainis and Kokainis, STOC 2017) to speedup lattice point enumeration. Quantum lattice sieving algorithms had already been proposed (Laarhoven et al., PQCRYPTO 2013), being shown to provide an asymptotic speedup over classical counterparts, but also to lose competitiveness at dimensions relevant to cryptography if practical considerations on quantum computer architecture were taken into account (Albrecht et al., ASIACRYPT 2020). Aono et al.'s work argued that quantum walk speedups can be applied to lattice enumeration, achieving at least a quadratic asymptotic speedup a la Grover search while not requiring exponential amounts of quantum accessible classical memory, as it is the case for sieving. In this work, we explore how to lower bound the cost of using Aono et al.'s techniques on lattice enumeration with extreme cylinder pruning, assuming a limit to the maximum depth that a quantum computation can achieve without decohering, with the objective of better understanding the practical applicability of quantum backtracking in lattice cryptanalysis.

TI A General Theory of Comparison of Quantum Channels (and Beyond)
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INFORMATION THEORY
AB We present a general theory of comparison of quantum channels, concerning with the question of simulability or approximate simulability of a given quantum channel by allowed transformations of another given channel. We introduce a modification of conditional min-entropies, with respect to the set F of allowed transformations, and show that under some conditions on F, these quantities characterize approximate simulability. If F is the set of free superchannels in a quantum resource theory of processes, the modified conditional min-entropies form a complete set of resource monotones. If the transformations in F consist of a preprocessing and a postprocessing of specified forms, approximate simulability is also characterized in terms of success probabilities in certain guessing games, where a preprocessing of a given form can be chosen and the measurements are restricted. These results are applied to several specific cases of simulability of quantum channels, including postprocessings, preprocessings and processing of bipartite channels by LOCC superchannels and by partial superchannels, as well as simulability of sets of quantum measurements. These questions are first studied in a general setting that is an extension of the framework of general probabilistic theories (GPT), suitable for dealing with channels. Here we prove a general theorem that shows that approximate simulability can be characterized by comparing outcome probabilities in certain tests. This result is inspired by the classical Le Cam randomization criterion for statistical experiments and contains its finite dimensional version as a special case.

TI Quantum integrated sensing and communication via entanglement
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW APPLIED
AB Quantum communication and quantum metrology are widely compelling applications in the field of quantum information science, and quantum remote sensing is an intersection of both. Despite their differences, there are notable commonalities between quantum communication and quantum remote sensing, as they achieve their functionalities through the transmission of quantum states. Here we propose a quantum integrated sensing and communication (QISAC) protocol, which achieves quantum sensing under the Heisenberg limit while simultaneously enabling quantum secure communication through the transmission of entanglements. We have theoretically proven its security against eavesdroppers. The security of QISAC is characterized by the secrecy capacity for the information bit as well as asymmetric Fisher information gain for sensing. Through simulations conducted under the constraints of limited entanglement resources, we illustrate that QISAC maintains high accuracy in the estimation of phase. Hence, our QISAC offers a fresh perspective for applications of future quantum networks.

TI Entanglement concentration of high-dimensional unknown partially
   entangled state
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB High-dimensional quantum systems offer a number of advantages in larger information capacity, stronger noise resiliency, higher efficiency, and accuracy over the qubit systems. In quantum communication, the maximally entangled states will inevitably become mixed states or less-entangled pure states due to the channel noise during practical transmission or storage. We propose a universal scheme to concentrate nonlocal high-dimensional generalized Bell states with unknown parameters. After the cross-Kerr nonlinearities, X-quadrature homodyne measurements, and single-partite projection measurements are performed only at Bob's site, a two-qutr it maximally entangled Bell state can be distilled, while previous entanglement concentration protocols (ECPs) mostly focused on two-level qubit systems. The concentrated partially entangled qubit states, reserved as the by-product, are the fascinating resources for some quantum information processing tasks. Moreover, single-qutrit projection measurement, the key ingredient for our ECP with unknown parameters, is completed by using linear optical elements. Additionally, linear optical high-dimensional ECP with known parameters is also designed. (c) 2025 Optica Publishing Group under the terms of the Optica Open Access Publishing Agreement

TI Quantum simulation of non-Abelian lattice gauge theories: A variational
   approach to D8 with dynamical matter
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Quantum simulation of lattice gauge theories (LGTs) provides a powerful framework for understanding nonperturbative phenomena. However, to realize the hope of answering challenging physics questions on near-term devices it is crucial to develop resource-efficient formulations, in particular for non-Abelian LGTs and beyond (1+1) dimensions. In this work, we address this issue by focusing on the difficulty of simulating fermionic degrees of freedom and on mitigating the Hilbert space redundancy, i.e., the presence of exponentially many nonphysical states that do not obey gauge invariance. First, we show a procedure that removes the matter and improves the hardware-resource efficiency. We demonstrate it for the simplest non-Abelian group addressable with this procedure, D8, in the cases of both one and two spatial dimensions. Then, with the objective of running a variational quantum simulation on real quantum hardware, we map the D8 LGT onto qudit systems with local interactions. We propose a variational scheme for the qudit system with a local Hamiltonian, which can be implemented on a universal qudit quantum device. Our results show the effectiveness of the matter-removing procedure, solving the redundancy problem, and reducing the amount of quantum resources. This approach can serve as a way of simulating LGTs in high spatial dimensions, with non-Abelian gauge groups, and including dynamical fermions.

AB The emerging integrated quantum photonics is pushing forward the establishment of quantum networks. To interconnect individual chip-based quantum sources, high-performance entanglement swapping is indispensable. Here, using low-loss silicon chips with waveguide structure and frequency-offset pumps, high-rate cross-channel entanglement swapping is demonstrated. A record-high swapping rate of 207 counts per hour is obtained, and the measured swapping visibilities between each of two pairs of channels exceed 90%. The proposed cross-channel architecture allows dynamic channel switching by adjusting pump wavelengths, enabling flexible user pairing in quantum networks. This work makes a concrete benchmark for chip-based entanglement swapping and provides a viable solution for real-world quantum communication.

TI Quantum-classical correspondence in quantum channels
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW E
AB Quantum channels describe subsystem or open-system evolution. Using the classical Koopman operator that evolves functions on phase space, four classical Koopman channels are identified as analogs of the four possible quantum channels in a bipartite setting. Thus, when the complete evolution has a quantum-classical correspondence, the correspondence at the level of the subunitary channels can be studied. The channels, both classical and quantum, can be interpreted as noisy single-particle systems. Having parallel classical and quantum operators gives us new access to study the fine details of these major limiting theories. Using a coupled kicked rotor as a generic example, we contrast and compare spectra of the quantum and classical channels. The largest nontrivial mode of the quantum channel is seen to be mostly determined by the stable parts of the classical phase space, even those that are surprisingly small relative to the scale of an effective h<overline>. In cases where the dynamics have a significant fraction of chaos, the spectrum exhibits a prominent annular density, which is approximately described by the single-ring theorem of random matrix theory. The ring shrinks in size when the classical limit is approached. However, the eigenvalues and modes that survive the classical limit appear to be scarred by unstable manifolds or, if they exist, stable periodic orbits.

SO PHYSICAL REVIEW APPLIED
AB Atmospheric free space and fiber have been widely exploited as the channels for quantum communication, and have enabled intercontinent and intercity applications. An air-sea free-space channel, being capable of linking the satellite-based quantum resource and underwater vehicle, has now become the last piece of the puzzle in building a global quantum communication network. Here, we present an experimental demonstration of air-water decoy-state quantum key distribution against high loss, meanwhile keeping a low quantum bit error rate less than 2.5% for different distances. We are able to reach a long-distance quantum key distribution in water channel that can enable real-life air-sea quantum-communication tasks. The demonstrated distance, even in coastal water of Jerlov type III, is up to 30 m, about one-order improvement over the proof-in-principle demonstrations in the previous experiments, and the channel loss is equivalent to 345-m-long clean seawater of Jerlov type I, representing a key step forward to practical air-sea secure communication.

   state
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB The ultrastrong coupling between the elementary excitations of matter and microcavity modes is studied in a fully analytical quantum-mechanical theoretical framework. The elementary excitation could be phonons, excitons, plasmons, etc. From the diagonalization of the Hamiltonian, we obtain the ground state of the polariton Hamiltonian. The ground state belongs to the Gaussian class. Using the Gaussian property, we calculate the quantum entanglement in the ground state. We use two different measures for quantum entanglement-entanglement entropy and the logarithmic negativity parameter-and obtain rather simple analytical expressions for the entanglement measures. Our findings show that the amount of quantum entanglement in the ground state is quite significant in the ultrastrong-coupling regime. It can be obtained from the measurement of the polariton frequencies.

We fully characterize the quantum Fisher information for frequency estimation, and the Helstrom bound for frequency discrimination. By going beyond the asymptotic regime, we show that the Heisenberg precision can be achieved with experimentally reachable parameters.

TI Quantum Weighted Fractional-Order Transform
SO FRACTAL AND FRACTIONAL
AB Quantum Fourier transform (QFT) transformation plays a very important role in the design of many quantum algorithms. Fractional Fourier transform (FRFT), as an extension of the Fourier transform, is particularly important due to the design of its quantum algorithm. In this paper, a new reformulation of the weighted fractional Fourier transform (WFRFT) is proposed in order to realize quantum FRFT; however, we found that this reformulation can be applied to other transformations, and therefore, this paper presents the weighted fractional Hartley transform (WFRHT). For the universality of application, we further propose a general weighted fractional-order transform (WFRT). When designing the quantum circuits, we realized the quantum WFRFT via QFT and quantum phase estimation (QPE). Moreover, after extending our design to the WFRHT, we were able to formulate the quantum WFRHT. Finally, in accordance with the research results, we designed the quantum circuit of the general WFRT, and subsequently proposed the quantum WFRT. The research in this paper has great value as a reference for the design and application of quantum algorithms.

TI Eigenmodes of Latent-Symmetric Quantum Photonic Networks
SO ACS PHOTONICS
AB We investigate the impact of latent symmetries on the dynamics of photonic systems and their eigenmodes. Residing solely within the eigenspectral domain, latent symmetries are not visible in real space yet promise intriguing new ways to engineer the functionality of photonic systems. We study the eigenmodes of a 9-site latent-symmetric photonic network and experimentally demonstrate that classical antisymmetric excitations of the latent-symmetric sites are fundamentally precluded from populating so-called singlet sites. Since arbitrary extensions of the system at these sites do not break its latent symmetry, antisymmetric excitations cannot leave the initial system, which can be leveraged, e.g., for the storage of information. We expand this approach to multiparticle excitations and theoretically investigate how two-photon quantum excitations behave in our photonic network. We find that both latent symmetry and the presence of singlet sites are preserved in this realm. Overall, latent symmetries introduce a powerful new set of tools to the design of systems with desired functionality on any nanophotonic platform, paving the way for applications in photonic information processing.

TI Entanglement across separate silicon dies in a modular superconducting
   qubit device
SO NPJ QUANTUM INFORMATION
AB Assembling future large-scale quantum computers out of smaller, specialized modules promises to simplify a number of formidable science and engineering challenges. One of the primary challenges in developing a modular architecture is in engineering high fidelity, low-latency quantum interconnects between modules. Here we demonstrate a modular solid state architecture with deterministic inter-module coupling between four physically separate, interchangeable superconducting qubit integrated circuits, achieving two-qubit gate fidelities as high as 99.1 +/- 0.5% and 98.3 +/- 0.3% for iSWAP and CZ entangling gates, respectively. The quality of the inter-module entanglement is further confirmed by a demonstration of Bell-inequality violation for disjoint pairs of entangled qubits across the four separate silicon dies. Having proven out the fundamental building blocks, this work provides the technological foundations for a modular quantum processor: technology which will accelerate near-term experimental efforts and open up new paths to the fault-tolerant era for solid state qubit architectures.

TI Quantum Neurobiology
SO QUANTUM REPORTS
AB Quantum neurobiology is concerned with potential quantum effects operating in the brain and the application of quantum information science to neuroscience problems, the latter of which is the main focus of the current paper. The human brain is fundamentally a multiscalar problem, with complex behavior spanning nine orders of magnitude-scale tiers from the atomic and cellular level to brain networks and the central nervous system. In this review, we discuss a new generation of bio-inspired quantum technologies in the emerging field of quantum neurobiology and present a novel physics-inspired theory of neural signaling (AdS/Brain (anti-de Sitter space)). Three tiers of quantum information science-directed neurobiology applications can be identified. First are those that interpret empirical data from neural imaging modalities (EEG, MRI, CT, PET scans), protein folding, and genomics with wavefunctions and quantum machine learning. Second are those that develop neural dynamics as a broad approach to quantum neurobiology, consisting of superpositioned data modeling evaluated with quantum probability, neural field theories, filamentary signaling, and quantum nanoscience. Third is neuroscience physics interpretations of foundational physics findings in the context of neurobiology. The benefit of this work is the possibility of an improved understanding of the resolution of neuropathologies such as Alzheimer's disease.

TI Light-induced electron spin qubit coherences in the purple bacteria
   reaction center protein
SO PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY CHEMICAL PHYSICS
AB Photosynthetic reaction center proteins (RCs) provide ideal model systems for studying quantum entanglement between multiple spins, a quantum mechanical phenomenon wherein the properties of the entangled particles become inherently correlated. Following light-generated sequential electron transfer, RCs generate spin-correlated radical pairs (SCRPs), also referred to as entangled spin qubit (radical) pairs (SQPs). Understanding and controlling coherence mechanisms in SCRP/SQPs is important for realizing practical uses of electron spin qubits in quantum sensing applications. The bacterial RC (bRC) provides an experimental system for exploring quantum effects in the SCRP P865+ QA-, where P865, a special pair of bacteriochlorophylls, is the primary donor, and QA is the primary quinone acceptor. In this study, we focus on understanding how local molecular environments and isotopic substitution, particularly deuteration, influence spin coherence times (TM). Using high-frequency electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy, we observed that the local environment surrounding P865 and QA plays a significant role in determining TM. Our findings show that while deuteration led to a modest increase in TM, particularly at low temperatures, but the effect was substantially smaller than predicted by classical nuclear spin diffusion alone. This result is in contrast to our previous study of the photosystem I (PSI) RC, where no increase in TM was observed upon deuteration. Theoretical modeling identified several methyl groups at key distances from the spin centers of both bRC and PSI, and methyl group tunneling at low temperatures has been previously suggested as a mechanism for enhanced spin decoherence. Additionally, our study revealed a strong dependence of spin coherence on the orientation of the external magnetic field, highlighting the influence of the protein microenvironment on spin dynamics. These results offer new insights for optimizing coherence times in quantum system design for quantum information science and sensing applications.

TI Protecting the Entanglement of X-Type Systems via Weak Measurement and
   Reversal in the Generalized Amplitude Damping Channel
SO ENTROPY
AB The study of system evolution in generalized amplitude damping is of great significance in quantum information science and quantum computing. As an important quantum noise channel, the generalized amplitude damping channel can describe the general phenomenon of the energy dissipation effect in quantum systems at finite temperature. In this paper, we study the use of weak measurement and reversal to protect the entanglement of X-type systems in generalized amplitude damping channels, and give an experimental scheme. The results show that the closer to zero the temperature environment, the better the protection effect of weak measurement and reversal, but the lower the success rate. Therefore, when choosing an experimental environment, it is important to consider not only the temperature factor but also the probability of success. Because all quantum systems work at finite temperatures, it is hoped that the study of generalized amplitude damping channels can help design more robust quantum algorithms and protocols to improve the efficiency and stability of quantum information processing.

TI Radiative processes on a quantum computer
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW C
AB Radiative processes, where a photon/neutrino is emitted as a result of a collision or decay of a particle, play a central role in atomic, nuclear, and particle physics. Their rate is determined by certain off-diagonal matrix elements between different initial and final states. We propose a method to compute them using quantum computers. It relies on a single extra qubit that, in a certain sense, represents the photon/neutrino. The generic formula relating this matrix element to the amplitude and frequency of oscillations of the extra qubit is derived for the near-resonance case. We demonstrate the feasibility of the method by using it in actual quantum computations and simulations of simple systems.

TI Beating the Thermal Limit of Qubit Initialization with a Bayesian
   Maxwell?s Demon
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW X
AB Fault-tolerant quantum computing requires initializing the quantum register in a well-defined fiducial state. In solid-state systems, this is typically achieved through thermalization to a cold reservoir, such that the initialization fidelity is fundamentally limited by temperature. Here, we present a method of preparing a fiducial quantum state with a confidence beyond the thermal limit. It is based on real-time monitoring of the qubit through a negative-result measurement-the equivalent of a "Maxwell's demon" that triggers the experiment only upon the appearance of a qubit in the lowest-energy state. We experimentally apply it to initialize an electron spin qubit in silicon, achieving a ground-state initialization fidelity of 98.9(4)%, corresponding to a 20x reduction in initialization error compared to the unmonitored system. A fidelity approaching 99.9% could be achieved with realistic improvements in the bandwidth of the amplifier chain or by slowing down the rate of electron tunneling from the reservoir. We use a nuclear spin ancilla, measured in quantum nondemolition mode, to prove the value of the electron initialization fidelity far beyond the intrinsic fidelity of the electron readout. However, the method itself does not require an ancilla for its execution, saving the need for additional resources. The quantitative analysis of the initialization fidelity reveals that a simple picture of spin-dependent electron tunneling does not correctly describe the data. Our digital Maxwell's demon can be applied to a wide range of quantum systems, with minimal demands on control and detection hardware.

TI Quantum direct portation
SO ACTA PHYSICA SINICA
AB Quantum state that carries classical information, 0 or 1, can be safely and reliably transmitted using quantum secure direct communication. How to transmit an arbitrary quantum state is a wider issue and has important applications. One way is to use quantum teleportation, namely, first distribute a large number of Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen pairs, and then perform entanglement purification to obtain a near-perfect pair, and make quantum teleportation using the pair. In this article, we propose a method that directly port the quantum state with security and reliability using quantum secure direct communication. After sufficient number of copies of the same state have been directly ported, single-particle purification is performed to obtain a near perfect single particle state. This is important because it offers a new method for sending an arbitrary single particle state securely and reliably without using quantum teleportation. It is also an important extension of quantum secure direct communication to send an arbitrary quantum state. Quantum direct portation will have great potential in quantum internet.

These states are engineered using both external quantized momenta states and energy levels of neutral atoms under off-resonant and resonant Atomic Bragg Diffraction (ABD) technique.

In order to assess the operational behavior of such states when subjected to a realistic noise environment has also been simulated, demonstrating long enough sustainability of the proposed states.

TI Estimating the impact of light pollution on quantum communication
   between QEYSSat and Canadian quantum ground station sites
SO EPJ QUANTUM TECHNOLOGY
AB Satellite to ground quantum communication typically operates at night to reduce background signals, however it remains susceptible to noise from light pollution of the night sky. In this study we compare several methodologies for determining whether a Quantum Ground Station (QGS) site is viable for exchanging quantum signals with the upcoming Quantum Encryption and Science Satellite (QEYSSat) mission. We conducted ground site characterization studies at three locations in Canada: Waterloo, Ontario, Calgary, Alberta, and Priddis, Alberta. Using different methods we estimate the background counts expected to leak into the satellite-ground quantum channel, and determined whether the noise levels could prevent a quantum key transfer. We also investigate how satellite data recorded from the Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) can help estimate conditions of a particular site, and find reasonable agreement with the locally recorded data. Our results indicate that the Waterloo, Calgary, and Priddis QGS sites should allow both quantum uplinks and downlinks with QEYSSat, despite their proximity to urban centres. Furthermore, our approach allows the use of satellite borne instrument data (VIIRS) to remotely and efficiently determine the potential of a ground site.

TI Fabrication of superconducting qubits and auxiliary devices with niobium
   base layer
SO ACTA PHYSICA SINICA
AB Over the past two decades significant advances have been made in the research of superconducting quantum computing and quantum simulation, in particular of the device design and fabrication that leads to ever-increasing superconducting qubit coherence times and scales. With Google's announcement of the realization of "quantum supremacy", superconducting quantum computing has attracted even more attention. Superconducting qubits are macroscopic objects with quantum properties such as quantized energy levels and quantum-state superposition and entanglement. Their quantum states can be precisely manipulated by tuning the magnetic flux, charge, and phase difference of the Josephson junctions with nonlinear inductance through electromagnetic pulse signals, thereby implementing the quantum information processing. They have advantages in many aspects and are expected to become the central part of universal quantum computing. Superconducting qubits and auxiliary devices prepared with niobium or other hard metals like tantalum as bottom layers of large-area components have unique properties and potentials for further development. In this paper the research work in this area is briefly reviewed, starting from the design and working principle of a variety of superconducting qubits, to the detailed procedures of substrate selection and pretreatment, film growth, pattern transfer, etching, and Josephson junction fabrication, and finally the practical superconducting qubit and their auxiliary device fabrications with niobium base layers are also presented. We aim to provide a clear overview for the fabrication process of these superconducting devices as well as an outlook for further device improvement and optimization in order to help establish a perspective for future progress.

TI Fast Wide-Field Quantum Sensor Based on Solid-State Spins Integrated

SO ADVANCED QUANTUM TECHNOLOGIES
AB Achieving fast, sensitive, and parallel measurement of a large number of quantum particles is an essential task in building large-scale quantum platforms for different quantum information processing applications such as sensing, computation, simulation, and communication. Current quantum platforms in experimental atomic and optical physics based on CMOS sensors and charged coupled device cameras are limited by either low sensitivity or slow operational speed. Here an array of single-photon avalanche diodes is integrated with solid-state spin defects in diamond to build a fast wide-field quantum sensor, achieving a frame rate up to 100 kHz. The design of the experimental setup to perform spatially resolved imaging of quantum systems is presented. A few exemplary applications, including sensing DC and AC magnetic fields, temperature, strain, local spin density, and charge dynamics, are experimentally demonstrated using a nitrogen-vacancy ensemble diamond sample. The developed photon detection array is broadly applicable to other platforms such as atom arrays trapped in optical tweezers, optical lattices, donors in silicon, and rare earth ions in solids.

AB Coalition Structure Generation (CSG) is an NP-Hard problem in which agents are partitioned into mutually exclusive groups to maximize their social welfare. In this work, we propose QuACS, a novel hybrid quantum-classical algorithm for Coalition Structure Generation in Induced Subgraph Games (ISGs). Starting from a coalition structure where all the agents belong to a single coalition, QuACS recursively identifies the optimal partition into two disjoint subsets. This problem is reformulated as a QUBO and then solved using QAOA. Given an n-agent ISG, we show that the proposed algorithm outperforms existing approximate classical solvers with a runtime of O(n(2)) and an expected approximation ratio of 92%. Furthermore, it requires a significantly lower number of qubits and allows experiments on medium-sized problems compared to existing quantum solutions. To show the effectiveness of QuACS we perform experiments on standard benchmark datasets using quantum simulation.

TI Connections between Weyl geometry, quantum potential and quantum
   entanglement
SO MODERN PHYSICS LETTERS A
AB The Weyl geometry promises potential applications in gravity and quantum mechanics. We study the relationships between the Weyl geometry, quantum entropy and quantum entanglement based on the Weyl geometry endowing the Euclidean metric. We give the formulation of the Weyl Ricci curvature and Weyl scalar curvature in the n-dimensional system. The Weyl scalar field plays a bridge role to connect the Weyl scalar curvature, quantum potential and quantum entanglement. We also give the Einstein-Weyl tensor and the generalized field equation in 3D vacuum case, which reveals the relationship between Weyl geometry and quantum potential. Particularly, we find that the correspondence between the Weyl scalar curvature and quantum potential is dimension-dependent and works only for the 3D space, which reveals a clue to quantize gravity and an understanding why our space must be 3D if quantum gravity is compatible with quantum mechanics. We analyze numerically a typical example of two orthogonal oscillators to reveal the relationships between the Weyl scalar curvature, quantum potential and quantum entanglement based on this formulation. We find that the Weyl scalar curvature shows a negative dip peak for separate state but becomes a positive peak for the entangled state near original point region, which can be regarded as a geometric signal to detect quantum entanglement.

TI Hybrid Quantum-Classical Inception Neural Network for Image
   Classification
SO ADVANCED QUANTUM TECHNOLOGIES
AB The advantages of quantum neural networks in image classification have been demonstrated in recent studies, but as the number of network layers increases, the model becomes difficult to train and performs poorly. In addition, research on selecting appropriate quantum circuits for the models is still scarce. Therefore, in order to solve these problems, in this paper, based on parameterized quantum circuits, a hybrid quantum-classical Inception neural network model for image classification is proposed. This model integrates three parallel feature extraction layers: a quantum layer, a classical layer and a hybrid quantum-classical layer, which can fully utilize the advantages of quantum high-dimensional computation and classical large-scale processing. In addition, the interplay between the expressibility and entanglement of quantum circuits and the model's performance is explored, offering insights for future research. Experimental results on the CIFAR-10 dataset demonstrate that the model achieves significantly higher classification accuracy compared to several existing approaches.

TI Entanglement manipulation through multicore fibres
SO PHYSICA SCRIPTA
AB Multicore fibres are recently gaining considerable attention in the context of quantum communication, where their capability to transmit multiple quantum states along different cores of the same channel makes them a promising candidate for the implementation of scalable quantum networks. Here, we show that multicore fibres can be effectively used not only for the scope of communication but also for the manipulation of entangled states. Exploiting the formalism of completely positive trace-preserving maps, we describe the action of a multicore fibre as a quantum channel and investigate the propagation of a transmitted state under the effect of decoherence and inter-core crosstalk. Then, we propose a novel protocol for the manipulation of the entanglement where, starting from a maximally entangled state of two qudits, we use a multicore fibre to create new families of mixed entangled states. Notably, the presence of crosstalk is fundamental for the generation of such states.

TI Higher-rate relativistic quantum key distribution
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB One of the major problems in the field of quantum key distribution (QKD) is the low key rates at which the systems operate. The reasons for this are the processes used to ensure the key distribution itself: sifting, parameter estimation, key reconciliation, and privacy amplification. So, this reduction in the rate of communication is inherent to all existing quantum key distribution schemes. This paper is concerned with proposing a solution to mitigate the rate reduction of the so-called relativistic QKD. To mitigate the reduction, we introduce a modified relativistic QKD protocol, which is based on Mach-Zehnder interferometer being used as a probabilistic basis selection system (basis misalignment occurs between the parties in approximately half of the transferred qubits). The interferometric scheme allows the participating parties to correlate the mutual unbiased bases (MUBs) chosen by them. In this regard, a qubit could be used to transfer more than one bit of information. To be precise, by implementing the proposed interferometric scheme into a relativistic QKD protocol, a qubit is able to transfer two bits of information. This results in achieving a protocol, which is characterized with a greater rate of communication, two times greater than the usual rate. The modified protocol is proven to be secure against intercept-resend and collective attacks.

TI A Novel Security Survival Model for Quantum Key Distribution Networks
   Enabled by Software-Defined Networking
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB Quantum key distribution (QKD) is a technique for distributing symmetric encryption keys securely using quantum physics. The rate of key distribution is low and decreases exponentially with increasing distance. A classic trusted relay (CTR) uses additional keys to enhance security distance in QKD networks. In practice, the assurance of security for certain relay nodes is still lacking, despite the fact that CTR requires that all nodes be trusted. Owing to channel unreliability, system faults accumulate during the key relay, thereby increasing the probability of CTR failing to distribute the secret key. The failure of a successful key relay would then result in the subsequent destruction of all the keys involved in the process, which leads to the wasting of the quantum secret key and reduction system encryption. Hence, alleviating the effect of CTR failure for the purpose of obtaining key security distribution of distant quantum network is necessary issue to tackle. Therefore, a new scheme is needed in order to overcome the above-mentioned issues to come up with a better utilization of the generated keys. In this study, a software-defined networking (SDN) technique is introduced to circumvent this drawback by utilising the flexibility provided by the SDN paradigm for better QKD network management. In particular, a novel survivability model called software-defined quantum key relay failure (SDQKRF) is proposed in this paper in which a new function is developed and added to the SDN controller. According to the simulation results, SDN over a QKD network using the SDQKRF model is more reliable and performs better in terms of the key generation ratio, key utilisation rate, recovery after failure, avalanche effect, and service blocking rate than a regular QKD network without the SDQTRF model.

TI Evaluating Energy Differences on a Quantum Computer with Robust Phase
   Estimation
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB We adapt the robust phase estimation algorithm to the evaluation of energy differences between two eigenstates using a quantum computer. This approach does not require controlled unitaries between auxiliary and system registers or even a single auxiliary qubit. As a proof of concept, we calculate the energies of the ground state and low-lying electronic excitations of a hydrogen molecule in a minimal basis on a cloud quantum computer. The denominative robustness of our approach is then quantified in terms of a high tolerance to coherent errors in the state preparation and measurement. Conceptually, we note that all quantum phase estimation algorithms ultimately evaluate eigenvalue differences.

TI Mimicking classical noise in ion channels by quantum decoherence
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB The mechanism of selectivity in ion channels is still an open question in biology. Recent studies suggest that the selectivity filter may exhibit quantum coherence, which could help explain how ions are selected and conducted. However, environmental noise causes decoherence and loss of quantum effects. It is hoped that the effect of classical noise on ion channels can be modeled using the framework provided by quantum decoherence theory. In this paper, the behavior of the ion channel system was simulated using two models: the Spin-Boson model and the stochastic Hamiltonian model under classical noise. Additionally, using a different approach, the system's evolution was modeled as a two-level Spin-Boson model with tunneling, interacting with a bath of harmonic oscillators, based on decoherence theory. We investigated under what conditions the decoherence model approaches and deviates from the noise model. Specifically, we examined Gaussian noise and Ornstein-Uhlenbeck noise in our model. Gaussian noise shows a very good agreement with the decoherence model. By examining the results, it was found that the Spin-Boson model at a high hopping rate of potassium ions can simulate the behavior of the system in the classical noise approach for Gaussian noise.

TI Early Fault-Tolerant Quantum Algorithms in Practice: Application to
   Ground-State Energy Estimation
SO QUANTUM
AB We investigate the feasibility of early fault-tolerant quantum algorithms focusing on ground-state energy estimation problems. In particular, we examine the computation of the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the spectral measure of a Hamiltonian and the identification of its discontinuities. Scaling these methods to larger system sizes reveals three key challenges: the smoothness of the CDF for large supports, the lack of tight lower bounds on the overlap with the true ground state, and the difficulty of preparing high-quality initial states. To address these challenges, we propose a signal processing approach to find these estimates automatically, in the regime where the quality of the initial state is unknown. Rather than aiming for exact ground-state energy, we advocate for improving classical estimates by targeting the low-energy support of the initial state. Additionally, we provide quantitative resource estimates, demonstrating a constant-factor improvement in the number of samples required to detect a specified change in CDF. Our numerical experiments, conducted on a 26-qubit fully connected Heisenberg model, leverage a truncated density-matrix renormalization group (DMRG) initial state with a low bond dimension. The results show that the predictions from the quantum algorithm align closely with the DMRG-converged energies at larger bond dimensions while requiring several orders of magnitude fewer samples than theoretical estimates suggest. These findings underscore that CDF-based quantum algorithms are a practical and resource-efficient alternative to quantum phase estimation, particularly in resource-constrained scenarios.

TI Comparing Natural Language Processing and Quantum Natural Processing
   approaches in text classification tasks
SO EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS
AB Quantum physics and mechanics have demonstrated significant advances and promising results in different areas using the current near-term devices. One emerging subarea in quantum machine learning is quantum natural language processing, which combines quantum computing advantages and speedups with language processing algorithms to create and perform natural language tasks such as text classification or generation. The libraries and toolboxes used in this subarea include DisCoPy and lambeq, which are used to transform sentences into string diagrams or monoidal functors, convert these diagrams into quantum circuits or ansatz and embed it into a quantum model. In this study, we used both libraries with different text-based datasets to perform sentiment analysis via classification. To do so, we create synthetic datasets to train the different models. After we obtain satisfactory results, we test the resulting models with known datasets. Despite its promising results, quantum natural language processing is far from achieving its full potential. To achieve this potential, the quantum software and hardware must be improved to make them suitable for use with more extensive and complex datasets and other tasks.

TI Quantum Network with Magnonic and Mechanical Nodes
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB A quantum network consisting of magnonic and mechanical nodes connected by light is proposed. Recent years have witnessed a significant development in cavity magnonics based on collective spin excitations in ferrimagnetic crystals, such as yttrium iron garnet (YIG). Magnonic systems are considered to be a promising building block for a future quantum network. However, a major limitation of the system is that the coherence time of the magnon excitations is limited by their intrinsic loss (typically in the order of 1 mu s for YIG). Here, we show that by coupling the magnonic system to a mechanical system using optical pulses, an arbitrary magnonic state (either classical or quantum) can be transferred to and stored in a distant long-lived mechanical resonator. The fidelity depends on the pulse parameters and the transmission loss. We further show that the magnonic and mechanical nodes can be prepared in a macroscopic entangled state. These demonstrate the quantum state transfer and entanglement distribution in such a novel quantum network of magnonic and mechanical nodes. Our work shows the possibility to connect two separate fields of optomagnonics and optomechanics, and to build a long-distance quantum network based on magnonic and mechanical systems.

TI Effects of classical fluctuating environments on decoherence and
   bipartite quantum correlations dynamics
SO LASER PHYSICS
AB We address the time evolution of quantum correlations (QC) such as entanglement, purity, and coherence for a model of two non-interacting qubits initially prepared as a maximally entangled bipartite state. We contrast the comparative potential of the classical fields to preserve these QCs in the noisy and noiseless realms. We also disclose the characteristic dynamical behavior of the QCs of the two-qubit state under the static noise effects originating from the common and different configuration models. We show that there is a direct connection between the fluctuations allowed by an environment and the preservation of QCs. Due to the static noise dephasing effects, the QCs are suppressed, resulting in the separability of the two-qubit entangled state after a finite duration. For bipartite QCs preservation, we show that the common configuration is more resourceful than the different configuration. Furthermore, this protection of the QCs under static noise for large intervals is entirely attributable to the existence of the entanglement sudden death and birth phenomenon. Most importantly, we found the bipartite QCs less fragile than the tripartite ones in comparison under the static noise. In addition, we find the concurrence measure to show more evident revivals of entanglement in comparison.

SO RESULTS IN PHYSICS
AB We propose a hybrid cavity-magnon optomechanical system incorporating mechanical nonlinearity to enhance both bipartite and tripartite entanglement. This system consists of a microwave cavity, a YIG sphere, and a mechanical oscillator. Our findings demonstrate a significant amplification of both bipartite and tripartite entanglement by exploiting the advantages offered by mechanical nonlinearity. Additionally, the entanglement generated by this system exhibits superior temperature robustness compared to conventional ones. Moreover, we determine the optimal parameters of the system that yield maximum bipartite entanglement through rigorous calculations. A big feature to distinguish our proposal from others is the separation of phonon and magnon, and the other one is the use of mechanical nonlinearity to enhance entanglement, which may facilitate quantum precision measurements and quantum communication capabilities.

TI NR-QNN: Noise-Resilient Quantum Neural Network
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB Quantum Neural Networks (QNNs) based on parameterized quantum circuits (PQCs) are gaining significant research attention due to their potential to achieve quantum advantages on Near-Term Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) computers. However, executing QNNs on NISQ devices is challenging due to quantum noise. To address this, we propose a noise-resilient QNN (NR-QNN) that leverages the unique characteristics of PQCs to perform noise-aware optimizations during the inference stage of QNNs. Specifically, NR-QNN employs two optimization techniques to mitigate the impact of noise on QNNs: quantum pruning and sensitivity-aware qubit mapping. The first technique is quantum pruning which identifies gates with small angle of rotations and removes them to simplify circuit of QNNs. The second optimization technique is sensitivity-aware qubit mapping which maps more important logical qubits to more reliable physical qubits. This technique is based on the observation that there can be variation in the sensitivity of an output to input qubits in a QNN. NR-QNN exploits this variability and guides qubit allocation to use reliable physical qubits for sensitive logical qubits. Our evaluation on a real quantum computer demonstrates that NR-QNN enhances the robustness of QNNs, enabling them to operate effectively on NISQ devices.

By encoding classical data into quantum states through angle embedding and employing a robustly entangled 9-qubit circuit design with an SU(4) gate, we developed a Quantum Convolutional Neural Network (QCNN) and compared it to a classical CNN of similar architecture. Our QCNN model, leveraging two quantum circuits as convolutional layers, achieved an impressive peak training accuracy of 76.66% and a validation accuracy of 87.17% at a learning rate of 1 x 10-2. In contrast, the classical CNN model attained a training accuracy of 77.52% and a validation accuracy of 83.33%. These compelling results highlight the potential of quantum circuits to serve as effective convolutional layers for feature extraction in image classification, especially with small datasets.

TI PULSEE: A software for the quantum simulation of an extensive set of
   magnetic resonance observables
SO COMPUTER PHYSICS COMMUNICATIONS
AB We present an open-source software for simulation of observables in magnetic resonance experiments, including nuclear magnetic/quadrupole resonance NMR/NQR and electron spin resonance (ESR). Inspired by magnetic resonance protocols that emerged in the context of quantum information science (QIS), this software can assist experimental research in the design of new strategies for the investigation of fundamental quantum properties of materials. The package introduced here can simulate both standard NMR spectroscopic observables and the time-evolution of an interacting single-spin system subject to complex pulse sequences, i.e. quantum gates. The main purpose of this software is to facilitate the development of much needed novel NMR-based probes of emergent quantum order, which can be elusive to standard experimental probes. The software is based on a quantum mechanical description of nuclear spin dynamics in NMR/NQR experiments and has been widely tested on available theoretical and experimental results. Moreover, the structure of the software allows for basic experiments to be easily generalized to more sophisticated ones because it includes all the libraries required for the numerical simulation of generic spin systems. In order to make the program easily accessible to a large user base, we developed a user-friendly graphical interface, Jupyter notebooks, and fully-detailed documentation. Lastly, we portray several examples of the execution of the code that illustrate the prosepcts of a novel NMR paradigm, inspired by QIS, for efficient investigation of emergent phases in strongly correlated materials.

AB The future Quantum Internet is expected to be based on a hybrid architecture with core quantum transport capabilities complemented by conventional networking. Practical and foundational considerations indicate the need for conventional control and data planes that (i) utilize extensive existing telecommunications fiber infrastructure, and (ii) provide parallel conventional data channels needed for quantum networking protocols. We propose a quantum-conventional network (QCN) harness to implement a new architecture to meet these requirements. The QCN control plane carries the control and management traffic, whereas its data plane handles the conventional and quantum data communications. We established a local area QCN connecting three quantum laboratories over dedicated fiber and conventional network connections. We describe considerations and tradeoffs for layering QCN functionalities, informed by our recent quantum entanglement distribution experiments conducted over this network.

TI Bethe Ansatz, quantum circuits, and the F-basis
SO SCIPOST PHYSICS
AB The Bethe Ansatz is a method for constructing exact eigenstates of quantum-integrable spin chains. Recently, deterministic quantum algorithms, referred to as "algebraic Bethe circuits", have been developed to prepare Bethe states for the spin-1/2 XXZ model. These circuits represent a unitary formulation of the standard algebraic Bethe Ansatz, expressed using matrix-product states that act on both the spin chain and an auxiliary space. In this work, we systematize these previous results, and show that algebraic Bethe circuits can be derived by a change of basis in the auxiliary space. The new basis, identical to the "F-basis" known from the theory of quantum-integrable models, generates the linear superposition of plane waves that is characteristic of the coordinate Bethe Ansatz. We explain this connection, highlighting that certain properties of the F-basis (namely, the exchange symmetry of the spins) are crucial for the construction of algebraic Bethe circuits. We demonstrate our approach by presenting new quantum circuits for the inhomogeneous spin-1/2 XXZ model.

TI Theory for the Beam Splitter in Quantum Optics: Quantum Entanglement of
   Photons and Their Statistics, HOM Effect
SO MATHEMATICS
AB The theory of the beam splitter (BS) in quantum optics is well developed and based on fairly simple mathematical and physical foundations. This theory has been developed for any type of BS and is based on the constancy of the reflection coefficients R (or the transmission coefficient T, where R+T=1) and the phase shift phi. It has recently been shown that the constancy of these coefficients cannot always be satisfied for a waveguide BS, where R and phi depend in a special way on photon frequencies. Based on this, this review systematizes the concept of BS in quantum optics into "Conventional " and frequency-dependent BS, and also presents the theory of such BS. It is shown that the quantum entanglement, photon statistics at the output ports, and the Hong-Ou-Mandel (HOM) effect for such BS can be very different. Taking into account the fact that the waveguide BS is currently acquiring an important role in quantum technologies due to the possibility of its miniaturization, this review will be useful not only for theoreticians, but also for experimenters.

TI A shuttling-based two-qubit logic gate for linking distant silicon
   quantum processors
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Control of entanglement between qubits at distant quantum processors using a two-qubit gate is an essential function of a scalable, modular implementation of quantum computation. Among the many qubit platforms, spin qubits in silicon quantum dots are promising for large-scale integration along with their nanofabrication capability. However, linking distant silicon quantum processors is challenging as two-qubit gates in spin qubits typically utilize short-range exchange coupling, which is only effective between nearest-neighbor quantum dots. Here we demonstrate a two-qubit gate between spin qubits via coherent spin shuttling, a key technology for linking distant silicon quantum processors. Coherent shuttling of a spin qubit enables efficient switching of the exchange coupling with an on/off ratio exceeding 1000, while preserving the spin coherence by 99.6% for the single shuttling between neighboring dots. With this shuttling-mode exchange control, we demonstrate a two-qubit controlled-phase gate with a fidelity of 93%, assessed via randomized benchmarking. Combination of our technique and a phase coherent shuttling of a qubit across a large quantum dot array will provide feasible path toward a quantum link between distant silicon quantum processors, a key requirement for large-scale quantum computation.

TI In situ three-dimensional strain engineering of solid-state quantum
   emitters in photonic structures towards scalable quantum networks
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Solid-state quantum emitters are pivotal for modern photonic quantum technology, yet their inherent spectral inhomogeneity imposes a critical challenge in pursuing scalable quantum network. Here, we develop a cryogenic-compatible strain-engineering platform based on a polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) stamp, which we show can also work properly at cryogenic temperature. In-situ three-dimensional (3D) strain control is achieved for quantum dots (QDs) embedded in photonic nanostructures. The compliant PDMS enables independent tuning of emission energy and strong reduction of fine structure splitting (FSS) of single QDs, as demonstrated by a 7 meV spectral shift with a near-vanishing FSS in circular Bragg resonators and an unprecedented 15 meV tuning range in the micropillar. The PDMS-based 3D strain-engineering platform, compatible with diverse photonic structures at cryogenic temperature, provides a powerful and versatile tool for exploring fundamental strain-related physics and advancing integrated photonic quantum technology.

TI High-efficiency realization of the super-robust Rydberg Deutsch gate
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Quantum logic gates are the essential components of quantum computation and have broad practical applications, especially for the multiple-qubit logic gates. Compared with appliying a series of single- and two-qubit gates, constrcuting quantum computation with multiple-qubit logic gates can be more efficient and high-fidelity. As a three-qubit logic gate, Deutsch gate enables the realization of any feasible quantum computations. Based on neutral atoms, we present a scheme of super -robust Deutsch gate via optimal control technique. Utilizing the Rydberg blockade effect of neutral atoms, we design an implementable D( beta ) based on the three -step program. One of the notable advantages of this function is that beta can be achieved arbitrarily between 0 and pi with the operation of target atom. In addition, we give an analytical solution agreed very well with numerical simulations for the residual blocking effect between next -neighbor atoms that affects the performance quality of Deutsch gate. The fidelity of our proposed scheme is demonstrated by numerical simulation of the master equation based on the full Hamiltonian, and the robustness of our scheme with control errors is also illustrated. Our proposal offers an alternative promising scheme for fault -tolerant quantum computation.

TI A Language for Quantifying Quantum Network Behavior
SO PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACM ON PROGRAMMING LANGUAGES-PACMPL
AB Quantum networks have capabilities that are impossible to achieve using only classical information. They connect quantum capable nodes, with their fundamental unit of communication being the Bell pair, a pair of entangled quantum bits. Due to the nature of quantum phenomena, Bell pairs are fragile and difficult to transmit over long distances, thus requiring a network of repeaters along with dedicated hardware and software to ensure the desired results. The intrinsic challenges associated with quantum networks, such as competition over shared resources and high probabilities of failure, require quantitative reasoning about quantum network protocols. This paper develops PBKAT, an expressive language for specification, verification and optimization of quantum network protocols for Bell pair distribution. Our language is equipped with primitives for expressing probabilistic and possibilistic behaviors, and with semantics modeling protocol executions. We establish the properties of PBKAT's semantics, which we use for quantitative analysis of protocol behavior. We further implement a tool to automate PBKAT's usage, which we evaluated on real-world protocols drawn from the literature. Our results indicate that PBKAT is well suited for both expressing real-world quantum network protocols and reasoning about their quantitative properties.

TI Challenges and Solutions for Secure Key Management and Monitoring:
   Review of the Cerberis3 Quantum Key Distribution System
SO QUANTUM REPORTS
AB Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) offers a revolutionary approach to secure communication, leveraging the principles of quantum mechanics to generate and distribute cryptographic keys that are immune to eavesdropping. As QKD systems become more widely adopted, the need for robust monitoring and management solutions has become increasingly crucial. The Cerberis3 QKD system from ID Quantique addresses this challenge by providing a comprehensive monitoring and visualization platform. The system's advanced features, including central configuration, SNMP integration, and the graphical visualization of key performance metrics, enable network administrators to ensure their QKD infrastructure's reliable and secure operation. Monitoring critical parameters such as Quantum Bit Error Rate (QBER), secret key rate, and link visibility is essential for maintaining the integrity of the quantum channel and optimizing the system's performance. The Cerberis3 system's ability to interface with encryption vendors and support complex network topologies further enhances its versatility and integration capabilities. By addressing the unique challenges of quantum monitoring, the Cerberis3 system empowers organizations to leverage the power of QKD technology, ensuring the security of their data in the face of emerging quantum computing threats. This article explores the Cerberus3 system's features and its role in overcoming the monitoring challenges inherent to QKD deployments.

TI Maximal quantum entanglement at exceptional points via unitary and
   thermal dynamics
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Minimal, open quantum systems that are governed by non-Hermitian Hamiltonians have been realized across multiple platforms in the past two years. Here we investigate the dynamics of open systems with Hermitian or anti-Hermitian Hamiltonians, both of which can be implemented in such platforms. For a single system, the subject to unitary and thermal dynamics in a periodic manner, we show that the corresponding Floquet Hamiltonian has a rich phase diagram with numerous exceptional-point (EP) degeneracy contours. This protocol can be used to realize a quantum Hatano-Nelson model that is characterized by asymmetric tunneling. For one unitary and one thermal qubit, we show that the concurrence is maximized at the EP that is controlled by the strength of Hermitian coupling between them. Surprisingly, the entropy of each qubit is also maximized at the EP. Our results point to the multifarious phenomenology of systems undergoing unitary and thermal dynamics.

TI Roots of quantum computing supremacy: superposition, entanglement, or
   complementarity?
SO EUROPEAN PHYSICAL JOURNAL-SPECIAL TOPICS
AB The recent claim of Google to have brought forth a breakthrough in quantum computing represents a major impetus to further analyze the foundations for any claims of superiority regarding quantum algorithms. This note attempts to present a conceptual step in this direction. I start with a critical analysis of what is commonly referred to as entanglement and quantum nonlocality and whether or not these concepts may be the basis of quantum superiority. Bell-type experiments are then interpreted as statistical tests of Bohr's principle of complementarity (PCOM), which is, thus, given a foothold within the area of quantum informatics and computation. PCOM implies (by its connection to probability) that probabilistic algorithms may proceed without the knowledge of joint probability distributions (jpds). The computation of jpds is exponentially time consuming. Consequently, classical probabilistic algorithms, involving the computation of jpds for n random variables, can be outperformed by quantum algorithms (for large values of n). Quantum probability theory (QPT) modifies the classical formula for the total probability (FTP). Inference based on the quantum version of FTP leads to a constructive interference that increases the probability of some events and reduces that of others. The physical realization of this probabilistic advantage is based on the discreteness of quantum phenomena (as opposed to the continuity of classical phenomena).

TI Open source variational quantum eigensolver extension of the quantum
   learning machine for quantum chemistry
SO WILEY INTERDISCIPLINARY REVIEWS-COMPUTATIONAL MOLECULAR SCIENCE
AB Quantum chemistry (QC) is one of the most promising applications of quantum computing. However, present quantum processing units (QPUs) are still subject to large errors. Therefore, noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) hardware is limited in terms of qubit counts/circuit depths. Variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) algorithms can potentially overcome such issues. Here, we introduce the OpenVQE open-source QC package. It provides tools for using and developing chemically-inspired adaptive methods derived from unitary coupled cluster (UCC). It facilitates the development and testing of VQE algorithms and is able to use the Atos Quantum Learning Machine (QLM), a general quantum programming framework enabling to write/optimize/simulate quantum computing programs. We present a specific, freely available QLM open-source module, myQLM-fermion. We review its key tools for facilitating QC computations (fermionic second quantization, fermion-spin transforms, etc.). OpenVQE largely extends the QLM's QC capabilities by providing: (i) the functions to generate the different types of excitations beyond the commonly used UCCSD ansatz; (ii) a new Python implementation of the "adaptive derivative assembled pseudo-Trotter method" (ADAPT-VQE). Interoperability with other major quantum programming frameworks is ensured thanks to the myQLM-interop package, which allows users to build their own code and easily execute it on existing QPUs. The combined OpenVQE/myQLM-fermion libraries facilitate the implementation, testing and development of variational quantum algorithms, while offering access to large molecules as the noiseless Schrodinger-style dense simulator can reach up to 41 qubits for any circuit. Extensive benchmarks are provided for molecules associated to qubit counts ranging from 4 to 24. We focus on reaching chemical accuracy, reducing the number of circuit gates and optimizing parameters and operators between "fixed-length" UCC and ADAPT-VQE ansatze.This article is categorized under:Software > Quantum ChemistryQuantum Computing > Algorithms

TI Digitized adiabatic quantum factorization
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Quantum integer factorization is a potential quantum computing solution that may revolutionize cryptography. Nevertheless, a scalable and efficient quantum algorithm for noisy intermediate-scale quantum computers looks far-fetched. We propose an alternative factorization method, within the digitized-adiabatic quantum computing paradigm, by digitizing an adiabatic quantum factorization algorithm enhanced by shortcuts to adiabaticity techniques. We find that this fast factorization algorithm is suitable for available gate-based quantum computers. We test our quantum algorithm in an IBM quantum computer with up to six qubits, surpassing the performance of the more commonly used factorization algorithms on the long way towards quantum advantage.

TI Bias-field digitized counterdiabatic quantum algorithm for higher-order
   binary optimization
SO COMMUNICATIONS PHYSICS
AB Combinatorial optimization plays a crucial role in many industrial applications. While classical computing often struggles with complex instances, quantum optimization emerges as a promising alternative. Here, we present an enhanced bias-field digitized counterdiabatic quantum optimization (BF-DCQO) algorithm to address higher-order unconstrained binary optimization (HUBO). We apply BF-DCQO to a HUBO problem featuring three-local terms in the Ising spin-glass model, validated experimentally using 156 qubits on an IBM quantum processor. In the studied instances, our results outperform standard methods such as the quantum approximate optimization algorithm, quantum annealing, simulated annealing, and Tabu search. Furthermore, we provide numerical evidence of the feasibility of a similar HUBO problem on a 433-qubit Osprey-like quantum processor. Finally, we solve denser instances of the MAX 3-SAT problem in an IonQ emulator. Our results show that BF-DCQO offers an effective path for solving large-scale HUBO problems on current and near-term quantum processors.

TI Trapped-ion quantum simulation of collective neutrino oscillations
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW D
AB It is well known that the neutrino flavor in extreme astrophysical environments changes under the effect of three contributions: the vacuum oscillation, the interaction with the surrounding matter, and the collective oscillations due to interactions between different neutrinos. The latter adds a nonlinear contribution to the equations of motion, making the description of their dynamics complex. In this work we study various strategies to simulate the coherent collective oscillations of a system of N neutrinos in the two-flavor approximation using quantum computation. This was achieved by using a pair-neutrino decomposition designed to account for the fact that the flavor Hamiltonian, in the presence of the neutrino -neutrino term, presents an all-to-all interaction that makes the implementation of the evolution dependent on the qubit topology. We analyze the Trotter error caused by the decomposition demonstrating that the complexity of the implementation of time evolution scales polynomially with the number of neutrinos and that the noise from near-term quantum device simulation can be reduced by optimizing the quantum circuit decomposition and exploiting a full-qubit connectivity. We find that the gate complexity using second order Trotter-Suzuki formulas scales better with system size than with other decomposition methods such as quantum signal processing. We finally present the application and the results of our algorithm on a real quantum device based on trapped-ion qubits.

AB Diagrammatic representations of quantum algorithms and circuits offer novel approaches to their design and analysis. In this work, we describe extensions of the ZX-calculus especially suitable for parameterized quantum circuits, in particular for computing observable expectation values as functions of or for fixed parameters, which are important algorithmic quantities in a variety of applications ranging from combinatorial optimization to quantum chemistry. We provide several new ZX-diagram rewrite rules and generalizations for this setting. In particular, we give formal rules for dealing with linear combinations of ZX-diagrams, where the relative complex-valued scale factors of each diagram must be kept track of, in contrast to most previously studied single-diagram realizations where these coefficients can be effectively ignored. This allows us to directly import a number useful relations from the operator analysis to ZX-calculus setting, including causal cone and quantum gate commutation rules. We demonstrate that the diagrammatic approach offers useful insights into algorithm structure and performance by considering several ansatze from the literature including realizations of hardware-efficient ansatze and QAOA. We find that by employing a diagrammatic representation, calculations across different ansatze can become more intuitive and potentially easier to approach systematically than by alternative means. Finally, we outline how diagrammatic approaches may aid in the design and study of new and more effective quantum circuit ansatze.

TI Quantum Correlations in Zigzag Graphene Nanoribbons: Effects of Length
   and Magnetic Fields
SO PHYSICA STATUS SOLIDI B-BASIC SOLID STATE PHYSICS
AB In this article, we investigate how various parameters such as the nanoribbon length, temperature, external magnetic field, and Coulomb interactions affect fundamental quantum correlations in zigzag graphene nanoribbons. Using an effective Heisenberg model derived from the Hubbard Hamiltonian, we analyze three essential quantifiers: thermal entanglement, correlated quantum coherence, and local quantum uncertainty. Our results reveal that increasing the ribbon length leads to an exponential reduction of the exchange interaction between edge-localized electronic states, which causes a gradual decrease of thermal entanglement. Both temperature and Coulomb repulsion significantly reduce the concurrence, while quantum coherence and local quantum uncertainty exhibit greater robustness, maintaining nonclassical correlations even at elevated temperatures. Furthermore, the application of an external magnetic field strongly influences these quantum correlations and enhances their sensitivity to thermal and geometric effects. These findings provide a comprehensive understanding of how structural and environmental parameters govern quantum correlations in graphene-based nanostructures, offering valuable insights for the design of stable platforms for quantum information processing and spintronic applications.

AB In this work, we present novel concepts for quantum algorithms to solve transient, nonlinear partial differential equations (PDEs). The challenge lies in how to effectively represent, encode, process, and evolve the nonlinear system of PDEs on quantum computers. We will discuss the new techniques using the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations as an example, because it represents the fundamental nonlinear feature and yet removes certain complexity in physics, allowing us to focus on the design of quantum algorithms. Previous attempts solving nonlinear PDEs in quantum computation have often involved storing multiple copies of solutions or employing linearizations. Neither is practical due to exponential scaling with evolution time or insufficient solution accuracy. We propose a new framework based on matrix product states (MPSs) and matrix product operators (MPOs), in addition to the Krylov subspace methods. For example, the solution variables of the Navier-Stokes equations are represented by MPSs, and the linear and nonlinear terms are processed by MPOs. The time evolution of the operators is attained by a fast-forwarding algorithm using Krylov subspace methods. Furthermore, we discuss various techniques for efficient encoding of MPSs, measurement reduction for MPOs, and use of tensor operations to treat multi-variate, multi-physics characteristics of Navier-Stokes.

TI Statistical analysis and prediction of dynamic UAV-based entanglement
   distribution channel through deep learning
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are a promising platform for flexible quantum communication, complementing fiber and satellite links. However, the performance of UAV-based entanglement distribution is limited by the dynamic atmospheric channel. Traditional statistical models, relying on static assumptions, cannot accurately represent real-time channel variations crucial for optimization. To address this, we propose an AI-driven adaptive prediction framework using the Patch Time Series Transformer (PatchTST) model to forecast UAV-to-ground quantum channel transmittance. Simulations demonstrate that our method accurately predicts dynamic transmittance fluctuations and outperforms standard recurrent neural network benchmarks in capturing relevant channel features. Additionally, it enables reliable estimation of key performance metrics like the BBM92 secure key rate. This work demonstrates an effective deep learning strategy for real-time channel prediction, enhancing adaptive optimization and robustness in UAV-based quantum entanglement distribution.

TI Analysis of a hybrid quantum network for classification tasks

AB In the era of noisy intermediate scaled quantum computers, one of the possible applications to search for an advantage of quantum computing is machine learning. Here, we report about an analysis, where a hybrid quantum-classical network is applied to classify non-trivial datasets (finance and MNIST data). In comparison to a pure classical network, we find an advantage when looking at several performance measures. As in classical machine learning, problems around overfitting the dataset arise. Therefore, we explore different possibilities to regularise the network.

TI Forward and Backward Constrained Bisimulations for Quantum Circuits
   Using Decision Diagrams
SO ACM TRANSACTIONS ON QUANTUM COMPUTING
AB Efficient methods for the simulation of quantum circuits on classical computers are crucial for their analysis due to the exponential growth of the problem size with the number of qubits. Here we study lumping methods based on bisimulation, an established class of techniques that has been proven successful for (classic) stochastic and deterministic systems such as Markov chains and ordinary differential equations. Forward constrained bisimulation yields a lower-dimensional model which exactly preserves quantum measurements projected on a linear subspace of interest. Backward constrained bisimulation gives a reduction that is valid on a subspace containing the circuit input, from which the circuit result can be fully recovered. We provide an algorithm to compute the constraint bisimulations yielding coarsest reductions in both cases, using a duality result relating the two notions. As applications, we provide theoretical bounds on the size of the reduced state space for well-known quantum algorithms for search, optimization, and factorization. Using a prototype implementation, we report significant reductions on a set of benchmarks. In particular, we show that constrained bisimulation can boost decision-diagram-based quantum circuit simulation by several orders of magnitude, allowing thus for substantial synergy effects.

TI Shortcut to chemically accurate quantum computing via density-based
   basis-set correction
SO COMMUNICATIONS CHEMISTRY
AB Using GPU-accelerated state-vector emulation, we propose to embed a quantum computing ansatz into density-functional theory via density-based basis-set corrections to obtain quantitative quantum-chemistry results on molecules that would otherwise require brute-force quantum calculations using hundreds of logical qubits. Indeed, accessing a quantitative description of chemical systems while minimizing quantum resources is an essential challenge given the limited qubit capabilities of current quantum processors. We provide a shortcut towards chemically accurate quantum computations by approaching the complete-basis-set limit through coupling the density-based basis-set corrections approach, applied to any given variational ansatz, to an on-the-fly crafting of basis sets specifically adapted to a given system and user-defined qubit budget. The resulting approach self-consistently accelerates the basis-set convergence, improving electronic densities, ground-state energies, and first-order properties (e.g. dipole moments), but can also serve as a classical, a posteriori, energy correction to quantum hardware calculations with expected applications in drug design and materials science.

TI Transmission of photonic entangled states encoded via eigenstates of
   photon-number parity operator
SO APPLIED PHYSICS LETTERS
AB The transfer of quantum entangled states is of fundamental interest in quantum physics and plays an important role in quantum information processing, quantum communication, and quantum technology. Here, we propose a scheme to transfer quantum entangled states of two photonic qubits by utilizing four microwave cavities coupled to a superconducting qutrit (a three-level quantum system). The photonic qubits are encoded using two orthogonal eigenstates of the photon-number parity operator with eigenvalues +/- 1, which allows for various encodings for the photonic qubits. The employment of four cavities at distinct frequencies effectively reduces the inter-cavity crosstalk. The utilization of only a single superconducting qutrit as the coupler significantly reduces the circuit resources. The entanglement transfer can be completed in just one step, making this scheme remarkably efficient. During the state transfer process, the third energy level of the coupler qutrit remains unoccupied, and thus decoherence from this level is diminished. Our numerical simulations demonstrate that within current circuit quantum electrodynamics technology, one can achieve high-fidelity transfer of the entangled states of two photonic qubits encoded via squeezed vacuum states and cat states. Our scheme possesses generality and can be applied to accomplish the same task in a variety of physical systems.

By varying the ratio between the Coulomb interaction U and the kinetic energy J h ( U / J h ), it was possible to observe changes in the behavior of the system, showing that the simulation carries the physics of the Hubbard model, such as the occurrence of an analog of the crossover from a metallic to a Mott -insulator regime in the limit U >> J h . The experimental results were compared with the theoretic predictions, showing good fidelity. The problem is relevant to the areas of Quantum Computation and Solid State Physics, and establishes a possible new approach to treat the model.

TI Deterministic remote preparation of multi-qubit equatorial states
   through dissipative channels
SO CHINESE PHYSICS B
AB We investigate the influence of a noisy environment on the remote preparation of the multi-qubit equatorial state, and specifically deduce the final states and fidelities of the remote preparation of the three-qubit and four-qubit equatorial states under diverse types of noisy environments, namely, amplitude damping, bit flip, phase damping, phase flip, bit-phase flip, depolarization, and non-Markov environments. The results show that when the decoherence factors of the front six noises are equal, the influence degrees of phase damped noise, bit flip noise, phase flip noise, and bit-phase flip noise are similar, while the information loss caused by the amplitude damped noise and depolarizing noise is less. In particular, the bit flip noise and depolarizing noise may have more complex effects on the remote state preparation (RSP) schemes depending on the phase information of the target states, even for the ideal cases where the fidelity values are always 1 for specific phase relations. In the non-Markov environment, owing to the back and forth of information between the environment and systems, fidelities exhibit oscillating behavior and the minimum value may stay greater than zero for a long evolutionary time. These results are expected to have potential applications for understanding and avoiding the influence of noise on remote quantum communication and quantum networks.

TI Quantum Metrological Power of Continuous-Variable Quantum Networks
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB We investigate the quantum metrological power of typical continuous-variable (CV) quantum networks. Particularly, we show that most CV quantum networks provide an entanglement to quantum states in distant nodes that enables one to achieve the Heisenberg scaling in the number of modes for distributed quantum displacement sensing, which cannot be attained using an unentangled probe state. Notably, our scheme only requires local operations and measurements after generating an entangled probe using the quantum network. In addition, we find a tolerable photon-loss rate that maintains the quantum enhancement. Finally, we numerically demonstrate that even when CV quantum networks are composed of local beam splitters, the quantum enhancement can be attained when the depth is sufficiently large.

TI Boosting Single-Photon Extraction Efficiency in GaN Through Radiative
   Mode Conversion
SO LASER & PHOTONICS REVIEWS
AB Highly stable and bright single-photon emitters at room temperature are fundamental components of quantum information technologies, which support advanced applications such as quantum computing, quantum communication, and quantum sensing. A key challenge in realizing these technologies is the creation of efficient single-photon sources capable of emitting across a broad spectral range. While defect-based materials such as diamond, SiC, 2D materials and III-nitrides show significant promise, broadband single-photon extraction remains a considerable obstacle, often restricted to narrow emission bands through the use of resonant cavities. In this work, a novel approach is introduced to enhance the broadband extraction efficiency of single photons from GaN, a versatile III-nitride material. By directly patterning circular Bragg gratings with partially etched trenches onto the GaN surface, efficient radiation mode conversion, boosting single-photon extraction over a wide spectral bandwidth, is achieved. Crucially, this method eliminates the need for resonant cavities, which rely on precise period control through photolithography to achieve narrow bandwidth resonant modes, thereby supporting efficient extraction from various randomly distributed defects across a broad spectral range. This approach represents a major improvement over previous techniques by offering a practical solution for broadband single-photon extraction from GaN and opening new possibilities for versatile quantum technologies.

TI Quantum algorithms for cooling: A simple case study
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Preparation of low-energy quantum many-body states has a wide range of applications in quantum information processing and condensed-matter physics. Quantum cooling algorithms offer a promising alternative to other methods based, for instance, on variational and adiabatic principles, or on dissipative state preparation. In this work, we investigate a set of cooling algorithms in a simple, solvable fermionic model that allows us to identify the mechanisms that underlie the cooling process and, also, those that prevent it. We derive analytical expressions for the cooling dynamics, steady states, and cooling rates in the weak-coupling limit. We find that multifrequency and randomized cycle strategies can significantly enhance the performance of the quantum algorithm and circumvent some of the obstacles. We also analyze the effects of noise and evaluate the conditions under which cooling remains feasible. Furthermore, we present optimized cooling protocols that can significantly enhance cooling performance in the presence of noise. Additionally, we compare cooling and dissipative state preparation and show that, in the model analyzed here, cooling generally achieves lower energies and is more resilient to noise.

However, such algorithms in their present form require resources that exceed the capabilities of current quantum computers except for a limited range of system sizes and observables. Here, we report calculations of finite-temperature properties, including energy, static and dynamical correlation functions, and excitation spectra of spin systems with up to four sites on five-qubit IBM Quantum devices. These calculations are performed using the quantum imaginary time evolution (QITE) algorithm and made possible by several algorithmic improvements, including a method to exploit symmetries that reduces the quantum resources required by QITE, circuit optimization procedures to reduce circuit depth, and error-mitigation techniques to improve the quality of raw hardware data. Our work demonstrates that the ansatz-independent QITE algorithm is capable of computing diverse finite-temperature observables on near-term quantum devices.

TI High-uniformity atomic layer deposition of superconducting niobium
   nitride thin films for quantum photonic integration
SO MATERIALS FOR QUANTUM TECHNOLOGY
AB Atomic layer deposition (ALD) has been identified as a promising growth method for high-uniformity superconducting thin films for superconducting quantum photonic applications, offering superior uniformity, thickness control and conformality to techniques such as reactive sputtering. The potential scalability of ALD makes this method especially appealing for fabrication of superconducting nanowires and resonators across large areas. We report on the growth of highly uniform superconducting NbN thin films via plasma-enhanced atomic layer deposition (PEALD) with radio frequency substrate biasing, on a 200 mm (8 inch) Si wafer, specifically for superconducting nanowire single-photon detector applications. Niobium nitride films were grown using (tert-butylimido)-tris(diethylamido)-niobium(V) precursor and an H-2/Ar plasma. The superconducting properties of a variable thickness series of films (5.9-29.8 nm) show critical temperature (T-c) of 13.5 K approaching bulk thickness (28.8 nm) with low suppression down to the ultrathin regime (5.9 nm), with T-c = 10.2 K. T-c across the 200 mm wafer with 8 nm thick NbN, measured in 15 mm intervals, exhibits minimal variation (<7%). Microbridge structures fabricated on 8 nm thick NbN films also exhibit high critical current densities (J( c)), > 10 MA cm(-2) at 2.6 K. PEALD could therefore be a pivotal technique in enabling large-scale fabrication of integrated quantum photonic devices across a variety of applications.

TI Deep learning of quantum entanglement from incomplete measurements
SO SCIENCE ADVANCES
AB The quantification of the entanglement present in a physical system is of paramount importance for fundamental research and many cutting-edge applications. Now, achieving this goal requires either a priori knowledge on the system or very demanding experimental procedures such as full state tomography or collective measurements. Here, we demonstrate that, by using neural networks, we can quantify the degree of entanglement without the need to know the full description of the quantum state. Our method allows for direct quantification of the quantum correlations using an incomplete set of local measurements. Despite using undersampled measurements, we achieve a quantification error of up to an order of magnitude lower than the state-of-the-art quantum tomography. Furthermore, we achieve this result using networks trained using exclusively simulated data. Last, we derive a method based on a convolutional network input that can accept data from various measurement scenarios and perform, to some extent, independently of the measurement device.

TI High success perfect transmission of 1-qubit information using
   purposefully delayed sharing of non-maximally entangled 2-qubit resource
   and repeated generalized Bell-state measurements
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF QUANTUM INFORMATION
AB We propose a new scheme in which perfect transmission of 1-qubit information is achieved with high success using purposefully delayed sharing of non-maximally entangled 2-qubit resource and repeated generalized Bell-state measurements (GBSM). Alice possesses initially all qubits and she makes repeated GBSM on the pair of qubits, consisting of (1) the qubit of information state and (2) one of the two entangled resource qubits (taken alternately) until transmission with perfect fidelity is indicated. Alice then sends to Bob, the qubit not used in the last GBSM and also the result of this GBSM and Bob applies a suitable unitary transformation to replicate exactly the information state. Continued probabilistic transmission with unit fidelity is achieved by changing continuously the generalized Bell basis and also the pair of measured qubits of the collapsed states. We calculate the success probability up to the third repeated attempt of GBSM and plot it with concurrence of the entangled resource state. We also discuss the maximal average fidelity.

TI Quantum entanglement of non-Hermitian quasicrystals
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
AB As a hallmark of a pure quantum effect, quantum entanglement has provided unconventional routes to characterize condensed matter systems. Here, from the perspective of quantum entanglement, we disclose exotic quantum physics in non-Hermitian quasicrystals. We study a class of experimentally realizable models for non-Hermitian quasicrystal chains, in which asymmetric hopping and complex potential coexist. We diagnose the global phase diagram by means of entanglement from both the real-space and momentum-space partitions. By measuring the entanglement entropy, we numerically determine the metal-insulator transition point. We com-bine real-space and momentum-space entanglement spectra to complementarily characterize the delocalization phase and the localization phase. Inspired by the entanglement spectrum, we further analytically prove that a duality exists between the two phase regions. The transition point is self-dual and exact, further validating the numerical result from diagonalizing non-Hermitian matrices. Finally, we identify the mobility edge by means of entanglement.

TI Fock-Space Schrieffer-Wolff Transformation: Classically-Assisted
   Rank-Reduced Quantum Phase Estimation Algorithm
SO APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL
AB We present an extension of many-body downfolding methods to reduce the resources required in the quantum phase estimation (QPE) algorithm. In this paper, we focus on the Schrieffer-Wolff (SW) transformation of the electronic Hamiltonians for molecular systems that provides significant simplifications of quantum circuits for simulations of quantum dynamics. We demonstrate that by employing Fock-space variants of the SW transformation (or rank-reducing similarity transformations (RRST)) one can significantly increase the locality of the qubit-mapped similarity-transformed Hamiltonians. The practical utilization of the SW-RRST formalism is associated with a series of approximations discussed in the manuscript. In particular, amplitudes that define RRST can be evaluated using conventional computers and then encoded on quantum computers. The SW-RRST QPE quantum algorithms can also be viewed as an extension of the standard state-specific coupled-cluster downfolding methods to provide a robust alternative to the traditional QPE algorithms to identify the ground and excited states for systems with various numbers of electrons using the same Fock-space representations of the downfolded Hamiltonian. The RRST formalism serves as a design principle for developing new classes of approximate schemes that reduce the complexity of quantum circuits.

TI Bayesian phase difference estimation based on single-photon projective
   measurement
SO CHINESE PHYSICS B
AB The estimation of quantum phase differences plays an important role in quantum simulation and quantum computation, yet existing quantum phase estimation algorithms face critical limitations in noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices due to their excessive depth and circuit complexity. We demonstrate a high-precision phase difference estimation protocol based on the Bayesian phase difference estimation algorithm and single-photon projective measurement. The iterative framework of the algorithm, combined with the independence from controlled unitary operations, inherently mitigates circuit depth and complexity limitations. Through an experimental realization on the photonic system, we demonstrate high-precision estimation of diverse phase differences, showing root-mean-square errors (RMSE) below the standard quantum limit O(1/N) and reaching the Heisenberg scaling O(1/N) after a certain number of iterations. Our scheme provides a critical advantage in quantum resource-constrained scenarios, and advances practical implementations of quantum information tasks under realistic hardware constraints.

TI Quantum sensing and imaging with spin defects in hexagonal boron nitride
SO ADVANCES IN PHYSICS-X
AB Color centers in hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) have recently emerged as promising candidates for a new wave of quantum applications. Thanks to hBN's high stability and two-dimensional (2D) layered structure, color centers in hBN can be readily integrated into nanophotonic and plasmonic structures on a chip. More importantly, the recently discovered optically addressable spin defects in hBN provide a quantum interface between photons and electron spins for quantum sensing applications. The most well-studied hBN spin defects, the negatively charged boron vacancy ( V B - ) spin defects, have been used for quantum sensing of static magnetic fields, magnetic noise, temperature, strain, nuclear spins, paramagnetic spins in liquids, RF signals, and beyond. In particular, hBN nanosheets with spin defects can form van der Waals (vdW) heterostructures with other 2D materials for in situ quantum sensing and imaging. This review summarizes the rapidly evolving field of quantum sensing with spin defects in hBN. We introduce basic properties of hBN spin defects, quantum sensing protocols, and recent experimental demonstrations of quantum sensing and imaging with hBN spin defects. We also discuss methods to enhance their sensitivity. Finally, we envision some potential developments and applications of hBN spin defects.

TI Polarization compensation for entanglement-based quantum key
   distribution
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB In quantum key distribution (QKD) systems using polarization entanglement, channel polarization perturbations significantly compromise both efficiency and security. To address the slow response and instability of current entanglement-based polarization compensation techniques for entanglement-based quantum key distribution, we propose a polarization compensation scheme based on an adaptive gradient descent algorithm. The system's performance is tested over a 10 km single-sided fiber channel. Results show that this scheme maintains long-term stability of the polarization state under both random and periodic perturbations. The average compensation time is 248 ms, with an entanglement source average visibility of 83.43% and an average quantum error rate of 8.28%. This method effectively mitigates polarization perturbation in entanglement-based quantum key distribution (QKD). These results are pivotal for the development of long-distance, multi-node quantum communication networks.

TI Intermodal quantum key distribution field trial with active switching
   between fiber and free-space channels
SO EPJ QUANTUM TECHNOLOGY
AB BackgroundIntermodal quantum key distribution enables the full interoperability of fiber networks and free-space channels, which are both necessary elements for the development of a global quantum network. We present a field trial of an intermodal quantum key distribution system in a simple 3-node heterogeneous quantum network - comprised of two polarization-based transmitters and a single receiver - in which the active channel is alternately switched between a free-space link of 620 m and a 17 km-long deployed fiber in the metropolitan area of Padova.FindingsThe performance of the free-space channel is evaluated against the atmospheric turbulence strength of the link. The field trial lasted for several hours in daylight conditions, attesting the interoperability between fiber and free-space channels, with a secret key rate of the order of kbps for both the channels.ConclusionsThe quantum key distribution hardware and software require no different strategies to work over the two channels, even if the intrinsic characteristics of the links are clearly different.

TI Adaptive Coding-Based Quantum Communication System for Image

AB This work presents a quantum communication system enhanced with adaptive coding, aimed at improving compressed image transmission performance in noisy and error-prone environments. The proposed system integrates Joint Photographic Experts Group (JPEG) and High Efficiency Image Format (HEIF) codecs with polar codes at varying code rates. To maintain consistent bandwidth usage, source coding rates are adapted according to the corresponding channel coding rates. After transmission through the quantum channel, the respective polar and source decoders reconstruct the image. The results show that the adaptive coding-based quantum communication system significantly outperforms equivalent classical systems, especially at low signal-to-noise ratios (SNR), achieving Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR) improvements up to 65 dB and Structural Similarity Index Measure (SSIM) values up to 0.9999 for HEIF images and PSNR values up to 58 dB with SSIM values up to 0.9994 for JPEG images. These findings demonstrate the superior robustness and higher image quality of adaptive coding-based quantum communication in varying channel noise conditions and bandwidth-restricted applications.

TI Exponential Clustering of Bipartite Quantum Entanglement at Arbitrary
   Temperatures
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW X
AB Many inexplicable phenomena in low-temperature many-body physics are a result of macroscopic quantum effects. Such macroscopic quantumness is often evaluated via long-range entanglement, that is, entanglement in the macroscopic length scale. Long-range entanglement is employed to characterize novel quantum phases and serves as a critical resource for quantum computation. However, the conditions under which long-range entanglement is stable, even at room temperatures, remain unclear. In this regard, this study demonstrates the unstable nature of bipartite long-range entanglement at arbitrary temperatures, which exponentially decays with distance. The proposed theorem is a no-go theorem pertaining to the existence of long-range entanglement. The obtained results are consistent with existing observations, indicating that long-range entanglement at nonzero temperatures can exist in topologically ordered phases, where tripartite correlations are dominant. The derivation in this study introduces a quantum correlation defined by the convex roof of the standard correlation function. Further, an exponential clustering theorem for generic quantum many-body systems under such a quantum correlation at arbitrary temperatures is established, which yields the primary result by relating quantum correlation with quantum entanglement. Moreover, a simple application of analytical techniques is demonstrated by deriving a general limit on the Wigner-Yanase-Dyson skew and quantum Fisher information; this is expected to attract significant attention in the field of quantum metrology. Notably, this study reveals the novel, general aspects of lowtemperature quantum physics and clarifies the characterization of long-range entanglement.

TI Resilience of Quantum Random Access Memory to Generic Noise
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB Quantum random access memory (QRAM)-memory which stores classical data but allows queries to be performed in superposition-is required for the implementation of numerous quantum algorithms. While naive implementations of QRAM are highly susceptible to decoherence and hence not scalable, it has been argued that the bucket-brigade QRAM architecture [Giovannetti et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 100, 160501 (2008)] is highly resilient to noise, with the infidelity of a query scaling only logarithmically with the memory size. In prior analyses, however, this favorable scaling followed directly from the use of contrived noise models, thus leaving open the question of whether experimental implementations would actually enjoy the purported scaling advantage. In this work, we study the effects of decoherence on QRAM in full generality. Our main result is a proof that this favorable infidelity scaling holds for arbitrary error channels (including, e.g., depolarizing noise and coherent errors). Our proof identifies the origin of this noise resilience as the limited entanglement among the memory's components, and it also reveals that significant architectural simplifications can be made while preserving the noise resilience. We verify these results numerically using a novel classical algorithm for the efficient simulation of noisy QRAM circuits. Our findings indicate that QRAM can be implemented with existing hardware in realistically noisy devices, and that high-fidelity queries are possible without quantum error correction. Furthermore, we also prove that the benefits of the bucket-brigade architecture persist when quantum error correction is used, in which case the scheme offers improved hardware efficiency and resilience to logical errors.

TI High-Coherence Kerr-Cat Qubit in 2D Architecture
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW X
AB The Kerr-cat qubit is a bosonic qubit in which multiphoton Schr & ouml;dinger cat states are stabilized by applying a two-photon drive to an oscillator with a Kerr nonlinearity. The suppressed bit-flip rate with increasing cat size makes this qubit a promising candidate to implement quantum error correction codes tailored for noise-biased qubits. However, achieving strong light-matter interactions necessary for stabilizing and controlling this qubit has traditionally required strong microwave drives that heat the qubit and degrade its performance. In contrast, increasing the coupling to the drive port removes the need for strong drives at the expense of large Purcell decay. By integrating an effective band-block filter on chip, we overcome this trade-off and realize a Kerr-cat qubit in a scalable 2D superconducting circuit with high coherence. This filter provides 30 dB of isolation at the qubit frequency with negligible attenuation at the frequencies required for stabilization and readout. We experimentally demonstrate quantum nondemolition readout fidelity of 99.6% for a cat with eight photons. Also, to have high-fidelity universal control over this qubit, we combine fast Rabi oscillations with a new demonstration of the X ( pi / 2 ) gate through phase modulation of the stabilization drive. Finally, the lifetime in this architecture is examined as a function of the cat size of up to ten photons in the oscillator, achieving a bit-flip time higher than 1 ms and only a linear increase in the phase-flip rate, in good agreement with the theoretical analysis of the circuit. Our qubit shows promise as a building block for fault-tolerant quantum processors with a small footprint.

TI Investigating controlled teleportation capability of quantum states with
   respect to k-separability
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Quantum teleportation is an essential application of quantum entanglement. The examination of teleportation fidelity in two-party standard teleportation schemes reveals a critical threshold distinguishing separable and entangled states. For separable states, their teleportation fidelities cannot exceed the threshold, emphasizing the significance of entanglement. We extend this analysis to multiparty scenarios known as controlled teleportation. Our study provides thresholds that N -qudit k -separable states cannot exceed in a controlled teleportation scheme, where N ?, 3 and 2 k N . This not only establishes a standard for utilizing a given quantum state as a resource in controlled teleportation but also enhances our understanding of the influence of the entanglement structure on controlled teleportation performance. In addition, we show that genuine multipartite entanglement is not a prerequisite for achieving a high controlled teleportation capability.

AB Due to the no-cloning theorem, generating perfect quantum clones of an arbitrary unknown quantum state is not possible, however approximate quantum clones can be constructed. Quantum telecloning is a protocol that originates from a combination of quantum teleportation and quantum cloning. Here we present 1 -> 2 and 1 -> 3 quantum telecloning circuits, with and without ancilla, that are theoretically optimal (meaning the clones have the highest fidelity allowed by quantum mechanics), universal (meaning the clone fidelity is independent of the state being cloned), and symmetric (meaning the clones all have the same fidelity). We implement these circuits on gate model IBMQ and Quantinuum NISQ hardware and quantify the clone fidelities using parallel single qubit state tomography. Quantum telecloning using mid-circuit measurement with classical feedforward control (i.e. real time if statements) is demonstrated on the Quantinuum H1-2 device. Two alternative implementations of quantum telecloning, deferred measurement and post selection, are demonstrated on ibmq_montreal, where mid-circuit measurements with real time if statements are not available. Our results show that NISQ devices can achieve near-optimal quantum telecloning fidelity; for example the Quantinuum H1-2 device running the telecloning circuits without ancilla achieved a mean clone fidelity of 0.824 with standard deviation of 0.024 for two clone circuits and 0.765 with standard deviation of 0.022 for three clone circuits. The theoretical fidelity limits are 0.83 for two clones and 0.7 for three clones. This demonstrates the viability of performing experimental analysis of quantum information networks and quantum cryptography protocols on NISQ computers.

TI Optical pumping and relaxation of atomic population in assorted
   conditions
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICS B-ATOMIC MOLECULAR AND OPTICAL PHYSICS
AB Precise control and knowledge over atomic dynamics is central to the advancement of quantum technology. The different experimental conditions namely, atoms in a vacuum, antirelaxation coated and buffer gas filled atomic cells provide complementary platforms for such investigations. The extent of changes in optical pumping, velocity changing collision and hyperfine changing collision rates associated with these conditions are discussed. There is a phenomenal change in the optical density by a factor of >25 times in the presence of a control field in a buffer gas environment. We found confinement induced enhanced optical pumping as the mechanism behind the observed transparency in buffer gas cell. The diffusive velocity of atoms were measured to be similar to 25 +/- 12 m s(-1) and <= 8 +/- 4 m s(-1) for antirelaxation coated and buffer gas filled cells respectively. The measurements were carried out for Rb-85 atoms in natural isotopic composition using pump-probe spectroscopy. The studies will have useful application in measurements of relaxation rates, quantum memory, quantum repeaters and atomic devices.

TI NTRU-MCF: A Chaos-Enhanced Multidimensional Lattice Signature Scheme for
   Post-Quantum Cryptography
SO SENSORS
AB To address the growing threat of quantum computing to classical cryptographic primitives, this study introduces NTRU-MCF, a novel lattice-based signature scheme that integrates multidimensional lattice structures with fractional-order chaotic systems. By extending the NTRU framework to multidimensional polynomial rings, NTRU-MCF exponentially expands the private key search space, achieving a key space size >= 2256 for dimensions m >= 2 and rendering brute-force attacks infeasible. By incorporating fractional-order chaotic masks generated via a hyperchaotic L & uuml; system, the scheme introduces nonlinear randomness and robust resistance to physical attacks. Fractional-order chaotic masks, generated via a hyperchaotic L & uuml; system validated through NIST SP 800-22 randomness tests, replace conventional pseudorandom number generators (PRNGs). The sensitivity to initial conditions ensures cryptographic unpredictability, while the use of a fractional-order L hyperchaotic system-instead of conventional pseudorandom number generators (PRNGs)-leverages multiple Lyapunov exponents and initial value sensitivity to embed physically unclonable properties into key generation, effectively mitigating side-channel analysis. Theoretical analysis shows that NTRU-MCF's security reduces to the Ring Learning with Errors (RLWE) problem, offering superior quantum resistance compared to existing NTRU variants. While its computational and storage complexity suits high-security applications like military and financial systems, it is less suitable for resource-constrained devices. NTRU-MCF provides robust quantum resistance and side-channel defense, advancing PQC for classical computing environments.

TI Optical Spin Polarization of a Narrow-Linewidth Electron-Spin Qubit in a
   Chromophore/Stable-Radical System
SO ANGEWANDTE CHEMIE-INTERNATIONAL EDITION
AB Photoexcited organic chromophores appended to stable radicals can serve as qubit and/or qudit candidates for quantum information applications. 1,6,7,12-Tetra-(4-tert-butylphenoxy)-perylene-3,4 : 9,10-bis(dicarboximide) (tpPDI) linked to a partially deuterated alpha,gamma-bisdiphenylene-beta-phenylallyl radical (BDPA-d(16)) was synthesized and characterized by time-resolved optical and electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopies. Photoexcitation of tpPDI-BDPA-d(16) results in ultrafast radical-enhanced intersystem crossing to produce a quartet state (Q) followed by formation of a spin-polarized doublet ground state (D-0). Pulse-EPR experiments confirmed the spin multiplicity of Q and yielded coherence times of T-m=2.1 +/- 0.1 mu s and 2.8 +/- 0.2 mu s for Q and D-0, respectively. BDPA-d(16) eliminates the dominant H-1 hyperfine couplings, resulting in a single narrow line for both the Q and D-0 states, which enhances the spectral resolution needed for good qubit addressability.

TI Efficient Ancilla-Free Reversible and Quantum Circuits for the Hidden
   Weighted Bit Function
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON COMPUTERS
AB The Hidden Weighted Bit function plays an important role in the study of classical models of computation. A common belief is that this function is exponentially hard to implement using reversible ancilla-free circuits, even though introducing a small number of ancillae allows a very efficient implementation. In this paper, we refute the exponential hardness conjecture by developing a polynomial-size reversible ancilla-free circuit computing the Hidden Weighted Bit function. Our circuit has size O(n(6.42)) where n is the number of input bits. We also show that the Hidden Weighted Bit function can be computed by a quantum ancilla-free circuit of size O(n(2)). The technical tools employed come from a combination of Theoretical Computer Science (Barrington's theorem) and Physics (simulation of fermionic Hamiltonians) techniques.

TI Noise resilience in adaptive and symmetric monitored quantum circuits
SO NPJ QUANTUM INFORMATION
AB Monitored quantum circuits offer great perspectives for exploring the interplay of quantum information and complex quantum dynamics. These systems exhibit entanglement and purification phase transitions, along with various symmetry-enforced and ordered non-equilibrium phases. The central question is whether these phases can persist in real-world noisy devices. We study the fate of the symmetry-enforced absorbing state and charge-sharpening transitions in the presence of noise, and establish that noise results in coherent and incoherent symmetry-breaking effects. The coherent effects blur the distinction between phases, turning sharp transitions into crossovers, but states far from phase boundaries largely retain their essential character. We find, corrective feedback and postselected measurements can mitigate noise, stabilizing the absorbing and charge-sharp phases. Hence, if challenges like postselection are addressed, errors do not prevent the observation of symmetry-enforced phases in noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices. Additionally, we propose a symmetry-based method to characterize noise and gate fidelity.

TI Semi-quantum key distribution with two classical users
SO FRONTIERS IN PHYSICS
AB Semi-quantum key distribution (SQKD) is an important research issue which allows one quantum participant equipped with advanced quantum devices to distribute a shared secret key securely with one classical user who has restricted capabilities. In this paper, we propose a SQKD protocol which allows one quantum user to distribute two different private secret keys to two classical users respectively at the same time. Alice distributes two particle sequences from Bell states to Bob and Charlie respectively. Once the particles have been processed and returned, Alice can simultaneously detect reflected particles by Bob and Charlie based on Bell-state measurement and generate two different raw keys. To enable more participants in sharing keys, this protocol can be extended to the m + 1 party communication scheme by employing m-particle GHZ state. In large-scale communication networks, this extended model significantly reduces the complexity of communication compared to the traditional SQKD scheme. Security analyses show that the presented protocol is free from several general attacks, such as the entangle-measure attack, the modification attack, the double CNOT attack, and so on.

TI Computing secure key rates for quantum cryptography with untrusted
   devices
SO NPJ QUANTUM INFORMATION
AB Device-independent quantum key distribution (DIQKD) provides the strongest form of secure key exchange, using only the input-output statistics of the devices to achieve information-theoretic security. Although the basic security principles of DIQKD are now well understood, it remains a technical challenge to derive reliable and robust security bounds for advanced DIQKD protocols that go beyond the previous results based on violations of the CHSH inequality. In this work, we present a framework based on semidefinite programming that gives reliable lower bounds on the asymptotic secret key rate of any QKD protocol using untrusted devices. In particular, our method can in principle be utilized to find achievable secret key rates for any DIQKD protocol, based on the full input-output probability distribution or any choice of Bell inequality. Our method also extends to other DI cryptographic tasks.

   quantum key distribution
SO QUANTUM INFORMATION PROCESSING
AB A quantum conference key agreement (QCKA) protocol based on differential-phase-shift quantum key distribution is presented, which provides a common secret key for secure communication between more than two parties. In the proposed protocol, one party simultaneously broadcasts a weak coherent pulse train with {0, pi} phases to multiple parties that measure the phase differences between adjacent pulses using a delay interferometer followed by photon detectors, and the transmitter and receivers share secret key bits from the coincident counts in the receivers. The system setup and operation are simpler than those of conventional QCKA schemes that use a multipartite quantum entanglement state. The key creation performance is evaluated by considering the eavesdropping probability. The results indicate that the proposed scheme offers better performance than the conventional entanglement-based QCKA system.

TI Demonstrating quantum properties of triple photons generated by
   χ3 processes
SO EUROPEAN PHYSICAL JOURNAL D
AB Triple-photon generation (TPG) is based on a third-order nonlinear optical interaction, which is the most direct way to produce pure quantum three-photon states. These states can exhibit three-body quantum correlations, and their statistics cannot be reproduced by any Gaussian statistics of coherent sources or optical parametric twin-photon generator, making them potentially useful for quantum information processing tasks such as quantum state distillation, quantum error-correction and universal quantum computing. Furthermore, the generation of entangled photon pairs heralded by the detection of a third photon can be used in advanced quantum communication protocols. We made the first experimental demonstration of TPG in 2004 using a bi-stimulation scheme in a bulk KTP crystal, followed by the quantum theory. The new challenges are now to achieve a spontaneous TPG and the corresponding quantum experiments and protocols using oriented ridge KTP waveguides, which ensures both birefringence phase-matching and light confinement. The waveguides are cut by a precision dicing saw. We recently performed their characterization using third-harmonic generation measurements, which showed their good quality. A rate of about 5 triplets per second is expected when pumping a 5-cm-long waveguide with a 5-W 532 nm beam in the CW regime. Such a spontaneous TPG exhibits low rate of triple photons, which makes the certification of quantum features hard. In this article, we review our theoretical and experimental work on TPG and the associated quantum modeling. We also develop theoretical tools for the certification of quantum features of spontaneous triple-photon states.

TI Quantum entanglement and axion physics

AB The axion particle is the outcome of the proposed Peccei-Quinn mechanism for solving the strong CP problem. Axion is also a popular dark matter candidate. Thus, there is an increased interest in establishing its existence. Axions couple to two photons and most experiments search for the transition of an axion into a photon, in the presence of a magnetic field. In our study, we examine the coupling of the axion into a pair of entangled photons. The presence of a magnetic field changes the polarization correlations of the entangled photons, thus offering an unambiguous signature for axion existence.

TI Quantum-Classical Simulation of Quantum Field Theory by Quantum Circuit
   Learning
SO ANNALEN DER PHYSIK
AB Quantum circuit learning is employed to simulate quantum field theories (QFTs). Typically, when simulating QFTs with quantum computers, significant challenges are encountered due to the technical limitations of quantum devices when implementing the Hamiltonian using Pauli spin matrices. To address this challenge, quantum circuit learning is leveraged, employing a compact configuration of qubits and low-depth quantum circuits to predict real-time dynamics in quantum field theories. The key advantage of this approach is that a single-qubit measurement can accurately forecast various physical parameters, including fully-connected operators. To demonstrate the effectiveness of this method, it is used to predict quench dynamics, chiral dynamics and jet production in a 1+1-dimensional model of quantum electrodynamics. It is found that our predictions closely align with the results of rigorous classical calculations, exhibiting a high degree of accuracy. This hybrid quantum-classical approach illustrates the feasibility of efficiently simulating large-scale QFTs on cutting-edge quantum devices.

The feasibility of transmitting qubits through the free-space channel with the aid of moving platforms like satellites, aircraft, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) has been verified. In view of the limited working time and resource consumption of the satellite-based QKD and the last-mile challenges of connecting satellite nodes with terrestrial networks, the airborne QKD is expected to provide flexible and relay links for the large-scale integrated network. This paper reviews the recent significant progress of QKD based on aircraft or UAVs, highlights their critical techniques, and prospects the future of airborne quantum communications.

TI Measurement-Induced Transition in Long-Range Interacting Quantum
   Circuits
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB The competition between scrambling unitary evolution and projective measurements leads to a phase transition in the dynamics of quantum entanglement. Here, we demonstrate that the nature of this transition is fundamentally altered by the presence of long-range, power-law interactions. For sufficiently weak power laws, the measurement-induced transition is described by conformal field theory, analogous to short-range-interacting hybrid circuits. However, beyond a critical power law, we demonstrate that long-range interactions give rise to a continuum of nonconformal universality classes, with continuously varying critical exponents. We numerically determine the phase diagram for a one-dimensional, long-range-interacting hybrid circuit model as a function of the power-law exponent and the measurement rate. Finally, by using an analytic mapping to a long-range quantum Ising model, we provide a theoretical understanding for the critical power law.

TI Pseudo-Qutrit Formed by Two Interacting Identical Spins (s=1/2) in a
   Variable External Magnetic Field
SO ENTROPY
AB An analytical solution is obtained for the problem of two interacting, identical but separated spin 1/2 particles in a time-dependent external magnetic field, in a general case. The solution involves isolating the pseudo-qutrit subsystem from a two-qubit system. It is shown that the quantum dynamics of a pseudo-qutrit system with a magnetic dipole-dipole interaction can be described clearly and accurately in an adiabatic representation, using a time-dependent basis set. The transition probabilities between the energy levels for an adiabatically varying magnetic field, which follows the Landau-Majorana-Stuckelberg-Zener (LMSZ) model within a short time interval, are illustrated in the appropriate graphs. It is shown that for close energy levels and entangled states, the transition probabilities are not small and strongly depend on the time. These results provide insight into the degree of entanglement of two spins (qubits) over time. Furthermore, the results are applicable to more complex systems with a time-dependent Hamiltonian.

TI Estimating the Photon-Number Distribution of Photonic Channels for
   Realistic Devices and Applications in Photonic Quantum Information
   Processing
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW APPLIED
AB Characterizing the input-output photon-number distribution of an unknown optical quantum channel is a worthwhile task for many applications in quantum information processing. Ideally, this would require deterministic photon-number sources and photon-number-resolving detectors, but these technologies are still work in progress. In this work, we propose a general method to rigorously bound the input-output photon-number distribution of an unknown optical channel using standard optical devices such as coherent light sources and non-photon-number-resolving detectors and homodyne detectors. To demonstrate the broad utility of our method, we consider the security analysis of practical quantum key distribution systems based on calibrated single-photon detectors and an experimental proposal to implement time-correlated single-photon counting technology using homodyne detectors instead of single-photon detectors.

CY APR 02-06, 2022

SP ACM SIGPLAN, Assoc Comp Machinery
AB Quantum computing hardware has progressed rapidly. Simultaneously, there has been a proliferation of programming languages and program optimization tools for quantum computing. Existing quantum compilers use intermediate representations (IRs) where quantum programs are described as circuits. Such IRs fail to leverage existing work on compiler optimizations. In such IRs, it is non-trivial to statically check for physical constraints such as the no-cloning theorem, which states that qubits cannot be copied. We introduce QSSA, a novel quantum IR based on static single assignment (SSA) that enables decades of research in compiler optimizations to be applied to quantum compilation. QSSA models quantum operations as being side-effect-free. The inputs and outputs of the operation are in one-to-one correspondence; qubits cannot be created or destroyed. As a result, our IR supports a static analysis pass that verifies no-cloning at compile-time. The quantum circuit is fully encoded within the def-use chain of the IR, allowing us to leverage existing optimization passes on SSA representations such as redundancy elimination and dead-code elimination. Running our QSSA-based compiler on the QASMBench and IBM Quantum Challenge datasets, we show that our optimizations perform comparably to IBM's Qiskit quantum compiler infrastructure. QSSA allows us to represent, analyze, and transform quantum programs using the robust theory of SSA representations, bringing quantum compilation into the realm of well-understood theory and practice.

TI Experimental Implementation of Enhanced Security Coherent One-Way
   Quantum Key Distribution
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB Coherent One-Way (COW) is a simple and widely utilized quantum key distribution (QKD) protocol, favored in both experimental and commercial applications. In this paper, we compare the information that an eavesdropper, Eve, can acquire in both the 2-decoy and 1-decoy COW protocols. Our findings demonstrate that the 2-decoy protocol offers enhanced security compared to the original 1-decoy COW, all while preserving the simplicity of implementation. Furthermore, we have experimentally implemented the improved security COW-QKD (2-decoy protocol), achieving a secure key rate exceeding 0.5 kbps over a distance of 110 km (22 dB loss) in optical fiber, with an interference visibility greater than 80%. We also emphasize that monitoring the click rates of the data line detector for each state individually serves as a powerful method for detecting zero-error attacks.

TI Fidelity decay and error accumulation in random quantum circuits
SO SCIPOST PHYSICS
AB Fidelity decay captures the inevitable state degradation in any practical implementation of a quantum process. We devise bounds for the decay of fidelity for a generic evolution given by a random quantum circuit model that encompasses errors arising from the implementation of two-qubit gates and qubit permutations. We show that fidelity decays exponentially with both circuit depth and the number of qubits raised to an architecturedependent power and we determine the decay rates as a function of the amplitude of the aforementioned errors. Furthermore, we demonstrate the utility of our results in benchmarking quantum processors using the quantum volume figure of merit and provide insights into strategies for improving processor performance. These findings pave the way for understanding how states evolving under generic quantum dynamics degrade due to the accumulation of different kinds of perturbations.

TI Topology identification of autonomous quantum dynamical networks
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Topology identification comprises reconstructing the Hamiltonian, and thus the corresponding interaction terms, by properly processing measurements of its density operator within a fixed time interval. It finds application in several quantum technology contexts, ranging from quantum communication to quantum computing or sensing. In this paper we provide analytical conditions for the solvability of the topology identification problem for autonomous quantum dynamical networks (i.e., as in our case, not explicitly depending on time via the use of an external drive). The solvability condition is then converted in an algorithm for quantum network reconstruction that is easily implementable on standard computer facilities. The obtained algorithm is tested for Hamiltonian reconstruction on numerical examples based on the quantum walks formalism.

TI Quantum algorithms for powering stable Hermitian matrices
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Matrix powering is a fundamental computational primitive in linear algebra. It has widespread applications in scientific computing and engineering and underlies the solution of time-homogeneous linear ordinary differential equations, simulation of discrete-time Markov chains, or discovering the spectral properties of matrices with iterative methods. In this paper, we investigate the possibility of speeding up matrix powering of sparse stable Hermitian matrices on a quantum computer. We present two quantum algorithms that can achieve speedup over the classical matrix powering algorithms: (i) a fast-forwarding algorithm that builds on construction of Apers and Sarlette [Quantum Inf. Comput. 19, 181 (2019)] and (ii) an algorithm based on Hamiltonian simulation. Furthermore, by mapping the N-bit parity determination problem to a matrix powering problem, we provide no-go theorems that limit the quantum speedups achievable in powering non-Hermitian matrices.

TI Translating the Nearest Convex Hull Classifier from Classical to Quantum
   Computing
SO QUANTUM REPORTS
AB The nearest convex hull (NCH) classifier is a promising algorithm for the classification of biosignals, such as electroencephalography (EEG) signals, especially when adapted to the classification of symmetric positive definite matrices. In this paper, we implemented a version of this classifier that can execute either on a traditional computer or a quantum simulator, and we tested it against state-of-the-art classifiers for EEG classification. This article addresses the practical challenges of adapting a classical algorithm to one that can be executed on a quantum computer or a quantum simulator. One of these challenges is to find a formulation of the classification problem that is quadratic, is binary, and accepts only linear constraints-that is, an objective function that can be solved using a variational quantum algorithm. In this article, we present two approaches to solve this problem, both compatible with continuous variables. Finally, we evaluated, for the first time, the performance of the NCH classifier on real EEG data using both quantum and classical optimization methods. We selected a particularly challenging dataset, where classical optimization typically performs poorly, and demonstrated that the nearest convex hull classifier was able to generalize with a modest performance. One lesson from this case study is that, by separating the objective function from the solver, it becomes possible to allow an existing classical algorithm to run on a quantum computer, as long as an appropriate objective function-quadratic and binary-can be found.

The performance of the compensated feedback loop is theoretically analyzed and simulated. Radio frequency generators and mixer emulate the lasers and interference plus photon counting processes to perform closed-loop verification without lasers. When the sum of the linewidths of the two emulated lasers is 1.175 kHz, the interference root-mean-square phase noise is suppressed from 1626 degrees to 30 degrees. A closed-loop phase noise of approximately 13 degrees is expected for field experiments with the same laser linewidth and 8 mu s loop delay.

TI Hybrid Quantum Genetic Algorithm with Fuzzy Adaptive Rotation Angle for
   Efficient Placement of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles in Natural Disaster
   Areas
SO AXIOMS
AB A Hybrid Quantum Genetic Algorithm with Fuzzy Adaptive Rotation Angle (HQGAFARA) is introduced in this work to determine the optimal placements for Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) aimed at maximizing coverage in disaster-stricken areas. The HQGAFARA is a hybrid quantum fuzzy meta-heuristic that uses the Deutsch-Jozsa quantum circuit to generate quantum populations synergistically working as haploid recombination and mutation operators that take advantage of quantum entanglement, providing exploitative and explorative features to produce new individuals. In place of the conventional lookup table or mathematical equation, we introduced a fuzzy heuristic to adapt the rotation angle employed in quantum gates. The hybrid nature of this algorithm becomes evident through its utilization of both classical and quantum computing components. Experimental evaluations were conducted using two distinct test sets. The first set, termed the "best case", represents conditions that are the most favorable for determining the UAV positions, while the second set, the "worst-case", simulates highly challenging conditions for locating the UAV positions, thereby posing a significant test for the proposed algorithm. We carried out statistical comparative analyses, assessing the HQGAFARA against other hybrid quantum algorithms that employ different rotation angles and against the classical genetic algorithm. The experimental results demonstrated that the HQGAFARA performed comparably, if not better, to the classical genetic algorithm regarding precision. Furthermore, quantum algorithms showcased their computational prowess in experiments related to the convergence time.

TI A real-world test of portfolio optimization with quantum annealing
SO QUANTUM MACHINE INTELLIGENCE
AB In this note, we describe an experiment on portfolio optimization using the Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) formulation. The dataset we use is taken from a real-world problem for which a classical solution is currently deployed and used in production. In this work, carried out in a collaboration between the Raiffeisen Bank International (RBI) and Reply, we derive a QUBO formulation, which we solve using various methods: two D-Wave hybrid solvers, that combine the employment of a quantum annealer together with classical methods, and a purely classical algorithm. Particular focus is given to the implementation of the constraint that requires the resulting portfolio's variance to be below a specified threshold, whose representation in an Ising model is not straightforward. We find satisfactory results, consistent with the global optimum obtained by the exact classical strategy. However, since the tuning of QUBO parameters is crucial for the optimization, we investigate a hybrid method that allows for automatic tuning.

TI Consistency of Quantum Computation and the Equivalence Principle
SO FOUNDATIONS OF SCIENCE
AB The equivalence principle, being one of the building blocks of general relativity, seems to be crucial for analysis of quantum effects in gravity. In this paper we consider the relation between the equivalence principle and the consistency of quantum information processing in gravitational field. We propose an analysis with a looped evolution consisting of steps both in the gravitational field and in the accelerated reference frame. We show that without the equivalence principle the looped quantum evolution cannot be unitary and looses its consistency. For this reasoning the equivalence principle is formulated in terms of the gauge transformations and is analyzed for particles acquiring an appropriate phase associated with the action over the looped path. In consequence, to keep consistency of quantum operations in gravitational field, it is required to keep a quantum variant of the equivalence principle. This proves importance of the quantized version of this fundamental gravitational principle for quantum information processing.

TI Quantum machine learning for chemistry and physics
SO CHEMICAL SOCIETY REVIEWS
AB Machine learning (ML) has emerged as a formidable force for identifying hidden but pertinent patterns within a given data set with the objective of subsequent generation of automated predictive behavior. In recent years, it is safe to conclude that ML and its close cousin, deep learning (DL), have ushered in unprecedented developments in all areas of physical sciences, especially chemistry. Not only classical variants of ML, even those trainable on near-term quantum hardwares have been developed with promising outcomes. Such algorithms have revolutionized materials design and performance of photovoltaics, electronic structure calculations of ground and excited states of correlated matter, computation of force-fields and potential energy surfaces informing chemical reaction dynamics, reactivity inspired rational strategies of drug designing and even classification of phases of matter with accurate identification of emergent criticality. In this review we shall explicate a subset of such topics and delineate the contributions made by both classical and quantum computing enhanced machine learning algorithms over the past few years. We shall not only present a brief overview of the well-known techniques but also highlight their learning strategies using statistical physical insight. The objective of the review is not only to foster exposition of the aforesaid techniques but also to empower and promote cross-pollination among future research in all areas of chemistry which can benefit from ML and in turn can potentially accelerate the growth of such algorithms.

In this work, we leverage fiber-coupled devices, which encompass fibered photon pair-sources and off-the-shelf optics, to demonstrate Hong-Ou-Mandel interference. We employ two distinct single photon sources, namely a heralded single-photon source and a weak coherent laser source, both operating asynchronously in continuous-wave regime. We record two-photon coincidences, showing a state-of-art visibility of 91.9(5)%.

A novel feature for the heterotic string is that the gauge symmetry must be broken by a Wilson line to ensure modular invariance. We completely classify the patterns of symmetry breaking. We show that the tachyonic contributions in all cases can be analytically continued, with a finite answer in the domain 0 < N <= 1, relevant for calculating entanglement entropy across the Rindler horizon.

TI Tunable single-photon emitters in 2D materials
SO NANOPHOTONICS
AB Single-photon emitters (SPEs) hold the key to many quantum technologies including quantum computing. In particular, developing a scalable array of identical SPEs can play an important role in preparing single photons - crucial resources for computation - at a high rate, allowing to improve the computational capacity. Recently, different types of SPEs have been found in various 2D materials. Towards realizing scalable SPE arrays in 2D materials for quantum computation, it is required to develop tunable SPEs that can produce identical photons by precisely controlling emission properties. Here, we present a brief review of the recent progress on various tuning methods in different 2D materials. Firstly, we discuss the operation principle of different 2D SPEs along with their unique characteristics. Secondly, we introduce various dynamic strain engineering methods for tuning the emission wavelengths in 2D SPEs. We also present several electric field-induced wavelength tuning methods for 2D SPEs. Lastly, we discuss the outlook of dynamically tunable 2D SPEs towards scalable 2D SPE arrays for realizing practical quantum photonics applications.

TI Characterization of a quantum bus between two driven qubits
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB We investigate the use of driven qubits coupled to a harmonic oscillator to implement a root iSWAP gate. By dressing the qubits through an external driving field, the qubits and the harmonic oscillator can be selectively coupled, allowing for the measurement of individual qubit states, as well as leading to effective qubit-qubit interactions. We compare the qubit readout on bare and dressed qubits, and demonstrate that when coupled to low-frequency resonators, dressed qubits provide a more robust readout than bare qubits in the presence of damping and thermal effects. Furthermore, we study the impact of various system parameters on the fidelity of the two-qubit gate, identifying an optimal range for quantum computation. Our findings guide the implementation of high-fidelity quantum gates in experimental setups, for example, those employing nanoscale mechanical resonators.

TI A feasible path for the use of ferromagnetic josephson junctions in
   quantum circuits: The ferro-transmon
SO LOW TEMPERATURE PHYSICS
AB We discuss the capabilities of ferromagnetic (F) Josephson junctions (JJs) in a variety of layouts and configurations. The main goal is to demonstrate the potential of these hybrid JJs to disclose new physics and the possibility to integrate them in superconducting classical and quantum electronics for various applications. The feasible path towards the use of ferromagnetic Josephson junctions in quantum circuits starts from experiments demonstrating macroscopic quantum tunneling in NbN/GdN/NbN junctions with ferro-insulator barriers and with triplet components of the supercurrent, supported by a self-consistent electrodynamic characterization as a function of the barrier thickness. This has inspired further studies on tunnel ferromagnetic junctions with a different layout and promoted the first generation of ferromagnetic Al-based JJs, specifically Al/AlOx/Al/Py/Al. This layout takes advantage of the capability to integrate the ferromagnetic layer in the junction without affecting the quality of the superconducting electrodes and of the tunnel barrier. The high quality of the devices paves the way for the possible implementation of Al tunnel-ferromagnetic JJs in superconducting quantum circuits. These achievements have promoted the notion of a novel type of qubit incorporating ferromagnetic JJs. This qubit is based on a transmon design featuring a tunnel JJ in parallel with a ferromagnetic JJ inside a SQUID loop capacitively coupled to a superconducting readout resonator. The effect of an external RF field on the magnetic switching processes of ferromagnetic JJs has been also investigated.

TI Characterization of isotropic laser cooling for application in quantum
   sensing
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB Y Quantum sensing with cold atoms is attracting more and more attention in the research frontier of quantum technologies. Isotropic laser cooling serves as a promising platform for this area and its many advantages include compactness, robustness, and not requiring fine-tuning of the optical alignment or magnetic field, which are particularly suitable for field and space applications. We have designed and demonstrated a special form of isotropic laser cooling system that is specifically tailored for the purpose of quantum sensing. In particular, the diffused cooling optical field is generated by hollow laser beam injection and the quality of detection process is improved. Moreover, the effective strength of diffused cooling laser is quantitatively deduced. We have carefully characterized the properties of our system, including the laser cooling performances with respect to different parameter settings, the influences of cooling laser polarization and repumping laser power, and radial atom density distribution. We anticipate that our progress will contribute to the future development of isotropic laser cooling for quantum sensing and quantum precision measurements.

TI Direct manipulation of a superconducting spin qubit strongly coupled to
   a transmon qubit
SO NATURE PHYSICS
AB Spin qubits in semiconductors are a promising platform for producing highly scalable quantum computing devices. However, it is difficult to realize multiqubit interactions over extended distances. Superconducting spin qubits provide an alternative by encoding a qubit in the spin degree of freedom of an Andreev level. These Andreev spin qubits have an intrinsic spin-supercurrent coupling that enables the use of recent advances in circuit quantum electrodynamics. The first realization of an Andreev spin qubit encoded the qubit in the excited states of a semiconducting weak link, leading to frequent decay out of the computational subspace. Additionally, rapid qubit manipulation was hindered by the need for indirect Raman transitions. Here we use an electrostatically defined quantum dot Josephson junction with large charging energy, which leads to a spin-split doublet ground state. We tune the qubit frequency over a frequency range of 10 GHz using a magnetic field, which also enables us to investigate the qubit performance using direct spin manipulation. An all-electric microwave drive produces Rabi frequencies exceeding 200 MHz. We embed the Andreev spin qubit in a superconducting transmon qubit, demonstrating strong coherent qubit-qubit coupling. These results are a crucial step towards a hybrid architecture that combines the beneficial aspects of both superconducting and semiconductor qubits.
   Semiconductor qubits can benefit from existing industrial methods, but there are challenges in coupling qubits together. A hybrid superconductor-semiconductor qubit that couples to superconducting qubit devices may overcome these issues.

TI Strong Coupling Optomechanics Mediated by a Qubit in the Dispersive
   Regime
SO ENTROPY
AB Cavity optomechanics represents a flexible platform for the implementation of quantum technologies, useful in particular for the realization of quantum interfaces, quantum sensors and quantum information processing. However, the dispersive, radiation-pressure interaction between the mechanical and the electromagnetic modes is typically very weak, harnessing up to now the demonstration of interesting nonlinear dynamics and quantum control at the single photon level. It has already been shown both theoretically and experimentally that if the interaction is mediated by a Josephson circuit, one can have an effective dynamics corresponding to a huge enhancement of the single-photon optomechanical coupling. Here we analyze in detail this phenomenon in the general case when the cavity mode and the mechanical mode interact via an off-resonant qubit. Using a Schrieffer-Wolff approximation treatment, we determine the regime where this tripartite hybrid system behaves as an effective cavity optomechanical system in the strong coupling regime.

TI RSFQ All-Digital Programmable Multitone Generator for Quantum
   Applications
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON QUANTUM ENGINEERING
AB One of the most important and topical challenges of quantum circuits is their scalability. Rapid single flux quantum (RSFQ) technology is at the forefront of replacing current standard CMOS-based control architectures for a number of applications, including quantum computing and quantum sensor arrays. By condensing the control and readout to single-flux-quantum-based on-chip devices that are directly connected to the quantum systems, it is possible to minimize the total system overhead, improving scalability and integration. In this article, we present a novel RSFQ device that generates multitone digital signals, based on complex pulse train sequences using a circular shift register (CSR) and a comb filter stage. We show that the frequency spectrum of the pulse trains is dependent on a preloaded pattern on the CSR, as well as on the delay line of the comb filter stage. By carefully selecting both the pattern and delay, the desired tones can be isolated and amplified as required. Finally, we propose architectures where this device can be implemented to control and read out arrays of quantum devices, such as qubits and single-photon detectors.

TI Quantum Algorithms for Escaping from Saddle Points
SO QUANTUM
AB We initiate the study of quantum algorithms for escaping from saddle points with provable guarantee. Given a function f : R-n -> R, our quantum algorithm outputs an epsilon-approximate second-order stationary point using (O) over tilde (log(2) (n)/epsilon(1.75))(1) queries to the quantum evaluation oracle (i.e., the zeroth-order oracle). Compared to the classical state-of-the-art algorithm by Jin et al. with (O) over tilde (log(6) (n)/epsilon(1.75)) queries to the gradient oracle (i.e., the first-order oracle), our quantum algorithm is polynomially better in terms of log n and matches its complexity in terms of 1/epsilon. Technically, our main contribution is the idea of replacing the classical perturbations in gradient descent methods by simulating quantum wave equations, which constitutes the improvement in the quantum query complexity with log n factors for escaping from saddle points. We also show how to use a quantum gradient computation algorithm due to Jordan to replace the classical gradient queries by quantum evaluation queries with the same complexity. Finally, we also perform numerical experiments that support our theoretical findings.

TI Reshaping quantum device noise via repetition code circuits
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Noise of a quantum processor can be an important resource for simulating open quantum dynamics. However, this requires characterizing the device noise and then transforming it into a target structure. Here, we take the first step toward this goal: We analytically and numerically study reshaping the noise associated with native trapped-ion two-qubit entangling gates via quantum circuits based on repetition codes, and demonstrate our findings on the IonQ Aria-1 quantum hardware. We investigate all the building blocks, including the quantum channels describing noisy two-qubit entangling gates, the compilation of the encoding circuits into native gates, and the propagation of two-qubit errors across ideal single-qubit gates.

SO QUANTUM MACHINE INTELLIGENCE
AB Quantum computing is a transformative technology with the potential to enhance operations in the space industry through the acceleration of optimization and machine learning processes. Machine learning processes enable automated image classification in geospatial data. Quantum algorithms provide novel approaches for solving these problems and a potential future advantage over current classical techniques. Universal Quantum Computers, developed by Rigetti Computing and other providers, enable fully general quantum algorithms to be executed, with theoretically proven speed-up over classical algorithms in certain cases. This paper describes an approach to satellite image classification using a universal quantum enhancement to convolutional neural networks: the quanvolutional neural network. Using a refined method, we found a performance improvement over previous quantum efforts in this domain and identified potential refinements that could lead to an eventual quantum advantage. We benchmark these networks using the SAT-4 satellite imagery dataset in order to demonstrate the utility of machine learning techniques in the space industry and the potential benefits that quantum machine learning can offer.

When restricted to the diagonals of the density matrix, these quantum models reduce to integrable classical cellular automata.

In this research, the security of the most famous protocol of quantum key distribution (BB84) has been studied by considering the characteristics of a single-photon source. This paper derives the impact of propagation on photon statistics. The result reveals that the propagation leads to a change in its value, especially in long distances. Besides, the parameter deviation from an ideal source causes a decrease in the confident length. We achieved a difference of up to 1800 km for the safe distance by studying the relation for minimum transmission coefficient in available single-photon sources.

TI Diabetes Type 2: Poincare Data Preprocessing for Quantum Machine
   Learning
SO CMC-COMPUTERS MATERIALS & CONTINUA
AB Quantum Machine Learning (QML) techniques have been recently attracting massive interest. However reported applications usually employ synthetic or well-known datasets. One of these techniques based on using a hybrid approach combining quantum and classic devices is the Variational Quantum Classifier (VQC), which development seems promising. Albeit being largely studied, VQC implementations for "real-world" datasets are still challenging on Noisy Intermediate Scale Quantum devices (NISQ). In this paper we propose a preprocessing pipeline based on Stokes parameters for data mapping. This pipeline enhances the prediction rates when applying VQC techniques, improving the feasibility of solving classification problems using NISQ devices. By including feature selection techniques and geometrical transformations, enhanced quantum state preparation is achieved. Also, a representation based on the Stokes parameters in the Poincare Sphere is possible for visualizing the data. Our results show that by using the proposed techniques we improve the classification score for the incidence of acute comorbid diseases in Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus patients. We used the implemented version of VQC available on IBM's framework Qiskit, and obtained with two and three qubits an accuracy of 70% and 72% respectively.

TI Entangled state generation via quantum walks with multiple coins
SO NPJ QUANTUM INFORMATION
AB Generation of entangled state is of paramount importance both from quantum theoretical foundation and technology applications. Entanglement swapping provides an efficient method to generate entanglement in quantum communication protocols. However, perfect Bell measurements for qudits, the key to entanglement swapping, have been proven impossible to achieve by using only linear elements and particle detectors. To avoid this bottleneck, we propose a scheme to generate entangled state including two-qubit entangled state, two-qudit entangled state, three-qubit GHZ state and three-qudit GHZ state between several designate parties via the model of quantum walks with multiple coins. Then we conduct experimental realization of Bell state and three-qubit GHZ state between several designate parties on IBM quantum platform and the result has high fidelity by performing quantum tomography. In the end, we give a practical application of our scheme in multiparty quantum secret sharing.

TI Nonlinear-response theory for lossy superconducting quantum circuits
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB We introduce a numerically exact and computationally feasible nonlinear-response theory developed for lossy superconducting quantum circuits based on a framework of quantum dissipation in a minimally extended state space. Starting from the Feynman-Vernon path-integral formalism for open quantum systems with the system degrees of freedom being the nonlinear elements of the circuit, we eliminate the temporally nonlocal influence functional of all linear elements by introducing auxiliary harmonic modes with complex-valued frequencies coupled to the nonlinear elements. In our work, we propose a concept of time-averaged observables, inspired by experiment, and provide an explicit formula for producing their quasiprobability distribution. We illustrate the consistency of our formalism with the well-established Markovian input-output theory by applying them the dispersive readout of a superconducting transmon qubit. For an important demonstration of our approach beyond weak coupling, we analyze the low-frequency linear response of a capacitively and resistively shunted Josephson junction and observe signatures of a much-debated quantum phase transition at a finite temperature. The developed framework enables a comprehensive fully quantum-mechanical treatment of nonlinear quantum circuits coupled to their environment, without the limitations of typical approaches to weak dissipation, high temperature, and weak drive. This versatile tool paves the way for accurate models of quantum devices and increased fundamental understanding of quanutm mechanics such as that of the quantum measurement.

TI Polynomial time classical versus quantum algorithms for representation
   theoretic multiplicities
SO COMPUTATIONAL COMPLEXITY
AB Littlewood-Richardson, Kronecker and plethysm coefficients are fundamental multiplicities of interest in Representation Theory and Algebraic Combinatorics. Determining a combinatorial interpretation for the Kronecker and plethysm coefficients is a major open problem and prompts the consideration of their computational complexity. Recently, it was shown that they behave relatively well with respect to quantum computation, and for some large families there are polynomial-time quantum algorithms (Larocca and Havlicek in Quantum algorithms for representation-theoretic multiplicities, 2024. arXiv:2407.17649) (also Bravyi et al. in PRX Quantum 5(1):010329, 2024). In this paper, we show that for many of those cases the Kronecker and plethysm coefficients can also be computed in polynomial time via classical algorithms, thereby refuting some of the conjectures in Larocca and Havlicek (2024). This vastly limits the cases in which the desired superpolynomial quantum speedup could be achieved.

However, the optimal control of such systems remains notoriously challenging, limiting the potential of large-scale quantum systems. Here, we investigate a model problem of quantum state transfer in a large nearest-neighbor-coupled qubit array. We derive an optimal control strategy that simultaneously achieves maximal fidelity and minimal transfer time, reaching the quantum speed limit in a lattice with time-varying couplings.

TI Taking advantage of noise in quantum reservoir computing
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB The biggest challenge that quantum computing and quantum machine learning are currently facing is the presence of noise in quantum devices. As a result, big efforts have been put into correcting or mitigating the induced errors. But, can these two fields benefit from noise? Surprisingly, we demonstrate that under some circumstances, quantum noise can be used to improve the performance of quantum reservoir computing, a prominent and recent quantum machine learning algorithm. Our results show that the amplitude damping noise can be beneficial to machine learning, while the depolarizing and phase damping noises should be prioritized for correction. This critical result sheds new light into the physical mechanisms underlying quantum devices, providing solid practical prescriptions for a successful implementation of quantum information processing in nowadays hardware.

TI Subsystem Codes with High Thresholds by Gauge Fixing and Reduced Qubit
   Overhead
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW X
AB We introduce a technique that uses gauge fixing to significantly improve the quantum-error-correcting performance of subsystem codes. By changing the order in which check operators are measured, valuable additional information can be gained, and we introduce a new method for decoding which uses this information to improve performance. Applied to the subsystem toric code with three-qubit check operators, we increase the threshold under circuit-level depolarizing noise from 0.67% to 0.81%. The threshold increases further under a circuit-level noise model with small finite bias, up to 2.22% for infinite bias. Furthermore, we construct families of finite-rate subsystem low-density parity-check codes with three-qubit check operators and optimal-depth parity-check measurement schedules. To the best of our knowledge, these finite-rate subsystem codes outperform all known codes at circuit-level depolarizing error rates as high as 0.2%, where they have a qubit overhead that is 4.3x lower than the most efficient version of the surface code and 5.1x lower than the subsystem toric code. Their threshold and pseudo-threshold exceeds 0.42% for circuit-level depolarizing noise, increasing to 2.4% under infinite bias using gauge fixing.

TI Transformer-based quantum error decoding enhanced by QGANs: towards
   scalable surface code correction algorithms
SO EPJ QUANTUM TECHNOLOGY
AB To address qubits' high environmental sensitivity and reduce the significant error rates in current quantum devices, quantum error correction stands as one of the most dependable approaches. The topological surface code, renowned for its unique qubit lattice structure, is widely considered a pivotal tool for enabling fault-tolerant quantum computation. Through redundancy introduced across multiple qubits, the surface code safeguards quantum information and identifies errors via state changes captured by syndrome qubits. However, simultaneous errors in data and syndrome qubits substantially escalate decoding complexity. Quantum Generative Adversarial Networks (QGANs) have emerged as promising deep learning frameworks, effectively harnessing quantum advantages for practical tasks such as image processing and data optimization. Consequently, a topological code trainer for quantum-classical hybrid GANs is proposed as an auxiliary model to enhance error correction in machine learning-based decoders, demonstrating significantly improved training accuracy compared to the traditional Minimum Weight Perfect Matching (MWPM) algorithm, which achieves an accuracy of 65%. Numerical experiments reveal that the decoder achieves a fidelity threshold of P = 0.1978, substantially surpassing the traditional algorithm's threshold of P = 0.1024. To enhance decoding efficiency, a Transformer decoder is integrated, incorporating syndrome error outputs trained via QGANs into its framework. By leveraging its self-attention mechanism, the Transformer effectively captures long-range qubit dependencies at a global scale, enabling high-fidelity error correction over larger dimensions. Numerical validation of the surface code error threshold demonstrates an 8.5% threshold with a correction success rate exceeding 94%, whereas the local MWPM decoder achieves only 55% and fails to support large-scale computation at a 4% threshold.

TI Progress in Trapped-Ion Quantum Simulation
SO ANNUAL REVIEW OF CONDENSED MATTER PHYSICS
AB Trapped ions offer long coherence times and high-fidelity, programmable quantum operations, making them a promising platform for quantum simulation of condensed matter systems, quantum dynamics, and problems related to high-energy physics. We review selected developments in trappedion qubits and architectures and discuss quantum simulation applications that utilize these emerging capabilities. This review emphasizes developments in digital (gate-based) quantum simulations that exploit trapped-ion hardware capabilities, such as flexible qubit connectivity, selective midcircuit measurement, and classical feedback, to simulate models with long-range interactions, explore nonunitary dynamics, compress simulations of states with limited entanglement, and reduce the circuit depths required to prepare or simulate long-range entangled states.

TI Performance optimization of continuous-variable quantum teleportation
   with generalized photon-varying non-Gaussian operations
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Continuous variable quantum teleportation provides a path to the long-distance transmission of quantum states. Photon-varying non-Gaussian operations have been shown to improve the fidelity of quantum teleportation when integrated into the protocol. However, for a given type of non-Gaussian operation, the achievable fidelity varies with the parameters associated with the operation. Previous work only focused on particular settings of the parameters, over which an optimization was missing. The potential of such operations is not fully uncovered. Given a fixed non-Gaussian operation, the achievable fidelity also varies with input states. An operation that increases the fidelity for teleporting one class of states might do the contrary for other classes of states. A performance metric, upon which an operation is optimized, suitable for different input states, is also missing. In this work, we build a framework for photon-varying non-Gaussian operations for multimode states, upon which we propose a performance metric suitable for arbitrary teleportation input states. We then apply the new metric to evaluate different types of non-Gaussian operations. Starting from simple multiphoton photon subtraction and photon addition, we find that increasing the number of ancillary photons involved in the operation does not guarantee performance improvement. We then investigate a generalization of the operations mentioned above, finding that operations that approximate a particular form provide the best improvement. The results provided here will be valuable for real-world implementations of quantum teleportation networks and applications that harness the non-Gaussianity of quantum states.

TI A novel design update framework for topology optimization with quantum
   annealing: Application to truss and continuum structures
SO COMPUTER METHODS IN APPLIED MECHANICS AND ENGINEERING
AB This paper presents a novel design update strategy for topology optimization, as an iterative optimization. The key contribution lies in incorporating a design updater concept with quantum annealing, applicable to both truss and continuum structures. To align with density-based approaches in topology optimization, these updaters are formulated through a multiplicative relationship to represent the design material and serve as design variables. Specifically, structural analysis is conducted on a classical computer using the finite element method, while quantum annealing is utilized for topology updates. The primary objective of the framework is to minimize compliance under a volume constraint. An encoding formulation for the design variables is derived, and the penalty method along with a slack variable is employed to transform the inequality volume constraint. Subsequently, the optimization problem for determining the updater is formulated as a Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) model. To demonstrate its performance, the developed design framework is tested on different computing platforms to perform design optimization for truss structures, as well as 2D and 3D continuum structures. Numerical results indicate that the proposed framework successfully finds optimal topologies similar to benchmark results. Furthermore, the results show the advantage of reduced time in finding an optimal design using quantum annealing compared to simulated annealing.

TI Quantum Active Learning for Structural Determination of Doped
   Nanoparticles - A Case Study of 4Al@Si11
SO JOURNAL OF THE BRAZILIAN CHEMICAL SOCIETY
AB Active learning (AL) has been widely applied in chemistry and materials science. In this work, we propose a quantum active learning (QAL) method for automatic structural determination of doped nanoparticles, where quantum machine learning (QML) models for regression are used iteratively to indicate new structures to be calculated by Density Functional Theory (DFT) or Density Functional Based Tight Binding (DFTB) and this new data acquisition is used to retrain the QML models. The QAL method is implemented in the Quantum Machine Learning Software/ Agent for Material Design and Discovery (QMLMaterial), whose aim is using an artificial agent (defined by QML regression algorithms) that chooses the next doped configuration to be calculated that has a higher probability of finding the optimum structure. The QAL uses a quantum Gaussian process with a fidelity quantum kernel as well as the projected quantum kernel and different quantum circuits. For comparison, classical AL was used with classical Gaussian process with different classical kernels. The presented QAL method was applied in the structural determination of doped Si11 with 4 Al (4Al@Si11) and the results indicate the QAL method is able to find the optimum 4Al@Si11 structure. The aim of this work is to present the QAL method, formulated in a noise-free quantum computing framework, for automatic structural determination of doped nanoparticles and materials defects.

TI Criticality-enhanced quantum sensing in the anisotropic quantum Rabi
   model
SO SCIENCE CHINA-PHYSICS MECHANICS & ASTRONOMY
AB Quantum systems that undergo quantum phase transitions exhibit divergent susceptibility and can be exploited as probes to estimate physical parameters. We generalize the dynamic framework for criticality-enhanced quantum sensing by the quantum Rabi model (QRM) to its anisotropic counterpart and derive the correspondingly analytical expressions for the quantum Fisher information (QFI). We find that the contributions of the rotating-wave and counterrotating-wave interaction terms are symmetric at the limit of the infinite ratio of qubit frequency to field frequency, with the QFI reaching a maximum for the isotropic QRM. At finite frequency scaling, we analytically derive the inverted variance of higher-order correction and find that it is more affected by the rotating-wave coupling than by the counterrotating-wave coupling.

TI Quantum state transfer on Q-graphs
SO RAIRO-OPERATIONS RESEARCH
AB Given a graph G, the graph Q(G) is obtained by inserting a new vertex into every edge of G, then connecting those inserted vertices on the neighbouring edges in G. We usually refer to Q(G) as the Q-graph of G. This article mainly focuses on the effects of Q-graph operation on quantum state transfer. It is shown that if G is an integral r-regular graph for r >= 2, then Q(G) always avoids perfect state transfer. In contrast, we also show that, this Q-graph exists pretty good state transfer under some special circumstances. Subsequently, by applying the results obtained above, we also display many new classes of Q-graphs that avoid perfect state transfer but exist pretty good state transfer.

Meanwhile, variational quantum algorithms are widely proposed to solve relevant computational problems on noisy, intermediate-scale quantum devices. In this paper, we apply variational quantum algorithms to quantum support vector machines and demonstrate a proof-of-principle numerical experiment of this algorithm. In addition, in the classification stage, fewer qubits, shorter circuit depth, and simpler measurement requirements show its superiority over the former algorithms.

TI Research on Optimization of Hierarchical Quantum Circuit Scheduling
   Strategy
SO CMC-COMPUTERS MATERIALS & CONTINUA
AB Traditional quantum circuit scheduling approaches underutilize the inherent parallelism of quantum computation in the Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) era, overlook the inter-layer operations can be further parallelized. Based on this, two quantum circuit scheduling optimization approaches are designed and integrated into the quantum circuit compilation process. Firstly, we introduce the Layered Topology Scheduling Approach (LTSA), which employs a greedy algorithm and leverages the principles of topological sorting in graph theory. LTSA allocates quantum gates to a layered structure, maximizing the concurrent execution of quantum gate operations. Secondly, the Layerwise Conflict Resolution Approach (LCRA) is proposed. LCRA focuses on utilizing directly executable quantum gates within layers. Through the insertion of SWAP gates and conflict resolution checks, it minimizes conflicts and enhances parallelism, thereby optimizing the overall computational efficiency. Experimental findings indicate that LTSA and LCRA individually achieve a noteworthy reduction of 51.1% and 53.2%, respectively, in the number of inserted SWAP gates. Additionally, they contribute to a decrease in hardware gate overhead by 14.7% and 15%, respectively. Considering the intricate nature of quantum circuits and the temporal dependencies among different layers, the amalgamation of both approaches leads to a remarkable 51.6% reduction in inserted SWAP gates and a 14.8% decrease in hardware gate overhead. These results underscore the efficacy of the combined LTSA and LCRA in optimizing quantum circuit compilation.

TI Quantum and Topological Dynamics of GKSL Equation in Camel-like
   Framework
SO ENTROPY
AB We study the dynamics of von Neumann entropy driven by the Gorini-Kossakowski-Sudarshan-Lindblad (GKSL) equation, focusing on its camel-like behavior-a hump-like entropy evolution reflecting the system's adaptation to its environment. Within this framework, we analyze quantum correlations under decoherence and environmental interaction for three sets of quantum states. Our results show that the sign of the entanglement entropy's derivative serves as an indicator of the system's drift toward either classical or quantum information exchange-an insight relevant to quantum error correction and dissipation in quantum thermal machines. We parameterize quantum states using both single-parameter and Bloch-sphere representations, where the angle theta on the Bloch sphere corresponds to the state's position. On this sphere, we construct gradient and basin maps that partition the dynamics of quantum states into stable and unstable regions under decoherence. Notably, we identify a Braiding ring of decoherence-unstable states located at theta=3 pi 4; these states act as attractors under a constructed Lyapunov function, illustrating the topological and dynamical complexity of quantum evolution. Finally, we propose a testable experimental setup based on camel-like entropy and discuss its connection to the theoretical framework of this entropy behavior.

TI Violation of all two-party facet Bell inequalities by almost-quantum
   correlations
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB The characterization of the set of quantum correlations is a problem of fundamental importance in quantum information. The question whether every proper (tight) Bell inequality is violated in quantum theory is an intriguing one in this regard. Here we make significant progress in answering this question, by showing that every tight Bell inequality is violated by "almost-quantum" correlations, a semidefinite programming relaxation of the set of quantum correlations. As a consequence, we show that many (classes of) Bell inequalities including two-party correlation Bell inequalities and multioutcome nonlocal computation games, which do not admit quantum violations, are not facets of the classical Bell polytope. To do this, we make use of the intriguing connections between Bell correlations and the graph-theoretic Lovasz-theta set, discovered by Cabello-Severini-Winter (CSW). We also exploit connections between the cut polytope of graph theory and the classical correlation Bell polytope, to show that correlation Bell inequalities that define facets of the lower dimensional correlation polytope are violated in quantum theory.

TI Bidirectional state transfer between superconducting and

SO PHYSICAL REVIEW APPLIED
AB The number of superconducting qubits contained in a single quantum processor is increasing steadily. However, to realize a truly useful quantum computer, it is inevitable to increase the number of qubits much further by distributing quantum information among distant processors using flying qubits. A key element towards this goal is a deterministic quantum interaction between superconducting-atom and propagating microwave-photon qubits. Here, we confirm the bidirectional state transfer between them, which completes by simply reflecting the photon at the atom. The averaged fidelity of the photon-to-atom (atomto-photon) state transfer reaches 0.826 (0.801), limited mainly by the lifetime of the atom qubit. The present technology would be useful for future distributed quantum computation with superconducting qubits.

TI TE-PAI: exact time evolution by sampling random circuits
SO QUANTUM SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB Simulating time evolution under quantum Hamiltonians is one of the most natural applications of quantum computers. We introduce TE-PAI, which simulates time evolution exactly by sampling random quantum circuits for the purpose of estimating observable expectation values at the cost of an increased circuit repetition. The approach builds on the Probabilistic Angle Interpolation (PAI) technique and we prove that it simulates time evolution without discretisation or algorithmic error while achieving shallow circuit depths with optimal scaling that saturates the Lieb-Robinson bound. Another significant advantage of TE-PAI is that it only requires executing random circuits that consist of Pauli rotation gates of only two kinds of rotation angles +/-Delta and pi, along with measurements. While TE-PAI is highly beneficial for NISQ devices, we additionally develop an optimised early fault-tolerant implementation using catalyst circuits and repeat-until-success teleportation, concluding that the approach requires orders of magnitude fewer T-states than conventional techniques, such as Trotterization-we estimate 3x105 T states are sufficient for the fault-tolerant simulation of a 100-qubit Heisenberg spin Hamiltonian. Furthermore, TE-PAI allows for a highly configurable trade-off between circuit depth and measurement overhead by adjusting the rotation angle Delta arbitrarily. We expect that the approach will be a major enabler in the late NISQ and early fault-tolerant periods as it can compensate circuit-depth and qubit-number limitations through an increased circuit repetition.

By introducing a new quasi-greedy algorithm that is not allowed to jump over large energy barriers, we show that the problem hardness is mainly due to entropic barriers. We study, both analytically and numerically, several optimization algorithms, finding that entropic barriers affect in a similar way classical local algorithms and quantum annealing. For the adiabatic algorithm, the difficulty we identify is distinct from that of tunneling under large barriers, but does, nonetheless, give rise to exponential running (annealing) times.

TI Simulating quantum chemistry in the seniority-zero space on qubit-based
   quantum computers
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Accurate quantum chemistry simulations remain challenging on classical computers for problems of industrially relevant sizes and there is reason for hope that quantum computing may help push the boundaries of what is technically feasible. While variational quantum eigensolver algorithms may already turn noisy intermediate scale quantum (NISQ) devices into useful machines, one has to make all efforts to use the scarce quantum resources as efficiently as possible. We combine the so-called seniority-zero, or paired-electron, approximation of computational quantum chemistry with techniques for simulating molecular chemistry on gate-based quantum computers and obtain a very resource efficient quantum simulation algorithm. While some accuracy is lost through the paired-electron approximation, we show that using the freed-up quantum resources for increasing the basis set can lead to more accurate results and reductions in the necessary number of quantum computing runs by several orders of magnitude, already for a simple system like lithium hydride. We also discuss an error mitigation scheme based on postselection which shows an attractive scaling when the given Hamiltonian format is considered, increasing the viability of its NISQ implementation.

TI Transfer of Quantum States and Stationary Quantum Correlations in a
   Hybrid Optomechanical Network
SO MATHEMATICS
AB We present a systematic study on the effects of dynamical transfer and steady-state synchronization of quantum states in a hybrid optomechanical network consisting of two cavities, which carry atoms inside and interact via a common moving mirror such as the mechanical oscillator. It is found that a high fidelity transfer of Schrodinger's cat and squeezed states between two cavities modes is possible. On the other hand, we demonstrate the synchronization effect of the cavity modes in a steady squeezed state with its high fidelity realized by the mechanical oscillator that intermediates the generation, transfer and stabilization of the squeezing. In this framework, we also study the generation and evolution of bipartite and tripartite entanglement and find its connection to the effects of quantum state transfer and synchronization. Particularly, when the transfer occurs at the maximal fidelity, any entanglement is almost zero, so the different cavity modes are disentangled. However, these modes become entangled when the two bosonic modes are synchronized in a stationary squeezed state. The results provided by the current study may find applications in quantum information technologies, in addition to the setups for metrology, where squeezed states are essential.

AB Recent experiments show the existence of collective decoherence in quantum systems. We study the possibility of quantum computation in a decoherence-free subspace which is robust against such kinds of decoherence processes. This passive protection protocol can be especially advantageous for continuous quantum computation such as quantum annealers. As an example we propose to use decoherence-protected adiabatic quantum computation for the Grover search problem.

TI Dynamical phase transitions of information flow in random quantum
   circuits
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB We study how the information flows in many-body dynamics governed by random quantum circuits and discover a rich set of dynamical phase transitions in this information flow. The phase-transition points and their critical exponents are established across Clifford and Haar random circuits through finite-size scaling. The flow of both classical and quantum information, measured respectively by Holevo and coherent information, shows similar dynamical phase transition behaviors. We investigate how the phase transitions depend on the initial location of the information and the final probe region, and find ubiquitous behaviors in these transitions, revealing interesting properties about the information propagation and scrambling in this quantum many-body model. Our paper underscores rich behaviors of the information flow in large systems with numerous phase transitions, thereby sheds light on the understanding of quantum many-body dynamics.

TI The future of secure communications: Device independence in quantum key
   distribution
SO PHYSICS REPORTS-REVIEW SECTION OF PHYSICS LETTERS
AB In the ever-evolving landscape of quantum cryptography, Device-independent Quantum Key Distribution (DI-QKD) stands out for its unique approach to ensuring security based not on the trustworthiness of the devices but on nonlocal correlations. Beginning with a contextual understanding of modern cryptographic security and the limitations of standard quantum key distribution methods, this review explores the pivotal role of nonclassicality and the challenges posed by various experimental loopholes for DI-QKD. Various protocols, security against individual, collective and coherent attacks, and the concept of self-testing are also examined, as well as the entropy accumulation theorem, and additional mathematical methods in formulating advanced security proofs. In addition, the burgeoning field of semi-device-independent models (measurement DI-QKD, Receiver DI-QKD, and One-sided DI-QKD) is also analyzed. The practical aspects are discussed through a detailed overview of experimental progress and the open challenges towards the commercial deployment in the future of secure communications.

TI Toward pricing financial derivatives with an IBM quantum computer
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Pricing interest-rate financial derivatives is a major problem in finance, in which it is crucial to accurately reproduce the time evolution of interest rates. Several stochastic dynamics have been proposed in the literature to model either the instantaneous interest rate or the instantaneous forward rate. A successful approach to model the latter is the celebrated Heath-Jarrow-Morton framework, in which its dynamics is entirely specified by volatility factors. In its multifactor version, this model considers several noisy components to capture at best the dynamics of several time-maturing forward rates. However, as no general analytical solution is available, there is a trade-off between the number of noisy factors considered and the computational time to perform a numerical simulation. Here, we employ the quantum principal component analysis to reduce the number of noisy factors required to accurately simulate the time evolution of several time-maturing forward rates. The principal components are experimentally estimated with the five-qubit IBMQX2 quantum computer for 2 x 2 and 3 x 3 cross-correlation matrices, which are based on historical data for two and three time-maturing forward rates. This paper is a step towards the design of a general quantum algorithm to fully simulate on quantum computers the HeathJarrow-Morton model for pricing interest-rate financial derivatives. It shows indeed that practical applications of quantum computers in finance will be achievable in the near future.

TI Quantum gates with weak van der Waals interactions of neutral Rydberg
   atoms
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Neutral atoms are promising for large-scale quantum computing, but accurate neutral-atom entanglement depends on large Rydberg interactions which strongly limit the interatomic distances. Via a phase accumulation in detuned Rabi cycles enabled by a Rydberg interaction of similar magnitude to the Rydberg Rabi frequency, we study a controlled-phase gate with an arbitrary phase and extend it to the controlled-NOT gate. The gates need only three steps for coupling one Rydberg state, depend on an easily accessible van der Waals interaction that naturally arises between distant atoms, and have no rotation error in the weak interaction regime. Importantly, they can work with very weak interactions so that well-separated qubits can be entangled. The gates are sensitive to the irremovable fluctuation of Rydberg interactions, but can still have a fidelity over 98% with realistic position fluctuation of qubits separated over 20 p.m.

TI Optimizing electronic structure simulations on a trapped-ion quantum
   computer using problem decomposition
SO COMMUNICATIONS PHYSICS
AB Problem decomposition methods may help to overcome the size limitations of quantum hardware and allow largescale electronic structure simulations. Here, a method to simulate a ten-atom Hydrogen ring by decomposing it into smaller fragments that are amenable to a currently available trapped ion quantum computer is demonstrated experimentally.
   Quantum computers have the potential to advance material design and drug discovery by performing costly electronic structure calculations. A critical aspect of this application requires optimizing the limited resources of the quantum hardware. Here, we experimentally demonstrate an end-to-end pipeline that focuses on minimizing quantum resources while maintaining accuracy. Using density matrix embedding theory as a problem decomposition technique, and an ion-trap quantum computer, we simulate a ring of 10 hydrogen atoms without freezing any electrons. The originally 20-qubit system is decomposed into 10 two-qubit problems, making it amenable to currently available hardware. Combining this decomposition with a qubit coupled cluster circuit ansatz, circuit optimization, and density matrix purification, we accurately reproduce the potential energy curve in agreement with the full configuration interaction energy in the minimal basis set. Our experimental results are an early demonstration of the potential for problem decomposition to accurately simulate large molecules on quantum hardware.

   Distribution
SO ENTROPY
AB Quantum key distribution (QKD) is a promising technique to share unconditionally secure keys between remote parties. As an essential part of a practical QKD system, reconciliation is responsible for correcting the errors due to the quantum channel noise by exchanging information through a public classical channel. In the present work, we propose a novel syndrome-based low-density parity-check (LDPC) reconciliation protocol to reduce the information leakage of reconciliation by fully utilizing the syndrome information that was previously wasted. Both theoretical analysis and simulation results show that our protocol can evidently reduce the information leakage as well as the number of communication rounds.

TI Almost Qudits in the Prepare-and-Measure Scenario
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB Quantum communication is often investigated in scenarios where only the dimension of Hilbert space is known. However, assigning a precise dimension is often an approximation of what is actually a higher-dimensional process. Here, we introduce and investigate quantum information encoded in carriers that nearly, but not entirely, correspond to standard qudits. We demonstrate the relevance of this concept for semi-device-independent quantum information by showing how small higher-dimensional components can significantly compromise the conclusions of established protocols. Then we provide a general method, based on semidefinite relaxations, for bounding the set of almost qudit correlations, and apply it to remedy the demonstrated issues. This method also offers a novel systematic approach to the well-known task of device-independent tests of classical and quantum dimensions with unentangled devices. Finally, we also consider viewing almost qubit systems as a physical resource available to the experimenter and determine the optimal quantum protocol for the well-known random access code.

We aim to harness this potential to enhance ray casting, a pivotal technique in computer graphics for simplifying the rendering of 3D objects. To perform ray casting in a quantum computer, we need to encode the defining parameters of primitives into qubits. However, during the current noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) era, challenges arise from the limited number of qubits and the impact of noise when executing multiple gates. Through logic optimization, we reduced the depth of quantum circuits as well as the number of gates and qubits. As a result, the event count of correct measurements from an IBM quantum computer significantly exceeded that of incorrect measurements.

TI Facilitating practical fault-tolerant quantum computing based on color
   codes
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Color codes are a promising topological code for fault-tolerant quantum computing. Insufficient research on color codes has delayed their practical application. In this work, we address several key issues to facilitate practical fault-tolerant quantum computing based on color codes. First, by introducing decoding graphs with error-rate-related weights, we obtain the threshold of 0.47% of the 6.6.6 triangular color code under the standard circuit-level noise model, narrowing the gap to that of the surface code. Second, our work first investigates the circuit-level decoding of color code lattice surgery, then gives an efficient decoding algorithm, which is crucial to perform logical operations in a quantum computer with two-dimensional architectures. Last, a state injection protocol of the triangular color code is proposed, reducing the output magic state error rate in one round of 15 to 1 distillation by two orders of magnitude compared to a previous rough protocol. We also prove that our protocol offers the lowest logical error rates for state injection among all possible CSS codes.

TI Quantum-Inspired Machine Learning for 6G: Fundamentals, Security,
   Resource Allocations, Challenges, and Future Research Directions
SO IEEE OPEN JOURNAL OF VEHICULAR TECHNOLOGY
AB Quantum computing is envisaged as an evolving paradigm for solving computationally complex optimization problems with a large-number factorization and exhaustive search. Recently, there has been a proliferating growth of the size of multi-dimensional datasets, the input-output space dimensionality, and data structures. Hence, the conventional machine learning approaches in data training and processing have exhibited their limited computing capabilities to support the sixth-generation (6G) networks with highly dynamic applications and services. In this regard, the fast developing quantum computing with machine learning for 6G networks is investigated. Quantum machine learning algorithm can significantly enhance the processing efficiency and exponentially computational speed-up for effective quantum data representation and superposition framework, highly capable of guaranteeing high data storage and secured communications. We present the state-of-the-art in quantum computing and provide a comprehensive overview of its potential, via machine learning approaches. Furthermore, we introduce quantum-inspired machine learning applications for 6G networks in terms of resource allocation and network security, considering their enabling technologies and potential challenges. Finally, some dominating research issues and future research directions for the quantum-inspired machine learning in 6G networks are elaborated.

TI Verifiable anonymous quantum communication with authentication based on
   d-level single-particle states
SO PHYSICA SCRIPTA
AB Anonymous quantum communication (AQC) enables the secure transmission of classical and quantum messages while preserving the anonymity of the sender, receiver, or both. Qudits, quantum states with more advantages than qubits in terms of information transmission rate and eavesdropping detection, offer promising capabilities. In this paper, we propose a verifiable AQC (VAQC) protocol utilizing d-level single-particle states, establishing anonymous entanglement between a public sender and an anonymous receiver. By using quantum teleportation, the public sender can transmit private information to his/her chosen anonymous receiver. The verifiable function of the proposed protocol guarantees the legitimacy of all participants' identities and verifies the correctness of the anonymous entanglement. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the proposed VAQC protocol satisfies the requirements of correctness, anonymity, and security. The proposed VAQC protocol exhibits extensibility and can be extended to enable private communication between an anonymous sender and an anonymous receiver, as well as anonymous entanglement among multiple participants. This work lays the foundation for practical applications in achieving d-level anonymous entanglement and anonymous transmission of qudits.

TI Cutting circuits with multiple two-qubit unitaries
SO QUANTUM
AB Quasiprobabilistic cutting techniques allow us to partition large quantum circuits into smaller sub circuits by replacing non-local gates with probabilistic mixtures of local gates. The cost of this method is a sampling overhead that scales exponentially in the number of cuts. It is crucial to determine the minimal cost for gate cutting and to understand whether allowing for classical communication between sub circuits can improve the sampling overhead. In this work, we derive a closed formula for the optimal sampling overhead for cutting an arbitrary number of two-qubit unitaries and provide the corresponding decomposition. We find that cutting several arbitrary two-qubit unitaries together is cheaper than cutting them individually and classical communication does not give any advantage.

TI Dynamic control of Purcell enhanced emission of erbium ions in
   nanoparticles
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB The interaction of single quantum emitters with an optical cavity enables the realization of efficient spin-photon interfaces, an essential resource for quantum networks. The dynamical control of the spontaneous emission rate of quantum emitters in cavities has important implications in quantum technologies, e.g., for shaping the emitted photons' waveform or for driving coherently the optical transition while preventing photon emission. Here we demonstrate the dynamical control of the Purcell enhanced emission of a small ensemble of erbium ions doped into a nanoparticle. By embedding the nanoparticles into a fully tunable high finesse fiber based optical microcavity, we demonstrate a median Purcell factor of 15 for the ensemble of ions. We also show that we can dynamically control the Purcell enhanced emission by tuning the cavity on and out of resonance, by controlling its length with sub-nanometer precision on a time scale more than two orders of magnitude faster than the natural lifetime of the erbium ions. This capability opens prospects for the realization of efficient nanoscale quantum interfaces between solid-state spins and single telecom photons with controllable waveform, for non-destructive detection of photonic qubits, and for the realization of quantum gates between rare-earth ion qubits coupled to an optical cavity. Control of quantum emitters is needed in order to enable many applications. Here, the authors demonstrate enhancement and dynamical control of the Purcell emission from erbium ions doped in a nanoparticle within a fiber-based microcavity.

TI Nonclassical Attack on a Quantum Key Distribution System
SO ENTROPY
AB The article is focused on research of an attack on the quantum key distribution system and proposes a countermeasure method. Particularly noteworthy is that this is not a classic attack on a quantum protocol. We describe an attack on the process of calibration. Results of the research show that quantum key distribution systems have vulnerabilities not only in the protocols, but also in other vital system components. The described type of attack does not affect the cryptographic strength of the received keys and does not point to the vulnerability of the quantum key distribution protocol. We also propose a method for autocompensating optical communication system development, which protects synchronization from unauthorized access. The proposed method is based on the use of sync pulses attenuated to a photon level in the process of detecting a time interval with a signal. The paper presents the results of experimental studies that show the discrepancies between the theoretical and real parameters of the system. The obtained data allow the length of the quantum channel to be calculated with high accuracy.

TI Quantum-resistant Transport Layer Security
SO COMPUTER COMMUNICATIONS
AB The reliance on asymmetric public key cryptography (PKC) and symmetric encryption for cyber-security in current telecommunication networks is threatened by the emergence of powerful quantum computing technology. This is due to the ability of quantum computers to efficiently solve problems such as factorization or discrete logarithms, which are the basis for classical PKC schemes. Thus, the assumption that communications networks are secure no longer holds true. Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) and post-quantum cryptography (PQC) are the first cyber-security technologies that allow communications to resist the attacks of a quantum computer. To achieve quantum-resistant communications, the aforementioned technologies need to be incorporated into a network security protocol such as Transport Layer Security (TLS). In this paper, we describe and implement two novel, hybrid solutions in which QKD and PQC are combined inside TLS for achieving quantum-resistant authenticated key exchange: Concatenation and Exclusively-OR (XOR). We present the results, in terms of complexity and security enhancement, of integrating state-of-the-art QKD and PQC technologies into a practical, industry-ready TLS implementation. Our findings demonstrate that the adoption of a PQC-only approach enhances the TLS handshake performance by approximately 9% compared to classical methods. Furthermore, our hybrid PQC-QKD quantum-resistant TLS comes at a performance cost of approximately 117% during the key establishment process. In return, we substantially augment the security of the handshake, paving the road for the development of future-proof quantum-resistant communication systems based on QKD and PQC.

TI Diabatic quantum annealing for the frustrated ring model
SO QUANTUM SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB Quantum annealing (QA) is a continuous-time heuristic quantum algorithm for solving or approximately solving classical optimization problems. The algorithm uses a schedule to interpolate between a driver Hamiltonian with an easy-to-prepare ground state and a problem Hamiltonian whose ground state encodes solutions to an optimization problem. The standard implementation relies on the evolution being adiabatic: keeping the system in the instantaneous ground state with high probability and requiring a time scale inversely related to the minimum energy gap between the instantaneous ground and excited states. However, adiabatic evolution can lead to evolution times that scale exponentially with the system size, even for computationally simple problems. Here, we study whether non-adiabatic evolutions with optimized annealing schedules can bypass this exponential slowdown for one such class of problems called the frustrated ring model. For sufficiently optimized annealing schedules and system sizes of up to 39 qubits, we provide numerical evidence that we can avoid the exponential slowdown. Our work highlights the potential of highly-controllable QA to circumvent bottlenecks associated with the standard implementation of QA.

TI Hamiltonian switching control of noisy bipartite qubit systems
SO NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB We develop a Hamiltonian switching ansatz for bipartite control that is inspired by the quantum approximate optimization algorithm, to mitigate environmental noise on qubits. We demonstrate the control for a central spin coupled to bath spins via isotropic Heisenberg interactions, and then make physical applications to the protection of quantum gates performed on superconducting transmon qubits coupling to environmental two-level-systems (TLSs) through dipole-dipole interactions, as well as on such qubits coupled to both TLSs and a Lindblad bath. The control field is classical and acts only on the system qubits. We use reinforcement learning with policy gradient to optimize the Hamiltonian switching control protocols, using a fidelity objective for specific target quantum gates. We use this approach to demonstrate effective suppression of both coherent and dissipative noise, with numerical studies achieving target gate implementations with fidelities over 0.9999 (four nines) in the majority of our test cases and showing improvement beyond this to values of 0.999 999 999 (nine nines) upon a subsequent optimization by GRadient Ascent Pulse Engineering (GRAPE). We analyze how the control depth, total evolution time, number of environmental TLS, and choice of optimization method affect the fidelity achieved by the optimal protocols and reveal some critical behaviors of bipartite control of quantum gates.

TI Exploiting Symmetry in Variational Quantum Machine Learning
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB Variational quantum machine learning is an extensively studied application of near-term quantum computers. The success of variational quantum learning models crucially depends on finding a suitable parametrization of the model that encodes an inductive bias relevant to the learning task. However, pre-cious little is known about guiding principles for the construction of suitable parametrizations. In this work, we holistically explore when and how symmetries of the learning problem can be exploited to con-struct quantum learning models with outcomes invariant under the symmetry of the learning task. Building on tools from representation theory, we show how a standard gateset can be transformed into an equivari-ant gateset that respects the symmetries of the problem at hand through a process of gate symmetrization. We benchmark the proposed methods on two toy problems that feature a nontrivial symmetry and observe a substantial increase in generalization performance. As our tools can also be applied in a straightforward way to other variational problems with symmetric structure, we show how equivariant gatesets can be used in variational quantum eigensolvers.

TI Research on Secure Communication on In-Vehicle Ethernet Based on
   Post-Quantum Algorithm NTRUEncrypt
SO ELECTRONICS
AB In the context of the evolution of in-vehicle electronic and electrical architecture as well as the rapid development of quantum computers, post-quantum algorithms, such as NTRUEncrypt, are of great significance for in-vehicle secure communications. In this paper, we propose and evaluate, for the first time, a NTRUEncrypt enhanced session key negotiation for the in-vehicle Ethernet context. Specifically, the time consumption and memory occupation of the NTRUEncrypt Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman (ECDH), and Rivest-Shamir-Adleman (RSA) algorithms, which are used for session key negotiation, are measured and compared. The result shows that, besides the NTRUEncrypt's particular attribute of resisting quantum computer attacks, the execution speed of session key negotiation using NTRUEncrypt is 66.06 times faster than ECDH, and 1530.98 times faster than RSA at the 128-bit security level. The memory occupation of the algorithms is at the same order of magnitude. As the transport layer security (TLS) protocol can fulfill most performance requirements of the automotive industry, post-quantum enhanced session key negotiation will probably be widely used for in-vehicle Ethernet communication.

TI Bi-directional controlled asymmetric teleportation protocol initiated by
   a mentor in noisy environments
SO PHYSICA SCRIPTA
AB In this paper we consider the problem of the bidirectional state transfer of a 2-qubit and a 3-qubit quantum state unknown to the parties, respectively, who intend to send the respective states in the site of the other party. These states are intended for transfer but are not possessed by the intender. The protocol has a Mentor whose role is in the fabrication of entangled channels, distribution of qubits through the noisy environment in order to create entanglement sharing and finally fixing one of the several courses of the protocol. The role of the Mentor is thereby completed. The protocol is overseen by a controller whose action signals the final steps to be taken in the protocol. Three types of noises are considered through three different Kraus operators. There is an analysis of the fidelity of the protocol corresponding to three types of noises.

TI Quantum dual extended Hamming code immune to collective coherent errors
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Collective coherent (CC) errors are inevitable, as every physical qubit undergoes free evolution under its kinetic Hamiltonian. These errors can be more damaging than stochastic Pauli errors because they affect all qubits coherently, resulting in high-weight errors that standard quantum error-correcting (QEC) codes struggle to correct. In quantum memories and communication systems, especially when storage durations are long, CC errors often dominate over stochastic noise. Trapped-ion platforms, for example, exhibit strong CC errors with minimal stochastic Pauli components. In this work, we address the regime where immunity to CC errors, high code rate (due to limited qubit availability), and moderate distance (sufficient for correcting low-weight errors) are all essential. We construct a family of constant-excitation stabilizer codes with parameters [[2r+1, 2r - (r + 1), 4]]. The smallest instance, the [[8,1,4]] code, improves the code rate and error threshold of the best previously known CE code by factors of approximately two and four, respectively.

TI Design and Simulation of a Transmon Qubit Chip for Axion Detection
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON APPLIED SUPERCONDUCTIVITY
AB Quantum Sensing is a rapidly expanding research field that finds one of its applications in fundamental physics, as the search for Dark Matter. Devices based on superconducting qubits have already been successfully applied in detecting few-GHz single photons via Quantum Non-Demolition measurement (QND). This technique allows us to perform repeatable measurements, bringing remarkable sensitivity improvements and dark count rate suppression in experiments based on high-precision microwave photon detection, such as for Axions and Dark Photons search. In this context, the INFN Qub-IT project goal is to realize an itinerant single-photon counter based on superconducting qubits that will exploit QND for enhancing Axion search experiments. In this study, we present Qub-IT's status towards the realization of its first superconducting qubit device, illustrating design and simulation procedures and the characterization of fabricated Coplanar Waveguide Resonators (CPWs) for readout. We match target qubit parameters and assess a few-percent level agreement between lumped and distributed element simulation models. We reach a maximum internal quality factor of 9.2 x 10(5) for -92 dBm on-chip readout power.

SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF COMPUTER MATHEMATICS- COMPUTER SYSTEMS THEORY
AB We discuss the connection between quantum error-correcting codes (QECCS) and algebraic coding theory. We start with an introduction to the relevant concepts of quantum mechanics, including the general error model. A quantum error-correcting code is a subspace of a complex Hilbert space, and its error-correcting properties are characterized by the Knill-Laflamme conditions. Using the stabilizer formalism, we illustrate how QECCs for can be constructed using techniques from algebraic coding theory. We also sketch how the information obtained via a quantum measurement can be interpreted as syndrome of the related classical code. Additionally, we present secondary constructions for QECCs, leading to propagation rules for the parameters of QECCs. This includes the puncture code by Rains and construction X for quantum codes.

TI RF and microwave metrology for quantum computing - recent developments
   at the UK's National Physical Laboratory
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MICROWAVE AND WIRELESS TECHNOLOGIES
AB Development of large-scale quantum computing systems will require radio frequency (RF) and microwave technologies operating reliably at cryogenic temperatures down to tens of milli-Kelvin (mK). The quantum bits in the most promising quantum computing technologies such as the superconducting quantum computing are designed using principles of microwave engineering and operated using microwave signals. The control, readout, and coupling of qubits are implemented using a network of microwave components operating at various temperature stages. To ensure reliable operation of quantum computing systems, it is critical to ensure optimal performance of these microwave components and qubits at their respective operating temperatures, which can be as low as mK temperatures. It is, therefore, critical to understand the microwave characteristics of waveforms, components, circuits, networks, and systems at cryogenic temperatures. The UK's National Physical Laboratory (NPL) is focussed on developing new microwave measurement capabilities through the UK's National Quantum Technologies Programme to address various microwave test and measurement challenges in quantum computing. This includes the development of various measurement capabilities to characterize the microwave performance of quantum and microwave devices and substrate materials at cryogenic temperatures. This paper summarizes the roadmap of activities at NPL to address these microwave metrology challenges in quantum computing.

TI Satellite-to-aircraft quantum key distribution performance estimation
   with boundary layer effects
SO CHINESE OPTICS LETTERS
AB Remarkable progress has been made in satellite-based quantum key distribution (QKD), which can effectively provide QKD service even at the intercontinental scale and construct an ultralong-distance global quantum network. But there are still some places where terrestrial fiber and ground stations cannot be constructed, like harsh mountainous areas and air space above the sea. So the airborne platform is expected to replace the ground station and provide flexible and relay links for the large-scale integrated communication network. However, the photon transmission rate would be randomly reduced, owing to the randomly distributed boundary layer that surrounds the surface of the aircraft when the flight speed is larger than 0.3 Ma. Previous research of airborne QKD with boundary layer effects is mainly under the air-to-ground scenario in which the aircraft is a transmitter, while the satellite-to-aircraft scenario is rarely reported. In this article, we propose a per-formance evaluation scheme of satellite-to-aircraft QKD with boundary layer effects in which the aircraft is the receiver. With common experimental settings, the boundary layer would introduce a -31 dB loss to the transmitted photons, decrease -47% of the quantum communication time, and decrease -51% of the secure key rate, which shows that the aero-optical effects caused by the boundary layer cannot be ignored. Our study can be performed in future airborne quan-tum communication designs.

TI Leveraging Data Locality in Quantum Convolutional Classifiers
SO ENTROPY
AB Quantum computing (QC) has opened the door to advancements in machine learning (ML) tasks that are currently implemented in the classical domain. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are classical ML architectures that exploit data locality and possess a simpler structure than a fully connected multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs) without compromising the accuracy of classification. However, the concept of preserving data locality is usually overlooked in the existing quantum counterparts of CNNs, particularly for extracting multifeatures in multidimensional data. In this paper, we present an multidimensional quantum convolutional classifier (MQCC) that performs multidimensional and multifeature quantum convolution with average and Euclidean pooling, thus adapting the CNN structure to a variational quantum algorithm (VQA). The experimental work was conducted using multidimensional data to validate the correctness and demonstrate the scalability of the proposed method utilizing both noisy and noise-free quantum simulations. We evaluated the MQCC model with reference to reported work on state-of-the-art quantum simulators from IBM Quantum and Xanadu using a variety of standard ML datasets. The experimental results show the favorable characteristics of our proposed techniques compared with existing work with respect to a number of quantitative metrics, such as the number of training parameters, cross-entropy loss, classification accuracy, circuit depth, and quantum gate count.

TI Long-lived and multiplexed atom-photon entanglement interface with
   feed-forward-controlled readouts
SO COMMUNICATIONS PHYSICS
AB Quantum interfaces (QIs) that generate entanglement between photonic and spin-wave (atomic memory) qubits are basic building block for quantum repeaters. Realizing ensemble-based repeaters in practice requires quantum memory providing long lifetimes and multimode capacity. Significant progress has been achieved on these separate goals. The remaining challenge is to combine the two attributes into a single QI. Here, by establishing spatial multimode, magnetic-field-insensitive and long-wavelength spin-wave storage in laser-cooled atoms inside a phase-passively-stabilized polarization interferometer, we constructed a multiplexed QI that stores up to three long-lived spin-wave qubits. Using a feed-forward-controlled system, we demonstrated that a multiplexed QI gives rise to a 3-fold increase in the atom-photon (photon-photon) entanglement-generation probability compared with single-mode QIs. For our multiplexed QI, the measured Bell parameter is 2.51 +/- 0.01 combined with a memory lifetime of up to 1 ms. This work represents a key step forward in realizing fiber-based long-distance quantum communications.

TI Scalable Improvement of the Generalized Toffoli Gate Realization Using
   Trapped-Ion-Based Qutrits
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB An efficient implementation of the Toffoli gate is of conceptual importance for running various quantum algorithms, including Grover's search and Shor's integer factorization. However, direct implementation of the Toffoli gate either entails a prohibitive increase in the number of two-qubit gates or requires ancilla qubits, whereas both of these resources are limited in the current generation of noisy intermediate-scale quantum devices. Here, we experimentally demonstrate a scalable N-qubit Toffoli gate improvement using 171Yb+ trapped-ion-based optical-metastable-ground encoded qutrits for the cases of up to N = 10. With the use of the M & oslash;lmer-S & oslash;rensen gate as a basic entangling operation, we compare the standard qubit decomposition with the qutrit approach, where upper levels are used as ancillae. The presented decomposition requires only global control of the ancilla levels, which simplifies experimental implementation of the proposed approach. Using the example of a three-qubit Grover's search, we also demonstrate an increase in the algorithm's accuracy by monitoring the leakage from the qubit subspace during a qutrit-based Toffoli gate implementation.

TI Review on quantum advantages of sampling problems
SO ACTA PHYSICA SINICA
AB Exploiting the coherence and entanglement of quantum many-qubit states, quantum computing can significantly surpass classical algorithms, making it possible to factor large numbers, solve linear equations, simulate many-body quantum systems, etc., in a reasonable time. With the rapid development of quantum computing hardware, many attention has been drawn to explore how quantum computers could go beyond the limit of classical computation. Owing to the need of a universal fault-tolerant quantum computer for many existing quantum algorithms, such as Shor' s factoring algorithm, and considering the limit of near-term quantum devices with small qubit numbers and short coherence times, many recent works focused on the exploration of demonstrating quantum advantages using noisy intermediate-scaled quantum devices and shallow circuits, and hence some sampling problems have been proposed as the candidates for quantum advantage demonstration. This review summarizes quantum advantage problems that are realizable on current quantum hardware. We focus on two notable problems-random circuit simulation and boson sampling-and consider recent theoretical and experimental progresses. After the respective demonstrations of these two types of quantum advantages on superconducting and optical quantum platforms, we expect current and near-term quantum devices could be employed for demonstrating quantum advantages in general problems.

TI Parallelizing quantum simulation with decision diagrams

AB Recent technological advancements show promise in leveraging quantum mechanical phenomena for computation. This brings substantial speed-ups to problems that are once considered to be intractable in the classical world. However, the physical realization of quantum computers is still far away from us, and a majority of research work is done using quantum simulators running on classical computers. Classical computers face a critical obstacle in simulating quantum algorithms. Quantum states reside in a Hilbert space whose size grows exponentially to the number of subsystems, i.e., qubits. As a result, the straightforward statevector approach does not scale due to the exponential growth of the memory requirement. Decision diagrams have gained attention in recent years for representing quantum states and operations in quantum simulations. The main advantage of this approach is its ability to exploit redundancy. However, mainstream quantum simulators still rely on statevectors or tensor networks. We consider the absence of decision diagrams due to the lack of parallelization strategies. This work explores several strategies for parallelizing decision diagram operations, specifically for quantum simulations. We propose optimal parallelization strategies. Based on the experiment results, our parallelization strategy achieves a 2-3 times faster simulation of Grover's algorithm and random circuits than the state-of-the-art single-thread DD-based simulator DDSIM.

TI Design and analysis of quantum powered support vector machines for

SO JOURNAL OF INTELLIGENT SYSTEMS
AB The rapid pace of development over the last few decades in the domain of machine learning mirrors the advances made in the field of quantum computing. It is natural to ask whether the conventional machine learning algorithms could be optimized using the present-day noisy intermediate-scale quantum technology. There are certain computational limitations while training a machine learning model on a classical computer. Using quantum computation, it is possible to surpass these limitations and carry out such calculations in an optimized manner. This study illustrates the working of the quantum support vector machine classification model which guarantees an exponential speed-up over its typical alternatives. This research uses the quantum SVM model to solve the classification task of a malignant breast cancer diagnosis. This study also demonstrates a comparative analysis of distinct forms of SVM algorithms concerning their time complexity and performances on standard evaluation metrics, namely accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score, to exemplify the supremacy of quantum SVM over its conventional variants.

TI Designs for a two-dimensional Si quantum dot array with spin qubit
   addressability
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB Electron spins in Si are an attractive platform for quantum computation, backed with their scalability and fast, high-fidelity quantum logic gates. Despite the importance of two-dimensional integration with efficient connectivity between qubits for medium- to large-scale quantum computation, however, a practical device design that guarantees qubit addressability is yet to be seen. Here, we propose a practical 3 x 3 quantum dot device design and a larger-scale design as a longer-term target. The design goal is to realize qubit connectivity to the four nearest neighbors while ensuring addressability. We show that a 3 x 3 quantum dot array can execute four-qubit Grover's algorithm more efficiently than the one-dimensional counterpart. To scale up the two-dimensional array beyond 3 x 3, we propose a novel structure with ferromagnetic gate electrodes. Our results showcase the possibility of medium-sized quantum processors in Si with fast quantum logic gates and long coherence times.

TI Quantum architecture search for optimizing quantum generators in quantum
   GAN
SO MACHINE LEARNING-SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB As quantum computing continues to advance alongside machine learning, Quantum Generative Adversarial Networks (QGANs) have gained attention as a compelling generative modeling approach in quantum machine learning. Despite their potential, most existing QGAN implementations rely on manually designed quantum circuits, which often suffer from high complexity and limited scalability. To overcome these limitations, we propose a Quantum Architecture Search (QAS) method built upon the SuperCircuit framework. This approach enables the automatic discovery of efficient quantum circuit structures tailored for generative tasks, thereby reducing gate count. However, applying SuperCircuit-based QAS directly to QGANs presents two primary challenges: an expansive search space and a lack of guarantees regarding circuit efficiency. To mitigate these issues, we incorporate Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and a PCA-guided feature distribution mechanism during preprocessing. This strategy both compresses the search space and ensures balanced allocation of principal components across sub-generators. Extensive experiments confirm the viability of the proposed framework. When employing the discovered quantum circuits, QAS-QGAN achieves image quality comparable to a state-of-the-art (SOTA) baseline (Silver et al 2023 2023 IEEE/CVF Int. Conf. on Computer Vision (ICCV) pp 7007-16) on both the MNIST and Fashion MNIST datasets. Notably, our model reduces the number of two-qubit gates by 52.08% on MNIST and 52.92% on Fashion MNIST, highlighting substantial improvements in quantum resource efficiency. Furthermore, the model successfully generates high-resolution facial images ( 109x89) on the CelebA dataset, demonstrating strong scalability and practical applicability.

TI Neural-network-designed three-qubit gates robust against charge noise
   and crosstalk in silicon
SO QUANTUM SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB Spin qubits in semiconductor quantum dots are a promising platform for quantum computing, however, scaling to large systems is hampered by crosstalk and charge noise. Crosstalk here refers to the unwanted off-resonant rotation of idle qubits during the resonant rotation of the target qubit. For a three-qubit system with crosstalk and charge noise, it is difficult to analytically create gate protocols that produce three-qubit gates, such as the Toffoli gate, directly in a single shot instead of through the composition of two-qubit gates. Therefore, we numerically optimize a physics-informed neural network to produce theoretically robust shaped pulses that generate a Toffoli-equivalent gate. Additionally, robust pi 2 X and Controlled-Z gates are also presented in this work to create a universal set of gates robust against charge noise. The robust pulses maintain an infidelity of 10-3 for average quasistatic fluctuations in the voltage of up to a few mV instead of tenths of mV for non-robust pulses.

TI A Lower Size, Weight Acquisition and Tracking System for Airborne
   Quantum Communication
SO IEEE PHOTONICS JOURNAL
AB The features of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), such as strong manoeuvrability, small size, and light weight, make them considered to participate in free space optical (FSO) quantum communication, becoming an important part of the Space-Air-Ground Integrated Network. However, research reports on small-sized drones based long-range optical quantum link are few. A major challenge is that traditional opto-mechanical structure is difficult to adapt to small UAV platforms. Here, a lower size, weight, and power (SWaP) acquisition and tracking system prototype is developed, and its greatest advantage is that the system can be easily integrated into small flying platforms and quickly build a long-distance quantum communication link. The prototype weighs less than 8 kg. A small-sized two-axis mirror mechanism is designed for wide-range acquisition and tracking. Moreover, the system can automatically point to ground station. The SWaP acquisition and tracking system can support quantum key distribution (QKD) link and general FSO link by drones. In the 7 km air-to-ground demonstration, the acquisition and tracking system prototype is tested in practice, which is suspended under the small six-rotor UAV platform, and a special passive vibration isolation unit is added in between. A ten-minute continuous and stable beacon tracking proves that the system can quickly and automatically align.

TI Few-Mode-Fiber Technology Fine-tunes Losses in Quantum Communication
   Systems
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW APPLIED
AB A natural choice for quantum communication is to use the relative phase between two paths of a single photon for information encoding. This method was nevertheless quickly identified as impractical over long distances, and thus a modification based on single-photon time bins has become widely adopted. It, how-ever, introduces a fundamental loss, which increases with the dimension and limits its application over long distances. Here solve this long-standing hurdle by using a few-mode-fiber space-division-multiplexing platform working with orbital-angular-momentum modes. In our scheme, we maintain the practicability provided by the time-bin scheme, while the quantum states are transmitted through a few-mode fiber in a configuration that does not introduce postselection losses. We experimentally demonstrate our proposal by successfully transmitting phase-encoded single-photon states for quantum cryptography over 500 m of few-mode fiber, showing the feasibility of our scheme.

TI Optimal scheduling in probabilistic imaginary-time evolution on a
   quantum computer
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Ground-state preparation is an important task in quantum computation. The probabilistic imaginary-time evolution (PITE) method is a promising candidate for preparing the ground state of the Hamiltonian, which comprises a single ancilla qubit and forward- and backward-controlled real-time evolution operators. The ground state preparation is a challenging task even in the quantum computation, classified as complexity-class quantum Merlin-Arthur. However, optimal parameters for PITE could potentially enhance the computational efficiency to a certain degree. In this paper, we analyze the computational costs of the PITE method for both linear and exponential scheduling of the imaginary-time step size for reducing the computational cost. First, we analytically discuss an error defined as the closeness between the states acted on by exact and approximate imaginary-time evolution operators. The optimal imaginary-time step size and rate of change of imaginary time are also discussed. Subsequently, the analytical discussion is validated using numerical simulations for a one-dimensional Heisenberg chain. From the results, we find that linear scheduling works well in the case of unknown eigenvalues of the Hamiltonian. For a wide range of eigenstates, the linear scheduling returns smaller errors on average. However, the linearity of the scheduling causes problems for some specific energy regions of eigenstates. To avoid these problems, incorporating a certain level of nonlinearity into the scheduling, such as by inclusion of an exponential character, is preferable for reducing the computational costs of the PITE method. The findings of this paper can make a significant contribute to the field of ground-state preparation of many-body Hamiltonians on quantum computers.

TI Twin-field quantum key distribution over a 511km optical fibre linking
   two distant metropolitan areas
SO NATURE PHOTONICS
AB The basic principle of quantum mechanics' guarantees the unconditional security of quantum key distribution (QKD)(2-6) at the cost of forbidding the amplification of a quantum state. As a result, and despite remarkable progress in world-wide metropolitan QKD networks(7,8) over the past decades, a long-haul fibre QKD network without a trusted relay has not yet been achieved. Here, through the sending-or-not-sending protocol(9), we achieve twin-field QKD(10) and distribute secure keys without any trusted repeater over a 511 km long-haul fibre trunk that links two distant metropolitan areas. The fibre trunk contains 12 fibres in the cable, three of which are used for the quantum channel, optical synchronization and frequency locking, respectively. The remaining nine are used for classical fibre communication. Our secure key rate is around three orders of magnitude greater than that expected if the previous QKD field-test system was applied over the same length. Efficient quantum-state transmission and stable single-photon interference over such a long-haul deployed fibre pave the way to large-scale fibre quantum networks.

TI Emergent Space-Time in a Bubble Universe
SO SYMMETRY-BASEL
AB I exploit the close connection between the tessellation of space-time in the Regge calculus and an Eilenberg homology to investigate the deep quantum nature of space-time in a simple bubble universe of a size consistent with the Planck regime. Following the mathematics allows me to define this granulated space-time as the embedding space of the skeleton of a computational spin network inside a quantum computer. This approach can be regarded as a quantum simulation of the equivalent physics. I can, therefore, define a fundamental characterisation of any high-energy physical process at the Planck scale as equivalent to a quantum simulation inside a quantum computer.

TI Qubit control using quantum Zeno effect: Action principle approach
SO ANNALS OF PHYSICS
AB We employ the stochastic path-integral formalism and action principle for continuous quantum measurements - the Chantasri- Dressel-Jordan (CDJ) action formalism Chantasri et al., (2013; 2015) - to understand the stages in which quantum Zeno effect helps control the states of a simple quantum system. The detailed dynamics of a driven two-level system subjected to repeated measurements unravels a myriad of phases, so to say. When the detection frequency is smaller than the Rabi frequency, the oscillations slow down, eventually coming to a halt at an interesting resonance when measurements are spaced exactly by the time of transition between the two states. On the other hand, in the limit of large number of repeated measurements, the dynamics organizes itself in a rather interesting way about two hyperbolic points in phase space whose stable and unstable directions are reversed. Thus, the phase space flow occurs from one hyperbolic point to another, in different ways organized around the separatrices. We believe that the systematic treatment presented here paves the way for a better and clearer understanding of quantum Zeno effect in the context of quantum error correction.& COPY; 2023 Elsevier Inc.

TI Benchmarking embedded chain breaking in quantum annealing
SO QUANTUM SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB Quantum annealing solves combinatorial optimization problems by finding the energetic ground states of an embedded Hamiltonian. However, quantum annealing dynamics under the embedded Hamiltonian may violate the principles of adiabatic evolution and generate excitations that correspond to errors in the computed solution. Here we empirically benchmark the probability of chain breaks and identify sweet spots for solving a suite of embedded Hamiltonian. We further correlate the physical location of chain breaks in the quantum annealing hardware with the underlying embedding technique and use these localized rates in a tailored post-processing strategies. Our results demonstrate how to use characterization of the quantum annealing hardware to tune the embedded Hamiltonian and remove computational errors.

TI Characterizing Temperature and Strain Variations with Qubit Ensembles
   for Their Robust Coherence Protection
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB Solid-state spin defects, especially nuclear spins with potentially achievable long coherence times, are compelling candidates for quantum memories and sensors. However, their current performances are still limited by dephasing due to variations of their intrinsic quadrupole and hyperfine interactions. We propose an unbalanced echo to overcome this challenge by using a second spin to refocus variations of these interactions while preserving the quantum information stored in the nuclear spin free evolution. The unbalanced echo can be used to probe the temperature and strain distribution in materials. We develop first principles methods to predict variations of these interactions and reveal their correlation over large temperature and strain ranges. Experiments performed in an ensemble of & SIM;1010 nuclear spins in diamond demonstrate a 20-fold dephasing time increase, limited by other noise sources. We further numerically show that our method can refocus even stronger noise variations than present in our experiments.

TI Quantum-resistant authentication: Securing identity and data against
   quantum threats
SO AIMS MATHEMATICS
AB Quantum computing presents a significant threat to traditional cryptographic protocols, particularly those relying on the hardness of factoring large integers and computing discrete logarithms, as quantum algorithms can solve these problems in polynomial time. With the advent of quantum computers capable of breaking current cryptographic schemes, the need for quantumresistant cryptographic mechanisms has become increasingly urgent. In this paper, we focused on authentication, a critical security property, and reviewed various classical cryptographic techniques to this aim and their potential to resist quantum attacks. We present a (non-exhaustive) overview of the state of the art in quantum-resistant authentication, particularly through symmetric cryptography, digital signatures, and hardware-based approaches such as physical unclonable functions (PUFs). By offering a clear and focused analysis, we used this survey to bridge the gap between diverse academic communities and provide a foundation for future research in post-quantum authentication.

TI Enhancing model-based acoustic localisation using quantum annealing
SO IET RADAR SONAR AND NAVIGATION
AB Model-based acoustic localisation estimates the locations of underwater objects by comparing sensor measurements with model predictions. To obtain high quality predictions, propagation models need to be run for a large set of environmental parameters. However, real-time Model-based acoustic localisation estimations using onboard computational resources are often limited. To address this, the authors propose a Quantum annealing (QA) algorithm for enhancing underwater acoustic localisation. A restricted Boltzmann machine (RBM) is trained to predict the probability distribution of underwater targets. Advantage of this approach is that part of the computation is moved to offline-training. Moreover, the probability distribution can potentially be sampled efficiently using a quantum annealer possibly enabling real-time accurate target estimations being made onboard.The RBM is applied to a simplified multi-sensor horizontal localisation problem where a constant and linear acoustic propagation is assumed. Using simulated annealing the authors show that the RBM is able to learn probability distributions that resemble target locations. Preliminary results show that training and sampling the RBM can be done using QA hardware by D-Wave Systems.However, there remains room for improvement especially in ranging predictions. Further research into possible benefits of QA RBMs is needed to provide theoretical and practical results of a speed-up.

TI Microwave-optical quantum frequency conversion
SO OPTICA
AB Photons at microwave and optical frequencies are principal carriers for quantum information. While microwave photons can be effectively controlled at the local circuit level, optical photons can propagate over long distances. High-fidelity conversion between microwave and optical photons will allow the distribution of quantum states across different quantum technology nodes and enhance the scalability of hybrid quantum systems toward a future "Quantum Internet." Despite a frequency difference of five orders of magnitude, there has been significant progress recently toward the transfer between microwave and optical photons with steadily improved efficiency in a coherent and bidirectional manner. In this review, we summarize this progress, emphasizing integrated device approaches, and provide a perspective for device implementation that enables quantum state transfer and entanglement distribution across microwave and optical domains.

We report a tabletop entanglement-based interferometric imaging technique that utilizes two entangled field modes serving as a phase reference between two apertures. The spatial distribution of a simulated thermal light source is determined by interfering light collected at each aperture with one of the entangled fields and performing joint measurements. This experiment demonstrates the ability of entanglement to implement interferometric imaging.

TI Quantifying entanglement for unknown quantum states via artificial
   neural networks
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB Quantum entanglement acts as a crucial part in quantum computation and quantum information, hence quantifying unknown entanglement is an important task. Due to the fact that the amount of entanglement cannot be achieved directly by measuring any physical observables, it remains an open problem to quantify entanglement experimentally. In this work, we provide an effective way to quantify entanglement for the unknown quantum states via artificial neural networks. By choosing the expectation values of measurements as input features and the values of entanglement measures as labels, we train artificial neural network models to predict the entanglement for new quantum states accurately. Our method does not require the full information about unknown quantum states, which highlights the effectiveness and versatility of machine learning in exploring quantum entanglement.

TI Millimeter-Waves to Terahertz SISO and MIMO Continuous Variable Quantum
   Key Distribution
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON QUANTUM ENGINEERING
AB With the exponentially increased demands for large bandwidth, it is important to think about the best network platform as well as the security and privacy of the information in communication networks. Millimeter (mm)-waves and terahertz (THz) with high carrier frequencies are proposed as the enabling technologies to overcome Shannon's channel capacity limit of existing communication systems by providing ultrawide bandwidth signals. Mm-waves and THz are also able to build wireless links compatible with optical communication systems. However, most solid-state components that can operate reasonably efficiently at these frequency ranges (100 GHz-10 THz), especially sources and detectors, require cryogenic cooling, as is a requirement for most quantum systems. Here, we show that secure mm-waves and THz quantum key distribution (QKD) can be achieved when the sources and detectors operate at cryogenic temperatures down to T = 4 K. We compare single-input single-output and multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) continuous variable THz quantum key distribution (CVQKD) schemes and find the positive secret key rate in the frequency ranges between f = 100 GHz and 1 THz. Moreover, we find that the maximum transmission distance could be extended, the secret key rate could be improved in lower temperatures, and achieve a maximum secret communication distance of more than 5 km at f = 100 GHz and T = 4 K by using 1024 x 1024 antennas. Our results for the first time show the possibility of mm-waves and THz MIMO CVQKD with the system operating at temperatures below T = 50 K, which may contribute to the efforts to develop next-generation secure wireless communication systems and quantum internet for applications from intersatellite and deep space to indoor and short-distance communications.

TI Optimized Compiler for Distributed Quantum Computing
SO ACM TRANSACTIONS ON QUANTUM COMPUTING
AB Practical distributed quantum computing requires the development of efficient compilers, able to make quantum circuits compatible with some given hardware constraints. This problem is known to be tough, even for local computing. Here, we address it on distributed architectures. As generally assumed in this scenario, telegates represent the fundamental remote (inter-processor) operations. Each telegate consists of several tasks: (i) entanglement generation and distribution, (ii) local operations, and (iii) classical communications. Entanglement generations and distribution is an expensive resource, as it is time-consuming. To mitigate its impact, we model an optimization problem that combines running-time minimization with the usage of distributed entangled states. Specifically, we formulated the distributed compilation problem as a dynamic network flow. To enhance the solution space, we extend the formulation, by introducing a predicate that manipulates the circuit given in input and parallelizes telegate tasks.
   To evaluate our framework, we split the problem into three sub-problems, and solve it by means of an approximation routine. Experiments demonstrate that the run-time is resistant to the problem size scaling. Moreover, we apply the proposed algorithm to compile circuits under different topologies, showing that topologies with a higher ratio between edges and nodes give rise to shallower circuits.

TI Measurement-device-independent continuous variable entanglement witness
   in a quantum network
SO LIGHT-SCIENCE & APPLICATIONS
AB The reliable detection of entanglement plays a crucial role in the construction of quantum networks. The conventional entanglement witness (EW) method has high requirements for measurement device and relies on reliable implementation of the measurement. With unreliable measurement device, EW process can be easily attacked by eavesdroppers, which can lead to incorrect entanglement detection results. Therefore, a feasible and secure measurement device independent entanglement witness (MDIEW) method is desired for constructing quantum networks. Here, we detect the continuous variable entanglement by a MDIEW in a quantum network. It is demonstrated that the conventional EW method can be affected when the local oscillator intensity is changed, while the MDIEW method can detect entanglement between users without being affected. Our results provide a trustworthy method to detect entanglement, which is an important step for constructing secure quantum networks.

TI Quantum Circuits with Classical Versus Quantum Control of Causal Order
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB Quantum supermaps are transformations that map quantum operations to quantum operations. It is known that quantum supermaps which respect a definite, predefined causal order between their input operations correspond to fixed-order quantum circuits, also called quantum combs. A systematic understanding of the physical interpretation of more general types of quantum supermaps-in particular, those incompatible with a definite causal structure-is however lacking. In this paper, we identify two types of circuits that naturally generalize the fixed-order case and that likewise correspond to distinct classes of quantum supermaps, which we fully characterize. We first introduce "quantum circuits with classical control of causal order," in which the order of operations is still well defined, but not necessarily fixed in advance: it can, in particular, be established dynamically, in a classically controlled manner, as the circuit is being used. We then consider "quantum circuits with quantum control of causal order," in which the order of operations is controlled coherently. The supermaps described by these classes of circuits are physically realizable, and the latter encompasses all known examples of physically realizable processes with indefinite causal order, including the celebrated "quantum switch." Interestingly, it also contains other examples arising from the combination of dynamical and coherent control of causal order, and we detail explicitly one such process. Nevertheless, we show that quantum circuits with quantum control of causal order can only generate "causal" correlations, compatible with a well-defined causal order. We furthermore extend our considerations to probabilistic circuits that produce also classical outcomes, and we demonstrate by an example how the characterizations derived in this work allow us to identify advantages for quantum information processing tasks that could be demonstrated in practice.

TI Preparing the Gutzwiller wave function for attractive SU(3) fermions on
   a quantum computer
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB We implement the Gutzwiller wave function for attractive SU(3) fermion systems on a quantum computer using a quantum-classical hybrid scheme based on the discrete Hubbard-Stratonovich transformation. In this approach, the nonunitary Gutzwiller operator is decomposed into a linear combination of unitaries constructed from two-qubit fermionic Givens-rotation gates, whose rotation angles are dictated by the auxiliary fields. We develop and reformulate two complementary methods to perform the sum over these auxiliary fields. In the first method, the Gutzwiller wave function is probabilistically prepared on the register qubits by projectively postselecting the desired state via measurements of ancilla qubits. We analyze the success rate both analytically and numerically as a function of the Gutzwiller variational parameter g for the Fermi-sea and BCS-like trial states at half filling. The success rate is found to decay exponentially for small |g|, but remains finite in the |g| -> infinity limit, with increasing |g|. In the second method, we employ importance sampling to address the Gutzwiller variational problem, where the central objective is to estimate the expectation values of observables. We demonstrate the proposed scheme by calculating the energy and triple occupancy of the attractive SU(3) Hubbard model in the framework of digital quantum simulation. Moreover, we present experimental results obtained on a trapped-ion quantum computer for the two-site attractive SU(3) Hubbard model, showing good agreement with exact values within statistical errors.

TI Nonclassical correlations in subsystems of globally entangled quantum
   states
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB The relation between genuine multipartite entanglement in the pure state of a collection of N qubits and the nonclassical correlations in its two-qubit subsystems is studied. Quantum discord is used as the quantifier of nonclassical correlations in the subsystem while the generalized geometric measure [A. Sen(De) and U. Sen, Phys. Rev. A 81, 012308 (2010)] is used to quantify global entanglement in the N-qubit state. While no definite discernible dependence between the two can be found for randomly generated global states, for those with additional structure like weighted graph states we find that local discord is indicative of global multipartite entanglement. Global states that admit efficient classical descriptions like stabilizer states furnish an exception in which, despite multipartite entanglement, nonclassical correlation is absent in two-qubit subsystems. We discuss these results in the context of mixed state quantum computation where nonclassical correlation is considered a candidate resource that enables exponential speedup over classical computers.

TI Demonstrating Bayesian quantum phase estimation with quantum error
   detection
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Quantum phase estimation (QPE) serves as a building block of many different quantum algorithms and finds important applications in computational chemistry problems. Despite the rapid development of quantum hardware, experimental demonstration of QPE for chemistry problems remains challenging due to its large circuit depth and the lack of quantum resources to protect the hardware from noise with fully fault-tolerant protocols. In the present work, we take a step towards fault-tolerant quantum computing by demonstrating a QPE algorithm on a Quantinuum trapped-ion computer. We employ a Bayesian approach to QPE and introduce a routine for optimal parameter selection, which we combine with a Qn + 2, n, 21 quantum error detection code carefully tailored to the hardware capabilities. As a simple quantum chemistry example, we take a hydrogen molecule represented by a two-qubit Hamiltonian and estimate its ground state energy using our QPE protocol. In the experiment, we use the quantum circuits containing as many as 920 physical two-qubit gates to estimate the ground state energy within 6x10-3 hartree of the exact value.

Schrodinger's famous cat brought quantum science to the public consciousness, while Deutsch's thought experiment to test the many-worlds and Copenhagen interpretations involved the first conception of a quantum computer. I will show how presenting thought experiments using quantum circuits can demystify apparent quantum paradoxes, and provide fun, conceptually important activities for learners to implement themselves on near-term quantum devices. Additionally, I will explain how thought experiments can be used as a first introduction to quantum, and outline a workshop based on the "quantum bomb tester" for school students as young as 11. This paper draws upon my experience in developing and delivering quantum computing workshops in Oxford, and in creating a quantum paradoxes content series with IBM Quantum of videos, blogs and code tutorials.

TI No Sum (NS) Sequence: A Tool for Quantum-Safe Cryptography
SO CONTEMPORARY MATHEMATICS
AB Quantum computing is emerging as a promising technology that can solve the world's most complex and computationally intensive problems, including cryptography. Conventional cryptography is now facing a severe threat because of the speed of computation offered by quantum computers. There is a need for the standardization of novel quantum-resistant public-key cryptographic algorithms. In this article, the No-Sum (NS) sequence-based public key cryptosystem is proposed, increasing the computational resource requirement against the quantum computer-assisted bruteforce attack. In this paper, we demonstrate an elevation of security of the public key cryptosystem with NS sequence. The proposed methodology works in two phases; in the first phase, the conventional RSA algorithm is used to share the first element and offset parameter between the receiver and sender. In the second phase, prime numbers are generated from the NS sequence and used for encryption/ decryption of messages/ciphers. This paper illustrates the potential of the NS sequence in developing a quantum-resistant cryptosystem, contributing to the advancement of secure communication in the quantum computing era.

TI Millisecond Coherence in a Superconducting Qubit
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB Improving control over physical qubits is a crucial component of quantum computing research. Here we report a superconducting fluxonium qubit with uncorrected coherence time T-2* = 1.48 +/- 0.13 ms, exceeding the state of the art for transmons by an order of magnitude. The average gate fidelity was benchmarked at 0.99991(1). Notably, even in the millisecond range, the coherence time is limited by material absorption and could be further improved with a more rigorous fabrication. Our demonstration may be useful for suppressing errors in the next generation quantum processors.

TI Experimental QND measurements of complementarity on two-qubit states
   with IonQ and IBM Q quantum computers

AB We report the experimental nondemolition measurement of coherence, predictability and concurrence on a system of two qubits. The quantum circuits proposed by De Melo et al. (Phys Rev Lett 98(25):250501, 2007) are implemented on IBM Q (superconducting circuit) and IonQ (trapped ion) quantum computers. Three criteria are used to compare the performance of the different machines on this task: measurement accuracy, nondemolition of the observable, and quantum state preparation. We find that the IonQ quantum computer provides constant state fidelity through the nondemolition process, outperforming IBM Q systems on which the fidelity consequently drops after the measurement. Our study compares the current performance of these two technologies at different stages of the nondemolition measurement of bipartite complementarity.

In this work, we theoretically demonstrate that the robust quantum entanglement provides regulatory benefits to the charge-transport via a quantum heat engine model with two absorbed photon channels. The calculation results manifest that the dynamic charge-transport and the steady-state photosynthetic properties of the PSII RC were enhanced by the intensity of quantum entanglement. Insight into the role of quantum entanglement in photosynthesis could motivate new experimental strategies for biomimetic photosynthetic devices in the future.

TI Can quantum computing surpass classical algorithms in optimizing
   building performance? A benchmark study with 15,000 simulations
SO ENERGY AND BUILDINGS
AB Optimizing building performance is essential for enhancing energy efficiency and occupant comfort. This study evaluates the applicability of quantum computing-based optimization methods in the Architecture, Engineering, and Construction (AEC) industry by comparing the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) and Quantum Annealing (QA) with classical multi-objective optimization algorithms, namely Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm II (NSGA-II) and Multi-Objective Particle Swarm Optimization (MOPSO). A dataset of 15,000 building simulations was used to train an Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) model for predicting total energy consumption (kWh/m2/year) and Predicted Percentage of Dissatisfied (PPD) occupants. These predictions were then used in the optimization phase. NSGA-II produced the best trade-offs, achieving energy consumption between 17.84 and 19.84 kWh/m2/year and PPD below 5.2 %, with strong diversity and convergence. QAOA executed faster (0.54 min) than NSGA-II (18.9 min) but resulted in higher energy values (31.85-55.62 kWh/m2/ year) and weaker solution quality. Quantum Annealing completed in 0.37 min but returned clustered solutions near 45.88 kWh/m2/year. While the current limitations of quantum methods constrain their effectiveness, the findings indicate their potential as fast solvers in future building performance optimization workflows, particularly as hardware and algorithmic capabilities mature.

TI Quantum annealing for combinatorial optimization: a benchmarking study
SO NPJ QUANTUM INFORMATION
AB Quantum annealing (QA) has the potential to significantly improve solution quality and reduce time complexity in solving combinatorial optimization problems compared to classical optimization methods. However, due to the limited number of qubits and their connectivity, the QA hardware did not show such an advantage over classical methods in past benchmarking studies. Recent advancements in QA with more than 5000 qubits, enhanced qubit connectivity, and the hybrid architecture promise to realize the quantum advantage. Here, we use a quantum annealer with state-of-the-art techniques and benchmark its performance against classical solvers. To compare their performance, we solve over 50 optimization problem instances represented by large and dense Hamiltonian matrices using quantum and classical solvers. The results demonstrate that a state-of-the-art quantum solver has higher accuracy (similar to 0.013%) and a significantly faster problem-solving time (similar to 6561x) than the best classical solver. Our results highlight the advantages of leveraging QA over classical counterparts, particularly in hybrid configurations, for achieving high accuracy and substantially reduced problem solving time in large-scale real-world optimization problems.

TI Optimized Unconventional Geometric Gates in Superconducting Circuits
SO APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL
AB Nonadiabatic Abelian geometric quantum computation has been extensively studied, due to its fast manipulation and inherent noise resistance. However, to obtain the pure geometric phase, the quantum state is required to evolve along some special paths to eliminate the dynamical phase. This leads to increasing evolution time and weakened gate robustness. The unconventional geometric quantum computation is an effective way to solve the above problems. Here, we propose a general approach to realize the unconventional geometric computation. Then, we discuss the effect of the ratio of geometric phase to dynamic phase on the performance of quantum gates. The results show that the selection of ratio corresponds to different quantum gate robustness. Therefore, we can optimize the ratio to get higher-fidelity quantum gates. At last, we construct the ratio-optimized quantum gates in a superconducting circuit and test its robustness. The fidelities of the T-gate, Hadamard H-gate, and controlled phase gate can be obtained as 99.98%, 99.95%, and 99.85%, respectively. Therefore, our scheme provides a promising way to realize large-scale fault-tolerant quantum computation in superconducting circuits.

TI High-Accuracy Entanglement Detection via a Convolutional Neural Network
   with Noise Resistance
SO APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL
AB Quantum entanglement detection is one of the fundamental tasks in quantum information science. Conventional methods for quantum state tomography exhibit limitations in scalability as the number of qubits increases, leading to exponential growth in the number of unknown parameters and required measurements. Consequently, the accuracy enhancement achieved by these methods is constrained. In response to this challenge, we developed a tailored convolutional neural network (CNN) model capable of effectively detecting entanglement in two-qubit quantum states, achieving an accuracy exceeding 97.5%. Notably, even in the presence of noise, this model retains its robust performance, displaying resilience against a tolerable level of noise contamination. Furthermore, the inherent generalization power of CNNs allows our model, which was initially trained on a specific spectrum of quantum states, to extend its applicability to wider states, positioning it as an outstanding tool for the further application of machine learning in the field of quantum computing, opening up new pathways for solving entanglement detection problems in quantum information.

TI Electron wave-spin qubit
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICS COMMUNICATIONS
AB As a continuation of our earlier investigations into electron wave-spin, we analyze the electron spin and its qubit in a cavity by treating the electron as a physical wave obeying the Dirac equation. In this view, a qubit is a current-density configuration whose orientation is fixed by the relative phase, rather than a particle carrying simultaneous 'up' and 'down' spin states with assigned probabilities. The resulting magnetic-moment density, derived from the current, displays a richer vector distribution and topology than the fixed axial dipole weighted by probability density in the conventional wave-particle model. Both frameworks yield the same total moment of one Bohr magneton and are indistinguishable in uniform external fields, yet their ontological differences predict distinct couplings to structured fields and spin-spin interactions. These contrasts motivate further exploration of dynamical consequences within the wave-entity framework, including Aharonov-Bohm-like responses that provide testable alternatives to conventional wave-particle duality.

TI Quantum state discrimination in a PT-symmetric system
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Nonorthogonal quantum state discrimination (QSD) plays an important role in quantum information and quantum communication. In addition, compared to Hermitian quantum systems, parity-time-(PT-)symmetric non-Hermitian quantum systems exhibit novel phenomena and have attracted considerable attention. Here, we experimentally demonstrate QSD in a PT-symmetric system (i.e., PT-symmetric QSD), by having quantum states evolve under a PT-symmetric Hamiltonian in a lossy linear optical setup. We observe that two initially nonorthogonal states can rapidly evolve into orthogonal states and the required evolution time can even be vanishing provided the matrix elements of the Hamiltonian become sufficiently large. We also observe that the cost of such a discrimination is a dissipation of quantum states into the environment. Furthermore, by comparing PT-symmetric QSD with optimal strategies in Hermitian systems, we find that at the critical value, PT-symmetric QSD is equivalent to the optimal unambiguous state discrimination in Hermitian systems. We also extend the PT-symmetric QSD to the case of discriminating three nonorthogonal states. The QSD in a PT-symmetric system opens a new door for quantum state discrimination, which has important applications in quantum computing, quantum cryptography, and quantum communication.

TI Generation and Structuring of Multipartite Entanglement in a Josephson
   Parametric System
SO ADVANCED QUANTUM TECHNOLOGIES
AB Quantum correlations are a vital resource in advanced information processing based on quantum phenomena. Remarkably, the vacuum state of a quantum field may act as a key element for the generation of multipartite quantum entanglement. In this work, generation of genuine tripartite entangled state and its control is achieved by the use of the phase difference between two continuous pump tones. Control of the subspaces of the covariance matrix for tripartite bisqueezed state is demonstrated. Furthermore, by optimizing the phase relationships in a three-tone pumping scheme genuine quadripartite entanglement of a generalized H-graph state (H similar to$\mathcal {\tilde{H}}$-graph) is explored. This scheme provides a comprehensive control toolbox for the entanglement structure and allows to demonstrate, for first time to the authors' knowledge, genuine quadripartite entanglement of microwave modes. All experimental results are verified with numerical simulations of the nonlinear quantum Langevin equation. It is envisioned that quantum resources facilitated by multi-pump configurations offer enhanced prospects for quantum data processing using parametric microwave cavities.

TI Electromagnetically-induced transparency assists the Raman gradient echo
   memory at moderate detuning, dependent on gradient order
SO NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB Optical quantum memories are essential for quantum communications and photonic quantum technologies. Ensemble optical memories based on 3-level interactions are a popular basis for implementing these memories. All such memories, however, suffer from loss due to scattering. In off-resonant 3-level interactions, such as the Raman gradient echo memory (GEM), scattering loss can be reduced by a large detuning from the intermediate state. In this work, we show how electromagnetically induced transparency adjacent to the Raman absorption line plays a crucial role in reducing scattering loss, so that maximum efficiency is in fact achieved at a moderate detuning. Furthermore, the effectiveness of the transparency, and therefore the efficiency of GEM, depends on the order in which gradients are applied to store and recall the light. We provide a theoretical analysis and show experimentally how the efficiency depends on gradient order and detuning.

TI Phase Noise in Real-World Twin-Field Quantum Key Distribution
SO ADVANCED QUANTUM TECHNOLOGIES
AB The impact of noise sources in real-world implementations of twin-field quantum key distribution (TF-QKD) protocols is investigated, focusing on phase noise from photon sources and connecting fibers. This work emphasizes the role of laser quality, network topology, fiber length, arm balance, and detector performance in determining key rates. Remarkably, it reveals that the leading TF-QKD protocols are similarly affected by phase noise despite different mechanisms. This study demonstrates duty cycle improvements of over a factor of two through narrow-linewidth lasers and phase-control techniques, highlighting the potential synergy with high-precision time and frequency distribution services. Ultrastable lasers, evolving toward integration and miniaturization, offer promising solutions for agile TF-QKD implementations on existing networks. Properly addressing phase noise and practical constraints allows for consistent key rate predictions, protocol selection, and layout design, crucial for establishing secure long-haul links for the quantum communication infrastructures under development in several countries.
   This study explores the impact of various noise sources on twin-field quantum key distribution (TF-QKD) systems, focusing on phase noise from photon sources and fibers.

AB Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum Computing (NISQ) has dominated headlines in recent years, with the longer-term vision of Fault-Tolerant Quantum Computation (FTQC) offering significant potential albeit at currently intractable resource costs and quantum error correction (QEC) overheads. For problems of interest, FTQC will require millions of physical qubits with long coherence times, high-fidelity gates, and compact sizes to surpass classical systems. Just as heterogeneous specialization has offered scaling benefits in classical computing, it is likewise gaining interest in FTQC. However, systematic use of heterogeneity in either hardware or software elements of FTQC systems remains a serious challenge due to the vast design space and variable physical constraints.
   This paper meets the challenge of making heterogeneous FTQC design practical by introducing HetArch, a toolbox for designing heterogeneous quantum systems, and using it to explore heterogeneous design scenarios. Using a hierarchical approach, we successively break quantum algorithms into smaller operations (akin to classical application kernels), thus greatly simplifying the design space and resulting tradeoffs. Specializing to superconducting systems, we then design optimized heterogeneous hardware composed of varied superconducting devices, abstracting physical constraints into design rules that enable devices to be assembled into standard cells optimized for specific operations. Finally, we provide a heterogeneous design space exploration framework which reduces the simulation burden by a factor of 10(4) or more and allows us to characterize optimal design points. We use these techniques to design superconducting quantum modules for entanglement distillation, error correction, and code teleportation, reducing error rates by 2.6x, 10.7x, and 3.0x compared to homogeneous systems.

TI Parallel quantum annealing
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB Quantum annealers of D-Wave Systems, Inc., offer an efficient way to compute high quality solutions of NP-hard problems. This is done by mapping a problem onto the physical qubits of the quantum chip, from which a solution is obtained after quantum annealing. However, since the connectivity of the physical qubits on the chip is limited, a minor embedding of the problem structure onto the chip is required. In this process, and especially for smaller problems, many qubits will stay unused. We propose a novel method, called parallel quantum annealing, to make better use of available qubits, wherein either the same or several independent problems are solved in the same annealing cycle of a quantum annealer, assuming enough physical qubits are available to embed more than one problem. Although the individual solution quality may be slightly decreased when solving several problems in parallel (as opposed to solving each problem separately), we demonstrate that our method may give dramatic speed-ups in terms of the Time-To-Solution (TTS) metric for solving instances of the Maximum Clique problem when compared to solving each problem sequentially on the quantum annealer. Additionally, we show that solving a single Maximum Clique problem using parallel quantum annealing reduces the TTS significantly.

TI Cutoff phenomenon and entropic uncertainty for random quantum circuits
SO ELECTRONIC STRUCTURE
AB How fast a state of a system converges to a stationary state is one of the fundamental questions in science. Some Markov chains and random walks on finite groups are known to exhibit the non-asymptotic convergence to a stationary distribution, called the cutoff phenomenon. Here, we examine how quickly a random quantum circuit could transform a quantum state to a Haar-measure random quantum state. We find that random quantum states, as stationary states of random walks on a unitary group, are invariant under the quantum Fourier transform (QFT). Thus the entropic uncertainty of random quantum states has balanced Shannon entropies for the computational basis and the QFT basis. By calculating the Shannon entropy for random quantum states and the Wasserstein distances for the eigenvalues of random quantum circuits, we show that the cutoff phenomenon occurs for the random quantum circuit. It is also demonstrated that the Dyson-Brownian motion for the eigenvalues of a random unitary matrix as a continuous random walk exhibits the cutoff phenomenon. The results here imply that random quantum states could be generated with shallow random circuits.

TI Dual-Element, Two-Dimensional Atom Array with Continuous-Mode Operation
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW X
AB Quantum processing architectures that include multiple qubit modalities offer compelling strategies for high-fidelity operations and readout, quantum error correction, and a path for scaling to large system sizes. Such hybrid architectures have been realized for leading platforms, including superconducting circuits and trapped ions. Recently, a new approach for constructing large, coherent quantum processors has emerged based on arrays of individually trapped neutral atoms. However, these demonstrations have been limited to arrays of a single atomic element where the identical nature of the atoms makes crosstalk-free control and nondemolition readout of a large number of atomic qubits challenging. Here we introduce a dual-element atom array with individual control of single rubidium and cesium atoms. We demonstrate their independent placement in arrays with up to 512 trapping sites and observe negligible crosstalk between the two elements. Furthermore, by continuously reloading one atomic element while maintaining an array of the other, we demonstrate a new continuous operation mode for atom arrays without any off-time. Our results enable avenues for auxiliary-qubit-assisted quantum protocols such as quantum nondemolition measurements and quantum error correction, as well as continuously operating quantum processors and sensors.

TI Enhancement of Nonreciprocal Entanglement and Transmission via
   Phase-Dependent Unidirectional Coupling
SO ADVANCED QUANTUM TECHNOLOGIES
AB The nonreciprocal property of quantum systems is crucial for chiral quantum networks. In this study, a phase-controlled scheme is proposed to enhance the nonreciprocal quantum entanglement and optical transmission in a cavity optomechanical system by introducing a phase-dependent unidirectional coupling between two whispering-gallery-mode (WGM) resonators. The Sagnac effect induced by the spinning resonator generates nonreciprocity, while the interference effect between direct evanescent coupling and indirect phase-dependent unidirectional coupling significantly enhances entanglement under the anti-Stokes sideband. For specific coupling phases, ideal nonreciprocity can be achieved in both entanglement and transmission. The proposed phase-controlled nonreciprocity presented offers an effective strategy for constructing a unidirectional quantum channel and implementing an optical diode in chiral quantum networks, thereby opening up new possibilities for applications in quantum technologies.

AB Quantum signal processing (QSP), which is a general technique for construction of 1-qubit rotation operators, is a strong framework for quantum algorithm design. We consider a scenario of information-theoretically secure computation for QSP: n parties who have private angle parameters make the evaluator perform the QSP from the sum of their angles in a privacy-preserving manner through noninteractive communication. In this scenario, we construct a private simultaneous messages (PSM) protocol for QSP, named Private QSP (PQSP). As an application, we construct an efficient PSM protocol for symmetric Boolean functions with an evaluator of 1-qubit workspace by adapting PQSP to the 1-qubit quantum algorithm for symmetric Boolean functions of Maslov et al. [1]. We also show that the technique of PQSP works for the 1-qubit program for Boolean functions of Cosentino et al. [2]. We construct an efficient PSM protocol for Boolean functions computable by O(log n)-depth circuits with an evaluator of 1-qubit writable workspace from their 1-qubit program [3]. Such efficient PSM protocols with space-bounded classical evaluators have not been known so far.

TI Efficient Measure for the Expressivity of Variational Quantum Algorithms
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB The superiority of variational quantum algorithms (VQAs) such as quantum neural networks (QNNs) and variational quantum eigensolvers (VQEs) heavily depends on the expressivity of the employed Ansatze. Namely, a simple Ansatz is insufficient to capture the optimal solution, while an intricate Ansatz leads to the hardness of trainability. Despite its fundamental importance, an effective strategy of measuring the expressivity of VQAs remains largely unknown. Here, we exploit an advanced tool in statistical learning theory, i.e., covering number, to study the expressivity of VQAs. Particularly, we first exhibit how the expressivity of VQAs with an arbitrary Ansatze is upper bounded by the number of quantum gates and the measurement observable. We next explore the expressivity of VQAs on near-term quantum chips, where the system noise is considered. We observe an exponential decay of the expressivity with increasing circuit depth. We also utilize the achieved expressivity to analyze the generalization of QNNs and the accuracy of VQE. We numerically verify our theory employing VQAs with different levels of expressivity. Our Letter opens the avenue for quantitative understanding of the expressivity of VQAs.

TI Integrated preparation and manipulation of high-dimensional flying
   structured photons
SO ELIGHT
AB The hope for a futuristic global quantum internet that provides robust and high-capacity quantum information transfer lies largely on qudits, the fundamental quantum information carriers prepared in high-dimensional superposition states. However, preparing and manipulating N-dimensional flying qudits as well as subsequently establishing their entanglement are still challenging tasks, which require precise and simultaneous maneuver of 2 (N-1) parameters across multiple degrees of freedom. Here, using an integrated approach, we explore the synergy from two degrees of freedom of light, spatial mode and polarization, to generate, encode, and manipulate flying structured photons and their formed qudits in a four-dimensional Hilbert space with high quantum fidelity, intrinsically enabling enhanced noise resilience and higher quantum data rates. The four eigen spin-orbit modes of our qudits possess identical spatial-temporal characteristics in terms of intensity distribution and group velocity, thereby preserving long-haul coherence within the entirety of the quantum data transmission link. Judiciously leveraging the bi-photon entanglement, which is well preserved in the integrated manipulation process, we present versatile spin-orbit cluster states in an extensive dimensional Hilbert space. Such cluster states hold the promise for quantum error correction which can further bolster the channel robustness in long-range quantum communication.

AB In recent years, researchers have oriented their studies towards new technologies based on quantum physics that should resolve complex problems currently considered to be intractable. This new research area is called Quantum Computing. What makes Quantum Computing so attractive is the particular way with which quantum technology operates and the great potential it can offer to solve real-world problems. This work focuses on solving assignment-like combinatorial optimization problems by exploiting this novel computational approach. A case-study, denoted as the Seating Arrangement Optimization problem, is considered. It is modeled through the Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization paradigm and solved through two tools made available by the D-Wave Systems company, QBSolv, and a quantum-classical hybrid system. The obtained experimental results are compared in terms of solution quality and computational efficiency.

TI High-Dimensional Entanglement for Quantum Communication in the Frequency
   Domain
SO LASER & PHOTONICS REVIEWS
AB High-dimensional photonic entanglement is a promising candidate for error-protected quantum information processing with improved capacity. Encoding high-dimensional qudits in the carrier frequency of photons combines ease of generation, universal single-photon gates, and compatibility with fiber transmission for high-capacity quantum communication. Recent landmark experiments have impressively demonstrated quantum interference of a few frequency modes, yet the certification of massive-dimensional frequency entanglement has remained an open challenge. This study shows how to harness the large frequency-entanglement inherent in standard continuous-wave spontaneous parametric down-conversion processes. It further reports a record certification of discretized frequency entanglement, combined with a novel approach for certification that is both highly efficient and nonlocally implementable. This technique requires very few measurements and does not require assumptions on the state. The work opens the possibility for utilizing this encoding in quantum communications and in quantum information science in general.

TI Experimental Quantum Embedding for Machine Learning
SO ADVANCED QUANTUM TECHNOLOGIES
AB The classification of big data usually requires a mapping onto new data clusters which can then be processed by machine learning algorithms by means of more efficient and feasible linear separators. Recently, Lloyd et al. have advanced the proposal to embed classical data into quantum ones: these live in the more complex Hilbert space where they can get split into linearly separable clusters. Here, these ideas are implemented by engineering two different experimental platforms, based on quantum optics and ultra-cold atoms, respectively, where we adapt and numerically optimize the quantum embedding protocol by deep learning methods, and test it for some trial classical data. A similar analysis is also performed on the Rigetti superconducting quantum computer. Therefore, it is found that the quantum embedding approach successfully works also at the experimental level and, in particular, we show how different platforms could work in a complementary fashion to achieve this task. These studies might pave the way for future investigations on quantum machine learning techniques especially based on hybrid quantum technologies.

TI Quantum Key Distribution Applicability to Smart Grid Cybersecurity
   Systems
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB To meet the increasing demand for electricity and to have a more reliable and resilient electric grid against conventional and extreme events, grid modernization is more crucial now than ever before. This will require the development and deployment of devices that provide advanced communication capabilities. The overall efficiency, reliability, and resilience of the smart grid will be inextricably linked to the exchange of information between these devices. Unfortunately, the increased information flow will increase the potential attack surface and introduce new vulnerabilities. While a smarter grid will depend critically on information flow, these benefits will be accrued only if that information can be protected. Nowadays, information is secured in smart grids primarily through cryptography. However, with the increasing number of sophisticated attacks as well as the increasing computational power, the security of the "classical" cryptographic algorithms is threatened. Quantum information science offers solutions to this problem, specifically quantum key distribution (QKD), which provides a means for the generation and secure distribution of symmetric cryptographic keys. The security of QKD stems ultimately from the very nature of quantum physics. In this paper, we investigate the applicability of QKD to the various smart grid sectors and specific use cases. We have identified 18 smart grid use cases of interest for QKD suitability together with 7 QKD factors used for the assessment of the various use cases. For each use case, the impact to security of the loss of confidentiality, integrity, and/or availability is specified. In addition, the suitability of QKD is assessed for each use case with respect to multiple factors.

TI Calibration of syndrome measurements in a single experiment
SO NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB Quantum error correction can reduce the effects of noise in quantum systems, e.g. in metrology or most notably in quantum computing. Typically, this requires making measurements that provide information about the errors that have occurred in the system. However, these syndrome measurements themselves introduce noise into the system, for example by using noisy gates. A complete characterization of the measurements is very costly. Here we describe a calibration method to obtain the syndrome statistics taking into account the additional noise sources. All calibration data are extracted from a single experiment in which the syndrome measurement is performed twice in a row. Thus, our method allows an accurate evaluation of syndrome measurements with significantly less effort than existing methods. We give examples of the application of this method to noise estimation and error correction. Finally, we discuss the results of experiments performed on an IBM quantum computer.

AB Near-term quantum computing (QC) systems have limited qubit counts, high gate (instruction) error rates, and typically support a minimal instruction set having one type of two-qubit gate (2Q). To reduce program instruction counts and improve application expressivity, vendors have proposed, and shown proof-of-concept demonstrations of richer instruction sets such as XY gates (Rigetti) and fSim gates (Google). These instruction sets comprise of families of 2Q gate types parameterized by continuous qubit rotation angles. That is, it allows a large set of different physical operations to be realized on the qubits, based on the input angles. However, having such a large number of gate types is problematic because each gate type has to be calibrated periodically, across the full system, to obtain high fidelity implementations. This results in substantial recurring calibration overheads even on current systems which use only a few gate types. Our work aims to navigate this tradeoff between application expressivity and calibration overhead, and identify what instructions vendors should implement to get the best expressivity with acceptable calibration time.
   Studying this tradeoff is challenging because of the diversity in QC application requirements, the need to optimize applications for widely different hardware gate types and noise variations across gate types. Therefore, our work develops NuOp, a flexible compilation pass based on numerical optimization, to efficiently decompose application operations into arbitrary hardware gate types. Using NuOp and four important quantum applications, we study the instruction set proposals of Rigetti and Google, with realistic noise simulations and a calibration model. Our experiments show that implementing 4-8 types of 2Q gates is sufficient to attain nearly the same expressivity as a full continuous gate family, while reducing the calibration overhead by two orders of magnitude. With several vendors proposing rich gate families as means to higher fidelity, our work has potential to provide valuable instruction set design guidance for near-term QC systems.

TI Loss-tolerant prepare and measure quantum key distribution protocol
SO SCIENTIFIC AFRICAN
AB We propose a modified version of the Bennett-Brassard 1984 quantum key distribution protocol intended to tolerate losses, certain forms of noise, and the so-called photon-number splitting attack. These are the issues facing the realization of practical quantum key distribution. The modified protocol is based on quantum non-demolition measurements for systems using weak coherent pulses. Our scheme ensures that emissions corresponding to zero photon pulses, multi-photon pulses, and detector double-clicks are discarded before sifting to improve sifting efficiency and increase the secret key rate. Moreover, we perform the finite key analysis to obtain the maximal achievable secret-key fraction and the corresponding optimal number of signals. Also, we compare our proposed protocol to the decoy-state quantum key distribution protocol. We observe that our proposed quantum key distribution scheme enables a more extended transmission distance than the decoy-state quantum key distribution protocol. Thus, this an advance in quantum communication because current limitations on quantum key distribution involve transmitting secret keys over more considerable distances in the presence of noise or losses in optical fibres.

TI Authentication of variable length messages in quantum key distribution
SO EPJ QUANTUM TECHNOLOGY
AB Authentication plays a critical role in the security of quantum key distribution (QKD) protocols. We propose using Polynomial Hash and its variants for authentication of variable length messages in QKD protocols. Since universal hashing is used not only for authentication in QKD but also in other steps in QKD like error correction and privacy amplification, and also in several other areas of quantum cryptography, Polynomial Hash and its variants as the most efficient universal hash function families can be used in these important steps and areas, as well. We introduce and analyze several efficient variants of Polynomial Hash and, using deep results from number theory, prove that each variant gives an epsilon-almost-Delta-universal family of hash functions. We also give a general method for transforming any such family to an s-almost-strongly universal family of hash functions. The latter families can then, among other applications, be used in the Wegman-Carter MAC construction which has been shown to provide a universally composable authentication method in QKD protocols. As Polynomial Hash has found many applications, our constructions and results are potentially of interest in various areas.

TI Variational quantum algorithm for low-dimensional systems in the Pauli
   basis
SO PHYSICAL AND CHEMICAL ASPECTS OF THE STUDY OF CLUSTERS NANOSTRUCTURES
   AND NANOMATERIALS
AB In the last decade, variational quantum algorithms implemented on modern quantum computers have successfully solved practical problems of optimization, quantum chemistry, and machine learning. We propose new variational quantum algorithm based on a Monte Carlo scheme that uses a random selection of the generators for a unitary transformation, and also uses optimization of the objective functional employing the annealing or Metropolis-Hastings algorithm. The states of the quantum system in the form of a density operator and its model Hamiltonian are represented by expansions in the Pauli basis. In the algorithm, the state of the system is changed by means of a random choice of the Pauli generator that determines the unitary transformation of the state. The efficiency of the annealing algorithm directly depends on the equiprobable choice of the transition from one state to the second, so the work uses a compromise version of the uniform distribution of operators on the SU (2 n ) group - the direct product of the SU (2) group, where n is the number of qubits in the system. The random choice of a single-qubit operator (consistent with the Haar measure on SU (2)) is implemented in Hopf coordinates on the group manifold (the three-sphere). The results of testing the algorithm show that it can be effective for low-dimensional systems.

TI Quantum noise protects quantum classifiers against adversaries
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Noise in quantum information processing is often viewed as a disruptive and difficult-to-avoid feature, especially in near-term quantum technologies. However, noise has often played beneficial roles, from enhancing weak signals in stochastic resonance to protecting the privacy of data in differential privacy. It is then natural to ask: Can we harness the power of quantum noise that is beneficial to quantum computing? An important current direction for quantum computing is its application to machine learning, such as classification problems. One outstanding problem in machine learning for classification is its sensitivity to adversarial examples. These are small, undetectable perturbations from the original data where the perturbed data is completely misclassified in otherwise extremely accurate classifiers. They can also be considered as worst-case perturbations by unknown noise sources. We show that by taking advantage of depolarization noise in quantum circuits for classification, a robustness bound against adversaries can be derived where the robustness improves with increasing noise. This robustness property is intimately connected with an important security concept called differential privacy, which can be extended to quantum differential privacy. For the protection of quantum data, this quantum protocol can be used against the most general adversaries. Furthermore, we show how the robustness in the classical case can be sensitive to the details of the classification model, but in the quantum case the details of the classification model are absent, thus also providing a potential quantum advantage for classical data. This opens the opportunity to explore other ways in which quantum noise can be used in our favor, as well as identifying other ways quantum algorithms can be helpful in a way which is distinct from quantum speedups.

TI Assisted cloning of an unknown shared quantum state
SO PLOS ONE
AB We first propose a novel protocol to realize quantum cloning of an arbitrary unknown shared state with assistance offered by a state preparer. The initial phase of this protocol involves the utilization of quantum teleportation (QT), enabling the transfer of quantum information from an arbitrary number of senders to another arbitrary number of receivers through a maximally entangled GHZ-type state serving as a network channel, without centralizing the information at any specific location. In the second stage of this protocol, the state preparer performs a special single-qubit projective measurement and multiple Z-basis measurements and then communicates a number of classical bits corresponding to measurement results, the perfect copy or orthogonal-complementing copy of an unknown shared state can be produced at senders hands. Then, using a non-maximally entangled GHZ-type state instead of the aforementioned quantum channel, we extend the proposed protocol from three perspectives: projective measurement, positive operator-value measurement (POVM), and a single generalized Bell-state measurement. Our schemes can relay quantum information over a network without requiring fully trusted central or intermediate nodes, and none of participants can fully access the information.

TI Engineering qubit dynamics in open systems with photonic synthetic
   lattices
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB The evolution of a quantum system interacting with an environment can be described as a unitary process acting on both the system and the environment. In this framework, the system's evolution can be predicted by tracing out the environmental degrees of freedom. Here, we establish a precise mapping between the global unitary dynamics and the quantum operation involving the system, wherein the system is a single qubit, and the environment is modeled as a discrete lattice space. This approach enables the implementation of arbitrary noise operations on single-polarization qubits using a minimal set of three liquid-crystal metasurfaces, whose transverse distribution of the optic axes can be patterned to reproduce the target process. We experimentally validate this method by simulating common noise processes, such as phase errors and depolarization. Besides providing a practical solution for quantum state purification, this work demonstrates a versatile approach for the simulation of open qubit dynamics, with potential implications for quantum error correction and environmentinduced quantum phase transitions.

TI Bayesian phase difference estimation: a general quantum algorithm for
   the direct calculation of energy gaps
SO PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY CHEMICAL PHYSICS
AB Quantum computers can perform full configuration interaction (full-CI) calculations by utilising the quantum phase estimation (QPE) algorithms including Bayesian phase estimation (BPE) and iterative quantum phase estimation (IQPE). In these quantum algorithms, the time evolution of wave functions for atoms and molecules is simulated conditionally with an ancillary qubit as the control, which make implementation to real quantum devices difficult. Also, most of the problems in chemistry discuss energy differences between two electronic states rather than total energies themselves, and thus direct calculations of energy gaps are promising for future applications of quantum computers to real chemistry problems. In the race of finding efficient quantum algorithms to solve quantum chemistry problems, we test a Bayesian phase difference estimation (BPDE) algorithm, which is a general algorithm to calculate the difference of two eigenphases of unitary operators in the several cases of the direct calculations of energy gaps between two electronic states on quantum computers, including vertical ionisation energies, singlet-triplet energy gaps, and vertical excitation energies. In the BPDE algorithm, state preparation is carried out conditionally on the ancillary qubit, and the time evolution of the wave functions in superposition of two electronic states are executed unconditionally. Based on our test, we conclude that BPDE is capable of computing the energy gap with an accuracy similar to BPE without controlled-time evolution simulations and with the smaller number of iterations in Bayesian optimisations.

TI Demonstrating the power of quantum computers, certification of highly
   entangled measurements and scalable quantum nonlocality
SO NPJ QUANTUM INFORMATION
AB Increasingly sophisticated quantum computers motivate the exploration of their abilities in certifying genuine quantum phenomena. Here, we demonstrate the power of state-of-the-art IBM quantum computers in correlation experiments inspired by quantum networks. Our experiments feature up to 12 qubits and require the implementation of paradigmatic Bell-State Measurements for scalable entanglement-swapping. First, we demonstrate quantum correlations that defy classical models in up to nine-qubit systems while only assuming that the quantum computer operates on qubits. Harvesting these quantum advantages, we are able to certify 82 basis elements as entangled in a 512-outcome measurement. Then, we relax the qubit assumption and consider quantum nonlocality in a scenario with multiple independent entangled states arranged in a star configuration. We report quantum violations of source-independent Bell inequalities for up to ten qubits. Our results demonstrate the ability of quantum computers to outperform classical limitations and certify scalable entangled measurements.

TI Algorithms for Quantum Simulation at Finite Energies
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB We introduce two kinds of quantum algorithm to explore microcanonical and canonical properties of many-body systems. The first is a hybrid quantum algorithm that, given an efficiently preparable state, computes expectation values in a finite energy interval around its mean energy. This algorithm is based on a filtering operator, similar to quantum phase estimation, which filters out energies outside the desired energy interval. However, instead of performing this operation on a physical state, it recovers the physical values by performing interferometric measurements without the need to prepare the filtered state. We show that the computational time scales polynomially with the number of qubits, the inverse of the prescribed variance, and the inverse error. In practice, the algorithm does not require the evolution for long times, but instead a significant number of measurements in order to obtain sensible results. Our second algorithm is a quantum assisted Monte Carlo sampling method to compute other quantities that approach the expectation values for the microcanonical and canonical ensembles. Using classical Monte Carlo techniques and the quantum computer as a resource, this method circumvents the sign problem that plagues classical quantum Monte Carlo simulations, as long as one can prepare states with suitable energies. All algorithms can be used with small quantum computers and analog quantum simulators, as long as they can perform the interferometric measurements. We also show that this last task can be greatly simplified at the expense of performing more measurements.

TI Benchmarking adversarially robust quantum machine learning at scale
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Machine learning (ML) methods such as artificial neural networks are rapidly becoming ubiquitous in modern science, technology, and industry. Despite their accuracy and sophistication, neural networks can be easily fooled by carefully designed malicious inputs known as adversarial attacks. While such vulnerabilities remain a serious challenge for classical neural networks, the extent of their existence is not fully understood in the quantum ML setting. In this paper, we benchmark the robustness of quantum ML networks, such as quantum variational classifiers (QVC), at scale by performing rigorous training for both simple and complex image datasets and through a variety of high-end adversarial attacks. Our results show that QVCs offer a notably enhanced robustness against classical adversarial attacks by learning features, which are not detected by the classical neural networks, indicating a possible quantum advantage for ML tasks. Contrarily, and remarkably, the converse is not true, with attacks on quantum networks also capable of deceiving classical neural networks. By combining quantum and classical network outcomes, we propose an adversarial attack detection technology. Traditionally quantum advantage in ML systems has been sought through increased accuracy or algorithmic speed-up, but our study has revealed the potential for a kind of quantum advantage through superior robustness of ML models, whose practical realization will address serious security concerns and reliability issues of ML algorithms employed in a myriad of applications including autonomous vehicles, cybersecurity, and surveillance robotic systems.

TI Enhancing Text Classification Through Quantum Transfer Learning: A
   Hybrid Quantum-Classical Approach With Complex Kernel Self-Attention
   Networks
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB Quantum computing, with its unique principles such as superposition and entanglement, promises to transform various domains, including artificial intelligence. This study investigates the fusion of quantum computing with contemporary AI technologies through quantum transfer learning. We introduce the Complex Quantum Kernel Self-Attention Network (CQKSAN), a novel model that leverages quantum circuits and self-attention mechanisms to boost text classification performance. By applying quantum transfer learning, CQKSAN harnesses the strengths of pre-trained classical models and enhances them with quantum capabilities. Experimental results on multiple binary classification datasets demonstrate that CQKSAN achieves a more efficient learning process. Specifically, it improves training accuracy and validation accuracy by up to 24.31% and 28.35%, respectively, and increases the Matthews Correlation Coefficient by 113.10%. Moreover, CQKSAN consistently outperforms the BERT baseline in both training and validation accuracy across various datasets, showcasing its strong learning capability and generalization performance in handling tasks with diverse linguistic structures and complex semantics. Our findings underscore the potential of hybrid quantum-classical approaches, while also identifying the current limitations and paving the way for future research in fully quantum-based learning systems.

TI Using copies can improve precision in continuous-time quantum computing
SO QUANTUM SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB In the quantum optimisation setting, we build on a scheme introduced by Young et al (2013 Phys. Rev. A 88 062314), where physical qubits in multiple copies of a problem encoded into an Ising spin Hamiltonian are linked together to increase the logical system's robustness to error. We introduce several innovations that improve the error suppression of this scheme under a special model of control noise, designed to understand how limited precision could be overcome. First, we note that only one copy needs to be correct by the end of the computation, since solution quality can be checked efficiently. Second, we find that ferromagnetic links do not generally help in this 'one correct copy' setting, but anti-ferromagnetic links do help on average, by suppressing the chance of the same error being present on all of the copies. Third, we find that minimum-strength anti-ferromagnetic links perform best, by counteracting the spin-flips induced by the errors. We have numerically tested our innovations on small instances of spin glasses from Callison et al (2019 New J. Phys. 21 123022), and we find improved error tolerance for three or more copies in configurations that include frustration. Interpreted as an effective precision increase, we obtain several extra bits of precision on average for three copies connected in a triangle. This provides proof-of-concept of a method for scaling quantum annealing beyond the precision limits of hardware, a step towards fault tolerance in this setting.

TI Quantum computing for classical problems: variational quantum
   eigensolver for activated processes
SO NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB The theory of stochastic processes impacts both physical and social sciences. At the molecular scale, stochastic dynamics is ubiquitous because of thermal fluctuations. The Fokker-Plank-Smoluchowski equation models the time evolution of the probability density of selected degrees of freedom in the diffusive regime and it is, therefore, a workhorse of physical chemistry. In this paper we report on the development and implementation of a variational quantum eigensolver to solve the Fokker-Planck-Smoluchowski eigenvalue problem. We show that such an algorithm, typically adopted to address quantum chemistry problems, can be effectively applied to classical systems, paving the way to new applications of quantum computers. We compute the conformational transition rate in a linear chain of rotors with nearest-neighbour interactions. We provide a method to encode the probability distribution for a given conformation of the chain on a quantum computer and assess its scalability in terms of operations. A performance analysis on noisy quantum emulators and quantum devices (IBMQ Santiago) is provided for a small chain which shows results in good agreement with the classical benchmark without any further addition of error mitigation techniques.

TI Collective Randomized Measurements in Quantum Information Processing
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB The concept of randomized measurements on individual particles has proven to be useful for analyzing quantum systems and is central for methods like shadow tomography of quantum states. We introduce collective randomized measurements as a tool in quantum information processing. Our idea is to perform measurements of collective angular momentum on a quantum system and actively rotate the directions using simultaneous multilateral unitaries. Based on the moments of the resulting probability distribution, we propose systematic approaches to characterize quantum entanglement in a collective-reference-frameindependent manner. First, we show that existing spin-squeezing inequalities can be accessible in this scenario. Next, we present an entanglement criterion based on three-body correlations, going beyond spin-squeezing inequalities with two-body correlations. Finally, we apply our method to characterize entanglement between spatially separated two ensembles.

TI Quantum Walk Computing: Theory, Implementation, and Application
SO INTELLIGENT COMPUTING
AB The classical random walk formalism plays an important role in a wide range of applications. Its quantum counterpart, the quantum walk, is proposed as an important theoretical model for quantum computing. By exploiting quantum effects such as superposition, interference, and entanglement, quantum walks and their variations have been extensively studied for achieving computing power beyond that of classical computing and have been broadly used in designing quantum algorithms for algebraic and optimization problems, graph and network analysis, and quantum Hamiltonian and biochemical process simulations. Moreover, quantum walk models have been proven capable of universal quantum computation. Unlike conventional quantum circuit models, quantum walks provide a feasible path for implementing application-specific quantum computing, particularly in the noisy intermediate-scale quantum era. Recently, remarkable progress has been achieved in implementing a wide variety of quantum walks and quantum walk applications, which demonstrates the great potential of quantum walks. In this review, we provide a thorough summary of quantum walks and quantum walk computing, including theories and characteristics, physical implementations, and applications. We also discuss the challenges facing quantum walk computing, which aims to realize a practical quantum computer in the near future.

TI On the Interpretability of Neural Network Decoders
SO ADVANCED QUANTUM TECHNOLOGIES
AB Neural-network (NN) based decoders are becoming increasingly popular in the field of quantum error correction (QEC), including for decoding of state-of-the-art quantum computation experiments. In this work, established interpretability methods are used from the field of machine learning, to introduce a toolbox to achieve an understanding of the underlying decoding logic of NN decoders, which have been trained but otherwise typically operate as black-box models. To illustrate the capabilities of the employed interpretability method, based on the Shapley value approximation, an examplary case study of a NN decoder is provided that is trained for flag-qubit based fault-tolerant (FT) QEC with the Steane code. The interpretation of particular decoding decisions of the NN is analysed, by doing so it is revealed how the NN learns to capture fundamental structures in the information gained from syndrome and flag qubit measurements, in order to come to a FT correction decision. Further, it is showed that the understanding of how the NN obtains a decoding decision can be used on the one hand to identify flawed processing of error syndrome information by the NN, resulting in decreased decoding performance, as well as for well-informed improvements of the NN architecture. The diagnostic capabilities of the interpretability method presented here can help ensure successful application of machine learning for decoding of QEC protocols.

TI Fault-tolerant quantum computation with polylogarithmic time and
   constant space overheads
SO NATURE PHYSICS
AB A major challenge in fault-tolerant quantum computation is to reduce both the space overhead, that is, the large number of physical qubits per logical qubit, and the time overhead, that is, the long physical gate sequences needed to implement a logical gate. Here we prove that a protocol using non-vanishing-rate quantum low-density parity-check (QLDPC) codes, combined with concatenated Steane codes, achieves constant space overhead and polylogarithmic time overhead, even when accounting for the required classical processing. This protocol offers an improvement over existing constant-space-overhead protocols. To prove our result, we develop a technique that we call partial circuit reduction, which enables error analysis for the entire fault-tolerant circuit by examining smaller parts composed of a few gadgets. With this approach, we resolve a logical gap in the existing arguments for the threshold theorem for the constant-space-overhead protocol with QLDPC codes and complete its proof. Our work establishes that the QLDPC-code-based approach can realize fault-tolerant quantum computation with a negligibly small slowdown and a bounded overhead of physical qubits.

This scheme involves the use of two resonant laser pulses that transition from initial and final states to an intermediate level exhibiting irreversible losses. In comparison to alternative techniques, our approach offers computational efficiency advantages. Notably, the analytically defined form of the pump pulse enables tailored control strategies, enhancing robustness against decoherence and imperfections. This flexibility extends to choosing dump pulses and designing time evolution scenarios. These features open doors for practical implementation and scalability in quantum technologies, with potential applications in quantum information processing, quantum computing, and quantum communication.

TI Collective quantum entanglement in molecular cavity optomechanics
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
AB We propose an optomechanical scheme for reaching quantum entanglement in vibration polaritons. The system involves N molecules, whose vibrations can be fairly entangled with plasmonic cavities. We find that the vibration-photon entanglement can exist at room temperature and is robust against thermal noise. We further demonstrate the quantum entanglement between the vibrational modes through the plasmonic cavities, which shows a delocalized nature and an incredible enhancement with the number of molecules. Moreover, we find that the vibration-vibration entanglement reaches its maximum when the number of molecules in the two collective modes is equal, and it can be proved analytically. The underlying mechanism for the entanglement generation is attributed to the strong vibration-cavity coupling which possesses collectivity. Our results provide a molecular optomechanical scheme which offers a promising platform for the study of noise-free quantum resources and macroscopic quantum phenomena.

TI Simulation of the Unruh signals of decoherence with quantum circuits
SO RESULTS IN PHYSICS
AB Detecting the Unruh effect is currently an important experimental goal, but it is difficult to realize under laboratory conditions because of the extreme acceleration required for observable signals. Therefore, various schemes for indirect detection have been proposed. Recently, Nesterov and his collaborators discovered that the exponential phase decay in the decoherence of a uniformly accelerated particle detector can significantly improve the conditions for measuring the Unruh effect, and the acceleration required for observable signals can be considerably reduced to & SIM;1013 m/s2. We notice that this exponential phase decay is consistent with its counterpart of the dephasing channel in quantum information theory. In this paper, we use the IBM quantum cloud platform to construct a quantum circuit that can realize the dephasing channel, successfully simulate the Unruh signal, and test the correctness of the method.

TI On-Demand Source of Dual-Rail Photon Pairs Based on Chiral Interaction
   in a Nanophotonic Waveguide
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB Entanglement is the fuel of advanced quantum technology, enabling, e.g., measurement-based quantum computing and loss-tolerant encoding of quantum information. In photonics, entanglement has tradition-ally been generated probabilistically, requiring massive multiplexing for scaling up to many photons. An alternative approach utilizing quantum emitters in nanophotonic devices can realize deterministic genera-tion of entangled photons. However, such sources generate polarization entanglement that is incompatible with spatial dual-rail qubit encoding employed in scalable photonic quantum-computing platforms uti-lizing integrated circuits. Here we propose and experimentally realize an on-demand source of dual-rail photon pairs using a quantum dot in a planar nanophotonic waveguide. The source exploits the cascaded decay of a biexciton state and chiral light-matter coupling to achieve deterministic generation of spatial dual-rail Bell pairs with the amount of entanglement determined by the chirality. The operational princi-ple can readily be extended to multiphoton entanglement generation required for efficient preparation of resource states for photonic quantum computing.

TI Techniques for combining fast local decoders with global decoders under
   circuit-level noise
SO QUANTUM SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB Implementing algorithms on a fault-tolerant quantum computer will require fast decoding throughput and latency times to prevent an exponential increase in buffer times between the applications of gates. In this work we begin by quantifying these requirements. We then introduce the construction of local neural network (NN) decoders using three-dimensional convolutions. These local decoders are adapted to circuit-level noise and can be applied to surface code volumes of arbitrary size. Their application removes errors arising from a certain number of faults, which serves to substantially reduce the syndrome density. Remaining errors can then be corrected by a global decoder, such as Blossom or union find, with their implementation significantly accelerated due to the reduced syndrome density. However, in the circuit-level setting, the corrections applied by the local decoder introduce many vertical pairs of highlighted vertices. To obtain a low syndrome density in the presence of vertical pairs, we consider a strategy of performing a syndrome collapse which removes many vertical pairs and reduces the size of the decoding graph used by the global decoder. We also consider a strategy of performing a vertical cleanup, which consists of removing all local vertical pairs prior to implementing the global decoder. By applying our local NN decoder and the vertical cleanup strategy to a d= 17 surface code volume, we show a 10(6)x speedup of the minimum-weight perfect matching decoder. Lastly, we estimate the cost of implementing our local decoders on field programmable gate arrays.

TI Modelling and experimental testing of an optical synchronisation beacon
   designed for high-loss satellite quantum communication
SO IET QUANTUM COMMUNICATION
AB Long-distance free space quantum key distribution based on CubeSats can be used to establish global quantum secure communication networks, with potential commercial applications benefitting from the low cost of its design and launch. Detecting single-photon level optical pulses sent from space requires highly accurate and robust timing systems to pick out signals from the noise. For such high-loss applications, we envisage a low-repetition (sub-MHz) beacon laser emitting short (ns) high-peak-power pulses from which interpolated quantum signal arrival windows can be derived. We firstly study theoretically the effects of jitter on the efficiency of gating quantum signals including all important jitter sources, and then experimentally investigated it by changing the clock jitter, and the result shows that the greater jitter will reduce the gating rate of the signal. The experimental interpolation error is tested against loss under laboratory conditions giving results close to our model. We also found that the jitter introduced by the Doppler effect can be ignored with a repetition rate larger than 1 kHz. This model can be directly used for the performance analysis and optimisation of all quantum and non-quantum systems using similar synchronisation schemes over terrestrial free space or fibre.

AB We introduce a class of circuits that solve a particular case of the Bernstein-Vazirani recursive problem for second-level recursion. This class of circuits allows for the implementation of the oracle using a number of T-gates that grows linearly with the number of qubits in the problem. We find an application of this scheme to quantum homomorphic encryption (QHE), which is an important cryptographic technology useful for delegated quantum computing, allowing a remote server to perform quantum computations on encrypted quantum data, so that the server cannot know anything about the client's data. Liang's QHE schemes are suitable for circuits with a polynomial number of gates T/T dagger. Thus, the simplified circuits we have constructed can be evaluated homomorphically in an efficient manner.

TI A Novel Framework to Construct S-Box Quantum Circuits Using System
   Modeling: Application to 4-Bit S-Boxes
SO CMES-COMPUTER MODELING IN ENGINEERING & SCIENCES
AB Quantum computers accelerate many algorithms based on the superposition principle of quantum mechanics. The Grover algorithm provides significant performance to malicious users attacking symmetric key systems. Since the performance of attacks using quantum computers depends on the efficiency of the quantum circuit of the encryption algorithms, research research on the implementation of quantum circuits is essential. This paper presents a new framework to construct quantum circuits of substitution boxes (S-boxes) using system modeling. We model the quantum circuits of S-boxes using two layers: Toffoli and linear layers. We generate vector spaces based on the values of qubits used in the linear layers and apply them to find quantum circuits. The framework finds the circuit by matching elements of vector spaces generated from the input and output of a given S-box, using the forward search or the meet-in-the-middle strategy. We developed a tool to apply this framework to 4-bit S-boxes. While the 4-bit S-box quantum circuit construction tool LIGHTER-R only finds circuits that can be implemented with four qubits, the proposed tool achieves the circuits with five qubits. The proposed tool can find quantum circuits of 4-bit odd permutations based on the controlled NOT, NOT, and Toffoli gates, whereas LIGHTER-R is unable to perform this task in the same environment. We expect this technique to become a critical step toward optimizing S-box quantum circuits.

TI Accelerating two-dimensional electronic spectroscopy simulations with a
   probe qubit protocol
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Two-dimensional electronic spectroscopy (2DES) is a powerful tool for exploring quantum effects in energy transport within photosynthetic systems and investigating novel material properties. However, simulating the dynamics of these experiments poses significant challenges for classical computers due to the large system sizes, long timescales, and numerous experiment repetitions involved. This paper introduces the probe qubit protocol (PQP)-for quantum simulation of 2DES on quantum devices-addressing these challenges. The PQP offers several enhancements over standard methods, notably reducing computational resources, by requiring only a single-qubit measurement per circuit run and achieving Heisenberg scaling in detection frequency resolution, without the need to apply expensive controlled evolution operators in the quantum circuit. The implementation of the PQP protocol requires only one additional ancilla qubit, the probe qubit, with one-to-all connectivity and two-qubit interactions between each system and probe qubits. We evaluate the computational resources necessary for this protocol in detail, demonstrating its function as a dynamic frequency-filtering method through numerical simulations. We find that simulations of the PQP on classical and quantum computers enable a reduction on the number of measurements, i.e., simulation runtime, and memory savings of several orders of magnitude relative to standard quantum simulation protocols of 2DES. The paper discusses the applicability of the PQP on near-term quantum devices and highlights potential applications where this spectroscopy simulation protocol could provide significant speedups over standard approaches such as the quantum simulation of 2DES applied to the Fenna-Matthews-Olson (FMO) complex in green sulfur bacteria.

TI Receiver-device-independent quantum key distribution protocols
SO NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB We discuss quantum key distribution protocols and their security analysis, considering a receiver-device-independent (RDI) model. The sender's (Alice's) device is partially characterized, in the sense that we assume bounds on the overlaps of the prepared quantum states. The receiver's (Bob's) device requires no characterisation and can be represented as a black-box. Our protocols are therefore robust to any attack on Bob, such as blinding attacks. In particular, we show that a secret key can be established even when the quantum channel has arbitrarily low transmission by considering RDI protocols exploiting sufficiently many states. Finally, we discuss how the hypothesis of bounded overlaps can be naturally applied to practical devices.

AB Hybrid quantum-classical workflows have become standard methods for executing variational algorithms and other quantum simulation techniques, which are key applications for noisy intermediate scale quantum (NISQ) computers. Validating these simulations is an important task which helps gauge the progress of quantum computer development, and classical simulation can serve as a tool to this end. Both exact and more scalable approximate methods with quantifiable error bounds can be used in validation tasks where the applicable metrics include the distance from a calculable ground truth, the quality of an error model fit to data, etc. Here we present a library extension that includes methods for validation of quantum simulations based on scalable hybrid workflows executable on high performance computers. We provide examples that use approximate methods based on tensor networks and stabilizer simulators to bound the error of quantum simulations on NISQ hardware.

TI Customized Quantum Annealing Schedules
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW APPLIED
AB In a typical quantum annealing protocol, the system starts with a transverse field Hamiltonian that is gradually turned off and replaced by a longitudinal Ising Hamiltonian. The ground state of the Ising Hamiltonian encodes the solution to the computational problem of interest, and the state overlap with this ground state gives the success probability of the annealing protocol. The form of the annealing schedule can have a significant impact on the ground-state overlap at the end of the anneal, so precise control over these annealing schedules can be a powerful tool for increasing success probabilities of annealing protocols. Here we show how superconducting circuits, in particular capacitively shunted flux qubits, can be used to construct quantum annealing systems by providing tools for mapping circuit flux biases to Pauli coefficients. We use this mapping to find customized annealing schedules: appropriate circuit control biases that yield a desired annealing schedule, while accounting for the physical limitations of the circuitry. We then provide examples and proposals that utilize this capability to improve quantum annealing performance.

AB Quantum networks connect quantum capable nodes in order to achieve capabilities that are impossible only using classical information. Their fundamental unit of communication is the Bell pair, which consists of two entangled quantum bits. Unfortunately, Bell pairs are fragile and difficult to transmit directly, necessitating a network of repeaters, along with software and hardware that can ensure the desired results. Challenging intrinsic features of quantum networks, such as dealing with resource competition, motivate formal reasoning about quantum network protocols. To this end, we developed BellKAT, a novel specification language for quantum networks based upon Kleene algebra. To cater to the specific needs of quantum networks, we designed an algebraic structure, called BellSKA, which we use as the basis of BellKAT's denotational semantics. BellKAT's constructs describe entanglement distribution rules that allow for modular specification. We give BellKAT a sound and complete equational theory, allowing us to verify network protocols. We provide a prototype tool to showcase the expressiveness of BellKAT and how to optimize and verify networks in practice.

TI Characterization and Tomography of a Hidden Qubit
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW X
AB In circuit-based quantum computing the available gate set typically consists of single-qubit gates acting on each individual qubit and at least one entangling gate between pairs of qubits. In certain physical architectures, however, some qubits may be "hidden" and lacking direct addressability through dedicated control and readout lines, for instance, because of limited on-chip routing capabilities, or because the number of control lines becomes a limiting factor for many-qubit systems. In this case, no single-qubit operations can be applied to the hidden qubits and their state cannot be measured directly. Instead, they may be controlled and read out only via single-qubit operations on connected "control" qubits and a suitable set of two-qubit gates. We first discuss the impact of such restricted control capabilities on the performance of specific qubit coupling networks. We then experimentally demonstrate full control and measurement capabilities in a superconducting two-qubit device with local single-qubit control and iSWAP and controlledphase two-qubit interactions enabled by a tunable coupler. We further introduce an iterative tune-up process required to completely characterize the gate set used for quantum process tomography and evaluate the resulting gate fidelities.

TI Quantum simulation of the Lindblad equation using a unitary
   decomposition of operators
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Accurate simulation of the time evolution of a quantum system under the influence of an environment is critical to making accurate predictions in chemistry, condensed-matter physics, and materials sciences. Whereas there has been a recent surge in interest in quantum algorithms for the prediction of nonunitary time evolution in quantum systems, few studies offer a direct quantum analog to the Lindblad equation. Here, we present a quantum algorithm-utilizing a decomposition of nonunitary operators approach-that models dynamic processes via the unraveled Lindblad equation. This algorithm is employed to probe both a two-level system in an amplitude damping channel as well as the transverse field Ising model in a variety of parameter regimes; the resulting population dynamics demonstrate excellent agreement with classical simulation, showing the promise of predicting population dynamics utilizing quantum devices for a variety of important systems in molecular energy transport, quantum optics, and other open quantum systems.

TI Dynamics of van derWaals charge qubit in two-dimensional bilayer
   materials: Ab initio quantum transport and qubit measurement
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB A van der Waals (vdW) charge qubit, electrostatically confined within two-dimensional (2D) vdW materials, is proposed as a building block of future quantum computers. Its characteristics are systematically evaluated with respect to its two-level anticrossing energy difference ( Delta ). Bilayer graphene ( Delta approximate to 0) and a vdW heterostructure ( Delta >> 0) are used as representative examples. Their tunable electronic properties with an external electric field define the state of the charge qubit. By combining density functional theory and quantum transport calculations, we highlight the optimal qubit operation conditions based on charge stability and energy-level diagrams. Moreover, a single-electron transistor design based on trilayer vdW heterostructures capacitively coupled to the charge qubit is introduced as a measurement setup with low decoherence and improved measurement properties. It is found that a Delta greater than 20 meV results in a rapid mixing of the qubit states, which leads to a lower measurement quantity, i.e., contrast and conductance. With properly optimized designs, qubit architectures relying on 2D vdW structures could be integrated into an all-electronic quantum computing platform.

TI Quantum communication on the bosonic loss-dephasing channel
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Quantum optical systems are typically affected by two types of noise: photon loss and dephasing. Despite extensive research on each noise process individually, a comprehensive understanding of their combined effect is still lacking. A crucial problem lies in determining the values of loss and dephasing for which the resulting loss-dephasing channel is antidegradable, implying the absence of codes capable of correcting its effect or, alternatively, capable of enabling quantum communication. A conjecture [Quantum 6, 821 (2022)] suggested that the bosonic loss-dephasing channel is not antidegradable if the loss is below 50%. In this paper we refute this conjecture, specifically proving that for any value of the loss, if the dephasing is above a critical value, then the bosonic loss-dephasing channel is antidegradable. While our result identifies a large parameter region where quantum communication is not possible, we also prove that if two-way classical communication is available, then quantum communication-and thus quantum key distribution-is always achievable, even for high values of loss and dephasing.

TI Measurement-based quantum simulation of Abelian lattice gauge theories
SO SCIPOST PHYSICS
AB Numerical simulation of lattice gauge theories is an indispensable tool in high energy physics, and their quantum simulation is expected to become a major application of quantum computers in the future. In this work, for an Abelian lattice gauge theory in d spacetime dimensions, we define an entangled resource state (generalized cluster state) that reflects the spacetime structure of the gauge theory. We show that sequential single-qubit measurements with the bases adapted according to the former measurement out-comes induce a deterministic Hamiltonian quantum simulation of the gauge theory on the boundary. Our construction includes the (2 + 1)-dimensional Abelian lattice gauge theory simulated on three-dimensional cluster state as an example, and generalizes to the simulation of Wegner's lattice models M(d,n) that involve higher-form Abelian gauge fields. We demonstrate that the generalized cluster state has a symmetry-protected topo-logical order with respect to generalized global symmetries that are related to the sym-metries of the simulated gauge theories on the boundary.Our procedure can be gener-alized to the simulation of Kitaev's Majorana chain on a fermionic resource state. We also study the imaginary-time quantum simulation with two-qubit measurements and post-selections, and a classical-quantum correspondence, where the statistical partition function of the model M-(d,M-n) is written as the overlap between the product of two-qubit measurement bases and the wave function of the generalized cluster state.

TI Topologically protected chainwise microwave-to-optical photon conversion
   interfaced by nitrogen-vacancy center ensembles
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB The pumped Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) model has been extensively employed for robust quantum state transfer (QST) due to its topologically protected edge channels that exhibit intrinsic resilience against local perturbations. Hybrid quantum systems have garnered significant research interest due to their unique capacity to collect distinct advantageous features that are inherently incompatible within individual physical platforms. Here, we propose a topological QST protocol for microwave (MW)-to-optical photon conversion in a synthesized SSH chain of a hybrid system. The topological structure is constructed by connecting superconducting resonators with optical cavities through interfaces of nitrogen-vacancy center ensembles. More importantly, we shorten the duration threshold of adiabatic evolution through power-law coupling engineering, and provide favorable conditions for high-efficiency MW-to-optical photon conversion, which significantly improves the scalability of the transducer with respect to both the system size and the number of converted photons. This approach paves the way for establishing high-efficiency quantum interfaces between localized MW quantum circuits and optical fiber networks, which is essential for long-distance quantum communication and distributed quantum computing.

TI Entanglement and Magic Correlations Generated by Discrete Beam-Splitters
SO ANNALEN DER PHYSIK
AB Beam-splitters are basic and instrumental tools not only in the study of foundational issues in quantum mechanics, but also in various applications of quantum information processing. In the continuous-variable scenario involving quantum optical states and Gaussian quantum information, interference phenomena are widely investigated and characterized via beam-splitters. In this work, within the framework of stabilizer quantum computation in finite quantum systems, entanglement and magic correlations generated by discrete beam-splitters are explored. Two types of magic correlations are distinguished: mutual magic (analogous to quantum mutual information) and non-local magic. Explicit formulas for these correlations are derived in the qubit scenario where the beam-splitter is implemented by the controlled-NOT gate, with the H$H$-type magic states playing a particularly prominent role as input states. Extending to prime-dimensional qudit systems, it is shown that fiducial states of mutually unbiased bases also play a remarkable role. Basic properties of these magic correlations are revealed and illustrated through some typical examples.

TI Noise-induced barren plateaus in variational quantum algorithms
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Variational quantum algorithms (VQAs) are a leading candidate for useful applications of near-term quantum computing, but limitations due to unavoidable noise have not been clearly characterized. Here, the authors prove that local Pauli noise can cause vanishing gradients rendering VQAs untrainable.
   Variational Quantum Algorithms (VQAs) may be a path to quantum advantage on Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) computers. A natural question is whether noise on NISQ devices places fundamental limitations on VQA performance. We rigorously prove a serious limitation for noisy VQAs, in that the noise causes the training landscape to have a barren plateau (i.e., vanishing gradient). Specifically, for the local Pauli noise considered, we prove that the gradient vanishes exponentially in the number of qubits n if the depth of the ansatz grows linearly with n. These noise-induced barren plateaus (NIBPs) are conceptually different from noise-free barren plateaus, which are linked to random parameter initialization. Our result is formulated for a generic ansatz that includes as special cases the Quantum Alternating Operator Ansatz and the Unitary Coupled Cluster Ansatz, among others. For the former, our numerical heuristics demonstrate the NIBP phenomenon for a realistic hardware noise model.

TI A polynomial time and space heuristic algorithm for T-count
SO QUANTUM SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB An important part of reaping computational advantage from a quantum computer is to reduce the quantum resources needed to implement a desired quantum algorithm. Quantum algorithms that are too large to be practical on noisy intermediate scale quantum devices will require fault-tolerant error correction. This work focuses on reducing the physical cost of implementing quantum algorithms when using the state-of-the-art fault-tolerant quantum error correcting codes, in particular, those for which implementing the T gate consumes vastly more resources than the other gates in the gate set. More specifically, in this paper we consider the group of unitaries that can be exactly implemented by a quantum circuit consisting of the Clifford + T gate set. The Clifford + T gate set is a universal gate set and in this group, using state-of-the-art surface codes, the T gate is by far the most expensive component to implement fault-tolerantly. So it is important to minimize the number of T gates necessary for a fault-tolerant implementation. Our primary interest is to compute a circuit for a given n-qubit unitary U, using the minimum possible number of T gates (called the T-count of unitary U). We consider the problem COUNT-T, the optimization version of which aims to find the T-count of U. In its decision version the goal is to decide if the T-count is at most some positive integer m. Given an oracle for COUNT-T, we can compute a T-count-optimal circuit in time polynomial in the T-count and dimension of U. We give a provable classical algorithm that solves COUNT-T (decision) in time ON2(c-1) left ceiling mc right ceiling poly(m,N) ON2 left ceiling mc right ceiling poly(m,N) , where N = 2 (n) and c > 2. This gives a space-time trade-off for solving this problem with variants of meet-in-the-middle techniques. We also introduce an asymptotically faster multiplication method that shaves a factor of N (0.7457) off of the overall complexity. Lastly, beyond our improvements to the rigorous algorithm, we give a heuristic algorithm that outputs a T-count-optimal circuit and has space and time complexity poly(m, N), under some assumptions. In our heuristic algorithm we developed a novel way of pruning the search space. While our heuristic method still scales exponentially with the number of qubits (though with a lower exponent), there is a large improvement by going from exponential to polynomial scaling with m. We implemented our heuristic algorithm with up to 4 qubit unitaries and obtained a significant improvement in time. For all benchmark and random unitaries we studied, the T-count returned by our algorithm is at most the T-count of their circuits shown in previous papers.

These solitons mediate dissipation-free energy transfer along microtubule filaments. We discuss logic-gate-like behaviour facilitated by microtubule-associated proteins, and outline how such structures may enable scalable, ambient-temperature quantum computation, with the fundamental unit of information storage realized as a quDit encoded in the tubulin dipole state. We further describe a process akin to "decision-making" that emerges following an external stimulus, whereby optimal, energy-loss-free signal and information transport pathways are selected across the microtubular network. Finally, we propose experimental approaches-including Rabi-splitting spectroscopy and entangled surface plasmon probes-to validate the use of biomatter as a substrate for scalable quantum computation.

TI Generalized hydrodynamics of integrable quantum circuits
SO SCIPOST PHYSICS
AB Quantum circuits make it possible to simulate the continuous-time dynamics of a manybody Hamiltonian by implementing discrete Trotter steps of duration tau. However, when tau is sufficiently large, the discrete dynamics exhibit qualitative differences compared to the original evolution, potentially displaying novel features and many-body effects. We study an interesting example of this phenomenon, by considering the integrable Trotterization of a prototypical integrable model, the XXZ Heisenberg spin chain. We focus on the well-known bipartition protocol, where two halves of a large system are prepared in different macrostates and suddenly joined together, yielding non-trivial nonequilibrium dynamics. Building upon recent results and adapting the generalized hydrodynamics (GHD) of integrable models, we develop an exact large-scale description of an explicit one-dimensional quantum-circuit setting, where the input left and right qubits are initialized in two distinct product states. We explore the phenomenology predicted by the GHD equations, which depend on the Trotter step and the gate parameters. In some phases of the parameter space, we show that the quantum-circuit large-scale dynamics is qualitatively different compared to the continuous-time evolution. In particular, we find that a single microscopic defect at the junction, such as the addition of a single qubit, may change the nonequilibrium macrostate appearing at late time.

AB In classical cryptography, one-way functions (OWFs) and pseudorandom generators (PRGs) are the minimal assumption. On the other hand, in quantum cryptography, several quantum analogues of OWFs and PRGs have been introduced, and shown to be potentially weaker than OWFs and PRGs. These analogues still imply many useful applications such as private-key quantum money schemes, secret-key encryption, message authentication codes, digital signatures, commitments, and multiparty computations. Now that the possibility of quantum cryptography without OWFs has opened up, the most important goal in the field is to build a foundation of it. In this paper, we, for the first time, characterize quantum cryptographic primitives with metacomplexity. We show that one-way puzzles (OWPuzzs), which are a quantum analogue of OWFs, exist if and only if GapK is weakly-quantumaverage-hard. GapK is a promise problem to decide whether a given bit string has a small Kolmogorov complexity or not. Weakly-quantumaverage-hard means that an instance is sampled from a QPT samplable distribution, and for any QPT adversary the probability that it makes mistake is larger than 1/poly. We also show that if a quantum analogue of PRGs, quantum PRGs, exist then GapK is strongly-quantumaverage-hard. Here, strongly-quantum-average-hard is a stronger version of weakly-quantum-average-hard where the probability that the adversary makes mistake is larger than 1/2 - 1/poly for any poly. Finally, we show that if GapK is weakly-classical-average-hard, then inefficientverifier proofs of quantumness (IV-PoQ) exist. Weakly-classical-averagehard is the same as weakly-quantum-average-hard except that the adversary is PPT. IV-PoQ are a generalization of proofs of quantumness (PoQ) that capture sampling-based and search-based quantum advantage, and an important application of OWPuzzs. This is the fist time that quantum advantage is based on meta-complexity.

TI Polarization-encoded quantum key distribution with a room-temperature
   telecom single-photon emitter
SO NATIONAL SCIENCE REVIEW
AB Single-photon sources (SPSs) are directly applicable in quantum key distribution (QKD) because they allow the implementation of the canonical BB84 protocol. To date, QKD implementations using SPSs are not widespread because of the need for cryogenic operation, or frequency conversion to a wavelength efficiently transmitted over telecommunication fibers. We report an observation of polarization-encoded QKD using a room-temperature telecom SPS based on a GaN defect. A field test over 3.5 km of deployed fiber with 4.0-dB loss yielded a quantum bit error rate (QBER) of 5.0% and a secure key rate of 585.9 bps. Further testing in a 32.5-km fiber spool (attenuation of 11.2 dB), which exhibited substantially lower polarization mode dispersion, yielded a QBER of 3.2% and a secure key rate of 50.4 bps. These results illustrate the potential of the GaN defects for supporting polarization-encoded quantum communication.
   This work explores quantum key distribution over deployed fiber using a room-temperature telecom single-photon source, paving the way towards realistic implementations of single-photon-based quantum communication.

Herein, a method for characterizing the creation of EPR steering and Bell nonlocality is introduced for dynamical processes in experiments. It shows that the capability of an experimental process to create quantum correlations can be quantified and identified simply by preparing separable states as test inputs of the process and then performing local measurements on single qubits of the corresponding outputs. This finding enables the construction of objective benchmarks for the two-qubit controlled operations used to perform universal quantum computation. It demonstrates this utility by examining the experimental capability of creating quantum correlations with the controlled-phase operations on the IBM Quantum Experience and Amazon Braket Rigetti superconducting quantum computers. The results show that the method provides a useful diagnostic tool for evaluating the primitive operations of nonclassical correlation creation in noisy intermediate scale quantum devices.

TI Observation of quantum entanglement with top quarks at the ATLAS
   detector
SO NATURE
AB Entanglement is a key feature of quantum mechanics(1-3), with applications in fields such as metrology, cryptography, quantum information and quantum computation(4-8). It has been observed in a wide variety of systems and length scales, ranging from the microscopic(9-13) to the macroscopic(14-16). However, entanglement remains largely unexplored at the highest accessible energy scales. Here we report the highest-energy observation of entanglement, in top-antitop quark events produced at the Large Hadron Collider, using a proton-proton collision dataset with a centre-of-mass energy of root s=13TeV and an integrated luminosity of 140inverse femtobarns (fb)(-1) recorded with the ATLAS experiment. Spin entanglement is detected from the measurement of a single observable D, inferred from the angle between the charged leptons in their parent top- and antitop-quark rest frames. The observable is measured in a narrow interval around the top-antitop quark production threshold, at which the entanglement detection is expected to be significant. It is reported in a fiducial phase space defined with stable particles to minimize the uncertainties that stem from the limitations of the Monte Carlo event generators and the parton shower model in modelling top-quark pair production. The entanglement marker is measured to be D=-0.5370.002 (stat.)+/- 0.019 (syst.) for 340 GeV < m(t<(t)over bar>) 380 GeV. The observed result is more than five standard deviations from a scenario without entanglement and hence constitutes the first observation of entanglement in a pair of quarks and the highest-energy observation of entanglement so far.

SO ENTROPY
AB As already known by Rana's result, all eigenvalues of any partial-transposed bipartite state fall within the closed interval <mml:semantics>[-<mml:mfrac>12</mml:mfrac>,1]</mml:semantics>. In this note, we study a family of bipartite quantum states where the minimal eigenvalues of partial-transposed states are <mml:semantics>-<mml:mfrac>12</mml:mfrac></mml:semantics>. For a two-qubit system, we find that the minimal eigenvalue of its partial-transposed state is <mml:semantics>-<mml:mfrac>12</mml:mfrac></mml:semantics> if and only if such a two-qubit state is maximally entangled. However this result does not hold in general for a two-qudit system when the dimensions of the underlying space are larger than two.

TI (η8-Cyclooctatetraene)(η5-fluorenyl)titanium: a
   processable molecular spin qubit with optimized control of the
   molecule-substrate interface
SO CHEMICAL SCIENCE
AB Depositing single paramagnetic molecules on surfaces for sensing and quantum computing applications requires subtle topological control. To overcome issues that are often encountered with sandwich metal complexes, we exploit here the low symmetry architecture and suitable vaporability of mixed-sandwich [FluTi(cot)], Flu = fluorenyl, cot = cyclooctatetraene, to drive submonolayer coverage and select an adsorption configuration that preserves the spin of molecules deposited on Au(111). Electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy and ab initio quantum computation evidence a dz2 ground state that protects the spin from phonon-induced relaxation. Additionally, computed and measured spin coherence times exceed 10 mu s despite the molecules being rich in hydrogen. A thorough submonolayer investigation by scanning tunneling microscopy, X-ray photoelectron and absorption spectrocopies and X-ray magnetic circular dichroism measurements supported by DFT calculations reveals that the most stable configuration, with the fluorenyl in contact with the metal surface, prevents titanium(iii) oxidation and spin delocalization to the surface. This is a necessary condition for single molecular spin qubit addressing on surfaces.

TI An orbital-based representation for accurate quantum machine learning
SO JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL PHYSICS
AB We introduce an electronic structure based representation for quantum machine learning (QML) of electronic properties throughout chemical compound space. The representation is constructed using computationally inexpensive ab initio calculations and explicitly accounts for changes in the electronic structure. We demonstrate the accuracy and flexibility of resulting QML models when applied to property labels, such as total potential energy, HOMO and LUMO energies, ionization potential, and electron affinity, using as datasets for training and testing entries from the QM7b, QM7b-T, QM9, and LIBE libraries. For the latter, we also demonstrate the ability of this approach to account for molecular species of different charge and spin multiplicity, resulting in QML models that infer total potential energies based on geometry, charge, and spin as input.

The compact and rack-mountable optics system exhibits high robustness, operating over a year without realignment, regardless of temperature changes in the laboratory. The overall optical system is divided into a few isolated modules interconnected by optical fibers for easy maintenance. The light sources are frequency-stabilized by comparing their frequencies with two complementary references: 1) a commercial Fizeau wavelength meter and 2) a high-finesse optical cavity. This scheme enables automatic frequency stabilization for days with a sub-MHz precision.

TI Robust control of quantum systems by quantum systems
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Quantum systems can be controlled by other quantum systems in a reversible way, without any information leaking to the outside of the system-controller compound. Such coherent quantum control is deterministic, is less noisy than measurement-based feedback control, and has potential applications in a variety of quantum technologies, including quantum computation, quantum communication, and quantum metrology. Here we introduce a coherent feedback protocol, consisting of a sequence of identical interactions with controlling quantum systems, that steers a quantum system from an arbitrary initial state towards a target state. We determine the broad class of such coherent feedback channels that achieve convergence to the target state, and then stabilize as well as protect it against noise. Our results imply that also weak system-controller interactions can counter noise if they occur with suitably high frequency. We present an example of a control scheme that does not require knowledge of the target state encoded in the controllers, which could be the result of a quantum computation. It thus provides a mechanism for autonomous, purely quantum closed-loop control.

TI Neutrinos as qubits and qutrits
SO EUROPEAN PHYSICAL JOURNAL PLUS
AB We map neutrinos to qubit and qutrit states of quantum information theory by constructing the Poincare sphere using SU(2) Pauli matrices and SU(3) Gell-Mann matrices, respectively. The construction of the Poincare sphere in the two-qubit system enables us to construct the Bloch matrix, which yields valuable symmetries in the Bloch vector space of two neutrino systems. By identifying neutrinos with qutrits, we calculate the measures of qutrit entanglement for neutrinos. We use SU(3) Gell-Mann matrices tensor products to construct the Poincare sphere of two qutrits neutrino systems. The comparison between the entanglement measures of bipartite qubits and bipartite qutrits in the two neutrino system are shown. The result warrants a study of two qutrits entanglement in the three neutrino system.

TI Reconstruction of single-photon emission with a self-calibrated wQED
   device based on a transmon qubit
SO NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB We present a detailed study of a microwave single-photon source utilizing a transmon qubit asymmetrically coupled to two transmission lines: a weakly coupled drive line and a strongly coupled emission line. Our design allows for the generation of single photons in the microwave regime, which are essential for quantum communication, computing, and sensing applications. In addition to single-photon generation, the same design functions as a power sensor and enables precise measurement of the system's attenuation. This dual functionality allows us to calibrate the noise of our amplification chain. This enables a self-calibrated architecture in which the same device acts simultaneously as the photon source and as a reference standard, eliminating the need for external tones or calibrated inputs. With this calibration we reconstruct the density matrix of the emitted photon state, for which we achieve a fidelity of 61.4% and measure a second-order correlation function of g(2)(0)=0.06-0.06+0.45, indicating quantum nature and single-photon characteristics. These results confirm generation of single photons and demonstrate the potential of transmon qubits in advancing quantum technologies in the microwave domain.

TI Robust in practice: Adversarial attacks on quantum machine learning
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB State-of-the-art classical neural networks are observed to be vulnerable to small crafted adversarial perturbations. A more severe vulnerability has been noted for quantum machine learning (QML) models classifying Haar-random pure states. This stems from the concentration of measure phenomenon, a property of the metric space when sampled probabilistically, and is independent of the classification protocol. To provide insights into the adversarial robustness of a quantum classifier on real-world classification tasks, we focus on the adversarial robustness in classifying a subset of encoded states that are smoothly generated from a Gaussian latent space. We show that the vulnerability of this task is considerably weaker than that of classifying Haar-random pure states. In particular, we find only mildly polynomially decreasing robustness in the number of qubits, in contrast to the exponentially decreasing robustness when classifying Haar-random pure states and suggesting that QML models can be useful for real-world classification tasks.

AB Quantum entanglement describes superposition states in multi-dimensional systems-at least two partite-which cannot be factorized and are thus non-separable. Non-separable states also exist in classical theories involving vector spaces. In both cases, it is possible to violate a Bell-like inequality. This has led to controversial discussions, which we resolve by identifying an operational distinction between the classical and quantum cases.This article is part of the theme issue 'The quantum theory of light'.

AB The preservation of privacy is a critical concern in the implementation of artificial intelligence on sensitive training data. There are several techniques to preserve data privacy but quantum computations are inherently more secure due to the no-cloning theorem, resulting in a most desirable computational platform on top of the potential quantum advantages. There have been prior works in protecting data privacy by Quantum Federated Learning (QFL) and Quantum Differential Privacy (QDP) studied independently. However, to the best of our knowledge, no prior work has addressed both QFL and QDP together yet. Here, we propose to combine these privacy-preserving methods and implement them on the quantum platform, so that we can achieve comprehensive protection against data leakage (QFL) and model inversion attacks (QDP). This implementation promises more efficient and secure artificial intelligence. In this paper, we present a successful implementation of these privacy-preservation methods by performing the binary classification of the Cats vs Dogs dataset. Using our quantum-classical machine learning model, we obtained a test accuracy of over 0.98, while maintaining epsilon values less than 1.3. We show that federated differentially private training is a viable privacy preservation method for quantum machine learning on Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) devices.

TI Quantum Information Theory on Sparse Wave Functions and Applications for
   Quantum Chemistry
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY A
AB In recent years Quantum Computing prominently entered in the field of Computational Chemistry, importing and transforming computational methods and ideas originally developed within other disciplines, such as Physics, Mathematics and Computer Science into algorithms able to estimate quantum properties of atoms and molecules on present and future quantum devices. An important role in this contamination process is attributed to Quantum Information techniques, having the 2-fold role of contributing to the analysis of electron correlation and entanglements and guiding the construction of wave function variational ansatzes for the Variational Quantum Eigensolver technique. This paper introduces the tool SparQ (Sparse Quantum state analysis), designed to efficiently compute fundamental quantum information theory observables on post-Hartree-Fock wave functions sparse in their definition space. The core methodology involves mapping Fermionic wave functions to qubit space using Fermionic-to-qubits transformations and leveraging the sparse nature of these wave functions to evaluate observables and properties of the wave function. The effectiveness of SparQ is validated by analyzing the mutual information matrices of wave functions for the water molecule and the entropy of similar to 102 qubits describing the benzene molecule. This highlights its capability to handle large-scale quantum systems, limited mainly by the capabilities of quantum chemical methods used to retrieve the wave functions. The results indicate that quantum information theoretical analysis, so far limited to traditional tensor network methods and study of transition operators, can be applied to all post-Hartree-Fock wave functions, extending their applications to larger and more complex chemical systems.

AB The golden collision problem asks us to find a single, special collision among the outputs of a pseudorandom function. This generalizes meet-in-the-middle problems, and is thus applicable in many contexts, such as cryptanalysis of the NIST post-quantum candidate SIKE.
   The main quantum algorithms for this problem are memory-intensive, and the costs of quantum memory may be very high. The quantum circuit model implies a linear cost for random access, which annihilates the exponential advantage of the previous quantum collision-finding algorithms over Grover's algorithm or classical van Oorschot-Wiener.
   Assuming that quantum memory is costly to access but free to maintain, we provide new quantum algorithms for the golden collision problem with high memory requirements but low gate costs. Under the assumption of a two-dimensional connectivity layout, we provide better quantum parallelization methods for generic and golden collision finding. This lowers the quantum security of the golden collision and meet-in-the-middle problems, including SIKE.

TI Perfect and Quasi-Perfect Codes for the Bosonic Classical-Quantum
   Channel
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON QUANTUM ENGINEERING
AB In this article, we explore perfect and quasi-perfect codes for the Bosonic channel, where information is generated by a laser and conveyed in the form of coherent states. In particular, we consider the phase-modulation codebook for coherent states in a Bosonic channel. We show that these phase-modulation codes are quasi-perfect as long as the cardinality of the code is the same as the dimension of the coherent states. These codes feature the smallest error probability among all codes of the same cardinality and the same dimension of the channel Hilbert space. We study the performance of these codes in terms of error probability, incorporating the degradation caused by a depolarizing or an erasure quantum channel.

TI Optimised Multithreaded CV-QKD Reconciliation for Global Quantum
   Networks
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON COMMUNICATIONS
AB Designing a practical Continuous Variable (CV) Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) system requires an estimation of the quantum channel characteristics and the extraction of secure keys based on a large number of distributed quantum signals. On standard processors, it can take hours to reconcile the required number of quantum signals. This problem is exacerbated for Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellite CV-QKD, where the satellite flyover time is less than a few minutes. A potential solution is massive parallelisation of the classical reconciliation where a large-code block is subdivided into many shorter blocks for individual decoding. However, the penalty of this procedure on the important final secured key rate is non-trivial to determine and hitherto has not been formally analysed. In this work, we fill this important knowledge gap via detailed analyses and experimental verification of a CV-QKD sliced reconciliation protocol that uses large block-length low-density parity-check decoders. Our new solution results in a significant increase in the final key rate relative to non-optimised reconciliation. In addition, it allows for the acquisition of quantum secured messages between terrestrial stations and LEO satellites within a flyover timescale even using off-the-shelf processors. Our work allows for optimised global quantum networks secured via fundamental physics.

TI MIMO Terahertz Quantum Key Distribution Under Restricted Eavesdropping
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON QUANTUM ENGINEERING
AB Quantum key distribution (QKD) can provide unconditional security to next-generation communication networks guaranteed by the laws of quantum physics. This article studies the secret key rate (SKR) of a continuous variable QKD (CV-QKD) system using multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) transmission and operating at terahertz (THz) frequencies. Distinct from previous works, we consider a practical "restricted" eavesdropping scenario in which Eve can collect only a fraction of photons lost in the environment. We propose a system model for the MIMO THz CV-QKD system that accounts for restricted eavesdropping via a lossy wireless channel between Alice and Eve. We derive for this system new SKR expressions for both coherent-state-based and squeezed-state-based CV-QKD protocols. Our results show that previous analysis assuming unrestricted eavesdropping leads to overly pessimistic SKRs, and that in practice, the achievable SKR can be significantly increased under restricted eavesdropping. The increase in the SKR is quantified by the simplified SKR expansions derived in this article. Our results also reveal that squeezing is beneficial for improving the SKR only for unrestricted eavesdropping. However, in a practical setting with restricted eavesdropping, increased squeezing leads to a reduction in the SKR.

TI Boosted Ensembles of Qubit and Continuous Variable Quantum Support
   Vector Machines for B Meson Flavor Tagging
SO ADVANCED QUANTUM TECHNOLOGIES
AB The recent physical realization of quantum computers with hundreds of noisy qubits has given birth to an intense search for useful applications of their unique capabilities. One area that has received particular attention is quantum machine learning (QML), the study of machine learning algorithms running natively on quantum computers. In this work, QML methods are developed and applied to B meson flavor tagging, an important component of experiments which probe CP violation in order to better understand the matter-antimatter asymmetry of the universe. One simulate boosted ensembles of quantum support vector machines (QSVMs) based on both conventional qubit-based and continuous variable architectures, attaining effective tagging efficiencies of 28.0% and 29.2%, respectively, comparable with the leading published result of 30.0% using classical machine learning algorithms. The ensemble nature of the classifier is of particular importance, doubling the effective tagging efficiency of a single QSVM, which is find to be highly prone to overfitting. These results are obtained despite the constraint of working with QSVM architectures that are classically simulable, and it finds evidence that QSVMs beyond the simulable regime may be able to realize even higher performance, when sufficiently powerful quantum hardware is developed to execute them.

TI Quantum ergodicity and scrambling in quantum annealers
SO QUANTUM SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB Quantum annealers play a major role in the ongoing development of quantum information processing and in the advent of quantum technologies. Their functioning is underpinned by the many-body adiabatic evolution connecting the ground state of a simple system to that of an interacting classical Hamiltonian which encodes the solution to an optimization problem. Here we explore more general properties of the dynamics of quantum annealers, going beyond the low-energy regime. We show that the unitary evolution operator describing the complete dynamics is typically highly quantum chaotic. As a result, the annealing dynamics naturally leads to volume-law entangled random-like states when the initial configuration is rotated away from the low-energy subspace. Furthermore, we observe that the Heisenberg dynamics of a quantum annealer leads to extensive operator spreading, a hallmark of quantum information scrambling. In contrast, we find that when the annealing schedule is returned to the initial configuration (i.e. via a cyclic ramp), a subtle interplay between chaos and adiabaticity emerges, and the dynamics shows strong deviations from full ergodicity.

Solid-state spin defects, particularly nitrogen-vacancy centers in diamond, have emerged as promising platforms due to their long coherence time, optical addressability, high field sensitivity, and spatial and spectral resolution, making them ideal for sensing and imaging applications. Their compact size and robust performance under room temperature and ambient conditions further enhance their suitability for real-world applications. We provide an overview of quantum sensing principles and explore efforts to improve sensor functionality, including advanced sensing protocols, spatial imaging techniques, and integration with optical systems to enhance detection efficiency. We also highlight recent progress in the applications of these sensors across various use cases, including biomedical diagnostics, semiconductor device inspection, and industrial and military applications.

TI Quantum simulation of preferred tautomeric state prediction
SO NPJ QUANTUM INFORMATION
AB Prediction of tautomers plays an essential role in computer-aided drug discovery. However, it remains a challenging task nowadays to accurately predict the canonical tautomeric form of a given drug-like molecule. Lack of extensive tautomer databases, most likely due to the difficulty in experimental studies, hampers the development of effective empirical methods for tautomer predictions. A more accurate estimation of the stable tautomeric form can be achieved by quantum chemistry calculations. Yet, the computational cost required prevents quantum chemistry calculation as a standard tool for tautomer prediction in computer-aided drug discovery. In this paper we propose a hybrid quantum chemistry-quantum computation workflow to efficiently predict the dominant tautomeric form. Specifically, we select active-space molecular orbitals based on quantum chemistry methods. Then we utilize efficient encoding methods to map the Hamiltonian onto quantum devices to reduce the qubit resources and circuit depth. Finally, variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) algorithms are employed for ground state estimation where hardware-efficient ansatz circuits are used. To demonstrate the applicability of our methodology, we perform experiments on two tautomeric systems: acetone and Edaravone, each having 52 and 150 spin-orbitals in the Slater Type Orbital - 3 Gaussian (STO-3G) basis set, respectively. Our numerical results show that their tautomeric state prediction agrees with the Coupled Cluster Singles and Doubles (CCSD) benchmarks. Moreover, the required quantum resources are efficient: in the example of Edaravone, we could achieve chemical accuracy with only eight qubits and 80 two-qubit gates.

TI Generalized Toffoli Gate Decomposition Using Ququints: Towards Realizing
   Grover's Algorithm with Qudits
SO ENTROPY
AB Qubits, which are the quantum counterparts of classical bits, are used as basic information units for quantum information processing, whereas underlying physical information carriers, e.g., (artificial) atoms or ions, admit encoding of more complex multilevel states-qudits. Recently, significant attention has been paid to the idea of using qudit encoding as a way for further scaling quantum processors. In this work, we present an efficient decomposition of the generalized Toffoli gate on five-level quantum systems-so-called ququints-that use ququints' space as the space of two qubits with a joint ancillary state. The basic two-qubit operation we use is a version of the controlled-phase gate. The proposed N-qubit Toffoli gate decomposition has O(N) asymptotic depth and does not use ancillary qubits. We then apply our results for Grover's algorithm, where we indicate on the sizable advantage of using the qudit-based approach with the proposed decomposition in comparison to the standard qubit case. We expect that our results are applicable for quantum processors based on various physical platforms, such as trapped ions, neutral atoms, protonic systems, superconducting circuits, and others.

TI Solid-State Single-Photon Sources in Novel Materials: from Modulation to
   Integration (Invited)
SO LASER & OPTOELECTRONICS PROGRESS
AB Single-photon sources in solid-state materials are a class of quantum light source that generate single-photon radiation through point defects or excitons in solid-state materials. Due to advantages such as high stability, ease of operation, high integrability, and high efficiency, the single-photon source has a wide application prospect in fields such as quantum information processing, quantum sensing, and quantum optics. First, the research systematically classifies different types of single-photon sources in novel solid-state materials, compares their respective advantages and limitations. Furthermore, it focuses on common strategies for modulating the performance of single-photon sources, such as strain engineering, temperature control, electric field tuning, and surface plasmon coupling. Additionally, the latest progress and challenges in integrating single-photon sources in novel solid-state materials into photonic chips are discussed, along with application examples in quantum communication, quantum computing, and quantum key distribution. Finally, current issues and future development directions in this research field are summarized, aiming to provide a comprehensive and concise overview of single-photon sources in novel solid-state materials.

TI Intramolecular Pnictogen Bonds as Key Determinants for NMR Quantum
   Computation Parameters
SO ACS OMEGA
AB In this work, four molecules, two naphthalene derivatives and two acenaphthene derivatives, were studied via DFT for their ability to act as a quantum bit (qubit) for transferring information for NMR quantum computational information (QIP). NMR calculations indicate that all four molecules are suitable as qubits. Additionally, AIM, NBO, and EDA analyses provided insights into the presence and nature of intramolecular interactions between key atoms relevant to NMR-QIP. The results suggest that these P-P or P-Se interactions correspond to pnictogen bonds (PnB) in three compounds and to the chalcogen bond in the other compound, with most of their interaction energy originating from orbital interactions. To investigate the role of PnB in NMR parameters, the P-P interaction was modified to either increase or decrease its interaction energy. AIM and EDA analyses, combined with NMR calculations, reveal that as the interaction strengthens the NMR parameters become more suitable for NMR-QIP. Additionally, the results confirm that orbital interactions remain the primary contributor to the interaction energy. In summary, the findings of this study highlight the relationship between intramolecular pnictogen interactions and NMR parameters in four compounds, with potential applications in quantum information processing.

TI Photovoltaic power forecasting using quantum machine learning
SO SOLAR ENERGY
AB Accurate forecasting of photovoltaic power is essential for reliable grid integration, yet remains difficult due to highly variable irradiance, complex meteorological drivers, site geography, and device-specific behavior. Although contemporary machine learning has achieved successes, it is not clear that these approaches are optimal: new model classes may further enhance performance and data efficiency. We investigate hybrid quantum neural networks for time-series forecasting of photovoltaic power and introduce two architectures. The first, a Hybrid Quantum Long Short-Term Memory model, reduces mean absolute error and mean squared error by more than 40% relative to the strongest baselines evaluated. The second, a Hybrid Quantum Sequence-to-Sequence model, once trained, it predicts power for arbitrary forecast horizons without requiring prior meteorological inputs and achieves a 16% lower mean absolute error than the best baseline on this task. Both hybrid models maintain superior accuracy when training data are limited, indicating improved data efficiency. These results show that hybrid quantum models address key challenges in photovoltaic power forecasting and offer a practical route to more reliable, data-efficient energy predictions.

TI Simulating two-dimensional topological quantum phase transitions on a
   digital quantum computer
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Efficient preparation of many-body ground states is key to harnessing the power of quantum computers in studying quantum many-body systems. In this work, we propose a simple method to design exact linear-depth parameterized quantum circuits which prepare a family of ground states across topological quantum phase transitions in 2D. We achieve this by constructing ground states represented by isometric tensor networks (isoTNS), which form a subclass of tensor network states that are efficiently preparable. By continuously tuning a parameter in the wavefunction, the many-body ground state undergoes quantum phase transitions, exhibiting distinct 2D quantum phases. We illustrate this by constructing an isoTNS path with bond dimension D = 2 interpolating between distinct symmetry-enriched topological (SET) phases. At the transition point, the wavefunction is related to a gapless point in the classical six-vertex model. Furthermore, the critical wavefunction supports a power-law correlation along one spatial direction while remaining long-range ordered in the other spatial direction. We provide an explicit parametrized local quantum circuit for the path and show that the 2D isoTNS can also be efficiently simulated by a holographic quantum algorithm requiring only an 1D array of qubits.

TI Inequality constraints in variational quantum circuits with qudits
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Quantum optimization is emerging as a prominent candidate for exploiting the capabilities of near-term quantum devices. Many application-relevant optimization tasks require the inclusion of inequality constraints, usually handled by enlarging the Hilbert space through the addition of slack variables. This approach, however, requires significant additional resources especially when considering multiple constraints. Here, we study an alternative direct implementation of these constraints within the quantum approximate optimization algorithm, achieved using qudit-sum gates, and compare it to the slack variable method generalized to qudits. We benchmark these approaches on three paradigmatic optimization problems. We find that the direct implementation of the inequality penalties vastly outperforms the slack variables method, especially when studying real-world inspired problems with many constraints. Within the direct penalty implementation, a linear energy penalty for unfeasible states outperforms other investigated functional forms, such as the canonical quadratic penalty. The proposed approach may thus be an enabling step for approaching realistic industry-scale and fundamental science problems with large numbers of inequality constraints.

TI Query complexity of classical and quantum channel discrimination
SO QUANTUM SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB Quantum channel discrimination has been studied from an information-theoretic perspective, wherein one is interested in the optimal decay rate of error probabilities as a function of the number of unknown channel accesses. In this paper, we study the query complexity of quantum channel discrimination, wherein the goal is to determine the minimum number of channel uses needed to reach a desired error probability. To this end, we show that the query complexity of binary channel discrimination depends logarithmically on the inverse error probability and inversely on the negative logarithm of the (geometric and Holevo) channel fidelity. As special cases of these findings, we precisely characterize the query complexity of discriminating two classical channels and two classical-quantum channels. Furthermore, by obtaining an optimal characterization of the sample complexity of quantum hypothesis testing when the error probability does not exceed a fixed threshold, we provide a more precise characterization of query complexity under a similar error probability threshold constraint. We also provide lower and upper bounds on the query complexity of binary asymmetric channel discrimination and multiple quantum channel discrimination. For the former, the query complexity depends on the geometric R & eacute;nyi and Petz-R & eacute;nyi channel divergences, while for the latter, it depends on the negative logarithm of the (geometric and Uhlmann) channel fidelity. For multiple channel discrimination, the upper bound scales as the logarithm of the number of channels.

TI QUANTUM COMPUTING ALGORITHMS FOR INVERSE PROBLEMS ON GRAPHS AND AN
   NP-COMPLETE INVERSE PROBLEM
SO INVERSE PROBLEMS AND IMAGING
AB We consider an inverse problem for a finite graph ( X, E ) where we are given a subset of vertices B subset of X and the distances d ( X,E ) ( b 1 , b 2 ) between all pairs of vertices b 1 , b 2 is an element of B . The distance between vertices x 1 , x 2 is an element of X is defined as the minimal number of edges in paths connecting the vertices. This problem can be regarded as a discrete version of the boundary rigidity problem in Riemannian geometry or the inverse travel time problem in geophysics. We develop quantum computing methods to find a solution to the problem, and show that the solution is unique under certain conditions. We prove the following uniqueness result: when ( X, E ) is a tree and B is the set of leaves of the tree, the graph ( X, E ) is uniquely determined in the class of all connected graphs having a fixed number of vertices. We present a quantum algorithm which, under arbitrary conditions, produces the graph ( X, E ), or one of those, which has the given number of vertices and the required distances between vertices in B . To this end we develop an algorithm that takes in a qubit representation of a graph and combine it with Grover's search algorithm. The algorithm can be implemented using only O ( | X | 2 ) qubits, the same order as the number of elements in the adjacency matrix of ( X, E ), and it has a quadratic improvement in computational cost compared to standard classical algorithms. Finally, we consider applications in the theory of computation, and show that a slight modification of the inverse problem above is NP-complete: all NP-problems can be reduced to a discrete inverse problem that we consider.

TI Thermal quantum coherence of two-qutrit Heisenberg XXZ model with
   Herring-Flicker coupling and Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction under
   magnetic field
SO PHYSICA SCRIPTA
AB In this study, we use the concept of l(1)-norm coherence to characterize the entanglement of a two-qutrit Heisenberg XXZ model for subject to a uniform magnetic field and z-axis Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction with Herring-Flicker coupling. We show that the temperature, magnetic field, DM interaction, and distance of Herring-Flicker coupling can all control the entanglement. However, the state system becomes less entangled at high temperatures or strong magnetic fields and vice versa. Our findings suggest that entanglement rises when the z-axis DM interaction increases. Additionally, we show that plateau behavior in the entanglement between spins (1, 1) occurs in the XXZ Heisenberg spin system and is influenced by the magnetic field, demonstrating that thermal agitation can weaken entanglement plateaus. Moreover, by setting the strengths coupling of the spin, we quickly recover the isotropic XY and XXX Heisenberg models. Finally, Herring-Flicker coupling affects the degree of entanglement. When Herring-Flicker coupling and temperature are at small values, the degree of entanglement is at its highest. Still, when Herring-Flicker coupling is at substantial values, the degree of entanglement tends to stabilize.

TI Entanglement Routing in Quantum Networks: A Comprehensive Survey
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON QUANTUM ENGINEERING
AB Entanglement routing in near-term quantum networks consists of choosing the optimal sequence of short-range entanglements to combine through swapping operations to establish end-to-end entanglement between two distant nodes. Similar to traditional routing technologies, a quantum routing protocol uses network information to choose the best paths to satisfy a set of end-to-end entanglement requests. However, in addition to network state information, a quantum routing protocol must also take into account the requested entanglement fidelity, the probabilistic nature of swapping operations, and the short lifetime of entangled states. In this work, we formulate a practical entanglement routing problem and analyze and categorize the main approaches to address it, drawing comparisons to, and inspiration from, classical network routing strategies where applicable. We classify and discuss the studied quantum routing schemes into reactive, proactive, and hybrid routing.

TI Linearized quantum lattice-Boltzmann method for the advection-diffusion
   equation using dynamic circuits
SO COMPUTER PHYSICS COMMUNICATIONS
AB We propose a quantum algorithm for the linear advection-diffusion equation (ADE) Lattice-Boltzmann method (LBM) that leverages dynamic circuits. Dynamic quantum circuits allow for an optimized quantum collision operator algorithm by incorporating partial measurements as an integral step. The quantum circuit efficiently adapts during execution based on digital information obtained via mid-circuit measurements. The proposed new collision algorithm is implemented as a fully unitary operator, which facilitates the computation of multiple time steps without state reinitialization. Unlike previous quantum collision operators that rely on linear combinations of unitaries, the proposed algorithm does not exhibit a probabilistic failure rate. Our proposed algorithm embeds no more than two distribution functions simultaneously within the quantum state, irrespective of the velocity set. Compared to previous quantum algorithms, this approach reduces both the qubit overhead and circuit complexity required to execute the collision operator and encode the distributions. The quantum collision algorithm is validated against classical LBM simulations in 1D and 2D, showing excellent agreement. Performance analysis over multiple time steps highlights advantages of the proposed method compared to previous methods. As an additional variant, a hybrid quantum-digital approach is proposed, which reduces the number of mid-circuit measurements, thus improving the efficiency of the quantum collision algorithm.

TI Quantum Surface Topological Code for Bell State Stabilization in
   Superconducting Physical Qubit Systems
SO MATHEMATICS
AB Stabilizing quantum states in physical qubits quantum computers has been a widely explored topic in the Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum era. However, much of this work has focused on simulation rather than practical implementation. In this study, an experimental advancement in Bell state stabilization is presented, which utilizes surface codes for quantum error correction across three quantum computers: ibm_fez, ibm_torino, and ibm_brisbane. Our findings indicate that error correction produces an improvement of approximately 3% in accuracy for 127-qubit systems while demonstrating a more significant enhancement of around 20% for 156-qubit systems in stabilizing the Bell state with fidelity up to 0.6 in all the experiments. This paper outlines the methodology for implementing this strategy in other applications, offering a pathway to improve results (approximate to 20%) when experimenting with superconducting quantum computers.

That is, given a code and an erasure error we give a recipe to explicitly compute the terms in the RT formula. Using this formalism, we employ quantum circuits to construct a number of examples of holographic codes. Our codes have nontrivial holographic properties and are simpler than existing approaches built on tensor networks. Finally, leveraging a connection between correctable and private systems we prove the uniqueness of the algebra satisfying complementary recovery. The material is presented with the goal of accessibility to researchers in quantum information with no prior background in holography.

TI Enhancing hierarchical remote preparation of an arbitrary n-qudit
   equatorial state by weak measurement and measurement reversal
SO PHYSICA SCRIPTA
AB Based on the demand for safer and more efficient quantum network communication, we propose two deterministic protocols to achieve the remote preparation of an arbitrary n-qudit equatorial states among multiple agents by selecting appropriate entanglement resources. The level of the agents varies depending on their authorities to restore the secret state. The superior agent requires the cooperation of the residual superior agents and any one of the subordinate agents, while the subordinate agent needs the help of all the other agents. To be emphasized, the recovery operations are deduced by general formulas that distinctly elucidate their relevance with the measurement outcomes. Additionally, we discuss the impact of amplitude damping noise and utilize weak measurement and measurement reversal to suppress noise.

SO PRX QUANTUM
AB Individual trapped atomic qubits represent one of the most promising technologies to scale quantum computers, owing to their low idle errors and the ability to implement a full set of reconfigurable gate operations via focused optical fields. However, the fidelity of quantum gate operations can be limited by weak confinement of the atoms transverse to the laser. We present measurements of this effect by performing individually addressed entangling gates in chains of up to 25 trapped atomic ions. We present a semiclassical model that accurately describes the observed decoherence from the residual heating of the ions caused by noisy electric fields. We suppress these effects by cotrapping ancilla ions for sympathetically cooling the qubit ions throughout a quantum circuit.

While traditionally nonlocality deals with spacelike separated parties, this question becomes important with quantum technologies that connect devices by means of small shared systems. Here, we study Bell inequalities where measurements of different parties can have overlap. This allows us to accommodate problems in quantum information such as the existence of quantum error correction codes in the framework of nonlocality. The scenarios considered show an interesting behavior with respect to Hilbert space dimension, overlap, and symmetry.

TI Digital Quantum Simulation of Scalar Yukawa Coupling
SO QUANTUM REPORTS
AB Motivated by the revitalized interest in the digital simulation of medium- and high-energy physics phenomena, we investigate the dynamics following a Yukawa interaction quench on IBM Q. Adopting the zero-dimensional version of the scalar Yukawa coupling model as our point of departure, we design low-depth quantum circuits, emulating its dynamics with up to three bosons. In the one-boson case, we demonstrate circuit compression, i.e., a constant-depth circuit containing only two controlled-NOT (CNOT) gates. In the more complex three-boson case, we design a circuit in which one Trotter step entails eight CNOTs. Using an analogy with the traveling salesman problem, we also provide a CNOT cost estimate for higher boson number truncations. Based on these circuits, we quantify the system dynamics by evaluating the expected boson number at an arbitrary time after the quench and the survival probability of the initial vacuum state (the Loschmidt echo). We also utilize these circuits to drive adiabatic transitions and compute the energies of the ground- and first-excited states of the considered model. Finally, through error mitigation, i.e., zero-noise extrapolation, we demonstrate the good agreement of our results with a numerically exact classical benchmark.

TI Shor-Laflamme distributions of graph states and noise robustness of
   entanglement
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICS A-MATHEMATICAL AND THEORETICAL
AB The Shor-Laflamme distribution (SLD) of a quantum state is a collection of local unitary invariants that quantify k-body correlations. We show that the SLD of graph states can be derived by solving a graph-theoretical problem. In this way, the mean and variance of the SLD are obtained as simple functions of efficiently computable graph properties. Furthermore, this formulation enables us to derive closed expressions of SLDs for some graph state families. For cluster states, we observe that the SLD is very similar to a binomial distribution, and we argue that this property is typical for graph states in general. Finally, we derive an SLD-based entanglement criterion from the purity criterion and apply it to derive meaningful noise thresholds for entanglement. Our new entanglement criterion is easy to use and also applies to the case of higher-dimensional qudits. In the bigger picture, our results foster the understanding both of quantum error-correcting codes, where a closely related notion of SLDs plays an important role, and of the geometry of quantum states, where SLDs are known as sector length distributions.

SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Due to their long coherence times, nuclear spins have gained considerable attention as physical qubits. Two-qubit gates between nuclear spins of distinct resonance frequencies can be mediated by electron spins, usually employing a sequence of electron-nuclear gates. Here we present a different approach inspired by, but not limited to, NV centers in diamond and discuss possible applications. To this end we generalize external electron spin control sequences for nuclear spin initialization and hyperpolarization to achieve the simultaneous control of distinct nuclear spins via an electron spin. This approach results in efficient entangling gates that, compared to standard techniques, reduce the gate time by more than 50% when the gate time is limited by off-resonant coupling to other spins and by up to 22% when the gate time is limited by small electron-nuclear coupling.

One of these advances has centered around the development of driver Hamiltonians that commute with the constraints of an optimization problem-allowing for another avenue to satisfying those constraints instead of imposing penalty terms for each of them. In particular, the approach is able to use sparser connectivity to embed several practical problems on quantum devices in comparison to the standard approach of using penalty terms. However, designing the driver Hamiltonians that successfully commute with several constraints has largely been based on strong intuition for specific problems and with no simple general algorithm for generating them for arbitrary constraints. In this work, we develop a simple and intuitive algebraic framework for reasoning about the commutation of Hamiltonians with linear constraints-one that allows us to classify the complexity of finding a driver Hamiltonian for an arbitrary set of linear constraints as NP-complete. Because unitary operators are exponentials of Hermitian operators, these results can also be applied to the construction of mixers in the quantum alternating operator ansatz framework.

TI Efficient quantum gate teleportation in higher dimensions
SO PROCEEDINGS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY A-MATHEMATICAL PHYSICAL AND ENGINEERING
   SCIENCES
AB The Clifford hierarchy is a nested sequence of sets of quantum gates critical to achieving fault-tolerant quantum computation. Diagonal gates of the Clifford hierarchy and 'nearly diagonal' semi-Clifford gates are particularly important: they admit efficient gate teleportation protocols that implement these gates with fewer ancillary quantum resources such as magic states. Despite the practical importance of these sets of gates, many questions about their structure remain open; this is especially true in the higher-dimensional qudit setting. Our contribution is to leverage the discrete Stone-von Neumann theorem and the symplectic formalism of qudit stabilizer theory towards extending the results of Zeng et al. (2008) and Beigi & Shor (2010) to higher dimensions in a uniform manner. We further give a simple algorithm for recursively enumerating all gates of the Clifford hierarchy, a simple algorithm for recognizing and diagonalizing semi-Clifford gates, and a concise proof of the classification of the diagonal Clifford hierarchy gates due to Cui et al. (2016) for the single-qudit case. We generalize the efficient gate teleportation protocols of semi-Clifford gates to the qudit setting and prove that every third-level gate of one qudit (of any prime dimension) and of two qutrits can be implemented efficiently. Numerical evidence gathered via the aforementioned algorithms supports the conjecture that higher-level gates can be implemented efficiently.

TI Order-disorder phase transitions of phosphorene and their application to
   adiabatic quantum computing
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB Phosphorene monolayers exhibit a range of advanced functional properties; however, their spin configurations and structural phase transitions remain unexplored in the context of enhancing performance in quantum computation and information. In this study, we employ a two-dimensional (2D) Ising model with nearest- and next-nearest-neighbor interactions, denoted as J and J ' respectively, alongside a Monte Carlo approach, to investigate the structural phase transitions and spin behavior of phosphorene. Using this model, we derive the temperature-dependent phase diagram of the phosphorene in terms of the interaction strength ratio (J/J '), revealing three distinct phases-checkerboard-ordered, glassy, and quasi-ordered-with a phase boundary at J/J ' = 2. Additionally, we analyze the effects of possible defects and strains in the phosphorene lattice induced by the substrate on the phase transitions. Our findings have potential applications in adiabatically switching states through gradual variations in coupling constants, offering new possibilities for adiabatic quantum computing (AQC) and pi-ring arrays.

TI Quantum-Enhanced Representation Learning: A Quanvolutional Autoencoder
   Approach against DDoS Threats
SO MACHINE LEARNING AND KNOWLEDGE EXTRACTION
AB Motivated by the growing threat of distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks and the emergence of quantum computing, this study introduces a novel "quanvolutional autoencoder" architecture for learning representations. The architecture leverages the computational advantages of quantum mechanics to improve upon traditional machine learning techniques. Specifically, the quanvolutional autoencoder employs randomized quantum circuits to analyze time-series data from DDoS attacks, offering a robust alternative to classical convolutional neural networks. Experimental results suggest that the quanvolutional autoencoder performs similarly to classical models in visualizing and learning from DDoS hive plots and leads to faster convergence and learning stability. These findings suggest that quantum machine learning holds significant promise for advancing data analysis and visualization in cybersecurity. The study highlights the need for further research in this fast-growing field, particularly for unsupervised anomaly detection.

TI A Teleportation Protocol Variant for Single-QPU Benchmarking
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB With the advent of more quantum computing applications, it is imperative to provide developers with a set of metrics to determine how much trust they can place in the execution of their programs. In this study, we propose a variation of the quantum teleportation to systematically evaluate the performance of quantum circuits and quantify their execution reliability. Our protocol consists of three parts: the payload, composed of entangled qubits with random gates applied to each wire; the bridge, which corresponds to the teleportation-inspired protocol; and an inverse payload operation, designed to return the circuit to its initial state. We validated the algorithm by elaborating its mathematical framework, followed by a comparative analysis with simulation results using Qiskit AerSimulator and ultimately through an execution on the IBM quantum and Rigetti services. A key aspect of our methodology was to set the circuit transpilation to its lowest optimization level (level 0). We recognize that even without aggressive optimization, randomly generated gates can form self-canceling sequences. As a result, our analysis correlated the pre-runtime metrics of the final, minimally-transpiled circuit (such as its actual depth and gate count) with post-runtime results (such as success rate). This approach reveals significant correlations and offers developers quantitative metrics to assess both the reliability of quantum circuit execution and scalability limitations in their applications.

TI Fully on-chip photonic turnkey quantum source for entangled qubit/qudit
   state generation
SO NATURE PHOTONICS
AB Integrated photonics has recently become a leading platform for the realization and processing of optical entangled quantum states in compact, robust and scalable chip formats, with applications in long-distance quantum-secured communication, quantum-accelerated information processing and nonclassical metrology. However, the quantum light sources developed so far have relied on external bulky excitation lasers, making them impractical prototype devices that are not reproducible, hindering their scalability and transfer out of the laboratory into real-world applications. Here we demonstrate a fully integrated quantum light source that overcomes these challenges through the integration of a laser cavity, a highly efficient tunable noise suppression filter (>55 dB) exploiting the Vernier effect, and a nonlinear microring for entangled photon-pair generation through spontaneous four-wave mixing. The hybrid quantum source employs an electrically pumped InP gain section and a Si3N4 low-loss microring filter system, and demonstrates high performance parameters, that is, pair emission over four resonant modes in the telecom band (bandwidth of similar to 1 THz) and a remarkable pair detection rate of similar to 620 Hz at a high coincidence-to-accidental ratio of similar to 80. The source directly creates high-dimensional frequency-bin entangled quantum states (qubits/qudits), as verified by quantum interference measurements with visibilities up to 96% (violating Bell's inequality) and by density matrix reconstruction through state tomography, showing fidelities of up to 99%. Our approach, leveraging a hybrid photonic platform, enables scalable, commercially viable, low-cost, compact, lightweight and field-deployable entangled quantum sources, quintessential for practical, out-of-laboratory applications such as in quantum processors and quantum satellite communications systems.

TI Integration of Webots and Qiskit for experimentation with quantum
   circuits as robotic controllers
SO MEMORIA INVESTIGACIONES EN INGENIERIA
AB Currently, two areas of technological and economic importance have experienced significant and accelerated advances: robotics and computing. In the latter case, research into the quantum approach has been remarkable. In relation to robotics, the Webots robotic simulator has been used in the research and implementation of robots in real environments and allows the simulated system to be manipulated by controllers written in the Python programming language. This allows interaction with other environments and systems programmed in the same language. Within this premise, we have experimented with the implementation of robotic controllers using quantum circuits programmed in the Qiskit programming platform. All this has been carried out in the Webots simulation environment. Effects such as ideal random number generation from quantum events, entanglement and superposition provide possibilities for simulation, learning and research in both areas. In this paper we show an approach to these quantum controllers. The progress achieved and some possibilities for future work are presented.

TI Unveiling the Non-Abelian Statistics of D(S3) Anyons Using a Classical
   Photonic Simulator
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB Simulators can realize novel phenomena by separating them from the complexities of a full physical implementation. Here, we put forward a scheme that can simulate the exotic statistics of D(S3) nonAbelian anyons with minimal resources. The qudit lattice representation of this planar code supports local encoding of D(S3) anyons. As a proof-of-principle demonstration, we employ a classical photonic simulator to encode a single qutrit and manipulate it to perform the fusion and braiding properties of nonAbelian D(S3) anyons. The photonic technology allows us to perform the required nonunitary operations with much higher fidelity than what can be achieved with current quantum computers. Our approach can be directly generalized to larger systems or to different anyonic models, thus enabling advances in the exploration of quantum error correction and fundamental physics alike.

TI Simulation and Application Purpose of a Randomized Secret Key with
   Quantum Key Distribution
SO ELECTRICAL CONTROL AND COMMUNICATION ENGINEERING
AB The Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) is a well-researched secure communication method for exchanging cryptographic keys only known by the shared participants. The vulnerable problem of a secret key distribution is the negotiation and the transfer over an insecure or untrusted channel. Novel further developments of the QKD communication method are part of in-field technologies and applications in communication devices, such as satellites. However, expensive physical test setups are necessary to improve new application possibilities of cryptographic protocol involving components of quantum mechanics and quantum laws of physics. Therefore, optical simulation software can play a part in essential QKD simulating and further developing quantum-based cryptosystems. In the paper, the authors consider a feasible QKD setup based on the BB84 protocol to create a symmetric key material based on achieving a linear key rate via optical simulation software. The paper still provides two experimental architecture designs to use the QKD for a cryptosystem.

TI Quantum Machine Learning Architecture for COVID-19 Classification Based
   on Synthetic Data Generation Using Conditional Adversarial Neural
   Network
SO COGNITIVE COMPUTATION
AB Background COVID-19 is a novel virus that affects the upper respiratory tract, as well as the lungs. The scale of the global COVID-19 pandemic, its spreading rate, and deaths are increasing regularly. Computed tomography (CT) scans can be used carefully to detect and analyze COVID-19 cases. In CT images/scans, ground-glass opacity (GGO) is found in the early stages of infection. While in later stages, there is a superimposed pulmonary consolidation. Methods This research investigates the quantum machine learning (QML) and classical machine learning (CML) approaches for the analysis of COVID-19 images. The recent developments in quantum computing have led researchers to explore new ideas and approaches using QML. The proposed approach consists of two phases: in phase I, synthetic CT images are generated through the conditional adversarial network (CGAN) to increase the size of the dataset for accurate training and testing. In phase II, the classification of COVID-19/healthy images is performed, in which two models are proposed: CML and QML. Result The proposed model achieved 0.94 precision (Pn), 0.94 accuracy (Ac), 0.94 recall (Rl), and 0.94 F1-score (Fe) on POF Hospital dataset while 0.96 Pn, 0.96 Ac, 0.95 Rl, and 0.96 Fe on UCSD-AI4H dataset. Conclusion The proposed method achieved better results when compared to the latest published work in this domain.

TI Theory of qubit noise characterization using the long-time cavity
   transmission
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Noise-induced decoherence is one of the main threats to large-scale quantum computation. In an attempt to assess the noise affecting a qubit, we go beyond the standard steady-state solution of the transmission through a qubit-coupled cavity in input-output theory by including dynamical noise in the description of the system. We solve the quantum Langevin equations exactly for a noise-free system and treat the noise as a perturbation. In the long-time limit the corrections may be written as a sum of convolutions of the noise power spectral density with an integration kernel that depends on external control parameters. Using the convolution theorem, we invert the corrections and obtain relations for the noise spectral density as an integral over measurable quantities. Additionally, we treat the noise exactly in the dispersive regime and again find that noise characteristics are imprinted in the long-time transmission in convolutions containing the power spectral density.

TI Causal influence versus signaling for interacting quantum channels
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB A causal relation between quantum agents, say Alice and Bob, is necessarily mediated by an interaction. Modeling the latter as a reversible quantum channel, an intervention of Alice can have causal influence on Bob's system, modifying correlations between Alice and Bob's systems. Causal influence between quantum systems necessarily allows for signaling. Here we prove a mismatch between causal influence and signaling via direct computation of the two quantities for the Cnot gate. Finally we show a continuity theorem for causal effects of unitary channels: a channel has small causal influence if it allows for small signaling.

TI A Polynomial-Time Classical Algorithm for Noisy Quantum Circuits
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW X
AB We provide a polynomial-time classical algorithm for noisy quantum circuits. The algorithm computes the expectation value of any observable for any circuit, with a small average error over input states drawn from an ensemble (e.g., the computational basis). Our approach is based upon the intuition that noise exponentially damps nonlocal correlations relative to local correlations. This enables one to classically simulate a noisy quantum circuit by keeping track of only the dynamics of local quantum information. Our algorithm also enables sampling from the output distribution of a circuit in quasipolynomial time, so long as the distribution anticoncentrates. A number of implications are discussed, including a fundamental limit on the efficacy of noise mitigation strategies: For constant noise rates, any quantum circuit for which error mitigation succeeds in polynomial-time on most input states can also be classically simulated in polynomial-time on most input states. Our algorithms scale exponentially in the inverse noise rate, which is fundamental and makes them impractical for current quantum devices.

Since the state of the lattice gas is determined by Boolean variables, 0 (absence) or 1 (presence), in LGA, it is well suited for implementation in quantum annealing and simulated annealing computers. The quantum annealing -based algorithm proposed in this study is constructed so that conservation of mass and momentum is satisfied at the particle collision process. Verification tests performed with various quantum annealing and simulated annealing computers confirm that the proposed algorithm well replicates a conventional LGA collision model.

TI Influence of snowfall on free-space quantum channel near earth surface
   and parameter simulation
SO ACTA PHYSICA SINICA
AB Quantum communication has the advantages of wide coverage and security, and is currently a hot research topic in the field of communication. In the process of free space quantum communication, quantum signals need transmitting at a certain height above the surface. Various environmental factors in free space, such as snowfall, sandstorms, rainfall, haze and floating dust, will inevitably affect quantum communication performance. However, so far, the influence of snowfall on the performance of quantum channels in free space near the surface has not been investigated. Thus, according to the intensity of snowfall, the snowfall is divided into four levels: light snow (S-1), medium snow (S-2), heavy snow (S-3) and blizzard (S-1). When the snow is falling in the air, it has an energy absorption effect on the light quantum signal, which is called the extinction effect. The different intensities of snow extinction have different effects on free space optical quantum signal. In this paper, first, a mathematical model for the extinction effects on optical quantum signal at different levels of snowfall is presented; then the quantitative relationship between snowfall and free space extinction attenuation, as well as the relationship between snowfall and channel limit survival function is established, channel capacities under different snowfall intensities, and quantum bit error rate are also given. Finally, the mathematical models of snowfall intensity, transmission distance and link attenuation, amplitude damping channel capacity, channel survival function and channel error rate are established. Simulation results show that when the snowfall intensity is 2.1 mm/d(S-1) and the transmission distance is 2.2 km, the communication link attenuation is 0.0362, the channel capacity is 0.7745, the channel survival function is 0.2329, and the channel error rate is 0.0105. When the snowfall intensity is 3.8 mm/d (S-2) and the transmission distance is 3.5 km, the communication link attenuation is 0.1326, the channel capacity is 0.4922, the channel survival function is 0.2099, and the channel error rate is 0.019. Thus, different snowfall intensity has different influence on the performance of free space quantum communication. Therefore, in practical applications, the communication parameters should be adjusted adaptively based on the snowfall intensity to improve the reliability of free space quantum communication.

TI Improved Superconducting Qubit State Readout by Path Interference
SO CHINESE PHYSICS LETTERS
AB High fidelity single shot qubit state readout is essential for many quantum information processing protocols. In superconducting quantum circuit, the qubit state is usually determined by detecting the dispersive frequency shift of a microwave cavity from either transmission or reflection. We demonstrate the use of constructive interference between the transmitted and reflected signal to optimize the qubit state readout, with which we find a better resolved state discrimination and an improved qubit readout fidelity. As a simple and convenient approach, our scheme can be combined with other qubit readout methods based on the discrimination of cavity photon states to further improve the qubit state readout.

TI Streamlined quantum computing with macronode cluster states
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Continuous-variable cluster states allow for fault-tolerant measurement-based quantum computing when used in tandem with the Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill (GKP) encoding of a qubit into a bosonic mode. For quad-raillattice macronode cluster states, whose construction is defined by a fixed, low-depth beam splitter network, we show that a Clifford gate and GKP error correction can be simultaneously implemented in a single teleportation step. We give explicit recipes to realize the Clifford generating set, and we calculate the logical gate-error rates given finite squeezing in the cluster-state and GKP resources. We find that logical error rates of 10(-2)-10(-3), compatible with the thresholds of topological codes, can be achieved with squeezing of 11.9-13.7 dB. The protocol presented eliminates noise present in prior schemes and puts the required squeezing for fault tolerance in the range of current state-of-the-art optical experiments. Finally, we show how to produce distillable GKP magic states directly within the cluster state.

TI Linear growth of quantum circuit complexity
SO NATURE PHYSICS
AB The dynamics of quantum states underlies the emergence of thermodynamics and even recent theories of quantum gravity. Now it has been proven that the quantum complexity of states evolving under random operations grows linearly in time.
   The complexity of quantum states has become a key quantity of interest across various subfields of physics, from quantum computing to the theory of black holes. The evolution of generic quantum systems can be modelled by considering a collection of qubits subjected to sequences of random unitary gates. Here we investigate how the complexity of these random quantum circuits increases by considering how to construct a unitary operation from Haar-random two-qubit quantum gates. Implementing the unitary operation exactly requires a minimal number of gates-this is the operation's exact circuit complexity. We prove a conjecture that this complexity grows linearly, before saturating when the number of applied gates reaches a threshold that grows exponentially with the number of qubits. Our proof overcomes difficulties in establishing lower bounds for the exact circuit complexity by combining differential topology and elementary algebraic geometry with an inductive construction of Clifford circuits.

TI Impact of parity violation on quantum entanglement and Bell nonlocality
SO EUROPEAN PHYSICAL JOURNAL C
AB We present our new findings on how various fundamental interactions decisively shape quantum entanglement and the Bell measure within and beyond the quantum field theory (QFT). In QFT, parity symmetry plays a key role in determining entanglement. Parity-conserving interactions produce maximally entangled bipartite systems, while maximally parity-violating interactions result in disentangled bipartite systems, placing the Bell measure on the boundary between classical and quantum theories. By examining the relation between quantum entanglement and Bell measure, we find that clean signals for interactions beyond QFT may be obtained. We propose methods to test these potential signals. Furthermore, we highlight the previously overlooked influence of magnetic fields within detectors, which radically alters predictions for quantum entanglement and Bell nonlocality. This environmental effect induces spurious P and charge-parity (CP) violations, which has to be carefully accounted for to reveal the true P, CP, and Bell nonlocality effects.

TI Efficiency of Feynman's quantum computer
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Feynman's circuit-to-Hamiltonian construction enables the mapping of a quantum circuit to a time- independent Hamiltonian. This model introduces a Hilbert space made from an ancillary clock register tracking the progress of the computation. In this paper, we explore the efficiency, or run time, of a quantum computer that directly implements the clock system. This relates to the model's probability of computation completion which we investigate at an established optimal time for an arbitrary number of gates k. The relationship between the run time of the model and the number of gates is obtained both numerically and analytically to be O(k5/3). In principle, this is significantly more efficient than the well-investigated Feynman-Kitaev model of adiabatic quantum computation with a run time of O(k4). We address the challenge which stems from the small window that exists to capture the optimal stopping time, after which there are rapid oscillations of decreasing probability amplitude. We establish a relationship for the time difference between the first and second maximum which scales as O(k1/3).

TI Heralded generation of programmable two-qubit entangled states on a

SO OPTICA QUANTUM
AB We present an experimental platform for linear-optical quantum information processing. Our setup utilizes multiphoton generation using a high-quality single-photon source, which is demultiplexed across multiple spatial channels, a custom-designed, programmable, low-loss photonic chip, and paired with high-efficiency single-photon detectors. We demonstrate the platform's capability heralded generation of arbitrary two-qubit dual-rail encoded states, including Bell states. Bell states are an invaluable resource for boosting the fusion gates within a photonic quantum computer [Phys. Rev. Lett. 115, 020502 (2015) ], The programmable chip was fully characterized through a calibration process that allowed us to create a numerical model that accounts for fabrication imperfections and measurement errors. As a result, using on-chip quantum state tomography (QST), we achieved high-fidelity quantum state preparation, with a fidelity of 98.5% specifically for the Bell state postselected in the dual-rail basis.

TI Effective prime factorization via quantum annealing by modular
   locally-structured embedding
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB This paper investigates novel techniques to solve prime factorization by quantum annealing (QA). First, we present a very-compact modular encoding of a multiplier circuit into the architecture of current D-Wave QA devices. The key contribution is a compact encoding of a controlled full-adder into an 8-qubit module in the Pegasus topology, which we synthesized using Optimization Modulo Theories. This allows us to encode up to a 21 x 12-bit multiplier (and a 22 x 8-bit one) into the Pegasus 5760-qubit topology of current annealers. To the best of our knowledge, these are the largest factorization problems ever encoded into a quantum annealer. Second, we investigated the problem of actually solving encoded PF problems by running an extensive experimental evaluation on a D-Wave Advantage 4.1 quantum annealer. In the experiments we introduced different approaches to initialize the multiplier qubits and adopted several performance enhancement techniques. Overall, 8,219,999 = 32,749 x 251 was the highest prime product we were able to factorize within the limits of our QPU resources. To the best of our knowledge, this is the largest number which was ever factorized by means of a quantum annealer; also, this is the largest number which was ever factorized by means of any quantum device without relying on external search or preprocessing procedures run on classical computers.

TI Efficient quantum algorithm for dissipative nonlinear differential
   equations
SO PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF
   AMERICA
AB Nonlinear differential equations model diverse phenomena but are notoriously difficult to solve. While there has been extensive previous work on efficient quantum algorithms for linear differential equations, the linearity of quantum mechanics has limited analogous progress for the nonlinear case. Despite this obstacle, we develop a quantum algorithm for dissipative quadratic n-dimensional ordinary differential equations. Assuming R < 1, where R is a parameter characterizing the ratio of the non-linearity and forcing to the linear dissipation, this algorithm has complexity T-2 q poly(log T, log n, log 1/epsilon)/epsilon, where T is the evolution time, E is the allowed error, and q measures decay of the solution. This is an exponential improvement over the best previous quantum algorithms, whose complexity is exponential in T. While exponential decay precludes efficiency, driven equations can avoid this issue despite the presence of dissipation. Our algorithm uses the method of Carleman linearization, for which we give a convergence theorem. This method maps a system of nonlinear differential equations to an infinite-dimensional system of linear differential equations, which we discretize, truncate, and solve using the forward Euler method and the quantum linear system algorithm. We also provide a lower bound on the worst-case complexity of quantum algorithms for general quadratic differential equations, showing that the problem is intractable for R >= root 2 Finally, we discuss potential applications, showing that the R < 1 condition can be satisfied in realistic epidemiological models and giving numerical evidence that the method may describe a model of fluid dynamics even for larger values of R.

TI Investigation of Nonlinear Raman Scattering in Optical Quantum
   Communication Systems
SO IET QUANTUM COMMUNICATION
AB In this paper, we introduce an improved spontaneous Raman scattering (SRS) model to accurately determine the quantum communication channel's quality when integrated into a Dense Wavelength Division Multiplexing (DWDM) network. To assess the degradational effect of counter-propagating SRS, we carried out laboratory experiments to analyse the impact of different variables, namely the input power, fibre length and channel arrangement. Based on the measurement results, we developed a new model for defining SRS within the C-band, which provides more precision in describing the impact of SRS compared to the previously used simplified V-shape model. A 96-channel DWDM use case, including one quantum and 90 classical channels, is modelled to identify the optimal channel wavelength allocation strategy. Using the revised model, we concluded that the optimal channel layout, where the channel numbering is based on the ITU-T standard, is with the quantum channel being the 88th (1533.4 nm), or the 96th (1530.2 nm) if we consider the classical capacity. In contrast, if the V-shape model is used for defining the optimal channel allocation, the quantum channel would be the 59th (1545 nm). The results show the importance of accurately modelling SRS, as determining the right channel placement is essential for the coexistence of quantum and classical channels.

TI Neural-network variational quantum algorithm for simulating many-body
   dynamics
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB We propose a neural-network variational quantum algorithm to simulate the time evolution of quantum many-body systems. Based on a modified restricted Boltzmann machine (RBM) wave function ansatz, the proposed algorithm can be efficiently implemented in near-term quantum computers with low measurement cost. Using a qubit recycling strategy, only one ancilla qubit is required to represent all the hidden spins in an RBM architecture. The variational algorithm is extended to open quantum systems by employing a stochastic Schrodinger equation approach. Numerical simulations of spin-lattice models demonstrate that our algorithm is capable of capturing the dynamics of closed and open quantum many-body systems with high accuracy without suffering from the vanishing gradient (or "barren plateau") issue for the considered system sizes.

We give several general results about hybrid codes, most notably that the quantum codes comprising a genuine hybrid code must be impure and that hybrid codes can always detect more errors than comparable quantum codes. We also introduce the weight enumerators for general hybrid codes, which we then use to derive linear programming bounds. Finally, inspired by the construction of some families of nonadditive codes, we construct several infinite families of genuine hybrid codes with minimum distance two and three.

TI Boolean semiring key-exchange with BLAKE3 security (BKEX-B3)
SO DISCOVER COMPUTING
AB Quantum computing has become a major threat to most classical cryptosystems, especially RSA and ECC cryptosystems. Thus, a new field, Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC), has come to light, aiming to create protocols that cannot be susceptible to quantum attacks. This work presents a new Boolean Semiring Key Exchange Protocol combined with BLAKE3 cryptographic hash function (BKEX-B3). The protocol leverages the flexibility of BLAKE3's eXtendable Output Function (XOF) and the nonlinearity of Boolean algebra to produce a flexible, quantum-resistant solution capable of dynamically adapting security levels to advancement in quantum algorithms. An examination of the protocol's performance reveals that it outperforms modern algorithms, especially in terms of memory efficiency and runtime, such as Kyber512, HQC-128, BIKE-L1, sntrup761, FrodoKEM-640-SHAKE, and NewHope. Its scalability and efficient resource management make it a highly appropriate solution that is adaptable and secure for the post-quantum era in environments with limited resources, such as the Internet of Things.

TI Quantum anonymous one vote veto protocol based on entanglement swapping
SO IET QUANTUM COMMUNICATION
AB As a special voting method, one-vote veto voting also has a wide range of applications. A veto means that when the voting council puts forward a proposal, it cannot pass unless all the voters agree to it. If there is a no vote, the proposal will be rejected, but no one will know how anyone else votes. In most existing quantum anonymous one-vote veto voting protocols, an absolutely honest third party is generally required to assist the voting. However, it is difficult to find a fully trusted third party in reality. In addition, the existing quantum anonymous one-vote veto protocol does not consider the attack from the insider voters. Therefore, based on the characteristics of entanglement swapping between the Cat state and Bell state, the authors propose a new quantum anonymous one-vote veto protocol, which can not only calculate the voting result quickly and effectively but also demonstrate higher security.

TI Interpreting Housing Prices with a MultidisciplinaryApproach Based on
   Nature-Inspired Algorithms and Quantum Computing
SO BUILDINGS
AB Current technology still does not allow the use of quantum computers for broader and individual uses; however, it is possible to simulate some of its potentialities through quantum computing. Quantum computing can be integrated with nature-inspired algorithms to innovatively analyze the dynamics of the real estate market or any other economic phenomenon. With this main aim, this study implements a multidisciplinary approach based on the integration of quantum computing and genetic algorithms to interpret housing prices. Starting from the principles of quantum programming, the work applies genetic algorithms for the marginal price determination of relevant real estate characteristics for a particular segment of Naples' real estate market. These marginal prices constitute the quantum program inputs to provide, as results, the purchase probabilities corresponding to each real estate characteristic considered. The other main outcomes of this study consist of a comparison of the optimal quantities for each real estate characteristic as determined by the quantum program and the average amounts of the same characteristics but relative to the real estate data sampled, as well as the weights of the same characteristics obtained with the implementation of genetic algorithms. With respect to the current state of the art, this study is among the first regarding the application of quantum computing to interpretation of selling prices in local real estate markets.

TI Modeling noisy quantum circuits using experimental characterization
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices offer unique platforms to test and evaluate the behavior of quantum computing. However, validating circuits on NISQ devices is difficult due to fluctuations in the underlying noise sources and other nonreproducible behaviors that generate computational errors. Here we present a test-driven approach that decomposes a noisy, application-specific circuit into a series of bootstrapped experiments on a NISQ device. By characterizing individual subcircuits, we generate a composite noise model for the original quantum circuit. We demonstrate this approach to model applications of Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger(GHZ)-state preparation and the Bernstein-Vazirani algorithm on a family of superconducting transmon devices. We measure the model accuracy using the total variation distance between predicted and experimental results, and we demonstrate that the composite model works well across multiple circuit instances. Our approach is shown to be computationally efficient and offers a trade-off in model complexity that can be tailored to the desired predictive accuracy.

TI Lightcone bounds for quantum circuit mapping via uncomplexity
SO NPJ QUANTUM INFORMATION
AB Efficiently mapping quantum circuits onto hardware is integral for the quantum compilation process, wherein a circuit is modified in accordance with a quantum processor's connectivity. Many techniques currently exist for solving this problem, wherein SWAP-gate overhead is usually prioritized as a cost metric. We reconstitute quantum circuit mapping using tools from quantum information theory, showing that a lower bound, which we dub the lightcone bound, emerges for a circuit executed on hardware. We also develop an initial placement algorithm based on graph similarity search, aiding us in optimally placing circuit qubits onto a device. 600 realistic benchmarks using the IBM Qiskit compiler and a brute-force method are then tested against the lightcone bound, with results unambiguously verifying the veracity of the bound, while permitting trustworthy estimations of minimal overhead in near-term realizations of quantum algorithms. This work constitutes the first use of quantum circuit uncomplexity to practically-relevant quantum computing.

TI Applying the Hubbard-Stratonovich Transformation to Solve Scheduling
   Problems Under Inequality Constraints With Quantum Annealing
SO FRONTIERS IN PHYSICS
AB Quantum annealing is a global optimization algorithm that uses the quantum tunneling effect to speed-up the search for an optimal solution. Its current hardware implementation relies on D-Wave's Quantum Processing Units, which are limited in terms of number of qubits and architecture while being restricted to solving quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO) problems. Consequently, previous applications of quantum annealing to real-life use cases have focused on problems that are either native QUBO or close to native QUBO. By contrast, in this paper we propose to tackle inequality constraints and non-quadratic terms. We demonstrate how to handle them with a realistic use case-a bus charging scheduling problem. First, we reformulate the original integer programming problem into a QUBO with the penalty method and directly solve it on a D-Wave machine. In a second approach, we dualize the problem by performing the Hubbard-Stratonovich transformation. The dual problem is solved indirectly by combining quantum annealing and adaptive classical gradient-descent optimizer. Whereas the penalty method is severely limited by the connectivity of the realistic device, we show experimentally that the indirect approach is able to solve problems of a larger size, offering thus a better scaling. Hence, the implementation of the Hubbard-Stratonovich transformation carried out in this paper on a scheduling use case suggests that this approach could be investigated further and applied to a variety of real-life integer programming problems under multiple constraints to lower the cost of mapping to QUBO, a key step towards the near-term practical application of quantum computing.

TI Initial Design of a W-Band Superconducting Kinetic Inductance Qubit
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON APPLIED SUPERCONDUCTIVITY
AB Superconducting qubits are widely used in quantum computing research and industry. We describe a superconducting kinetic inductance qubit (and introduce the term Kineticon to describe it) operating at W-band frequencies with a nonlinear nanowire section that provides the anharmonicity required for two distinct quantum energy states. Operating the qubits at higher frequencies may relax the dilution refrigerator temperature requirements for these devices and paves the path for multiplexing a large number of qubits. Millimeter-wave operation requires superconductors with relatively high T-c, which implies high gap frequency, 2 Delta/h, beyond which photons break Cooper pairs. For example, NbTiN with T-c = 15 K has a gap frequency near 1.4 THz, which is much higher than that of aluminum (90 GHz), allowing for operation throughout the millimeter-wave band. Here we describe a design and simulation of a W-band Kineticon qubit embedded in a 3-D cavity. We perform classical electromagnetic calculations of the resulting field distributions.

TI Quantum simulations of a qubit of space
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW D
AB In loop quantum gravity approach to Planck scale physics, quantum geometry is represented by superposition of the so-called spin network states. In the recent literature, a class of spin networks promising from the perspective of quantum simulations of quantum gravitational systems has been studied. In this case, the spin network states are represented by graphs with four-valent nodes, and two dimensional intertwiner Hilbert spaces (qubits of space) attached to them. In this article, construction of quantum circuits for a general intertwiner qubit is presented. The obtained circuits are simulated on 5-qubit (Yorktown) and 15-qubit (Melbourne) IBM superconducting quantum computers, giving satisfactory fidelities. The circuits provide building blocks for quantum simulations of complex spin networks in the future. Furthermore, a class of maximally entangled states of spin networks is introduced. As an example of application, attempts to determine transition amplitudes for a monopole and a dipole spin network with the use of superconducting quantum processor are made.

TI Trotterless Simulation of Open Quantum Systems for NISQ Quantum Devices
SO ADVANCED QUANTUM TECHNOLOGIES
AB The simulation of quantum systems is one of the flagship applications of near-term NISQ (noisy intermediate-scale quantum) computing devices. Efficiently simulating the rich, non-unitary dynamics of open quantum systems remains challenging on NISQ hardware. Current simulation methods for open quantum systems employ time-stepped Trotter product formulas ("Trotterization") which can scale poorly with respect to the simulation time and system dimension. Here, a new simulation method is proposed based on the derivation of a time-perturbative Kraus operator series representation of the system. A class of open quantum systems is identified for which this method produces circuits of time-independent depth, which may serve as a desirable alternative to Trotterization, especially on NISQ devices.
   Open quantum systems exhibit complex dynamics that can be simulated on quantum computers to provide physical insights into their behavior. This work proposes a new method for simulating these systems that reduces the effect of noise and errors on modern quantum hardware. Unlike existing methods, it distributes the simulation's computational workload over many short quantum circuits. image

TI Sequential and Programmable Squeezing Gates for Optical Non-Gaussian
   Input States
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB Quantum computing has been pursued with various hardware platforms and an optical system is one of the most reasonable choices for large-scale computation. In the optical continuous-variable computation scheme, the incorporation of Gaussian gates and a highly nonclassical non-Gaussian state enables universal quantum computation. Although basic technologies for Gaussian gates and non-Gaussian state generation have long been developed, these building blocks have not yet been integrated in a scalable fashion. Here, we integrate them to develop a scalable and programmable optical quantum computing platform that can sequentially perform an essential Gaussian gate, the squeezing gate, on a non-Gaussian input state. The key enablers are a loop-based optical circuit with dynamical and programmable controllability and its time synchronization with the probabilistic non-Gaussian state generation. We verify the deterministic, programmable, and repeatable quantum gates on a typical non-Gaussian state by implementing up to three-step gates. The gates implemented are of such high quality that strong evidence of the nonclassicalities of the states, the negativities of the Wigner functions, are preserved even after multistep gates. This platform is compatible with other non-Gaussian states and can in principle realize large-scale universal quantum computing by incorporating other existing processing technologies.

TI Quantum Circuit Compilation for Trapped-Ion Processors With the
   Drive-Through Architecture
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON QUANTUM ENGINEERING
AB Trapped-ion technologies stand out as leading contenders in the pursuit of quantum computing, due to their capacity for highly entangled qubits. Among many proposed trapped-ion architectures, the "drive-through" architecture has drawn increasing attention, notably for its remarkable ability to minimize heat generation, which is crucial for low-temperature operation and thermal noise reduction, thus reliable quantum computation. We present the first compilation system tailored for the drive-through architecture to achieve high-fidelity computation for intended quantum programs. Our approach accommodates the unique features of the new architecture that utilize transport gates to facilitate direct entanglement between static qubits and communication qubits. We optimize the qubit placement that changes over time for each trap, considering the cost of qubit swapping. Our method strategically balances the gate and swap distances, significantly improving the overall fidelity across various benchmarks.

TI Enhancing Security in Low-powerWide-area (LPWA) IoT Environments:The
   Role of HSM, Tamper-proof Technology,and Quantum Cryptography
SO JOURNAL OF WEB ENGINEERING
AB Low-power wide-area (LPWA) networks are integral to expanding Internetof Things (IoT) applications, offering extensive coverage with low powerconsumption. However, these networks face significant security challengesdue to their widespread deployment and inherent constraints. In order toprovide secure services in an LPWA IoT environment, important informa-tion stored in IoT devices (encryption keys, device unique numbers, etc.)must be safely protected from external hacking or theft by physical access,and it is necessary to develop tamper-proof technology to enhance physicalsecurity. Meanwhile, with so many ruggedized IoT devices processing andtransmitting sensitive information, security systems are essential to protectthe integrity and privacy of IoT data. This paper explores the critical role ofhardware security modules (HSMs), tamper-proof technology, and quantum cryptography in enhancing the physical, network, and data security of LPWAIoT environments. We propose operational strategies for HSMs, tamper-prooftechnology in ruggedized LPWA IoT settings, and a quantum key distribution(QKD)-based IPsec solution for robust network and data security.

TI Continuous-time dynamics and error scaling of noisy highly entangling
   quantum circuits
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB We investigate the continuous-time dynamics of highly entangling intermediate-scale quantum circuits in the presence of dissipation and decoherence. By compressing the Hilbert space to a time-dependent "corner" subspace that supports faithful representations of the density matrix, we simulate a noisy quantum Fourier transform processor with up to 21 qubits. Our method is efficient to compute with a controllable accuracy the time evolution of intermediate-scale open quantum systems with moderate entropy, while taking into account microscopic dissipative processes rather than relying on digital error models. The circuit size reached in our simulations allows to extract the scaling behavior of error propagation with the dissipation rates and the number of qubits. Moreover, we show that depending on the dissipative mechanisms at play, the choice of the input state has a strong impact on the performance of the quantum algorithm.

TI Weak entanglement improves quantum communication using only product
   measurements
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW APPLIED
AB We show that weakly entangled states can improve communication over a qubit channel using only separate, interference -free, measurements of individual photons. We introduce a communication task corresponding to the cryptographic primitive known as secret sharing and show that all steerable twoqubit isotropic states provide a quantum advantage in the success rate using only product measurements. Furthermore, we show that such measurements can even reveal communication advantages from noisy partially entangled states that admit no quantum steering. We then go further and consider a stochastic variant of secret sharing based on more -sophisticated, yet standard, partial Bell -state analyzers, and show that this reveals advantages also for a range of unsteerable isotropic states. By preparing polarization qubits in unsteerable states, we experimentally demonstrate increased success rates of both secret -sharing tasks beyond the best entanglement -unassisted qubit protocol. Our results reveal the capability of simple and scalable measurements in entanglement -assisted quantum communication to overcome large amounts of noise.

TI Factorization dynamics between quantum Fisher information and quantum
   coherence
SO SCIENCE ADVANCES
AB Quantum Fisher information (QFI) quantifies the sensitivity of a quantum state to a parameter change and plays a key role in quantum metrology. Meanwhile, quantum coherence is a crucial resource for quantum information processing. However, despite extensive studies on various aspects of quantum metrology, the interplay between the dynamics of the QFI and quantum coherence remains unexplored. Here, we explore the factorization relationship between the QFI and quantum coherence, both theoretically and experimentally. We prepare pure states in qubit and qutrit systems and apply unitary evolution to investigate this relationship. Our results confirm the factorization law, offering strong evidence for this relationship. Furthermore, we establish a lower bound on the variance of the estimated parameter that does not require the final state information. This approach reveals a deep connection between the QFI and quantum coherence, providing insights into quantum parameter estimation. These findings have potential applications in quantum sensing and quantum metrology.

TI Revealing quantum contextuality using a single measurement device
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB In this paper we analyze the notion of measurement noncontextuality (MNC) and identify contextual scenarios which involve sequential measurements of only a single measurement device. We show that any noncontextual ontological model fails to explain the statistics of outcomes of a single carefully constructed positive-operator-valued measure (POVM) executed sequentially on a quantum system. The context of measurement arises from the different configurations in which the device can be used. We develop an inequality from the noncontextual (NC) ontic model, and construct a quantum situation involving measurements from the Klyachko-Can-Binicioglu-Shumovsky (KCBS) inequality. We show that the resultant statistics arising from this device violate our NC inequality. This device can be generalized by incorporating measurements from arbitrary n-cycle contextuality inequalities of which n = 5 corresponds to the KCBS inequality. We show that the NC and quantum bounds for various scenarios can be derived more easily using only the functional relationships between the outcomes for larger values n. This makes it one of the simpler contextual inequalities to analyze.

TI Moments based entanglement criteria and measures
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICS A-MATHEMATICAL AND THEORETICAL
AB Quantum entanglement plays a key role in quantum computation and quantum information processing. It is of great significance to find efficient and experimentally friend separability criteria to detect entanglement. In this paper, we firstly propose two easily used entanglement criteria based on matrix moments. The first entanglement criterion only uses the first two realignment moments of a density matrix. The second entanglement criterion is based on the moments related to the partially transposed matrix. By detailed examples we illustrate the effectiveness of these criteria in detecting entanglement. Moreover, we provide an experimentally measurable lower bound of concurrence based on these moments. Finally, we present both bipartite and genuine tripartite entanglement measures based on the moments of the reduced states. By detailed examples, we show that our entanglement measures characterize the quantum entanglement in a more fine ways than the existing measures.

TI Quantum Implementation of Numerical Methods for Convection-Diffusion

SO COMMUNICATIONS IN COMPUTATIONAL PHYSICS
AB We present quantum numerical methods for the typical initial boundary value problems (IBVPs) of convection-diffusion equations in fluid dynamics. The IBVP is discretized into a series of linear systems via finite difference methods and explicit time marching schemes. To solve these discrete systems in quantum computers, we design a series of quantum circuits, including four stages of encoding, amplification, adding source terms, and incorporating boundary conditions. In the encoding stage, the initial condition is encoded in the amplitudes of quantum registers as a state vector to take advantage of quantum algorithms in space complexity. In the following three stages, the discrete differential operators in classical computing are converted into uni-tary evolutions to satisfy the postulate in quantum systems. The related arithmetic calculations in quantum amplitudes are also realized to sum up the increments from these stages. The proposed quantum algorithm is implemented within the open-source quantum computing framework Qiskit [2]. By simulating one-dimensional transient problems, including the Helmholtz equation, the Burgers' equation, and Navier-Stokes equations, we demonstrate the capability of quantum computers in fluid dynamics.

The trotterization steps are further optimized using the Cartan decomposition of two-qubit unitary gates U is an element of SUo4 thorn in the minimum number of controlled-NOT (CNOT) gates making the algorithm more resilient to the hardware noise. A more efficient hybrid quantum-classical algorithm is also explored to solve the problem on noisy intermediate-scale quantum devices.

TI Battleship, tomography and quantum annealing
SO EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF APPLIED MATHEMATICS
AB The classic game of Battleship involves two players taking turns attempting to guess the positions of a fleet of vertically or horizontally positioned enemy ships hidden on a 10x10 grid. One variant of this game, also referred to as Battleship Solitaire, Bimaru or Yubotu, considers the game with the inclusion of X-ray data, represented by knowledge of how many spots are occupied in each row and column in the enemy board. This paper considers the Battleship puzzle problem: the problem of reconstructing an enemy fleet from its X-ray data. We generate non-unique solutions to Battleship puzzles via certain reflection transformations akin to Ryser interchanges. Furthermore, we demonstrate that solutions of Battleship puzzles may be reliably obtained by searching for solutions of the associated classical binary discrete tomography problem which minimise the discrete Laplacian. We reformulate this optimisation problem as a quadratic unconstrained binary optimisation problem and approximate solutions via a simulated annealer, emphasising the future practical applicability of quantum annealers to solving discrete tomography problems with predefined structure.

TI Assisted Postselective Quantum Transformations and an Improved Photon
   Number Splitting Attack Strategy
SO MATHEMATICS
AB Postselective transformations of quantum states is a broader class of operations than deterministic quantum channels. Here, we describe the possibility of increasing the success probability of postselective operations by using additional information, which has a form of pure quantum states and should not be changed in case of success. We describe the conditions under which assistance becomes useful, and provide application of our method which improves the efficiency of photon number splitting attack for a variant of SARG04 quantum key distribution protocol. In our attack scenario, one extra photon, which is unchanged, plays the role of assistance.

TI Towards Quantum Computing Phase Diagrams of Gauge Theories with Thermal
   Pure Quantum States
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB The phase diagram of strong interactions in nature at finite temperature and chemical potential remains largely theoretically unexplored due to inadequacy of Monte-Carlo-based computational techniques in overcoming a sign problem. Quantum computing offers a sign-problem-free approach, but evaluating thermal expectation values is generally resource intensive on quantum computers. To facilitate thermodynamic studies of gauge theories, we propose a generalization of the thermal-pure-quantum-state formulation of statistical mechanics applied to constrained gauge-theory dynamics, and numerically demonstrate that the phase diagram of a simple low-dimensional gauge theory is robustly determined using this approach, including mapping a chiral phase transition in the model at finite temperature and chemical potential. Quantum algorithms, resource requirements, and algorithmic and hardware error analysis are further discussed to motivate future implementations. Thermal pure quantum states, therefore, may present a suitable candidate for efficient thermal simulations of gauge theories in the era of quantum computing.

TI Quantifying non-stabilizerness via information scrambling
SO SCIPOST PHYSICS
AB The advent of quantum technologies brought forward much attention to the theoretical characterization of the computational resources they provide. A method to quantify quantum resources is to use a class of functions called magic monotones and stabilizer entropies, which are, however, notoriously hard and impractical to evaluate for large system sizes. In recent studies, a fundamental connection between information scrambling, the magic monotone mana and 2-Renyi stabilizer entropy was established. This connection simplified magic monotone calculation, but this class of methods still suffers from exponential scaling with respect to the number of qubits. In this work, we establish a way to sample an out -of -time -order correlator that approximates magic monotones and 2-Renyi stabilizer entropy. We numerically show the relation of these sampled correlators to different non-stabilizerness measures for both qubit and qutrit systems and provide an analytical relation to 2-Renyi stabilizer entropy. Furthermore, we put forward and simulate a protocol to measure the monotonic behaviour of magic for the time evolution of local Hamiltonians.

TI A Quantum Key Distribution System for Mobile Platforms With Highly
   Indistinguishable States
SO IET QUANTUM COMMUNICATION
AB Quantum key distribution (QKD) allows two users to exchange a provably secure key for cryptographic applications. In prepare-and-measure QKD protocols, the states must be indistinguishable to prevent information leakage to an eavesdropper performing a side-channel attack. Here, we measure the indistinguishability of quantum states in a prepare-and-measure three-state BB84 polarisation-based decoy state protocol using resonant-cavity light-emitting diodes (RC-LEDs) as the source in the transmitter. We make the spatial, spectral and temporal DOF of the generated quantum states nearly indistinguishable using a spatial filter single-mode fibre, a narrow-band spectral filter and adjustable timing of the electrical pulses driving the RC-LEDs, respectively. The sources have fully indistinguishable transverse spatial modes. The measured fractional mutual information between an assumed eavesdropper and the legitimate receiver is due to the spectral distinguishability and for the temporal distinguishability. The source is integrated into a full QKD system operating in a laboratory environment, where we achieve a secure key rate of 41.5 kbits/s with an average quantum bit error rate of 2.9%. The low system size, weight and power make it suitable for mobile platforms such as uncrewed aerial vehicles (drones) or automobiles.

TI Entropy of a quantum channel
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB The von Neumann entropy of a quantum state is a central concept in physics and information theory, having a number of compelling physical interpretations. There is a certain perspective that the most fundamental notion in quantum mechanics is that of a quantum channel, as quantum states, unitary evolutions, measurements, and discarding of quantum systems can each be regarded as certain kinds of quantum channels. Thus, an important goal is to define a consistent and meaningful notion of the entropy of a quantum channel. Motivated by the fact that the entropy of a state rho can be formulated as the difference of the number of physical qubits and the "relative entropy distance" between rho and the maximally mixed state, here we define the entropy of a channel N as the difference of the number of physical qubits of the channel output with the "relative entropy distance" between N and the completely depolarizing channel. We prove that this definition satisfies all of the axioms, recently put forward by Gour [IEEE Trans. Inf. Theory 65, 5880 (2019)], required for a channel entropy function. The task of quantum channel merging, in which the goal is for the receiver to merge his share of the channel with the environment's share, gives a compelling operational interpretation of the entropy of a channel. The entropy of a channel can be negative for certain channels, but this negativity has an operational interpretation in terms of the channel merging protocol. We define Renyi and min-entropies of a channel and prove that they satisfy the axioms required for a channel entropy function. Among other results, we also prove that a smoothed version of the min-entropy of a channel satisfies the asymptotic equipartition property.

TI Protocol for generation of high-dimensional entanglement from an array
   of non-interacting photon emitters
SO NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB Encoding high-dimensional quantum information into single photons can provide a variety of benefits for quantum technologies, such as improved noise resilience. However, the efficient generation of on-demand, high-dimensional entanglement was thought to be out of reach for current and near-future photonic quantum technologies. We present a protocol for the near-deterministic generation of N-photon, d-dimensional photonic Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) states using an array of d non-interacting single-photon emitters. We analyse the impact on performance of common sources of error for quantum emitters, such as photon spectral distinguishability and temporal mismatch, and find they are readily correctable with time-resolved detection to yield high fidelity GHZ states of multiple qudits. When applied to a quantum key distribution scenario, our protocol exhibits improved loss tolerance and key rates when increasing the dimensionality beyond binary encodings.

TI Quantum Models of Consciousness from a Quantum Information Science
   Perspective
SO ENTROPY
AB This perspective explores various quantum models of consciousness from the viewpoint of quantum information science, offering potential ideas and insights. The models under consideration can be categorized into three distinct groups based on the level at which quantum mechanics might operate within the brain: those suggesting that consciousness arises from electron delocalization within microtubules inside neurons, those proposing it emerges from the electromagnetic field surrounding the entire neural network, and those positing it originates from the interactions between individual neurons governed by neurotransmitter molecules. Our focus is particularly on the Posner model of cognition, for which we provide preliminary calculations on the preservation of entanglement of phosphate molecules within the geometric structure of Posner clusters. These findings provide valuable insights into how quantum information theory can enhance our understanding of brain functions.

TI Multimode Ion-Photon Entanglement over 101 Kilometers
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB A three-qubit quantum network node based on trapped atomic ions is presented. The ability to establish entanglement between each individual qubit in the node and a separate photon that has traveled over a 101km-long optical fiber is demonstrated. By sending those photons through the fiber in close succession, a remote entanglement rate is achieved that is greater than when using only a single qubit in the node. Once extended to more qubits, this multimode approach can be a useful technique to boost entanglementdistribution rates in future long-distance quantum networks of light and matter.

   structural motif of the surface radicals in
   α-Al2O3
SO SCIENCE ADVANCES
AB Quantum information technology puts stringent demands on the quality of materials and interfaces in the pursuit of increased device coherence. Yet, little is known about the chemical structure and origins of paramagnetic impurities that produce flux/charge noise that causes decoherence of fragile quantum states and impedes the progress toward large-scale quantum computing. Here, we perform high magnetic field electron paramagnetic resonance (HFEPR) and hyperfine multispin spectroscopy on alpha-Al2O3, a common substrate for quantum devices. In its amorphous form, alpha-Al2O3 is also unavoidably present in aluminum-based superconducting circuits and qubits. The detected paramagnetic centers are immanent to the surface and have a well-defined but highly complex structure that extends over multiple hydrogen, aluminum, and oxygen atoms. Modeling reveals that the radicals likely originate from well-known reactive oxygen chemistry common to many metal oxides. We discuss how EPR spectroscopy might benefit the search for surface passivation and decoherence mitigation strategies.

TI Quantum-classical synergy: enhancing quantum generative adversarial
   networks for lmage synthesis
SO EPJ QUANTUM TECHNOLOGY
AB Quantum Generative Adversarial Networks (QGANs), as a rising paradigm in Quantum Machine Learning, have shown promising potential in image generation and processing. However, their output quality remains suboptimal, and existing research is largely limited to small-scale, proof-of-concept studies. In this work, we propose a hybrid quantum-classical GAN architecture, where the generator integrates parameterized quantum circuits (PQCs) and classical neural networks. This integration significantly enhances the visual quality of generated images. Our model leverages the complementary strengths of quantum and classical components and outperforms existing methods (Tsang et al. in IEEE Trans. Quantum Eng. 4:1-19, 2023; Gulrajani et al. in Proceedings of the 31st international conference on neural information processing systems. NIPS'17, Red Hook, pp. 5769-5779, 2017), particularly in terms of image fidelity. Experiments conducted on the MNIST family of datasets show that our hybrid approach achieves a 20.26% average reduction in Fr & eacute;chet Inception Distance. Furthermore, it improves the Structural Similarity Index Measure, Cosine Similarity, and Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio by 26.04%, 2.22%, and 7.62%, respectively. These results highlight the effectiveness of combining quantum computing with machine learning, and underscore the potential of hybrid quantum-classical models in advancing generative tasks.

TI Non-isometric quantum error correction in gravity
SO JOURNAL OF HIGH ENERGY PHYSICS
AB We construct and study an ensemble of non-isometric error correcting codes in a toy model of an evaporating black hole in two-dimensional dilaton gravity. In the preferred bases of Euclidean path integral states in the bulk and Hamiltonian eigenstates in the boundary, the encoding map is proportional to a linear transformation with independent complex Gaussian random entries of zero mean and unit variance. Using measure concentration, we show that the typical such code is very likely to preserve pairwise inner products in a set S of states that can be subexponentially large in the microcanonical Hilbert space dimension of the black hole. The size of this set also serves as an upper limit on the bulk effective field theory Hilbert space dimension. Similar techniques are used to demonstrate the existence of state-specific reconstructions of S-preserving code space unitary operators. State-specific reconstructions on subspaces exist when they are expected to by entanglement wedge reconstruction. We comment on relations to complexity theory and the breakdown of bulk effective field theory.

TI Efficient Quantum Network Communication Using Optimized Entanglement
   Swapping Trees
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON QUANTUM ENGINEERING
AB Quantum network communication is challenging, as the no-cloning theorem in the quantum regime makes many classical techniques inapplicable; in particular, the direct transmission of qubit states over long distances is infeasible due to unrecoverable errors. For the long-distance communication of unknown quantum states, the only viable communication approach (assuming local operations and classical communications) is the teleportation of quantum states, which requires a prior distribution of the entangled pairs (EPs) of qubits. The establishment of EPs across remote nodes can incur significant latency due to the low probability of success of the underlying physical processes. The focus of our work is to develop efficient techniques that minimize EP generation latency. Prior works have focused on selecting entanglement paths; in contrast, we select entanglement swapping trees-a more accurate representation of the entanglement generation structure. We develop a dynamic programming algorithm to select an optimal swapping tree for a single pair of nodes, under the given capacity and fidelity constraints. For the general setting, we develop an efficient iterative algorithm to compute a set of swapping trees. We present simulation results, which show that our solutions outperform the prior approaches by an order of magnitude and are viable for long-distance entanglement generation.

The course, which featured eight interactive lectures, was organized online between March and May 2021 and attended by about 250 students from all over Italy. In this paper, we describe the main tenets and activities of the course. Moreover, we report on the effectiveness of the course on students' knowledge of the basic concepts of quantum physics and students' views about epistemic aspects and applications of quantum technologies. Results show that the designed activities were effective in improving students' knowledge about fundamental aspects of quantum mechanics and familiarizing them with quantum technology applications.

TI Fundamental resolution limit of quantum imaging with undetected photons
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Quantum imaging with undetected photons relies on the principle of induced coherence without induced emission and uses two sources of photon pairs with a signal-and an idler photon. Each pair shares strong quantum correlations in both position and momentum, which allows us to image an object illuminated with idler photons by just measuring signal photons that never interact with the object. In this work, we theoretically investigate the transverse resolution of this nonlocal imaging scheme through a general formalism that treats propagating photons beyond the commonly used paraxial approximation. We hereby prove that the resolution of quantum imaging with undetected photons is fundamentally diffraction limited to the longer wavelength of the signal and idler pairs. Moreover, we conclude that this result is also valid for other nonlocal two-photon imaging schemes.

TI High fidelity two-qubit gates on fluxoniums using a tunable coupler
SO NPJ QUANTUM INFORMATION
AB Superconducting fluxonium qubits provide a promising alternative to transmons on the path toward large-scale superconductor-based quantum computing due to their better coherence and larger anharmonicity. A major challenge for multi-qubit fluxonium devices is the experimental demonstration of a scalable crosstalk-free multi-qubit architecture with high-fidelity single-qubit and two-qubit gates, single-shot readout, and state initialization. Here, we present a two-qubit fluxonium-based quantum processor with a tunable coupler element. We experimentally demonstrate fSim-type and controlled-Z-gates with 99.55 and 99.23% fidelities, respectively. The residual ZZ interaction is suppressed down to the few kHz levels. Using a galvanically coupled flux control line, we implement high-fidelity single-qubit gates and ground state initialization with a single arbitrary waveform generator channel per qubit.

TI Kerr-enhanced optomechanical entanglement generation via reservoir
   design
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Quantum entanglement is a crucial resource in quantum technologies, enabling advancements in quantum computing, quantum communication, and quantum precision measurement. Here, we propose a method to enhance optomechanical entanglement by introducing an optical Kerr nonlinear medium and a squeezed vacuum reservoir of the optomechanical cavity. By performing the displacement and squeezing transformations, the system can be reduced to a standard linearized optomechanical system with normalized driving detuning and linearized-coupling strength, in which the optical and mechanical modes are, respectively, coupled to an optical vacuum bath and a mechanical heat bath. We focus on the entanglement generation in the single stable regime of the system. By evaluating the steady-state logarithm negativity, we find that the optomechanical entanglement can be enhanced within a wide range of the Kerr constant. In addition, the Kerr nonlinearity can extend the stable region, enabling considerable entanglement generation in the blue-sideband parameter region. We also investigate the dependence of the entanglement generation on the average thermal phonon occupation of the mechanical bath and the optical driving amplitude. It is found that the presence of the Kerr nonlinearity allows the generation of optomechanical entanglement even when the thermal phonon occupation of the mechanical bath is as high as 3000. Our findings will provide valuable insights into enhancing fragile quantum resources in quantum systems.

TI Quantum algorithm for Feynman loop integrals
SO JOURNAL OF HIGH ENERGY PHYSICS
AB We present a novel benchmark application of a quantum algorithm to Feynman loop integrals. The two on-shell states of a Feynman propagator are identified with the two states of a qubit and a quantum algorithm is used to unfold the causal singular configurations of multiloop Feynman diagrams. To identify such configurations, we exploit Grover's algorithm for querying multiple solutions over unstructured datasets, which presents a quadratic speed-up over classical algorithms when the number of solutions is much smaller than the number of possible configurations. A suitable modification is introduced to deal with topologies in which the number of causal states to be identified is nearly half of the total number of states. The output of the quantum algorithm in IBM Quantum and QUTE Testbed simulators is used to bootstrap the causal representation in the loop-tree duality of representative multiloop topologies. The algorithm may also find application and interest in graph theory to solve problems involving directed acyclic graphs.

TI Entanglement teleportation along a regenerating hamster-wheel graph
   state
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB We present an efficient and reusable approach to quantum teleportation that allows cyclic teleportation of a two-qubit graph state around a quantum hamster wheel-a ring of qubits entangled as a one-dimensional line prepared on the 20-qubit Quantinuum H1-1 ion-trap quantum processor. The qubits on the ring are periodically measured and reused to achieve a teleportation depth that exceeds the total number of available qubits in the quantum processor. Using the outcomes measured during teleportation, we calculate and apply byproduct operators through dynamic circuits to correct local transformations induced on the teleported state. We evaluate the quality of teleportation by tracing the preserved entanglement and fidelity of the teleported two-qubit graph state from its density matrix. In the real-machine experiments, we demonstrate that 58% of the teleported state's entanglement is sustained with a measured two-qubit negativity of \documentclass[12pt]{minimal} \usepackage{amsmath} \usepackage{wasysym} \usepackage{amsfonts} \usepackage{amssymb} \usepackage{amsbsy} \usepackage{mathrsfs} \usepackage{upgreek} \setlength{\oddsidemargin}{-69pt} \begin{document}$$0.291\pm 0.018$$\end{document} after three complete revolutions around the hamster wheel, or equivalently, after hopping across 56 qubits. On the machine-specific noisy emulator, we found that the teleported state after 100 hops still sustained 45% of its entanglement. By performing teleportation along a regenerating graph state, our work provides a benchmarking strategy on the entanglement-preserving capability of physical quantum computers beyond their own qubit count through cluster state cycling quality, as well as a step forward in demonstrating the feasibility of a core ingredient in measurement-based quantum computation.

TI Coherence enhancement via a diamond-graphene hybrid for nanoscale
   quantum sensing
SO NATIONAL SCIENCE REVIEW
AB Quantum coherence serves as a crucial quantum resource for achieving high-sensitivity quantum sensing. Because of its long coherence time at room temperature, the nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center has emerged as a quantum sensor in various fields in recent years. While nanoscale quantum sensing at room temperature has been demonstrated for NV centers, noise on the diamond surface severely limits its further development at a higher sensitivity. Here, we utilize the hybridization between graphene and diamond surfaces to directly deplete surface unpaired electron spins, thereby achieving roughly two-fold enhancement in coherence. Through the combination of electron spin resonance spectra and first-principle calculations, we explain that this phenomenon arises from a significant reduction in electron spin density on the diamond surface due to interface electron orbital hybridization. Our research presents a new approach for solid-state quantum sensors to reach the desired sensitivity level and offers a new pathway for future studies on material interfaces.
   This study establishes a significant enhancement in the spin coherence properties of shallow nitrogen-vacancy centers through graphene-diamond heterostructure integration, proposing a novel methodology to improve sensitivity in solid-state quantum sensing platforms.

TI Two-Qubit Steerability, Nonlocality, and Average Steered Coherence under
   Classical Dephasing Channels
SO ANNALEN DER PHYSIK
AB When two qubits are prepared in a mixture of two Bell states and exposed to local transmission channels, the dynamics of steerability, Bell nonlocality, and average steered coherence are investigated. Disorders are assumed to influence the channels, resulting in either Markovian Ornstein-Uhlenbeck noise or non-Markovian static noise in two models: a single noisy channel or two local noisy channels. Their findings show that the type and number of classical channels, noise, and initial state must be in an optimal setting in order to preserve quantum correlations.

TI Phase-covariant mixtures of non-unital qubit maps
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICS A-MATHEMATICAL AND THEORETICAL
AB We analyze convex combinations of non-unital qubit maps that are phase-covariant. In particular, we consider the behavior of maps that combine amplitude damping, inverse amplitude damping, and pure dephasing. We show that mixing non-unital channels can result in restoring the unitality, whereas mixing commutative maps can lead to non-commutativity. For the convex combinations of Markovian semigroups, we prove that classical uncertainties cannot break quantum Markovianity. Moreover, contrary to the Pauli channel case, the semigroup can be recovered only by mixing two other semigroups.

TI Molecular qubits based on photogenerated spin-correlated radical pairs
   for quantum sensing
SO CHEMICAL PHYSICS REVIEWS
AB Photogenerated spin-correlated radical pairs (SCRPs) in electron donor-bridge-acceptor (D-B-A) molecules can act as molecular qubits and inherently spin qubit pairs. SCRPs can take singlet and triplet spin states, comprising the quantum superposition state. Their synthetic accessibility and well-defined structures, together with their ability to be prepared in an initially pure, entangled spin state and optical addressability, make them one of the promising avenues for advancing quantum information science. Coherence between two spin states and spin selective electron transfer reactions form the foundation of using SCRPs as qubits for sensing. We can exploit the unique sensitivity of the spin dynamics of SCRPs to external magnetic fields for sensing applications including resolution-enhanced imaging, magnetometers, and magnetic switch. Molecular quantum sensors, if realized, can provide new technological developments beyond what is possible with classical counterparts. While the community of spin chemistry has actively investigated magnetic field effects on chemical reactions via SCRPs for several decades, we have not yet fully exploited the synthetic tunability of molecular systems to our advantage. This review offers an introduction to the photogenerated SCRPs-based molecular qubits for quantum sensing, aiming to lay the foundation for researchers new to the field and provide a basic reference for researchers active in the field. We focus on the basic principles necessary to construct molecular qubits based on SCRPs and the examples in quantum sensing explored to date from the perspective of the experimentalist.

A brief history of coupled cluster (CC) methods is provided, followed by a broad discussion of the formulation of CC theory. This includes touching on the merits and difficulties of the method and several variants, UCC among them, in the classical context, to motivate their applications on quantum computers. In the core of the text, the UCC ansatz and its implementation on a quantum computer are discussed at length, in addition to a discussion on several derived and related ansatze specific to quantum computing. The review concludes with a unified perspective on the discussed ansatze, attempting to bring them under a common framework, as well as with a reflection upon open problems within the field.

TI Doubly stochastic matrices and the quantum channels
SO JOURNAL OF APPLIED MATHEMATICS STATISTICS AND INFORMATICS
AB The main object of this paper is to study doubly stochastic matrices with majorization and the Birkhoff theorem. The Perron-Frobenius theorem on eigenvalues is generalized for doubly stochastic matrices. The region of all possible eigenvalues of n-by-n doubly stochastic matrix is the union of regular (n - 1) polygons into the complex plane. This statement is ensured by a famous conjecture known as the Perfect-Mirsky conjecture which is true for n = 1, 2, 3, 4 and untrue for n = 5. We show the extremal eigenvalues of the Perfect-Mirsky regions graphically for n = 1, 2, 3, 4 and identify corresponding doubly stochastic matrices. Bearing in mind the counterexample of Rivard-Mashreghi given in 2007, we introduce a more general counterexample to the conjecture for n = 5. Later, we discuss different types of positive maps relevant to Quantum Channels (QCs) and finally introduce a theorem to determine whether a QCs gives rise to a doubly stochastic matrix or not. This evidence is straightforward and uses the basic tools of matrix theory and functional analysis.

TI Analyzing performance of commercial quantum annealing solvers for the
   capacitated vehicle routing problem
SO AIP ADVANCES
AB Quantum Annealing (QA) is a heuristic search algorithm that can run on adiabatic quantum computation processors to solve combinatorial optimization problems. Although theoretical studies and simulations on classical hardware have shown encouraging results, these analyses often assume that the computation occurs in adiabatically closed systems without environmental interference. This is not a realistic assumption for real systems; therefore, without extensive empirical measurements on real quantum platforms, theory-based predictions, simulations on classical hardware, or limited tests do not accurately assess the current commercial capabilities. This study has assessed the quality of the solution provided by a commercial quantum annealing platform compared to known solutions for the capacitated vehicle routing problem. This study has conducted an extensive analysis on more than 30 hours of access to QA commercial platforms to investigate how the size of the problem and its complexity impact the accuracy of the solution and the time used to find a solution. Our results have found that the absolute error is between 0.12 and 0.55, and the time of the quantum processor unit is between 30 and 46 mu s. Our results show that as the constraint density increases, the quality of the solution degrades. Therefore, more than the size of the problem, the complexity of the model plays a critical role, and practical applications should select formulations that minimize the constraint density.

TI Experimental quantum simulation of non-Hermitian dynamical topological
   states using stochastic Schrodinger equation
SO NPJ QUANTUM INFORMATION
AB Noise is ubiquitous in real quantum systems, leading to non-Hermitian quantum dynamics, and may affect the fundamental states of matter. Here we report in an experiment a quantum simulation of the two-dimensional non-Hermitian quantum anomalous Hall (QAH) model using the nuclear magnetic resonance processor. Unlike the usual experiments using auxiliary qubits, we develop a stochastic average approach based on the stochastic Schrodinger equation to realize the non-Hermitian dissipative quantum dynamics, which has advantages in saving the quantum simulation sources and simplifying the implementation of quantum gates. We demonstrate the stability of dynamical topology against weak noise and observe two types of dynamical topological transitions driven by strong noise. Moreover, a region where the emergent topology is always robust regardless of the noise strength is observed. Our work shows a feasible quantum simulation approach for dissipative quantum dynamics with stochastic Schrodinger equation and opens a route to investigate non-Hermitian dynamical topological physics.

TI Parameter optimization for the unimon qubit
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Inductively shunted superconducting qubits, such as the unimon qubit, combine high anharmonicity with protection from low-frequency charge noise, positioning them as promising candidates for the implementation of fault-tolerant superconducting quantum computers. In this work, we develop accurate closed-form approximations for the frequency and anharmonicity of the unimon qubit that are also applicable to any single-mode superconducting qubits with a single-well potential profile, such as the quarton qubit or the kinemon qubit. We use these results to theoretically explore the single-qubit gate fidelity and coherence times across the parameter space of qubits with a single-well potential. We find that the gate fidelity can be optimized by tuning the Hamiltonian to (1) a high qubit mode impedance of 1-2 kQ, (2) a low qubit frequency of 1 GHz, (3) and a perfect cancellation of the linear inductance and the Josephson inductance attained at a flux bias of half flux quantum. According to our theoretical analysis, the proposed qubit parameters have the potential to enhance the single-qubit gate fidelity of the unimon beyond 99.99%, even without significant improvements to the dielectric quality factor or the flux noise density measured for the first unimon qubits. Furthermore, we compare unimon, transmon, and fluxonium qubits in terms of their energy spectra and qubit coherence subject to dielectric loss and 1/f flux noise in order to highlight the advantages and limitations of each qubit type.

TI Generation of spin-squeezed states using dipole-coupled spins
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW APPLIED
AB Spins in solids and molecules are promising for applications of quantum sensing technology. The sensitivity of quantum sensing depends on how precisely spin observables can be determined in the measurement and is intrinsically limited by the uncertainties of the observables. The use of a spin-squeezed state in a quantum sensor can reduce the uncertainty below the standard quantum limit when combined with an appropriate measurement procedure. Here, we discuss a simulation study of the generation of a squeezed state in an interacting spin system. We show that a spin system coupled via the magnetic dipole interaction can create a squeezed state. Model systems to realize the spin squeezing experimentally are also discussed. In addition, we find that a squeezed state is a type of entangled state. The present work paves the way to realizing a squeezed state using a spin system to build a quantum sensor network with improved sensitivity and to use it for the detection of quantum entanglement.

TI Rydberg-Rydberg interaction strengths and dipole blockade radii in the
   presence of Förster resonances
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB Achieving a substantial blockade radius is crucial for developing scalable and efficient quantum communication and computation. In this theoretical study, we present the enhancement of the Rydberg blockade radius by utilizing Forster resonance. This phenomenon occurs when the energy difference between two initial Rydberg states closely matches that between the corresponding final Rydberg states, giving rise to a resonant energy transfer process. We employ quantum defect theory to numerically calculate the 87Rb-87Rb Rydberg atomic pair, enabling us to accurately estimate the van der Waals interaction. Our investigation reveals that when the principal quantum numbers of two Rydberg states differ only slightly, the Forster transition is rarely able to achieve a large blockade radius. However, in cases where the principal quantum numbers differ significantly, we substantially improve the Rydberg blockade radius. Most notably, we identify transition channels exhibiting an extensive blockade radius, surpassing 50 mu m. This significant increase in the blockade radius enables larger-scale quantum operations and advances quantum technologies, with broad implications for achieving long-range quantum entanglement and robust quantum processes.

TI Seedless extractors for device-independent quantum cryptography
SO QUANTUM
AB Device-independent (DI) quantum cryptography aims at providing secure cryptography with minimal trust in, or characterisation of, the underlying quantum devices. A key step in DI protocols is randomness extraction (or privacy amplification), which typically requires a seed of additional bits with sufficient entropy and statistical independence from any bits generated during the protocol. In this work, we propose a method for extraction in DI protocols that does not require a seed and is secure against computationally unbounded quantum adversaries. The core idea is to use the Bell violation of the raw data, rather than its min-entropy, as the extractor promise. We present a complete security proof in a model where the experiment uses memoryless measurement devices acting on an arbitrary joint (across all rounds) state. Our results mark a first step in this alternative, seedless, approach to extraction in DI protocols.

TI FASQuiC: Flexible Architecture for Scalable Spin Qubit Control
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON QUANTUM ENGINEERING
AB As scaling becomes a key issue for large-scale quantum computing, hardware control systems will become increasingly costly in resources. This article presents a compact direct digital synthesis architecture for signal generation adapted for spin qubits that is scalable in terms of waveform accuracy and the number of synchronized channels. The architecture can produce programmable combinations of ramps, frequency combs, and arbitrary waveform generation (AWG) at 5 GS/s, with a worst-case digital feedback latency of 76.8 ns. The field-programmable gate array (FPGA)-based system is highly configurable and takes advantage of bitstream switching to achieve the high flexibility required for scalable calibration. The architecture also provides GHz rate, multiplexed, in-phase and quadrature component, single-side band modulation for scalable reflectometry. This architecture has been validated in hardware on a Xilinx ZCU111 FPGA demonstrating the mixing of complex signals and the quality of the frequency comb generation for multiplexed control and measurement. The key benefits of this design are the increase of controllability of ramps at the digital-to-analog converter (DAC) frequency and the reduction in memory requirements by several orders of magnitude compared with existing AWG-based architectures. The hardware for a single channel is very compact, 2% of ZCU111 logic resources for one DAC lane in the default configuration, leaving significant circuit resources for integrated feedback, calibration, and quantum error correction.

TI Quantum transfer of interacting qubits
SO NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB The transfer of quantum information between different locations is key to many quantum information processing tasks. Whereas, the transfer of a single qubit state has been extensively investigated, the transfer of a many-body system configuration has insofar remained elusive. We address the problem of transferring the state of n interacting qubits. Both the exponentially increasing Hilbert space dimension, and the presence of interactions significantly scale-up the complexity of achieving high-fidelity transfer. By employing tools from random matrix theory and using the formalism of quantum dynamical maps, we derive a general expression for the average and the variance of the fidelity of an arbitrary quantum state transfer protocol for n interacting qubits. Finally, by adopting a weak-coupling scheme in a spin chain, we obtain the explicit conditions for high-fidelity transfer of three and four interacting qubits.

TI Using Machine Learning to Understand the Causes of Quantum Decoherence
   in Solution-Phase Bond-Breaking Reactions
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY LETTERS
AB Decoherence is a fundamental phenomenon that occurs when an entangled quantum state interacts with its environment, leading to collapse of the wave function. The inevitability of decoherence provides one of the most intrinsic limits of quantum computing. However, there has been little study of the precise chemical motions from the environment that cause decoherence. Here, we use quantum molecular dynamics simulations to explore the photodissociation of Na-2(+) in liquid Ar, in which solvent fluctuations induce decoherence and thus determine the products of chemical bond breaking. We use machine learning to characterize the solute-solvent environment as a high-dimensional feature space that allows us to predict when and onto which photofragment the bonding electron will localize. We find that reaching a requisite photofragment separation and experiencing out-of-phase solvent collisions underlie decoherence during chemical bond breaking. Our work highlights the utility of machine learning for interpreting complex solution-phase chemical processes as well as identifies the molecular underpinnings of decoherence.

TI Using Cascade in quantum key distribution
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW APPLIED
AB We point out a critical flaw in the analysis of quantum key distribution protocols that employ the twoall two-way communication that occurs during the Cascade protocol. We present a straightforward and elegant alternative approach that addresses this flaw and produces valid key rates. We exemplify our new approach by comparing its key rates with those generated using older, incorrect approaches, for qubit BB84 and decoy-state BB84 protocols. We show that, in many practically relevant situations, our rectified approach produces the same key rate as older, incorrect approaches. However, in other scenarios, our approach produces valid key rates that are lower, highlighting the importance of properly accounting for all two-way communication during Cascade.

TI Reconfigurable metasurfaces to realize BB84 protocol for wireless
   quantum communication
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB Metasurfaces showcase unique abilities to arbitrarily manipulate the amplitude, phase, and polarization of electromagnetic (EM) waves, facilitating their application in wireless communication. In the propagation of EM waves, traditional methods cause severe security concerns in channel/deciphering under eavesdropping. Fortunately, quantum communication, based on quantum key distribution (QKD) of the BB84 protocol, endows the transmission with high security. However, the conventional QKD technology relies on complicated manipulation of a single photon and is prone to channel collapses once an eavesdropper intervenes. Furthermore, the merit of the BB84 protocol has not been realized in metasurfaces as a transmission channel. Here, we, for the first time as far as we know, used metasurfaces to implement wireless transmission of quantum information via the first QKD protocol, BB84. These metasurfaces provided four conjugated quantum states to concretely demonstrate the BB84 protocol through a conveyor-type switching method. High-fidelity holographic results were obtained at similar to 10 GHz and beyond in both experiment and simulation. As compared with traditional QKD technology, our BB84 protocol based on metasurfaces is more stable and secure in information transmission. In addition, the metasurfaces have electromechanical switchable mode, empowering them to have multidisciplinary functions in wireless communication, e.g., program-controlled antennas, intelligent reflectors, and variable metalens.

TI Gaussian-modulated continuous-variable quantum key distribution based on
   untrusted entanglement source br
SO ACTA PHYSICA SINICA
AB In a practical quantum communication system, the security of signal source of continuous-variablequantum key distribution may be jeopardized due to device flaws and hidden attacks. In this paper, animproved scheme for Gaussian-modulated continuous-variable quantum key distribution based on an untrustedentangled source is proposed. In particular, the entanglement source is placed in an untrusted quantum channelto simulate that it is controlled by an eavesdropper, thereby verifying the security of Gaussian-modulatedcontinuous-variable quantum key distribution in a complex environment. This work in detail analyzes theinfluence of untrusted entanglement source on practical Gaussian-modulated continuous-variable quantum keydistribution system, and the numerical simulation shows that the performance of Gaussian-modulatedcontinuous-variable quantum key distribution will dramatically decrease once the entanglement source hasmoved out of the sender, and it will slightly rise as the untrusted entanglement source slowly moves away fromthe sender. This paper further introduces two kinds of optical amplifiers, which are phase-sensitive amplifier andphase-insensitive amplifier, to compensate for the imperfection of the coherent detector. These amplifiers arebeneficial to enhancing the quantum efficiency of the receiver's detector. Specifically, the security key rate ofGaussian-modulated continuous-variable quantum key distribution with homodyne detection can be wellimproved by phase-sensitive amplifier, and the security key rate of Gaussian-modulated continuous-variablequantum key distribution with heterodyne detection can be well improved by phase-insensitive amplifier. Tosummary, this paper proposes a scheme for Gaussian-modulated continuous-variable quantum key distributionwith untrusted entanglement source, experimental results show that the proposed scheme can generate securequantum keys even if the Gaussian entanglement source is untrusted, and the two optical amplifiers caneffectively improve the quantum efficiency of the detector at the receiver. This work aims to promote thepractical process of the Gaussian-modulated continuous-variable quantum key distribution system and providetheoretical guidance for the practical implementation and application of the Gaussian-modulated continuous-variable quantum key distribution system.

TI High temperature spin selectivity in a quantum dot qubit using reservoir
   spin accumulation
SO NPJ QUANTUM INFORMATION
AB Employing spins in quantum dots for fault-tolerant quantum computing in large-scale qubit arrays with on-chip control electronics requires high-fidelity qubit operation at elevated temperature. This poses a challenge for single spin initialization and readout. Existing schemes rely on Zeeman splitting or Pauli spin blockade with typical energy scales of 0.1 or 1 meV for electron-based qubits, so that sufficient fidelity is obtained only at temperatures around or below 0.1 or 1 K, respectively. Here we describe a method to achieve high temperature spin selectivity in a quantum dot using a reservoir with a spin accumulation, which deterministically sets the spin of a single electron on the dot. Since spin accumulation as large as 10 meV is achievable in silicon, spin selection with electrically adjustable error rates below 10-4 is possible even in a liquid He bath at 4 K. Via the reservoir spin accumulation, induced and controlled by a nearby ferromagnet, classical information (magnetization direction) is mapped onto a spin qubit. These features provide the prospect of spin qubit operation at elevated temperatures and connect the worlds of quantum computing and spintronics.

SO LASER & PHOTONICS REVIEWS
AB Multi-wavelength quantum light sources are extremely desired in establishing communication links among multiple users for realizing quantum networks. Despite recent impressive advances, developing such a quantum light source with high quality remains challenging. Here a multi-wavelength quantum light source using a silicon nitride micro-ring with a free spectral range of 200 GHz is demonstrated. The generation of eight-wavelength-paired photon pairs is ensured in a wavelength range of 25.6 nm. With device optimization and noise-rejecting filters, this source enables the generation of heralded single-photons at a rate of 62 kHz with g(h)((2))(0)=0.014 +/- 0.001 and the generation of energy-time entangled photons with a visibility of 99.39 +/- 0.45% in the Franson interferometer. These results, at room temperature and telecom wavelength, in a CMOS-compatible platform, represent an important step toward integrated quantum photonic devices, which pave the way for realizing a large-scale quantum network.

TI Analog Quantum Simulation of the Dynamics of Open Quantum Systems with
   Quantum Dots and Microelectronic Circuits
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB We introduce a general setup for the analog quantum simulation of the dynamics of open quantum sys-tems based on semiconductor quantum dots electrically connected to an array of quantum RLC electronic circuits. The dots are chosen to be in the regime of spin-charge hybridization to enhance their sensitivity to the RLC circuits while mitigating the detrimental effects of unwanted noise. In this context, we establish an experimentally realizable map between the hybrid system and a qubit coupled to thermal harmonic envi-ronments of arbitrary complexity that enables the analog quantum simulation of open quantum systems. We assess the utility of the simulator by numerically exact emulations that indicate that the experimental setup can faithfully mimic the intended target even in the presence of its natural inherent noise. We fur-ther provide a detailed analysis of the physical requirements on the quantum dots and the RLC circuits needed to experimentally realize this proposal that indicates that the simulator can be created with exist-ing technology. The approach can exactly capture the effects of highly structured non-Markovian quantum environments typical of photosynthesis and chemical dynamics and it offers clear potential advantages over conventional and even quantum computation. The proposal opens up a general path for effective quantum dynamics simulations based on semiconductor quantum dots.

TI Towards Early Fault Tolerance on a 2 x N Array of Qubits Equipped
   with Shuttling
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB It is well understood that a two-dimensional grid of locally interacting qubits is a promising platform for achieving fault-tolerant quantum computing. However in the near future, it may prove less challenging to develop lower-dimensional structures. In this paper, we show that such constrained architectures can also support fault tolerance; specifically we explore a 2 x N array of qubits where the interactions between non-neighboring qubits are enabled by shuttling the logical information along the rows of the array. Despite the apparent constraints of this setup, we demonstrate that error correction is possible and identify the classes of codes that are naturally suited to this platform. Focusing on silicon spin qubits as a practical example of qubits believed to meet our requirements, we provide a protocol for achieving full universal quantum computation with the surface code, while also addressing the additional constraints that are specific to a silicon spin-qubit device. Through numerical simulations, we evaluate the performance of this architecture using a realistic noise model, demonstrating that both surface code and more complex quantum low-density parity-check codes efficiently suppress gate and shuttling noise to a level that allows for the execution of quantum algorithms within the classically intractable regime. This work thus brings us one step closer to the execution of quantum algorithms that outperform classical machines.

TI Genetic optimization of quantum annealing
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB The study of optimal control of quantum annealing by modulating the pace of evolution and by introducing a counterdiabatic potential has gained significant attention in recent times. In this work, we present a numerical approach based on genetic algorithms to improve the performance of quantum annealing, which evades the Landau-Zener transitions to navigate to the ground state of the final Hamiltonian with high probability. We optimize the annealing schedules starting from the polynomial ansatz by treating their coefficients as chromosomes of the genetic algorithm. We also explore shortcuts to adiabaticity by computing a practically feasible k-local optimal driving operator, showing that even for k = 1 we achieve substantial improvement of the fidelity over the standard annealing solution. With these genetically optimized annealing schedules and/or optimal driving operators, we are able to perform quantum annealing in relatively short timescales and with higher fidelity compared to traditional approaches.

TI Controlled beam splitter gate transparent to dominant ancilla errors
SO QUANTUM SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB In hybrid circuit quantum electrodynamics (QED) architectures containing both ancilla qubits and bosonic modes, a controlled beam splitter (cBS) gate is a powerful resource. It can be used to create (up to a controlled-parity operation) an ancilla-controlled SWAP gate acting on two bosonic modes. This is the essential element required to execute the 'swap test' for purity, prepare quantum non-Gaussian entanglement and directly measure nonlinear functionals of quantum states. It also constitutes an important gate for hybrid discrete/continuous-variable quantum computation. We propose a new realization of a hybrid cSWAP utilizing 'Kerr-cat' qubits-anharmonic oscillators subject to strong two-photon driving. The Kerr-cat is used to generate a controlled-phase beam splitter operation. When combined with an ordinary beam splitter one obtains a cBS and from this a cSWAP. The strongly biased error channel for the Kerr-cat has phase flips which dominate over bit flips. This yields important benefits for the cSWAP gate which becomes non-destructive and transparent to the dominate error. Our proposal is straightforward to implement and, based on currently existing experimental parameters, should achieve cBS gates with high fidelities comparable to current ordinary beam-splitter operations available in circuit QED.

TI Secure Anonymous Conferencing in Quantum Networks
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB Users of quantum networks can securely communicate via so-called (quantum) conference key agreement-making their identities publicly known. In certain circumstances, however, communicating users demand anonymity. Here, we introduce a security framework for anonymous conference key agreement with different levels of anonymity, which is inspired by the epsilon-security of quantum key distribution. We present efficient and noise-tolerant protocols exploiting multipartite Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) states and prove their security in the finite-key regime. We analyze the performance of our protocols in noisy and lossy quantum networks and compare with protocols that only use bipartite entanglement to achieve the same functionalities. Our simulations show that GHZ-based protocols can outperform protocols based on bipartite entanglement and that the advantage increases for protocols with stronger anonymity requirements. Our results strongly advocate the use of multipartite entanglement for cryptographic tasks involving several users.

TI A Pure and Indistinguishable Single-Photon Source at Telecommunication
   Wavelength
SO ADVANCED QUANTUM TECHNOLOGIES
AB On-demand single-photon sources emitting pure and indistinguishable photons at the telecommunication wavelength are critical assets toward the deployment of fiber-based quantum networks. Indeed, single photons may serve as flying qubits, allowing communication of quantum information over long distances. Self-assembled InAs quantum dots embedded in GaAs constitute an excellent nearly deterministic source of high-quality single photons, but the vast majority of sources operate in the 900-950 nm wavelength range, precluding their adoption in a quantum network. A quantum frequency conversion scheme is presented here for converting single photons from quantum dots to the telecommunication C band, around 1550 nm, achieving 40.8% end-to-end efficiency, while maintaining both high purity and a high degree of indistinguishability during conversion with measured values of g((2))(0) = 2.4% and V-(corr) = 94.8%, respectively.

TI Generating Discorrelated States for Quantum Information Protocols by
   Coherent Multimode Photon Addition
SO ADVANCED QUANTUM TECHNOLOGIES
AB It is demonstrated that the recently developed technique of delocalized single photon addition may generate discorrelation, a new joint statistical property of multimode quantum light states, whereby the number of photons in each mode can take any value individually, but two modes together never exhibit the same. By coherently adding a single photon to two identical coherent states of light in different temporal modes, the first experimental observation of discorrelation is provided. The capability of manipulating this statistical property has applications in scenarios involving the secure distribution of information among untrusted parties, like in the so-called "mental poker" games.

AB (Received accepted April published April 2023) Quantum entanglement between the two W bosons resulting from the decay of a Higgs boson may be investigated in the dilepton channel H -> WW -> e nu e nu using laboratory-frame observables that only involve the charged leptons e = e, mu. The dilepton invariant mass distribution, already measured by the ATLAS and CMS Collaborations at the LHC, can be used to observe the quantum entanglement of the WW pair with a statistical sensitivity of 7 sigma with run 2 data, and of 6 sigma when including theoretical systematics. As a by-product, the relation between W rest frame (four-dimensional) angular distributions, H -> WW decay amplitudes, and spin correlation coefficients, is written down.

TI Analog Information Decoding of Bosonic Quantum Low-Density Parity-Check
   Codes
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB Quantum error correction is crucial for scalable quantum information-processing applications. Traditional discrete -variable quantum codes that use multiple two -level systems to encode logical information can be hardware intensive. An alternative approach is provided by bosonic codes, which use the infinitedimensional Hilbert space of harmonic oscillators to encode quantum information. Two promising features of bosonic codes are that syndrome measurements are natively analog and that they can be concatenated with discrete -variable codes. In this work, we propose novel decoding methods that explicitly exploit the analog syndrome information obtained from the bosonic qubit readout in a concatenated architecture. Our methods are versatile and can be generally applied to any bosonic code concatenated with a quantum lowdensity parity -check (QLDPC) code. Furthermore, we introduce the concept of quasi -single shot protocols as a novel approach that significantly reduces the number of repeated syndrome measurements required when decoding under phenomenological noise. To realize the protocol, we present the first implementation of time -domain decoding with the overlapping window method for general QLDPC codes and a novel analog single -shot decoding method. Our results lay the foundation for general decoding algorithms using analog information and demonstrate promising results in the direction of fault -tolerant quantum computation with concatenated bosonic-QLDPC codes.

TI BBM92 quantum key distribution over a free space dusty channel of 200
   meters
SO JOURNAL OF OPTICS
AB Free-space quantum communication assumes importance as it is a precursor for satellite-based quantum communication needed for secure key distribution over longer distances. Prepare and measure quantum key distribution (QKD) protocols like BB84 consider the satellite as a trusted device, which is fraught with security threat looking at the current trend for satellite-based optical communication. Therefore, entanglement-based protocols must be preferred, so that one can consider the satellite as an untrusted device. The current work reports the effect of atmospheric aerosols on the key rate obtained with BBM92 QKD protocol, an entanglement-based QKD protocol over 200 m distance, using an indigenous facility developed at Physical Research Laboratory (PRL), Ahmedabad, India. Our results show that concentration and extinction coefficient of atmospheric aerosols play a major role in influencing the observed sift key rate, and eventually, the secure key rate. Such experiments are important to validate the models to account for the atmospheric effects on the key rates achieved through satellite-based QKD.

TI Compact superconducting transmon qubit circuits made of ultrathin NbN
SO APPLIED PHYSICS LETTERS
AB We design and fabricate a compact superconducting qubit circuit made of nanothick NbN film on a high-resistivity silicon substrate, carrying seven transmon qubits. By comparing with the conventional superconducting qubit circuits made of superconducting films with hundred-nanometer thickness, our superconducting qubit circuit has much smaller size in the readout circuit, whose resonator length is only about 1/20 of that in a conventional superconducting circuit. Transmons are measured and characterized in the frequency and time domains with different flux bias. The transition frequency f01 can be adjusted in the range of several GHz. The qubit circuits made of such nanothick material with high kinetic inductance are promising in the integration of quantum circuits.(c) 2023 Author(s).

TI Using Bifluxon Tunneling to Protect the Fluxonium Qubit
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW X
AB Encoding quantum information in quantum states with disjoint wave-function support and noise- insensitive energies is the key behind the idea of qubit protection. While fully protected qubits are expected to offer exponential protection against both energy relaxation and pure dephasing, simpler circuits may grant partial protection with currently achievable parameters. Here, we study a fluxonium circuit in which the wave functions are engineered to minimize their overlap while benefiting from a first-order-insensitive flux sweet spot. Taking advantage of a large superinductance (L 1 mu H), our circuit incorporates a resonant tunneling mechanism at zero external flux that couples states with the same fluxon parity, thus enabling bifluxon tunneling. The states 0) and 1) are encoded in wave functions with parities 0 and 1, respectively, ensuring a minimal form of protection against relaxation. Two-tone spectroscopy reveals the energy-level structure of the circuit and the presence of 4 pi quantum-phase slips between different potential wells corresponding to m = + 1 fluxons, which can be precisely described by a simple fluxonium Hamiltonian or by an effective bifluxon Hamiltonian. Despite suboptimal fabrication, the measured relaxation (T1 = 177 + 3 mu s) and dephasing ( T E 2 = 75 + 5 mu s) times not only demonstrate the relevance of our approach but also open an alternative direction toward quantum computing using partially protected fluxonium qubits.

TI From strong to weak interaction: reconciling SQUID and μSQUID-EPR data
   in anomalous Co(ii) dimers
SO INORGANIC CHEMISTRY FRONTIERS
AB Magnetic molecules have been proposed as scaffolds for novel quantum technologies, ranging from quantum sensing and quantum memory to multilevel quantum bits (qudits) and fault-tolerant quantum computation. Integration of magnetic molecules into cutting-edge applications hinges on a deep understanding and tunability of their spin states. To date, the strategic manipulation of the local environment of the ion and careful selection of the magnetic core have enabled the desired tunability and scalability of the spin states. For such goals, however, extracting the anisotropic parameters that dictate the characteristics of the Spin Hamiltonian is challenging, especially for molecules consisting of multiple magnetic cores. We address these challenges by studying two cobalt(ii) dinuclear systems, complicated by inherent spin-orbit coupling. We explore the magnetic properties of these systems in two temperature regimes: (i) at sub-Kelvin temperatures employing single crystals at 30 mK using a unique mu SQUID-EPR technique that examines the microwave absorption peaks in the magnetisation data and their variation with field angle and frequency; and (ii) in bulk employing convectional SQUID magnetometry above 2 K i.e., chi MT(T) and M(H). Unexpectedly, sub-Kelvin temperature investigations reveal a negligible interaction, whereas the SQUID data reveal a much stronger interaction between the Co(ii) ions. An understanding of these data is developed based on a strong coupling model and the coupling of two moieties with a spin-effective ground state.

TI Qudit noisy stabilizer formalism
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB We introduce the qudit noisy stabilizer formalism, a framework for efficiently describing the evolution of stabilizer states in prime-power dimensions subject to generalized Pauli-diagonal noise under Clifford operations and generalized Pauli measurements. For arbitrary dimensions, the formalism remains applicable, though restricted to a subset of stabilizer states and operations. The computational complexity scales linearly with the number of qudits in the initial state and exponentially with the number of qudits in the final state. This ensures that when noisy qudit stabilizer states evolve via generalized Pauli measurements and Clifford operations to generate multipartite entangled states of a few qudits, their description remains efficient. We demonstrate this by analyzing the generation of a generalized Bell pair from a noisy linear cluster state subject to two distinct noise sources acting on each of the qudits.

AB Path entanglement is an essential resource for photonic quantum information processing, including in quantum computing, quantum communication, and quantum sensing. In this work, we experimentally study the generation and verification of bipartite path-entangled states using single photons produced by a nitrogen vacancy center within a nanodiamond. We perform a range of measurements to characterize the photons being generated and verify the presence of path entanglement. The experiment is performed using continuous-wave laser excitation and a novel, to our knowledge, state-generation 'time-window' method. This approach to path entanglement verification is different from previous work as it does not make use of a pulsed laser excitation source. (c) 2024 Optica Publishing Group.

Quantum Markov chain Monte Carlo has been proposed as a method for accelerating a broad class of computational problems, including problems of pharmaceutical interest. Here we investigate the prospects of quantum advantage via this approach, by applying it to the problem of modelling antibody structure, a crucial task in drug development. To minimize the resources required while maintaining pharmaceutical-level accuracy, we propose a specific encoding of molecular dihedral angles into registers of qubits and a method for implementing, in quantum superposition, a Markov chain Monte Carlo update step based on a classical all-atom force field. We give the first detailed analysis of the resources required to solve a problem of industrial size and relevance and find that, though the time and space requirements of using a quantum computer in this way are considerable, continued technological improvements could bring the required resources within reach in the future.

AB This study demonstrates entanglement can be exclusively constituted by quantum Fourier transform (QFT) blocks. A bridge between entanglement and QFT will allow incorporating a spectral analysis to the already traditional temporal approach of entanglement, which will result in the development of new more performant, and fault-tolerant protocols to be used in quantum computing as well as quantum communication, with particular emphasis in the future quantum Internet.

TI Efficient Floating Point Arithmetic for Quantum Computers
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB One of the major promises of quantum computing is the realization of SIMD (single instruction - multiple data) operations using the phenomenon of superposition. Since the dimension of the state space grows exponentially with the number of qubits, we can easily reach situations where we pay less than a single quantum gate per data point for data-processing instructions, which would be rather expensive in classical computing. Formulating such instructions in terms of quantum gates, however, still remains a challenging task. Laying out the foundational functions for more advanced data-processing is therefore a subject of paramount importance for advancing the realm of quantum computing. In this paper, we introduce the formalism of encoding so called-semi-boolean polynomials. As it turns out, arithmetic Z/2(n)Z ring operations can be formulated as semi-boolean polynomial evaluations, which allows convenient generation of unsigned integer arithmetic quantum circuits. For arithmetic evaluations, the resulting algorithm has been known as Fourier-arithmetic. We extend this type of algorithm with additional features, such as ancilla-free in-place multiplication and integer coefficient polynomial evaluation. Furthermore, we introduce a tailor-made method for encoding signed integers succeeded by an encoding for arbitrary floating-point numbers. This representation of floating-point numbers and their processing can be applied to any quantum algorithm that performs unsigned modular integer arithmetic. We discuss some further performance enhancements of the semi boolean polynomial encoder and finally supply a complexity estimation. The application of our methods to a 32-bit unsigned integer multiplication demonstrated a 90% circuit depth reduction compared to carry-ripple approaches.

TI Free-space model for a balloon-based quantum network
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Long-distance communication is one of the main bottlenecks in the development of quantum communication networks. Free-space communication is a way to circumvent exponential fiber loss and to allow longer communication distances. Satellite nodes are the main devices currently studied for free-space communication, but they come with downsides such as high cost and low availability. In this work, we study an alternative to satellites, namely, aerial platforms such as high-altitude balloons. We provide a loss model to simulate the channel efficiency of balloon-to-ground, ground-to-balloon, and balloon-to-balloon communication channels, considering a large set of hardware parameters. We perform a parameter exploration to exhibit important trade-offs in these channels, as well as simulations of different quantum key distribution network architectures including balloon nodes. We demonstrate that balloons are a realistic alternative to satellites for free-space communications in national network architectures.

SO FRONTIERS IN RESEARCH METRICS AND ANALYTICS
AB The state-of-the-art quantum technologies leverage the unique principles of quantum mechanics, which include quantization, uncertainty principle, interference, entanglement and decoherence, to produce useful devices and scientific advancements not possible with classical technologies. As a result, quantum technologies, in particular, offer specific advantages that make communications networks secure and unbreakable and devices with unprecedented levels of accuracy, responsiveness, reliability, scalability and efficiency than classical emerging technologies. These capabilities can contribute significantly to addressing energy, agriculture, climate change, national security, healthcare, education and economic growth challenges. Unfortunately, these developments in these areas have not been evenly distributed between the Global North and the Global South, inadvertently creating a societal and economic gap. Closing this gap is critical to creating a more inclusive and sustainable future for all, thus delivering key sustainable goals. Therefore, to close this gap, this article proposes a quantum diplomacy framework as a means to deliver science diplomacy. Moreover, we discuss how emerging quantum technologies could profoundly impact all 17 United Nations Sustainable Development Goals. We consider this work a timely and vital intervention to prevent the gap from increasing.

TI Oscillating photonic Bell state from a semiconductor quantum dot for
   quantum key distribution
SO COMMUNICATIONS PHYSICS
AB An on-demand source of bright entangled photon pairs is desirable for quantum key distribution (QKD) and quantum repeaters. The leading candidate to generate such pairs is based on spontaneous parametric down-conversion (SPDC) in non-linear crystals. However, its pair extraction efficiency is limited to 0.1% when operating at near-unity fidelity due to multiphoton emission at high brightness. Quantum dots in photonic nanostructures can in principle overcome this limit, but the devices with high entanglement fidelity (99%) have low pair extraction efficiency (0.01%). Here, we show a measured peak entanglement fidelity of 97.5% +/- 0.8% and pair extraction efficiency of 0.65% from an InAsP quantum dot in an InP photonic nanowire waveguide. We show that the generated oscillating two-photon Bell state can establish a secure key for peer-to-peer QKD. Using our time-resolved QKD scheme alleviates the need to remove the quantum dot energy splitting of the intermediate exciton states in the biexciton-exciton cascade.
   Spontaneous parametric down-conversion, the standard technique for generating entangled photons, is limited by low pair extraction efficiencies at near-unity fidelity. The authors show quantum dots in nanowires efficiently emit an oscillating state with near-unity entanglement fidelity and propose a time-resolved quantum key distribution protocol.

TI Rigorous convergence condition for quantum annealing
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICS A-MATHEMATICAL AND THEORETICAL
AB We derive a generic bound on the rate of decrease of transverse field for quantum annealing to converge to the ground state of a generic Ising model when quantum annealing is formulated as an infinite-time process. Our theorem is based on a rigorous upper bound on the excitation probability in the infinite-time limit and is a mathematically rigorous counterpart of a previously known result derived only from the leading-order term of the asymptotic expansion of adiabatic condition. Since our theorem gives a sufficient condition of convergence for a generic transverse-field Ising model, any specific problem may allow a better, faster, control of the coefficient.

TI Characterising higher-order phase correlations in gain-switched laser
   sources with application to quantum key distribution
SO EPJ QUANTUM TECHNOLOGY
AB Multi-photon emissions in laser sources represent a serious threat for the security of quantum key distribution (QKD). While the decoy-state technique allows to solve this problem, it requires uniform phase randomisation of the emitted pulses. However, gain-switched lasers operating at high repetition rates do not fully satisfy this requirement, as residual photons in the laser cavity introduce correlations between the phases of consecutive pulses. Here, we introduce experimental schemes to characterise the phase probability distribution of the emitted pulses, and demonstrate that an optimisation task over interferometric measures suffices in determining the impact of arbitrary order correlations, which ultimately establishes the security level of the implementation according to recent security proofs. We expect that our findings may find usages beyond QKD as well.

TI Broadband multi-channel quantum noise suppression and phase-sensitive
   modulation based on entangled beam
SO CHINESE PHYSICS B
AB We present a theoretical scheme for broadband multi-channel quantum noise suppression and phase-sensitive modulation of continuous variables in a coupled resonant system with quantum entanglement properties. The effects of different coupling strengths, pumping power in suppressing quantum noise and controlling the width of quantum interference channels are analyzed carefully. Furthermore, quantum noise suppression at quadrature amplitude is obtained with phase-sensitive modulation. It shows that the entanglement strength of the output field and the quantum noise suppression effect can be enhanced significantly by a strong pumping filed due to interaction of pumping light with the nonlinear crystal. The full width at half maxima (FWHM) of the noise curve at the resonant peak (Delta = 0 MHz) is broadened up to 2.17 times compared to the single cavity. In the strong coupling resonant system, the FWHM at Delta = 0 MHz (Delta = +/- 3.1 MHz) is also broadened up to 1.27 (3.53) times compared to the weak coupling resonant system case. The multi-channel quantum interference creates an electromagnetically induced transparent-like line shape, which can be used to improve the transmission efficiency and stability of wave packets in quantum information processing and quantum memory.

TI Adaptive bandwidth management for entanglement distribution in quantum

AB Flexible grid wavelength division multiplexing is a powerful tool in lightwave communications to maximize spectral efficiency. In the emerging field of quantum networking, the need for effective resource provisioning is particularly acute, given the generally lower power levels, higher sensitivity to loss, and inapplicability of optical detection and retransmission. In this letter, we leverage flex grid technology to demonstrate reconfigurable distribution of quantum entanglement in a four-user tabletop network. By adaptively partitioning bandwidth with a single wavelength-selective switch, we successfully equalize two-party coincidence rates that initially differ by over two orders of magnitude. Our scalable approach introduces loss that is fixed with the number of users, offering a practical path for the establishment and management of quality-of-service guarantees in large quantum networks.

AB Quantum computing in the Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) era faces significant challenges due to the limitations in quantum gate fidelity and elevated error rates, which impede the successful execution of large-scale quantum circuits. One major source of errors in quantum computing is 'coherence errors', which arise from the idle time during circuit execution. Specifically, factors such as uneven gate operations, hardware limitations, and qubit connectivity constraints collectively contribute to the formation of 'holes' in quantum circuits, leading to 'idle qubits'. These idle periods, in turn, increase noise and error rates, thus negatively impacting the overall reliability of quantum circuits' outputs.
   Dynamic Decoupling' involves implementing a series of single-qubit gates during the idle periods of each qubit, with the goal of minimizing coherence errors while incurring (less impactful) gate errors. Unlike previous approaches that require executing multiple circuit versions to achieve optimal dynamic decoupling, we present, in this work, an innovative method that characterizes the system just 'once' and enhances circuit performance based on this single characterization. This study introduces a practical technique for minimizing coherence errors by employing dynamic decoupling (using an X-Y-X-Y gate sequence) based on the slack lengths of the quantum circuit holes. More specifically, our approach focuses on optimizing idle qubits and precisely calculating the duration of these idle periods (referred to as 'slacks') for a more efficient application of dynamic decoupling.
   Our proposed method results in PST (probability of successful trial) improvements of 1.15x for small-scale benchmarks, 1.1x for medium-scale benchmarks, and 1.2x for large-scale benchmarks, when applied to the Qiskit and QASM benchmarks (a quantum benchmark suite for NISQ machines), in comparison to a state-of-the-art technique, while requiring 89% fewer characterization experiments. Compared to no dynamic decoupling and existing dynamic decoupling-based baselines, our approach achieves 1.6x and 1.4x better PST, respectively, on average.

TI High-fidelity single-qubit gates of a strong driven singlet-triplet
   qubit
SO ACTA PHYSICA SINICA
AB Semiconductor quantum dot qubits are one of the most promising candidates for quantum computing. Among them, singlet-triplet qubits have attracted much attention due to their excellent properties of all-electric control and accurate readout. To improve qubit immunity to charge noise, strong driving pulses are usually introduced to make operation as fast as possible. However, the complex dynamics induced by strong driving pulses make the rotating wave approximation inapplicable and hinder the implementation of high-fidelity qubit operation. In this work, we present a method of utilizing simple quadrature pulses to correct errors of high frequency oscillatory terms induced by strong driving. A scheme to obtain these pulses is proposed based on a full quantization of the system and derivative removal by adiabatic gate (DRAG) theory, as the former clarifies the elementary processes of strong driving effects and enables the latter to find correction pulse shapes. The numerical simulation results show that, a NOT gate with 99.99% fidelity and gate time as short as 2 ns can be achieved with the help of the control pulses of this method, which indicates that the control error brought by strong driving is no longer a limiting factor. In particular, NOT gate fidelity higher than 99.9% is achievable even when the charge noise is at a level of 2 mu eV. Notice that this method can be applied to any resonant driving single-qubit rotation but not just NOT gates. Therefore, our approach will facilitate qubits to realize fast, high-fidelity single-qubit gates under charge noise.

TI REWRITING AND COMPLETENESS OF SUM-OVER-PATHS IN DYADIC FRAGMENTS OF
   QUANTUM COMPUTING
SO LOGICAL METHODS IN COMPUTER SCIENCE
AB The "Sum -Over -Paths" formalism is a way to symbolically manipulate linear maps that describe quantum systems, and is a tool that is used in formal verification of such systems. We give here a new set of rewrite rules for the formalism, and show that it is complete for "Toffoli-Hadamard", the simplest approximately universal fragment of quantum mechanics. We show that the rewriting is terminating, but not confluent (which is expected from the universality of the fragment). We do so using the connection between Sum -over -Paths and graphical language ZH-calculus, and also show how the axiomatisation translates into the latter. We provide generalisations of the presented rewrite rules, that can prove useful when trying to reduce terms in practice, and we show how to graphically make sense of these new rules. We show how to enrich the rewrite system to reach completeness for the dyadic fragments of quantum computation, used in particular in the Quantum Fourier Transform, and obtained by adding phase gates with dyadic multiples of pi to the Toffoli-Hadamard gateset. Finally, we show how to perform sums and concatenation of arbitrary terms, something which is not native in a system designed for analysing gate -based quantum computation, but necessary when considering Hamiltonian -based quantum computation.

TI Large spin-shuttling oscillations enabling high-fidelity single-qubit
   gates
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW APPLIED
AB There have been impressive breakthroughs in semiconductor quantum dots in recent years, with singleand two-qubit gate fidelities matching other leading platforms and scalability still remaining a relative strength; however, due to qubit wiring considerations, mobile electron architectures have been proposed to facilitate upward scaling, and this opens the possibility of enlarging the motional amplitude for electricdipole spin resonance (EDSR)-based qubit manipulation. In this work, we examine and demonstrate the possibility of significantly outperforming static-EDSR-type single-qubit pulsing by taking advantage of greater spatial mobility to achieve higher Rabi frequencies and reduce the effect of charge noise. Our theoretical results indicate that fidelities are ultimately bottlenecked by spin-valley physics, which can be suppressed through the use of quantum optimal control. We demonstrate that, across different potential regimes and competing physical models, shuttling-based single-qubit gates retain significant advantages over existing alternatives.

AB Adaptive quantum circuits, which combine local unitary gates, midcircuit measurements, and feedforward operations, have recently emerged as a promising avenue for efficient state preparation, particularly on near-term quantum devices limited to shallow-depth circuits. Matrix product states (MPS) comprise a significant class of many-body entangled states, efficiently describing the ground states of one-dimensional gapped local Hamiltonians and finding applications in a number of recent quantum algorithms. Recently, it has been shown that the Affleck-Kennedy-Lieb-Tasaki state-a paradigmatic example of an MPS-can be exactly prepared with an adaptive quantum circuit of constant depth, an impossible feat with local unitary gates alone due to its nonzero correlation length [Smith et al., PRX Quantum 4, 020315 (2023)]. In this work, we broaden the scope of this approach and demonstrate that a diverse class of MPS can be exactly prepared using constant-depth adaptive quantum circuits, outperforming theoretically optimal preparation with unitary circuits. We show that this class includes short- and long-ranged entangled MPS, symmetryprotected topological (SPT) and symmetry-broken states, MPS with finite Abelian, non-Abelian, and continuous symmetries, resource states for MBQC, and families of states with tunable correlation length. Moreover, we illustrate the utility of our framework for designing constant-depth sampling protocols, such as for random MPS or for generating MPS in a particular SPT phase. We present sufficient conditions for particular MPS to be preparable in constant time, with global on-site symmetry playing a pivotal role. Altogether, this work demonstrates the immense promise of adaptive quantum circuits for efficiently preparing many-body entangled states and provides explicit algorithms that outperform known protocols to prepare an essential class of states.

TI Fluxonium: An Alternative Qubit Platform for High-Fidelity Operations
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB Superconducting qubits provide a promising path toward building large-scale quantum computers. The simple and robust transmon qubit has been the leading platform, achieving multiple milestones. However, fault-tolerant quantum computing calls for qubit operations at error rates significantly lower than those exhibited in the state of the art. Consequently, alternative superconducting qubits with better error protection have attracted increasing interest. Among them, fluxonium is a particularly promising candidate, featuring large anharmonicity and long coherence times. Here, we engineer a fluxonium-based quantum processor that integrates high qubit coherence, fast frequency tunability, and individual-qubit addressability for reset, readout, and gates. With simple and fast gate schemes, we achieve an average single-qubit gate fidelity of 99.97% and a two-qubit gate fidelity of up to 99.72%. This performance is comparable to the highest values reported in the literature of superconducting circuits. Thus our work, within the realm of superconducting qubits, reveals an alternative qubit platform that is competitive with the transmon system.

TI Quantum synchronization of a single trapped-ion qubit
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Synchronizing a few-level quantum system is of fundamental importance to the understanding of synchronization in the deep quantum regime. Whether a two-level system, the smallest quantum system, can be synchronized has been theoretically debated for the past several years. Here, for the first time, we demonstrate that a qubit can indeed be synchronized to an external driving signal by using a trapped-ion system. By engineering fully controllable gain and damping processes, an ion qubit is locked to the driving signal and oscillates in phase. Moreover, upon tuning the parameters of the driving signal, we observe characteristic features of the Arnold tongue as well. Our measurements agree remarkably well with numerical simulations based on recent theory on qubit synchronization. By synchronizing the basic unit of quantum information, our study opens up the possibility of exploring the application of quantum synchronization to quantum information processing in the near future.

TI Quantum walks in spaces with applied potentials
SO EUROPEAN PHYSICAL JOURNAL PLUS
AB Discrete quantum walks are a universal model of quantum computation equivalent to the quantum circuit model and can be mapped onto quantum circuits and executed using quantum computers. Quantum walks can model and simulate many physical systems and several quantum algorithms are based on them. Discrete quantum walks have been extensively studied, but quantum walks that evolve in spaces in which potentials are applied received little or no attention. Here, we formulate the discrete quantum walk model in one and two-dimensional spaces in which potentials are applied. In this formulation the quantum walker carries a "charge" affected by the potentials and the walk evolution is driven by both constant and time-varying potentials. We reproduce the tunneling through a barrier phenomenon and study the quantum walk evolution in one and two-dimensional spaces with various potential distributions. We demonstrate that our formulation can serve as a basis for applied quantum computing by studying maze running and the motion of vehicles in urban spaces. In these spaces curbs and buildings are modeled as impenetrable potential barriers and traffic lights as time-varying potential barriers. Quantum walks in spaces with applied potentials may open the way for the development of novel quantum algorithms in which inputs are introduced as potential profiles.

TI Fundamental Limit on the Power of Entanglement Assistance in Quantum
   Communication
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB The optimal rate of reliable communication over a quantum channel can be enhanced by preshared entanglement. Whereas the enhancement may be unbounded in infinite-dimensional settings even when the input power is constrained, a long-standing conjecture asserts that the ratio between the entanglement- assisted and unassisted classical capacities is bounded in finite-dimensional settings [Bennett et al., IEEE Trans. Inf. Theory 48 , 2637 (2002)]. In this Letter, we prove this conjecture by showing that their ratio is upper bounded by o(d2), where d is the input dimension of the channel. An application to quantum communication with noisy encoders and decoders is given.

TI Phase-Slip Based SQUID Used as a Photon Switch in Superconducting
   Quantum Computation Architectures
SO ELECTRONICS
AB The photon storage time in a superconducting coplanar waveguide (CPW) resonator is contingent on the loaded quality factor, primarily dictated by the input and output capacitance of the resonator. The phase-slip based superconducting quantum interference device (PS-SQUID) comprises two phase-slip (PS) junctions connected in series with a superconducting island in between. The PS-SQUID can manifest nonlinear capacitance behavior, with the capacitance finetuned by the gate voltage to minimize the impact of magnetic field noise as much as possible. By substituting the coupling capacitance of the CPW resonator with the PS-SQUID, the loaded quality factor of the resonator can be changed by three orders, thus, we get a microwave photon switch in superconducting quantum computation architectures. Furthermore, by regulating the loaded quality factors, the coupling strength between the CPW and superconducting quantum circuits can be controlled, enabling the ability to manipulate stationary qubits and flying qubits.

TI Scaling superconducting quantum chip with highly integratable quantum
   building blocks
SO SUPERCONDUCTOR SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY
AB Designing and fabricating large-scale superconducting quantum chips with increasing number of qubits is a pressing challenge for the quantum computing. Here, we propose a three-dimensional stacked chip architecture comprised with quantum building blocks. In which, two primary types of blocks are the qubit block and the coupling block. They are designed as functional parts that can be utilized within the same footprint across multiple levels of the chip stack in the vertical direction. Common technological problems, such as the sensitivity of capacitors and coupling strengths to fabrication parameters, and dielectric losses from interfaces, can be addressed at the intra-block or block level efficiently. Once a library of standard blocks is designed and verified, they can be selected and arranged into arrays on chips at the placing stage of the design flow for specific quantum applications. Such chip structure and design protocol will reduce the design difficulty, and promote the reuse of standard blocks, thus paving the way for chips for noisy intermediate-scale quantum computing and quantum error correction.

Continuous variable measurement-device-independent QKD (CV-MDI-QKD) can eliminate all the security threats arising from the receiver effectively, the crucial security loophole of CV-QKD implementations. Recently, CV-MDI-QKD has attracted extensive attention and witnessed rapid progress. Here, we review the achievements that have been made in the field of CV-MDI-QKD, including the basic principle, advancements in theoretical protocols, and experimental demonstrations. Finally, we discuss the challenges faced in practical applications and future research directions.

TI Free space continuous variable Quantum Key Distribution with discrete
   phases
SO PHYSICS OPEN
AB Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) offers unconditional security in principle. Many QKD protocols have been proposed and demonstrated to ensure secure communication between two authenticated users. Continuous variable (CV) QKD offers many advantages over discrete variable (DV) QKD since it is cost-effective, compatible with current classical communication technologies, efficient even in daylight, and gives a higher secure key rate. Keeping this in view, we demonstrate a discrete modulated CVQKD protocol in the free space which is robust against polarization drift. We also present the simulation results with a noise model to account for the channel noise and the effects of various parameter changes on the secure key rate. These simulation results help us to verify the experimental values obtained for the implemented CVQKD.

TI Cryogenic Embedded System to Support Quantum Computing: From 5-nm FinFET
   to Full Processor
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON QUANTUM ENGINEERING
AB Quantum computing can enable novel algorithms infeasible for classical computers. For example, new material synthesis and drug optimization could benefit if quantum computers offered more quantum bits (qubits). One obstacle for scaling up quantum computers is the connection between their cryogenic qubits at temperatures between a few millikelvin and a few kelvin (depending on qubit type) and the classical processing system on chip (SoC) at room temperature (300K). Through this connection, outside heat leaks to the qubits and can disrupt their state. Hence, moving the SoC into the cryogenic part eliminates this heat leakage. However, the cooling capacity is limited, requiring a low-power SoC, which, at the same time, has to classify qubit measurements under a tight time constraint. In this work, we explore for the first time if an off-the-shelf SoC is a plausible option for such a task. Our analysis starts with measurements of state-of-the-art 5-nm fin-shaped field-effect transistors (FinFETs) at 10 and 300 K. Then, we calibrate a transistor compact model and create two standard cell libraries, one for each temperature. We perform synthesis and physical layout of a RISC-V SoC at 300 K and analyze its performance at 10 K. Our simulations show that the SoC at 10 K is plausible but lacks the performance to process more than a few thousand qubits under the time constraint.

Here, we demonstrate that the entanglement can be also robust under effect of temperature within a wide range of parameters. It is shown, in particular, that the temperature dependence of entanglement often exhibits a nonmonotonic behavior. Namely, there turn out to be ranges of the model parame-ters, where entanglement is absent at zero temperature, but then, with an increase in temperature, it appears, passes through a maximum, and again vanishes.

TI Initial State Encoding via Reverse Quantum Annealing and H-Gain Features
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON QUANTUM ENGINEERING
AB Quantum annealing is a specialized type of quantum computation that aims to use quantum fluctuations in order to obtain global minimum solutions of combinatorial optimization problems. Programmable D-Wave quantum annealers are available as cloud computing resources, which allow users low-level access to quantum annealing control features. In this article, we are interested in improving the quality of the solutions returned by a quantum annealer by encoding an initial state into the annealing process. We explore two D-Wave features that allow one to encode such an initial state: the reverse annealing (RA) and the h-gain (HG) features. RA aims to refine a known solution following an anneal path starting with a classical state representing a good solution, going backward to a point where a transverse field is present, and then finishing the annealing process with a forward anneal. The HG feature allows one to put a time-dependent weighting scheme on linear (h) biases of the Hamiltonian, and we demonstrate that this feature likewise can be used to bias the annealing to start from an initial state. We also consider a hybrid method consisting of a backward phase resembling RA and a forward phase using the HG initial state encoding. Importantly, we investigate the idea of iteratively applying RA and HG to a problem, with the goal of monotonically improving on an initial state that is not optimal. The HG encoding technique is evaluated on a variety of input problems including the edge-weighted maximum cut problem and the vertex-weighted maximum clique problem, demonstrating that the HG technique is a viable alternative to RA for some problems. We also investigate how the iterative procedures perform for both RA and HG initial state encodings on random whole-chip spin glasses with the native hardware connectivity of the D-Wave Chimera and Pegasus chips.

TI Metasurface for complete measurement of polarization Bell state
SO NANOPHOTONICS
AB Bell state measurement is vital to quantum information technology. Conventional linear optical elements, however, cannot fully distinguish all polarization Bell states without assisting of additional degrees of freedom. Leveraging on a pair of binary-pixel metasurfaces, we demonstrate direct measurement of all four polarization Bell states. Each metasurface is designed to produce two output modes that linearly superpose three Bell states in the coincidence counting measurement. By rotating the polarizers, the coincidence counting measurement achieves a tunable anticorrelation between one and the other two Bell states, achieving Bell state detection efficiency of 75% in a single measurement. Complete and deterministic Bell state measurement is further realized by performing two measurements. Our work shows the advantage of utilization of metasurfaces in quantum detection schemes and is of great applicative interest for quantum dense coding, entanglement swapping, quantum teleportation protocols, and novel quantum information processing tasks.

TI Performance analysis of continuous-variable quantum key distribution
   using non-Gaussian states
SO QUANTUM INFORMATION PROCESSING
AB In this study, we analyse the efficiency of a protocol with discrete modulation of continuous variable non-Gaussian states, that is, the coherent states having the addition of one photon followed by the subtraction of one photon (PASCS). We calculate lower bounds of the asymptotic key rates against Gaussian collective attacks based on the fact that for sufficiently small modulation variances we remain close to the protocol with Gaussian modulation. We compare the results of a four-state protocol (quadrature phase-shift-keying) using PASCS with the ones using coherent states, and show that under the same environmental conditions, the former always outperforms the latter, allowing to increase the maximum possible distance for secret key generation. Interestingly, we find that for the protocol using discrete-modulated PASCS, the noisier the line, the better will be its performance compared to the protocol using coherent states, showing that continuous variable non-Gaussian states can be considerably more advantageous for performing quantum key distribution in non-ideal situations.

TI Calculation of the moscovium ground-state energy by quantum algorithms
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF QUANTUM CHEMISTRY
AB We investigate the possibility to calculate the ground-state energy of the atomic systems on a quantum computer. For this purpose we evaluate the lowest binding energy of the moscovium atom with the use of the iterative phase estimation and variational quantum eigensolver (VQE). The calculations by the VQE are performed with a disentangled unitary coupled cluster ansatz and with various types of hardware-efficient ansatze. The optimization is performed with the use of the Adam and quantum natural gradients procedures. The scalability of the ansatze and optimizers is tested by increasing the size of the basis set and the number of active electrons. The number of gates required for the iterative phase estimation and VQE is also estimated.

TI Qubit efficient entanglement spectroscopy using qubit resets
SO QUANTUM
AB One strategy to fit larger problems on NISQ devices is to exploit a tradeoff between circuit width and circuit depth. Unfortunately, this tradeoff still limits the size of tractable problems since the increased depth is often not realizable before noise dominates. Here, we develop qubit-efficient quantum algorithms for entanglement spectroscopy which avoid this tradeoff. In particular, we develop algorithms for computing the trace of the n-th power of the density operator of a quantum system, Tr(rho(n)), (related to the Renyi entropy of order n) that use fewer qubits than any previous efficient algorithm while achieving similar performance in the presence of noise, thus enabling spectroscopy of larger quantum systems on NISQ devices. Our algorithms, which require a number of qubits independent of n, are variants of previous algorithms with width proportional to n, an asymptotic difference. The crucial ingredient in these new algorithms is the ability to measure and reinitialize subsets of qubits in the course of the computation, allowing us to reuse qubits and increase the circuit depth without suffering the usual noisy consequences. We also introduce the notion of effective circuit depth as a generalization of standard circuit depth suitable for circuits with qubit resets. This tool helps explain the noise-resilience of our qubit-efficient algorithms and should aid in designing future algorithms. We perform numerical simulations to compare our algorithms to the original variants and show they perform similarly when subjected to noise. Additionally, we experimentally implement one of our qubit-efficient algorithms on the Honeywell System Model HO, estimating Tr(rho(n)) for larger a than possible with previous algorithms.

TI Sparse Reconstruction for Radar Imaging Based on Quantum Algorithms
SO IEEE GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
AB The sparse-driven radar imaging can obtain high-resolution images about a target scene with the down-sampled data. However, the huge computational complexity of the classical sparse recovery method for the particular situation seriously affects the practicality of the sparse imaging technology. In this letter, this is the first time the quantum algorithms are applied to the image recovery for the radar sparse imaging. First, the radar sparse imaging problem is analyzed and the calculation problem to be solved by quantum algorithms is determined. Then, the corresponding quantum circuit and its parameters are designed to ensure extremely low computational complexity, and the quantum-enhanced reconstruction algorithm for sparse imaging is proposed. Finally, the computational complexity of the proposed method is analyzed, and the simulation experiments with the raw radar data are illustrated to verify the validity of the proposed method.

TI Prelude to Simulations of Loop Quantum Gravity on Adiabatic Quantum
   Computers
SO FRONTIERS IN ASTRONOMY AND SPACE SCIENCES
AB The article addresses the possibility of implementing spin network states, used in the loop quantum gravity approach to Planck scale physics on an adiabatic quantum computer. The discussion focuses on applying currently available technologies and analyzes a concrete example of a D-Wave machine. It is introduced a class of simple spin network states which can be implemented on the Chimera graph architecture of the D-Wave quantum processor. However, extension beyond the currently available quantum processor topologies is required to simulate more sophisticated spin network states. This may inspire new generations of adiabatic quantum computers. A possibility of simulating loop quantum gravity is discussed, and a method of solving a graph non-changing scalar (Hamiltonian) constraint with the use of adiabatic quantum computations is proposed. The presented results establish a basis for the future simulations of Planck scale physics, specifically quantum cosmological configurations, on quantum annealers.

TI Fragment molecular orbital-based variational quantum eigensolver for
   quantum chemistry in the age of quantum computing
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB Quantum computers offer significant potential for complex system analysis, yet their application in large systems is hindered by limitations such as qubit availability and quantum hardware noise. While the variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) was proposed to address these issues, its scalability remains limited. Many efforts, including new ansatze and Hamiltonian modifications, have been made to overcome these challenges. In this work, we introduced the novel Fragment Molecular Orbital/Variational Quantum Eigensolver (FMO/VQE) algorithm. This method combines the fragment molecular orbital (FMO) approach with VQE and efficiently utilizes qubits for quantum chemistry simulations. Employing the UCCSD ansatz, the FMO/VQE achieved an absolute error of just 0.053 mHa with 8 qubits in a H24\documentclass[12pt]{minimal} \usepackage{amsmath} \usepackage{wasysym} \usepackage{amsfonts} \usepackage{amssymb} \usepackage{amsbsy} \usepackage{mathrsfs} \usepackage{upgreek} \setlength{\oddsidemargin}{-69pt} \begin{document}$${{\text{H}}}_{24}$$\end{document} system using the STO-3G basis set, and an error of 1.376 mHa with 16 qubits in a H20\documentclass[12pt]{minimal} \usepackage{amsmath} \usepackage{wasysym} \usepackage{amsfonts} \usepackage{amssymb} \usepackage{amsbsy} \usepackage{mathrsfs} \usepackage{upgreek} \setlength{\oddsidemargin}{-69pt} \begin{document}$${{\text{H}}}_{20}$$\end{document} system with the 6-31G basis set. These results indicated a significant advancement in scalability over conventional VQE, maintaining accuracy with fewer qubits. Therefore, our FMO/VQE method exemplifies how integrating fragment-based quantum chemistry with quantum algorithms can enhance scalability, facilitating more complex molecular simulations and aligning with quantum computing advancements.

AB Neutral atom arrays have recently emerged as a promising platform for fault-tolerant quantum computing. Based on these advances, including dynamically-reconfigurable connectivity and fast transversal operations, we present a low-overhead architecture that supports the layout and resource estimation of large-scale fault-tolerant quantum algorithms. Utilizing recent advances in fault tolerance with transversal gate operations, this architecture achieves a run time speed-up on the order of the code distance d, which we find directly translates to run time improvements of large-scale quantum algorithms.
   Our architecture consists of functional building blocks of key algorithmic subroutines, including magic state factories, quantum arithmetic units, and quantum look-up tables. These building blocks are implemented using efficient transversal operations, and we design space-time efficient versions of them that minimize interaction distance, thereby reducing atom move times and minimizing the volume for correlated decoding. We further propose models to estimate their logical error performance. We perform resource estimation for a large-scale implementation of Shor's factoring algorithm, one of the prototypical benchmarks for large-scale quantum algorithms, finding that 2048-bit RSA factoring can be executed with 19 million qubits in 5.6 days, for 1 ms QEC cycle times. This represents close to 50x speed-up of the run-time compared to existing estimates with similar assumptions, with no increase in space footprint.

TI Modular Quantum Processor with an All-to-All Reconfigurable Router
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW X
AB Superconducting qubits provide a promising approach to large-scale fault-tolerant quantum computing. However, qubit connectivity on a planar surface is typically restricted to only a few neighboring qubits. Achieving longer-range and more flexible connectivity, which is particularly appealing in light of recent developments in error-correcting codes, however, usually involves complex multilayer packaging and external cabling, which is resource intensive and can impose fidelity limitations. Here, we propose and realize a high-speed on-chip quantum processor that supports reconfigurable all-to-all coupling with a large on-off ratio. We implement the design in a four-node quantum processor, built with a modular design comprising a wiring substrate coupled to two separate qubit-bearing substrates, each including two singlequbit nodes. We use this device to demonstrate reconfigurable controlled-Z gates across all qubit pairs, with a benchmarked average fidelity of 96.00% + 0.08% and best fidelity of 97.14% + 0.07%, limited mainly by dephasing in the qubits. We also generate multiqubit entanglement, distributed across the separate modules, demonstrating GHZ-3 and GHZ-4 states with fidelities of 88.15%+0.24% and 75.18% + 0.11%, respectively. This approach promises efficient scaling to larger-scale quantum circuits and offers a pathway for implementing quantum algorithms and error-correction schemes that benefit from enhanced qubit connectivity.

TI Photosynthetic properties assisted by the quantum entanglement in two

SO EUROPEAN PHYSICAL JOURNAL PLUS
AB The quantum dynamics of entanglement is widely revealed in photosynthetic light-harvesting complexes. Different from the previous work, we explore the properties of exciton transport and photosynthesis assisted by the quantum entanglement in two adjacent pigment molecules, which are measured by the population dynamics behaviors, the j-V characteristics and by the output power via a photosynthetic quantum heat engine model. A more robust exciton transport dynamic behavior is compared with those without quantum entanglement, and the photosynthetic characteristics evaluated by the output current and power were proved to be enhanced by the quantum entanglement at different ambient temperatures. These results may point toward the possibility for artificial photosynthetic nanostructures inspired by this quantum biological systems.

TI Entropy, Fidelity, and Entanglement During Digitized Adiabatic Quantum
   Computing to Form a Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) State
SO ENTROPY
AB We analyzed the accuracy of digitized adiabatic quantum computing to form the entangled three-qubit Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) state on two IBM quantum computers and four quantum simulators by comparison with direct calculations using a Python code (version 3.12). We initialized three-qubit systems in the ground state of the Hamiltonian for noninteracting spins in an applied magnetic field in the x direction. We then gradually varied the Hamiltonian to an Ising model form with nearest-neighbor zz spin coupling with an eight-step discretization. The von Neumann entropy provides an indicator of the accuracy of the discretized adiabatic evolution. The von Neumann entropy of the density matrix from the Python code remains very close to zero, while the von Neumann entropy of the density matrices on the quantum computers increases almost linearly with the step number in the process. The GHZ witness operator indicates that the quantum simulators incorporate a GHZ component in part. The states on the two quantum computers acquire partial GHZ character, even though the trace of the product of the GHZ witness operator with the density matrix not only remains positive but also rises monotonically from Step 5 to Step 8. Each of the qubits becomes entangled during the adiabatic evolution in all of the calculations, as shown by the single-qubit reduced density matrices.

TI Halving the cost of quantum algorithms with randomization
SO NPJ QUANTUM INFORMATION
AB Quantum signal processing (QSP) provides a systematic framework for implementing a polynomial transformation of a linear operator, and unifies nearly all known quantum algorithms. In parallel, recent works have developed randomized compiling, a technique that promotes a unitary gate to a quantum channel and enables a quadratic suppression of error (i.e., & varepsilon; -> O(& varepsilon;2)) at little to no overhead. Here we integrate randomized compiling into QSP through Stochastic Quantum Signal Processing. Our algorithm implements a probabilistic mixture of polynomials, strategically chosen so that the average evolution converges to that of a target function, with an error quadratically smaller than that of an equivalent individual polynomial. Because nearly all QSP-based algorithms exhibit query complexities scaling as O(log(1/& varepsilon;))\documentclass[12pt]{minimal} \usepackage{amsmath} \usepackage{wasysym} \usepackage{amsfonts} \usepackage{amssymb} \usepackage{amsbsy} \usepackage{mathrsfs} \usepackage{upgreek} \setlength{\oddsidemargin}{-69pt} \begin{document}$$O(\log (1/\epsilon ))$$\end{document}-stemming from a result in functional analysis-this error suppression reduces their query complexity by a factor that asymptotically approaches 1/2. By the unifying capabilities of QSP, this reduction extends broadly to quantum algorithms, which we demonstrate on algorithms for real and imaginary time evolution, phase estimation, ground state preparation, and matrix inversion.

TI Quantum autoencoders for image classification
SO QUANTUM MACHINE INTELLIGENCE
AB Classical machine learning often struggles with complex, high-dimensional data. Quantum machine learning offers a potential solution, promising more efficient processing. The quantum convolutional neural network (QCNN), a hybrid algorithm, fits current noisy intermediate-scale quantum hardware. However, its training depends largely on classical computation. Future gate-based quantum computers may realize full quantum advantages. In contrast to QCNNs, quantum autoencoders (QAEs) leverage classical optimization solely for parameter tuning. Data compression and reconstruction are handled entirely within quantum circuits, enabling purely quantum-based feature extraction. This study introduces a novel image-classification approach using QAEs, achieving classification without requiring additional qubits compared with conventional QAE implementations. The quantum circuit structure significantly impacts classification accuracy. Unlike hybrid methods such as QCNN, QAE-based classification emphasizes quantum computation. Our experiments demonstrate high accuracy in a four-class classification task, evaluating various quantum-gate configurations to understand the impact of different parameterized quantum circuit (ansatz) structures on classification performance. An ideal situation in which quantum circuits yield perfect results is assumed, and a numerical simulator of quantum circuit measurements is used. Specifically, noise-free conditions are considered, and simulations are performed using a statevector simulator to model the quantum system with full amplitude precision. Our results reveal that specific ansatz structures achieve superior accuracy. Moreover, the proposed approach achieves performance comparable to that of conventional machine-learning methods while significantly reducing the number of parameters requiring optimization. These findings indicate that QAEs can serve as efficient classification models with fewer parameters and highlight the potential of utilizing quantum circuits for complete end-to-end learning.

TI Inverse Hamiltonian design of highly entangled quantum systems
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Solving inverse problems to identify Hamiltonians with desired properties holds promise for the discovery of fundamental principles. In quantum systems, quantum entanglement plays a pivotal role in not only characterizing the quantum nature but also developing quantum technology such as quantum computing. Nonetheless, the design principles of the quantum entanglement are yet to be clarified. Here we apply an inverse design framework using automatic differentiation to quantum spin systems, aiming to construct Hamiltonians with large quantum entanglement. We show that the method automatically finds the Kitaev model with bond-dependent anisotropic interactions, whose ground state is a quantum spin liquid, on both honeycomb and square-octagon lattices. On triangular and maple-leaf lattices with geometrical frustration, it generates numerous solutions with spatially inhomogeneous interactions rather than converging to a specific model, but it still helps to construct unprecedented models. The comparative study reveals that bond-dependent anisotropic interactions, rather than isotropic Heisenberg interactions, amplify quantum entanglement, even in the systems with geometrical frustration. The present study paves the way for the automatic design of new quantum systems with desired quantum nature and functionality.

TI Analysis of the FO Transformation in the Lattice-Based Post-Quantum
   Algorithms
SO MATHEMATICS
AB Newer variants of the Fujisaki-Okamoto transformation are used in most candidates of the third round of the NIST Post-Quantum Cryptography standardization call in the category of public key encryption schemes. These transformations are applied to obtain a highly secure key encapsulation mechanism from a less secure public key encryption scheme. Furthermore, there are five candidates (three finalists and two alternatives) that passed to the third round of the process and whose security is based in lattice problems. This work analyzes the different ways in which the lattice-based candidates of the NIST call apply the Fujisaki-Okamoto transformation and the particularities of each application. The study of such differences and their repercussion in the design of the proposals will allow a better understanding of the algorithms. Moreover, we propose a modification of the Kyber algorithm-the only public key encryption candidate established as a PQC standard by NIST in its more recent publication-in order to avoid the re-encryption in the decapsulation algorithm and, in this way, to reduce the side channel attacks vulnerability.

TI Precise Control of Entanglement in Multinuclear Spin Registers Coupled
   to Defects
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW X
AB May accepted published January Quantum networks play an indispensable role in quantum information tasks such as secure communications, enhanced quantum sensing, and distributed computing. Among the most mature and promising platforms for quantum networking are nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamond and other color centers in solids. One of the challenges in using these systems for networking applications is to controllably manipulate entanglement between the electron and the nuclear spin register despite the always-on nature of the hyperfine interactions, which makes this an inherently many-body quantum system. Here, we develop a general formalism to quantify and control the generation of entanglement in an arbitrarily large nuclear spin register coupled to a color center electronic spin. We provide a reliable measure of nuclear spin selectivity, by exactly incorporating into our treatment the dynamics with unwanted nuclei. We also show how to realize direct multipartite gates through the use of dynamical decoupling sequences, drastically reducing the total gate time compared to protocols based on sequential entanglement with individual nuclear spins. We quantify the performance of such gate operations in the presence of unwanted residual entanglement links, capturing the dynamics of the entire nuclear spin register. Finally, using experimental parameters of a well-characterized 27 nuclear spin register device, we show how to prepare with high-fidelity entangled states for quantum error correction. While in this analysis we focus on a particular NV-diamond-based register, our framework is completely general and applicable to other defects in diamond and in SiC.

AB Hong-Ou-Mandel (HOM) interference is the foundation of quantum optics to test the degree of indistinguishability of two incoming photons, playing a key role in quantum communication, sensing, and photonic quantum computing. Realizing high-visibility HOM interference with massively parallel optical channels is challenging due to the lack of available natural optical references for aligning independent arrayed laser pairs. Here, we demonstrate 50 parallel comb-teeth pairs of continuous-wave weak coherent photons HOM interference using two independently frequency post-aligned soliton microcombs (SMCs), achieving an average fringe visibility over 46%. The frequencies of all comb-teeth pairs are long-term aligned by developing two sets of fully frequency-stabilized SMCs with independent reference and adjusting free spectral range beyond 100 kilohertz through perturbations in soliton state. The verification experiment proves the feasibility of constructing massively quantum information channels by co-opting classical wavelength division multiplexing optical communications, which paves the way for practical large-scale quantum communication systems.

TI Reverse engineering of one-qubit filter functions with dynamical
   invariants
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB We derive an integral expression for the filter-transfer function of an arbitrary one-qubit gate through the use of dynamical invariant theory and Hamiltonian reverse engineering. We use this result to define a cost function which can be efficiently optimized to produce one-qubit control pulses that are robust against specified frequency bands of the noise power spectral density. We demonstrate the utility of our result by generating optimal control pulses that are designed to suppress broadband detuning and pulse amplitude noise. We report an order of magnitude improvement in gate fidelity in comparison with known composite pulse sequences. More broadly, we also use the same theoretical framework to prove the robustness of nonadiabatic geometric quantum gates under specific error models and control constraints.

TI Self-Correcting Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill Qubit and Gates in a
   Driven-Dissipative Circuit
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB We show that a self-correcting Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill (GKP) qubit can be realized with a highimpedance LC circuit coupled to a resistor and a Josephson junction via a controllable switch. When activating the switch in a particular stepwise pattern, the resonator relaxes into a subspace of GKP states that encode a protected qubit. Under continued operation, the resistor dissipatively error corrects the qubit against bit flips and decoherence by absorbing noise-induced entropy. We show that this leads to an exponential enhancement of the coherence time (T1 and T2), even in the presence of extrinsic noise, imperfect control, and device-parameter variations. We show that the qubit supports exponentially robust singlequbit Clifford gates, implemented via appropriate control of the switch, and readout and/or initialization via supercurrent measurement. The self-correcting properties of the qubit allow it to operate at approximately 1-K temperatures and resonator Q factors down to approximately 1000 for realistic parameters, and make it amenable to parallel control through global control signals. We discuss how the effects of quasiparticle poisoning-potentially, though not necessarily, a limiting factor-might be mitigated. We finally demonstrate that a related device supports a self-correcting magic T gate.

AB CNOT optimization plays a significant role in noise reduction for Quantum Circuits. Several heuristic and exact approaches exist for CNOT optimization. In this paper, we investigate more complicated variations of optimal synthesis by allowing qubit permutations and handling layout restrictions. We encode such problems into Planning, SAT, and QBF. We provide optimization for both CNOT gate count and circuit depth. For experimental evaluation, we consider standard T-gate optimized benchmarks and optimize CNOT sub-circuits. We show that allowing qubit permutations can further reduce up to 56% in CNOT count and 46% in circuit depth. In the case of optimally mapped circuits under layout restrictions, we observe a reduction up to 17% CNOT count and 19% CNOT depth.

AB Quantum computing has revolutionized the field of computer science with its extraordinary ability to handle classically intractable problems. To realize its potential, however, quantum computers need to scale to millions of qubits, a feat that will require addressing fascinating yet extremely challenging interconnection problems. In this paper, we provide a context analysis of the nascent quantum computing field from the perspective of communications, with the aim of encouraging the on-chip networks community to contribute and pave the way for truly scalable quantum computers in the decades to come.

TI Improved spectral gaps for random quantum circuits: Large local
   dimensions and all-to-all interactions
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Random quantum circuits are a central concept in quantum information theory with applications ranging from demonstrations of quantum computational advantage to descriptions of scrambling in strongly interacting systems and black holes. The utility of random quantum circuits in these settings stems from their ability to rapidly generate quantum pseudorandomness. In a seminal paper by Brandao, Harrow, and Horodecki [Commun. Math. Phys. 346, 397 (2016)] it was proven that the tth moment operator of local random quantum circuits on n qudits with local dimension q has a spectral gap of at least Omega(n(-1) t(-5-3.1/ln(q))) which implies that they are efficient constructions of approximate unitary designs. As a first result, we use Knabe bounds for the spectral gaps of frustration-free Hamiltonians to show that one-dimensional random quantum circuits have a spectral gap scaling as Omega(n(-1)), provided that t is small compared to the local dimension: t(2 )<= O(q). This implies a (nearly) linear scaling of the circuit depth in the design order t. Our second result is an unconditional spectral gap bounded below by Omega[n(-1) ln(-1) (n)t(-alpha)((q))] for random quantum circuits with all-to-all interactions. This improves both the n and t scaling in design depth for the nonlocal model. We show this by proving a recursion relation for the spectral gaps involving an auxiliary random walk. Lastly, we solve the smallest nontrivial case exactly and combine with numerics and Knabe bounds to improve the constants involved in the spectral gap for small values of t.

TI Qubernetes: Towards a unified cloud-native execution platform for hybrid
   classic-quantum computing
SO INFORMATION AND SOFTWARE TECHNOLOGY
AB Context: The emergence of quantum computing proposes a revolutionary paradigm that can radically transform numerous scientific and industrial application domains. The ability of quantum computers to scale computations beyond what the current computers are capable of implies better performance and efficiency for certain algorithmic tasks. Objective: However, to benefit from such improvement, quantum computers must be integrated with existing software systems, a process that is not straightforward. In this paper, we propose a unified execution model that addresses the challenges that emerge from building hybrid classical-quantum applications at scale. Method: Following the Design Science Research methodology, we proposed a convention for mapping quantum resources and artifacts to Kubernetes concepts. Then, in an experimental Kubernetes cluster, we conducted experiments for scheduling and executing quantum tasks on both quantum simulators and hardware. Results: The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed platform Qubernetes (or Kubernetes for quantum) exposes the quantum computation tasks and hardware capabilities following established cloud-native principles, allowing seamless integration into the larger Kubernetes ecosystem. Conclusion: The quantum computing potential cannot be realized without seamless integration into classical computing. By validating that it is practical to execute quantum tasks in a Kubernetes infrastructure, we pave the way for leveraging the existing Kubernetes ecosystem as an enabler for hybrid classical-quantum computing.

TI Quantum storage of 1650 modes of single photons at telecom wavelength
SO NPJ QUANTUM INFORMATION
AB To advance the full potential of quantum networks one should be able to distribute quantum resources over long distances at appreciable rates. As a consequence, all components in such networks need to have large multimode capacity to manipulate photonic quantum states. Towards this end, a photonic quantum memory with a large multimode capacity, especially one operating at telecom wavelength, remains an important challenge. Here we optimize the preparation of atomic frequency combs and demonstrate a spectro-temporally multiplexed quantum memory in a 10-m-long cryogenically cooled erbium doped silica fibre. Our multiplexing storage has five spectral channels - each 10 GHz wide with 5 GHz separation - with up to 330 temporal modes in each, thus resulting in a simultaneous storage of 1,650 modes of heralded single photons with a 1000-fold increasing in coincidence detection rate with respect to single mode storage. Our results could pave the way for high speed quantum networks compatible with the infrastructure of fibre optical communication.

TI Numerical analysis of quantum circuits for state preparation and unitary
   operator synthesis
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB We perform optimal-control-theory calculations to determine the minimum number of two-qubit controlled -not (CNOT) gates needed to perform quantum state preparation and unitary operator synthesis for few-qubit systems. By considering all possible gate configurations, we determine the maximum achievable fidelity as a function of quantum circuit size. This information allows us to identify the minimum circuit size needed for a specific target operation and enumerate the different gate configurations that allow a perfect implementation of the operation. We find that there are a large number of configurations that all produce the desired result, even at the minimum number of gates. We also show that the number of entangling gates can be reduced if we use multiqubit entangling gates instead of two-qubit CNOT gates, as one might expect based on parameter counting calculations. In addition to treating the general case of arbitrary target states or unitary operators, we apply the numerical approach to the special case of synthesizing the multiqubit Toffoli gate. This approach can be used to investigate any other specific few-qubit task and provides insight into the tightness of different bounds in the literature.

TI Quantum Key Distribution with Post-Processing Driven by Physical
   Unclonable Functions
SO APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL
AB Quantum key distribution protocols allow two honest distant parties to establish a common truly random secret key in the presence of powerful adversaries, provided that the two users share a short secret key beforehand. This pre-shared secret key is used mainly for authentication purposes in the post-processing of classical data that have been obtained during the quantum communication stage, and it prevents a man-in-the-middle attack. The necessity of a pre-shared key is usually considered to be the main drawback of quantum key distribution protocols, and it becomes even stronger for large networks involving more than two users. Here, we discuss the conditions under which physical unclonable functions can be integrated in currently available quantum key distribution systems in order to facilitate the generation and the distribution of the necessary pre-shared key with the smallest possible cost in the security of the systems. Moreover, the integration of physical unclonable functions in quantum key distribution networks allows for real-time authentication of the devices that are connected to the network.

SO QUANTUM SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB Entanglement-based quantum key distribution can enable secure communication in trusted node-free networks and over long distances. Although implementations exist both in fiber and in free space, the latter approach is often considered challenging due to environmental factors. Here, we implement a quantum communication protocol during daytime for the first time using a quantum dot source. This technology presents advantages in terms of narrower spectral bandwidth-beneficial for filtering out sunlight-and negligible multiphoton emission at peak brightness. We demonstrate continuous operation over the course of three days, across an urban 270 m-long free-space optical link, under different light and weather conditions.

TI Fiber-Integrated van der Waals Quantum Sensor with an Optimal Cavity
   Interface
SO ADVANCED OPTICAL MATERIALS
AB Integrating quantum materials with fiber optics adds advanced functionalities to a variety of applications, and introduces fiber-based quantum devices such as remote sensors capable of probing multiple physical parameters. However, achieving optimal integration between quantum materials and fibers is challenging, particularly due to difficulties in fabrication of quantum elements with suitable dimensions and an efficient photonic interface to a commercial optical fiber. Here a new modality for a fiber-integrated van der Waals quantum sensor is demonstrated. A hole-based circular Bragg grating cavity from hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) is designed and fabricated, engineer optically active spin defects within the cavity, and integrate the cavity with an optical fiber using a deterministic pattern transfer technique. The fiber-integrated hBN cavity enables efficient excitation and collection of optical signals from spin defects in hBN, thereby enabling all-fiber integrated quantum sensors. Moreover, remote sensing of a ferromagnetic material and of arbitrary magnetic fields is demonstrated. All in all, the hybrid fiber-based quantum sensing platform may pave the way to a new generation of robust, remote, multi-functional quantum sensors.
   A novel modality for fiber-integrated van der Waals quantum sensors paves the way for significant innovations and new possibilities. This work demonstrates a hexagonal boron nitride circular Bragg grating cavity for remote, room temperature quantum sensing with spin defects, utilizing only the fiber itself and eliminating the need for bulky optics or cryogenics. image

We use quantum circuits that can be modelled as Fourier series approximation of the desired function to encode the solution of a differential equation. We resort to parameter shift rules to compute the exact derivatives of this quantum circuit and hence to define a physics loss. Further we enforce the boundary conditions of our differential equations in the loss function of the QPINN to obtain a unique solution to the given differential equation. We present our preliminary results for two instances of 1D Poisson equation.

SO QUANTUM INFORMATION PROCESSING
AB Quantum catalytic transformations play important roles in the transformation of quantum entangled states under local operations and classical communications (LOCC). The key problems in catalytic transformations are the existence and the bounds on the catalytic states. We present the necessary conditions of catalytic states based on a set of points given by the Schmidt coefficients of the entangled source and target states. The lower bounds on the dimensions of the catalytic states are also investigated. Moreover, we give a detailed protocol of quantum mixed state transformation under entanglement-assisted LOCC.

TI Efficient Boolean Methods for Preparing Uniform Quantum States
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON QUANTUM ENGINEERING
AB As each quantum algorithm requires a specific initial quantum state, quantum state preparation is an important task in quantum computing. The preparation of quantum states is performed by a quantum circuit consisting of controlled-NOT (CNOT) and single-qubit gates. Known algorithms to prepare arbitrary n-qubit quantum states create quantum circuits in O(2(n)) runtime and use O(2(n)) CNOTs, which are more expensive than single-qubit gates in NISQ architectures. To reduce runtime and the number of CNOTs, we simplify the problem by considering an important family of quantum states, which are uniform quantum states (UQSs). We map UQSs to Boolean functions and propose a UQS preparation (UQSP) method. Preparing UQSs using Boolean functions allows us to utilize different representations of Boolean functions. We utilize decision diagrams to reduce runtime and enable preparation for a larger number of qubits where the state-of-the-art methods are not applicable. To further reduce the number of CNOTs, we utilize variable reordering and functional dependencies among the variables. Our state preparation method requires an exponential number of CNOTs in theworst case but it reduces CNOTs significantly for practical benchmarks. Moreover, our method generates an exact representation of quantum states without using free-qubits. We compare our algorithm with QisKit. The comparison shows that our UQSP method is capable to reduce the average number of CNOTs by 75.31% for the practical benchmarks. The runtime is almost reduced by a factor of 2.

TI Interpreting Quantum Entanglement: Steps towards Coherentist Quantum
   Mechanics
SO BRITISH JOURNAL FOR THE PHILOSOPHY OF SCIENCE
AB We put forward a new, 'coherentist' account of quantum entanglement, according to which entangled systems are characterized by symmetric relations of ontological dependence among the component particles. We compare this coherentist viewpoint with the two most popular alternatives currently on offer-structuralism and holism-and argue that it is essentially different from, and preferable to, both. In the course of this article, we point out how coherentism might be extended beyond the case of entanglement and further articulated.

TI Quantum computing hardware in the cloud: Should a computational chemist
   care?
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF QUANTUM CHEMISTRY
AB Within the last decade much progress has been made in the experimental realization of quantum computing hardware based on a variety of physical systems. Rapid progress has been fuelled by the conviction that sufficiently powerful quantum machines will herald enormous computational advantages in many fields, including chemical research. A quantum computer capable of simulating the electronic structures of complex molecules would be a game changer for the design of new drugs and materials. Given the potential implications of this technology, there is a need within the chemistry community to keep abreast with the latest developments as well as becoming involved in experimentation with quantum prototypes. To facilitate this, here we review the types of quantum computing hardware that have been made available to the public through cloud services. We focus on three architectures, namely superconductors, trapped ions and semiconductors. For each one we summarize the basic physical operations, requirements and performance. We discuss to what extent each system has been used for molecular chemistry problems and highlight the most pressing hardware issues to be solved for a chemistry-relevant quantum advantage to eventually emerge.

AB Many hacking incidents are linked to work files because most companies work with them. However, a variety of file encryption and decryption methods have been proposed. Existing file encryption/decryption technologies are under threat as hacking technologies advance, necessitating the development of stronger encryption algorithms. Therefore, in this study, we propose a modified advanced encryption standard (AES) algorithm and use quantum computing to encrypt/decrypt AES image files. Because the shift is regular during the AES Shift Row procedure, the change technique led the shift to become irregular when using quantum random walk. Computing resources and speeds were simulated using IBM Qiskit quantum simulators for performance evaluation, whereas encryption performance was assessed using number of pixels change rate (NPCR) and unified average changing intensity (UACI).

TI Efficient and Low-Backaction Quantum Measurement Using a Chip-Scale
   Detector
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB Superconducting qubits are a leading platform for scalable quantum computing and quantum error correction. One feature of this platform is the ability to perform projective measurements orders of magnitude more quickly than qubit decoherence times. Such measurements are enabled by the use of quantum-limited parametric amplifiers in conjunction with ferrite circulators-magnetic devices which provide isolation from noise and decoherence due to amplifier backaction. Because these nonreciprocal elements have limited performance and are not easily integrated on chip, it has been a long-standing goal to replace them with a scalable alternative. Here, we demonstrate a solution to this problem by using a superconducting switch to control the coupling between a qubit and amplifier. Doing so, we measure a transmon qubit using a single, chip-scale device to provide both parametric amplification and isolation from the bulk of amplifier backaction. This measurement is also fast, high fidelity, and has 70% efficiency, comparable to the best that has been reported in any superconducting qubit measurement. As such, this work constitutes a high-quality platform for the scalable measurement of superconducting qubits.

TI Microwave-to-optical transduction with erbium ions coupled to planar
   photonic and superconducting resonators
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Optical quantum networks can connect distant quantum processors to enable secure quantum communication and distributed quantum computing. Superconducting qubits are a leading technology for quantum information processing but cannot couple to long-distance optical networks without an efficient, coherent, and low noise interface between microwave and optical photons. Here, we demonstrate a microwave-to-optical transducer using an ensemble of erbium ions that is simultaneously coupled to a superconducting microwave resonator and a nanophotonic optical resonator. The coherent atomic transitions of the ions mediate the frequency conversion from microwave photons to optical photons and using photon counting we observed device conversion efficiency approaching 10(-7). With pulsed operation at a low duty cycle, the device maintained a spin temperature below 100 mK and microwave resonator heating of less than 0.15 quanta.
   Interfacing superconducting quantum information processors with long-distance optical networks would require coherent interfacing between microwave and optical photons. Here, the authors show a chip-integrated microwave-to-optical transducer based on rare earth ion ensembles.

TI Bespoke pulse design for robust rapid two-qubit gates with trapped ions
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Two-qubit gate performance is vital for scaling up ion-trap quantum computing. Optimized quantum control is needed to achieve reductions in gate duration and gate error rate. We describe two-qubit gates with addressed Raman beams within a linear trapped-ion chain by a quantum master equation (QME). The QME incorporates the single-ion two-photon effective Rabi frequency, Autler-Townes and vibrational Bloch-Siegert energy shifts, off-resonant transitions, Raman and Rayleigh scattering, laser-power fluctuations, motional heating, cross-Kerr phonon coupling, laser spillover, asymmetric addressing beams, and an imperfect initial motional ground state, with no fitting parameters, whereas state-of-the-art methods are oblivious to these effects in the gate design procedure. We employ global optimization to design pulse sequences for achieving a robust rapid two-qubit gate for a simulated chain of seven trapped 171Yb+ ions by optimizing over numerically integrated QME solutions. Here, robust means resilient against slow drift of motional frequencies, and rapid means gate execution where the effective Rabi frequency is comparable to the detuning of the laser from the ion's bare electronic transition. Our robust quantum control delivers rapid high-quality two-qubit gates in long ion chains, enabling scalable quantum computing with trapped ions.

TI Improving gradient methods via coordinate transformations: Applications
   to quantum machine learning
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB In this paper, we introduce a generic strategy to accelerate and improve the overall performance of machinelearning algorithms, both in their classical and quantum versions, heavily rely on optimization algorithms based on gradients, such as gradient descent. The overall performance is dependent on the appearance of local minima and barren plateaus, which slow down calculations and lead to nonoptimal solutions. In practice, this results in dramatic computational and energy costs for artificial intelligence applications. Our method is based on coordinate transformations, like variational rotations, adding extra directions in parameter space that depend on the cost function itself, and which allowus to explore the configuration landscape more efficiently. The validity of our method is benchmarked by boosting several quantum machine-learning algorithms, getting a very significant improvement in their performance.

TI Error-Robust Quantum Logic Optimization Using a Cloud Quantum Computer
   Interface
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW APPLIED
AB We describe an experimental effort designing and deploying error-robust single-qubit operations using a cloud-based quantum computer and analog-layer programming access. We design numerically optimized pulses that implement target operations and exhibit robustness to various error processes including dephasing noise, instabilities in control amplitudes, and crosstalk. Pulse optimization is performed using a flexible optimization package incorporating a device model and physically relevant constraints (e.g., bandwidth limits on the transmission lines of the dilution refrigerator housing IBM Quantum hardware). We present techniques for conversion and calibration of physical Hamiltonian definitions to pulse waveforms programmed via Qiskit Pulse and compare performance against hardware default derivative removal by adiabatic gate (DRAG) pulses on a five-qubit device. Experimental measurements reveal default DRAG pulses exhibit coherent errors an order of magnitude larger than tabulated randomized-benchmarking measurements; solutions designed to be robust against these errors outperform hardware-default pulses for all qubits across multiple metrics. Experimental measurements demonstrate performance enhancements up to: about a 10 times single-qubit gate coherent-error reduction; about a 5 times average coherent-error reduction across a five-qubit system; about a 10 times increase in calibration window to one week of valid pulse calibration; about a 12 times reduction gate-error variability across qubits and over time; and up to about a 9 times reduction in single-qubit gate error (including crosstalk) in the presence of fully parallelized operations. Randomized benchmarking reveals error rates for Clifford gates constructed from optimized pulses consistent with tabulated T-1 limits, and demonstrates a narrowing of the distribution of outcomes over randomizations associated with suppression of coherent errors.

AB We propose a scheme for universal quantum computing based on Kramers rare-earth ions. Their nuclear spins in the presence of a Zeeman-split electronic crystal field ground state act as "passive" qubits that store quantum information. The "active" qubits are switched on optically by fast coherent transitions to excited crystal field states with a magnetic moment, and the magnetic dipole interaction between these states is used to implement controlled NOT (CNOT) gates. We compare our proposal with others, noting particularly the much improved CNOT gate time as compared with a Si:P proposal, also relying on magnetic dipole interactions between active qubits, and rare-earth schemes depending on the dipole blockade for qubits spaced by more than of the order of 1 nm.

TI Quantum computing enhanced knowledge tracing: Personalized KT research
   for mitigating data sparsity
SO JOURNAL OF KING SAUD UNIVERSITY COMPUTER AND INFORMATION SCIENCES
AB With the development of artificial intelligence in education, knowledge tracing (KT) has become a current research hotspot and is the key to the success of personalized instruction. However, data sparsity remains a significant challenge in the KT domain. To address this challenge, this paper applies quantum computing (QC) technology to KT for the first time. It proposes two personalized KT models incorporating quantum mechanics (QM): quantum convolutional enhanced knowledge tracing (QCE-KT) and quantum variational enhanced knowledge tracing (QVE-KT). Through quantum superposition and entanglement properties, QCE-KT and QVE-KT effectively alleviate the data sparsity problem in the KT domain through quantum convolutional layers and variational quantum circuits, respectively, and significantly improve the quality of the representation and prediction accuracy of students' knowledge states. Experiments on three datasets show that our models outperform ten benchmark models. On the most sparse dataset, QCE-KT and QVE-KT improve their performance by 16.44% and 14.78%, respectively, compared to DKT. Although QC is still in the developmental stage, this study reveals the great potential of QM in personalized KT, which provides new perspectives for solving personalized instruction problems and opens up new directions for applying QC in education.

TI Bright Tripartite Quantum Steering Generated by Above-Threshold Optical
   Parametric Oscillation
SO ADVANCED QUANTUM TECHNOLOGIES
AB Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR) steering is the key resources in quantum information processing. EPR steering light sources typically obtained through spontaneous parametric down conversion below a threshold are relatively weak. Strong bright EPR steering light source can be obtained by operating the resonant cavity above the threshold. Here, the quantum steering correlations of the system above the threshold are analyzed using numerical simulations based on the quantum random trajectory method in Wigner representation. By employing the genuine multipartite EPR steering criterion, it is demonstrated that genuine bright tripartite EPR steering can be generated above the threshold, and investigate the influences of the nonlinear parameters on the genuine tripartite EPR steering. The scheme of bright EPR steering light source generated by cascaded nonlinear process can be used as a quantum repeater in quantum communication.
   This work presents a scheme to generate genuine bright tripartite EPR steering by spontaneous parametric down-conversion cascaded with a sum-frequency process within an above-threshold optical cavity. Using the Wigner representation and quantum random locus method, genuine bright tripartite EPR steering among signal, idle, and sum-frequency beams can be achieved in a wide range above the threshold. image

TI Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill qubit synthesizer for propagating light
SO NPJ QUANTUM INFORMATION
AB Practical quantum computing requires robust encoding of logical qubits in physical systems to protect fragile quantum information. Currently, the lack of scalability limits the logical encoding in most physical systems, and thus the high scalability of propagating light can be a game changer. However, propagating light also has difficulty in logical encoding due to weak nonlinearity. Here, we propose a synthesizer that encodes Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill (GKP) qubits in propagating light by exploiting the nonlinearity of photon detectors. This synthesizer is based on an approach what we call Gaussian breeding, leading to the following four advantages: (i) systematic and rigorous synthesis of arbitrary GKP qubits, (ii) use of minimal resources, (iii) high fidelity and high success probability, and (iv) robustness against loss. There has been no protocol that incorporates all these advantages, and thus the proposed synthesizer excels in both performance and feasibility. By employing our method, one can generate GKP qubits using a few to several squeezed light sources, beam splitters and photon detectors.

TI Device-Independent Quantum Key Distribution Based on Routed Bell Tests
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB Photon losses are the main obstacle to fully photonic implementations of device-independent quantum key distribution (DIQKD). Motivated by recent work showing that routed Bell scenarios offer increased robustness to detection inefficiencies for the certification of long-range quantum correlations, we investigate DIQKD protocols based on a routed setup. In these protocols, in some of the test rounds, photons from the source are routed by an actively controlled switch to a nearby test device instead of the distant one. We show how to analyze the security of these protocols and compute lower bounds on the key rates using noncommutative polynomial optimization and the Brown-Fawzi-Fawzi method. We determine lower bounds on the asymptotic key rates of several simple two-qubit routed DIQKD protocols based on CHSH or BB84 correlations and compare their performance to standard protocols. For high-quality short-path tests, we find that routed DIQKD protocols are significantly more robust to losses, showing an improvement of approximately 30% in the detection efficiency compared to their nonrouted counterparts. This translates to a large improvement in the distance over which nonzero key can be distilled in optical setups with near-perfect single-photon detectors, where the main source of loss in the setup is due to transmission in the fiber. Notably, the routed BB84 protocol achieves a positive key rate with a detection efficiency as low as 50% for the distant device, the minimal threshold for any QKD protocol featuring two untrusted measurements. However, the advantages we find are highly sensitive to noise and losses affecting the short-range correlations involving the additional test device.

TI Hardware-efficient variational quantum algorithms for time evolution
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Parameterized quantum circuits are a promising technology for achieving a quantum advantage. An important application is the variational simulation of time evolution of quantum systems. To make the most of quantum hardware, variational algorithms need to be as hardware-efficient as possible. Here we present alternatives to the time-dependent variational principle that are hardware-efficient and do not require matrix inversion. In relation to imaginary time evolution, our approach significantly reduces the hardware requirements. With regards to real time evolution, where high precision can be important, we present algorithms of systematically increasing accuracy and hardware requirements. We numerically analyze the performance of our algorithms using quantum Hamiltonians with local interactions.

TI Statistical limits for entanglement swapping with semiconductor
   entangled photon sources
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
AB Semiconductor quantum dots are promising building blocks for quantum communication applications. Although deterministic, efficient, and coherent emission of entangled photons has been realized, implementing a practical quantum repeater remains outstanding. Here we explore the statistical limits for entanglement swapping with sources of polarization-entangled photons from the commonly used biexciton-exciton cascade. We stress the necessity of tuning the exciton fine structure, and explain why the often observed time evolution of photonic entanglement in quantum dots is not applicable for large quantum networks. We identify the critical, statistically distributed device parameters for entanglement swapping based on two sources. A numerical model for benchmarking the consequences of device fabrication, dynamic tuning techniques, and statistical effects is developed, in order to bring the realization of semiconductor-based quantum networks one step closer to reality.

SO QUANTUM SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB The second quantum revolution is all about exploiting the quantum nature of atoms and molecules to execute quantum information processing tasks. To boost this growing endeavor and by anticipating the key role of quantum chemistry therein, our work establishes a framework for systematically exploring, quantifying and dissecting correlation effects in molecules. By utilizing the geometric picture of quantum states we compare-on a unified basis and in an operationally meaningful way-total, quantum and classical correlation and entanglement in molecular ground states. To unlock and maximize the quantum informational resourcefulness of molecules an orbital optimization scheme is developed, leading to a paradigm-shifting insight: a single covalent bond equates to the entanglement 2ln(2)

TI Frequency-domain engineering of bright squeezed vacuum for
   continuous-variable quantum information
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB Multimode bright squeezed vacuum is a non-classical state of light hosting a macroscopic photon number while offering promising capacity for encoding quantum information in its spectral degree of freedom. Here, we employ an accurate model for parametric down -conversion in the high-gain regime and use nonlinear holography to design quantum correlations of bright squeezed vacuum in the frequency domain. We propose the design of quantum correlations over two-dimensional lattice geometries that are all-optically controlled, paving the way toward continuous-variable cluster state generation on an ultrafast timescale. Specifically, we investigate the generation of a square cluster state in the frequency domain and calculate its covariance matrix and the quantum nullifier uncertainties, that exhibit squeezing below the vacuum noise level. & COPY; 2023 Optica Publishing Group under the terms of the Optica Open Access Publishing Agreement

TI Evaluating dynamic spectrum allocation using quantum annealing
SO IEICE COMMUNICATIONS EXPRESS
AB Dynamic spectrum allocation (DSA) between different radio systems is a promising method to efficiently use limited frequency resources. The approach of DSA is to allow different mobile network operators to use the same shared channel, without causing interference across base stations. However, existing methods to solve DSA are computationally very expensive. In this paper, we formulate the DSA problem for quantum annealing. Our evaluation demonstrates that momentum annealing as a high performance classical method of quantum annealing can obtain high accuracy solutions of the DSA problem in short time.

The accuracy is below 10-3 comparing to maximal possible value of the witness in higher dimension. The test involving minimal independent sets of preparation and measurement operations (gates) is applied both for specific configurations and parametric ones. The test is robust against nonidealities such as incoherent leakage and erroneous gate execution.

TI Phonon-induced decoherence in color-center qubits
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Electron spin states of solid-state defects such as nitrogen-and silicon-vacancy color centers in diamond are a leading quantum-memory candidate for quantum communications and computing. Via open-quantum -systems modeling of spin-phonon coupling-the major contributor of decoherence-at a given temperature, we derive the time dynamics of the density operator of an electron-spin qubit. We use our model to corroborate experimentally measured decoherence rates. We further derive the temporal decay of distillable entanglement in spin-spin entangled states heralded via photonic Bell-state measurements. Extensions of our model to include other decoherence mechanisms, e.g., undesired hyperfine couplings to the neighboring nuclear-spin environ-ment, will pave the way to a rigorous predictive model for engineering artificial-atom qubits with desirable properties.

TI A FULL DICHOTOMY FOR Holantc, INSPIRED BY QUANTUM COMPUTATION
SO SIAM JOURNAL ON COMPUTING
AB Holant problems are a family of counting problems parameterized by sets of algebraic-complex-valued constraint functions and defined on graphs. They arise from the theory of holographic algorithms, which was originally inspired by concepts from quantum computation. Here, we employ quantum information theory to explain existing results about holant problems in a concise way and to derive two new dichotomies: one for a new family of problems, which we call Holant(+), and, building on this, a full dichotomy for Holant(c). These two families of holant problems assume the availability of certain unary constraint functions the two pinning functions in the case of Holant(c), and four functions in the case of Holant(+)-and allow arbitrary sets of algebraic-complex valued constraint functions otherwise. The dichotomy for Holant(+) also applies when inputs are restricted to instances defined on planar graphs. In proving these complexity classifications, we derive an original result about entangled quantum states.

TI Performance comparison of Gilbert's algorithm and machine learning in
   classifying Bell-diagonal two-qutrit entanglement
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB While classifying states as entangled or separable is one of the fundamental tasks in quantum information theory, it is also extremely challenging. This task is highly nontrivial even for relatively simple cases, such as two-qutrit Bell-diagonal states, i.e., mixtures of nine mutually orthogonal maximally entangled states. In this article we apply Gilbert's algorithm to revise previously obtained results for this class. In particular we use "entanglement cartography" to argue that most states left in [Hiesmayr, B. C. Scientific Reports 11, 19739 (2021)] as unknown to be entangled or separable are most likely indeed separable, or very weakly entangled, beyond any practical relevance. The presented technique can find endless applications in more general cases.

TI Two-dimensional quantum walks of correlated photons
SO OPTICA
AB Quantum walks in an elaborately designed graph are a powerful tool for simulating physical and topological phenomena, constructing novel quantum algorithms, and realizing universal quantum computing. Integrated photonics technology has emerged as a versatile platform for implementing a variety of quantum information tasks and as a promising candidate for performing large-scale quantum walks. Both extending physical dimensions and involving more particles will increase the complexity of the evolving systems. Pioneering studies have demonstrated a single particle walking on two-dimensional lattices and multiple walkers interfering on a one-dimensional structure. However, multiple particles evolving in a genuine two-dimensional space in a scalable fashion has remained a vacancy for nearly 10 years. We present a genuine two-dimensional quantum walk with correlated photons on a triangular photonic lattice, which is mapped to a 37 x 37 high-dimensional state space. The genuine two-dimensional quantum walk breaks through the physical restrictions of single-particle evolution, allowing for the encoding of information in large spaces and construction of high-dimensional graphs, which are beneficial for quantum information processing. Between the chip and the two-dimensional fanout interface, site-by-site addressing enables simultaneous detection of over 600 nonclassical interferences and observation of quantum correlations that violate a classical limit by 57 standard deviations. Our implementation provides a paradigm for multi-photon quantum walks in a two-dimensional configuration on a large scale, paving the way for practical quantum simulation and computation beyond the classical regime.

TI Design of mid-infrared entangled photon sources using lithium niobate

AB The mid-infrared (MIR) band entangled photon source is vital for the next generation of quantum communication, quantum imaging, and quantum sensing. However, the current entangled states are mainly prepared in the visible or near-infrared bands. It is still lacking high-quality entangled photon sources in the MIR band. In this work, we optimize the poling sequence of lithium niobate to prepare two kinds of typical entangled states, the Hermit- Gaussian state and the comb-like entangled state at 3.2 mu m. We have also calculated the photon pair rates and estimated the effect of fabrication resolution in the schemes. Our approach will provide entangled photon sources with excellent performance for the study of quantum information in the MIR band.(c) 2022 Optica Publishing Group

TI Scanning qubit probe of edge states in a topological insulator
SO PHYSICS LETTERS A
AB In this work, we propose a novel qubit-based sensor with the ability to characterize topological edge states in low-dimensional systems. A composite system is studied, consisting of a qubit coupled to a topologically nontrivial Su-Schrieffer-Heeger chain between semi-infinite lead channels. This qubit probe utilizes decoherence dynamics which, under a weak-coupling framework, are related to the environment's local density of states. Qubit decoherence rate measurements along a sample therefore provide the means to extract edge state profiles. The environment's influence on the qubit's subspace is captured by an effective projective treatment, leading to an analytical decoherence rate expression. We demonstrate that the scanning qubit probe identifies and yields a complete spatial characterization of the topological edge states within the composite system.(c) 2023 Elsevier B.V.

TI Entanglement and Charge-Sharpening Transitions in U(1) Symmetric
   Monitored Quantum Circuits
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW X
AB Monitored quantum circuits can exhibit an entanglement transition as a function of the rate of measurements, stemming from the competition between scrambling unitary dynamics and disentangling projective measurements. We study how entanglement dynamics in nonunitary quantum circuits can be enriched in the presence of charge conservation, using a combination of exact numerics and a mapping onto a statistical mechanics model of constrained hard-core random walkers. We uncover a charge-sharpening transition that separates different scrambling phases with volume-law scaling of entanglement, distinguished by whether measurements can efficiently reveal the total charge of the system. We find that while Renyi entropies grow sub-ballistically as root t in the absence of measurement, for even an infinitesimal rate of measurements, all average Renyi entropies grow ballistically with time similar to t. We study numerically the critical behavior of the charge-sharpening and entanglement transitions in U(1) circuits, and show that they exhibit emergent Lorentz invariance and can also be diagnosed using scalable local ancilla probes. Our statistical mechanical mapping technique readily generalizes to arbitrary Abelian groups, and offers a general framework for studying dissipatively stabilized symmetry-breaking and topological orders.

TI Counterfactual quantum key distribution with untrusted detectors
SO HELIYON
AB Compared with the traditional BB84 protocol, the counterfactual quantum key distribution (QKD) does not rely on any signal travelling in the quantum channel, and therefore can present a security advantage where Eve cannot fully access signal. However, the practical system may be damaged in a scenario where the devices are untrusted. In this paper, we analyze the security of counterfactual QKD in untrusted detectors scenario. We show that the requirement to disclose "which detector clicked" has become the main loophole in all counterfactual QKD versions. An eavesdropping scheme which is similar to the memory attack on device-independent QKD could break its security by exploiting detectors' imperfections. We consider two different counterfactual QKD protocols and analyze their security against this major loophole. One is a modified Noh09 protocol, which would be secure in untrusted detectors context. Another is a variant of counterfactual QKD with high efficiency (Phys. Rev. A 104 (2021) 022424) against a series of detectors side-channel attacks as well as against other attacks that exploit detectors imperfections.

TI Two-level quantum walkers on directed graphs. I. Universal quantum
   computing
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB In the present paper, the first in a series of two, we propose a model of universal quantum computation using a fermionic or bosonic multiparticle continuous-time quantum walk with two internal states (e.g., the spin-up and-down states of an electron). A dual-rail encoding is adopted to convert information: A single qubit is represented by the presence of a single quantum walker in either of the two parallel paths. We develop a roundabout gate that moves a walker from one path to the next, either clockwise or counterclockwise, depending on its internal state. It can be realized by a single-particle scattering on a directed weighted graph with the edge weights 1 and +/- i. The roundabout gate also allows the spatial information of the quantum walker to be temporarily encoded in its internal states. The universal gates are constructed by appropriately combining several roundabout gates, some unitary gates that act on the internal states, and two-particle scatterings on straight paths. No ancilla qubits are required in our model. The computation is done by just passing quantum walkers through properly designed paths. Namely, there is no need for any time-dependent control.

TI Surpassing the repeaterless bound with a photon-number encoded
   measurement-device-independent quantum key distribution protocol
SO NPJ QUANTUM INFORMATION
AB Decoherence is detrimental to quantum key distribution (QKD) over large distances. One of the proposed solutions is to use quantum repeaters, which divide the total distance between the users into smaller segments to minimise the effects of the losses in the channel. Here we introduce a measurement-device-independent protocol which uses high-dimensional states prepared by two distant trusted parties and a coherent total photon number detection for the entanglement swapping measurement at the repeater station. We present an experimentally feasible protocol that can be implemented with current technology as the required states reduce down to the single-photon level over large distances. This protocol outperforms the existing measurement-device-independent and twin-field QKD protocols by achieving better key rates in general and higher transmission distance in total when experimental imperfections are considered. It also surpasses the fundamental limit of the repeaterless bound at a much shorter transmission distance in comparison to the existing TF-QKD protocols.

TI Randomness-free detection of non-projective measurements: qubits &
   beyond
SO NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB Non-projective measurements play a crucial role in various information-processing protocols. In this work, we propose an operational task to identify measurements that are neither projective nor classical post-processing of data obtained from projective measurements. Our setup involves space-like separated parties with access to a shared state with bounded local dimensions. Specifically, in the case of qubits, we focus on a bipartite scenario with different sets of target correlations. While some of these correlations can be obtained through non-projective measurements on a shared two-qubit state, it is impossible to generate these correlations using projective simulable measurements on bipartite qubit states, or equivalently, by using one bit of shared randomness and local post-processing. For certain target correlations, we show that detecting qubit non-projective measurements is robust under arbitrary depolarizing noise, except in the limiting case. We extend this task for qutrits and demonstrate that some correlations achievable via local non-projective measurements cannot be reproduced by both parties performing the same qutrit projective simulable measurements on their pre-shared state. We provide numerical evidence for the robustness of this scheme under arbitrary depolarizing noise. For a more generic consideration (bipartite and tripartite scenario), we provide numerical evidence for a projective-simulable bound on the reward function for our task. We also show a violation of this bound by using qutrit positive operator valued measures. From a foundational perspective, we extend the notion of non-projective measurements to general probabilistic theories (GPTs) and use a randomness-free test to demonstrate that a class of GPTs, called square-bits or box-world are unphysical.

TI Classical simulation of quantum circuits using a multiqubit Bloch vector
   representation of density matrices
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB In the Bloch sphere picture, one finds the coefficients for expanding a single-qubit density operator in terms of the identity and Pauli matrices. A generalization to n qubits via tensor products represents a density operator by a real vector of length 4n, conceptually similar to a state vector. Here, we study this approach for the purpose of quantum circuit simulation, including noise processes. The tensor structure leads to computationally efficient algorithms for applying circuit gates and performing few-qubit quantum operations. In view of variational circuit optimization, we study "backpropagation" through a quantum circuit and gradient computation based on this representation, and generalize our analysis to the Lindblad equation for modeling the (nonunitary) time evolution of a density operator.

TI Rodeo Algorithm for Quantum Computing
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB We present a stochastic quantum computing algorithm that can prepare any eigenvector of a quantum Hamiltonian within a selected energy interval [E - epsilon, E + epsilon) . In order to reduce the spectral weight of all other eigenvectors by a suppression factor d, the required computational effort scales as O[vertical bar log delta vertical bar/(p epsilon)], where p is the squared overlap of the initial state with the target eigenvector. The method, which we call the rodeo algorithm, uses auxiliary qubits to control the time evolution of the Hamiltonian minus some tunable parameter E. With each auxiliary qubit measurement, the amplitudes of the eigenvectors are multiplied by a stochastic factor that depends on the proximity of their energy to E. In this manner, we converge to the target eigenvector with exponential accuracy in the number of measurements. In addition to preparing eigenvectors, the method can also compute the full spectrum of the Hamiltonian. We illustrate the performance with several examples. For energy eigenvalue determination with error epsilon, the computational scaling is O[(log epsilon)(2)/(p epsilon)]. For eigenstate preparation, the computational scaling is O(log Delta/p), where. is the magnitude of the orthogonal component of the residual vector. The speed for eigenstate preparation is exponentially faster than that for phase estimation or adiabatic evolution.

AB High-level synthesis is a mature Electronics Design Automation (EDA) technology for building hardware design in a short time. It produces automatically HDL code for FPGAs out of C/C++, bridging the gap from algorithm to hardware. Nevertheless, sometimes the QoR (Quality of Results) can be sub-optimal due to the difficulties of HLS in handling general-purpose software code. In this paper, we explore the current difficulties of HLS while synthesizing Lattice-based Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC) algorithms. We propose code-level optimizations to overcome the limitations of high-level synthesis increasing the QoR of generated hardware. We analyzed and improved the results for the algorithms competing in the 3rd round of the NIST standardization process. We show how, starting from the original reference code submitted for the competition, original performance and resource utilization can be improved, in some cases with a speedup factor up to 200 x or an area reduction of 80%.

TI Wide-angle spectral filter for energy-saving windows designed by quantum
   annealing-enhanced active learning
SO CELL REPORTS PHYSICAL SCIENCE
AB Multi -band spectral filters that can transmit visible light but block UV and infrared light in the solar spectrum are applicable to energy -saving windows. However, such filters are usually designed to consider normal incident light only. Here, we report photonic structures allowing selective solar spectrum transmission in wide angles using a quantum -computing -enhanced active learning scheme, which includes machine learning, quantum annealing, and wave -optics simulation in an iterative loop. We experimentally demonstrate the optical characteristics of the photonic structure and its capability to reduce the temperature rise in an enclosure when combined with a thermal radiation layer (temperature reduction of 5.4 degrees C- 7.2 degrees C and annual energy saving of X97.5 MJ/m 2 ). This structure can be incorporated into existing windows in buildings or automobiles to reduce cooling energy consumption, and the active learning scheme can be applied to design materials with complex properties in general.

TI Multiplexing Quantum and Classical Channels of a Quantum Key
   Distribution (QKD) System by Using the Attenuation Method
SO PHOTONICS
AB The primary goal in this paper is to verify the possibility of combining a quantum channel into a single optical fiber with other classical channels by using the so-called attenuation method. Since the quantum channel is very weak in terms of power, combining it into a single fiber with much more powerful classical channels is challenging. Thus, sufficiently high-quality filtering is important to avoid possible crosstalk. A second and more difficult problem to address is the interference caused by Raman noise, which increases with the fiber length and is also dependent on the input power of the classical channel. Thus, in this paper the focus is on the possibility of suppressing the Raman noise effect, both in advance by means of wavelength positioning and by means of installed optical components. Such phenomena must be considered in the route design, as the quantum channel must be placed at a suitable wavelength with respect to the classical channels. The influence of other nonlinear phenomena has been neglected. In this paper, a practical experiment aimed at building a fully functional multiplexed quantum key distribution link is also described.

TI Quantum Error Detection in Qubit-Resonator Star Architecture
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB Achieving industrial quantum advantage is unlikely without the use of quantum error correction (QEC). Other QEC codes beyond surface code are being experimentally studied, such as color codes and quantum low-density parity check codes, that could benefit from new quantum processing unit (QPU) architectures. We introduce the six-qubit star lattice architecture that offers parallelism and effective local all-to-all connectivity and thus enables hardware-efficient implementation of certain QEC codes. As a first demonstration of this new architecture, we encode two logical qubits in a six-qubit superconducting QPU with a star topology using the [[4, 2, 2] code and characterize the logical states with the classical shadow framework. Logical lifetime and logical error rate are measured over repeated quantum error detection cycles for various logical states including a logical Bell state. We measure logical state fidelities above 96% for every cardinal logical state, find logical lifetimes above the best physical element, and logical error-percycle values ranging from 0.25(2)% to 0.91(3)%. In future, such star units can be tiled into a lattice to enable QEC codes with high-weight and overlapping stabilizers for improved encoding rates.

TI Single-Copy Certification of Two-Qubit Gates Without Entanglement
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW APPLIED
AB A quantum state transformation can be generally approximated by single-and two-qubit gates. This, however, does not hold with noisy intermediate-scale quantum technologies due to the errors appearing in the gate operations, where errors of two-qubit gates such as controlled-NOT and SWAP operations are dominated. In this work we present a cost efficient single-copy certification for a realization of a two-qubit gate in the presence of depolarization noise, where we aim to identify if the realization is noise free, or not. We show that entangled resources such as entangled states and a joint measurement are not necessary for the purpose, i.e., a noise-free two-qubit gate is not needed to certify an implementation of a two-qubit gate. We present a proof-of-principle demonstration with photonic qubits.

AB Quantum computers are expected to scale in size to close the gap that currently exists between quantum algorithms and quantum hardware. To this end, quantum compilation techniques must scale along with the hardware constraints, shifting the current paradigm of obtaining an optimal compilation to relying on heuristics that allow for a fast solution, even though the quality of such a solution may not be optimal. Significant concerns arise as the execution time of current mapping techniques experiences a notable increase when applied to quantum computers with a high number of qubits. In this work, we present Route-Forcing, a quantum circuit mapping algorithm that shows a compilation time average speedup of 3.7x compared to the state-of-the-art scalable techniques, reducing the depth of the mapped circuit by 4.7x at the expense of adding 1.3x more SWAP gates. Moreover, the proposed mapping algorithm is adapted and tuned for what is expected to be the next generation of quantum computers, in which different processors are interconnected to increase the total number of qubits, allowing for more complex computations.

It is analytically shown that all reduced purities grow in the process of deterministic measurements. This allows us to characterize the stability of bi-partite entanglement during the optimal correlation transfer under single-qubit measurements in the asymptotic limit N >> 1.

AB Isogeny-based cryptography has emerged as a strong candidate for post-quantum security due to the believed hardness of finding isogenies between supersingular elliptic curves. However, an ongoing challenge is the efficient computation of isogenies in practical cryptographic protocols such as SIDH or SIKE. In this work, we present new algorithmic optimizations for isogeny computation, notably by leveraging Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) techniques for polynomial arithmetic and by exploiting endomorphisms inherent to supersingular curves. We provide detailed mathematical derivations, analyze theoretical complexities, and validate the performance gains through experimental results. Our findings indicate a substantial efficiency improvement, making isogeny-based systems more feasible for real-world post-quantum applications.

By controlling the capacitance or inductance of resonators, it is possible to control the phase of the voltage arbitrarily. A set of resonators acts as the phase-shift, the Hadamard, and the CNOT gates. They constitute a set of universal quantum gates. We also discuss an application to an artificial neuron. As an example, we study pattern recognition of numbers and alphabets by evaluating the similarity between an input and the reference pattern. We also study colored pattern recognition by using a complex neural network.

TI Efficient noise mitigation technique for quantum computing
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB Quantum computers have enabled solving problems beyond the current machines' capabilities. However, this requires handling noise arising from unwanted interactions in these systems. Several protocols have been proposed to address efficient and accurate quantum noise profiling and mitigation. In this work, we propose a novel protocol that efficiently estimates the average output of a noisy quantum device to be used for quantum noise mitigation. The multi-qubit system average behavior is approximated as a special form of a Pauli Channel where Clifford gates are used to estimate the average output for circuits of different depths. The characterized Pauli channel error rates, and state preparation and measurement errors are then used to construct the outputs for different depths thereby eliminating the need for large simulations and enabling efficient mitigation. We demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed protocol on four IBM Q 5-qubit quantum devices. Our method demonstrates improved accuracy with efficient noise characterization. We report up to 88% and 69% improvement for the proposed approach compared to the unmitigated, and pure measurement error mitigation approaches, respectively.

TI Variational approach to photonic quantum circuits via the parameter
   shift rule
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB In the era of noisy intermediate-scale quantum computers, variational quantum algorithms are promising approaches for solving optimization tasks by training parameterized quantum circuits with the aid of classical routines informed by quantum measurements. In this context, photonic platforms based on reconfigurable integrated optics are an ideal candidate for implementing these algorithms. Among various techniques to train variational circuits, the parameter shift rule enables the exact calculation of cost function derivatives efficiently, facilitating gradient descent-based optimization. In this paper, we derive a formulation of the parameter shift rule for computing derivatives and integrals tailored to reconfigurable optical linear circuits and based on the Boson Sampling paradigm. This allows us to naturally embed common types of experimental noise, such as partial distinguishability and mixedness of the states, thus obtaining a resilient approach. Finally, we employ the developed approach to experimentally test variational algorithms with single-photon states processed in a reconfigurable six-mode universal integrated interferometer. Specifically, we apply the photonic parameter shift rules to the variational implementation, on a photonic platform, of both an eigensolver and a Universal-NOT gate.

TI RETRACTED: Method for Quantum Denoisers Using Convolutional Neural
   Network (Retracted Article)
SO COMPUTATIONAL INTELLIGENCE AND NEUROSCIENCE
AB In many applications of quantum information science, high-dimensional entanglement is needed. Quantum teleportation is used for transferring information from one place to another using Einstein-Podolsk-Rosen pairs (EPR) and two classical bits of communication in a channel. Since we cannot produce multiple copies of an unknown state for amplification, we will generate multiple EPR pairs. However, after the distribution of the EPR pairs, they will have decreased fidelity with the ideal EPR state. So, to maintain the quantum states and maximize the quantification of the entanglement without losing the strength of the states, we propose to denoise the channel for a few types of noise. We created a random noise source and filtered out the irrelevant information without affecting the relevant information encoded in the quantum states. The proposed model is used for successful denoising of GHZ states from spin flips and bit flip errors. Much of the research work is not carried out by using machine-language-based neural networks for noise-reduction in quantum channels. In this paper, we propose a denoiser called quantum denoiser CNQD, which uses a feedforward convolution neural network model. We tuned our model with highly entangled GHZ states with zero phases and phase between [0, Pi] mixed with different kinds of noise. Finally, the proposed model can be used for optimal quantum communication via noisy quantum channels using GHZ states.

TI Linear multi-photon storage based on dark modes with frequency tuning
SO NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB We propose a quantum memory applicable to the optical regime based on a linear system. The system is in a symmetrical star configuration: one central mode is both connected to the input-output channel and uniformly coupled to a number of modes with tunable frequencies. We show that, as long as the number of these tunable modes is double an odd number, such a configuration is just flexible enough to perform the storage and on-demand recall of a number of individual photons. Tuning of the mode frequencies is feasible experimentally by means of adiabatic frequency tuning, and we show the system is scalable and robust against various type of imperfections. Moreover, the linearity of the system is compatible with the use of single-mode continuous-variable error correction code. Our results therefore provide a promising approach to the storage of many photons carrying protected quantum information.

TI EQDSC: Embedded Quantum Density-Based Spatial Clustering for Community
   Detection
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB Identifying community structures in complex networks is foundational to graph theory, but classical algorithms struggle with scalability and the "curse of dimensionality" in high-dimensional embedding, while existing quantum methods lack unified architectures or compatibility with practical hardware. Here we present Embedded Quantum Density-based Spatial Clustering (EQDSC), an end-to-end quantum framework for community detection with key theoretical and technical advances over state-of-the-art approaches: it integrates discrete-time quantum walks (DTQW) augmented with Grover diffusion operators for efficient topological feature extraction, and adopts quantum fidelity to quantify similarity-mitigating dimensionality issues inherently. We validated EQDSC on 11 real-world and synthetic datasets via Qiskit simulations. It achieved up to 0.855 modularity and 0.887 NMI (DBLP), outperforming classical methods by 18-35% on large networks. The achieved gains stem from quantum superposition and accelerated quantum walk diffusion, with small-dataset performance restricted by constrained parameter optimization. Simulated performance confirms practical applicability, laying the groundwork for future deployment on real NISQ devices.

TI Continuous variable quantum teleportation of a thermal state in a
   thermal environment
SO RESULTS IN PHYSICS
AB The analytical formula for the fidelity of teleportation from Alice to Bob of a thermal state used as an input state is derived using the characteristic function approach. As a resource state it is used a continuous-variable two-mode bosonic state shared between Alice and Bob and the system is placed in a contact with a general environment. The quantum fidelity depends on the average thermal photon number of the input sate and on the parameters of the resource state and environment. In order to evaluate the parameters required for a successful quantum teleportation of a thermal state we estimate the evolution of the entanglement and fidelity of teleportation in the case when Alice and Bob share an initial squeezed thermal state in contact with a thermal bath. We work in the framework of the theory of open quantum systems based on completely positive dynamical semigroups and we use the Gorini-Kossakowski-Lindblad-Sudarshan master equation in order to describe the evolution of the system. The conditions for a successful quantum teleportation are the fidelity of teleportation larger than the threshold value of the classical fidelity of teleportation and entanglement present in the resource state. In order to assure the fulfillment of these conditions it is necessary to select the time of teleportation and to adjust the parameters characterizing the system (squeezing between the modes of the resource state, their average numbers of thermal photons and frequencies), and the temperature of the thermal reservoir. It is shown that in similar physical conditions, the fidelity of teleportation of the thermal states is larger than that one for a coherent state.

TI Entanglement islands, fire walls and state paradox from quantum
   teleportation and entanglement swapping
SO CLASSICAL AND QUANTUM GRAVITY
AB Recent discovery of the fine-grained entropy formula in gravity succeeded in reconstructing the Page curves that are compatible with unitary evolution. The formula of generalized entropy derived from the gravitational path integration, nevertheless, does not provide a concrete insight on how information comes out from a black hole. In this paper, we start from a qubit model and provide a quantum informational interpretation of entanglement islands. We propose an identification of entanglement islands with quantum measurements and remark on the parallel between the black hole information problem and the old problem of quantum measurements. We show that the Page curve can still be realized even if information is lost so that the information paradox can be explained as one manifestation of measurement problem. We show that such interpretation is necessary for a quantum informational model if smooth horizons and bulk reconstruction are assumed, and demonstrate explicitly that Page curves of solvable 2D gravity can be obtained through teleportation and entanglement swapping. We argue that the similarities between the black hole information problem and the measurement problem suggest links in the origins of the two problems.

TI Analysis of Quantum Machine Learning Algorithms in Noisy Channels for
   Classification Tasks in the IoT Extreme Environment
SO IEEE INTERNET OF THINGS JOURNAL
AB By 2050, there will be a 50% rise in energy demand,and existing natural and renewable resources will be under extreme scrutiny. Optimizing current power generation and transmission to reduce energy consumption, cost, and other factors is equally vital to upgrading methods for effectively har-vesting renewable energy. However, it gets more challenging for conventional computers to perform optimization as the number of factors affecting power generation and transmission rises.Extreme environmental cases will consequently lead to the imper-fect functioning of Internet of Things (IoT) systems. By utilizing quantum-mechanical properties, such as superposition and entan-glement, quantum computers can computationally out perform classical computers while consuming much less energy. In thisarticle, we investigate various quantum machine learning algo-rithms on two data sets (TWTDUS and SDWTT18) related toIoT extreme environment and study the effect of a noisy quan-tum environment. We observe that for the TWTDUS data set, thevariational UU dagger with analytical clustering methods achieves thehighest accuracy of 98.10%. Similarly, for the SDWTT18 data set,theUU dagger method withk-means clustering achieves an accuracyof 94.43%. The results show that the accuracy of the proposedquantum algorithms outperforms the existing classical methodsand can be utilized to forecast output power generation daily bymeasuring the metrics required in energy sector decision-makingsituations. This will be useful to save energy and costs in an IoT-extreme environment, where energy organizations must decideinstantly whether to start or stop generating units.

TI Quantum Enabled Data Authentication Without Classical Control
   Interaction
SO ELECTRONICS
AB We present a quantum-assisted data authentication protocol that integrates classical information-theoretic security with quantum communication techniques. We assume only that the participants have access to open classical and quantum channels, and share a random static key material. Building on the Wegman-Carter paradigm, our scheme employs universal hashing for message authentication and leverages quantum channels to securely transmit random nonces, eliminating the need for key recycling. The protocol utilizes polar codes within Wyner's wiretap channel model to ensure confidentiality and reliability, even in the presence of an all-powerful adversary. Security analysis demonstrates that the protocol inherits strong guarantees from both classical and quantum frameworks, provided the quantum channel maintains low loss and noise.

TI Vector optomechanical entanglement
SO NANOPHOTONICS
AB The polarizations of optical fields, besides field intensities, provide more degrees of freedom to manipulate coherent light-matter interactions. Here, we propose how to achieve a coherent switch of optomechanical entanglement in a polarized-light-driven cavity system. We show that by tuning the polarizations of the driving field, the effective optomechanical coupling can be well controlled and, as a result, quantum entanglement between the mechanical oscillator and the optical transverse electric mode can be coherently and reversibly switched to that between the same phonon mode and the optical transverse magnetic mode. This ability to switch optomechanical entanglement with such a vectorial device can be important for building a quantum network being capable of efficient quantum information interchanges between processing nodes and flying photons.

TI Optomechanical entanglement manipulation and switching in a
   squeezed-cavity-assisted optomechanical system
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB Quantum entanglement is pivotal in modern quantum technologies, spanning applications from quantum networks to quantum metrology. Controllable quantum entanglement in cavity optomechanical systems has been an enduring pursuit. We propose a unique method for flexible manipulation and switching of optomechanical entanglement in a squeezed-cavity-assisted optomechanical system consisting of a chi(2)-nonlinear optical cavity and an optomechanical cavity. Squeezing the nonlinear optical cavity through parametric pumping allows effective control of light-light and light-vibration interactions within the system. This capability of the squeezed system plays a key role in manipulating quantum entanglement. We find that quantum entanglement between the unsqueezed cavity mode and the mechanical mode can be effectively regulated by adjusting the pump laser parameters. Furthermore, by turning the phase of the pump, we can achieve highly flexible quantum switching between entanglement and separability. Additionally, we demonstrate increased entanglement between the squeezed cavity mode and the mechanical mode when completely suppressing the pump-induced optical input noise. Our findings pave the way not only towards the manipulation and protection of fragile quantum entanglement but also to achieve photon-phonon quantum control by exploiting quantum squeezing.

SO PHYSICS LETTERS A
AB We consider quantum graph states that can be mapped to directed weighted graphs, also known as directed networks. The geometric measure of entanglement of the states is calculated for the quantum graph states corresponding to arbitrary graphs. We find relationships between the entanglement and the properties of the corresponding graphs. Namely, we obtain that the geometric measure of entanglement of a qubit with other qubits in the graph state is related to the weights of ingoing and outgoing arcs with respect to the vertex representing the qubit, outdegree and indegree of the corresponding vertex in the graph. For unweighted and undirected graphs, the entanglement depends on the degree of the corresponding vertex. Quantum protocol for quantifying of the entanglement of the quantum graph states is constructed. As an example, a quantum graph state corresponding to a chain is examined, and the entanglement of the state is calculated on AerSimulator.

SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
AB Structure in quantum entanglement entropy is often leveraged to focus on a small corner of the exponentially large Hilbert space and efficiently parametrize the problem of finding ground states. A typical example is the use of matrix product states for local and gapped Hamiltonians. We study the structure of entanglement entropy using persistent homology, a relatively new method from the field of topological data analysis. The inverse quantum mutual information between pairs of sites is used as a distance metric to form a filtered simplicial complex. Both ground states and excited states of common spin models are analyzed as an example. Furthermore, the effect of homology with different coefficients and boundary conditions is also explored. Beyond these basic examples, we also discuss the promising future applications of this modern computational approach, including its connection to the question of how space-time could emerge from entanglement.

TI Metalloporphyrins as Building Blocks for Quantum Information Science
SO ADVANCED OPTICAL MATERIALS
AB The intrinsic quantum nature of molecules opens exciting opportunities for developing the field of quantum information science. In this context, porphyrins stand out as ideal building blocks for quantum technologies thanks to their unique optical and electrical properties as well as their capacity to accommodate metal atoms and ions. This review bridges the chemistry and physics of porphyrins, providing an overview of recent advances in porphyrin-based molecular qubits. Starting from qubits, the review explores the potential of porphyrin units to combine, leading to the formation of quantum logic gates and hierarchical higher-dimensional structures. Next, the exploitation of porphyrins' unique photophysical properties for realizing long-lived high spin states is examined. These states are promising for the photogeneration of multi-level systems and the optical initialization and control of molecular qubits. With a critical eye on the current state-of-the-art, the review elucidates the future perspectives of porphyrins for advancing quantum technologies.
   Porphyrins represent ideal building blocks for quantum information science. Their ability to accommodate metal ions makes them an excellent platform for quantum bits. Their distinctive molecular structure enables the formation of quantum logic gates and higher-dimensional systems. Their molecular stability makes them highly suitable for surface processing. Lastly, their unique optical properties hold promise for photoinduced applications. image

TI Security Models and Cryptographic Protocols in a Quantum World
SO FOUNDATIONS AND TRENDS IN THEORETICAL COMPUTER SCIENCE
AB The emergence of quantum computing has provided new paradigms for cryptography. On the one hand, it poses significant new threats to existing classically cryptographic systems, requiring the community to define new security models that capture what a quantum adversary can do. On the other hand, it gives us new tools to design cryptographic protocols, with weaker assumptions than in the classical world, or even protocols that are impossible classically. In this survey, we first give an overview of new security definitions for classical cryptography, considering quantum adversaries who can either only use local quantum computation (post-quantum security), or even send quantum messages and in particular have access to oracle in superposition (quantum security). We explore these new notions through the examples of commitments, zero-knowledge proofs, encryption, and signatures. Then, we present what is arguably the most famous application of quantum cryptography: quantum key distribution (QKD) protocols that take advantage of unique properties of quantum mechanics to provide secure communication unconditionally. We also explore cryptography beyond QKD, focusing on unclonable cryptography: a family of cryptographic functionalities, built with quantum states, and designed to be resistant to counterfeit by leveraging the "no-cloning" theorem. We examine in particular quantum money, but also the recent notions of unclonable encryption and copy-protection, including related variants. By presenting a comprehensive survey of these topics, this paper aims to provide a thorough understanding of the current landscape and future potential of quantum cryptography.

TI Resource-Efficient Context-Aware Dynamical Decoupling Embedding for
   Arbitrary Large-Scale Quantum Algorithms
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB We introduce and implement GraphDD: an efficient method for real-time, circuit-specific, optimal embedding of dynamical decoupling (DD) into executable quantum algorithms. We demonstrate that for an arbitrary quantum circuit, GraphDD exactly refocuses both quasistatic single-qubit dephasing and crosstalk idling errors over the entire circuit, while using a minimal number of additional single-qubit gates embedded into idle periods. The method relies on a graph representation of the embedding problem, where the optimal decoupling sequence can be efficiently calculated using an algebraic computation that scales linearly with the number of idles. This allows optimal DD to be embedded during circuit compilation, without any calibration overhead, additional circuit execution, or numerical optimization. The method is generic and applicable to any arbitrary circuit; in compiler runtime the specific pulse-sequence solutions are tailored to the individual circuit, and consider a range of contextual information on circuit structure and device connectivity. We verify the ability of GraphDD to deliver enhanced circuit-level error suppression on 127-qubit IBM devices, showing that the optimal circuit-specific DD embedding resulting from GraphDD provides orders of magnitude improvements to measured circuit fidelities compared with standard embedding approaches available in Qiskit.

TI Quantum Gaussian process model of potential energy surface for a
   polyatomic molecule
SO JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL PHYSICS
AB With gates of a quantum computer designed to encode multi-dimensional vectors, projections of quantum computer states onto specific qubit states can produce kernels of reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces. We show that quantum kernels obtained with a fixed ansatz implementable on current quantum computers can be used for accurate regression models of global potential energy surfaces (PESs) for polyatomic molecules. To obtain accurate regression models, we apply Bayesian optimization to maximize marginal likelihood by varying the parameters of the quantum gates. This yields Gaussian process models with quantum kernels. We illustrate the effect of qubit entanglement in the quantum kernels and explore the generalization performance of quantum Gaussian processes by extrapolating global six-dimensional PESs in the energy domain.

TI Storage of single photons from a semiconductor quantum dot in a
   room-temperature atomic vapor memory with on-demand retrieval
SO QUANTUM SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB Interfacing light from solid-state single-photon sources with scalable and robust room-temperature quantum memories has been a long-standing challenge in photonic quantum information technologies due to inherent noise processes and time-scale mismatches between the operating conditions of solid-state and atomic systems. Here, we demonstrate storage of single photons from a semiconductor quantum dot (QD) device in a room-temperature atomic vapor memory and their on-demand retrieval. A deterministically fabricated InGaAs QD light source emits single photons at the wavelength of the cesium D1 line at 895 nm which exhibit an inhomogeneously broadened linewidth of 5.1(7) GHz and are subsequently stored in a low-noise ladder-type cesium vapor memory. We show control over the interaction between the single photons and the atomic vapor, allowing for variable retrieval times of up to 19.8(3) ns. A maximum internal efficiency of eta int=0.6(1)% is achieved. Our results expand the application space of both room-temperature vapor memories and semiconductor QDs in future quantum network architectures.

TI Entanglement of General Two-Qubit States in a Realistic Framework
SO SYMMETRY-BASEL
AB In the present paper, we examine the quantum entanglement for more general states of two-qubit system in the context of spin coherent states (SCSs). We consider the concurrence as a quantifier of entanglement and express it in terms of SCSs. We determine new set of maximally entangled conditions that provide the maximal amount of entanglement for certain values of the amplitudes of SCSs for the case of pure states. Finally, we examine the entanglement of a class of mixed states of the two qubits and provide the range in which the entanglement value is maximal with respect to the values of the amplitudes of SCSs.

TI Renyi Entropy, Signed Probabilities, and the Qubit
SO ENTROPY
AB The states of the qubit, the basic unit of quantum information, are 2 x 2 positive semi-definite Hermitian matrices with trace 1. We contribute to the program to axiomatize quantum mechanics by characterizing these states in terms of an entropic uncertainty principle formulated on an eight-point phase space. We do this by employing Renyi entropy (a generalization of Shannon entropy) suitably defined for the signed phase-space probability distributions that arise in representing quantum states.

TI Synthetic High Angular Momentum Spin Dynamics in a Microwave Oscillator
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW X
AB Spins and oscillators are foundational to much of physics and applied sciences. For quantum information, a spin 1/2 exemplifies the most basic unit, a qubit. High angular momentum spins (HAMSs) and harmonic oscillators provide multilevel manifolds which have the potential for hardware-efficient protected encodings of quantum information and simulation of many-body quantum systems. In this work, we demonstrate a new quantum control protocol that conceptually merges these disparate hardware platforms. Namely, we show how to modify a harmonic oscillator on demand to implement a continuous range of generators to accomplish linear and nonlinear HAMS dynamics. The spinlike dynamics are verified by demonstration of linear spin coherent [SU(2)] rotations, nonlinear spin rotations, and comparison to other manifolds like simply truncated oscillators. Our scheme allows universal control of a spin cat logical qubit encoding with interpretable drive pulses: We use linear operations to accomplish four logical gates and further show that nonlinear spin rotations can complete the logical gate set. Our results show how motion on a closed Hilbert space can be useful for quantum information processing and opens the door to superconducting circuit simulations of higher angular momentum quantum magnetism.

TI Multi-server blind quantum computation protocol with limited classical
   communication among servers
SO QUANTUM INFORMATION PROCESSING
AB A user who does not have a quantum computer but wants to perform quantum computations may delegate his/her computation to a quantum cloud server. For users securely using the service, it must be assured that no malicious server can access any vital information about the computation. The blind protocol was proposed as a mechanism for users to secure their information from unauthorized actions of the server. Among the blind protocols proposed thus far, a protocol with two servers sharing entanglement does not require any quantum resource from the user but does not allow the servers to interact even after the computation. We propose a protocol in this paper that extends this two-server protocol to multiple servers and is secure even if some servers communicate with each other after the computation. Dummy gates and a circuit modeled after brickwork states play a crucial role in the new protocol.

TI Measurable Improvement in Multi-Qubit Readout Using a Kinetic Inductance
   Traveling Wave Parametric Amplifier
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON APPLIED SUPERCONDUCTIVITY
AB Increasing the size and complexity of quantum information systems requires highly-multiplexed readout architectures, as well as amplifier chains operating near the quantum limit (QL) of added noise. While documented prior efforts in KI-TWPA integration in quantum systems are scarce, in this work we demonstrate integration of a KI-TWPA with a multiplexed-qubit device. To quantify the system noise improvement we perform an ac Stark shift calibration to precisely determine noise power levels on-chip (at each cavity's reference plane) and the total system gain. We then characterize the qubit state measurement fidelity and the corresponding signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). To conduct the most faithful measurement of the benefits offered by the KI-TWPA we perform these measurements for readout chains where the high electron mobility transistor (HEMT) amplifier is the first-stage amplifier (FSA) - with none of the external hardware required to operate the KI-TWPA - and with the KI-TWPA as the FSA. While some readout cavities fall outside the KI-TWPA bandwidth, for those inside the bandwidth we demonstrate a maximum improvement in the state measurement SNR by a factor of 1.45, and increase the fidelity from 96.2% to 97.8%. These measurements demonstrate a system noise below 5 quanta referenced on-chip and we bound the KI-TWPA excess noise to be below 4 quanta for the six cavities inside its bandwidth. These results show a promising path forward for realizing quantum-limited readout chains in large qubit systems using a single parametric amplifier.

TI Barycentric and pairwise Rényi quantum leakage with application to
   privacy-utility trade-off
SO PROCEEDINGS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY A-MATHEMATICAL PHYSICAL AND ENGINEERING
   SCIENCES
AB Barycentric and pairwise quantum R & eacute;nyi leakages are proposed as two measures of information leakage for privacy and security analysis in quantum computing and communication systems. These quantities both require minimal assumptions on the eavesdropper, i.e. they do not make any assumptions on the eavesdropper's attack strategy or the statistical prior on the secret or private classical data encoded in the quantum system. They also satisfy important properties of positivity, independence, post-processing inequality and unitary invariance. The barycentric quantum R & eacute;nyi leakage can be computed by solving a semi-definite program; the pairwise quantum R & eacute;nyi leakage possesses an explicit formula. The barycentric and pairwise quantum R & eacute;nyi leakages form upper bounds on the maximal quantum leakage, the sandwiched quantum alpha-mutual information, the accessible information and the Holevo's information. Furthermore, differentially private quantum channels are shown to bound these measures of information leakage. Global and local depolarizing channels, that are common models of noise in quantum computing and communication, restrict private or secure information leakage. Finally, a privacy-utility trade-off formula in quantum machine learning using variational circuits is developed. The privacy guarantees can only be strengthened, i.e. information leakage can only be reduced, if the performance degradation grows larger and vice versa.

TI Ethernet Passive Mutual Authentication Scheme on Quantum Networks
SO ENTROPY
AB In the context of increasing demand for secure and efficient communication networks, addressing the issue of mutual authentication in ethernet passive optical networks (EPONs) has become both valuable and practically significant. This paper proposes a solution based on ideal lattices. The proposed scheme leverages the security of the ring learning with errors (RLWE) problem to establish a robust public-key cryptosystem. By involving ONUs, OLTs, and an SDN controller in the authentication process, it enables mutual authentication through a series of message exchanges facilitated by the SDN controller. Utilizing approximate smooth projection hash functions for secure key exchange and verification, the scheme ensures robust security performance against various attacks, including man-in-the-middle, impersonation, replay, and known key secrecy attacks. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed solution introduces minimal delay and maintains a high registration success rate compared to traditional authentication methods. Additionally, this paper explores the convergence of quantum network protocols with EPONs, highlighting their potential to achieve unprecedented levels of communication security. Integrating quantum technology with EPON networks, due to the unique security properties of quantum, can also better prevent man-in-the-middle attacks. Secure interception detection techniques based on fundamental quantum properties provide a fundamental security direction for future communication systems, aligning with the growing interest in quantum-resistant cryptographic protocols.

AB In recent years, quantum communications have garnered considerable attention for their potential to enhance network security. Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) protocols, which promise theoretically secure key generation for remote nodes, have been a primary focus. However, QKD faces significant challenges due to its limited range, especially for fiber-based channels, until quantum repeaters are technologically feasible. Consequently, research efforts have been redirected towards secure communication via QKD nodes within multi-hop networks, as a first step towards realizing the quantum internet. In this paper, we propose and analyze a key relay protocol (KRP) for secure quantum key generation within a three-node network, which can be extended to more than two hops in a straightforward manner. We analyzed security under two different sets of assumptions at each node plus accurately evaluated the achievable key rate via numerical methods. Finally, we discuss the advantages and limitations of the proposed protocol.

TI Oscillator-to-Oscillator Codes Do Not Have a Threshold
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INFORMATION THEORY
AB It is known that continuous variable quantum information cannot be protected against naturally occurring noise using Gaussian states and operations only. Noh et al. proposed bosonic oscillator-to-oscillator codes relying on non-Gaussian resource states as an alternative, and showed that these encodings can lead to a reduction of the effective error strength at the logical level as measured by the variance of the classical displacement noise channel. An oscillator-to-oscillator code embeds K logical bosonic modes (in an arbitrary state) into N physical modes by means of a Gaussian N-mode unitary and N-K auxiliary one-mode Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill-states. Here we ask if - in analogy to qubit error-correcting codes - there are families of oscillator-to-oscillator codes with the following threshold property: They allow to convert physical displacement noise with variance below some threshold value to logical noise with variance upper bounded by any (arbitrary) constant. We find that this is not the case if encoding unitaries involving a constant amount of squeezing and maximum likelihood error decoding are used. We show a general lower bound on the logical error probability which is only a function of the amount of squeezing and independent of the number of modes. As a consequence, any physically implementable family of oscillator-to-oscillator codes combined with maximum likelihood error decoding does not admit a threshold.

TI Improving entanglement generation rates in trapped-ion quantum networks
   using nondestructive photon measurement and storage
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Long-range quantum information processing will require the integration of different technologies to form hybrid architectures combining the strengths of multiple quantum systems. In this work, we propose a hybrid networking architecture designed to improve entanglement rates in quantum networks based on trapped ions. Trapped ions are excellent candidates as network nodes, but photon losses make long-distance networking difficult. To overcome some losses and extend the range of trapped-ion-based networks, we propose including neutral-atom-based nondestructive single-photon detection and single-photon storage in between networking nodes, forming a hybrid network. This work builds on recently demonstrated optical frequency conversion of single photons emitted by trapped ions. We derive the average two-node entanglement rate for this proposed network architecture as a function of distance. Using reasonable experimental parameters, we show that this proposed quantum network can generate remote entanglement rates up to a factor of 100 larger than that of an equivalent homogeneous network at both near-IR and C-band wavelengths for distances up to 50 km.

TI Two-dimensional coherent spectrum of high-spin models via a quantum
   computing approach
SO QUANTUM SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB We present and benchmark a quantum computing approach to calculate the two-dimensional coherent spectrum (2DCS) of high-spin models. Our approach is based on simulating their real-time dynamics in the presence of several magnetic field pulses, which are spaced in time. We utilize the adaptive variational quantum dynamics simulation algorithm for the study due to its compact circuits, which enables simulations over sufficiently long times to achieve the required resolution in frequency space. Specifically, we consider an antiferromagnetic quantum spin model that incorporates Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interactions and single-ion anisotropy. The obtained 2DCS spectra exhibit distinct peaks at multiples of the magnon frequency, arising from transitions between different eigenstates of the unperturbed Hamiltonian. By comparing the one-dimensional coherent spectrum with 2DCS, we demonstrate that 2DCS provides a higher resolution of the energy spectrum. We further investigate how the quantum resources scale with the magnitude of the spin using two different binary encodings of the high-spin operators: the standard binary encoding and the Gray code. At low magnetic fields both encodings require comparable quantum resources, but at larger field strengths the Gray code is advantageous. Numerical simulations for spin models with increasing number of sites indicate a polynomial system-size scaling for quantum resources. Lastly, we compare the numerical 2DCS with experimental results on a rare-earth orthoferrite system. The observed strength of the magnonic high-harmonic generation signals in the 2DCS of the quantum high-spin model aligns well with the experimental data, showing significant improvement over the corresponding mean-field results.

TI Single-flux-quantum-based qubit control with tunable driving strength
SO CHINESE PHYSICS B
AB Single-flux-quantum (SFQ) circuits have great potential in building cryogenic quantum-classical interfaces for scaling up superconducting quantum processors. SFQ-based quantum gates have been designed and realized. However, current control schemes are difficult to tune the driving strength to qubits, which restricts the gate length and usually induces leakage to unwanted levels. In this study, we design the scheme and corresponding pulse generator circuit to continuously adjust the driving strength by coupling SFQ pulses with variable intervals. This scheme not only provides a way to adjust the SFQ-based gate length, but also proposes the possibility to tune the driving strength envelope. Simulations show that our scheme can suppress leakage to unwanted levels and reduce the error of SFQ-based Clifford gates by more than an order of magnitude.

TI More optimal relativistic quantum key distribution
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB A great challenge in the field of quantum cryptography is the design and implementation of optimal quantum key distribution (QKD) scheme. An optimal scheme in terms of security is the so-called relativistic quantum key distribution; it ensures the security of the system by using both quantum phenomena and relativity. However, the existing relativistic schemes have not demonstrated optimality in terms of efficiency and rate (including secret key rate). Here we report two point-to-point relativistic quantum key distribution schemes implemented with weak coherent pulses. Both schemes rely on high-dimensional quantum systems (phase and polarization encodings are utilized for establishing key bits). One of the proposed schemes is a system comprised of two sequentially connected interferometers, as the first (interferometer) controls the behavior of the second one. The other proposed scheme represents a setup of a classic relativistic QKD, but with slight modification. Both of the proposed schemes are characterized with high secret key rate. The latter scheme has the highest secret key rate of all the relativistic QKD protocols. However, the values for the secret key rate are relevant for distances of up to 150 km. The former scheme has lower secret key rate, but longer operating distances (the work could operate at distances of up to 320 km). Those values of rate are obtained without disturbing the security. Secret-key-rate comparison between distinct models is reported. The proposed relativistic models are compared to twin-field QKD protocols. Furthermore, the work proposes a metric for evaluating the optimality of a QKD. It is defined as a ratio between the secret key rate (at a given distance) and the amount of quantum resources (qubits) used in the QKD of concern. It is shown that one of the proposed schemes in this article is the most optimal relativistic key distribution and more optimal than the original twin-field. It is also verified that the proposed schemes excels the original twin-field in terms of secret key rate, but for short distances.

AB We present an approach to solve the NP-hard database index selection problem on a D-Wave 2X adiabatic quantum annealer with over 1000 qubits. One of our main contributions is an efficient algorithm that maps instances of the index selection problem onto the qubits of the quantum annealer. Our mapping algorithm introduces several novel techniques that have not been used in the context of quantum annealing so far. Compared to prior approaches, we exploit qubits more efficiently which increases the size of the problem instances that can be represented with the given number of qubits by orders of magnitude. Furthermore, our algorithm decreases mapping time by many orders of magnitude compared to prior methods. The fundamental ideas that we present in this paper are applicable to similar optimization problems (e.g., other database related tuning problems). We analyze our algorithm formally and present experimental results on a real quantum annealer located at NASA Ames Research Center in California.

TI Quantum machine learning with differential privacy
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB Quantum machine learning (QML) can complement the growing trend of using learned models for a myriad of classification tasks, from image recognition to natural speech processing. There exists the potential for a quantum advantage due to the intractability of quantum operations on a classical computer. Many datasets used in machine learning are crowd sourced or contain some private information, but to the best of our knowledge, no current QML models are equipped with privacy-preserving features. This raises concerns as it is paramount that models do not expose sensitive information. Thus, privacy-preserving algorithms need to be implemented with QML. One solution is to make the machine learning algorithm differentially private, meaning the effect of a single data point on the training dataset is minimized. Differentially private machine learning models have been investigated, but differential privacy has not been thoroughly studied in the context of QML. In this study, we develop a hybrid quantum-classical model that is trained to preserve privacy using differentially private optimization algorithm. This marks the first proof-of-principle demonstration of privacy-preserving QML. The experiments demonstrate that differentially private QML can protect user-sensitive information without signficiantly diminishing model accuracy. Although the quantum model is simulated and tested on a classical computer, it demonstrates potential to be efficiently implemented on near-term quantum devices [noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ)]. The approach's success is illustrated via the classification of spatially classed two-dimensional datasets and a binary MNIST classification. This implementation of privacy-preserving QML will ensure confidentiality and accurate learning on NISQ technology.

TI Universal Quantum Computation via Scalable Measurement-Free Error
   Correction
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB We show that universal quantum computation can be concretely made fault-tolerant without mid-circuit measurements. To this end, we introduce a measurement-free deformation protocol of the Bacon-Shor code to realize a logical CCZ gate. Combined with a fold-transversal logical Hadamard gate, this enables a universal set of fault-tolerant operations using only transversal gates and qubit permutations. For the purpose of benchmarking under circuit-level noise, we develop an efficient method to simulate non-Clifford circuits with a small number of Hadamard gates. Separately, we demonstrate that certain CSS codes can be concatenated without measurements or having to rely on a universal logical gate set. This is made possible by means of a resource-efficient gadget-termed the "disposable Toffoli gadget"-that realizes the errorcorrecting feedback. Then, under concatenation of the Bacon-Shor code, we observe a fault-tolerance threshold at a circuit-level depolarizing noise rate of approximately 0.12%. Together, the deformation and concatenation protocols outline a blueprint for a fully fault-tolerant architecture without any feed-forward operation, particularly suited to state-of-the-art neutral-atom platforms.

TI Plug&Play subcarrier wave quantum key distribution with deep modulation
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB We report a quantum key distribution using subcarrier wave encoding in Plug&Play configuration. Our detailed study shows how subcarrier encoding operates in a presence of Rayleigh back-scattering, chromatic dispersion and other experimental negative factors that occur in Plug&Play configuration. We propose and experimentally demonstrate a novel regime for the subcarrier wave encoding, where simultaneous detection of two logical states in a single basis is combined with robustness and simplicity of the original protocol. This deep modulation regime shows reliable quantum communication with losses up to 20 dB and promises a twice increase in secret key generation rate in comparison with the original subcarrier wave quantum key distribution in one-way or Plug&Play configurations.

TI Performance Analysis of High-Dimensional Orbital Angular Momentum
   Entanglement Distribution on Unmanned Aerial Vehicle Platforms
SO ADVANCED QUANTUM TECHNOLOGIES
AB Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) emerge as a flexible and cost-effective solution for mobile quantum communication, showing significant potential. Despite the challenges posed by environmental noise in free-space channels for efficient entanglement distribution, the noise-resistant properties of high-dimensional (HD) quantum states provide a promising solution to these issues. This work establishes a HD orbital angular momentum (OAM) entanglement distribution model on a UAV platform, systematically analyzing the effects of environmental conditions and platform parameters. Based on this model, a HD subspace coding protocol is investigated, with optimized subspace dimension and mode sets to enhance the performance. Furthermore, the use of the source modulation technique can significantly improve the key rate and transmission distance of the system. This work holds important implications for expanding UAV platform coverage, improving adaptability to environmental factors, and advancing the development of heterogeneous quantum networks.

TI Quantum Communication with Ultrafast Time-Bin Qubits
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB The photonic temporal degree of freedom is one of the most promising platforms for quantum communication over fiber networks and free-space channels. In particular, time-bin states of photons are robust to environmental disturbances, support high-rate communication, and can be used in high-dimensional schemes. However, the detection of photonic time-bin states remains a challenging task, particularly for the case of photons that are in a superposition of different time bins. Here, we experimentally demonstrate the feasibility of picosecond time-bin states of light, known as ultrafast time bins, for applications in quantum communications. With the ability to measure time-bin superpositions with excellent phase stability, we enable the use of temporal states in efficient quantum key distribution protocols such as the BB84 protocol.

AB Fathoming out quantum state space is a challenging endeavor due to its exponentially growing dimensionality. At the expense of being bound in its expressiveness, the discrete and finite subspace of graph states is easier to investigate via a pictorial framework accompanied with a theoretical toolkit from the stabilizer formalism. Analyzing hand-drawn graphs is a tedious and time-consuming task and imposes limitations to the problem sizes that can be addressed. Similarly, algorithmic studies using adjacency matrices alone lack the benefit of a visual representation of the states. We argue that applying visual analytics to investigate graph states can be advantageous. To this end, we introduce GRAPHSTATEVIS, a web-based application for the visual analysis of qubit graph states and their stabilizer groups. Our tool facilitates the interactive construction of a graph through multiple components supported by linking and brushing. The user can explore graph-state-specific properties, including the Pauli-weight distribution of its stabilizer operators and noise thresholds for entanglement criteria. We propose a use case in the context of near-term quantum algorithms to illustrate the capabilities of our prototype. We provide access to GRAPHSTATEVIS as an open-source project and invite the broader quantum computing and engineering communities to take advantage of this tool and further boost its development.

TI A chip-integrated homodyne detection system with enhanced bandwidth
   performance for quantum applications
SO QUANTUM SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB The rapid development of quantum technology has driven the need for high-performance quantum signal processing modules. Balanced homodyne detector (BHD) is one of the most promising options for practical quantum state measurement, providing substantial advantages of cost-effectiveness, no cooling requirement, and system compactness. However, due to the stringent requirements in BHD design, it typically suffers from a relatively small operating bandwidth which limits the overall speed of a quantum system. In this study, we propose comprehensive modelling for the BHD in quantum applications and enhance the performance of BHDs based on our modelling. Specifically, we utilise a photonic chip approach and optimise the electronic design to create the integrated BHD, which significantly boosts the 3 dB bandwidth to 4.75 GHz and achieves a shot-noise-limited bandwidth of 23 GHz. We demonstrate the capability of this setup to generate quantum random numbers at a rate of 240 Gbit s-1, highlighting its potential for ultra-high-speed quantum communication and quantum cryptography applications.

However, with the exception of Trotter-based methods, which suffer from suboptimal scaling with respect to simulation precision, existing simulation techniques are, for the most part, too intricate to implement on early fault-tolerant quantum hardware. We propose a quantum Hamiltonian dynamics simulation algorithm that aims to be both straightforward to implement and, at the same time, have near-optimal scaling in simulation precision.

TI Variational quantum one-class classifier
SO MACHINE LEARNING-SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB One-class classification (OCC) is a fundamental problem in pattern recognition with a wide range of applications. This work presents a semi-supervised quantum machine learning algorithm for such a problem, which we call a variational quantum one-class classifier (VQOCC). The algorithm is suitable for noisy intermediate-scale quantum computing because the VQOCC trains a fully-parameterized quantum autoencoder with a normal dataset and does not require decoding. The performance of the VQOCC is compared with that of the one-class support vector machine (OC-SVM), the kernel principal component analysis (PCA), and the deep convolutional autoencoder (DCAE) using handwritten digit and Fashion-MNIST datasets. The numerical experiment examined various structures of VQOCC by varying data encoding, the number of parameterized quantum circuit layers, and the size of the latent feature space. The benchmark shows that the classification performance of VQOCC is comparable to that of OC-SVM and PCA, although the number of model parameters grows only logarithmically with the data size. The quantum algorithm outperformed DCAE in most cases under similar training conditions. Therefore, our algorithm constitutes an extremely compact and effective machine learning model for OCC.

TI Quantum Simulation of Dissipative Collective Effects on Noisy Quantum
   Computers
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB Dissipative collective effects are ubiquitous in quantum physics and their relevance ranges from the study of entanglement in biological systems to noise mitigation in quantum computers. Here, we put forward the first fully quantum simulation of dissipative collective phenomena on a real quantum computer, based on the recently introduced multipartite-collision model. First, we theoretically study the accuracy of this algorithm on near-term quantum computers with noisy gates and we derive some rigorous error bounds that depend on the time step of the collision model and on the gate errors. These bounds can be employed to estimate the necessary resources for the efficient quantum simulation of the collective dynamics. Then, we implement the algorithm on some IBM quantum computers to simulate superradiance and subradiance between a pair of qubits. Our experimental results successfully display the emergence of collective effects in the quantum simulation. In addition, we analyze the noise properties of the gates that we employ in the algorithm by means of full process tomography, with the aim of improving our understanding of the errors in the near-term devices that are currently accessible to worldwide researchers. We obtain the values of the average gate fidelity, unitarity, incoherence, and diamond error and we establish a connection between them and the accuracy of the experimentally simulated state. Moreover, we build a noise model based on the results of the process tomography for two-qubit gates and show that its performance is comparable with the noise model provided by IBM. Finally, we observe that the scaling of the error as a function of the number of gates is favorable, but at the same time reaching the threshold of the diamond errors for quantum fault-tolerant computation may still be orders of magnitude away in the devices that we employ.

TI Characterization of control in a superconducting qutrit using randomized
   benchmarking
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB We characterize control of a qutrit implemented in the lowest three energy levels of a capacitively shunted flux-biased superconducting circuit. Randomized benchmarking over the qutrit Clifford group yields an average fidelity of 98.89 +/- 0.05%. For a selected subset of the Clifford group, we perform quantum process tomography and observe the behavior of repeated gate sequences. Each qutrit gate is generated using only two-state rotations via a method applicable to any unitary. We find that errors are due primarily to decoherence and have a significant contribution from level shifts. This work demonstrates high-fidelity qutrit control and outlines avenues for future work on the optimal control of superconducting qudits.

TI Probing the Kitaev honeycomb model on a neutral-atom quantum computer
SO NATURE
AB Quantum simulations of many-body systems are among the most promising applications of quantum computers(1). In particular, models based on strongly correlated fermions are central to our understanding of quantum chemistry and materials problems(2), and can lead to exotic, topological phases of matter(3,4). However, owing to the non-local nature of fermions, such models are challenging to simulate with qubit devices(5). Here we realize a digital quantum simulation architecture for two-dimensional fermionic systems based on reconfigurable atom arrays(6). We utilize a fermion-to-qubit mapping based on Kitaev's model on a honeycomb lattice(3), in which fermionic statistics are encoded using long-range entangled states(7). We prepare these states efficiently using measurement(8) and feedforward(9), realize subsequent fermionic evolution through Floquet engineering(10,11) with tunable entangling gates(12) interspersed with atom rearrangement, and improve results with built-in error detection. Leveraging this fermion description of the Kitaev spin model, we efficiently prepare topological states across its complex phase diagram(13) and verify the non-Abelian spin-liquid phase(3) by evaluating an odd Chern number(14,15). We further explore this two-dimensional fermion system by realizing tunable dynamics and directly probing fermion exchange statistics. Finally, we simulate strong interactions and study the dynamics of the Fermi-Hubbard model on a square lattice. These results pave the way for digital quantum simulations of complex fermionic systems for materials science, chemistry(16) and high-energy physics(17).

SO JOURNAL OF KING SAUD UNIVERSITY COMPUTER AND INFORMATION SCIENCES
AB Nuclear Command and Control Center (NCCC) security must be considered a high priority in the nation, country, and ultimately humanity's best interest. Presently, with the expanding nuclear security risks, it is pivotal to guarantee that malevolent agent never acquires nuclear access. The purpose of this manuscript is to develop Cognitively Managed Multi-Level Authentication (CMMLA) through a collaboration among Cognitive Computing (CC), Quantum Computing (QC) and Cyber Security (CS). Thus, the proposed scheme will provide NCCC with the capability of self-learning, management, inherent security, rigorous, and reliable authentication protocols. Fuzzy Logic-based Quantum Key Distribution (FLQKD) is used to implement CMMLA and perform the experimentation for tangible results over the Simulink from MATLAB R2021a. For the reliability analysis of irregular Charles H. Bennett and Gilles Brassard 1984, (BB84) algorithm that we used and is a variant of Quantum Key Distribution (QKD), experimentation is done through an online QKD Simulator.

TI Quantum entropy as a harbinger of factorizability
SO PHYSICS LETTERS B
AB Deeply inelastic scattering (DIS) is a powerful probe for investigating the QCD structure of hadronic matter and testing the standard model (SM). DIS can be described through QCD factorization theorems which separate contributions to the scattering interaction arising from disparate scales - e.g., with nonperturbative matrix elements associated with long distances and a perturbative hard scattering kernel applying to short-distance parton-level interactions. The fundamental underpinnings of factorization maybe recast in the quantum-theoretic terms of entanglement, (de)coherence, and system localization in a fashion which sheds complementary light the dynamics at work in DIS from QCD bound states. In this Letter, we propose and quantitatively test such quantum-information theoretic approach for dissecting factorization in DIS and its domain of validity; we employ metrics associated with quantum entanglement such as a differential quantum entropy and associated Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergences in numerical tests. We deploy these methods on an archetypal quark-spectator model of the proton, for which we monitor quantum decoherence in DIS as underlying model parameters are varied. On this basis, we demonstrate quantitatively how factorization-breaking effects may be imprinted on quantum entropies in a kinematic regime where leading-twist factorization increasingly receives large corrections from finite-Q2 effects; our findings suggest potential applications of quantum simulation to QCD systems and interactions.

TI On the General Entangled State and Quantum Decoherence
SO UNIVERSE
AB We study the primary entanglement effect on the decoherence of reduced-density matrices of scalar fields, which interact with other fields or independent mode functions. We study the (leading) tree-level evolution of the scalar bispectrum due to a coupling between two scalar fields. We show that the primary entanglement has a significant role in the decoherence of the given quantum state. We find that the existence of such an entanglement could couple dynamical equations coming from a Schrodinger equation. We show that if one wants to see no effect of the entanglement parameter in the decohering of the quantum system, then the ground state eigenvalues of the interaction terms in the Hamiltonian cannot be independent of each other Generally, including the primary entanglement destroys the independence of the interaction terms in the ground state. We show that the imaginary part of the entanglement parameter plays an important role in the decoherence process without posing any specific restriction to the interaction terms. Our results could be generalized to every scalar quantum field theory with a well-defined quantization of its fluctuations in a given curved space-time.

TI Delocalization of quantum information in long-range interacting systems
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB We investigate the delocalization of quantum information in the nonequilibrium dynamics of the XY spin chain with asymptotically decaying interactions similar to 1/r(alpha). As a figure of merit, we employ the tripartite mutual information (TMI), the sign of which indicates if quantum information is predominantly shared globally. Interestingly, the sign of the TMI distinguishes regimes of the exponent alpha that are known for different behaviors of information propagation. While an effective causal region bounds the propagation of information, if interactions decay sufficiently fast, this information is mainly delocalized, which leads to the necessity of global measurements. Furthermore, the results indicate that mutual information is monogamous for all possible partitionings in this case, implying that quantum entanglement is the dominant correlation. If interactions decay sufficiently slow, though information can propagate (quasi-)instantaneously, it is mainly accessible by local measurements at early times. Furthermore, it takes some finite time until correlations start to become monogamous, which suggests that entanglement is not the dominant correlation at early times. Our findings give new insights into the dynamics and structure of quantum information in many-body systems with long-range interactions, and might get verified on state-of-the-art experimental platforms.

TI Engineering an effective three-spin Hamiltonian in trapped-ion systems
   for applications in quantum simulation
SO QUANTUM SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB Trapped-ion quantum simulators, in analog and digital modes, are considered a primary candidate to achieve quantum advantage in quantum simulation and quantum computation. The underlying controlled ion-laser interactions induce all-to-all two-spin interactions via the collective modes of motion through Cirac-Zoller or Molmer-Sorensen schemes, leading to effective two-spin Hamiltonians, as well as two-qubit entangling gates. In this work, the Molmer-Sorensen scheme is extended to induce three-spin interactions via tailored first- and second-order spin-motion couplings. The scheme enables engineering single-, two-, and three-spin interactions, and can be tuned via an enhanced protocol to simulate purely three-spin dynamics. Analytical results for the effective evolution are presented, along with detailed numerical simulations of the full dynamics to support the accuracy and feasibility of the proposed scheme for near-term applications. With a focus on quantum simulation, the advantage of a direct analog implementation of three-spin dynamics is demonstrated via the example of matter-gauge interactions in the U(1) lattice gauge theory within the quantum link model. The mapping of degrees of freedom and strategies for scaling the three-spin scheme to larger systems, are detailed, along with a discussion of the expected outcome of the simulation of the quantum link model given realistic fidelities in the upcoming experiments. The applications of the three-spin scheme go beyond the lattice gauge theory example studied here and include studies of static and dynamical phase diagrams of strongly interacting condensed-matter systems modeled by two- and three-spin Hamiltonians.

TI Dynamic DV-QKD Networking in Trusted-Node-Free Software-Defined Optical
   Networks
SO JOURNAL OF LIGHTWAVE TECHNOLOGY
AB We demonstrate for the first time a four-node trusted-node-free metro network configuration with dynamic discrete-variable quantum key distribution DV-QKD networking capabilities across four optical network nodes. The network allows the dynamic deployment of any QKD link between two nodes of the network, while a QKD-aware centralised software-defined networking (SDN) controller is utilised to provide dynamicity in switching and rerouting. The feasibility of coexisting a quantum channel with carrier-grade classical optical channels where both the quantum and classical channels are in the C-band over field-deployed metropolitan networks and laboratory-based fibres (<10 km) is experimentally explored in terms of achievable quantum bit error rate, secret key rate as well as classical signal bit error rate. Moreover, coexistence analysis over multi-hops configuration using different switching scenarios is also presented. The secret key rate dropped 43% when coexisting one classical channel with 150 GHz spacing from the quantum channel for multiple links. This is due to the noise leakage from the Raman scattering into the 100 GHz bandwidth of the internal filter of the Bob DV-QKD unit. When coexisting four classical channels with 150 GHz spacing between quantum and the nearest classical channel, the quantum channel deteriorates faster due to the combination of Raman noise, other nonlinearities and high aggregated launch power causing the QBER value to exceed the threshold of 6% leading the SKR to reach a value of zero bps at a launch power of 7 dB per channel. Furthermore, the coexistence of a quantum channel and six classical channels through a field-deployed fibre test network is examined.

AB 5G has been launched in a few countries of the world, so now all focus shifted towards the development of future 6G networks. 5G has connected all aspects of society. Ubiquitous connectivity has opened the doors for more data sharing. Although 5G is providing low latency, higher data rates, and high-speed yet there are some security-related vulnerabilities. Those security issues need to be mitigated for securing 6G networks from existing challenges. Classical cryptography will not remain enough for securing the 6G network. As all classical cryptography can be disabled with the help of quantum mechanics.

TI Cooperative quantum information erasure
SO QUANTUM

The method displays exceptional performances in terms of energy cost (it operates nearly at Landauer en-ergy cost kT ln 2), time duration (s, ??s) and erasure success rate (s, 99, 9%). The method departs from the standard algorithmic cool-ing paradigm by exploiting cooperative effects associated to the mechanism of spontaneous symmetry breaking which are amplified by quantum tunnelling phenomena. Such coop-erative quantum erasure protocol is experi-mentally demonstrated on a commercial quan-tum annealer and could be readily applied in next generation hybrid gate-based/quantum-annealing quantum computers, for fast, effec-tive, and energy efficient initialisation of quan-tum processing units.

TI Simulating neutrino oscillations on a superconducting qutrit
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW D
AB Neutrino oscillations are genuine quantum phenomena in which coherent oscillations are maintained over a long distance. As a result, in principle, the phenomena can be studied efficiently using quantum simulations. In today's noisy quantum hardware, encoding neutrinos in a multiqubit system requires a redundant basis and tricky entangling gates. We encode a three-flavor neutrino in a superconducting qutrit and study its oscillations using Pontecorvo-Maki-Nakagawa-Sakata theory with time evolution expressed in terms of single qutrit gates. The qutrit is engineered from the multilevel structure of IBM transmon devices. High-fidelity gate control and readout are fine-tuned using programming microwave pulses using a high-level language. Our quantum simulations on real hardware match the analytical calculations well in three oscillation cases: vacuum, interaction with matter, and CP violation.

TI Indirect detection of gravitons through quantum entanglement
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW D
AB We propose an experiment that the entanglement between two macroscopic mirrors suspended at the end of an equal-arm interferometer is destroyed by the noise of gravitons through bremsstrahlung. By calculating the correlation function of the noise, we obtain the decoherence time from the decoherence functional. We estimate that the decoherence time induced by the noise of gravitons in squeezed states stemming from inflation is approximately 20 s for 40 km long arms and 40 kg mirrors. Our analysis shows that observation of the decoherence time of quantum entanglement has the potential to detect gravitons indirectly. This indirect detection of gravitons would give strong evidence of quantum gravity.

TI Loss-tolerant quantum key distribution with detection efficiency
   mismatch
SO QUANTUM SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB Current implementations of quantum key distribution (QKD) typically rely on prepare-and-measure (P&M) schemes. Unfortunately, these implementations are not completely secure, unless security proofs fully incorporate all imperfections of real devices. So far, existing proofs have primarily focused on imperfections of either the light source or the measurement device. In this paper, we establish a security proof for the loss-tolerant P&M QKD protocol that incorporates imperfections in both the source and the detectors. Specifically, we demonstrate the security of this scheme when the emitted states deviate from the ideal ones and Bob's measurement device does not meet the basis-independent detection efficiency condition. Furthermore, we conduct an experiment to characterise the detection efficiency mismatch of commercial single-photon detectors as a function of the polarisation state of the input light, and determine the expected secret key rate in the presence of state preparation flaws when using such detectors. Our work provides a way towards guaranteeing the security of actual implementations of widely deployed P&M QKD.

TI Quantum broadcast channels with cooperating decoders: An
   information-theoretic perspective on quantum repeaters
SO JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICAL PHYSICS
AB Communication over a quantum broadcast channel with cooperation between the receivers is considered. The first form of cooperation addressed is classical conferencing, where receiver 1 can send classical messages to receiver 2. Another cooperation setting involves quantum conferencing, where receiver 1 can teleport a quantum state to receiver 2. When receiver 1 is not required to recover information and its sole purpose is to help the transmission to receiver 2, the model reduces to the quantum primitive relay channel. The quantum conferencing setting is intimately related to quantum repeaters as the sender, receiver 1, and receiver 2 can be viewed as the transmitter, the repeater, and the destination receiver, respectively. We develop lower and upper bounds on the capacity region in each setting. In particular, the cutset upper bound and the decode-forward lower bound are derived for the primitive relay channel. Furthermore, we present an entanglement-formation lower bound, where a virtual channel is simulated through the conference link. At last, we show that as opposed to the multiple access channel with entangled encoders, entanglement between decoders does not increase the classical communication rates for the broadcast dual.

TI Thermodynamic Constraints on Quantum Information Gain and Error
   Correction: A Triple Trade-Off
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB Quantum error correction (QEC) is a procedure by which the quantum state of a system is protected against a known type of noise, by preemptively adding redundancy to that state. Such a procedure is commonly used in quantum computing when thermal noise is present. Interestingly, thermal noise has also been known to play a central role in quantum thermodynamics (QTD). This fact hints at the applicability of certain QTD statements in the QEC of thermal noise, which has been discussed previously in the context of Maxwell's demon. In this paper, we view QEC as a quantum heat engine with a feedback controller (i.e., a demon). We derive an upper bound on the measurement heat dissipated during the error-identification stage in terms of the Groenewold information gain, thereby also providing the latter with a physical meaning when it is negative. Further, we derive the second law of thermodynamics in the context of this QEC engine, operating with general quantum measurements. Finally, we show that, under a set of physically motivated assumptions, this leads to a fundamental triple-trade-off relation, which implies a trade-off between the maximum achievable fidelity of QEC and the super-Carrot efficiency that heat engines with feedback controllers have been known to possess. A similar trade-off relation occurs for the thermodynamic efficiency of the QEC engine and the efficacy of the quantum measurement used for error identification.

TI Optically detected magnetic resonance with an open source platform
SO SCIPOST PHYSICS CORE
AB Localized electronic spins in solid-state environments form versatile and robust platforms for quantum sensing, metrology and quantum information processing. With optically detected magnetic resonance (ODMR), it is possible to prepare and readout highly coherent spin systems, up to room temperature, with orders of magnitude enhanced sensitivities and spatial resolutions compared to induction-based techniques, allowing for single spin manipulations. While ODMR was first observed in organic molecules, many other systems have since then been identified. Among them is the nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center in diamond, which is used both as a nanoscale quantum sensor for external fields and as a spin qubit. Other systems permitting ODMR are rare earth ions used as quantum memories and many other color centers trapped in bulk or 2-dimensional host materials. In order to allow the broadest possible community of researchers and engineers to investigate and develop novel ODMR-based materials and applications, we review here the setting up of ODMR experiments using commercially available hardware. We also present in detail the dedicated collaborative open-source interface named Qudi and describe the features we added to speed-up data acquisition, relax instrument requirements and extend its applicability to ensemble measurements. Covering both hardware and software development, this article aims to overview the setting of ODMR experiments and provide an efficient, portable and collaborative interface to implement innovative experiments to optimize the development time of ODMR experiments for scientists of any backgrounds.

TI Experimental lower bounds to the classical capacity of quantum channels
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB We show an experimental procedure to certify the classical capacity for noisy qubit channels. The method makes use of a fixed bipartite entangled state, where the system qubit is sent to the channel input and the set of local measurements, sigma(x) circle times sigma(x), sigma(y) circle times sigma y, and sigma(z) circle times sigma(z), is performed at the channel output and the ancilla qubit, thus without resorting to full quantum process tomography. The witness to the classical capacity is then achieved by reconstructing sets of conditional probabilities, noise deconvolution, and classical optimization of the pertaining mutual information. The performance of the method to provide lower bounds to the classical capacity is tested by a two-photon polarization entangled state in Pauli channels and amplitude damping channels. The measured lower bounds to the channels are in high agreement with the simulated data, which take into account both the experimental entanglement fidelity F = 0.979 +/- 0.011 of the input state and the systematic experimental imperfections.

TI Vertical gate-defined double quantum dot in a strained germanium double
   quantum well
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW APPLIED
AB Gate-defined quantum dots in silicon-germanium heterostructures have become a compelling platform for quantum computation and simulation. Thus far, developments have been limited to quantum dots defined in a single plane. Here, we propose to advance beyond planar systems by exploiting heterostructures with multiple quantum wells. We demonstrate the operation of a gate-defined double quantum dot in a strained germanium double quantum well, where both quantum dots are tunnel coupled to both reservoirs and parallel transport occurs. We analyze the capacitive coupling to nearby gates and find both quantum dots to be accumulated under the central plunger gate. We extract their position and size, from which we conclude that the double quantum dots are vertically stacked in the two quantum wells. We discuss the challenges and opportunities of multilayer devices and outline some potential applications in quantum computing and quantum simulation.

TI Quantum state engineering and photon statistics at electromagnetic time
   interfaces
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Modulating macroscopic parameters of materials in time offers innovative avenues for manipulating electromagnetic waves. Due to such enticing prospects, the general research subject of time-varying systems is expanding today in different branches of electromagnetism and optics. However, compared with the research efforts and progresses that have taken place in the realm of classical electrodynamics, the quantum aspects of this emerging subject have been less explored. Here, through the lens of quantum optics, we study the scattering of electromagnetic fields from an isotropic and nondispersive material with a suddenly changing refractive index, creating a time interface. We revisit the transformation of the bosonic mode operators and corresponding quantum states due to this interface, governed by the two-mode squeeze operator. Building on this foundation, at the core of the investigation, our analysis focuses on the quantum state engineering and photon statistics of the scattered light. Notably, such an analysis reveals and connects various quantum optical phenomena and opportunities arising from the time interface, including photon-pair production and destruction, photon bunching and antibunching, vacuum generation, quantum state discrimination, and quantum state freezing. To bridge theory and experiment, we propose a possible circuit quantum electrodynamics approach for validating our theoretical predictions. We hope that our work inspires experimental investigations of such quantum state engineering and photon statistics phenomena, as well as further quantum optical explorations of electromagnetic field interaction with photonic time crystals or with dispersive time-varying materials.

AB To support multiple transmissions in an optical fiber, several techniques have been studied such as Optical Code Division Multiple Access (OCDMA). In particular, the incoherent OCDMA systems are appreciated for their simplicity and reduced cost. However, they suffer from Multiple Access Interference (MAI), which degrades the performances. In order to cope with this MAI, several detectors have been studied. Among them, the Maximum Likelihood (ML) detector is the optimal one but it suffers from high complexity as all possibilities have to be tested prior to decision. However, thanks to the recent quantum computing advances, the complexity problem can be circumvented. As a matter of fact, quantum algorithms, such as Grover, exploit the superposition states in the quantum domain to accelerate the computation. Thus, in this paper, we propose to adapt the quantum Grover's algorithm in the context of Multi-User Detection (MUD), in an OCDMA system using non-orthogonal codes. We propose a way to adapt the received noisy signal to the constraints defined by Grover's algorithm. We further evaluate the probability of success in detecting the active users for different noise levels. Aside from the complexity reduction, simulations show that our proposal has a high probability of detection when the received signal is not highly altered. We show the benefits of our proposal compared to the classical and the optimal ML detector.

TI Lower Bounds on Learning Pauli Channels With Individual Measurements
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INFORMATION THEORY
AB Understanding the noise affecting a quantum device is of fundamental importance for scaling quantum technologies. A particularly important class of noise models is that of Pauli channels, as randomized compiling techniques can effectively bring any quantum channel to this form and are significantly more structured than general quantum channels. In this paper, we show fundamental lower bounds on the sample complexity for learning Pauli channels in diamond norm. We consider strategies that may not use auxiliary systems entangled with the input to the unknown channel and have to perform a measurement before reusing the channel. For non-adaptive algorithms, we show a lower bound of Omega 1(2(3n)<euro>(-2)) to learn an n-qubit Pauli channel. In particular, this shows that the recently introduced learning procedure by Flammia and Wallman (2020) is essentially optimal. In the adaptive setting, we show a lower bound of Omega 1(2(2.5n)<euro>(-2)) for <euro> = O(2(-n)), and a lower bound of Omega 1(2(2n)<euro>(-2)) for any <euro> > 0. This last lower bound holds even in a stronger model where in each step, before performing the measurement, the unknown channel may be used arbitrarily many times sequentially interspersed with unital operations.

TI First Detailed Study of the Quantum Decoherence of Entangled Gamma
   Photons
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB Constraints on the quantum decoherence of entangled gamma quanta at the mega-electron-volt scale, such as those produced following positron annihilation, have remained elusive for many decades. We present the first statistically and kinematically precise experimental data for triple Compton scattering of such entangled gamma. An entanglement witness (R), R ), relating to the enhancement of the azimuthal correlation between the final scattering planes, is obtained where one of the gamma underwent intermediate Compton scattering. The measured R, deconvolved from multiple scattering backgrounds, are found to exceed the classical limit for intermediate scatter angles up to 60 degrees and diminish at larger angles. The data are consistent with predictions from a first quantum theory of entangled triple Compton scattering as well as a simple model based approach. The results are crucial to future study and utilization of entangled mega-electron-volt gamma in fundamental physics and positron emission tomography imaging.

TI High-performance superconducting quantum processors via laser annealing
   of transmon qubits
SO SCIENCE ADVANCES
AB Scaling the number of qubits while maintaining high-fidelity quantum gates remains a key challenge for quantum computing. Presently, superconducting quantum processors with >50 qubits are actively available. For these systems, fixed-frequency transmons are attractive because of their long coherence and noise immunity. However, scaling fixed-frequency architectures proves challenging because of precise relative frequency requirements. Here, we use laser annealing to selectively tune transmon qubits into desired frequency patterns. Statistics over hundreds of annealed qubits demonstrate an empirical tuning precision of 18.5 MHz, with no measurable impact on qubit coherence. We quantify gate error statistics on a tuned 65-qubit processor, with median two-qubit gate fidelity of 98.7%. Baseline tuning statistics yield a frequency-equivalent resistance precision of 4.7 MHz, sufficient for high-yield scaling beyond 10(3) qubit levels. Moving forward, we anticipate selective laser annealing to play a central role in scaling fixed-frequency architectures.

TI Relating Compatibility and Divisibility of Quantum Channels
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF THEORETICAL PHYSICS
AB We connect two key concepts in quantum information: compatibility and divisibility of quantum channels. Two channels are compatible if they can be both obtained via marginalization from a third channel. A channel divides another channel if it reproduces its action by sequential composition with a third channel. (In)compatibility is of central importance for studying the difference between classical and quantum dynamics. The relevance of divisibility stands in its close relationship with the onset of Markovianity. We emphasize the simulability character of compatibility and divisibility, and, despite their structural difference, we find a set of channels - self-degradable channels - for which the two notions coincide. We also show that, for degradable channels, compatibility implies divisibility, and that, for anti-degradable channels, divisibility implies compatibility. These results provide physical insights and motivate further research on these classes of channels and shed new light on the meaning of these two largely studied notions.

TI Cost function dependent barren plateaus in shallow parametrized quantum
   circuits
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Variational quantum algorithms (VQAs) optimize the parameters theta of a parametrized quantum circuit V(theta) to minimize a cost function C. While VQAs may enable practical applications of noisy quantum computers, they are nevertheless heuristic methods with unproven scaling. Here, we rigorously prove two results, assuming V(theta) is an alternating layered ansatz composed of blocks forming local 2-designs. Our first result states that defining C in terms of global observables leads to exponentially vanishing gradients (i.e., barren plateaus) even when V(theta) is shallow. Hence, several VQAs in the literature must revise their proposed costs. On the other hand, our second result states that defining C with local observables leads to at worst a polynomially vanishing gradient, so long as the depth of V(theta) is O(logn). Our results establish a connection between locality and trainability. We illustrate these ideas with large-scale simulations, up to 100 qubits, of a quantum autoencoder implementation. Parametrised quantum circuits are a promising hybrid classical-quantum approach, but rigorous results on their effective capabilities are rare. Here, the authors explore the feasibility of training depending on the type of cost functions, showing that local ones are less prone to the barren plateau problem.

TI Effect of source statistics on utilizing photon entanglement in quantum
   key distribution
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB A workflow for evaluation of entanglement source quality is proposed. Based on quantum state density matrices obtained from theoretical models and experimental data, we make an estimate of a potential performance of a quantum entanglement source in quantum key distribution protocols. This workflow is showcased for continuously pumped spontaneous parametric down-conversion (SPDC) source, where it highlights the trade-off between entangled pair generation rate and entanglement quality caused by multiphoton nature of the generated quantum states. We employ this characterization technique to show that secure key rate of down-converted photon pairs is limited to 0.029 bits per detection window due to intrinsic multiphoton contributions. We also report that there exists one optimum gain for continuous-wave down-conversion sources. We find a bound for secure key rate extracted from SPDC sources and make a comparison with perfectly single-pair quantum states, such as those produced by quantum dots.

SO CRYPTOGRAPHY
AB Significant advancements have been achieved in the field of quantum computing in recent years. If somebody ever creates a sufficiently strong quantum computer, many of the public-key cryptosystems in use today might be compromised. Kyber is a post-quantum encryption technique that depends on lattice problem hardness, and it was recently standardized. Despite extensive testing by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), new investigations have demonstrated the effectiveness of CRYSTALS-Kyber attacks and their applicability in non-controlled environments. We investigated CRYSTALS-Kyber's susceptibility to side-channel attacks. In the reference implementation of Kyber512, additional functions can be compromised by employing the selected ciphertext. The implementation of the selected ciphertext allows the attacks to succeed. Real-time recovery of the entire secret key is possible for all assaults.

Two entities, part of a greater system, decide they want to trade quantum goods: their exchange is configurable, and allows them to select the type of good, from a selected preset, and the desired quantity, up to a maximum value (one of the quantum goods can be interpreted as quantum money/a form of quantum currency). Certain qubits should also be used as a way of storing the details of the transfer, after it has been validated (acting in a similar way to a quantum ledger).

TI HammingVis: A visual analytics approach for understanding erroneous

SO GRAPHICAL MODELS
AB Advanced quantum computers have the capability to perform practical quantum computing to address specific problems that are intractable for classical computers. Nevertheless, these computers are susceptible to noise, leading to unexpectable errors in outcomes, which makes them less trustworthy. To address this challenge, we propose HammingVis, a visual analytics approach that helps identify and understand errors in quantum outcomes. Given that these errors exhibit latent structural patterns within Hamming space, we introduce two graph visualizations to reveal these patterns from distinct perspectives. One highlights the overall structure of errors, while the other focuses on the impact of errors within important subspaces. We further develop a prototype system for interactively exploring and discerning the correct outcomes within Hamming space. A novel design is presented to distinguish the neighborhood patterns between error and correct outcomes. The effectiveness of our approach is demonstrated through case studies involving two classic quantum algorithms' outcome data.

AB With the advent of more powerful Quantum Computers, the need for larger Quantum Simulations has boosted. As the amount of resources grows exponentially with size of the target system Tensor Networks emerge as an optimal framework with which we represent Quantum States in tensor factorizations. As the extent of a tensor network increases, so does the size of intermediate tensors requiring HPC tools for their manipulation. Simulations of medium-sized circuits cannot fit on local memory, and solutions for distributed contraction of tensors are scarce. In this work we present RosneT, a library for distributed, out-of-core block tensor algebra. We use the PyCOMPSs programming model to transform tensor operations into a collection of tasks handled by the COMPSs runtime, targeting executions in existing and upcoming Exascale supercomputers. We report results validating our approach showing good scalability in simulations of Quantum circuits of up to 53 qubits.

TI Complexity-Theoretic Limitations on Quantum Algorithms for Topological
   Data Analysis
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB Quantum algorithms for topological data analysis (TDA) seem to provide an exponential advantage over the best classical approach while remaining immune to dequantization procedures and the data-loading problem. In this paper, we give complexity-theoretic evidence that the central task of TDA-estimating Betti numbers-is intractable even for quantum computers. Specifically, we prove that the problem of computing Betti numbers exactly is #P-hard, while the problem of approximating Betti numbers up to multiplicative error is NP-hard. Moreover, both problems retain their hardness if restricted to the regime where quantum algorithms for TDA perform best. Because quantum computers are not expected to solve #P-hard or NP-hard problems in subexponential time, our results imply that quantum algorithms for TDA offer only a polynomial advantage in the worst case. We support our claim by showing that the seminal quantum algorithm for TDA developed by Lloyd, Garnerone, and Zanardi achieves a quadratic speedup over the best-known classical approach in asymptotically almost all cases. Finally, we argue that an expo-nential quantum advantage can be recovered if the input data is given as a specification of simplices rather than as a list of vertices and edges.

TI Probabilistic pulse-position modulation for classical communication on
   quantum channels
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Classical communication over lossy quantum channels is an essential topic in quantum information theory, with practical implications for optical-fiber and free-space communications. Multiphase Hadamard codes, based on coherent-state binary phase-shift keying (BPSK) modulation and decoded using vacuum-or-pulse (VP) detectors, offer a promising approach for achieving high communication rates while relying only on linear optics and single-photon detectors (SPDs). However, their performance does not reach the ultimate Holevo limit. In this work, we propose a generalization of Hadamard codes that distributes the signal across multiple modes with optimized probabilities, rather than concentrating it in a single mode, dubbed probabilistic pulse-position modulation (PPPM). We derive an achievable communication rate, demonstrating that our PPPM can outperform traditional Hadamard codes in certain intermediate energy regimes.

TI Coexistence of multiuser entanglement distribution and classical light
   in optical fi ber network with a semiconductor chip
SO CHIP
AB Building communication links among multiple users in a scalable and robust way is a key objective in achieving large-scale quantum networks. In a realistic scenario, noise from the coexisting classical light is inevitable and can ultimately disrupt the entanglement. The previous signi fi cant fully connected multiuser entanglement distribution experiments are conducted using dark fi ber links, and there is no explicit relation between the entanglement degradations induced by classical noise and its error rate. Here, a semiconductor chip with a high fi gure-of-merit modal overlap fabricated to directly generate broadband polarization entanglement. The monolithic source maintains the polarization entanglement fi delity of above 96% for 42 nm bandwidth, with brightness of 1.2 3 10 7 Hz mW - 1 . A continuously working quantum entanglement distribution are performed among three users coexisting with classical light. Under fi nite-key analysis, secure keys are established and images encryption are enabled well as quantum secret sharing between users. This work paves the way for practical multiparty quantum communication with integrated photonic architecture compatible with real-world fi ber optical communication network.

TI Lightweight Two-Factor-Based User Authentication Protocol for
   IoT-Enabled Healthcare Ecosystem in Quantum Computing
SO ARABIAN JOURNAL FOR SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING
AB The healthcare ecosystem is migrating from legacy systems to the Internet of Things (IoT), resulting in a digital environment. This transformation has increased importance on demanding both secure and usable user authentication methods. Recently, a post-quantum fuzzy commitment scheme (PQFC) has been constructed as a reliable and efficient method of biometric template protection. This paper presents a new two-factor-based user authentication protocol for the IoT-enabled healthcare ecosystem in post-quantum computing environments using the PQFC scheme. The proposed protocol is proved to be secure using random oracle model. Furthermore, the functionality and security of the proposed protocol are analyzed, showing that memoryless-effortless, user anonymity, mutual authentication, and resistance to biometric templates tampering and stolen attacks, stolen smart card attack, privileged interior attack are fulfilled. The costs of storage requirement, computation, communication and storage are estimated. The results demonstrate that the proposed protocol is more efficient than Mukherjee et al., Chaudhary et al., and Gupta et al. protocols.

TI Quantum Image Compression: Fundamentals, Algorithms, and Advances
SO COMPUTERS
AB Quantum computing has emerged as a transformative paradigm, with revolutionary potential in numerous fields, including quantum image processing and compression. Applications that depend on large scale image data could benefit greatly from parallelism and quantum entanglement, which would allow images to be encoded and decoded with unprecedented efficiency and data reduction capability. This paper provides a comprehensive overview of the rapidly evolving field of quantum image compression, including its foundational principles, methods, challenges, and potential uses. The paper will also feature a thorough exploration of the fundamental concepts of quantum qubits as image pixels, quantum gates as image transformation tools, quantum image representation, as well as basic quantum compression operations. Our survey shows that work is still sparse on the practical implementation of quantum image compression algorithms on physical quantum computers. Thus, further research is needed in order to attain the full advantage and potential of quantum image compression algorithms on large-scale fault-tolerant quantum computers.

TI The unified effect of data encoding, ansatz expressibility and
   entanglement on the trainability of HQNNs
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PARALLEL EMERGENT AND DISTRIBUTED SYSTEMS
AB Recent advances in quantum computing and machine learning have brought about a promising intersection of these two fields, leading to the emergence of quantum machine learning (QML). However, the integration of quantum computing and machine learning poses several challenges. One of the prominent challenges lies in the presence of barren plateaus (BP) in QML algorithms, particularly in quantum neural networks (QNNs). Recent studies have successfully identified the fundamental causes underlying the existence of BP in QNNs. This paper presents a framework designed to explore the interplay of multiple factors contributing to the BP problem in quantum neural networks (QNNs), which poses a critical challenge for the practical applications of QML. We focus on the combined influence of data encoding, qubit entanglement, and ansatz expressibility in hybrid quantum neural networks (HQNNs) for multi-class classification tasks. Our framework aims to empirically analyze the joint impact of these factors on the training landscape of HQNNs. Our results show that the occurrence of the BP problem in HQNNs is contingent upon the expressibility of the underlying ansatz and the type of the adopted data encoding technique. Additionally, we observe that qubit entanglement also plays a role in exacerbating the BP problem. Leveraging various evaluation metrics for classification tasks, we systematically evaluate the performance of HQNNs and provide recommendations tailored to different constraint scenarios. Our findings emphasize the significance of our framework in addressing the practical success of QNNs.

TI Modeling Singlet Fission on a Quantum Computer

We use the Peeters-Devreese-Soldatov energyfunctional to calculate the necessary energetics based on the momentsof the Hamiltonian estimated on the quantum computer. To reduce thenumber of required measurements, we use several independent strategies:1) reduction of the size of the relevant Hilbert space by taperingoff qubits; 2) measurement optimization via rotations to eigenbasesshared by groups of qubit-wise commuting Pauli strings; and 3) parallelexecution of multiple state preparation and measurement operationsusing all 20 qubits available on the Quantinuum H1-1 quantum hardware.Our results meet the energetic requirements for singlet fission, arein excellent agreement with exact transition energies (for the chosenone-particle basis), and outperform classical methods considered computationallyfeasible for singlet fission candidates.

TI Spin Defects in hBN assisted by Metallic Nanotrenches for Quantum
   Sensing
SO NANO LETTERS
AB The omnipresence of hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) in devices embedding two-dimensional materials has prompted it as the most sought after platform to implement quantum sensing due to its testing while operating capability. The negatively charged boron vacancy (VB-) in hBN plays a prominent role, as it can be easily generated while its spin population can be initialized and read out by optical means at room-temperature. But the lower quantum yield hinders its widespread use as an integrated quantum sensor. Here, we demonstrate an emission enhancement amounting to 400 by nanotrench arrays compatible with coplanar waveguide (CPW) electrodes employed for spinstate detection. By monitoring the reflectance spectrum of the resonators as additional layers of hBN are transferred, we have optimized the overall hBN/nanotrench optical response, maximizing thereby the luminescence enhancement. Based on these finely tuned heterostructures, we achieved an enhanced DC magnetic field sensitivity as high as 6 x 10(-5) T/Hz(1/2).

TI Proposal for a nonadiabatic geometric gate with an Andreev spin qubit
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB We study a hybrid structure of a ferromagnetic insulator and a superconductor connected by a weak link, which accommodates Andreev bound states whose spin degeneracy is lifted due to the exchange interaction with the ferromagnet. The resultant spin-resolved energy levels realize a two-state quantum system, provided that a single electron is trapped in the bound state, i.e., an Andreev spin qubit. The qubit state can be manipulated by controlling the magnetization dynamics of the ferromagnet, which mediates the coupling between external fields and the qubit. In particular, our hybrid structure provides a simple platform to manipulate and control the spin qubit using spintronic techniques. By employing a modified Hahn spin echo protocol for the magnetization dynamics, we show that our Andreev spin qubit can realize a nonadiabatic geometric gate.

   two-qubit spin squeezing model
SO PHYSICA SCRIPTA
AB Quantum decoherence happens when the system interacts with the environment. Quantum correlation behaviours in the two-qubit spin squeezing model are studied under the influence of intrinsic decoherence. Quantitative results were determined, which depend on parameters of the physical system by checking different quantifiers of quantum correlation such as entanglement, local quantum uncertainty, trace distance discord and uncertainty-induced quantum nonlocality. We show that the entanglement suffers from intrinsic decoherence and exhibits sudden death, whereas the other measures are more robust against intrinsic decoherence. Further, we highlight the role of spin squeezing coupling constant and magnetic field.

Recently, from the deduction of the result MIP* = RE in quantum computation, it was obtained that Quantum Field Theory (QFT) allows for different forms of computation in quantum computers that Quantum Mechanics (QM) does not allow. Thus, there must exist forms of computation in the QFT representation of the Universe that the QM representation does not allow. We explain in a simple manner how the QFT representation allows for different forms of computation by describing the differences between QFT and QM, and obtain why the future of quantum computation will require the use of QFT.

TI Quantum simulation of molecules without fermionic encoding of the wave
   function
SO NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB Molecular simulations generally require fermionic encoding in which fermion statistics are encoded into the qubit representation of the wave function. Recent calculations suggest that fermionic encoding of the wave function can be bypassed, leading to more efficient quantum computations. Here we show that the two-electron reduced density matrix (2-RDM) can be expressed as a unique functional of the unencoded N-qubit-particle wave function without approximation, and hence, the energy can be expressed as a functional of the 2-RDM without fermionic encoding of the wave function. In contrast to current hardware-efficient methods, the derived functional has a unique, one-to-one (and onto) mapping between the qubit-particle wave functions and 2-RDMs, which avoids the over-parametrization that can lead to optimization difficulties such as barren plateaus. An application to computing the ground-state energy and 2-RDM of H-4 is presented.

TI NTRU_ SSS: Anew Method Signcryption Post Quantum Cryptography Based on
   Shamir's Secret Sharing
SO CMC-COMPUTERS MATERIALS & CONTINUA
AB With the advent of quantum computing, numerous efforts have been made to standardize post-quantum cryptosystems with the intention Shamir-Adelman (RSA). A modified version of the traditional N-Th Degree Truncated Polynomial Ring (NTRU) cryptosystem called NTRU Prime has been developed to reduce the attack surface. In this paper, the Signcryption scheme was proposed, and it is most efficient than others since it reduces the complexity and runs the time of the code execution, and at the same time, provides a better security degree since it ensures the integrity of the sent message, confidentiality of the data, forward secrecy when using refreshed parameters for each session. Unforgeability to prevent the man-in-the-middle attack from being active or passive, and non-repudiation when the sender can't deny the recently sent message. This study aims to create a novel NTRU cryptography algorithm system that takes advantage of the security features of curve fitting operations and the valuable characteristics of chaotic systems. The proposed algorithm combines the (NTRU Prime) and Shamir's Secret Sharing (SSS) features to improve the security of the NTRU encryption and key generation stages that rely on robust polynomial generation. Based on experimental results and a comparison of the time required for crucial exchange between NTRU-SSS and the original NTRU, this study shows a rise in complexity with a decrease in execution time in the case when compared to the original NTRU. It's encouraging to see signs that the suggested changes to the NTRU work to increase accuracy and efficiency.

TI Eavesdropping a quantum key distribution network using sequential
   quantum unsharp measurement attacks
SO EUROPEAN PHYSICAL JOURNAL PLUS
AB We investigate the possibility of eavesdropping on a quantum key distribution network by local sequential quantum unsharp measurement attacks by the eavesdropper. In particular, we consider a pure two-qubit state shared between two parties Alice and Bob, sharing quantum steerable correlations that form the one-sided device-independent quantum key distribution network. One qubit of the shared state is with Alice and the other one while going to Bob's place is intercepted by multiple sequential eavesdroppers who perform quantum unsharp measurement attacks thus gaining some positive key rate while preserving the quantum steerable correlations for Bob. In this way, Bob will also have a positive secret key rate although reduced. However, this reduction is not that sharp and can be perceived due to the decoherence and imperfection of the measurement devices. We found that there is a possibility of sequential eavesdropping even after setting a minimum threshold on the observed secure key rate by Alice and Bob. In the end, we show that an unbounded number of eavesdroppers can also get secret information in some specific scenario.

TI Dependency-Aware Compilation for Surface Code Quantum Architectures
SO PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACM ON PROGRAMMING LANGUAGES-PACMPL
AB Practical applications of quantum computing depend on fault-tolerant devices with error correction. Today, the most promising approach is a class of error-correcting codes called surface codes. We study the problem of compiling quantum circuits for quantum computers implementing surface codes. Optimal or near-optimal compilation is critical for both efficiency and correctness. The compilation problem requires (1) mapping circuit qubits to the device qubits and (2) routing execution paths between interacting qubits. We solve this problem efficiently and near-optimally with a novel algorithm that exploits the dependency structure of circuit operations to formulate discrete optimization problems that can be approximated via simulated annealing, a classic and simple algorithm. Our extensive evaluation shows that our approach is powerful and flexible for compiling realistic workloads.

However, an adversary equipped with a quantum computer can break a discrete-logarithm-based elliptic curve algorithm. Consequently, the user privacy in 5G is at stake against quantum attacks. In this paper, we study the incorporation of the post-quantum ciphers in the SUCI calculation both at the user equipment and at the core network, which involves the shared-key exchange and then using the resulting key for the ID encryption. We experiment on different hardware platforms to analyze the PQC key exchange and encryption using NIST-standardized CRYSTALS-Kyber (which is now called an ML-KEM after the standardization selection by NIST). Our analyses focus on the performances and compare the Kyber-based key exchange and encryption with the current (pre-quantum) elliptic curve Diffie-Hellman (ECDH). The performance analyses are critical because mobile networking involves resource-limited and battery-operating mobile devices. We measure and analyze not only the time and CPU-processing performances but also the energy and power performances. Our analyses show that Kyber-512 is the most efficient and even has better performance (i.e., faster computations and lower energy consumption) than ECDH.

TI Unconstrained binary models of the travelling salesman problem variants
   for quantum optimization
SO QUANTUM INFORMATION PROCESSING
AB Quantum computing is offering a novel perspective for solving combinatorial optimization problems. To fully explore the possibilities offered by quantum computers, the problems need to be formulated as unconstrained binary models, taking into account limitation and advantages of quantum devices. In this work, we provide a detailed analysis of the travelling salesman problem with time windows (TSPTW) in the context of solving it on a quantum computer. We introduce quadratic unconstrained binary optimization and higher-order binary optimization formulations of this problem. We demonstrate the advantages of edge-based and node-based formulations of the TSPTW problem. Additionally, we investigate the experimental realization of the presented methods on a quantum annealing device. The provided results pave the path for utilizing quantum computer for a variety of real-world tasks which can be cast in the form of travelling salesman problem with time windows.

TI Quantum state transfer on the complete bipartite graph
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICS A-MATHEMATICAL AND THEORETICAL
AB Previously it was shown that (almost) perfect state transfer can be achieved on the complete bipartite graph by a discrete-time coined quantum walk based algorithm when both the sender and receiver vertices are in the same partition of the graph and when the sender and receiver are in opposite partitions of the same size. By changing the coin operator, we analyze the state transfer problem and we show that it is still possible to achieve state transfer with high fidelity even when the sender and receiver are in different partitions with different sizes. Moreover, it is also possible to use an active switch approach using lackadaisical quantum walks where the marked vertex is switched between the sender and receiver during the algorithm.

TI Two-Emitter Multimode Cavity Quantum Electrodynamics in Thin-Film
   Silicon Carbide Photonics
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW X
AB Color centers are point defects in crystals that can provide an optical interface to a long-lived spin state for distributed quantum information processing applications. An outstanding challenge for color center quantum technologies is the integration of optically coherent emitters into scalable thin-film photonics, a prerequisite for large-scale photonics integration of color centers within a commercial foundry process. Here, we report on the integration of near-transform-limited silicon vacancy (VSi) defects into microdisk resonators fabricated in a CMOS-compatible 4H-silicon carbide-on-insulator platform. We demonstrate a single-emitter cooperativity of up to 0.8 as well as optical superradiance from a pair of color centers coupled to the same cavity mode. We investigate the effect of multimode interference on the photon scattering dynamics from this multiemitter cavity quantum electrodynamics system. These results are crucial for the development of quantum networks in silicon carbide and bridge the classical-quantum photonics gap by uniting optically coherent spin defects with wafer-scalable, state-of-the-art photonics.

SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB We present a scheme to generate a continuous variable (CV) multipartite entangled state using an array of plasmonic graphene waveguides that are activated by nonclassical driving microwave modes. Within this scheme, we can exploit the interaction of two light fields coupled to the same microwave mode in each waveguide to produce any type of multipartite Gaussian entangled state. A teleportation network is illustrated using the resultant CV multipartite entangled state. In particular, the proposed setup enables coherent state teleportation across remotely connected nodes with fidelity above a threshold limit of 2/3, providing secure quantum teleportation networking even in the presence of losses.

TI Approximate error correction scheme for three-dimensional surface codes
   based reinforcement learning
SO CHINESE PHYSICS B
AB Quantum error correction technology is an important method to eliminate errors during the operation of quantum computers. In order to solve the problem of influence of errors on physical qubits, we propose an approximate error correction scheme that performs dimension mapping operations on surface codes. This error correction scheme utilizes the topological properties of error correction codes to map the surface code dimension to three dimensions. Compared to previous error correction schemes, the present three-dimensional surface code exhibits good scalability due to its higher redundancy and more efficient error correction capabilities. By reducing the number of ancilla qubits required for error correction, this approach achieves savings in measurement space and reduces resource consumption costs. In order to improve the decoding efficiency and solve the problem of the correlation between the surface code stabilizer and the 3D space after dimension mapping, we employ a reinforcement learning (RL) decoder based on deep Q-learning, which enables faster identification of the optimal syndrome and achieves better thresholds through conditional optimization. Compared to the minimum weight perfect matching decoding, the threshold of the RL trained model reaches 0.78%, which is 56% higher and enables large-scale fault-tolerant quantum computation.

TI Exploring the FPGA and ASIC design space of belief propagation and
   ordered statistics decoders for quantum error correction codes
SO EPJ QUANTUM TECHNOLOGY
AB Belief propagation (BP) combined with ordered statistics decoding (OSD) provides a good balance between accuracy and complexity for many quantum error correction (QEC) codes, making it nearly universal. However, the complexity of OSD can limit real-time decoding, particularly for superconducting qubits, and the limits of classical hardware decoders have not been fully explored. Therefore, it is important to assess the architecture of OSD for different code families, such as surface codes and bicycle bivariate codes, under realistic assumptions like the detector error model. This paper introduces a BP + OSD parallel architecture implemented on FPGA and ASIC for surface codes (distances 3-21) and bicycle bivariate codes (distances 6-24). Results show that for surface codes up to distance 9, the OSD post-processor fits into a single VCU129 FPGA, achieving a frequency of 200 MHz with a worst-case latency of 134 mu s. For bicycle bivariate codes, the limit is distance 12, with a frequency of 244 MHz and a worst-case latency of 84 mu s. In ASIC, with 45 nm technology, latency improves by 31%, but area resources grow significantly, making parallel implementation beyond distance 12 impractical on a single chip. The designs were verified using a hardware emulator, ensuring that the decoder's behavior matches software simulations and revealing interesting results like potential error floors at low logical error rates.

TI Quantum Inspired Universal Analog Computation Based on Circuits
SO ADVANCED QUANTUM TECHNOLOGIES
AB Universal quantum computation that consists of producing arbitrary input states and executing universal unitary gates is an important goal for the future information field. However, realizing a device that performs practical universal quantum computation is tricky. This is because it requires a scalable qubit system with long coherence time and good controls, which is harsh for most current platforms. Here, we provide a novel scheme to emulate the universal quantum computer by designing a classical circuit network. In the circuit network, we encode information using correlated electrical signals. The information processing elements that correspond to the universal quantum gate set are designed and embedded into the circuit network, which gives the classical circuit networks processing functions similar to that of universal quantum computation. Taking the analogy of two-qubit processor as an example, we experimentally verify that our proposal works well. Because classical circuit networks possess good scalability and stability, the present scheme is expected to avoid some problems faced by the quantum schemes. Thus, our findings are advantageous for information processing in the era of big data.

TI Noiseless attack and counterfactual security of quantum key distribution
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Counterfactual quantum key distribution (QKD) enables two parties to share a secret key using an interaction-free measurement. Here, we point out that the efficiency of counterfactual QKD protocols can be enhanced by including noncounterfactual bits. This inclusion potentially gives rise to the possibility of noiseless attacks, in which Eve can gain knowledge of the key bits without introducing any errors in the quantum channel. We show how this problem can be resolved in a simple way that naturally leads to the idea of "counterfactual security," whereby the noncounterfactual key bits are indicated to be secure by counterfactual detections. This method of enhancing the key rate is shown to be applicable to various existing quantum counterfactual key distribution protocols, increasing their efficiency without weakening their security.

TI Key issues review: useful autonomous quantum machines
SO REPORTS ON PROGRESS IN PHYSICS
AB Controlled quantum machines have matured significantly. A natural next step is to increasingly grant them autonomy, freeing them from time-dependent external control. For example, autonomy could pare down the classical control wires that heat and decohere quantum circuits; and an autonomous quantum refrigerator recently reset a superconducting qubit to near its ground state, as is necessary before a computation. Which fundamental conditions are necessary for realizing useful autonomous quantum machines? Inspired by recent quantum thermodynamics and chemistry, we posit conditions analogous to DiVincenzo's criteria for quantum computing. Furthermore, we illustrate the criteria with multiple autonomous quantum machines (refrigerators, circuits, clocks, etc) and multiple candidate platforms (neutral atoms, molecules, superconducting qubits, etc). Our criteria are intended to foment and guide the development of useful autonomous quantum machines.

In this work, we report an algorithmic framework based on nested Monte Carlo tree search coupled with the combinatorial multiarmed bandit model for the automated design of quantum circuits. Through numerical experiments, we demonstrate our algorithm applied to various kinds of problems, including the ground energy problem in quantum chemistry, quantum optimization on a graph, solving systems of linear equations, and finding encoding circuits for quantum error detection codes. Compared to the existing approaches, the results indicate that our circuit design algorithm can explore larger search spaces and optimize quantum circuits for larger systems, showing both versatility and scalability.

AB Quantum-augmented networks aim to use quantum phenomena to improve detection and protection against malicious actors in a classical communication network. This may include multiplexing quantum signals into classical fiber optical channels and incorporating purely quantum links alongside classical links in the network. In such hybrid networks, quantum protocols based on single photons become a bottleneck for transmission distances and data speeds, thereby reducing entire network performance. Furthermore, many of the security assumptions of the single-photon protocols do not hold up in practice because of the impossibility of manufacturing single-photon emitters.
   Multi-photon quantum protocols, on the other hand, are designed to operate under practical assumptions and do not require single photon emitters. As a result, they provide higher levels of security guarantees and longer transmission distances. However, the effect of channel and device noise on multiphoton protocols in terms of security, transmission distances, and bit rates has not been investigated. In this paper, we focus on channel noise and present our observations on the effect of various types of noise on multi-photon protocols. We also investigate the effect of topologies such as ring, star, and torus on the noise characteristics of the multi-photon protocols. Our results show the possible advantages of switching to multi-photon protocols and give insights into the repeater placement and topology choice for quantum-augmented networks.

TI Laserless quantum gates for electric dipoles in thermal motion

AB Internal states of polar molecules can be controlled by microwave-frequency electric dipole transitions. If the applied microwave electric field has a spatial gradient, these transitions also affect the motion of these dipolar particles. This capability can be used to engineer phonon-mediated quantum gates between, e.g., trapped polar molecular ion qubits without laser illumination and without the need for cooling near the motional ground state. The result is a high-speed quantum processing toolbox for dipoles in thermal motion that combines the precision microwave control of solid-state qubits with the long coherence times of trapped ion qubits.

TI Programmable Photonic Quantum Circuits with Ultrafast Time-Bin Encoding
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB We propose a quantum information processing platform that utilizes the ultrafast time-bin encoding of photons. This approach offers a pathway to scalability by leveraging the inherent phase stability of collinear temporal interferometric networks at the femtosecond-to-picosecond timescale. The proposed architecture encodes information in ultrafast temporal bins processed using optically induced nonlinearities and birefringent materials while keeping photons in a single spatial mode. We demonstrate the potential for scalable photonic quantum information processing through two independent experiments that showcase the platform's programmability and scalability, respectively. The scheme's programmability is demonstrated in the first experiment, where we successfully program 362 different unitary transformations in up to eight dimensions in a temporal circuit. In the second experiment, we show the scalability of ultrafast time-bin encoding by building a passive optical network, with increasing circuit depth, of up to 36 optical modes. In each experiment, fidelities exceed 97%, while the interferometric phase remains passively stable for several days.

TI A probabilistic quantum algorithm for imaginary-time evolution based on
   Taylor expansion
SO EPJ QUANTUM TECHNOLOGY
AB Imaginary-time evolution is a powerful tool for obtaining the ground state of a quantum system, but the complexity of classical algorithms designed for simulating imaginary-time evolution will increase significantly as the size of the quantum system becomes larger. Here, a probabilistic quantum algorithm based on Taylor expansion for implementing imaginary-time evolution is introduced. For Hamiltonians composed of Pauli product terms, the quantum circuit requires only a single ancillary qubit and is exclusively constructed using elementary single-qubit and two-qubit gates. Furthermore, similar principles are used to extend the algorithm to the case where the Hamiltonian takes a more general form. The algorithm only requires negligible precomputed numerical calculations, without the need for complex classical pre-mathematical calculations or optimization loops. We demonstrate the algorithm by solving the ground state energy of hydrogen molecules and Heisenberg Hamiltonians. Moreover, we conducted experiments on real quantum computers through the quantum cloud platform to find the ground state energy of Heisenberg Hamiltonians. Our work extends the methods for realizing imaginary-time evolution on quantum computers, and our algorithm exhibits potential for implementation on near-term quantum devices, particularly when the Hamiltonian consists of Pauli product terms.

TI QAL-BP: an augmented Lagrangian quantum approach for bin packing
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB The bin packing is a well-known NP-Hard problem in the domain of artificial intelligence, posing significant challenges in finding efficient solutions. Conversely, recent advancements in quantum technologies have shown promising potential for achieving substantial computational speedup, particularly in certain problem classes, such as combinatorial optimization. In this study, we introduce QAL-BP, a novel Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) formulation designed specifically for bin packing and suitable for quantum computation. QAL-BP utilizes the Augmented Lagrangian method to incorporate the bin packing constraints into the objective function while also facilitating an analytical estimation of heuristic, but empirically robust, penalty multipliers. This approach leads to a more versatile and generalizable model that eliminates the need for empirically calculating instance-dependent Lagrangian coefficients, a requirement commonly encountered in alternative QUBO formulations for similar problems. To assess the effectiveness of our proposed approach, we conduct experiments on a set of bin packing instances using a real Quantum Annealing device. Additionally, we compare the results with those obtained from two different classical solvers, namely simulated annealing and Gurobi. The experimental findings not only confirm the correctness of the proposed formulation, but also demonstrate the potential of quantum computation in effectively solving the bin packing problem, particularly as more reliable quantum technology becomes available.

TI Quantum Key Distribution Using a Quantum Emitter in Hexagonal Boron
   Nitride
SO ADVANCED QUANTUM TECHNOLOGIES
AB Quantum key distribution (QKD) is considered the most immediate application to be widely implemented among a variety of potential quantum technologies. QKD enables sharing secret keys between distant users by using photons as information carriers. An ongoing endeavor is to implement these protocols in practice in a robust, and compact manner so as to be efficiently deployable in a range of real-world scenarios. Single photon sources (SPS) in solid-state materials are prime candidates in this respect. This article demonstrates a room temperature, discrete-variable quantum key distribution system using a bright single photon source in hexagonal-boron nitride, operating in free-space. Employing an easily interchangeable photon source system, keys with one million bits length, and a secret key of approximately 70000 bits, at a quantum bit error rate of 6%, with & epsilon;-security of 10(-10) are generated. This study demonstrates the first proof of concept finite-key BB84 QKD system realized with hBN defects.

TI Perturbation theory under the truncated Wigner approximation: How
   system-environment entanglement formation drives quantum decoherence
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB In discrete quantum systems, quantum decoherence is the disappearance of simple phase relations as a result of interactions with an environment. For many applications, the question is not necessarily how to avoid (inevitable) system-environment interactions, but rather how to design environments that optimally preserve a system's phase relations in spite of such interactions. The formation of system-environment entanglement is a major driving mechanism for decoherence, and a detailed understanding of this process could inform strategies for conserving coherence optimally. This requires scalable, flexible, and systematically improvable quantum dynamical methods that retain detailed information about the entanglement properties of the environment, yet very few current methods offer this combination of features. Here we address this need by introducing a theoretical framework wherein we combine the truncated Wigner approximation with standard time-dependent perturbation theory, allowing for computing expectation values of operators in the combined system-environment Hilbert space. We demonstrate the utility of this framework by applying it to the spin-boson model, representative of qubits and simple donor-acceptor systems. For this model, our framework provides an analytical description of perturbative contributions to expectation values. We monitor how quantum decoherence at zero temperature is accompanied by entanglement formation with individual environmental degrees of freedom. Based on this entanglement behavior, we find that the selective suppression of low-frequency environmental modes is particularly effective for mitigating quantum decoherence.

TI Investigating an amplitude amplification-based optimization algorithm
   for model predictive control
SO DIGITAL CHEMICAL ENGINEERING
AB The potential for greater algorithmic efficiency for some problems on quantum computers compared to classical computers is appealing in many fields including, for example, the process systems engineering field. While quantum algorithms have been studied for a variety of applications related to optimization, molecular modeling, and machine learning, there remain many applications in process systems engineering, including process control, where it is not clear how quantum computing algorithms would be beneficial. One idea for attempting to understand when a quantum algorithm might provide benefits for control is to start with algorithms that would be expected to benefit "similar" problems (e.g., optimization problems) and to see if controllers can be implemented within those algorithmic frameworks. Therefore, in this work, we study the use of a quantum computing algorithm related to Grover's algorithm, which is an amplitude amplification strategy that can search an unordered list with improved efficiency compared to a classical algorithm for the task. It has been extended to perform a search for optimal paths over a graph. Given its potential utility for search and optimization, this is an example of an algorithm where we might wonder if it could be adjusted or used to provide speed-ups for large control problems if the controller could function within this algorithmic framework. This work provides the first steps toward attempting to address this question by investigating how optimization-based control problems would fit into this framework. A process described by �=�+� is considered as a test case. The modified Grover's algorithm requires the optimization problem to be mapped into quantum gates. We discuss ideas for attempting to represent an optimization-based controller known as model predictive control (MPC) in the modified Grover's algorithm framework. We test how various parameters of the control and quantum algorithm designs, including fundamental parameters in MPC such as the number of sampling periods and length of the sampling periods, impact the success of using the quantum algorithm for the MPC. We provide analyses regarding why the results are what they are to give perspective on how quantum computing algorithms work and intersect with engineering problems.

TI Quantum Many-Body Jarzynski Equality and Dissipative Noise on a Digital
   Quantum Computer
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW X
AB The quantum Jarzynski equality and the Crooks relation are fundamental laws connecting equilibrium processes with nonequilibrium fluctuations. They are promising tools to benchmark quantum devices and measure free energy differences. While they are well established theoretically and also experimental realizations for few-body systems already exist, their experimental validity in the quantum many-body regime has not been observed so far. Here, we present results for nonequilibrium protocols in systems with up to 16 interacting degrees of freedom obtained on trapped ion and superconducting qubit quantum computers, which test the quantum Jarzynski equality and the Crooks relation in the many-body regime. To achieve this, we overcome present-day limitations in the preparation of thermal ensembles and in the measurement of work distributions on noisy intermediate-scale quantum devices. We discuss the accuracy to which the Jarzynski equality holds on different quantum computing platforms subject to platformspecific errors. The analysis reveals the validity of Jarzynski's equality in a regime with energy dissipation, compensated for by a fast unitary drive. This provides new insights for analyzing errors in many-body quantum simulators.

TI Quantum simulation of quantum phase transitions using the convex
   geometry of reduced density matrices
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Transitions of many-particle quantum systems between distinct phases at absolute-zero temperature, known as quantum phase transitions, require an exacting treatment of particle correlations. In this work, we present a general quantum-computing approach to quantum phase transitions that exploits the geometric structure of reduced density matrices. While typical approaches to quantum phase transitions examine discontinuities in the order parameters, the origin of phase transitions???their order parameters and symmetry breaking???can be understood geometrically in terms of the set of two-particle reduced density matrices (2-RDMs). The convex set of 2-RDMs provides a comprehensive map of the quantum system including its distinct phases as well as the transitions connecting these phases. Because 2-RDMs can potentially be computed on quantum computers at nonexponential cost, even when the quantum system is strongly correlated, they are ideally suited for a quantum -computing approach to quantum phase transitions. We compute the convex set of 2-RDMs for a Lipkin-Meshkov-Glick spin model on IBM superconducting-qubit quantum processors. Even though computations are limited to few-particle models due to device noise, comparisons with a classically solvable 1000-particle model reveal that the finite-particle quantum solutions capture the key features of the phase transitions including the strong correlation and the symmetry breaking.

TI Tantalum airbridges for scalable superconducting quantum processors
SO NPJ QUANTUM INFORMATION
AB The unique property of tantalum, particularly its exceptional resistance to both acid and alkali, makes it promising for superconducting quantum processors. Here, we propose a novel lift-off method for fabricating tantalum airbridges with separate or fully-capped structures. This method introduces an aluminum film as a barrier layer to separate two layers of photoresist, which is then etched away before depositing tantalum film. We experimentally characterize these tantalum airbridges as control line jumpers, ground plane crossovers and coupling elements, and further validate the overall adaptability by a 13-qubit quantum processor with a median T1 exceeding 100 mu s. The median single-qubit gate fidelity is measured at 99.95(2)% for isolated Randomized Benchmarking and 99.94(2)% for the simultaneous one. Additionally, the experimental achievement of airbridge coupling with a controlled-Z gate fidelity surpassing 99.2(2)% in a separate two-qubit quantum chip may facilitate scalable quantum computation and quantum error correction with entirely tantalum elements.

This survey explores lattice-based digital signatures, a promising post-quantum resistant alternative to traditional schemes relying on factoring or discrete logarithm problems, which face increasing risks from quantum computing. The study covers conventional paradigms like Hash-and-Sign and Fiat-Shamir, as well as specialized applications including group, ring, blind, and proxy signatures. It analyzes the versatility and security strengths of lattice-based schemes, providing practical insights. Each chapter summarizes advancements in schemes, identifying emerging trends. We also pinpoint future directions to deploy lattice-based digital signatures including quantum cryptography.

TI QFaaS: A serverless function-as-a-service framework for quantum
   computing
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PHARMACEUTICS
AB Quantum computing is rapidly reaching a point in which its application design and engineering aspects must beseriously considered. However, quantum software engineering is still in its infancy, with numerous challenges,especially in dealing with the diversity of quantum programming languages and noisy intermediate-scalequantum (NISQ) systems. To alleviate these challenges, we propose QFaaS, a holisticQuantumFunction-as-a-Service framework, which leverages the advantages of the serverless model, DevOps lifecycle, and thestate-of-the-art software techniques to advance practical quantum computing for next-generation applicationdevelopment in the NISQ era. Our framework provides essential elements of a serverless quantum systemto streamline service-oriented quantum application development in cloud environments, such as combininghybrid quantum-classical computation, automating the backend selection, cold start mitigation, and adaptingDevOps techniques. QFaaS offers a full-stack and unified quantum serverless platform by integrating multiplewell-known quantum software development kits (Qiskit, Q#, Cirq, and Braket), quantum simulators, and cloudproviders (IBM Quantum and Amazon Braket). This paper proposes the concept of quantum function-as-a-service, system design, operation workflows, implementation of QFaaS, and lessons learned on the benefitsand limitations of quantum serverless computing. We also present practical use cases with various quantumapplications on today's quantum computers and simulators to demonstrate our framework capability tofacilitate the ongoing quantum software transition.

TI The effect of quantum decoherence on inflationary gravitational waves
SO JOURNAL OF COSMOLOGY AND ASTROPARTICLE PHYSICS
AB The theory of inflation provides a mechanism to explain the structures we observe today in the Universe, starting from quantum-mechanically generated fluctuations. However, this leaves the question of: how did the quantum-to-classical transition, occur? During inflation, tensor perturbations interact (at least gravitationally) with other fields, meaning that we need to view these perturbations as an open system that interacts with an environment. In this paper, the evolution of the system is described using a Lindblad equation, which describes the quantum decoherence of the system. This is a possible mechanism for explaining the quantum-to-classical transition. We show that this quantum decoherence during a de Sitter phase leads to a scale-dependent increase of the gravitational wave power spectrum, depending on the strength and time dependence of the interaction between the system and the environment. By using current upper bounds on the gravitational wave power spectrum from inflation, obtained from CMB and the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA constraints, we find an upper bound on the interaction strength. Furthermore, we compute the decoherence criterion, which indicates the minimal interaction strength needed for a specific scale to have successfully decohered by the end of inflation. Assuming that the CMB modes have completely decohered, we indicate a lower bound on the interaction strength. In addition, this decoherence criterion allows us to look at which scales might not have fully decohered and could still show some relic quantum signatures. Lastly, we use sensitivity forecasts to study how future gravitational-wave detectors, such as LISA and ET, could constrain the decoherence parameter space. Due to the scale-dependence of the power spectrum, LISA could only have a very small impact. However, ET will be able to significantly improve our current constraints for specific decoherence scenarios.

TI Accelerating feedback-based quantum algorithms through time rescaling
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB This work investigates the impact of time rescaling on the performance of Feedback-Based Quantum Algorithms (FQAs) and their variant for optimization tasks, Feedback-Based Algorithm for Quantum Optimization (FALQON). We introduce the Time-Rescaled Feedback-Based Quantum Algorithm (TR-FQA) and TimeRescaled Feedback-Based Algorithm for Quantum Optimization (TR-FALQON), time-rescaled versions of FQA and FALQON, respectively. The method is applied to two representative problems: the MaxCut combinatorial optimization problem and ground-state preparation in the axial next-nearest neighbor Ising (ANNNI) model. The results show that TR-FALQON accelerates convergence toward the optimal solution in the circuit's early layers and outperforms the standard version in low-depth regimes. In the context of state preparation, TR-FQA requires fewer layers than the original algorithm. These findings suggest that time rescaling can reduce the number of layers needed to reach a high-quality solution, even if the exact ground state is not obtained.

AB Noise is the greatest obstacle in quantum metrology that limits it achievable precision and sensitivity. There are many techniques to mitigate the effect of noise, but this can never be done completely. One commonly proposed technique is to repeatedly apply quantum error correction. Unfortunately, the required repetition frequency needed to recover the Heisenberg limit is unachievable with the existing quantum technologies. In this article we explore the discrete application of quantum error correction with current technological limitations in mind. We establish that quantum error correction can be beneficial and highlight the factors which need to be improved so one can reliably reach the Heisenberg limit level precision.

TI A simulator of optical coherent-state evolution in quantum key
   distribution systems
SO OPTICAL AND QUANTUM ELECTRONICS
AB Quantum key distribution (QKD) is believed to represent a viable solution to achieve theoretically unconditionally secure key generation. However, the available optical systems for experimental QKD, based on photon transmission, are flawed by non-idealities that ultimately limit the achievable performance. Classical simulation of the optical hardware employed in these systems may take on a determining role in engineering future QKD networks. In this article, attempts for developing a QKD simulator based on low-computational-cost models of the employed hardware are presented. In particular, the simulation infrastructure targets polarization-based QKD setups with faint laser sources, whose behaviour can be described by semiclassical coherent states and Mean Photon Number (MPN) per beam. The effects of passive optical components on the photonic qubit evolution are described by Jones matrices, whose coefficients, for some commercial devices, are stored in an ad-hoc library. Realistic eavesdropping attacks and non-idealities, such as optical losses, fibre attenuation, polarization misalignment and limited efficiency of single-photon detectors, are also taken into account. The infrastructure allows the user to describe the desired QKD configuration and it provides in output the MPN at the receiver and two fiducial performance parameters: Quantum Bit Error Rate (QBER) and secure key rate. The comparison of the simulation results with experimental data in the state-of-the-art literature highlights that this work is a step forward towards the definition of compact models for the hardware-dependent simulation of quantum-assisted communication networks.

TI Tetrahedron genuine entanglement measure of four-qubit systems
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICS A-MATHEMATICAL AND THEORETICAL
AB Quantifying genuine entanglement is a key task in quantum information theory. We study the quantification of genuine multipartite entanglement for four-qubit systems. Based on the concurrence of nine different classes of four-qubit states, with each class being closed under stochastic local operation and classical communication, we construct a concurrence tetrahedron. Proper genuine four-qubit entanglement measure is presented by using the volume of the concurrence tetrahedron. For non genuine entangled pure states, the four-qubit entanglement measure classifies the bi-separable entanglement. We show that the concurrence tetrahedron based measure of genuine four-qubit entanglement is not equivalent to the genuine four-partite entanglement concurrence. We illustrate the advantages of the concurrence tetrahedron by detailed examples.

TI Software mitigation of coherent two-qubit gate errors
SO QUANTUM SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB Two-qubit gates are important components of quantum computing. However, unwanted interactions between qubits (so-called parasitic gates) can be particularly problematic and degrade the performance of quantum applications. In this work, we present two software methods to mitigate parasitic two-qubit gate errors. The first approach is built upon the Cartan's KAK decomposition and keeps the original unitary decomposition for the error-free native two-qubit gate. It counteracts a parasitic two-qubit gate by only applying single-qubit rotations and therefore has no two-qubit gate overhead. We show the optimal choice of single-qubit mitigation gates. The second approach applies a numerical optimisation algorithm to re-compile a target unitary into the error-parasitic two-qubit gate plus single-qubit gates. We demonstrate these approaches on the CPhase-parasitic iSWAP-like gates. The KAK-based approach helps decrease unitary infidelity by a factor of 3 compared to the noisy implementation without error mitigation. When arbitrary single-qubit rotations are allowed, recompilation could completely mitigate the effect of parasitic errors but may require more native gates than the KAK-based approach. We also compare their average gate fidelity under realistic noise models, including relaxation and depolarising errors. Numerical results suggest that different approaches are advantageous in different error regimes, providing error mitigation guidance for near-term quantum computers.

TI A Cryo-CMOS Oscillator With an Automatic Common-Mode Resonance
   Calibration for Quantum Computing Applications
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON CIRCUITS AND SYSTEMS I-REGULAR PAPERS
AB This article presents a 4-to-5 GHz LC oscillator operating at 4.2K for quantum computing applications. The phase noise (PN) specification of the oscillator is derived based on the control fidelity for a single-qubit operation. To reveal the substantial gap between the theoretical predictions and measurement results at cryogenic temperatures, a new PN expression for an oscillator is derived by considering the shot-noise effect. To reach the optimum performance of an LC oscillator, a common-mode (CM) resonance technique is implemented. Additionally, this work presents a digital calibration loop to adjust the CM frequency automatically at 4.2K, reducing the oscillator's PN and thus improving the control fidelity. The calibration technique reduces the flicker corner of the oscillator over a wide temperature range (10 x and 8 x reduction at 300K and 4.2K, respectively). At 4.2K, our 0.15-mm(2) oscillator consumes a 5-mW power and achieves a PN of -153.8dBc/Hz at a 10MHz offset, corresponding to a 200-dB FOM. The calibration circuits consume only a 0.4-mW power and 0.01-mm(2) area.

TI Out-of-Distribution Generalization for Learning Quantum Channels with
   Low-Energy Coherent States
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB When experimentally learning the action of a continuous-variable quantum process by probing it with inputs, there will often be some restriction on the input states used. One experimentally simple way to probe a quantum channel is to use low-energy coherent states. Learning a quantum channel in this way presents difficulties, due to the fact that two channels may act similarly on low-energy inputs but very differently for high-energy inputs. They may also act similarly on coherent-state inputs but differently on nonclassical inputs. Extrapolating the behavior of a channel for more general input states from its action on the far more limited set of low-energy coherent states is a case of out-of-distribution generalization. To be sure that such generalization gives meaningful results, one needs to relate error bounds for the training set to bounds that are valid for all inputs. We show that for any pair of channels that act sufficiently similarly on low-energy coherent-state inputs, one can bound how different the input-output relations are for any (high-energy or highly nonclassical) input. This proves that out-of-distribution generalization is always possible for learning quantum channels using low-energy coherent states, as long as enough samples are used.

TI Satellite-Based Communication for Phase-Matching
   Measurement-Device-Independent Quantum Key Distribution
SO ANNALEN DER PHYSIK
AB This study investigates the feasibility of the phase-matching measurement-device-independent quantum key distribution (PM-MDI QKD) protocol proposed by Lin and L & uuml;tkenhaus for satellite-based quantum communication. The protocol's key rate, known to exceed the repeaterless PLOB bound, is evaluated in the asymptotic limit under noisy conditions typical of satellite communications, including loss-only scenarios. The setup involves two ground-based parties connected via fiber (loss-only or noisy) and a space-based third party linked to one of these two ground-based parties through free-space communication. Simulations using the elliptic-beam approximation model the average key rate (AKR) and its probability distribution (PDR) across varying zenith angles and fiber distances. Down-link free-space communication is assessed under day and night conditions, with intensity optimization for each graphical point. Dynamic configurations of satellite and ground stations are also considered. Results indicate that AKR decays more slowly under loss-only conditions, while PDR analysis shows higher key rates produce more concentrated distributions. These findings demonstrate the potential of PM-MDI QKD protocols for achieving reliable key rates in satellite-based quantum communication.

TI Iteration-free digital quantum simulation of imaginary-time evolution
   based on the approximate unitary expansion
SO EPL
AB Imaginary-time evolution plays an important role in many areas of quantum physics and has been widely applied to the ground-state determination of various Hamiltonian in the quantum computation field. In this work, we propose an iteration-free quantum algorithm in a full gate-based frame using the approximate unitary expansion to simulate the imaginary-time evolution operator, avoiding the resource overhead caused by repeated measurement for state reconstruction or complex pre-calculations in the classical computers. We detail the algorithm and analyze the complexity and related characteristics including a lower bound for ancillary qubits at a given success probability. Then an application demonstration of the algorithm in quantum chemistry with hydrogen molecule under noiseless and noisy conditions is offered. In addition, we present another imaginary-time evolution simulation method based on similar construction schemes. Our algorithms can serve as the alternative proposals for the imaginary-time evolution realization in the future fault-tolerant quantum computers. Copyright (C) 2023 EPLA

TI Sharing entanglement of the Werner state by arbitrarily many independent
   observers
SO ACTA PHYSICA SINICA
AB The problem of sharing quantum correlations is an interesting problem in the study of quantum information theory. Silva et al. proposed the study of sharing quantum nonlocality at first. They studied the fundamental limits on nonlocality, asking whether a single pair of entangled qubits could generate a long sequence of nonlocal correlations. At the same time, the sequential scenario was also introduced first, in which Alice and Bob each have half of a pair of entangled qubit states. The first Bob measures his half and then passes his part to a second Bob who measures again and so on. Obviously, even partial preservation of entanglement in a shared state in spite of a few sequences of local operations performed by the sharing parties can be important for information processing schemes in which entanglement is utilized as a resource. Thus, the problem of sharing quantum entanglement has also been extensively investigated. Recently, Srivastava et al. proved that there exist a class of T-states whose entanglement can be shared by arbitrarily many independent observers in [Phys. Rev. A 2022 105 062413]. Here, we want to find whether there are other entangled states that can be shared entanglement arbitrarily many times. In this paper, we consider the problem of sharing quantum entanglement when the initial shared state is a two-qubit entangled Werner state. The goal is to maximize the number of Bobs that can share entanglement with a single Alice. By suitably choosing the entanglement witness operator and the unsharp measurement settings by the Bobs, we prove that there exist two-qubit entangled initial shared Werner states whose entanglement can be detected by arbitrarily many sequential observers Bobs with a single Alice. Then, we also consider the special case of the Werner state, that is, the maximally entangled state as the initial shared state. In this case, its entanglement can also be witnessed arbitrarily many times, and the number of Bobs increases with the decrease of parameter.

TI Topological entanglement stabilization in superconducting quantum
   circuits
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Topological properties of quantum systems are among the most intriguing emerging phenomena in condensed matter physics. A crucial property of topological systems is the symmetry-protected robustness towards local noise. Experiments have demonstrated topological phases of matter in various quantum systems. However, using the robustness of such modes to stabilize quantum correlations is still a highly sought-after milestone. In this work, we put forward a concept of using topological modes to stabilize fully entangled quantum states, and we demonstrate the stability of the entanglement with respect to parameter fluctuations. Specifically, we see that entanglement remains stable against parameter fluctuations in the topologically nontrivial regime, while entanglement in the trivial regime is highly susceptible to local noise. We supplement our scheme with an experimentally realistic and detailed proposal based on coupled superconducting resonators and qubits. Our proposal sets an approach for generating long-lived quantum modes with robustness towards disorder in the circuit parameters via a bottom-up experimental approach relying on easy-to-engineer building blocks.

TI Wide-Spectrum Security of Quantum Key Distribution
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB Implementations of quantum key distribution (QKD) need vulnerability assessment against loopholes in their optical scheme. Most of the optical attacks involve injecting or receiving extraneous light via the communication channel. An eavesdropper can choose her attack wavelengths arbitrarily within the quantum channel passband to maximize the attack performance, exploiting spectral transparency windows of system components. Here we propose a wide-spectrum security evaluation methodology to achieve full optical spectrum safety for QKD systems. This technique requires transmittance characterization in a wide spectral band with a high sensitivity. We report a testbench that characterizes insertion loss of fiberoptic components in a wide spectral range of 400-2300 nm and up to 70 dB dynamic range. To illustrate practical application of the proposed methodology, we give a full Trojan-horse attack analysis for some typical QKD system configurations and discuss briefly induced-photorefraction and detector-backflash attacks. Our methodology can be used for certification of QKD systems.

TI Quantum non-Markovianity of a qubit in presence of state dependent bath
SO PHYSICA SCRIPTA
AB In the field of quantum information theory, the intersection of the complex dynamics related to non-Markovianity and information is a crucial frontier. Non-Markovian effects, which take memory and temporal correlations into account, challenge conventional wisdom in the fields of quantum biology, metrology, cryptography, and communication. In this work, we analyze the non-Markovian dynamics of a dephasing model in presence of initial system-bath (SB) correlations. These SB correlations are generated via projective measurements on a predefined equilibrium state. Using the non-Markovian measures based on trace distance and quantum Fisher information, it is shown that these correlations have significant impact in the non-Markovian regime at high temperatures while it does not play any role in the Markovian case. Furthermore, it is shown that the oscillatory behaviour of the decoherence function does not always show non-Markovian behaviour.

TI Low-depth random Clifford circuits for quantum coding against Pauli
   noise using a tensor-network decoder
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Recent work [M. J. Gullans et al., Phys. Rev. X 11, 031066 (2021)] has shown that quantum error correcting codes defined by random Clifford encoding circuits can achieve a nonzero encoding rate in correcting errors even if the random circuits on n qubits, embedded in one spatial dimension (1D), have a logarithmic depth d = O(log n). However, this was demonstrated only for a simple erasure noise model. In this work, we discover that, for the same class of codes, this desired property indeed holds for the conventional Pauli noise model. Specifically, we numerically demonstrate that the hashing bound, i.e., a rate known to be achieved with d = O(n)-depth random encoding circuits, can be attained for the above codes even when the circuit depth is restricted to d = O(log n) in 1D for depolarizing noise of various strengths. This analysis is made possible with our development of a tensor-network maximum-likelihood decoding algorithm that works efficiently for log-depth encoding circuits in 1D.

TI Towards practical quantum computers: transmon qubit with a lifetime
   approaching 0.5 milliseconds
SO NPJ QUANTUM INFORMATION
AB Here we report a breakthrough in the fabrication of a long lifetime transmon qubit. We use tantalum films as the base superconductor. By using a dry etching process, we obtained transmon qubits with a best T-1 lifetime of 503 mu s. As a comparison, we also fabricated transmon qubits with other popular materials, including niobium and aluminum, under the same design and fabrication processes. After characterizing their coherence properties, we found that qubits prepared with tantalum films have the best performance. Since the dry etching process is stable and highly anisotropic, it is much more suitable for fabricating complex scalable quantum circuits, when compared to wet etching. As a result, the current breakthrough indicates that the dry etching process of tantalum film is a promising approach to fabricate medium- or large-scale superconducting quantum circuits with a much longer lifetime, meeting the requirements for building practical quantum computers.

TI Peer-to-Peer Distribution of Graph States Across Spacetime Quantum
   Networks of Arbitrary Topology
SO PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACM ON MEASUREMENT AND ANALYSIS OF COMPUTING SYSTEMS
AB Graph states are a class of important multiparty entangled quantum states, of which Bell pairs are the special case. Realizing a robust and fast distribution of arbitrary graph states in the downstream layer of the quantum network is essential for enabling large-scale quantum networks. To address this, we propose a novel quantum network protocol, called P2PGSD, inspired by the classical Peer-to-Peer network. This protocol efficiently implements general graph state distribution in the network layer, demonstrating significant advantages in resource efficiency and scalability, particularly for sparse graph states. An explicit mathematical model for the general graph state distribution problem has also been constructed, above which the intractability for a wide class of resource minimization problems is proved and the optimality of the existing algorithms is discussed. Moreover, we leverage the space-time quantum network for memory management in network challenges, drawing inspiration from special relativity. We suggest a universal quantum distributed computation framework to exploit the strengths of our protocols, as confirmed by numerical simulations that reveal up to a 50% enhancement for general sparse graph states. This work marks a significant step toward resource-efficient multiparty entanglement distribution for diverse network topologies.

TI Integrating Machine Learning and Quantum Circuits for Proton Affinity
   Predictions
SO JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL THEORY AND COMPUTATION
AB A key step in interpreting gas-phase ion mobility coupled with mass spectrometry (IM-MS) data for unknown structure prediction involves identifying the most favorable protonated structure. In the gas phase, the site of protonation is determined using proton affinity (PA) measurements. Currently, mass spectrometry and ab initio computation methods are widely used to evaluate PA; however, both methods are resource-intensive and time-consuming. Therefore, there is a critical need for efficient methods to estimate PA, enabling the rapid identification of the most favorable protonation site in complex organic molecules with multiple proton binding sites. In this work, we developed a fast and accurate method for PA prediction by using multiple descriptors in combination with machine learning (ML) models. Using a comprehensive set of 186 descriptors, our model demonstrated strong predictive performance, with an R 2 of 0.96 and a MAE of 2.47 kcal/mol, comparable to experimental uncertainty. Furthermore, we designed quantum circuits as feature encoders for a classical neural network. To evaluate the effectiveness of this hybrid quantum-classical model, we compared its performance with traditional ML models using a reduced feature set derived from the full set. A correlation analysis showed that the quantum-encoded representations have a stronger positive correlation with the target values than the original features do. As a result, the hybrid model outperformed its classical counterpart and achieved consistent performance comparable to traditional ML models with the same reduced feature set on both a noiseless simulator and real quantum hardware, highlighting the potential of quantum machine learning for accurate and efficient PA predictions.

TI Boosted Bell-state measurements for photonic quantum computation
SO NPJ QUANTUM INFORMATION
AB Fault-tolerant fusion-based photonic quantum computing (FBQC) greatly relies on entangling two-photon measurements, called fusions. These fusions can be realized using linear-optical projective Bell-state measurements (BSMs). These linear-optical BSMs are limited to a success probability of 50%, greatly reducing the performance of FBQC schemes. The performance of FBQC can be improved using boosting, thus achieving higher success probabilities by adding additional resources. Here, we realize a boosted BSM using a 4 x 4 multiport splitter and an additional entangled photon pair, allowing for a success probability of up to 75%. In our experiment, we obtain a success probability for our boosted BSM of (69.3 +/- 0.3)%, clearly exceeding the 50% limit. We further demonstrate the significance of our boosted BSM for FBQC, showing a threefold increase in robustness to photon loss and a significant reduction of the logical error rates.

TI Nanophotonic quantum sensing with engineered spin-optic coupling
SO NANOPHOTONICS
AB Nitrogen vacancy centers in diamond provide a spin-based qubit system with long coherence time even at room temperature, making them suitable ambient-condition quantum sensors for quantities including electromagnetic fields, temperature, and rotation. The optically addressable level structures of NV spins allow transduction of spin information onto light-field intensity. The sub-optimal readout fidelity of conventional fluorescence measurement remains a significant drawback for room-temperature ensemble sensing. Here, we discuss nanophotonic interfaces that provide opportunities to achieve near-unity readout fidelity based on IR absorption via resonantly enhanced spin-optic coupling. Spin-coupled resonant nanophotonic devices are projected to particularly benefit applications that utilize micro- to nanoscale sensing volume and to outperform present methods in their volume-normalized sensitivity.

TI Security of practical modulator-free quantum key distribution
SO NPJ QUANTUM INFORMATION
AB Recent advancements in quantum key distribution have led to the development of various modulator-free transmitters. Among their advantages, they offer enhanced security against Trojan-horse attacks. However, practical implementations emit residual pulses that, while not used in the quantum communication, still carry information about Alice's state preparation process. While the intensity of these pulses is typically attenuated, the extinction ratio of practical intensity modulators is always finite, and therefore it remains crucial to account for the residual information leakage at the security-proof level. In this work, we prove the security of these transmitters in such setting and evaluate their performance. We find that the secret-key rate of the protocol is severely affected when the information leakage is not sufficiently small, which highlights the importance of taking into account this imperfection.

TI The physical origin of a photon-number parity effect in cavity quantum
   electrodynamics
SO RESULTS IN PHYSICS
AB The rapidly increasing capability to modulate the physicochemical properties of atomic groups and molecules by means of their coupling to radiation, as well as the revolutionary potential of quantum computing for materials simulation and prediction, fuel the interest for non-classical phenomena produced by atom-radiation interaction in confined space. One of such phenomena is a "parity effect" that arises in the dynamics of an atom coupled to two degenerate cavity field modes by two-photon processes and manifests itself as a strong dependence of the field dynamics on the parity of the initial number of photons. Here we identify the physical origin of this effect in the quantum correlations that produce entanglement among the system components, explaining why the system evolution depends critically on the parity of the total number of photons. Understanding the physical underpinnings of the effect also allows us to characterize it within the framework of quantum information theory and to generalize it. Since a single photon addition/removal has dramatic effects on the system behavior, this effect may be usefully applied, also for amplification purposes, to optoelectronics and quantum information processing.

TI Fast coherent splitting of Bose-Einstein condensates
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Preparation of nontrivial quantum states without introducing unwanted excitations or decoherence remains a central challenge in utilizing ultracold atomic systems for quantum simulation. We employ optimal control methods to realize fast, coherent splitting of a one-dimensional Bose-Einstein condensate, achieving negligible classical excitations while preserving quantum correlations. Furthermore, we explore two-step protocols in which controlled classical motion is first induced and subsequently suppressed via tailored control sequences. Our experiments highlight the potential of optimal control for quantum state engineering and dynamical control in many-body quantum systems.

AB The Micius satellite is the pioneering initiative to demonstrate quantum teleportation, entanglement distribution, quantum key distribution (QKD), and quantum -secured communications experiments at the global scale. In this work, we report on the results of the 600 -mm -aperture ground station design which has enabled the establishment of a quantum -secured link between the Zvenigorod and Nanshan ground stations using the Micius satellite. As a result of a quantum communications session, an overall sifted key of 2.5 Mbits and a total final key length of 310 kbits have been obtained. We present an extension of the security analysis of the realization of satellitebased QKD decoy -state protocol by taking into account the effect of the detection -efficiency mismatch for four detectors. We also simulate the QKD protocol for the satellite passage and by that validate our semi -empirical model for a realistic receiver, which is in good agreement with the experimental data. Our results pave the way to the considerations of realistic imperfection of the QKD systems, which are important in the context of their practical security.

TI Quantum State Ordering Driven by Quantum Battery Capacity and
   Correlation
SO ADVANCED QUANTUM TECHNOLOGIES
AB The rapid advancements in quantum information science and quantum thermodynamics have led to increasingly interdisciplinary innovations. One notable development is the concept of the ergotropic gap, defined as the difference between global and local ergotropy. Building on this foundation, multipartite ergotropic gap indicators have been proposed to enhance methods of entanglement classification [Phys. Rev. A 109, 062427 (2024)]. Motivated by this perspective, the thermodynamic notion of quantum battery capacity-closely related to ergotropy and defined as the energy difference between maximally and minimally achievable states under unitary evolution-is examined to address state ordering problems. The investigation focuses on comparing state orderings using three measures: battery capacity, entanglement of formation, and quantum discord, with particular emphasis on two-qubit Bell-diagonal states. Remarkably, certain classes of these states exhibit identical ordering patterns across all three measures under specific conditions.

TI Two-Photon Interference of Single Photons from Dissimilar Sources
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW APPLIED
AB Entanglement swapping and heralding are at the heart of many protocols for distributed quantum information. For photons, this typically involves Bell-state measurements based on two-photon interference effects. In this context, hybrid systems that combine high rate, ultrastable, and pure quantum sources with long-lived quantum memories are particularly interesting. Here, we develop a theoretical description of pulsed two-photon interference of photons from dissimilar sources to predict the outcomes of second-order cross-correlation measurements. These are directly related to, and hence used to quantify, photon indistinguishability. We study their dependence on critical system parameters such as quantum state lifetime and emission frequency, and quantify the impact of time jitter, pure dephasing, and spectral wandering. We show that for a fixed lifetime of one of the two emitters, for each frequency detuning there is an optimal lifetime of the second emitter that leads to the highest photon indistinguishability. Expectations for different hybrid combinations involving III-V semiconductor quantum dots, color centers in diamond, atom-scale defects in two-dimensional materials and neutral atoms are quantitatively compared for realworld system parameters. Our work provides a theoretical basis for the treatment of dissimilar emitters and enables assessment of which imperfections can be tolerated in hybrid photonic quantum networks.

In this paper, we compare the performance of two diabatic protocols in a realistic, dissipative setting using the maximum weighted independent set problem as a test case, showing that the potential advantages of diabatic protocols are strongly reduced in the presence of dissipation. Our results highlight the importance of evaluating quantum annealing strategies under practical conditions.

At the quantum level, the corresponding quantum operators of the conserved quantities provide two oscillator representations from which we derive two Boson Fock spaces. Using the normalized coherent states which are the minimum uncertainty states on noncommutative configuration space isomorphic to each of the boson Fock space, we form entangled coherent states which are Bell- like states labeled quasi-Bell states. The effect of non-maximality of a quasi-Bell state based quantum channel is investigated in the context of a teleportation of a qubit.

TI Optimal implementation of two-qubit linear-optical quantum filters
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB We design optimal interferometric schemes for the implementation of two-qubit linear-optical quantum filters diagonal in the computational basis. The filtering is realized by the interference of the two photons encoding the qubits in a multiport linear-optical interferometer, followed by conditioning on presence of a single photon in each output port of the filter. The filter thus operates in the coincidence basis, similarly to many linear-optical unitary quantum gates. The implementation of a filter with linear optics may require an additional overhead in terms of a reduced overall success probability of the filtering and the optimal filters are those that maximize the overall success probability. We discuss in detail the case of symmetric real filters and extend our analysis also to asymmetric and complex filters.

TI Cloud computing-based framework for heart disease classification using
   quantum machine learning approach
SO JOURNAL OF INTELLIGENT SYSTEMS
AB Accurate early identification and treatment of cardiovascular diseases can prevent heart failure problems and reduce mortality rates. This study aims to use quantum learning to predict heart problems to increase the accuracy of traditional prediction and classification methods. Machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) techniques need quantum learning to quickly and accurately analyze massive volumes of complex data. With quantum computing, the suggested DL and ML algorithms can change their predictions on the basis of changes in the dataset. This approach could help with the early and accurate detection of chronic diseases. The Cleveland heart disease dataset is undergoing preliminary processing to validate missing values to increase the precision rate and prevent incorrect forecasts. This study examined the feasibility of employing and deploying a quantum ML (QML) framework via cloud computing to categorize cardiac conditions. The research was divided into four sections. First, the principal component analysis was used to preprocess the Cleveland dataset, recursive feature elimination was used to select features, and min-max normalization was used to give the dataset a high-dimensional value. Second, we compared traditional classifiers, such as support vector machine (SVM) and artificial neural network, with the quantum approach to verify the quantum approach's efficiency. Third, we examined two unique QML classification methods: quantum neural networks (QNNs) and quantum SVM (QSVM). Fourth, bagging-QSVM was developed and deployed as an ensemble learning model. Experimental results using the QNN show an accuracy of 77%, a precision of 76%, a recall of 73%, and an F1 score of 75%. With an accuracy of 85%, a precision of 79%, a recall of 90%, and an F1-score of 84%, the QSVM method demonstrated a much better performance than the QNN. Particularly, the Bagging_QSVM model exhibited an outstanding performance, with a flawless score of 100% across all critical performance measures. The study shows that the bagging method for ensemble learning is a solid way of increasing the accuracy of quantum method predictions.

TI Deployed quantum link characterization via Bayesian ancilla-assisted
   process tomography
SO OPTICS LETTERS
AB The development of large-scale quantum networks requires reliable quantum channels, the quality of which can be quantified by the framework of quantum process tomography. In this work, we leverage ancilla-assisted process tomography (AAPT) and Bayesian inference to probe a 1.6 km deployed fiber-optic link. We send one of the two polarization-entangled photons at Alice in one building to Bob in another, exploiting the local qubit as an ancilla system to characterize the corresponding quantum channel. Monitoring over a 24 h period returns a steady process fidelity of 97.6(1)%, while controllable spectral filtering with passbands from 0.025 to 4.38 THz finds fidelities that first increase, and then level off with bandwidth, suggesting both stable operation with time and minimal polarization mode dispersion. To our knowledge, these results represent the first AAPT of a deployed quantum link, revealing a valuable tool for in situ analysis of entanglement-based quantum networks.

AB In recent years, quantum computing shows significant potentials in many areas. In this proceeding, we revisit the observation of the Zc(3900) resonance with quantum machine learning techniques, specifically quantum support vector machine (QSVM). Meanwhile, the outcomes are compared with classical support vector machine (SVM) method. With the IBM Qiskit toolkit, the QSVM method achieves a competitive signal and background classification accuracy compared to classical methods. This study emphasizes the potential of quantum machine learning in high-energy physics research, and it reveals the feasibility of applying quantum computing in future physics data analysis.

TI Robust Self-Testing of Four-Qubit Symmetric States
SO ENTROPY
AB Quantum verification has been highlighted as a significant challenge on the road to scalable technology, especially with the rapid development of quantum computing. To verify quantum states, self-testing is proposed as a device-independent concept, which is based only on the observed statistics. Previous studies focused on bipartite states and some multipartite states, including all symmetric states, but only in the case of three qubits. In this paper, we first give a criterion for the self-testing of a four-qubit symmetric state with a special structure and the robustness analysis based on vector norm inequalities. Then we generalize the idea to a family of parameterized four-qubit symmetric states through projections onto two subsystems.

TI Quantum Low-Density Parity-Check Codes for Modular Architectures
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB In efforts to scale the size of quantum computers, modularity plays a central role across most quantum computing technologies. In the light of fault tolerance, this necessitates designing quantum error-correcting codes that are compatible with the connectivity arising from the architectural layouts. In this paper, we aim to bridge this gap by giving a novel way to view and construct quantum low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes tailored for modular architectures. We demonstrate that if the intra-and intermodular qubit connectivity can be viewed as corresponding to some classical or quantum LDPC codes then their hypergraph product code fully respects the architectural connectivity constraints. Finally, we show that relaxed connectivity constraints that allow twists of connections between modules pave a way to construct codes with better parameters.

TI Controlling Remote Robots Based on Zidan's Quantum Computing Model
SO CMC-COMPUTERS MATERIALS & CONTINUA
AB In this paper, we propose a novel algorithm based on Zidan's quantum computing model for remotely controlling the direction of a quantum-controlledmobile robot equipped with n-movements. The proposed algorithm is based on the measurement of concurrence value for the different movements of the robot. Consider a faraway robot that moves in the deep space (e.g., moves toward a galaxy), and it is required to control the direction of this robot from a ground station by some person Alice. She sends an unknown qubit alpha vertical bar 0 > + beta vertical bar 1 > via the teleportation protocol to the robot. Then, the proposed algorithm decodes the received unknown qubit into an angle., that determines the motion direction of the robot, based on the concurrence value. The proposed algorithm has been tested for four and eight movements. Two simulators have been tested; IBM Quantum composer and IBM's system, The two simulators achieved the same result approximately. The motion of any part of the robot is considered, if it has a pre-existing sensor system and a locomotive system,. We can use this technique in many places like in space robots (16 directions). The results show that the proposed technique can be easily used for a huge number of movements. However, increasing the number of movements of the robot will increase the number of qubits.

TI Performance-Optimized Components for Quantum Technologies via Additive
   Manufacturing
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB Novel quantum technologies and devices place unprecedented demands on the performance of experimental components, while their widespread deployment beyond the laboratory necessitates increased robustness and fast affordable production. We show how the use of additive manufacturing, together with mathematical optimization techniques and innovative designs, allows the production of compact lightweight components with greatly enhanced performance. We use such components to produce a magneto-optical trap that captures approximately 2 x 10(8) rubidium atoms, employing for this purpose a compact and highly stable device for spectroscopy and optical power distribution, optimized neodymium magnet arrays for magnetic field generation, and a lightweight additively manufactured ultrahigh-vacuum chamber. We show how the use of additive manufacturing enables substantial weight reduction and stability enhancement, while also illustrating the transferability of our approach to experiments and devices across the quantum technology sector and beyond.

TI Phononic bath engineering of a superconducting qubit
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Phonons, the ubiquitous quanta of vibrational energy, play a vital role in the performance of quantum technologies. Conversely, unintended coupling to phonons degrades qubit performance and can lead to correlated errors in superconducting qubit systems. Regardless of whether phonons play an enabling or deleterious role, they do not typically admit control over their spectral properties, nor the possibility of engineering their dissipation to be used as a resource. Here we show that coupling a superconducting qubit to a bath of piezoelectric surface acoustic wave phonons enables a novel platform for investigating open quantum systems. By shaping the loss spectrum of the qubit via the bath of lossy surface phonons, we demonstrate preparation and dynamical stabilization of superposition states through the combined effects of drive and dissipation. These experiments highlight the versatility of engineered phononic dissipation and advance the understanding of mechanical losses in superconducting qubit systems.
   Hybrid quantum acoustic systems integrating qubits with phonons offer a novel platform for investigating open quantum systems. Kitzman et al. report control of superposition states of a transmon qubit under the effect of drive and dissipation by engineering its coupling to a bath of surface acoustic wave phonons.

TI Compact Second-Harmonic Generation in the C-Exciton Band of
   3R-MoS2 for Integrated Quantum Photonics
SO ACS PHOTONICS
AB We present a novel scheme for highly efficient second-harmonic generation in the visible spectrum using minimal volumes of 3R-phase molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) integrated on a silicon nitride (Si3N4) ridge waveguide. The device is designed to operate near the C-exciton resonance of MoS2, where the material exhibits its strongest second-order nonlinear response. A periodic array of nanometric MoS2 stripes is patterned on the waveguide surface to form a one-dimensional photonic crystal, enabling strong field localization at the pump wavelength (lambda FF approximate to 890 nm) near the photonic band edge. This leads to resonant second-harmonic emission around 445 nm, close to the highly absorbing C-exciton. To mitigate the absorption while maintaining phase matching, we implement a counter-propagating pump configuration that ensures zero in-plane momentum mismatch and enables vertical out-coupling of the second harmonic signal via a leaky-mode resonance. The combination of strong nonlinear susceptibility, mode engineering, and resonant coupling allows for efficient frequency conversion within an interaction region only tens of nanometers thick, with an overall device footprint on the order of 1 mu m2. Full-wave 3D simulations predict conversion efficiencies up to 0.004% at peak pump intensities of 300 MW/cm2. Moreover, the same architecture is compatible with spontaneous parametric down-conversion (SPDC), enabling integrated photon-pair generation with intrinsic modal and directional filtering. These features make the platform well-suited for compact, scalable nonlinear, and quantum photonic applications in the visible and near-infrared range.

TI Simulating Quantum Field Theories on Gate-Based Quantum Computers
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON QUANTUM ENGINEERING
AB We implement a simulation of a quantum field theory in 1+1 space-time dimensions on a gate-based quantum computer using the light-front formulation of the theory. The nonperturbative simulation of the Yukawa model field theory is verified on IBM's simulator and is also demonstrated on a small-scale IBM circuit-based quantum processor, on the cloud, using IBM Qiskit. The light-front formulation allows for controlling the resource requirement and complexity of the computation with commensurate tradeoffs in accuracy and detail by modulating a single parameter, namely, the harmonic resolution. Qubit operators for the Bosonic excitations were also created and were used along with the Fermionic ones already available, to simulate the theory involving all of these particles. With the restriction on the number of logical qubits available on the existent gate-based noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices, the Trotterization approximation is also used. We show that experimentally relevant quantities, such as cross sections for various processes and survival probabilities of various states, can be computed. We also explore the inaccuracies introduced by the bounds on achievable harmonic resolution and Trotter steps placed by the limited number of qubits and circuit depth supported by present-day NISQ devices.

TI Characterizing nonlocal correlations through various n-locality
   inequalities in a quantum network
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB The multipartite quantum networks feature multiple independent sources, in contrast to the conventional multipartite Bell experiment involving a single source. Despite the initial independence of resources, the multiple observers in the network can suitably choose measurements on their local subsystems and generate a form of quantum nonlocality across the network. So far, network nonlocality has been explored when each source produces a two-qubit entangled state. In this work we demonstrate the network nonlocality when each party performs a black-box measurement, and the dimension of the system remains unspecified. In an interesting work, by considering each source produces two-qubit entangled states in the conventional bilocal scenario, Gisin et al. [Phys. Rev. A 96, 020304 (2017)] demonstrated a correspondence between the violations of bipartite Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Halt inequality and the bilocality inequality. We introduce a variant of the sum-of-squares approach to reproduce their results without assuming the dimension of the system. We then generalize the argument for network nonlocality in star-network topology. Furthermore, we propose a set of n-locality inequalities in a star-network configuration where each of the n parties performs an arbitrary number of dichotomic measurements and demonstrates the above correspondence between the quantum violations of the n-locality inequalities and the chained Bell inequalities. A similar correspondence is demonstrated based on a recently formulated family of n-locality inequalities whose optimal quantum violation cannot be obtained when each source emits a two-qubit entangled state and requires multiple copies of two-qubit entangled states. Throughout this paper, each party in the network performs black-box measurements, and the dimension of the system remains unspecified.

TI DWDM-Based Effective Group Velocity Dispersion Module for Long-Distance
   Quantum Communication
SO JOURNAL OF LIGHTWAVE TECHNOLOGY
AB Quantum states of light can be used to encode quantum information, and it can be transmitted over free-space or optical fibers for long-distance quantum communication. Since quantum signals or qubits cannot be amplified, long-distance quantum communication often requires pre-conditioning or preparation of the quantum states for a specific group velocity dispersion (GVD) of the desired fiber-optic channel, which is often difficult experimentally. Moreover, in entanglement-based quantum communication, GVD can be used as another degree of freedom to certify an entanglement signature. However, introducing and controlling large GVD with minimal loss is a challenging problem. In this work, we demonstrate a fiber-optic module capable of introducing a desired amount of GVD to the quantum signal and verify its operation using an entangled photon pair at the telecom wavelength. Our GVD module is based on dense wavelength-division multiplexing (DWDM) technology, and it can be easily designed and operated for various quantum communication scenarios, making it a valuable tool in implementing long-distance quantum communication in varying real-world conditions.

TI ILP-based resource optimization realized by quantum annealing for
   optical wide-area communication networks-A framework for solving
   combinatorial problems of a real-world application by quantum annealing
SO FRONTIERS IN COMPUTER SCIENCE
AB Resource allocation of wide-area internet networks is inherently a combinatorial optimization problem that if solved quickly, could provide near real-time adaptive control of internet-protocol traffic ensuring increased network efficacy and robustness, while minimizing energy requirements coming from power-hungry transceivers. In recent works we demonstrated how such a problem could be cast as a quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO) problem that can be embedded onto the D-Wave Advantage (TM) quantum annealer system, demonstrating proof of principle. Our initial studies left open the possibility for improvement of D-Wave solutions via judicious choices of system run parameters. Here we report on our investigations for optimizing these system parameters, and how we incorporate machine learning (ML) techniques to further improve on the quality of solutions. In particular, we use the Hamming distance to investigate correlations between various system-run parameters and solution vectors. We then apply a decision tree neural network (NN) to learn these correlations, with the goal of using the neural network to provide further guesses to solution vectors. We successfully implement this NN in a simple integer linear programming (ILP) example, demonstrating how the NN can fully map out the solution space that was not captured by D-Wave. We find, however, for the 3-node network problem the NN is not able to enhance the quality of space of solutions.

AB Realization of qubit gate sequences require coherent microwave control pulses with programmable amplitude, duration, spacing and phase. We propose an SRAM based arbitrary waveform generator for cryogenic control of spin qubits. We demonstrate in this work, the cryogenic operation of a fully programmable radio frequency arbitrary waveform generator in 14 nm FinFET technology. The waveform sequence from a control processor can be stored in an SRAM memory array, which can be programmed in real time. The waveform pattern is converted to microwave pulses by a source-series-terminated digital to analog converter. The chip is operational at 4 K, capable of generating an arbitrary envelope shape at the desired carrier frequency. Total power consumption of the AWG is 40-140 mW at 4 K, depending upon the baud rate. A wide signal band of 1-17 GHz is measured at 4 K, while multiple qubit control can be achieved using frequency division multiplexing at an average spurious free dynamic range of 40 dB. This work paves the way to optimal qubit control and closed loop feedback control, which is necessary to achieve low latency error mitigation and correction in future quantum computing systems.

TI Two-Dimensional Si Spin Qubit Arrays with Multilevel Interconnects
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB The promise of quantum computation is contingent upon physical qubits with both a low gate error rate and broad scalability. Silicon-based spins are a leading qubit platform but demonstrations to date have not utilized fabrication processes capable of extending arrays in two dimensions while maintaining complete control of individual spins. Here, we implement an interconnect process, common in semiconductor manufacturing, with multiple back-end-of-line layers, to show an extendable two-dimensional array of spins with fully controllable nearest-neighbor exchange interactions. In a device using three interconnect layers, we encode exchange-only qubits and achieve average single-qubit gate fidelities consistent with singlelayer devices, including fidelities greater than 99.9%, as measured by blind randomized benchmarking. Moreover, with spin connectivity in two dimensions, we show that both linear and right-angle exchangeonly qubits with high performance can be formed, enabling qubit array reconfigurability in the presence of defects. This extendable device platform demonstrates that industrial manufacturing techniques can be leveraged for scalable spin qubit technologies.

TI Scalable Noise Characterization of Syndrome-Extraction Circuits with
   Averaged Circuit Eigenvalue Sampling
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB Characterizing the performance of noisy quantum circuits is central to the production of prototype quantum computers and can enable improved quantum error correction that exploits noise biases identified in a quantum device. We develop a scalable noise-characterization protocol suited to characterizing the syndrome-extraction circuits of quantum error-correcting codes, a key component of fault-tolerant architectures. Our protocol builds upon averaged circuit eigenvalue sampling (ACES), a framework for noise-characterization experiments that simultaneously estimates the Pauli-error probabilities of all gates in a Clifford circuit and captures averaged spatial correlations between gates implemented simultaneously in the layers of the circuit. By rigorously analyzing the performance of noise-characterization experiments in the ACES framework, we derive a figure of merit for their expected performance, allowing us to optimize their experimental design and improve the precision to which we estimate noise given fixed experimental resources. We demonstrate the scalability and performance of our protocol through circuit-level numerical simulations of the entire noise-characterization procedure for the syndromeextraction circuit of a distance-25 surface code with over 1000 qubits. Our results indicate that detailed noise-characterization methods are scalable to near-term quantum devices.

TI Beyond quantum annealing: optimal control solutions to maxcut problems
SO QUANTUM SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB Quantum Annealing (QA) relies on mixing two Hamiltonian terms, a simple driver and a complex problem Hamiltonian, in a linear combination. The time-dependent schedule for this mixing is often taken to be linear in time: improving on this linear choice is known to be essential and has proven to be difficult. Here, we present different techniques for improving on the linear-schedule QA along two directions, conceptually distinct but leading to similar outcomes: 1) the first approach consists of constructing a Trotter-digitized QA (dQA) with schedules parameterized in terms of Fourier modes or Chebyshev polynomials, inspired by the Chopped Random Basis algorithm for optimal control in continuous time; 2) the second approach is technically a Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA), whose solutions are found iteratively using linear interpolation or expansion in Fourier modes. Both approaches emphasize finding smooth optimal schedule parameters, ultimately leading to hybrid quantum-classical variational algorithms of the alternating Hamiltonian Ansatz type. We apply these techniques to MaxCut problems on weighted 3-regular graphs with N = 14 sites, focusing on hard instances that exhibit a small spectral gap, for which a standard linear-schedule QA performs poorly. We characterize the physics behind the optimal protocols for both the dQA and QAOA approaches, discovering shortcuts to adiabaticity-like dynamics. Furthermore, we study the transferability of such smooth solutions among hard instances of MaxCut at different circuit depths. Finally, we show that the smoothness pattern of these protocols obtained in a digital setting enables us to adapt them to continuous-time evolution, contrarily to generic non-smooth solutions. This procedure results in an optimized QA schedule that is implementable on analog devices.

TI Quantum Frequency Combs with Path Identity for Quantum Remote Sensing
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW X
AB Quantum sensing promises to revolutionize sensing applications by employing quantum states of light or matter as sensing probes. Photons are the clear choice as quantum probes for remote sensing because they can travel to and interact with a distant target. Existing schemes are mainly based on the quantum illumination framework, which requires quantum memory to store a single photon of an initially entangled pair until its twin reflects off a target and returns for final correlation measurements. Existing demonstrations are limited to tabletop experiments, and expanding the sensing range faces various roadblocks, including long-time quantum storage and photon loss and noise when transmitting quantum signals over long distances. We propose a novel quantum sensing framework that addresses these challenges using quantum frequency combs with path identity for remote sensing of signatures ("qCOMBPASS"). The combination of one key quantum phenomenon and two quantum resources- namely, quantum-induced coherence by path identity, quantum frequency combs, and two-mode squeezed light-allows for quantum remote sensing without requiring quantum memory. The proposed scheme is akin to a quantum radar based on entangled frequency-comb pairs that uses path identity to detect, range, or sense a remote target of interest by measuring pulses of one comb in the pair that never traveled to the target but that contains target information "teleported" by quantum-induced coherence by path identity from the other comb in the pair that traveled to the target but is not detected. We develop the basic qCOMBPASS theory, analyze the properties of the qCOMBPASS transceiver, and introduce the qCOMBPASS equation-a quantum analog of the well-known LIDAR equation in classical remote sensing. We also describe an experimental scheme to demonstrate the concept using two-mode squeezed quantum combs. qCOMBPASS can strongly impact various applications in remote quantum sensing, imaging, metrology, and communications. These applications include detection and ranging of low-reflectivity objects, measurement of small displacements of a remote target with precision beyond the standard quantum limit (SQL), standoff hyperspectral quantum imaging, discreet surveillance from space with low detection probability (detect synchronization, and networks of distributed quantum sensors.

TI Quantum ensemble learning with a programmable superconducting processor
SO NPJ QUANTUM INFORMATION
AB Quantum machine learning is among the most exciting potential applications of quantum computing. However, the vulnerability of quantum information to environmental noises and the consequent high cost for realizing fault tolerance has impeded the quantum models from learning complex datasets. Here, we introduce AdaBoost.Q, a quantum adaptation of the classical adaptive boosting (AdaBoost) algorithm designed to enhance learning capabilities of quantum classifiers. Based on the probabilistic nature of quantum measurement, the algorithm improves the prediction accuracy by refining the attention mechanism during the adaptive training and combination of quantum classifiers. We experimentally demonstrate the versatility of our approach on a programmable superconducting processor, where we observe notable performance enhancements across various quantum machine learning models, including quantum neural networks and quantum convolutional neural networks. With AdaBoost.Q, we achieve an accuracy above 86% for a ten-class classification task over 10,000 test samples, and an accuracy of 100% for a quantum feature recognition task over 1564 test samples. Our results demonstrate a foundational tool for advancing quantum machine learning towards practical applications, which has broad applicability to both the current noisy and the future fault-tolerant quantum devices.

TI A self-referenced optical phase noise analyzer for quantum technologies
SO REVIEW OF SCIENTIFIC INSTRUMENTS
AB Second generation quantum technologies aim to outperform classical alternatives by utilizing engineered quantum systems. Maintaining the coherence required to enable any quantum advantage requires detailed knowledge and control over the noise that the hosting system is subjected to. Characterizing noise processes via their power spectral density is routinely done throughout science and technology and can be a demanding task. Determining the phase noise power spectrum in leading quantum technology platforms, for example, can be either outside the reach of many phase noise analyzers or prohibitively expensive. In this work, we present and characterize a low-complexity, low-cost optical phase noise analyzer based on the short-delay optical self-heterodyne measurements for quantum technology applications. Using this setup, we compare two approximate to 1 Hz linewidth ultra-stable oscillators near 729 nm. Their measurements are used as a baseline to determine and discuss the noise floor achieved in this measurement apparatus with a focus on limitations and their tradeoffs. The achieved noise floor in this all-stock-component implementation of an optical phase noise analyzer compares favorably with commercial offerings. This setup can be used particularly without a more stable reference or operational quantum system as a sensor as would be the case for many component manufacturers.

TI Dynamical decoupling protection for three-level systems
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB In addition to the traditional two-level system, the three-level system serves as another important elemental building block for the manipulation of qubits. However, the quantum information processing in the three-level system is also subject to the decoherence induced by the interaction between the quantum system and its environment or by the crosstalk between different qutrits. In this work, we construct a sequence of physically feasible dynamical decoupling operators for the three-level system to mitigate not only the transverse dephasing between the excited state and ground states, but also the longitudinal relaxation among them. Combining the Hamiltonian engineering and our constructed dynamical decoupling sequence, we further realize the dynamical decoupling protection of qutrit-based quantum gates. Our scheme can effectively enhance the fidelity of three-level-based quantum gates through filtering out the environmental noises, which may provide a new horizon to improve the accuracy of three-level-based quantum manipulation.

AB Nondeterministic choice is a useful program construct that provides a way to describe the behaviour of a program without specifying the details of possible implementations. It supports the stepwise refinement of programs, a method that has proven useful in software development. Nondeterminism has also been introduced in quantum programming, and termination of nondeterministic quantum programs has been extensively analysed. In this paper, we go beyond termination analysis to investigate the verification of no-deterministic quantum programs where properties are given by sets of hermitian operators on the associated Hilbert space. Hoare-type logic systems for partial and total correctness are proposed which turn out to be both sound and relatively complete with respect to their corresponding semantic correctness. To show the utility of these proof systems, we analyse some quantum algorithms such as quantum error correction scheme, Deutsch algorithm, and a nondeterministic quantum walk. Finally, a proof assistant prototype is implemented to aid in the automated reasoning of nondeterministic quantum programs.

TI Quantum anomaly detection in the latent space of proton collision events
   at the LHC
SO COMMUNICATIONS PHYSICS
AB The ongoing quest to discover new phenomena at the LHC necessitates the continuous development of algorithms and technologies. Established approaches like machine learning, along with emerging technologies such as quantum computing show promise in the enhancement of experimental capabilities. In this work, we propose a strategy for anomaly detection tasks at the LHC based on unsupervised quantum machine learning, and demonstrate its effectiveness in identifying new phenomena. The designed quantum models-an unsupervised kernel machine and two clustering algorithms-are trained to detect new-physics events using a latent representation of LHC data, generated by an autoencoder designed to accommodate current quantum hardware limitations on problem size. For kernel-based anomaly detection, we implement an instance of the model on a quantum computer, and we identify a regime where it significantly outperforms its classical counterparts. We show that the observed performance enhancement is related to the quantum resources utilised by the model.

We consider a ladder as well as a two-dimensional grid of plaquettes, detailing the use of gauge fixing to reduce the degrees of freedom and simplify the Hamiltonian. We demonstrate how system dynamics, ground states, and energy gaps can be computed using the continuous-variable approach to quantum computing. Our results indicate that it is feasible to study non-Abelian gauge theories with continuous variables, providing new avenues for understanding the real-time dynamics of quantum field theories.

TI Optimizing the information extracted by a single qubit measurement
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB We consider a quantum computation that only extracts one bit of information per N-qubit quantum state preparation. This is relevant for error mitigation schemes where the remainder of the system is measured to detect errors. We optimize the estimation of the expectation value of an operator by its linear decomposition into bitwise-measurable terms. We prove that optimal decompositions must be in terms of reflections with eigenvalues & PLUSMN;1. We find the optimal reflection decomposition of a fast-forwardable operator, and show a numerical improvement over a simple Pauli decomposition by a factor N0.7.

TI Discovering quantum circuit components with program synthesis
SO MACHINE LEARNING-SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB Despite rapid progress in the field, it is still challenging to discover new ways to leverage quantum computation: all quantum algorithms must be designed by hand, and quantum mechanics is notoriously counterintuitive. In this paper, we study how artificial intelligence, in the form of program synthesis, may help overcome some of these difficulties, by showing how a computer can incrementally learn concepts relevant to quantum circuit synthesis with experience, and reuse them in unseen tasks. In particular, we focus on the decomposition of unitary matrices into quantum circuits, and show how, starting from a set of elementary gates, we can automatically discover a library of useful new composite gates and use them to decompose increasingly complicated unitaries.

AB In the race for quantum-safe cryptography, fostered by the ongoing National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) post-quantum standardization process, it is crucial to assess the security of the emerging schemes. In this work, we propose a fully quantum algorithm to accelerate the Lee-Brickell's Information Set Decoding (ISD)-one of the main cryptanalytic techniques used for assessing the security of code-based schemes-on binary error correcting codes. Our solution relies on a careful scheduling of the quantum gates included in the circuit design, coupled with a strategy that applies multiple times the oracle-reflection, from a Grover-like search, within a single Grover iteration. Compared with the state-of-the-art alternatives, our solution shows a reduction of the circuit depth ranging between 23 and 226, when considering the parameters sets for code-based cryptosystems advanced to the fourth round of the NIST process. Denoting as t and t - p the two sets of bit flips tackled by the Lee-Brickell's strategy, as an additional noteworthy fact we show that our solution exhibits 1 as the best value for p instead of 2 as it is the case for the classic ISD, for all concrete parameter sets considered.

TI Effectiveness of quantum annealing for continuous-variable optimization
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB The application of quantum annealing to the optimization of continuous-variable functions is a relatively unexplored area of research. We test the performance of quantum annealing applied to a one-dimensional continuous-variable function with a rugged energy landscape. After domain-wall encoding to map a continuous variable to discrete Ising variables, we first benchmark the performance of the real hardware, the D-Wave 2000Q, against several state-of-the-art classical optimization algorithms designed for continuous-variable problems to find that the D-Wave 2000Q matches the classical algorithms in a limited domain of computation time. Beyond this domain, classical global optimization algorithms outperform the quantum device. Next we examine several optimization algorithms that are applicable to the Ising formulation of the problem, such as the time-evolving block decimation (TEBD) to simulate ideal coherent quantum annealing, simulated annealing, simulated quantum annealing, and spin-vector Monte Carlo. The data show that TEBD's coherent quantum annealing achieves far better results than the other approaches, demonstrating the effectiveness of coherent tunneling. From these two types of benchmarks, we conclude that the hardware realization of quantum annealing has the potential to significantly outperform the best classical algorithms if thermal noise and other imperfections are sufficiently suppressed and the device operates coherently, as demonstrated in recent short-time quantum simulations.

TI A hole spin qubit in a fin field-effect transistor above 4 kelvin
SO NATURE ELECTRONICS
AB The greatest challenge in quantum computing is achieving scalability. Classical computing, which previously faced such issues, currently relies on silicon chips hosting billions of fin field-effect transistors. These devices are small enough for quantum applications: at low temperatures, an electron or hole trapped under the gate can serve as a spin qubit. Such an approach potentially allows the quantum hardware and its classical control electronics to be integrated on the same chip. However, this requires qubit operation at temperatures above 1 K, where the cooling overcomes heat dissipation. Here we show that silicon fin field-effect transistors can host spin qubits operating above 4 K. We achieve fast electrical control of hole spins with driving frequencies up to 150 MHz, single-qubit gate fidelities at the fault-tolerance threshold and a Rabi-oscillation quality factor greater than 87. Our devices feature both industry compatibility and quality, and are fabricated in a flexible and agile way that should accelerate further development.
   Fin-shaped transistors can host hole spin qubits at high enough temperatures to potentially enable the scaling and development of quantum computing systems controlled by conventional electronics co-integrated in the same package.

TI Entanglement Generation in Capacitively Coupled Transmon-Cavity System

AB In this paper, the higher energy levels of the transmon qubit are taken into consideration to investigate the continuous variable entanglement generation between the transmon qubit and the single-mode cavity. Based on the framework of cavity Quantum Electrodynamics (QED), the authors show the entanglement generation depends on the driving field intensity, coupling strength, cavity field frequency, and qubit frequency. The numerical results show that strong entanglement can be generated by properly tuning these parameters. It is hoped that the results presented in this paper may lead to a better understanding of quantum entanglement generation in cavity QED systems and provide new perspectives for further research in quantum information processing.

TI Entanglement purification by counting and locating errors with
   entangling measurements
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB We consider entanglement purification protocols for multiple copies of qubit states. We use high-dimensional auxiliary entangled systems to learn about the number and positions of errors in the noisy ensemble in an explicit and controlled way, thereby reducing the amount of noise in the ensemble and purifying the remaining states. This allows us to design entanglement purification protocols for any number of copies that work particularly well for a small number of expected errors, i.e., high fidelity of initial states. The main tool is a counter gate with which the required nonlocal information can be transferred into the high-dimensional entangled qudit auxiliary states. We compare our schemes to standard recurrence protocols that operate on pairs of copies, and hashing and breeding protocols that operate on a (asymptotically) large number of copies. Our protocols interpolate between these two regimes, leading to higher achievable fidelity and yield. We illustrate our approach for bipartite qubit states and generalize it to purify multiparty GHZ states.

TI Fast Bayesian Tomography of a Two-Qubit Gate Set in Silicon
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW APPLIED
AB Benchmarking and characterizing quantum states and logic gates is essential in the development of devices for quantum computing. We introduce a Bayesian approach to self-consistent process tomography, called fast Bayesian tomography (FBT), and experimentally demonstrate its performance in characterizing a two-qubit gate set on a silicon-based spin qubit device. FBT is built on an adaptive self-consistent linearization that is robust to model approximation errors. Our method offers several advantages over other self-consistent tomographic methods. Most notably, FBT can leverage prior information from randomized benchmarking (or other characterization measurements), and can be performed in real time, providing continuously updated estimates of full process matrices while data are acquired.

TI Iteration-Free quantum approximate optimization algorithm using neural
   networks
SO QUANTUM MACHINE INTELLIGENCE
AB The quantum approximate optimization algorithm (QAOA) is a leading iterative variational quantum algorithm for heuristically solving combinatorial optimization problems. A large portion of the computational effort in QAOA is spent by the optimization steps, which require many executions of the quantum circuit. Therefore, there is active research focusing on finding better initial circuit parameters, which would reduce the number of required iterations and hence the overall execution time. While existing methods for parameter initialization have shown great success, they often offer a single set of parameters for all problem instances. We propose a practical method that uses a simple, fully connected neural network that leverages previous executions of QAOA to find better initialization parameters tailored to a new given problem instance. We benchmark state-of-the-art initialization methods for solving the MaxCut problem of Erd & odblac;s-R & eacute;nyi graphs using QAOA and show that our method is consistently the fastest to converge while also yielding the best final result. Furthermore, the parameters predicted by the neural network are shown to match very well with the fully optimized parameters, to the extent that no iterative steps are required, thereby effectively realizing an iteration-free QAOA scheme.

TI Nonequilibrium thermal transport in the two-mode qubit-resonator system
SO FRONTIERS IN PHYSICS
AB Nonequilibrium thermal transport in circuit quantum electrodynamics emerges as one interdisciplinary field, due to the tremendous advance of quantum technology. Here, we study steady-state heat flow in a two-mode qubit-resonator model under the influence of both the qubit-resonator and resonator-resonator interactions. The heat current is suppressed and enhanced by tuning up resonator-resonator interaction strength with given weak and strong qubit-resonator couplings respectively, which is cooperative contributed by the eigen-mode of coupled resonators and qubit-photon scattering. Negative differential thermal conductance and significant thermal rectification are exhibited at weak qubit-resonator coupling, which are dominated by cycle transition processes. Moreover, the heat flow through the resonator decoupled from the qubit can be dramatically enhanced via the resonator-resonator interaction, which is attributed by the generation of eigen-mode channels of resonators.

TI Investigation of phonon lifetimes and magnon-phonon coupling in YIG/GGG
   hybrid magnonic systems in the diffraction limited regime
SO JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYSICS
AB Quantum memories facilitate the storage and retrieval of quantum information for on-chip and long-distance quantum communications. Thus, they play a critical role in quantum information processing and have diverse applications ranging from aerospace to medical imaging fields. Bulk acoustic wave (BAW) phonons are attractive candidates for quantum memories because of their long lifetimes and high operating frequencies. In this study, we establish a modeling approach to design hybrid magnonic high-overtone bulk acoustic wave resonator (HBAR) structures for high-density, long-lasting quantum memories, and efficient quantum transduction devices. We illustrate the approach by investigating a hybrid magnonic system, consisting of a gadolinium iron garnet (GGG) thick film and a patterned yttrium iron garnet (YIG) thin film. The BAW phonons are excited in GGG thick film via coupling with magnons in the YIG thin film. We present theoretical and numerical analyses of the diffraction-limited BAW phonon lifetimes, modeshapes, and magnon-phonon coupling strengths in YIG/GGG planar and confocal HBAR (CHBAR) structures. We utilize Fourier beam propagation and Hankel transform eigenvalue problem methods and compare the two methods. We discuss strategies to improve the phonon lifetimes in the diffraction-limited regime, since increased lifetimes have direct implications on the storage times of quantum states for quantum memory applications. We find that ultra-high cooperativities and phonon lifetimes on the order of similar to 10(5) and similar to 10 milliseconds, respectively, could be achieved using a CHBAR structure with 10 mu m YIG lateral area. Additionally, high integration density of on-chip memory or transduction centers is naturally desired for high-density memory or transduction devices. The proposed CHBAR structure will offer more than 100-fold improvement of integration density relative to a recently demonstrated YIG/GGG device. Our results will have direct applicability for devices operating in the cryogenic or milliKelvin regimes. For example, our study will inform the design of HBAR devices that could couple with superconducting qubits for promising quantum information platforms.

TI Quantum algorithm for online convex optimization
SO QUANTUM SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB We explore whether quantum advantages can be found for the zeroth-order online convex optimization (OCO) problem, which is also known as bandit convex optimization with multi-point feedback. In this setting, given access to zeroth-order oracles (that is, the loss function is accessed as a black box that returns the function value for any queried input), a player attempts to minimize a sequence of adversarially generated convex loss functions. This procedure can be described as a T round iterative game between the player and the adversary. In this paper, we present quantum algorithms for the problem and show for the first time that potential quantum advantages are possible for problems of OCO. Specifically, our contributions are as follows. (i) When the player is allowed to query zeroth-order oracles O(1) times in each round as feedback, we give a quantum algorithm that achieves O(root T) regret without additional dependence of the dimension n, which outperforms the already known optimal classical algorithm only achieving O(root nT) regret. Note that the regret of our quantum algorithm has achieved the lower bound of classical first-order methods. (ii) We show that for strongly convex loss functions, the quantum algorithm can achieve O(log T) regret with O(1) queries as well, which means that the quantum algorithm can achieve the same regret bound as the classical algorithms in the full information setting.

TI An electrically driven single-atom "flip-flop" qubit
SO SCIENCE ADVANCES
AB The spins of atoms and atom-like systems are among the most coherent objects in which to store quantum information. However, the need to address them using oscillating magnetic fields hinders their integration with quantum electronic devices. Here, we circumvent this hurdle by operating a single-atom "flip-flop" qubit in silicon, where quantum information is encoded in the electron-nuclear states of a phosphorus donor. The qubit is controlled using local electric fields at microwave frequencies, produced within a metal-oxide-semiconductor device. The electrical drive is mediated by the modulation of the electron-nuclear hyperfine coupling, a method that can be extended to many other atomic and molecular systems and to the hyperpolarization of nuclear spin ensembles. These results pave the way to the construction of solid-state quantum processors where dense arrays of atoms can be controlled using only local electric fields.

TI Consensus-based qubit configuration optimization for variational
   algorithms on neutral atom quantum systems
SO NPJ QUANTUM INFORMATION
AB We report an algorithm that is able to tailor qubit interactions for individual variational quantum algorithm problems. The algorithm leverages the unique ability of a neutral atom tweezer platform to realize arbitrary qubit position configurations. These configurations determine the degree of entanglement available to a variational quantum algorithm via the interatomic interactions. Good configurations will accelerate pulse optimization convergence and help mitigate barren plateaus. As gradient-based approaches are ineffective for position optimization due to the divergent R-6 nature of Rydberg interactions, we opt to use a consensus-based algorithm. By sampling configuration space instead of using gradient information, the consensus-based algorithm is able to successfully optimize the positions, yielding adapted variational quantum algorithm ansatzes that lead to both faster convergence and lower errors. We show that these optimized configurations generally result in large improvements in the system's ability to solve ground state minimization problems for both random Hamiltonians and small molecules.

TI Error Correction of Transversal CNOT Gates for Scalable Surface-Code
   Computation
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB Recent experimental advances have made it possible to implement logical multiqubit transversal gates on surface codes in a multitude of platforms. A transversal controlled-NOT (tCNOT) gate on two surface codes introduces correlated errors across the code blocks and thus requires modified decoding compared to established methods of decoding surface-code quantum memory (SCQM) or lattice-surgery operations. In this work, we examine and benchmark the performance of three different decoding strategies for the tCNOT for scalable fault-tolerant quantum computation. In particular, we present a low-complexity decoder based on minimum-weight perfect matching (MWPM) that achieves the same threshold as the SCQM MWPM decoder. We extend our analysis with a study of tailored decoding of a transversal-teleportation circuit, along with a comparison between the performance of lattice-surgery and transversal operations under Pauli- and erasure-noise models. Our investigation builds toward systematic estimation of the cost of implementing large-scale quantum algorithms based on transversal gates in the surface code.

We complement the framework by providing an independent software library to perform the Pauli tracking, specifically in the context of measurement-based quantum computing. Tracking Pauli operators allows one to reduce the number of Pauli gates that must be executed on quantum hardware and to capture the constraints on the order of measurements. The scheduling problem is numerically investigated on small scale.

TI Classifying and Benchmarking Quantum Annealing Algorithms Based on
   Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization for Solving NP-Hard Problems
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB Quantum annealing has the potential to outperform classical transistor-based computer technologies in tackling intricate combinatorial optimization problems. However, ongoing scientific debates cast doubts on whether quantum annealing devices (or quantum annealers) can genuinely provide better problem-solving capabilities than classical computers. The question of whether quantum annealing algorithms (QAAs) running on quantum annealers have computational advantages over classical algorithms (CAs) running on classical computers still remains unclear. This paper aims to clarify the question by classifying and benchmarking QAAs that utilize quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO) formulas to solve NP-hard problems. It proposes a four-class classification of QUBO formulas and exemplifies each class by QUBO formulas used by QAAs for solving specific NP-hard problems, such as the subset sum, maximum cut, vertex cover, 0/1 knapsack, graph coloring, Hamiltonian cycle, traveling salesperson, and job shop scheduling problems. The classification is based on the following two criteria: (i) Does the number of QUBO variables scale linearly with the problem input size? (ii) Does the QUBO formula have both the constraint term and the optimization term? QAAs are implemented and run on a D-Wave quantum annealer for benchmarking. They are benchmarked against related CAs in terms of the quality of the solution and the time to the solution. The benchmarking results reveal which classes of QUBO formulas are likely to provide advantages to QAAs over CAs. Furthermore, based on the benchmarking results, observations and suggestions are given for each class of QUBO formulas, facilitating the adoption of appropriate actions to improve the performance of QAAs.

TI Planar weibull quantum circuit genetic algorithm with strong search
   ability and its implementation
SO PHYSICA SCRIPTA
AB Genetic Algorithm (GA) is a widely used search method, and Quantum Genetic Algorithm (QGA) has been pointed out for several years. While common QGA only refers to the concept of quantum mechanics, and still uses mathematical representations of quantum states to simulate quantum entanglement and superposition, it can't be realized on a quantum computer. This paper presents an implementable quantum circuit for a genetic algorithm, named as Planar-Weibull Quantum Circuit Genetic Algorithm (PW-QCGA), employing the Weibull function and excitation function through planar matrix coding. It is not only a self-adaptive algorithm that adjusts parameters dynamically, but it can also be executed on quantum computers by constructing parameterized quantum circuits. Experiments on three typical applications show that PW-QCGA not only has obvious advantages on convergence accuracy, search ability, convergence speed, and robustness, but also has higher fidelity on a quantum computer. We hope this work can bring inspiration to other quantum intelligent algorithms.

TI A GHZ-Based Protocol for the Dining Information Brokers Problem
SO FUTURE INTERNET
AB This article introduces the innovative Quantum Dining Information Brokers Problem, presenting a novel entanglement-based quantum protocol to address it. The scenario involves n information brokers, all located in distinct geographical regions, engaging in a metaphorical virtual dinner. The objective is for each broker to share a unique piece of information with all the others simultaneously. Unlike previous approaches, this protocol enables a fully parallel, single-step communication exchange among all the brokers, regardless of their physical locations. A key feature of this protocol is its ability to ensure that both the anonymity and privacy of all the participants are preserved, meaning that no broker can discern the identity of the sender of any received information. At its core, the Quantum Dining Information Brokers Problem serves as a conceptual framework for achieving anonymous, untraceable, and massively parallel information exchange in a distributed system. The proposed protocol introduces three significant advancements. First, while quantum protocols for one-to-many simultaneous information transmission have been developed, this is, to the best of our knowledge, one of the first quantum protocols to facilitate many-to-many simultaneous information exchange. Second, it guarantees complete anonymity and untraceability for all senders, a critical improvement over sequential applications of one-to-many protocols, which fail to ensure such robust anonymity. Third, leveraging quantum entanglement, the protocol operates in a fully distributed manner, accommodating brokers in diverse spatial locations. This approach marks a substantial advancement in secure, scalable, and anonymous communication, with potential applications in distributed environments where privacy and parallelism are paramount.

TI Quantum decoherence effects: A complete treatment
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW D
AB Physical systems in real life are inextricably linked to their surroundings and never completely separated from them. Truly closed systems do not exist. The phenomenon of decoherence, which is brought about by the interaction with the environment, removes the relative phase of quantum states in superposition and makes them incoherent. In neutrino physics, decoherence, although extensively studied has only been analyzed thus far exclusively in terms of its dissipative characteristics. While it is true that dissipation, or the exponential suppression, eventually is the main observable effect, the exchange of energy between the medium and the system, is an important factor that has been overlooked up until now. In this work, we introduce this term and analyze its consequences.

TI Convergence condition of simulated quantum annealing for closed and open
   systems
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Simulated quantum annealing is a generic classical protocol to simulate some aspects of quantum annealing and is sometimes regarded as a classical alternative to quantum annealing in finding the ground state of a classical Ising model. We derive a generic condition for simulated quantum annealing to converge to thermal equilibrium at a given, typically low, temperature. Both closed and open systems are treated. We rewrite the classical master equation for simulated quantum annealing into an imaginary-time Schrodinger equation, to which we apply the imaginary-time variant of the asymptotic adiabatic condition to deduce the convergence condition. The result agrees qualitatively with a rigorous convergence condition of simulated quantum annealing for closed systems, which was derived from the theory of inhomogeneous Markov processes. Also observed is qualitative agreement with a rigorous convergence condition of quantum annealing for closed systems under the real-time Schrodinger dynamics. This coincidence of convergence conditions for classical stochastic processes for simulated quantum annealing and the real-time quantum dynamics for quantum annealing is highly nontrivial and calls for further scrutiny.

TI Simulation of Higher-Dimensional Discrete Time Crystals on a Quantum
   Computer
SO CRYSTALS
AB The study of topologically ordered states has given rise to a growing interest in symmetry-protected states in quantum matter. Recently, this theory has been extended to quantum many-body systems, which demonstrate ordered states at low temperatures. An example of this is the discrete time crystal (DTC), which has been demonstrated in a real quantum computer and in driven systems. These states are periodic in time and are protected from disorder to a certain extent. In general, DTCs can be classified into two phases: the stable many-body localization (MBL) state and the disordered thermal state. This work demonstrates the by generalizing DTCs to two dimensions, where there was an decrease in the thermal noise and an increase in the operating range of the MBL range in the presence of disorder.

TI Quantum Algorithm for Solving the Wave Equation on a Hexagonal Grid
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB Numerical methods based on finite differences for solving the wave equation are prone to various errors, a challenge that also applies to the semi-discrete case of a recently proposed quantum algorithm that preserves continuous time while discretizing space into a quantum state vector. The inherent limitations of quantum processing, which affect the generality and extensibility of the quantum algorithm compared to classical numerical solvers, are offset by the logarithmic scaling of the number of qubits with the number of grid points. The higher grid density in combination with the higher-order approximation of the continuous Laplacian operator improves the numerical accuracy. In contrast to the Dirichlet boundary condition, however, the Neumann boundary condition in the quantum algorithm cannot exceed a second-order Laplacian approximation. Moreover, the anisotropy error is inherent to the lattice geometry. In this work, we propose a quantum wave equation solver on a hexagonal grid, which exhibits intrinsic grid dispersion comparable to that of a fourth-order accurate method on a rectangular grid and provides a quadratic improvement in the anisotropy measures. We show that the graph Laplacian on a hexagonal grid embedding the Neumann boundary condition is a bidirected graph. To make it suitable for use as a system Hamiltonian, a symmetrization and factorization based on the asymmetric adjacency matrix is proposed. Dispersion relations for quantum algorithms solving the wave equation on different lattices are derived and compared. The algorithms are analyzed as a limiting case of Yee's finite-difference time-domain method in the context of electromagnetic wave propagation.

TI Illinois Express Quantum Network (IEQNET): Metropolitan-scale
   experimental quantum networking over deployed optical fiber

CY APR 12-16, 2021
CL ELECTR NETWORK
SP SPIE
AB The Illinois Express Quantum Network (IEQNET) is a program to realize metro-scale quantum networking over deployed optical fiber using currently available technology. IEQNET consists of multiple sites that are geographically dispersed in the Chicago metropolitan area. Each site has one or more quantum nodes (Q-nodes) representing the communication parties in a quantum network. Q-nodes generate or measure quantum signals such as entangled photons and communicate the results via standard, classical, means. The entangled photons in IEQNET nodes are generated at multiple wavelengths, and are selectively distributed to the desired users via optical switches. Here we describe the network architecture of IEQNET, including the Internet-inspired layered hierarchy that leverages software-defined-networking (SDN) technology to perform traditional wavelength routing and assignment between the Q-nodes. Specifically, SDN decouples the control and data planes, with the control plane being entirely classical. Issues associated with synchronization, calibration, network monitoring, and scheduling will be discussed. An important goal of IEQNET is demonstrating the extent to which the control plane can coexist with the data plane using the same fiber lines. This goal is furthered by the use of tunable narrow-band optical filtering at the receivers and, at least in some cases, a wide wavelength separation between the quantum and classical channels. We envision IEQNET to aid in developing robust and practical quantum networks by demonstrating metro-scale quantum communication tasks such as entanglement distribution and quantum-state teleportation.

TI Visualizing quasiparticles from quantum entanglement for general
   one-dimensional phases
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
AB In this paper, we present a quantum information framework for the entanglement behavior of the low-energy quasiparticle (QP) excitations in various quantum phases in one-dimensional (1D) systems. We first establish an exact correspondence between the correlation matrix and the QP entanglement Hamiltonian for free fermions and find an extended in-gap state in the QP entanglement Hamiltonian as a consequence of the position uncertainty of the QP. A more general understanding of such an in-gap state can be extended to a Kramers theorem for the QP entanglement Hamiltonian, which also applies to strongly interacting systems. Further, we present a set of ubiquitous entanglement spectrum features, dubbed entanglement fragmentation, conditional mutual information, and measurement-induced nonlocal entanglement for QPs in 1D symmetry protected topological phases. Our result thus provides another framework to identify different phases of matter in terms of their QP entanglement.

TI Quantum Resources Required to Block-Encode a Matrix of Classical Data
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON QUANTUM ENGINEERING
AB We provide modular circuit-level implementations and resource estimates for several methods of block-encoding a dense NxN matrix of classical data to precision & varepsilon;; the minimal-depth method achieves a T-depth of O(log(N/& varepsilon;)), while the minimal-count method achieves a T-count of O(Nlog(1/& varepsilon;)). We examine resource tradeoffs between the different approaches, and we explore implementations of two separate models of quantum random access memory (QRAM). As part of this analysis, we provide a novel state preparation routine with T-depth O(log(N/& varepsilon;)), improving on previous constructions with scaling O(log(2)(N/& varepsilon;)). Our results go beyond simple query complexity and provide a clear picture into the resource costs when large amounts of classical data are assumed to be accessible to quantum algorithms.

TI LArTPC hit-based topology classification with quantum machine learning
   and symmetry considerations
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW D
AB We present a new approach to separate tracklike and showerlike topologies in liquid argon time projection chamber (LArTPC) experiments for neutrino physics using quantum machine learning. Effective reconstruction of neutrino events in LArTPCs requires accurate and granular information about the energy deposited in the detector. These energy deposits can be viewed as 2D images. Simulated data from the MicroBooNE experiment and a simple custom dataset are used to perform pixel-level classification of the underlying particle topology. Images of the events have been studied by creating small patches around each pixel to characterize its topology based on its immediate neighborhood. This classification is achieved using convolution-based learning models, including quantum-enhanced architectures known as quanvolutional neural networks. The quanvolutional networks are extended to symmetries beyond translation. Rotational symmetry has been incorporated into a subset of the models. This study demonstrates that quantum-enhanced models perform better than their classical counterparts with a comparable number of parameters, but are outperformed by classical models with two orders of magnitude more parameters. The inclusion of rotation symmetry appears beneficial only in a small number of cases and remains to be explored further. Possible future use of quantum machine learning in the reconstruction phase is discussed, with emphasis on future LArTPC experiments such as Deep Underground Neutrino Experiment (DUNE)-far detector (FD).

TI OFDM-based quantum key distribution access network reaching Nyquist
   limits
SO OPTICA
AB Quantum key distribution (QKD) can theoretically accomplish unconditionally secure communication with the support of quantum mechanics. The point-to-point QKD system has already been well developed, and the focus of advanced research has shifted more toward QKD networks. However, it is still unclear how to achieve the maximum secret key rate within the limited physical bandwidth in QKD networks. In this paper, we propose an orthogonal frequency division multiplexing continuous-variable QKD access network (CV-QAN), which improves the bandwidth utilization efficiency to the Nyquist limit. Specifically, each quantum network unit prepares a carrier-modulated Gaussian-modulated coherent state so that they become orthogonal in the frequency domain when received by the quantum line terminal. Crosstalk arising from the multi-path effect among multi-mode quantum states was effectively suppressed through the implementation of a cyclic prefix. In this theory, we have demonstrated the feasibility of this scheme through the continuous-mode Gaussian information theory. In this experiment, we conducted a local local oscillator (LLO) CV-QAN experiment within the existing passive optical network architecture. The network capacity of CV-QAN is 7, and the secret key rate of each user reaches 4.06 and 0.87 Mbps at 25 km in the asymptotic case and the finite-size effect, respectively. This achievement has established an efficient and simple QAN based on digital signal processing, laying the foundation for the practicality and commercialization of large-scale quantum networks.

TI Virtual Screening of Chemical Space Based on Quantum Annealing
SO JOURNAL OF THE PHYSICAL SOCIETY OF JAPAN
AB For searching a new chemical material which satisfies the target characteristic value, for example emission wavelength, many cut and trial of experiments=calculations are required since the chemical space is astronomically large (organic molecules generates >10(60) candidates). Extracting feature importance is a method to reduce the chemical space, and limiting the search space to those features leads to shorter development time. Quantum computer can generate sampling data faster than classical computers, and this property is utilized to extract feature importance. In this paper, quantum annealer was used as a sampler to make data for extracting feature importance of material properties. By screening the chemical space with feature importance, it was found that the chemical space can be reduced to less than 1 percent. This result suggests that the acceleration of material research can be achievable.

TI Analog quantum simulation of chemical dynamics
SO CHEMICAL SCIENCE
AB Ultrafast chemical reactions are difficult to simulate because they involve entangled, many-body wavefunctions whose computational complexity grows rapidly with molecular size. In photochemistry, the breakdown of the Born-Oppenheimer approximation further complicates the problem by entangling nuclear and electronic degrees of freedom. Here, we show that analog quantum simulators can efficiently simulate molecular dynamics using commonly available bosonic modes to represent molecular vibrations. Our approach can be implemented in any device with a qudit controllably coupled to bosonic oscillators and with quantum hardware resources that scale linearly with molecular size, and offers significant resource savings compared to digital quantum simulation algorithms. Advantages of our approach include a time resolution orders of magnitude better than ultrafast spectroscopy, the ability to simulate large molecules with limited hardware using a Suzuki-Trotter expansion, and the ability to implement realistic system-bath interactions with only one additional interaction per mode. Our approach can be implemented with current technology; e.g., the conical intersection in pyrazine can be simulated using a single trapped ion. Therefore, we expect our method will enable classically intractable chemical dynamics simulations in the near term.

SO PHOTONICS
AB By coherently combining advantages while largely avoiding limitations of two mainstream platforms, optical hybrid entanglement involving both discrete and continuous variables has recently garnered widespread attention and emerged as a promising idea for building heterogenous quantum networks. In contrast to previous results, here we propose a new scheme to remotely generate hybrid entanglement between discrete polarization and continuous quadrature optical qubits heralded by two-photon Bell-state measurement. As a novel nonclassical light resource, we further use it to discuss two examples of ways-entanglement swapping and quantum teleportation-in which quantum information processing and communications could make use of this hybrid technique.

TI Quantum Dot-Organic Molecule Conjugates as Hosts for Photogenerated Spin
   Qubit Pairs
SO JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN CHEMICAL SOCIETY
AB The inherent spin polarization present in photogenerated spin-correlated radical pairs makes them promising candidates for quantum computing and quantum sensing applications. The spin states of these systems can be probed and manipulated with microwave pulses using electron paramagnetic resonance spectrometers. However, to date, there are no reports on magnetic resonance-based spin measurements of photogenerated spin-correlated radical pairs hosted on quantum dots. In the current work, we prepare dye molecule-inorganic quantum dot conjugates and show that they can produce photogenerated spin-polarized states. The dye molecule, D131, is chosen for its ability to undergo efficient charge separation, and the nanoparticle materials, ZnO quantum dots, are chosen for their promising spin properties. Transient and steady state optical spectroscopy performed on ZnO quantum dot-D131 conjugates shows that reversible photogenerated charge separation is occurring. Transient and pulsed electron paramagnetic resonance experiments are then performed on the photogenerated radical pair, which demonstrate that (1) the radical pair is polarized at moderate temperatures and well modeled by existing theories and (2) the spin states can be accessed and manipulated with microwave pulses. This work opens the door to a new class of promising qubit materials that can be photogenerated in polarized states and hosted by highly tailorable inorganic nanoparticles.

TI Computation-Aided Classical-Quantum Multiple Access to Boost Network
   Communication Speeds
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW APPLIED
AB A multiple access channel (MAC) consists of multiple senders simultaneously transmitting their messages to a single receiver. For the classical-quantum case (CQ MAC), achievable rates are known assuming that all the messages are decoded, a common assumption in quantum network design. However, such a conventional design approach ignores the global network structure, i.e., the network topology. When a CQ MAC is given as a part of quantum network communication, this work shows that computation properties can be used to boost communication speeds with code design dependent on the network topology. We quantify achievable quantum communication rates of codes with the computation property for a two-sender CQ MAC. When the two-sender CQ MAC is a boson coherent channel with binary discrete modulation, we show that it achieves the maximum possible communication rate (the single-user capacity), which cannot be achieved with conventional design. Further, such a rate can be achieved by different detection methods: quantum (with and without quantum memory), on-off photon counting, and homodyne (each at different photon power). Finally, we describe two practical applications, one of which cryptographic.

Here, we report the experimental demonstration of the generation of ultra-broadband frequency-correlated photon pairs using a high-index contrast doped glass microring resonator fabricated on a silicon chip. The generated photon pairs exhibit frequency correlation between 106 mode pairs and 212 frequency combs in total, ranging from 1394.0 to 1745.9 nm with the bandwidth of 351.9 nm and covering the telecom E-, S-, C-, L-, and U-bands. The bandwidth of the photon pairs is more than three times larger than the record so far achieved with an on-chip microring resonator. This result will be useful for secure quantum communications and high-resolution quantum optical coherence tomography.

TI Polarization-orbital angular momentum duality assisted entanglement
   observation for indistinguishable photons
SO QUANTUM INFORMATION PROCESSING
AB Duality in the entanglement of identical particles manifests that entanglement in only one variable can be revealed at a time. We demonstrate this using polarization and orbital angular momentum (OAM) variables of indistinguishable photons generated from parametric down-conversion. We show polarization entanglement by sorting photons in even and odd OAM basis, while sorting them in two orthogonal polarization modes reveals the OAM entanglement. Indistinguishable photons entangled in two variables could find applications in robust quantum communication, remote entanglement generation and distributed quantum sensing.

TI Optimization of quantum-dot qubit fabrication via machine learning
SO APPLIED PHYSICS LETTERS
AB Precise nanofabrication represents a critical challenge to developing semiconductor quantum-dot qubits for practical quantum computation. Here, we design and train a convolutional neural network to interpret scanning electron micrographs and quantify qualitative features affecting device functionality. The high-throughput strategy is exemplified by optimizing a model lithographic process within a five-dimensional design space and by demonstrating a robust approach to address lithographic proximity effects. The results emphasize the benefits of machine learning for developing stable processes, shortening development cycles, and enforcing quality control during qubit fabrication.

AB Quantum circuit cutting allows an arbitrary circuit to be executed on a quantum computer with fewer qubits by fragmenting it into subcircuits, each with fewer qubits. If such a method is to be employed, it is critical that the quantum properties of the original circuit, such as entanglement, are not violated. This paper demonstrates, using circuit cutting tools, how to select circuit bipartitions while prioritising the preservation of underlying entanglement between the qubits. We present two entanglement-based criteria. The former minimises losses of reduced-state pairwise qubit entanglement, and has polynomial complexity in the number of qubits. The latter minimises loss of multipartite entanglement across qubit bipartitions, with exponential complexity. Violations of entanglement with frequencies up to 72% are observed in current circuit cutting software. This paper describes how to prevent such violations, or to minimise qubit entanglement losses, fragmenting circuits with pairwise qubit negativity losses of only 5%, and for certain circuits 0% von Neumann entropy losses across qubit bipartitions.

TI A flying Schrodinger's cat in multipartite entangled states
SO SCIENCE ADVANCES
AB Schrodinger's cat originates from the famous thought experiment querying the counterintuitive quantum superposition of macroscopic objects. As a natural extension, several "cats" (quasi-classical objects) can be prepared into coherent quantum superposition states, which is known as multipartite cat states demonstrating quantum entanglement among macroscopically distinct objects. Here, we present a highly scalable approach to deterministically create flying multipartite Schrodinger's cat states by reflecting coherent-state photons from a microwave cavity containing a superconducting qubit. We perform full quantum state tomography on the cat states with up to four photonic modes and confirm the existence of quantum entanglement among them. We also witness the hybrid entanglement between discrete-variable states (the qubit) and continuous-variable states (the flying multipartite cat) through a joint quantum state tomography. Our work provides an enabling step for implementing a series of quantum metrology and quantum information processing protocols based on cat states.

TI Quantum decoherence by magnetic fluctuations in a magnetic topological
   insulator
SO NPJ QUANTUM MATERIALS
AB In magnetic topological insulators, spontaneous time-reversal symmetry breaking by intrinsic magnetic order can gap the topological surface spectrum, resulting in exotic properties like axion electrodynamics, the quantum anomalous Hall effect, and other topological magnetoelectric responses. Understanding the magnetic order and its coupling to topological states is essential to harness these properties. Here, we leverage near-resonant magnetic dipole optical second harmonic generation to probe magnetic fluctuations in the candidate axion insulator EuSn2(As,P)2 across its antiferromagnetic phase boundary. We observe a pronounced dimensional crossover in the quantum decoherence induced by magnetic fluctuations, whereby two-dimensional in-plane ferromagnetic correlations at high temperatures give way to three-dimensional long-range order at the N & eacute;el temperature. We also observe the breaking of rotational symmetry within the long-range-ordered antiferromagnetic state and map out the resulting spatial domain structure. More generally, we demonstrate the unique capabilities of nonlinear optical spectroscopy to study quantum coherence and fluctuations in magnetic quantum materials.

TI Qubit-excitation-based adaptive variational quantum eigensolver
SO COMMUNICATIONS PHYSICS
AB Existing methods for molecular simulations with quantum computers use ansatz constructed as series of fermionic excitation evolution. Here, qubit excitation evolutions are employed instead, in combination with the ADAPT-VQE protocol, to construct short and accurate ansatz suitable for noisy and imperfect quantum computers.
   Molecular simulations with the variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) are a promising application for emerging noisy intermediate-scale quantum computers. Constructing accurate molecular ansatze that are easy to optimize and implemented by shallow quantum circuits is crucial for the successful implementation of such simulations. Ansatze are, generally, constructed as series of fermionic-excitation evolutions. Instead, we demonstrate the usefulness of constructing ansatze with "qubit-excitation evolutions", which, contrary to fermionic excitation evolutions, obey "qubit commutation relations". We show that qubit excitation evolutions, despite the lack of some of the physical features of fermionic excitation evolutions, accurately construct ansatze, while requiring asymptotically fewer gates. Utilizing qubit excitation evolutions, we introduce the qubit-excitation-based adaptive (QEB-ADAPT)-VQE protocol. The QEB-ADAPT-VQE is a modification of the ADAPT-VQE that performs molecular simulations using a problem-tailored ansatz, grown iteratively by appending evolutions of qubit excitation operators. By performing classical numerical simulations for small molecules, we benchmark the QEB-ADAPT-VQE, and compare it against the original fermionic-ADAPT-VQE and the qubit-ADAPT-VQE. In terms of circuit efficiency and convergence speed, we demonstrate that the QEB-ADAPT-VQE outperforms the qubit-ADAPT-VQE, which to our knowledge was the previous most circuit-efficient scalable VQE protocol for molecular simulations.

TI Implementation of the HHL Algorithm for Solving the Poisson Equation on
   Quantum Simulators
SO APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL
AB The Poisson equation is a fundamental equation of mathematical physics that describes the potential distribution in static fields. Solving the Poisson equation on a grid is computationally intensive and can be challenging for large grids. In recent years, quantum computing has emerged as a potential approach to solving the Poisson equation more efficiently. This article uses quantum algorithms, particularly the Harrow-Hassidim-Lloyd (HHL) algorithm, to solve the 2D Poisson equation. This algorithm can solve systems of equations faster than classical algorithms when the matrix A is sparse. The main idea is to use a quantum algorithm to transform the state vector encoding the solution of a system of equations into a superposition of states corresponding to the significant components of this solution. This superposition is measured to obtain the solution of the system of equations. The article also presents the materials and methods used to solve the Poisson equation using the HHL algorithm and provides a quantum circuit diagram. The results demonstrate the low error rate of the quantum algorithm when solving the Poisson equation.

TI Optimizing two-qubit gates for ultracold atoms using Fermi-Hubbard
   models
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW APPLIED
AB Ultracold atoms trapped in optical lattices have emerged as a scalable and promising platform for quantum simulation and computation; however, gate speeds remain a significant limitation for practical applications. In this work, we employ quantum optimal control to design fast, collision-based two-qubit gates within a superlattice based on a Fermi-Hubbard description, reaching errors in the range 10-3 for realistic parameters. Numerically optimizing the lattice depths and the scattering length, we effectively manipulate hopping and interaction strengths intrinsic to the Fermi-Hubbard model. Our results provide five times shorter gate durations by allowing for higher energy bands in the optimization, suggesting that standard modeling with a two-band Fermi-Hubbard model is insufficient for describing the dynamics of fast gates, and we find that four to six bands are required. Additionally, we achieve nonadiabatic gates by employing time-dependent lattice depths rather than using only fixed depths. The optimized control pulses not only maintain high efficacy in the presence of laser-intensity and phase noise but also result in negligible interwell couplings.

TI Creating Entangled Logical Qubits in the Heavy-Hex Lattice with
   Topological Codes
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB Designs for quantum error correction depend strongly on the connectivity of the qubits. For solid-state qubits, the most straightforward approach is to have connectivity constrained to a planar graph. Practical considerations may also further restrict the connectivity, resulting in a relatively sparse graph such as the heavy-hexagonal ("heavy-hex") architecture of current IBM Quantum devices. In such cases, it is hard to use all qubits to their full potential. Instead, in order to emulate the denser connectivity required to implement well-known quantum error-correcting codes, many qubits remain effectively unused. In this work, we show how this bug can be turned into a feature. By using the unused qubits of one code to execute another, two codes can be implemented on top of each other, allowing easy application of fault-tolerant entangling gates and measurements. We demonstrate this by realizing a surface code and a Bacon-Shor code on a 133-qubit IBM Quantum device. Using transversal controlled-X (CX) gates and lattice surgery, we demonstrate entanglement between these logical qubits with code distance up to d = 4 and five rounds of stabilizer-measurement cycles. The nonplanar coupling between the qubits allows us to simultaneously measure the logical XX, YY, and ZZ observables. With this, we verify the violation of Bell's inequality for both the d = 2 case with postselection featuring a fidelity of 94% and the d = 3 instance using only quantum error correction.

TI Deep learning for classifying quantum emission signals in WS2
   monolayers using wavelet transform
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB This study aimed to develop and evaluate deep learning approaches for the classification of quantum emission signals from WS2 monolayer nanobubbles across multiple spectral bands, addressing challenges in quantum materials characterization and spectral distinguishability assessment. We utilized a dataset of quantum emission signals ranging from 604 to 629 nm, emitted from WS2 monolayer nanobubbles on gold substrates, categorized into four spectral bands (604.06-608.24 nm, 611.07-616.34 nm, 617.42-623.35 nm, and 624.16-636.57 nm). Our methodology involved signal preprocessing through normalization and moving average smoothing, followed by transformation into 128 x 128 RGB images using Continuous Wavelet Transform (CWT) with Complex Morlet wavelet. Three convolutional neural network architectures (ResNet50, VGG16, and Xception) were implemented and evaluated using fivefold cross-validation across six possible band pair combinations. All models demonstrated exceptional classification performance, with VGG16 achieving the highest overall mean accuracy of 99.4%, followed by Xception (99.1%) and ResNet50 (98.2%). Perfect classification accuracy (100%) was consistently achieved for spectrally distant band pairs, particularly Band 1 versus Band 4 (20.5 nm separation), while the most challenging classification involved adjacent bands (Band 2 vs. Band 3, 6.27 nm separation) with VGG16 achieving 96.5% accuracy. Statistical analysis using Friedman tests confirmed significant performance differences among models (chi 2 = 8.67, p = 0.013). Xception demonstrated remarkable computational efficiency, achieving optimal convergence in as few as 2 epochs for certain band combinations while maintaining ultralow training loss values (8.23 x 10(-)6). Deep learning models, particularly when combined with CWT preprocessing, provide a robust framework for quantum emission signal classification with significant implications for quantum photonics, quantum cryptography, and quantum sensing applications. Our approach bridges the gap between classical machine learning and quantum materials characterization, establishing quantifiable metrics for evaluating spectral distinguishability in quantum information systems. The demonstrated ability to achieve high classification accuracy with minimal training through transfer learning addresses data scarcity challenges inherent to quantum systems, offering a promising direction for future quantum technology development.

TI Coherent photoelectrical readout of single spins in silicon carbide at
   room temperature
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Establishing a robust and integratable quantum system capable of sensitive qubit readout at ambient conditions is a key challenge for developing prevalent quantum technologies, including quantum networks and quantum sensing. Paramagnetic colour centres in wide bandgap semiconductors provide optical single-spin detection, yet realising efficient electrical readout technology in scalable material will unchain developing integrated ambient quantum electronics. Here, we demonstrate photoelectrical detection of single spins in silicon carbide, a material amenable to large-scale processing and electronic integration. With efficient photocarrier collection, we achieve a 1.7-2 times better signal-to-noise ratio for single spins of silicon vacancies with electrical detection than with optical detection suffering from saturating fluorescence and internal reflection. Based on our photoionisation dynamics study, further improvement would be expected with enhanced ionisation. We also observe single-defect-like features in the photocurrent image where photoluminescence is absent in the spectrum range of silicon vacancies. The efficient electrical readout in the mature material platform holds promise for developing integrated quantum devices.

AB This work focuses on understanding the quantum message complexity of two central problems in distributed computing, namely, leader election and agreement in synchronous message-passing communication networks. We show that quantum communication gives an advantage for both problems by presenting quantum distributed algorithms that significantly outperform their respective classical counterparts under various network topologies. While prior works have studied and analyzed quantum distributed algorithms in the context of (improving) round complexity, a key conceptual contribution of our work is positing a framework to design and analyze the message complexity of quantum distributed algorithms. We present and demonstrate how quantum algorithmic techniques, such as Grover search, quantum counting, and quantum walks, can significantly enhance the message efficiency of distributed algorithms. In particular, our leader election protocol for diameter-2 networks uses quantum walks to achieve the improved message complexity. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first such application of quantum walks in distributed computing.

TI Concentration-dependent optical and spin inhomogeneous linewidth of
   europium-doped yttrium orthosilicate crystals
SO ACTA PHYSICA SINICA
AB The transportable quantum memory is a feasible solution for realizing the long-distance quantum communication, which requires a storage lifetime of the order of hours. The isotope-enriched Eu-151(3+):Y2SiO5 crystal is a promising candidate for this application. However, its optical storage efficiency and spin storage lifetime are limited by the wide inhomogeneous linewidth. In this work, we successfully grow isotope-enriched (151) Eu3+:Y2SiO5 crystals with varying doping concentrations by utilizing the Czochralski method. The optical inhomogeneous broadening and spin inhomogeneous broadening are measured by the optical absorption spectroscopy and optically detected magnetic resonance tests, respectively. Notably, in the undoped samples, we identify a baseline level of inhomogeneous linewidths, happening at (390 +/- 15) MHz for optical inhomogeneous broadening and (4.6 +/- 0.2) kHz for spin inhomogeneous broadening. Our findings reveal that the point defects, induced by the doping ions, significantly contribute to the inhomogeneous broadening. For every increase of 10(-6) in doping concentration, the optical inhomogeneous broadening increases by 0.97 MHz, and the spin inhomogeneous broadening increases by 0.014 kHz. Furthermore, we discuss the influence of dislocations on inhomogeneous broadening and propose potential strategies to further mitigate these effects. These advancements are expected to promote the development of ultra-long-lifetime transportable quantum memory applications.

TI Perceiving Quantum Hacking for Quantum Key Distribution Using Temporal
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW APPLIED
AB Quantum key distribution (QKD) can generate secure key bits between remote users with quantum mechanics. However, the gap between the theoretical model and practical realizations gives eavesdroppers opportunities to intercept the secret key. The most insidious attacks, known as quantum hacking, are the ones with no significant discrepancy of the measurement results using side-channel loopholes of QKD systems. Depicting full-time-scale characteristics of the quantum signals, the quantum channel, and the QKD system can provide legitimate users extra capabilities to defeat malicious attacks. Here, we propose the method exploring a temporal ghost-imaging (TGI) scheme to perceive quantum hacking with temporal fingerprints and experimentally verify its validity. The scheme presents a common approach to promote QKD's practical security from a unique perspective of signals and systems.

TI A guided light system for agile individual addressing of Ba+
   qubits with 10-4 level intensity crosstalk
SO QUANTUM SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB Trapped ions are one of the leading platforms for quantum information processing, exhibiting the highest gate and measurement fidelities of all contending hardware. In order to realize a universal quantum computer with trapped ions, independent and parallel control over the state of each qubit is necessary. The manipulation of individual qubit states in an ion chain via stimulated Raman transitions generally requires light focused on individual ions. In this manuscript, we present a novel, guided-light individual addressing system for hyperfine Ba+ qubits. The system takes advantage of laser-written waveguide technology, enabled by the atomic structure of Ba+, allowing the use of visible light to drive Raman transitions. Such waveguides define the spatial mode of light, suppressing aberrations that would have otherwise accumulated in a free-space optics set up. As a result, we demonstrate a nearest neighbor relative intensity crosstalk on the order of 10(-4), without any active aberration compensation. This is comparable to or better than other previous demonstrations of individual addressing. At the same time, our modular approach provides independent and agile control over the amplitude, frequency, and phase of each channel; combining the strengths of previous implementations.

TI Quantum metrology with one auxiliary particle in a correlated bath and
   its quantum simulation
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB In realistic metrology, entangled probes are more sensitive to noise, especially for a correlated environment. The precision of parameter estimation with entangled probes is even lower than that of the unentangled ones in a correlated environment. In this paper we propose a measurement scheme with only one auxiliary qubit, which can selectively offset the impact of environmental noise under this situation. We analyze the estimation precision of our scheme and find out that it approaches the Heisenberg limit when prepared in a proper auxiliary state. We further discuss employing auxiliary states to improve the precision of measurement in other environment models such as a partially correlated environment. In order to verify our scheme, we apply a recently developed quantum algorithm to simulate the quantum dynamics of our proposal and show that it outperforms the other proposals with less resources.

TI A RISC-V Post Quantum Cryptography Instruction Set Extension for Number
   Theoretic Transform to Speed-Up CRYSTALS Algorithms
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB In recent years, public-key cryptography has become a fundamental component of digital infrastructures. Such a scenario has to face a new and increasing threat, represented by quantum computers. It is well known that quantum computers in the next years will be able to run algorithms capable of breaking the security of currently widespread cryptographic schemes used for public-key cryptography. Post-quantum cryptography aims to define and execute algorithms on classical computer architectures, able to withstand attacks from quantum computers. The National Institute of Standards and Technology is currently running a selection process to define one or more quantum-resistant public-key algorithms and lattice-based cryptographic constructions are considered one of the leading candidates. However, such algorithms require non-negligible computational resources to be executed. One viable solution is to accelerate them totally or partially in hardware, to alleviate the workload of the main processing unit. In this paper, we investigate a solution trading-off performance and complexity to execute the lattice-based algorithms CRYSTALS-Kyber and -Dilithium: we introduce a dedicated Post-Quantum Arithmetic Logic Unit, embedded directly in the pipeline of a RISC-V processor. This results in an almost negligible area overhead with a large impact on the algorithms speed-up and a consistent reduction in the energy required per single operation.

TI Towards provably efficient quantum algorithms for large-scale
   machine-learning models
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Large machine learning models are revolutionary technologies of artificial intelligence whose bottlenecks include huge computational expenses, power, and time used both in the pre-training and fine-tuning process. In this work, we show that fault-tolerant quantum computing could possibly provide provably efficient resolutions for generic (stochastic) gradient descent algorithms, scaling as O(T-2 x polylog(n)), where n is the size of the models and T is the number of iterations in the training, as long as the models are both sufficiently dissipative and sparse, with small learning rates. Based on earlier efficient quantum algorithms for dissipative differential equations, we find and prove that similar algorithms work for (stochastic) gradient descent, the primary algorithm for machine learning. In practice, we benchmark instances of large machine learning models from 7 million to 103 million parameters. We find that, in the context of sparse training, a quantum enhancement is possible at the early stage of learning after model pruning, motivating a sparse parameter download and re-upload scheme. Our work shows solidly that fault-tolerant quantum algorithms could potentially contribute to most state-of-the-art, large-scale machine-learning problems.

TI Environment induced dynamical quantum phase transitions in two-qubit
   Rabi model
SO COMMUNICATIONS PHYSICS
AB Quantum states beyond thermodynamic equilibrium represent fascinating and cutting-edge research. However, the behavior of dynamical quantum phase transitions in complex open quantum systems remains poorly understood. Here, using state-of-the-art numerical approaches, we show that by quenching the qubits-oscillator coupling in a dissipative two-qubit Rabi model, the system undergoes dynamical quantum phase transitions. These transitions are characterized by kinks in the Loschmidt echo rate function at parameter values close to a thermodynamic quantum phase transition and are associated with distinct entanglement features. The two classes of critical phenomena depend on qubit interactions and entanglement, revealing different behaviors of the critical exponent of the first kink of the Loschmidt echo for interacting versus non-interacting qubits. This research enhances our understanding of non-equilibrium quantum systems and offers potential applications in quantum sensing and metrology, as it examines how dynamical transitions can enhance the sensitivity of the Loschmidt echo to the quench parameters.
   Dynamical quantum phase transitions can be observed when time is treated as a control parameter in non-equilibrium quantum systems. The authors show that quenching the qubits-oscillator coupling in a dissipative two-qubit system leads to different transitions depending on interactions and entanglement, with promising applications in quantum sensing and metrology.

TI Room-temperature single-photon emitters in silicon nitride
SO SCIENCE ADVANCES
AB Single-photon emitters are essential in enabling several emerging applications in quantum information technology, quantum sensing, and quantum communication. Scalable photonic platforms capable of hosting intrinsic or embedded sources of single-photon emission are of particular interest for the realization of integrated quantum photonic circuits. Here, we report on the observation of room-temperature single-photon emitters in silicon nitride (SiN) films grown on silicon dioxide substrates. Photophysical analysis reveals bright (>10(5) counts/s), stable, linearly polarized, and pure quantum emitters in SiN films with a second-order autocorrelation function value at zero time delay g((2))(0) below 0.2 at room temperature. We suggest that the emission originates from a specific defect center in SiN because of the narrow wavelength distribution of the observed luminescence peak. Single-photon emitters in SiN have the potential to enable direct, scalable, and low-loss integration of quantum light sources with a well-established photonic on-chip platform.

TI Strategies for generating separable photon triplets in waveguides and
   ring resonators
SO QUANTUM SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB Photon triplet sources exhibit non-Gaussian features, a key property for applications in quantum computing and quantum information. However, spectral correlations can limit the performance and detection efficiency of these systems. Motivated by this observation, we present a theoretical analysis of the spectral properties of photon triplets generated through spontaneous third-order parametric down-conversion in photonic devices, and discuss strategies to quantify and minimize such correlations. We propose two approaches: dispersion engineering in waveguides and pump engineering in resonators. We apply these strategies in two realistic source designs, namely a high-index-contrast optical fiber and a silicon nitride microring resonator. Finally, we discuss detection strategies for probing non-Gaussian features of the triplet state. We find that it is feasible to achieve few-mode generation of photon triplets using state-of-the-art experimental systems, a crucial step toward practical applications of photon triplet sources in quantum technologies.

These emerging technologies provide disruptive influences to global commercial markets. These remarkable advances in quantum technologies are nearly always enabled by the discovery of materials and their quantum behaviors. Such advances are governed by quantum principles that are strongly influenced by environmental, physical, topological, and morphological conditions such as very small length scales, short time durations, ultrahigh pressures, ultralow temperatures, etc., which lead to quantum behaviors that manifest as quantum tunneling, entanglement, superpositioning, superfluidity, low-dimensional, high-temperature and high-pressure superconductivity, quantum fluctuations, Bose-Einstein condensates, topological effects, and other phenomena that are not yet fully understood nor adequately explored. Here, we provide a review of quantum materials developed up to 2023. Remarkable advances in quantum materials occur daily, and therefore, by the time of publication, new and exciting breakthroughs will have occurred that are regrettably not covered herein.

TI Photonic Source of Heralded Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger States
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB Generating large multiphoton entangled states is of main interest due to enabling universal photonic quantum computing and all -optical quantum repeater nodes. These applications exploit measurementbased quantum computation using cluster states. Remarkably, it was shown that photonic cluster states of arbitrary size can be generated by using feasible heralded linear optics fusion gates that act on heralded three -photon Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) states as the initial resource state. Thus, the capability of generating heralded GHZ states is of great importance for scaling up photonic quantum computing. Here, we experimentally demonstrate this required building block by reporting a polarisation -encoded heralded GHZ state of three photons, for which we build a high -rate six -photon source (547 +/- 2 Hz) from a solidstate quantum emitter and a stable polarization -based interferometer. The detection of three ancillary photons heralds the generation of three -photon GHZ states among the remaining particles with fidelities up to F = 0.7278 +/- 0.0106. Our results initiate a path for scalable entangling operations using heralded linear -optics implementations.

TI A gate-tunable graphene Josephson parametric amplifier
SO NATURE NANOTECHNOLOGY
AB With a large portfolio of elemental quantum components, superconducting quantum circuits have contributed to advances in microwave quantum optics(1). Of these elements, quantum-limited parametric amplifiers(2-4) are essential for low noise readout of quantum systems whose energy range is intrinsically low (tens of mu eV)(5,6). They are also used to generate non-classical states of light that can be a resource for quantum enhanced detection(7). Superconducting parametric amplifiers, such as quantum bits, typically use a Josephson junction as a source of magnetically tunable and dissipation-free non-linearity. In recent years, efforts have been made to introduce semiconductor weak links as electrically tunable non-linear elements, with demonstrations of microwave resonators and quantum bits using semiconductor nanowires(8,9), a two-dimensional electron gas(10), carbon nanotubes(11) and graphene(12,13). However, given the challenge of balancing non-linearity, dissipation, participation and energy scale, parametric amplifiers have not yet been implemented with a semiconductor weak link. Here, we demonstrate a parametric amplifier leveraging a graphene Josephson junction and show that its working frequency is widely tunable with a gate voltage. We report gain exceeding 20 dB and noise performance close to the standard quantum limit. Our results expand the toolset for electrically tunable superconducting quantum circuits. They also offer opportunities for the development of quantum technologies such as quantum computing, quantum sensing and for fundamental science(14).

TI ARQUIN : Architectures for Multinode Superconducting Quantum Computers
SO ACM TRANSACTIONS ON QUANTUM COMPUTING
AB Many proposals to scale quantum technology rely on modular or distributed designs wherein individual quantum processors, called nodes, are linked together to form one large multinode quantum computer (MNQC). One scalable method to construct an MNQC is using superconducting quantum systems with optical interconnects. However, internode gates in these systems may be two to three orders of magnitude noisier and slower than local operations. Surmounting the limitations of internode gates will require improvements in entanglement generation, use of entanglement distillation, and optimized software and compilers. Still, it remains unclear what performance is possible with current hardware and what performance algorithms require. In this article, we employ a systems analysis approach to quantify overall MNQC performance in terms of hardware models of internode links, entanglement distillation, and local architecture. We show how to navigate tradeoffs in entanglement generation and distillation in the context of algorithm performance, lay out how compilers and software should balance between local and internode gates, and discuss when noisy quantum internode links have an advantage over purely classical links. We find that a factor of 10-100x better link performance is required and introduce a research roadmap for the co-design of hardware and software towards the realization of early MNQCs. While we focus on superconducting devices with optical interconnects, our approach is general across MNQC implementations.

TI Reducing T-Count in Quantum Circuits Using Alternate Forms of the
   Relative Phase Toffoli Gate
SO IEICE TRANSACTIONS ON FUNDAMENTALS OF ELECTRONICS COMMUNICATIONS AND
   COMPUTER SCIENCES
AB Toffoli gates are an important primitive in reversible Boolean logic. In quantum computation, these Toffoli gates are composed using other elementary gates, most notably the Clifford+T basis. However, in fault-tolerant implementations of quantum circuits, the T-gate incurs extra cost relative to Clifford gates like the S-gate and CNOT gate. Relative-phase Toffoli Gates (RTOFs) have been proposed as a way to reduce this T-count at the cost of incurring a relative phase that could skew the final quantum states. In this paper, we utilize an observation that the relative phase which RTOFs introduce can be canceled by the appropriate application of less expensive S-gates instead of T-gates. It leverages alternate forms of the RTOF including incorporating S-gates into it or moving around its input bits in order to simplify the logic to erase the relative phase. We find experimentally that our method has a clear advantage in most cases, and identify several types of circuits that it could be synergistic with.

TI Precision polarization tuning for light shift mitigation in trapped-ion
   qubits
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Trapped-ion qubits are among the most promising candidates for quantum computing, quantum information processing, and quantum simulation. In general, trapped ions are considered to have sufficiently long coherence times, which are mainly characterized under laser-free conditions. However, in reality, essential laser fields for quantum manipulation introduce residual light shift, which seriously degrades the coherence due to power fluctuations. Here, we present a comprehensive study of ac Stark shifts in the hyperfine energy levels of the 171Yb+ ion, revealing an asymmetric light shift between two circular polarizations in the clock qubit and pronounced vector light shifts in the Zeeman qubits. By precisely tuning these polarizations, a remarkable enhancement in coherence time is observed, reaching over a 100-fold for the clock qubit and more than 10-fold for the Zeeman qubits, when comparing conditions of maximum and minimum shifts. These findings advance the practical realization of scalable trapped-ion quantum processors, enabling deep quantum circuit execution and long-duration adiabatic operations.

TI Spontaneous Raman scattering out of a metastable atomic qubit
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Metastable qubits in atomic systems can enable large-scale quantum computing by simplifying hardware requirements and adding efficient erasure conversion to the preexisting toolbox of high-fidelity laser-based control. For trapped atomic ions, the fundamental error floor of this control is given by spontaneous Raman and Rayleigh scattering from short-lived excited states. We measure spontaneous Raman scattering rates out of a metastable D5/2 qubit manifold of a single trapped 40Ca+ ion illuminated by 976 nm light that is-44 THz detuned from the dipole-allowed transition to the P3/2 manifold. This supports the calculation of error rates from both types of scattering during one-and two-qubit gates on this platform, thus demonstrating that infidelities less than 10-4 are possible.

TI Polarization Control in Integrated Graphene-Silicon Quantum Photonics
   Waveguides
SO MATERIALS
AB We numerically investigated the use of graphene nanoribbons placed on top of silicon-on-insulator (SOI) strip waveguides for light polarization control in silicon photonic-integrated waveguides. We found that two factors mainly affected the polarization control: the graphene chemical potential and the geometrical parameters of the waveguide, such as the waveguide and nanoribbon widths and distance. We show that the graphene chemical potential influences both TE and TM polarizations almost in the same way, while the waveguide width tapering enables both TE-pass and TM-pass polarizing functionalities. Overall, by increasing the oxide spacer thickness between the silicon waveguide and the top graphene layer, the device insertion losses can be reduced, while preserving a high polarization extinction ratio.

TI Indistinguishable photons from an artificial atom in silicon photonics
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Silicon is the ideal material for building electronic and photonic circuits at scale. Integrated photonic quantum technologies in silicon offer a promising path to scaling by leveraging advanced semiconductor manufacturing and integration capabilities. However, the lack of deterministic quantum light sources and strong photon-photon interactions in silicon poses a challenge to scalability. In this work, we demonstrate an indistinguishable photon source in silicon photonics based on an artificial atom. We show that a G center in a silicon waveguide can generate high-purity telecom-band single photons. We perform high-resolution spectroscopy and time-delayed two-photon interference to demonstrate the indistinguishability of single photons emitted from a G center in a silicon waveguide. Our results show that artificial atoms in silicon photonics can source single photons suitable for photonic quantum networks and processors.
   Silicon is a very convenient platform for quantum photonic sources. Here, the authors realise an indistinguishable single-photon source in silicon photonics based on an artificial atom, performing high-resolution spectroscopy and time-delayed two-photon interference to probe the coherence of emitted photons.

TI Three-qubit-embedded split Cayley hexagon is contextuality sensitive
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB In this article, we show that sets of three-qubit quantum observables obtained by considering both the classical and skew embeddings of the split Cayley hexagon of order two into the binary symplectic polar space of rank three can be used to detect quantum state-independent contextuality. This reveals a fundamental connection between these two appealing structures and some fundamental tools in quantum mechanics and quantum computation. More precisely, we prove that the complement of a classically embedded hexagon does not provide a Mermin-Peres-like proof of the Kochen-Specker theorem whereas that of a skewly-embedded one does.

TI Quantum Algorithms for the Pathwise Lasso
SO QUANTUM
AB We present a novel quantum high-dimensional linear regression algorithm with an & ell;1-penalty based on the classical LARS (Least Angle Regression) pathwise algorithm. Similarly to available classical numerical algorithms for Lasso, our quantum algorithm provides the full regularisation path as the penalty term varies, but quadratically faster per iteration under specific conditions. A quadratic speedup on the number of features/predictors d is possible by using the simple quantum minimum-finding subroutine from D & uuml;rr and H & oslash;yer (arXiv'96) in order to obtain the joining time at each iteration. We then improve upon this simple quantum algorithm and obtain a quadratic speedup both in the number of features d and the number of observations n by using the approximate quantum minimum-finding subroutine from Chen and de Wolf (ICALP'23). In order to do so, we construct a quantum unitary based on quantum amplitude estimation to approximately compute the joining times to be searched over by the approximate quantum minimum-finding subroutine. Since the joining times are no longer exactly computed, it is no longer clear that the resulting approximate quantum algorithm obtains a good solution. As another main contribution, we prove, via an approximate version of the KKT conditions and a duality gap, that the LARS algorithm (and therefore our quantum algorithm) is robust to errors. This means that it still outputs a path that minimises the Lasso cost function up to a small error if the joining times are only approximately computed. Furthermore, we show that, when the observations are sampled from a Gaussian distribution, our quantum algorithm's complexity only depends polylogarithmically on n, exponentially better than the classical LARS algorithm, while keeping the quadratic improvement on d. Moreover, we propose a dequantised version of our quantum algorithm that also retains the polylogarithmic dependence on n, albeit presenting the linear scaling on d from the standard LARS algorithm. Finally, we prove query lower bounds for classical and quantum Lasso algorithms.

TI Expediting population diversification in evolutionary computation with

SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF BIO-INSPIRED COMPUTATION
AB Quantum computing's uniqueness in commencing parallel computation renders unprecedented efficient optimisation as possible. This paper introduces the adaptation of quantum processing to crowding, one of the genetic algorithmic procedures to secure undeveloped individual chromosomes in pursuit of diversifying the target population. We argue that the nature of genetic algorithm to find the best solution in the process of optimisation can be greatly enhanced by the capability of quantum computing to perform multiple computations in parallel. By introducing the relevant quantum mathematics based on Grover's selection algorithm and constructing its mechanism in a quantum simulator, we come to conclusion that our proposed approach is valid in such a way that it can precisely reduce the amount of computation query to finish the crowding process without any impairment in the middle of genetic operations.

TI Temporal Modes of Light in Satellite-to-Earth Quantum Communications
SO IEEE COMMUNICATIONS LETTERS
AB The photonic Temporal Mode (TM) represents a possible candidate for the delivery of viable multidimensional quantum communications. However, relative to other multidimensional quantum information carriers such as the Orbital Angular Momentum (OAM), the TM has received less attention. Moreover, in the context of the emerging quantum internet and satellite-based quantum communications, the TM has received no attention. In this work, we remedy this situation by considering the traversal through the satellite-to-Earth channel of single photons encoded in TM space. Our results indicate that for anticipated atmospheric conditions the photonic TM offers a promising avenue for the delivery of high-throughput quantum communications from a satellite to a terrestrial receiver. In particular, we show how these modes can provide for improved multiplexing performance and superior quantum key distribution in the satellite-to-Earth channel, relative to OAM single-photon states. The levels of TM discrimination that guarantee this outcome are outlined and implications of our results for the emerging satellite-based quantum internet are discussed.

TI Superconducting quantum computing optimization based on multi-objective
   deep reinforcement learning
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB Deep reinforcement learning is considered an effective technology in quantum optimization and can provide strategies for optimal control of complex quantum systems. More precise measurements require simulation control at multiple experimental stages. Based on this, we improved a multi-objective deep reinforcement learning method in mathematical convex optimization theory for multi-process quantum optimal control optimization. By setting the single-process quantum control optimization result as a multi-objective optimization truncation threshold and reward function transfer strategy, we finally gave a global optimal solution that considers multiple influencing factors, rather than a local optimal solution that only targets a certain error. This method achieved excellent computational results on superconducting qubits. Optimum control of multi-process quantum computing can be achieved only by regulating the microwave pulse parameters of superconducting qubits, and such a set of global parameter values and control strategies are given.

AB Dynamically field-programmable qubit arrays based on neutral atoms feature high fidelity and highly parallel gates for quantum computing. However, it is challenging for compilers to fully leverage the novel flexibility offered by such hardware while respecting its various constraints. In this study, we break down the compilation for this architecture into three tasks: scheduling, placement, and routing. We formulate these three problems and present efficient solutions to them. Notably, our scheduling based on graph edge-coloring is provably near-optimal in terms of the number of two-qubit gate stages (at most one more than the optimum). As a result, our compiler, Enola, reduces this number of stages by 3.7x and improves the fidelity by 5.9x compared to OLSQ-DPQA, the current state of the art. Additionally, Enola is highly scalable, e.g., within 30 minutes, it can compile circuits with 10,000 qubits, a scale sufficient for the current era of quantum computing. Enola is open source at https://github.com/UCLA-VAST/Enola

TI QuCloud plus : A Holistic Qubit Mapping Scheme for
   Single/Multi-programming on 2D/3D NISQ Quantum Computers
SO ACM TRANSACTIONS ON ARCHITECTURE AND CODE OPTIMIZATION
AB Qubit mapping for NISQ superconducting quantum computers is essential to fidelity and resource utilization. The existing qubit mapping schemes meet challenges, e.g., crosstalk, SWAP overheads, diverse device topologies, etc., leading to qubit resource underutilization and low fidelity in computing results. This article introduces QuCloud+, a new qubit mapping scheme that tackles these challenges. QuCloud+ has several new designs. (1) QuCloud+ supports single/multi-programming quantum computing on quantum chips with 2D/3D topology. (2) QuCloud+ partitions physical qubits for concurrent quantum programs with the crosstalk-aware community detection technique and further allocates qubits according to qubit degree, improving fidelity, and resource utilization. (3) QuCloud+ includes an X-SWAP mechanism that avoids SWAPs with high crosstalk errors and enables inter-program SWAPs to reduce the SWAP overheads. (4) QuCloud+ schedules concurrent quantum programs to be mapped and executed based on estimated fidelity for the best practice. Experimental results show that, compared with the existing typical multi-programming study [12], QuCloud+ achieves up to 9.03% higher fidelity and saves on the required SWAPs during mapping, reducing the number of CNOT gates inserted by 40.92%. Compared with a recent study [30] that enables post-mapping gate optimizations to further reduce gates, QuCloud+ reduces the post-mapping circuit depth by 21.91% while using a similar number of gates.

TI Uniform instruction set extensions for multiplications in contemporary
   and post-quantum cryptography
SO JOURNAL OF CRYPTOGRAPHIC ENGINEERING
AB Hybrid key encapsulation is in the process of becoming the de-facto standard for integration of post-quantum cryptography (PQC). Supporting two cryptographic primitives is a challenging task for constrained embedded systems. Both contemporary cryptography based on elliptic curves or RSA and PQC based on lattices require costly multiplications. Recent works have shown how to implement lattice-based cryptography on big-integer coprocessors. We propose a novel hardware design that natively supports the multiplication of polynomials and big integers, integrate it into a RISC-V core, and extend the RISC-V ISA accordingly. We provide an implementation of Saber and X25519 to demonstrate that both lattice- and elliptic-curve-based cryptography benefits from our extension. Our implementation requires only intermediate logic overhead, while significantly outperforming optimized ARM Cortex M4 implementations, other hardware/software codesigns, and designs that rely on contemporary accelerators.

AB Multipartite entanglement is a crucial resource for a wide range of quantum information processing tasks, including quantum metrology, quantum computing, and quantum communication. The verification of multipartite entanglement, along with an understanding of its intrinsic structure, is of fundamental importance, both for the foundations of quantum mechanics and for the practical applications of quantum information technologies. Nonetheless, detecting entanglement structures remains a significant challenge, particularly for general states and large-scale quantum systems. To address this issue, an efficient algorithm that combines semidefinite programming with a gradient descent method is developed. This algorithm is designed to explore the entanglement structure by examining the inner polytope of the convex set that encompasses all states sharing the same entanglement properties. Through detailed examples, it is demonstrated that the superior performance of this approach compared to many of the best-known methods available today. This method not only improves entanglement detection but also provides deeper insights into the complex structures of many-body quantum systems, which is essential for advancing quantum technologies.

TI Bridging Deep Learning and Quantum Computing for EEG-Driven P300
   Targeted ASD Response Detection
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental condition whose diagnosis relies heavily on subjective behavioral assessments. Electroencephalography (EEG) provides an inexpensive and non-invasive method of objective biomarker detection, but is plagued by high dimensionality and noise that complicates automated analysis. This article introduces a hybrid Transformer-Quantum Neural Network (QNN) model that combines deep learning and quantum computing to enhance P300 targeted ASD responses from non-targeted responses. The model uses transformer capabilities to capture cross-domain correlations and feature-level dependencies across heterogeneous feature sources, and the quantum heads introduced via parameterized quantum circuits detect high-order, nonlinear relations in a Hilbert space via entanglement and superposition. Experimental results on the BCIAUT-P300 dataset better pure classical alternatives with higher diagnostic accuracy at higher accuracy (0.921) and F1-score (0.915). Statistical comparisons confirm that the hybrid approach yields significant improvements in discriminative reliability and diagnostic odds ratio, justifying quantum feature embedding's expressivity and efficiency. The results bear witness to the feasibility and potential of hybrid quantum-classical systems as potential future intelligent diagnostic devices for ASD responses from EEG signals.

TI QCAE-QOC-SVM: A hybrid quantum machine learning model for DoS and Fuzzy
   attack detection on autonomous vehicle CAN bus
SO METHODSX
AB In this study, we introduce a hybrid quantum machine learning method to identify Normal signal, DoS, and Fuzzy attacks on the CAN bus utilized in autonomous vehicles. Our approach is a combination of a Quantum Convolutional Autoencoder (QCAE) and a Quantum Orthogonal Classifier based on Support Vector Machines (QOC-SVM). The method effectively extracts patterns from CAN bus traffic with the help of quantum-powered classification for accurate anomaly detection. The model was assessed using a public and custom dataset of 300,000 instances generated through the CARLA simulator and was run on a high-performance computing facility. Results from the experiments show that the QCAE-QOC-SVM model performs better than conventional machine learning (ML), deep learning (DL), and other quantum machine learning (QML) models with an F1 score of 99.43 % when the batches-to-batch size ratio is 7741:31. These findings indicate the possibility of quantum machine learning to significantly improve strong defense mechanisms against cyber-attacks for intelligent transportation systems. The high accuracy and resistance of the model proposed indicate good prospects for real-time autonomous vehicle security, with enhanced detection of sophisticated attack patterns. Our contribution is substantial in the creation of future-proof cybersecurity solutions for the fast-changing autonomous vehicle technology and intelligent transportation system domain. center dot Introduction of a hybrid quantum machine learning model for attack detection on autonomous vehicle CAN buses. center dot Demonstrated superior performance with an F1 score of 99.43 % compared to traditional ML, DL, and QML models. center dot Showed the potential of quantum machine learning in strengthening defense systems for intelligent transportation networks.

SO NUCLEAR PHYSICS B
AB We obtain two series of spectral parameter dependent solutions to the generalized Yang-Baxter equations (GYBE), for definite types of N12 x N22 matrices with general dimensions N1 and N2. Appropriate extensions are presented for the inhomogeneous GYBEs. The first series of the solutions includes as particular cases the X-shaped trigonometric braiding matrices. For construction of the second series the colored and graded permutation operators are defined, and multi-spectral parameter Yang-Baxterization is performed. For some examples the corresponding integrable models are discussed. The unitary solutions existing in these two series can be considered as generalizations of the multipartite Bell matrices in the quantum information theory.(c) 2023 The Author(s).

TI A single-qubit position verification protocol that is secure against
   multi-qubit attacks
SO NATURE PHYSICS
AB The position of a device or agent is an important security credential in today's society, both online and in the real world. Unless in direct proximity, however, the secure verification of a position is impossible without further assumptions. This is true classically(1), but also in any future quantum-equipped communications infrastructure(2). We show in this work that minimal quantum resources, in the form of a single qubit, combined with classical communication are sufficient to thwart quantum adversaries that pretend to be at a specific position and have the ability to coordinate their action with entanglement. More precisely, we show that adversaries using an increasing amount of entanglement can be combatted solely by increasing the number of classical bits used in the protocol. The presented protocols are noise-robust and within reach of current quantum technology.

TI Demonstrating Shareability of Multipartite Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen
   Steering
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR) steering, a category of quantum nonlocal correlations describing the ability of one observer to influence another party's state via local measurements, is different from both entanglement and Bell nonlocality by possessing an asymmetric property. For multipartite EPR steering, the monogamous situation, where two observers cannot simultaneously steer the state of the third party, has been investigated rigorously both in theory and experiment. In contrast to the monogamous situation, the shareability of EPR steering in reduced subsystems allows the state of one party to be steered by two or more observers and thus reveals more configurations of multipartite EPR steering. However, the experimental implementation of such a kind of shareability has still been absent until now. Here, in an optical experiment, we provide a proof-of-principle demonstration of the shareability of EPR steering without the constraint of monogamy in a three-qubit system. Moreover, based on the reduced bipartite EPR steering detection results, we verify the genuine three-qubit entanglement results. This work provides a complementary viewpoint for understanding multipartite EPR steering and has potential applications in many quantum information protocols, such as multipartite entanglement detection, quantum cryptography, and the construction of quantum networks.

TI Quantum-Inspired Classification Algorithm from DBSCAN-Deutsch-Jozsa
   Support Vectors and Ising Prediction Model
SO APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL
AB Quantum computing is suggested as a new tool to deal with large data set for machine learning applications. However, many quantum algorithms are too expensive to fit into the small-scale quantum hardware available today and the loading of big classical data into small quantum memory is still an unsolved obstacle. These difficulties lead to the study of quantum-inspired techniques using classical computation. In this work, we propose a new classification method based on support vectors from a DBSCAN-Deutsch-Jozsa ranking and an Ising prediction model. The proposed algorithm has an advantage over standard classical SVM in the scaling with respect to the number of training data at the training phase. The method can be executed in a pure classical computer and can be accelerated in a hybrid quantum-classical computing environment. We demonstrate the applicability of the proposed algorithm with simulations and theory.

TI A Monte Carlo Tree Search approach to QAOA: finding a needle in the
   haystack
SO NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB The search for quantum algorithms to tackle classical combinatorial optimization problems has long been one of the most attractive yet challenging research topics in quantum computing. In this context, variational quantum algorithms (VQAs) are a promising family of hybrid quantum-classical methods tailored to cope with the limited capability of near-term quantum hardware. However, their effectiveness is hampered by the complexity of the classical parameter optimization which is prone to getting stuck either in local minima or in flat regions of the cost-function landscape. The clever design of efficient optimization methods is therefore of fundamental importance for fully leveraging the potential of VQAs. In this work, we approach parameter optimization as a sequential decision-making problem and tackle it with an adaptation of Monte Carlo Tree Search, a powerful artificial intelligence technique designed for efficiently exploring complex decision graphs. We show that leveraging regular parameter patterns deeply affects the decision-tree structure and allows for a flexible and noise-resilient optimization strategy suitable for near-term quantum devices. Our results shed further light on the interplay between artificial intelligence and quantum information and provide a valuable addition to the toolkit of variational quantum circuits.

TI Emergent hydrodynamic mode on SU(2) plaquette chains and quantum
   simulation
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW D
AB We search for emergent hydrodynamic modes in real-time Hamiltonian dynamics of 2 + 1-dimensional SU(2) lattice gauge theory on a quasi-one-dimensional plaquette chain, by numerically computing symmetric correlation functions of energy densities on lattice sizes of about 20 with the local Hilbert space truncated at jmax 1/4 12. Because of the Umklapp processes, we only find a mode for energy diffusion. The symmetric correlator exhibits transport peak near zero frequency with a width approximately proportional to momentum squared at small momentum, when the system is fully quantum ergodic, as indicated by the eigenenergy level statistics. This transport peak leads to a power-law t-12 decay of the symmetric correlator at late time, also known as the long-time tail, as well as diffusionlike spreading in position space. We also introduce a quantum algorithm for computing the symmetric correlator on a quantum computer and find it gives results consistent with exact diagonalization when tested on the IBM emulator. Finally we discuss the future prospect of searching for the sound modes.

TI Clustering and enhanced classification using a hybrid quantum
   autoencoder
SO QUANTUM SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB Quantum machine learning (QML) is a rapidly growing area of research at the intersection of classical machine learning and quantum information theory. One area of considerable interest is the use of QML to learn information contained within quantum states themselves. In this work, we propose a novel approach in which the extraction of information from quantum states is undertaken in a classical representational-space, obtained through the training of a hybrid quantum autoencoder (HQA). Hence, given a set of pure states, this variational QML algorithm learns to identify-and classically represent-their essential distinguishing characteristics, subsequently giving rise to a new paradigm for clustering and semi-supervised classification. The analysis and employment of the HQA model are presented in the context of amplitude encoded states-which in principle can be extended to arbitrary states for the analysis of structure in non-trivial quantum data sets.

TI Quantum Channel Optimization: Integrating Quantum-Inspired Machine
   Learning With Genetic Adaptive Strategies
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB There is an ever-growing need for optimizing efficient nano and quantum communication systems and this demand calls for more advanced optimization techniques than those that have been around for quite some time. The conventional genetic algorithms (GAs) proved to be quite helpful in general but proved to be poor when it comes to fast convergence and adaptability to the changing communication environment. Moreover, fault tolerance and resource efficiency in these communication channels are poorly addressed, giving rise to a huge roadblock to practical implementations in a number of different use cases. This research presents a set of novel hybrid optimization methods aimed at addressing the issues previously mentioned. In the first place, a Quantum-inspired Genetic Algorithm (QIGA) with Simulated Annealing (SA) Initialization is proposed through augmenting traditional genetic operations with the quantum computing paradigm. In the first instance, the hybrid approach works by utilizing the parameters derived from SA while initializing the GA population, hence effective exploration of solution space. Additionally, the Adaptive Genetic Algorithm with Reinforcement Learning (AGA-RL) is presented, which uses real-time feedback from the current environment to modify the GA parameters. This way, the system will be much more adaptive and hence be able to adjust the GA so that it can match the rapidly changing channel conditions. Simultaneously, the Fault-Tolerant Genetic Algorithm with Error-Correcting Codes (FTGA-ECC) is developed to ensure reliable data transmission, especially in an error-prone environment. To make up for resource constraints, the Energy-Aware Genetic Algorithm with Dynamic Resource Allocation (EAGA-DRA) strategy ensures that resources are well-managed by dynamically changing allocation based on the optimization process and the particular needs of the channel, hence reducing energy overhead and spatial overhead without compromising channel quality. A great leap is in the integration of Machine Learning through the Deep Reinforcement Learning-guided Genetic Algorithm (DRL-GA). The above approach exploits deep reinforcement learning to fine-tune the exploration and exploitation strategies of the GA, hence providing faster convergence and improved solution quality. All of these methods are validated by the Quantum-inspired Benchmarking Framework (QIBF), which forms a systematized comparative platform to evaluate different optimization techniques from the perspective of QCA-based communication systems. The above approaches not only provide the improvement in efficiency and reliability but also contribute to enhancing the adaptability of communication systems and provide a very good base for future research and development in the field of quantum communications and beyond, with potential applications extending to secure communication, quantum computing, and nanotechnology-based devices & scenarios. This work is multifold, promising significant advancements in the field of quantum communication and beyond. The empirical findings showed that the suggested algorithms perform significantly better than traditional approaches in several important performance metrics, such as robustness to channel errors, adaptability to changing signal-to-noise ratios, convergence speed under dynamic conditions, and solution quality in highly variable environments.INDEX TERMS Quantum-inspired genetic algorithm, adaptive genetic algorithm, fault-tolerance, energy-efficient optimization, deep reinforcement learning.

AB Quantum entanglement swapping is one of the most promising quantum techniques to create or manipulate large-scale multi-mode entanglement between two distant quantum entangled systems. In this work, a scheme for the generation of three-mode entanglement based on parametric amplifiers using quantum entanglement swapping has been proposed. The newly generated three-mode entanglement is always present in the whole power gain region from parametric amplifiers and its dependence on transmission loss and feedforward gain is also investigated. In addition, the effects of power gain, transmission loss, and feedforward gain on the two-mode entanglement of the three pairs in the newly generated three-mode entanglement have also been analysed in detail. The results presented here may find some practical applications in quantum secure communication.

TI Scalable and effective multi-level entangled photon states: a promising
   tool to boost quantum technologies
SO NANOPHOTONICS
AB Multi-level (qudit) entangled photon states are a key resource for both fundamental physics and advanced applied science, as they can significantly boost the capabilities of novel technologies such as quantum communications, cryptography, sensing, metrology, and computing. The benefits of using photons for advanced applications draw on their unique properties: photons can propagate over long distances while preserving state coherence, and they possess multiple degrees of freedom (such as time and frequency) that allow scalable access to higher dimensional state encoding, all while maintaining low platform footprint and complexity. In the context of out of-lab use, photon generation and processing through integrated devices and off-the-shelf components are in high demand. Similarly, multi-level entanglement detection must be experimentally practical, i.e., ideally requiring feasible single-qudit projections and high noise tolerance. Here, we focus on multi-level optical Bell and cluster states as a critical resource for quantum technologies, as well as on universal witness operators for their feasible detection and entanglement characterization. Time-and frequency-entangled states are the main platform considered in this context. We review a promising approach for the scalable, cost-effective generation and processing of these states by using integrated quantum frequency combs and fiber-based devices, respectively. We finally report an experimentally practical entanglement identification and characterization technique based on witness operators that is valid for any complex photon state and provides a good compromise between experimental feasibility and noise robustness. The results reported here can pave the way toward boosting the implementation of quantum technologies in integrated and widely accessible photonic platforms.

Considering extensive QKD implementations of trusted node networks, a workable upgrading tactic of existing networks toward MDI networks needs to be explicit.

Our solution can upgrade the BB84 networks and terminals that employ various phase-encoding schemes to immediately support MDI without hardware changes. This cost-effective upgrade effectively promotes the deployment of MDI networks as a step of untrusted node networks while taking full advantage of existing networks. In addition, the diversified demands on security and bandwidth are satisfied, and network survivability is improved. (C) 2021 Chinese Laser Press

TI High-Dimensional Quantum Key Distribution in Quantum Access Networks
SO IEEE PHOTONICS JOURNAL
AB We investigate the use of high-dimensional quantum key distribution (HD-QKD) for wireless access to hybrid quantum-classical networks. We use $d$-dimensional time-phase encoded states to exchange a secret key between an indoor wireless user and the central office on the other end of the access network. We evaluate the performance in the case of transmitting quantum and classical signals over the same passive optical network by accounting for the impact of background noise induced by the Raman-scattered light on the QKD receiver. We also take into account the loss and background noise that occur in indoor environments as well as finite key effects in our analysis. By studying the system under nominal simulation conditions, we identify regimes of operation in which an HD-QKD system with d=4 can outperform its qubit-based counterpart.

TI Benchmarking Quantum Annealing Controls with Portfolio Optimization
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW APPLIED
AB Quantum annealing offers an approach to finding the optimal solutions for a variety of computational problems, where the quantum annealing controls influence the observed performance and error mechanisms by tuning the underlying quantum dynamics. However, the influence of the available controls is often poorly understood, and methods for evaluating the effects of these controls are necessary to tune quantum computational performance. Here we use portfolio optimization as a case study by which to benchmark quantum annealing controls and their relative effects on computational accuracy. We compare empirical results from the D-Wave 2000Q (TM) quantum annealer to the computational ground truth for a variety of portfolio optimization instances. We evaluate both forward and reverse annealing methods and we identify control variations that yield optimal performance in terms of probability of success and probability of chain breaks.

AB The advancement of technology in Quantum Computing has brought possibilities for the execution of algorithms in real quantum devices. However, the existing errors in the current quantum hardware and the low number of available qubits make it necessary to use solutions that use fewer qubits and fewer operations, mitigating such obstacles. Hadamard Classifier (HC) is a distance-based quantum machine learning model for pattern recognition. We present a new classifier based on HC named Quantum One-class Classifier (QOCC) that consists of a minimal quantum machine learning model with fewer operations and qubits, thus being able to mitigate errors from NISQ (Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum) computers. Experimental results were obtained by running the proposed classifier on a quantum device and show that QOCC has advantages over HC.

TI Synthesis and Arithmetic of Single Qutrit Circuits
SO QUANTUM
AB In this paper we study single qutrit circuits consisting of words over the Clifford+D cyclotomic gate set, where D = diag(+/- a, +/- b, +/- c), is a primitive 9-th root of unity and a, b, c are integers. We characterize classes of qutrit unit vectors z with entries in Z[ , 1 chi] based on the possibility of reducing their smallest denominator exponent (sde) with respect to chi := 1 - , by acting an appropriate gate in Clifford+D. We do this by studying the notion of 'derivatives mod 3' of an arbitrary element of Z[ ] and using it to study the smallest denominator exponent of HDz where H is the qutrit Hadamard gate and D is an element of D. In addition, we reduce the problem of finding all unit vectors of a given sde to that of finding integral solutions of a positive definite quadratic form along with some additional constraints. As a consequence we prove that the Clifford+D gates naturally arise as gates with sde 0 and 3 in the group U(3, Z[ , 1 chi]) of 3 x 3 unitaries with entries in Z[ , 1 chi]. We illustrate the general applicability of these methods to obtain an exact synthesis algorithm for Clifford+R and recover the previous exact synthesis algorithm in [14]. The framework developed to formulate qutrit gate synthesis for Clifford+D extends to qudits of arbitrary prime power.

TI Symmetries of Quantum Fisher Information as Parameter Estimator for
   Pauli Channels under Indefinite Causal Order
SO SYMMETRY-BASEL
AB Quantum Fisher Information is considered in Quantum Information literature as the main resource to determine a bound in the parametric characterization problem of a quantum channel by means of probe states. The parameters characterizing a quantum channel can be estimated until a limited precision settled by the Cramer-Rao bound established in estimation theory and statistics. The involved Quantum Fisher Information of the emerging quantum state provides such a bound. Quantum states with dimension d = 2, the qubits, still comprise the main resources considered in Quantum Information and Quantum Processing theories. For them, Pauli channels are an important family of parametric quantum channels providing the most faithful deformation effects of imperfect quantum communication channels. Recently, Pauli channels have been characterized when they are arranged in an Indefinite Causal Order. Thus, their fidelity has been compared with single or sequential arrangements of identical channels to analyse their induced transparency under a joint behaviour. The most recent characterization has exhibited important features for quantum communication related with their parametric nature. In this work, a parallel analysis has been conducted to extended such a characterization, this time in terms of their emerging Quantum Fisher Information to pursue the advantages of each kind of arrangement for the parameter estimation problem. The objective is to reach the arrangement stating the best estimation bound for each type of Pauli channel. A complete map for such an effectivity is provided for each Pauli channel under the most affordable setups considering sequential and Indefinite Causal Order arrangements, as well as discussing their advantages and disadvantages.

TI Testing Bell inequalities and probing quantum entanglement at CEPC
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW D
AB We study quantum entanglement and test violation of Bell-type inequality at the Circular Electron Positron Collider (CEPC), which is one of the most attractive future collides. It is a promising particle collider designed to search new physics, make Standard Model (SM) precision measurements, and serving as a Higgs factory. Our study is based on a fast simulation of the Z boson pair production from Higgs boson ffidecay at p s= 250 GeV. The detector effects are also included in the simulation. The spin density matrix of the joint ZZ system is parametrized using irreducible tensor operators and reconstructed from the spherical coordinates of the decay leptons. To test Bell inequalities, we construct observable quantities for the H -* ZZ* process in CEPC by using the Collins-Gisin-Linden-Massar-Popescu (CGLMP) inequality, whose value is determined from the density matrix of the Z boson pairs. The sensitivity of the Bell inequality violation is observed with more than 16 and the presence of the quantum entanglement is probed with more than 26 confidence level.

TI Quantum-assisted associative adversarial network: applying quantum
   annealing in deep learning
SO QUANTUM MACHINE INTELLIGENCE
AB Generative models have the capacity to model and generate new examples from a dataset and have an increasingly diverse set of applications driven by commercial and academic interest. In this work, we present an algorithm for learning a latent variable generative model via generative adversarial learning where the canonical uniform noise input is replaced by samples from a graphical model. This graphical model is learned by a Boltzmann machine which learns low-dimensional feature representation of data extracted by the discriminator. A quantum processor can be used to sample from the model to train the Boltzmann machine. This novel hybrid quantum-classical algorithm joins a growing family of algorithms that use a quantum processor sampling subroutine in deep learning, and provides a scalable framework to test the advantages of quantum-assisted learning. For the latent space model, fully connected, symmetric bipartite and Chimera graph topologies are compared on a reduced stochastically binarized MNIST dataset, for both classical and quantum sampling methods. The quantum-assisted associative adversarial network successfully learns a generative model of the MNIST dataset for all topologies. Evaluated using the Frechet inception distance and inception score, the quantum and classical versions of the algorithm are found to have equivalent performance for learning an implicit generative model of the MNIST dataset. Classical sampling is used to demonstrate the algorithm on the LSUN bedrooms dataset, indicating scalability to larger and color datasets. Though the quantum processor used here is a quantum annealer, the algorithm is general enough such that any quantum processor, such as gate model quantum computers, may be substituted as a sampler.

We show that depending on how we design the weights and the feedback law, we can prepare the pth excited state or lowest energy states up to the pth excited state. Through an application in quantum chemistry, we show the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm, evaluating its efficacy via numerical simulations.

AB Excess micromotion is detrimental to accurate qubit control of trapped ions, thus measuring and minimizing it is crucial. In this paper, we present a simple approach for measuring and suppressing excess micromotion of trapped ions by leveraging the existing laser-driven qubit transition scheme combined with direct scanning of dc voltages. The compensation voltage is deduced by analyzing the Bessel expansion of a scanned qubit transition rate. The method provides a fair level of sensitivity for practical quantum computing applications, while demanding minimal deviation of trap condition. By accomplishing compensation of excess micromotion in the qubit momentum-excitation direction, the scheme offers an additional avenue for excess micromotion compensation, complementing existing compensation schemes.

   elementary operations
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Accurate quantum control is a key technology for realizing quantum information processing, such as quantum communication and quantum computation. In reality, a quantum state under control suffers from undesirable effects caused by systematic errors. A composite pulse (CP) is used to eliminate the effects of systematic errors during control. One-qubit control, which is the most fundamental in quantum control, is typically affected by two errors: pulse length error and off-resonance error (ORE). In this paper, we focus on ORE-robust CPs and systematically construct symmetric ones comprising three elementary operations in order to understand their properties. We find an infinitely large number of ORE-robust CPs, including the well-known CORPSE family, and evaluate their performance according to gate infidelity and operation time, both of which are important for the realization of accurate quantum control.

TI Propagation of errors and quantitative quantum simulation with quantum
   advantage
SO QUANTUM SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB The rapid development in hardware for quantum computing and simulation has led to much interest in problems where these devices can exceed the capabilities of existing classical computers and known methods. Approaching this for problems that go beyond testing the performance of a quantum device is an important step, and quantum simulation of many-body quench dynamics is one of the most promising candidates for early practical quantum advantage. We analyse the requirements for quantitatively reliable quantum simulation beyond the capabilities of existing classical methods for analogue quantum simulators with neutral atoms in optical lattices and trapped ions. Considering the primary sources of error in analogue devices and how they propagate after a quench in studies of the Hubbard or long-range transverse field Ising model, we identify the level of error expected in quantities we extract from experiments. We conclude for models that are directly implementable that regimes of practical quantum advantage are attained in current experiments with analogue simulators. We also identify the hardware requirements to reach the same level of accuracy with future fault-tolerant digital quantum simulation. Verification techniques are already available to test the assumptions we make here, and demonstrating these in experiments will be an important next step.

TI Remote chip-scale quantum sensing of magnetic fields
SO OPTICA QUANTUM
AB Quantum sensing is an ever-evolving research field describing the use of a quantum phenomenon to perform measurement of a physical quantity. Amongst different types of quantum sensors, atomic vapor-based quantum effects are extensively used to measure quantities such as time, velocity, acceleration, electric, and magnetic fields. Here, we propose and demonstrate remote quantum sensing using a chip-scale atomic vapor cell. Specifically, we remotely interrogate millimeter-scale micromachined vapor cells, and measure the ambient Earth's magnetic field at a standoff distance of-10 m and a sensitivity of-1 pT/root Hz. We further spatially map different magnetic fields in the presence of a noisy ambient environment. Simultaneously we are able measure the distance between a micro-cell and the interrogating system by means of time-of-flight measurements, thus correlating between position and magnetic field. Utilizing micromachined vapor cells for remote magnetometry offers substantial advantages in scalability, planar photonic integration, cost, and size. Consequently, we provide a novel toolset to deploy, measure, and map arbitrary, remote, and hard-to-access magnetic fields in unshielded environments with high sensitivity and spatial resolution, paving the way to a variety of novel applications in diverse fields such as medicine, communication, defense, space-exploration, and quantum technologies.

SO NANO LETTERS
AB Ultranarrow bandwidth single-photon sources operating at room-temperature are of vital importance for viable optical quantum technologies at scale, including quantum key distribution, cloud-based quantum information processing networks, and quantum metrology. Here we show a room-temperature ultranarrow bandwidth single-photon source generating single-mode photons at a rate of 5 MHz based on an inorganic CsPbI3 perovskite quantum dot embedded in a tunable open-access optical microcavity. When coupled to an optical cavity mode, the quantum dot room-temperature emission becomes single-mode, and the spectrum narrows down to just similar to 1 nm. The low numerical aperture of the optical cavities enables efficient collection of high-purity single-mode single-photon emission at room-temperature, offering promising performance for photonic and quantum technology applications. We measure 94% pure single-photon emission in a single-mode under pulsed and continuous-wave (CW) excitation.

TI Deterministic Quantum Dense Coding Based on Non-Maximal Entangled
   Channel
SO ENTROPY
AB In quantum communication, the concept of dense coding traditionally relies on maximally entangled states as quantum channels. Recent advancements have expanded this framework to include non-maximally entangled states within the probabilistic dense coding paradigm. However, such schemes introduce a significant limitation: the receiver cannot always retrieve the complete dense coding information sent by the sender. Consequently, the receiver must inform the sender of the amount of information successfully received. Based on this feedback, the sender determines whether retransmission is necessary, leading to inefficient use of the quantum channel and reduced communication efficiency. To address these shortcomings, we propose an alternative deterministic quantum dense coding scheme that utilizes non-maximally entangled states as the quantum channel. This deterministic approach eliminates the need for retransmissions and significantly enhances communication efficiency while maintaining compatibility with non-maximally entangled states. Our scheme represents a substantial improvement over existing probabilistic methods and paves the way for more efficient quantum communication protocols.

TI Genuine multipartite entanglement measures based on multi-party
   teleportation capability
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB Quantifying entanglement is vital to understand entanglement as a resource in quantum information processing, and many entanglement measures have been suggested for this purpose. When mathematically defining an entanglement measure, we should consider the distinguishability between entangled and separable states, the invariance under local transformation, the monotonicity under local operations and classical communication, and the convexity. These are reasonable requirements but may be insufficient, in particular when taking into account the usefulness of quantum states in multi-party quantum information processing. Therefore, if we want to investigate multipartite entanglement as a resource, then it can be necessary to consider the usefulness of quantum states in multi-party quantum information processing when we define a multipartite entanglement measure. In this paper, we define new multipartite entanglement measures for three-qubit systems based on the three-party teleportation capability, and show that these entanglement measures satisfy the requirements for being genuine multipartite entanglement measures. We also generalize our entanglement measures for N-qubit systems, where N >= 4, and discuss that these quantities may be good candidates to measure genuine multipartite entanglement.

TI Methods for Simulating String-Net States and Anyons on a Digital Quantum
   Computer
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB The finding of physical realizations of topologically ordered states in experimental settings, from condensed matter to artificial quantum systems, has been the main challenge en route to utilizing their unconventional properties. We show how to realize a large class of topologically ordered states and simulate their quasiparticle excitations on a digital quantum computer. To achieve this, we design a set of linear-depth quantum circuits to generate ground states of general string-net models together with unitary open-string operators to simulate the creation and braiding of Abelian and non-Abelian anyons. We show that the Abelian (non-Abelian) unitary string operators can be implemented with a constant- (linear) depth quantum circuit. Our scheme allows us to directly probe characteristic topological properties, including topological entanglement entropy, braiding statistics, and fusion channels of anyons. Moreover, this set of efficiently prepared topologically ordered states has potential applications in the development of fault-tolerant quantum computers.

TI Preparing exact eigenstates of the open XXZ chain on a quantum computer
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICS A-MATHEMATICAL AND THEORETICAL
AB The open spin-1/2 XXZ spin chain with diagonal boundary magnetic fields is the paradigmatic example of a quantum integrable model with open boundary conditions. We formulate a quantum algorithm for preparing Bethe states of this model, corresponding to real solutions of the Bethe equations. The algorithm is probabilistic, with a success probability that decreases with the number of down spins. For a Bethe state of L spins with M down spins, which contains a total of ((L)(M)) 2(M) M! terms, the algorithm requires L + M-2 + 2M qubits.

TI Optical reconstruction of the collective density matrix of a qutrit
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Reliable tomography of a quantum state of atoms in room-temperature vapors offers interesting applications in quantum-information science. To step toward the applications, here, we theoretical investigate a technique of reconstruction of a collective density matrix of atoms in a state of a total angular momentum equal to unity. By studying transformation of density matrix due to magnetic-field pulses and deriving explicit relations between optical signals and specific density-matrix elements, we demonstrate full reconstruction of quantum states. Numerical simulations allow us to demonstrate that the reconstruction fidelity of pure and mixed states may exceed 0.95 and that the technique is robust against noise and uncertainties.

TI Infidelity Analysis of Digital Counter-Diabatic Driving in Simple
   Two-Qubit System
SO ENTROPY
AB Digitized counter-diabatic (CD) optimization algorithms have been proposed and extensively studied to enhance performance in quantum computing by accelerating adiabatic processes while minimizing energy transitions. While adding approximate counter-diabatic terms can initially introduce adiabatic errors that decrease over time, Trotter errors from decomposition approximation persist. On the other hand, increasing the high-order nested commutators for CD terms may improve adiabatic errors but could also introduce additional Trotter errors. In this article, we examine the two-qubit model to explore the interplay between approximate CD, adiabatic errors, Trotter errors, coefficients, and commutators. Through these analyses, we aim to gain insights into optimizing these factors for better fidelity, a shallower circuit depth, and a reduced gate number in near-term gate-based quantum computing.

TI Quantum Enhancement in Dark Matter Detection with Quantum Computation
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB We propose a novel method to significantly enhance the signal rate in qubit-based dark matter detection experiments with the help of quantum interference. Various quantum sensors possess ideal properties for detecting wavelike dark matter, and qubits, commonly employed in quantum computers, are excellent candidates for dark matter detectors. We demonstrate that, by designing an appropriate quantum circuit to manipulate the qubits, the signal rate scales proportionally to n2q, with nq being the number of sensor qubits, rather than linearly with nq. Consequently, in the dark matter detection with a substantial number of sensor qubits, a significant increase in the signal rate can be expected. We provide a specific example of a quantum circuit that achieves this enhancement by coherently combining the phase evolution in each individual qubit due to its interaction with dark matter. We also demonstrate that the circuit is fault tolerant to dephasing noises, a critical quantum noise source in quantum computers. The enhancement mechanism proposed here is applicable to various modalities for quantum computers, provided that the quantum operations relevant to enhancing the dark matter signal can be applied to these devices.

TI Dynamics of superconducting qubit relaxation times
SO NPJ QUANTUM INFORMATION
AB Superconducting qubits are a leading candidate for quantum computing but display temporal fluctuations in their energy relaxation times T-1. This introduces instabilities in multi-qubit device performance. Furthermore, autocorrelation in these time fluctuations introduces challenges for obtaining representative measures of T-1 for process optimization and device screening. These T-1 fluctuations are often attributed to time varying coupling of the qubit to defects, putative two level systems (TLSs). In this work, we develop a technique to probe the spectral and temporal dynamics of T-1 in single junction transmons by repeated T-1 measurements in the frequency vicinity of the bare qubit transition, via the AC-Stark effect. Across 10 qubits, we observe strong correlations between the mean T-1 averaged over approximately nine months and a snapshot of an equally weighted T-1 average over the Stark shifted frequency range. These observations are suggestive of an ergodic-like spectral diffusion of TLSs dominating T-1, and offer a promising path to more rapid T-1 characterization for device screening and process optimization.

TI Improved source-correlated quantum key distribution
SO ACTA PHYSICA SINICA
AB Based on the basic principles of quantum mechanics, quantum key distribution (QKD) provides unconditional security for long-distance communication. However, existing QKD with relevant source protocols have limited tolerance for source correlation, which greatly reduces the key generation rate and limits the secure transmission distance, thereby limiting their practical deployment. In this work, we propose an improved QKD with correlated source protocol to overcome these limitations by discarding the traditional loss-tolerant security frameworks. Our approach adopts the standard BB84 protocol for the security analysis, under the assumption that the source correlation has a bounded range and characterized inner product of the states. We theoretically analyze the performance of the improved protocol at different levels of source correlation and channel loss. Numerical simulations show that our protocol achieves a much higher secret key rate and longer transmission distance than traditional schemes. In the case of typical parameters and 0 dB loss, our protocol achieves about 1.5-3 times improvement in secret key rate. Additionally, the maximum tolerable loss is enhanced by about 2-6 dB. This highlights a promising direction for enhancing the robustness and practicality of QKD with correlated sources systems, paving the way for their deployment in real-world quantum communication networks.

TI Unifying framework for quantum simulation algorithms for time-dependent
   Hamiltonian dynamics
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Recently, there has been growing interest in simulating time-dependent Hamiltonians using quantum algorithms, driven by diverse applications, such as quantum adiabatic computing. While techniques for simulating time-independent Hamiltonian dynamics are well established, time-dependent Hamiltonian dynamics is less explored and it is unclear how to systematically organize existing methods and to find new methods. SambeHowland's continuous clock elegantly transforms time-dependent Hamiltonian dynamics into time-independent Hamiltonian dynamics, which means that by taking different discretizations, existing methods for timeindependent Hamiltonian dynamics can be exploited for time-dependent dynamics. In this work, we systemically investigate how Sambe-Howland's clock can serve as a unifying framework for simulating time-dependent Hamiltonian dynamics. First, we demonstrate the versatility of this approach by showcasing its compatibility with analog quantum computing and digital quantum computing. Second, for digital quantum computers, we illustrate how this framework, combined with time-independent methods (e.g., product formulas, multiproduct formulas, qDrift, and linear combination of unitaries-Taylor), can facilitate the development of efficient algorithms for simulating time-dependent dynamics. This framework allows us to (1) resolve the problem of finding minimum-gate time-dependent product formulas; (2) establish a unified picture of both Suzuki's and Huyghebaert and De Raedt's approaches; (3) generalize Huyghebaert and De Raedt's first- and second-order formula to arbitrary orders; (4) answer an unsolved question in establishing time-dependent multiproduct formulas; (5) and recover continuous qDrift on the same footing as time-independent qDrift. Third, we demonstrate the efficacy of our higher-order Huyghebaert and De Raedt's algorithm through digital adiabatic simulation.

AB The first generation of post-quantum cryptography (PQC) standards by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) is just around the corner. The need for secure implementations is therefore increasing. In this work, we address this need and investigate the integration of lattice-based PQC into an open-source silicon root of trust (RoT), the OpenTitan. RoTs are important security building blocks that need to be future-proofed with PQC. The OpenTitan features multiple cryptographic hardware accelerators and countermeasures against physical attacks, but does not offer dedicated support for lattice-based PQC. Thus, we propose instruction set extensions for the OpenTitan Big Number Accelerator (OTBN) to improve the efficiency of polynomial arithmetic and sampling. As a case study we analyze the performance of signature verification of digital signature scheme Dilithium. Our implementation verifies signatures within 997,722 cycles for security level II, pushing this RoT functionality below 10 ms for the OpenTitan's target frequency of 100 MHz. With an overhead of 242 kGE, our hardware extensions make up only about 5 % of the total RoT area. All our extensions integrate seamlessly with countermeasures against physical attacks and comply with the adversary model chosen by the OpenTitan project.

AB Fault-tolerant quantum computation using lattice surgery can be abstracted as operations on graphs, wherein each logical qubit corresponds to a vertex of the graph, and multi-qubit measurements are accomplished by connecting the vertices with paths between them. Operations attempting to connect vertices without a valid path will result in abnormal termination. As the permissible paths may evolve during execution, it is necessary to statically verify that the execution of a quantum program can be completed. This paper introduces a type-based method to statically verify that well-typed programs can be executed without encountering halts induced by surgery operations. Alongside, we present Q(LS), a first-order quantum programming language to formalize the execution model of surgery operations. Furthermore, we provide a type checking algorithm by reducing the type checking problem to the offline dynamic connectivity problem.

TI Efficient quantum computation of molecular forces and other energy
   gradients
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB While most work on the quantum simulation of chemistry has focused on computing energy surfaces, a similarly important application requiring subtly different algorithms is the computation of energy derivatives. Almost all molecular properties can be expressed an energy derivative, including molecular forces, which are essential for applications such as molecular dynamics simulations. Here, we introduce new quantum algorithms for computing molecular energy derivatives with significantly lower complexity than prior methods. Under cost models appropriate for noisy-intermediate scale quantum devices, we demonstrate how low-rank factorization and other tomography schemes can be optimized for energy derivative calculations. We numerically demonstrate that our techniques reduce the number of circuit repetitions required by many orders of magnitude for even modest systems, and that the cost of estimating an entire force vector may in some systems be lower than the cost of estimating the energy. In the context of fault-tolerant algorithms, we develop new methods of estimating energy derivatives with Heisenberg limited scaling, incorporating state-of-the-art techniques for block encoding fermionic operators. In contrast to our near-term results, we find that the cost of estimating forces with any of our Heisenberg-limited methods is bounded by the cost of estimating energies, due to inner loops requiring either energy estimation or reflections around the ground state. This implies that applications such as geometry optimization, coupling parameter estimation, and spectral prediction may be practical on fault-tolerant quantum devices, but tractable molecular dynamics simulations of large-scale systems requires further algorithmic advances.

TI Efficient and fail-safe quantum algorithm for the transport equation
SO JOURNAL OF COMPUTATIONAL PHYSICS
AB In this paper we present a scalable algorithm for fault-tolerant quantum computers for solving the transport equation in two and three spatial dimensions for variable grid sizes and discrete velocities, where the object walls are aligned with the Cartesian grid, the relative difference of velocities in each dimension is bounded by 1 and the total simulated time is dependent on the discrete velocities chosen. We provide detailed descriptions and complexity analyses of all steps of our quantum transport method (QTM) and present numerical results for 2D flows generated in Qiskit as a proof of concept. Our QTM is based on a novel streaming approach which leads to a reduction in the amount of CNOT gates required in comparison to state-of-the-art quantum streaming methods. As a second highlight of this paper we present a novel object encoding method, that reduces the complexity of the amount of CNOT gates required to encode walls, which now becomes independent of the size of the wall. Finally we present a novel quantum encoding of the particles' discrete velocities that enables a linear speed-up in the costs of reflecting the velocity of a particle, which now becomes independent of the amount of velocities encoded. Our main contribution consists of a detailed description of a fail-safe implementation of a quantum algorithm for the reflection step of the transport equation that can be readily implemented on a physical quantum computer. This fail-safe implementation allows for a variety of initial conditions and particle velocities and leads to physically correct particle flow behavior around the walls, edges and corners of obstacles. Combining these results we present a novel and fail-safe quantum algorithm for the transport equation that can be used for a multitude of flow configurations and leads to physically correct behavior. ( ) We finally show that our approach only requires O ������������������2 ������+ ������������������������ ������2CNOT gates, which is ������ max quadratic in the amount of qubits necessary to encode the grid and the amount of qubits necessary to encode the discrete velocities in a single spatial dimension. This complexity result makes our approach superior to state-of-the-art approaches known in the literature.

TI Recompilation-enhanced simulation of electron-phonon dynamics on IBM
   quantum computers
SO NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB Simulating quantum systems is believed to be one of the first applications for which quantum computers may demonstrate a useful advantage. For many problems in physics, we are interested in studying the evolution of the electron-phonon Hamiltonian, for which efficient digital quantum computing schemes exist. Yet to date, no accurate simulation of this system has been produced on real quantum hardware. In this work, we consider the absolute resource cost for gate-based quantum simulation of small electron-phonon systems as dictated by the number of Trotter steps and bosonic energy levels necessary for the convergence of dynamics. We then apply these findings to perform experiments on IBM quantum hardware for both weak and strong electron-phonon coupling. Despite significant device noise, through the use of approximate circuit recompilation we obtain electron-phonon dynamics on current quantum computers comparable to exact diagonalisation. Our results represent a significant step in utilising near term quantum computers for simulation of quantum dynamics and highlight the novelty of approximate circuit recompilation as a tool for reducing noise.

TI Heralded generation of entanglement with photons
SO REPORTS ON PROGRESS IN PHYSICS
AB Entangled states of photons form the backbone of many quantum technologies. Due to the lack of effective photon-photon interactions, the generation of these states is typically probabilistic. In the prevailing but fundamentally limited generation technique, known as postselection, the target photons are measured destructively in the generation process. By contrast, in the alternative approach-heralded state generation-the successful creation of a desired state is verified by the detection of ancillary photons. Heralded state generation is superior to postselection in several critical ways: it enables free usage of the prepared states, allows for the success probability to be arbitrarily increased via multiplexing, and provides a scalable route to quantum information processing using photons. Here, we review theoretical proposals and experimental realisations of heralded entangled photonic state generation, as well as the impact of realistic experimental errors. We then discuss the wide-ranging applications of these states for quantum technologies, including resource states in linear optical quantum computing, entanglement swapping for repeater networks, fundamental physics, and quantum metrology.

TI Generation, characterization, and manipulation of quantum correlations
   in electron beams
SO NPJ QUANTUM INFORMATION
AB Entanglement engineering plays a central role in quantum-enhanced technologies, with potential physical platforms that outperform their classical counterparts. However, free electrons remain largely unexplored despite their great capacity to encode and manipulate quantum information, due in part to the lack of a suitable theoretical framework. Here we link theoretical concepts from quantum information to available free-electron sources. Specifically, we consider the interactions among electrons propagating near the surface of a polariton-supporting medium and study the entanglement induced by pair-wise coupling. These correlations depend on the controlled interaction interval and the initial electron bandwidth. We show that long interaction times of broadband electrons extend their temporal coherence. This in turn is revealed through a widened Hong-Ou-Mandel peak and is associated with an increased entanglement entropy. We then introduce a discrete basis of electronic temporal modes and discriminate between them via coincidence detection with a shaped probe. This paves the way for ultrafast quantum information transfer by means of free electrons, rendering the large alphabet that they span in the time domain accessible.

TI Engineering Classical Capacity of Generalized Pauli Channels with

SO ENTROPY
AB In this paper, we analyze the classical capacity of the generalized Pauli channels generated via memory kernel master equations. For suitable engineering of the kernel parameters, evolution with non-local noise effects can produce dynamical maps with a higher capacity than a purely Markovian evolution. We provide instructive examples for qubit and qutrit evolution. Interestingly, similar behavior is not observed when analyzing time-local master equations.

TI Lower Bounds on Quantum Annealing Times
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB The adiabatic theorem provides sufficient conditions for the time needed to prepare a target ground state. While it is possible to prepare a target state much faster with more general quantum annealing protocols, rigorous results beyond the adiabatic regime are rare. Here, we provide such a result, deriving lower bounds on the time needed to successfully perform quantum annealing. The bounds are asymptotically saturated by three toy models where fast annealing schedules are known: the Roland and Cerf unstructured search model, the Hamming spike problem, and the ferromagnetic p-spin model. Our bounds demonstrate that these schedules have optimal scaling. Our results also show that rapid annealing requires coherent superpositions of energy eigenstates, singling out quantum coherence as a computational resource.

TI Quantum simulation of the pseudo-Hermitian
   Landau-Zener-Stückelberg-Majorana effect
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB While the Hamiltonians used in standard quantum mechanics are Hermitian, it is also possible to extend the theory to non -Hermitian Hamiltonians. Particularly interesting are non -Hermitian Hamiltonians satisfying parity-time ( PT ) symmetry, or more generally pseudo-Hermiticity, since such non -Hermitian Hamiltonians can still exhibit real eigenvalues. In this article, we present a quantum simulation of the time -dependent non -Hermitian nonPT -symmetric Hamiltonian used in a pseudo -Hermitian extension of the Landau-Zener- St & uuml;ckelberg-Majorana (LZSM) model. The simulation is implemented on a superconducting processor by using Naimark dilation to transform a non -Hermitian Hamiltonian for one qubit into a Hermitian Hamiltonian for a qubit and an ancilla; postselection on the ancilla state ensures that the qubit undergoes nonunitary time evolution corresponding to the original non -Hermitian Hamiltonian. We observe properties such as the dependence of transition probabilities on time and the replacement of conservation of total probability by other dynamical invariants in agreement with predictions based on a theoretical treatment of the pseudo -Hermitian LZSM system.

TI Variational Quantum Algorithm for Photonic Crystals
SO PROGRESS IN ELECTROMAGNETICS RESEARCH-PIER
AB Photonic crystals (PhCs) play a crucial role in describing the quantized collective behavior of wave functions. However, the existing investigations into their eigenstates primarily rely on classical computational methods. Variational quantum algorithm (VQA) represents a promising quantum computing technology that can be implemented on noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices, potentially surpassing the classical computational capabilities. Here, we propose a method to analyze the band and eigenstate properties of PhCs based on variational quantum eigensolver (VQE). We firstly reformulate the Maxwell's equations into a Hermitian generalized eigenvalue problem. By appropriately selecting a loss function and employing the proposed quantum eigenvalue solver, we successfully obtain the generalized eigenvalues using a quantum gradient descent algorithm. To validate our approach, we perform simulations on two prototypical PhCs in square and hexagonal lattices. The results demonstrate that a complex Ansatz can effectively capture the optimal solution, successfully yielding the generalized eigenvalues, but a simpler Ansatz exhibits significant limitations. Our findings provide new insights into the application of VQAs in PhCs and other quantum topological systems.

TI Simulating Z2 lattice gauge theory with the variational
   quantum thermalizer
SO EPJ QUANTUM TECHNOLOGY
AB The properties of strongly-coupled lattice gauge theories at finite density as well as in real time have largely eluded first-principles studies on the lattice. This is due to the failure of importance sampling for systems with a complex action. An alternative to evade the sign problem is quantum simulation. Although still in its infancy, a lot of progress has been made in devising algorithms to address these problems. In particular, recent efforts have addressed the question of how to produce thermal Gibbs states on a quantum computer. In this study, we apply a variational quantum algorithm to a low-dimensional model which has a local abelian gauge symmetry. We demonstrate how this approach can be applied to obtain information regarding the phase diagram as well as unequal-time correlation functions at non-zero temperature.

TI Quantum resources of quantum and classical variational methods
SO MACHINE LEARNING-SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB Variational techniques have long been at the heart of atomic, solid-state, and many-body physics. They have recently extended to quantum and classical machine learning, providing a basis for representing quantum states via neural networks. These methods generally aim to minimize the energy of a given ansatz, though open questions remain about the expressivity of quantum and classical variational ans & auml;tze. The connection between variational techniques and quantum computing, through variational quantum algorithms, offers opportunities to explore the quantum complexity of classical methods. We demonstrate how the concept of non-stabilizerness, or magic, can create a bridge between quantum information and variational techniques and we show that energy accuracy is a necessary but not always sufficient condition for accuracy in non-stabilizerness. Through systematic benchmarking of neural network quantum states, matrix product states, and variational quantum methods, we show that while classical techniques are more accurate in non-stabilizerness, not accounting for the symmetries of the system can have a severe impact on this accuracy. Our findings form a basis for a universal expressivity characterization of both quantum and classical variational methods.

TI Deployment-Ready Quantum Key Distribution Over a Classical Network
   Infrastructure in Padua
SO JOURNAL OF LIGHTWAVE TECHNOLOGY
AB Current technological progress is driving Quantum Key Distribution towards a commercial and worldwide scale expansion. Its capability to deliver secure communication regardless of the computational power of the attackers will be a fundamental feature in the next generations of telecommunication networks. Nevertheless, demonstrations of QKD implementation in a real operating scenario and their coexistence with the classical telecom infrastructure are of fundamental importance for reliable exploitation. Here we present a Quantum Key Distribution application implemented over a classical fiber-based infrastructure. We exploit a 50 MHz source at 1550 nm, a single 13 km-long fiber cable for both the quantum and the classical channel, and a simplified receiver scheme with just one single-photon detector. In this way, we achieve an error rate of approximately 2% and a secret key rate of about 1.7 kbps, thus demonstrating the feasibility of low-cost and ready-to-use Quantum Key Distribution systems compatible with standard classical infrastructure.

AB The hybrid architecture of the driven qubit-photon-magnon system has recently emerged as a promising candidate for novel quantum technologies. In this paper, we introduce the effective wave-function of a superconducting single qubit and a magnon mode contained within a cavity resonator and an external field. The non-classicality of the magnon and resonator modes are investigated by using the negative values of the Wigner function. Additionally, we discuss the non-classicality of the qubit state via the Wigner-Yanase skew information. We find that the mixture angle of the qubit-resonator plays a controllable role in non-classicality. However, the strength of the magnon-photon increases the non-classical behaviour of the system.

TI Fusion cryptography for secure medical data transmission using
   mathematical quantum computing operations
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB With the growing demand for highly secure medical data transmission, this research introduces a fused cryptography framework that integrates mathematical quantum computing operations with advanced classical encryption techniques. The proposed method incorporates quantum principles, including quantum walks, quantum-based cyclic shift operators, quantum XOR operations, and quantum key image generation with classical methods such as bit-plane extraction and hyperchaotic system-based scrambling. A hyperchaotic map generates random key sequences to produce both a spatial domain random image and a quantum key image. The medical image is first decomposed into eight bit-planes, and only the high-information bit-planes (HIBPs) undergo encryption to optimize computational efficiency. HIBPs are scrambled using multilayer, block-wise, and diagonal permutations based on the chaotic sequences. Quantum encryption is then applied, starting with novel enhanced quantum representation encoding, followed by Baker map-based scrambling and quantum XOR diffusion to secure the final ciphertext. Extensive experiments, including entropy evaluation, noise attack resilience, clipping attack robustness, and correlation analysis, confirm the superior security and performance of the proposed method. Notably, the algorithm achieves near-ideal results, such as an entropy of 7.9999, a correlation coefficient of 0.0001, 98% plaintext recovery after 30% noise corruption, and 96% recovery after 25% ciphertext clipping, demonstrating its robustness for secure medical data transmission.

TI Simpler (Classical) and Faster (Quantum) Algorithms for Gibbs Partition
   Functions
SO QUANTUM
AB We present classical and quantum algorithms for approximating partition functions of classical Hamiltonians at a given temperature. Our work has two main contributions: first, we modify the classical algorithm of Stefankovic, Vempala and Vigoda (J. ACM, 56(3), 2009) to improve its sample complexity; second, we quantize this new algorithm, improving upon the previously fastest quantum algorithm for this problem, due to Harrow and Wei (SODA 2020). The conventional approach to estimating partition functions requires approxi-mating the means of Gibbs distributions at a set of inverse temperatures that form the so-called cooling schedule. The length of the cooling schedule directly affects the complexity of the algorithm. Combining our improved version of the algorithm of Stefankovic, Vempala and Vigoda with the paired-product estimator of Huber (Ann. Appl. Probab., 25(2), 2015), our new quantum al-gorithm uses a shorter cooling schedule than previously known. This length matches the optimal length conjectured by Stefankovic, Vempala and Vigoda. The quantum algorithm also achieves a quadratic advantage in the number of required quantum samples compared to the number of random samples drawn by the best classical algorithm, and its computational complexity has quadrat-ically better dependence on the spectral gap of the Markov chains used to produce the quantum samples.

Here we show how to use a simple and customizable class of circuits-randomized mirror circuits-to perform scalable, robust, and flexible randomized benchmarking of Clifford gates. We show that this technique approximately estimates the infidelity of an average many-qubit logic layer, and we use simulations of up to 225 qubits with physically realistic error rates in the range 0.1%-1% to demonstrate its scalability. We then use up to 16 physical qubits of a cloud quantum computing platform to demonstrate that our technique can reveal and quantify crosstalk errors in many-qubit circuits.

TI Surpassing the loss-noise robustness trade-off in quantum key
   distribution
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW APPLIED
AB Quantum key distribution (QKD) offers a theoretically secure method to share secret keys, yet practical implementations face challenges due to noise and loss over long-distance channels. Traditional QKD protocols require extensive noise compensation, hindering their industrial scalability and lowering the achievable key rates. Alternative protocols encode logical qubits in noise-resilient states but at the cost of using many physical qubits, increasing susceptibility to loss and limiting transmission distance. In this work, we introduce a logical-qubit encoding that uses antisymmetric Bell states in the continuous photonic degrees of freedom, frequency and time. By leveraging the continuous space, we overcome this noise-loss robustness trade-off by minimizing the number of photons per logical qubit while optimizing the encoding resilience over noise fluctuations. We analyze the security of our encoding and demonstrate its robustness compared to existing state-of-the-art protocols. This approach provides a path toward scalable, efficient QKD implementations under realistic noise conditions.

TI Quantum PUF for Security and Trust in Quantum Computing
SO IEEE JOURNAL ON EMERGING AND SELECTED TOPICS IN CIRCUITS AND SYSTEMS
AB Quantum computing is a promising paradigm to solve computationally intractable problems. Various companies such as, IBM, Rigetti and D-Wave offer quantum computers using a cloud-based platform that possess several interesting features namely, (i) quantum hardware with various number of qubits and coupling maps exist at the cloud end that offer different computing capabilities; (ii) multiple hardware with identical coupling maps exist in the suite; (iii) coupling map of larger hardware with more number of qubits can fit the coupling map of many smaller hardware; (iv) the quality of each of the hardware is distinct; (v) user cannot validate the origination of the result obtained from a quantum hardware. In other words, the user relies on the scheduler of the cloud provider to allocate the requested hardware; (vi) the queue of quantum programs at the cloud end is typically long and maximizing the throughput, which is the key to reducing costs and helping the scientific community in their explorations. The above factors motivate a new threat model with following possibilities: (a) in future, less-trustworthy quantum computers from 3rd parties can allocate poor quality hardware to save on cost or towards satisfying their falsely-advertised qubit or quantum hardware specifications; (b) the workload scheduling algorithm could have a bug or malicious code segment which will try to maximize throughput at the cost of allocation to poor fidelity hardware. Such bugs are possible for trustworthy providers; (c) a rogue employee in trusted cloud vendor could try to sabotage the vendor's reputation by degrading the user compute fidelity just by tampering with the scheduling algorithm or rerouting the program; (d) a rogue employee can steal information by redirecting the programs to a 3rd party quantum hardware where they have full control. If the allocated hardware is inferior in quality, the user will suffer from poor quality result or longer convergence time. We propose two flavors of a Quantum Physically Unclonable Function (QuPUF) to address this issue- one based on superposition and another based on decoherence. Our experiments on real quantum hardware reveal that temporal variations in qubit quality can degrade the quality of the proposed QuPUF. We add a parametric rotation to the QuPUF for stability. Experiments on real IBM quantum hardware show that the proposed QuPUF can achieve inter-die Hamming Distance (HD) of 55% and intra-HD as low as 4%, as compared to ideal cases of 50% and 0% respectively. The proposed QuPUFs can also be used as a standalone solution for any other application.

TI Discrete-Modulated Coherent-State Quantum Key Distribution with
   Basis-Encoding
SO RESEARCH
AB Discrete-modulated coherent-state continuous-variable quantum key distribution (DMCS-CVQKD) is of great value for its simple implementation. However, the traditional DMCS-CVQKD scheme cannot tolerate the high channel excess noise and channel loss, compared to the Gaussian-modulated scheme, and its error correction is still difficult. In this paper, we propose a discrete-modulated coherent-state basis-encoding quantum key distribution (DMCS-BE-QKD) protocol, where the secret keys are encoded in the random choice of 2 measurement bases, i.e., the conjugate quadratures X and P of discrete-modulated coherent states, and it only needs simple binary sequence error correction. We analyze the secret key rate of DMCS-BE-QKD protocol under individual and collective attacks in the linear Gaussian channel. The results show that DMCS-BE-QKD can greatly enhance the ability to tolerate the channel loss and excess noise compared to the original DMCS-CVQKD protocol, which can tolerate approximately 40 dB more channel loss compared to the original DMCS-CVQKD for the realistic value of noise. Finally, a proof-of-principle experiment is conducted under a 50.5-km optical fiber to verify the feasibility of DMCS-BE-QKD. It is based on the consistent physical procedures of the traditional DMCS-CVQKD, which makes it perfectly compatible to deployed terminals and can serve as a multiplier for the practical secure quantum cryptography communication in harsh environments.

TI A Practical Quantum Network Coding Protocol Based on Non-Maximally
   Entangled State
SO CMC-COMPUTERS MATERIALS & CONTINUA
AB In many earlier works, perfect quantum state transmission over the butterfly network can be achieved via quantum network coding protocols with the assist of maximally entangled states. However, in actual quantum networks, a maximally entangled state as auxiliary resource is hard to be obtained or easily turned into a non-maximally entangled state subject to all kinds of environmental noises. Therefore, we propose a more practical quantum network coding scheme with the assist of non-maximally entangled states. In this paper, a practical quantum network coding protocol over grail network is proposed, in which the non-maximally entangled resource is assisted and even the desired quantum state can be perfectly transmitted. The achievable rate region, security and practicability of the proposed protocol are discussed and analyzed. This practical quantum network coding protocol proposed over the grail network can be regarded as a useful attempt to help move the theory of quantum network coding towards practicability.

TI Dynamical photon-photon interaction mediated by a quantum emitter
SO NATURE PHYSICS
AB Single photons role in the development of quantum science and technology. They can carry quantum information over extended distances to act as the backbone of a future quantum Internet(1) and can be manipulated in advanced photonic circuits, enabling scalable photonic quantum computing(2,3). However, more sophisticated devices and protocols need access to multi-photon states with particular forms of entanglement. Efficient light-matter interfaces offer a route to reliably generating these entangled resource states(4,5). Here we utilize the efficient and coherent coupling of a single quantum emitter to a nanophotonic waveguide to realize a quantum nonlinear interaction between single-photon wavepackets. We demonstrate the control of a photon using a second photon mediated by the quantum emitter. The dynamical response of the two-photon interaction is experimentally unravelled and reveals quantum correlations controlled by the pulse duration. Further development of this platform work, which constitutes a new research frontier in quantum optics(6), will enable the tailoring of complex photonic quantum resource states.

TI Ten-channel Hong-On-Mandel interference between independent optical
   combs
SO CHINESE OPTICS LETTERS
AB The dissipative Kerr soliton (DKS) frequency comb exhibits broad and narrow-linewidth frequency modes, which make it suitable for quantum communication. However, a scalable quantum network based on multiple independent combs is still a challenge due to fabrication-induced frequency mismatches. This limitation becomes critical in measurement-deviceindependent quantum key distribution, which requires high visibility of Hong-Ou-Mandel interference between multiple frequency channels. Here, we experimentally demonstrate two independent DKS combs with 10 spectrally aligned lines without any frequency locking system. The visibility for individual comb-line pairs reaches up to 46.72%+/- 0.63% via precision frequency translation, establishing a foundation for deploying DKS combs in multi-user quantum networks.

TI NISQ Computers: A Path to Quantum Supremacy
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB The quest for quantum advantage, wherein quantum computers surpass the computational capabilities of classical computers executing state-of-the-art algorithms on well-defined tasks, represents a pivotal race in the domain of quantum computing. NISQ (Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum) computing has witnessed remarkable advancements, culminating in significant milestones on the journey towards the realization of universal fault-tolerant quantum computers. This transformative turning point, known as quantum supremacy, has been achieved amid a series of breakthroughs, signifying the dawn of the quantum era. Quantum hardware has undergone substantial integration and architectural evolution, contrasting with its nascent stages. In this review, we critically examine the quantum supremacy experiments conducted thus far, shedding light on their implications and contributions to the evolving landscape of quantum computing. Additionally, we endeavor to illuminate a range of cutting-edge proof-of-principle investigations in the realm of applied quantum computing, providing an insightful overview of the current state of applied quantum research and its prospective influence across diverse scientific, industrial, and technological frontiers.

TI Quantum Logic Gates Based on DNAtronics, RNAtronics, and Proteintronics
SO ADVANCED INTELLIGENT SYSTEMS
AB Quantum computers (QCs) adopt an n-state quantum mechanical system to manipulate the superposition state. However, molecular transistors are not used to build up the quantum logic gate. Herein, it is demonstrated that DNA, RNA, and protein are promising media for QCs, and one uses residue pairs, including nucleotide base pairs and amino acid pairs, via proton-coupled electron transfer to fabricate a quantum logic gate. In the residue pair, the proton transfer between donor and acceptor states fulfills a qubit. Both the DNA-CG (3-qubit) nucleobase pair and nucleotide base pair obey the Toffoli gate. AT (2-qubit) nucleotide base pair behaves as a SWAP gate and a CNOT gate. Furthermore, the AU and RNA-CG nucleotide base pairs follow the CNOT gate and Toffoli gate, respectively. In addition, a pair of amino acids achieves 1-qubit and satisfies the Pauli-X, -Y, and -Z gates. The generators of universal quantum logic gates are obtained.

TI Design and Characterization of a <4-mW/Qubit 28-nm Cryo-CMOS Integrated
   Circuit for Full Control of a Superconducting Quantum Processor Unit
   Cell
SO IEEE JOURNAL OF SOLID-STATE CIRCUITS
AB A universal fault-tolerant quantum computer will require large-scale control systems that can realize all the waveforms required to implement a gateset that is universal for quantum computing. Optimization of such a system, which must be precise and extensible, is an open research challenge. Here, we present a cryogenic quantum control integrated circuit (IC) that is able to control all the necessary degrees of freedom of a two-qubit subcircuit of a superconducting quantum processor. Specifically, the IC contains a pair of 4-8-GHz RF pulse generators for XY control, three baseband current gen-erators for qubit and coupler frequency control, and a digital controller that includes a sequencer for gate sequence playback. After motivating the architecture, we describe the circuit-level implementation details and present experimental results. Using standard benchmarking techniques, we show that the cryogenic CMOS (cryo-CMOS) IC is able to execute the components of a gateset that is universal for quantum computing while achieving single-qubit XY and Z average gate error rates of 0.17%- 0.36% and 0.14%-0.17%, respectively, as well as two-qubit average cross-entropy benchmarking (XEB) cycle error rates of 1.2%. These error rates, which were achieved while dissipating just 4 mW/qubit, are comparable to the measured error rates obtained using baseline room-temperature electronics.

AB Near-term quantum computers are primarily limited by errors in quantum operations (or gates) between two quantum bits (or qubits). A physical machine typically provides a set of basis gates that include primitive 2-qubit (2Q) and 1-qubit (1Q) gates that can be implemented in a given technology. 2Q entangling gates, coupled with some 1Q gates, allow for universal quantum computation. In superconducting technologies, the current state of the art is to implement the same 2Q gate between every pair of qubits (typically an XX-or XY-type gate). This strict hardware uniformity requirement for 2Q gates in a large quantum computer has made scaling up a time and resource-intensive endeavor in the lab.
   We propose a radical idea - allow the 2Q basis gate(s) to differ between every pair of qubits, selecting the best entangling gates that can be calibrated between given pairs of qubits. This work aims to give quantum scientists the ability to run meaningful algorithms with qubit systems that are not perfectly uniform. Scientists will also be able to use a much broader variety of novel 2Q gates for quantum computing. We develop a theoretical framework for identifying good 2Q basis gates on "nonstandard" Cartan trajectories that deviate from "standard" trajectories like XX. We then introduce practical methods for calibration and compilation with nonstandard 2Q gates, and discuss possible ways to improve the compilation. To demonstrate our methods in a case study, we simulated both standard XY-type trajectories and faster, nonstandard trajectories using an entangling gate architecture with far-detuned transmon qubits. We identify efficient 2Q basis gates on these nonstandard trajectories and use them to compile a number of standard benchmark circuits such as QFT and QAOA. Our results demonstrate an 8x improvement over the baseline 2Q gates with respect to speed and coherence-limited gate fidelity.

TI Variational quantum algorithms for Poisson equations based on the
   decomposition of sparse Hamiltonians
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Solving a Poisson equation is generally reduced to solving a linear system with a coefficient matrix A of entries a(i j), i, j = 1, 2,..., n, from the discretized Poisson equation. Although the variational quantum algorithms are promising algorithms to solve the discretized Poisson equation, they generally require that A be decomposed into a sum of O[poly(log(2)n)] simple operators in order to evaluate efficiently the loss function. A tensor product decomposition of A with 2log(2)n + 1 terms has been explored in previous works. In this paper, based on the decomposition of sparse Hamiltonians we greatly reduce the number of terms. We first write the loss function in terms of the operator sigma(x) circle times A with sigma(x) denoting the standard Pauli operator. Then for the one-dimensional Poisson equations with different boundary conditions and for the d-dimensional Poisson equations with Dirichlet boundary conditions, we decompose sigma(x) circle times A into a sum of at most 7 and (4d + 1) Hermitian, one-sparse, and self-inverse operators, respectively. We design explicitly the quantum circuits to evaluate efficiently the loss function. The decomposition method and the design of quantum circuits can also be easily extended to linear systems with Hermitian and sparse coefficient matrices satisfying a(i, i+c) = a(c) for c = 0, 1,..., n - 1 and i = 0, center dot center dot center dot, n - 1 - c.

TI High-fidelity and robust controlled-Z gates implemented with Rydberg
   atoms via echoing rapid adiabatic passage
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB High-fidelity and robust quantum gates are essential for quantum information processing, with neutral Rydberg atoms trapped in optical tweezer arrays serving as a versatile platform for the implementation. We propose a rapid adiabatic passage (RAP) scheme for achieving a high-fidelity controlled-Z Z (CZ) gate on a neutral-atom Rydberg platform. Utilizing only global laser dressing, our scheme involves echoing two identical RAP pulses within the Rydberg blockade regime to realize a CZ gate and can be readily extended to a CkZ k Z gate with additional qubits. We predict a CZ gate with fidelity over 0.9995 using alkali-metal atom parameters, and a CCZ gate with fidelity exceeding 0.999. Moreover, the direct utilization of echoing RAP pulses enables the implementation of a four-bit CCCZ gate at fidelity over 0.996 without further optimization. The proposed scheme, remarkably robust to variations in driving fields and realistic decoherence effects, holds promise for future quantum information processing applications.

TI Ultrafast hybrid fermion-to-qubit mapping
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
AB Fermion-to-qubit mappings play a crucial role in representing fermionic interactions on a quantum computer. Efficient mappings translate fermionic modes of a system to qubit interactions with a high degree of locality while using few auxiliary resources. We present a family of locality-preserving fermion-to-qubit mappings that require fewer auxiliary qubits than all existing schemes known to date. One instance requires only 1.016 qubits-per-fermion compared with 1.25 for the best-known locality-preserving mapping by Chen and Xu [PRX Quantum 4, 010326 (2023)]. Our family of mappings (parameterized by integer n) establishes a direct trade-off between the number of auxiliary qubits (1/n2) and the circuit length [O(log n)]. Furthermore, we present a nonlocal variant that combines the strengths of the Jordan-Wigner and Bravyi-Kitaev mappings to give 98% shorter circuits than the Jordan-Wigner mapping. This is achieved by applying seemingly incompatible mappings at different scales, making it possible for their respective strengths to complement each other.

AB Quantum computers might solve specific problems faster than classical computers in the future. But their actual qubit numbers are small, and the error rates are high. However, quantum computers are already used in various areas and a steadily increasing number is made available by cloud providers. To execute a quantum circuit, it is mapped to the quantum computer's hardware. The resulting compiled circuit strongly influences the precision of the execution in terms of occurring errors caused by used qubits and quantum gates. Selecting an optimal one is, therefore, essential. SDKs are used to implement circuits and differ in supported cloud providers and programming languages. These differences complicate a change to other backends. In previous work, we developed an automated framework to translate a given circuit and compile it on available quantum computers using multiple compilers. The compilation results can be prioritized and executed. Nevertheless, the translation and compilation with all compilers and quantum computers is resource-intensive and does not scale well with further backends in the future. We, therefore, present an extension to automatically select suitable compiler and quantum computer combinations based on the user's needs, e.g., for short waiting times and precise results based on past executions. To demonstrate and validate our approach, we show a prototype and case study.

TI Quantum state preparation and one qubit logic from third-order nonlinear
   interactions
SO JOURNAL OF THE OPTICAL SOCIETY OF AMERICA B-OPTICAL PHYSICS
AB We present a study on preparing and manipulating temporal-mode (TM) qubits based on third-order nonlinear interactions. Specifically, we consider the process of frequency conversion via difference frequency generation. To prepare a qubit, we aim to use Gaussian input states to a nonlinear waveguide. The coupling between the input state and a specific TM is maximized, obtaining qubits prepared with fidelities close to one. TMs evolve linearly within the medium; therefore, it is possible to define rotations around any axis contained in the x y plane, allowing spanning the full Bloch sphere in two steps. Particularly, we present a method to obtain any of the Pauli quantum gates by varying geometric or user-accessible parameters in a given experimental configuration when time-ordering effects are ignored. Our study allows for experimentally feasible proposals capable of controllable arbitrary qubit transformations. (C) 2021 Optical Society of America

TI Impact of quantum information encoding and metallic leads on dynamical
   multipartite correlation formation in semiconductor quantum dot arrays
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICS-CONDENSED MATTER
AB This study investigates quantum information scrambling (QIS) in a semiconductor quantum dot array. Starting with the 1D Transverse Field Ising model, we expand to more relevant quasi-2D frameworks such as the Heisenberg chain, super-extended Fermi-Hubbard (FH) and hardcore FH models. Assessing their relevance to semiconductor spin-qubit quantum computers, simulations of multipartite correlation formation examine qubit encoding strategies' fidelity, stability, and robustness, revealing trade-offs among these aspects. Furthermore, we investigate the weakly coupled metallic injector/detector (I/D) leads' significant impact on QIS behavior by employing multi-lead N-single orbital impurities weakly coupled Anderson models and studying the unitary evolution of the system. We observe sign flips in spatiotemporal tripartite mutual information which result in significant effects on dynamical correlation structures and their formation. Exploring carrier number effects, we identify optimal regions for QIS enhancement. Our findings emphasize the necessity of proper qubit encoding and I/D leads' influence on quantum information dynamics.

TI Enhanced Quantum Entanglement Detection of General Two Qubits Systems
   Based on Modified CNN-BiLSTM Model
SO ADVANCED QUANTUM TECHNOLOGIES
AB Entanglement is a key element in quantum information processing. The detection of entanglement is crucial in many long-range quantum information tasks, including secure communication and fundamental tests of quantum physics, but it is also highly resource-intensive. Even for simple 2-qubits systems, satisfactory detection is challenging. In this work, a modified entanglement detection model combining a convolutional neural network (CNN) and a bidirectional long short-term memory network (BiLSTM) is proposed. It shows that the proposed model can effectively extract the deep features and correlations, enabling accurate classification of simple quantum states, even with only a few tens of training samples. When trained with a large number of highly random samples, the model exhibits outstanding fitting capability, resulting in the reliable classification of nearly all common 2-qubits systems. Furthermore, the model exhibits exceptional adaptability and significant application potential in higher-dimensional systems.

TI Chemical control of spin-lattice relaxation to discover a room
   temperature molecular qubit
SO CHEMICAL SCIENCE
AB The second quantum revolution harnesses exquisite quantum control for a slate of diverse applications including sensing, communication, and computation. Of the many candidates for building quantum systems, molecules offer both tunability and specificity, but the principles to enable high temperature operation are not well established. Spin-lattice relaxation, represented by the time constant T-1, is the primary factor dictating the high temperature performance of quantum bits (qubits), and serves as the upper limit on qubit coherence times (T-2). For molecular qubits at elevated temperatures (>100 K), molecular vibrations facilitate rapid spin-lattice relaxation which limits T-2 to well below operational minimums for certain quantum technologies. Here we identify the effects of controlling orbital angular momentum through metal coordination geometry and ligand rigidity via pi-conjugation on T-1 relaxation in three four-coordinate Cu2+ S = 1/2 qubit candidates: bis(N,N'-dimethyl-4-amino-3-penten-2-imine) copper(u) (Me(2)Nac)(2) (1), bis(acetylacetone)ethylenediamine copper(u) Cu(acacen) (2), and tetramethyltetraazaannulene copper(u) Cu(tmtaa) (3). We obtain significant T-1 improvement upon changing from tetrahedral to square planar geometries through changes in orbital angular momentum. T-1 is further improved with greater pi-conjugation in the ligand framework. Our electronic structure calculations reveal that the reduced motion of low energy vibrations in the primary coordination sphere slows relaxation and increases T-1. These principles enable us to report a new molecular qubit candidate with room temperature T-2 = 0.43 mu s, and establishes guidelines for designing novel qubit candidates operating above 100 K.

TI Post-quantum cryptography techniques for secure communication in
   resource-constrained Internet of Things devices: A comprehensive survey
SO SOFTWARE-PRACTICE & EXPERIENCE
AB As the number and characteristics of smart devices change, the concept of the Internet of Things (IoT) emerges. The IoT provides the connected devices with a variety of resources that enable effective communication. At this point, several security issues arise to get the sensitive information behind every communication in the IoT. To provide users with security and privacy, cryptographic schemes are adopted, the most popular being public key cryptographic systems (PKC). However, with the advent of quantum computing, the level of security that can be provided by the PKC schemes is a big question. Another important issue is that the IoT environment is resource-constrained, which necessitates the implementation of lightweight cryptographic algorithms for better security. In response to these issues, the post-quantum cryptographic (PQC) schemes are one of the significant developments contributing to IoT security in the post-quantum world. This article examines the key security issues in the IoT environment and examines the effective solutions found in the literature. The problems in IoT in the quantum era are discussed and appropriate solutions by PKC schemes under limited resources in IoT are focused. As the lattice-based cryptosystems are more effective, the importance of these schemes in the resource-constrained IoT is highlighted. This survey also leads to feasible future directions that can support developers and researchers in this field.

TI Effect of emitters on quantum state transfer in coupled cavity arrays
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
AB Over the last decade, conditions for perfect state transfer in quantum spin chains have been discovered and their experimental realizations addressed, as have their extensions to more complex geometries of coupled cavity-emitter arrays. In this paper we further consider such studies and situations in which quantum state transfer can occur with high fidelity, even when the cavity-cavity coupling rates and cavity-emitter interaction rates are comparable. This is accomplished through the development and use of a Monte Carlo approach to the inverse eigenvalue problem, which allows the determination of coupling rates which optimize quantum state transfer fidelity and subsequent time evolution of the polariton wave function through exact diagonalization of the resulting Jaynes-Cummings-Hubbard Hamiltonian. The effect of inhomogeneous emitter locations is also evaluated. Our key results include the demonstration that our methodology can be used successfully to establish Hamiltonian parameters for high-fidelity state transfer in more general lattice geometries and excitation number sectors, and also a determination of the effects of fluctuations in those parameters about their optimal values.

TI Quantum-effective exact multiple patterns matching algorithms for
   biological sequences
SO PEERJ COMPUTER SCIENCE
AB This article presents efficient quantum solutions for exact multiple pattern matching to process the biological sequences. The classical solution takes O(mN) time for matching m patterns over N sized text database. The quantum search mechanism is a core for pattern matching, as this reduces time complexity and achieves computational speedup. Few quantum methods are available for multiple pattern matching, which executes search oracle for each pattern in successive iterations. Such solutions are likely acceptable because of classical equivalent quantum designs. However, these methods are constrained with the inclusion of multiplicative factor m in their complexities. An optimal quantum design is to execute multiple search oracle in parallel on the quantum processing unit with a single-core that completely removes the multiplicative factor m, however, this method is impractical to design. We have no effective quantum solutions to process multiple patterns at present. Therefore, we propose quantum algorithms using quantum processing unit with C quantum cores working on shared quantum memory. This quantum parallel design would be effective for searching all t exact occurrences of each pattern. To our knowledge, no attempts have been made to design multiple pattern matching algorithms on quantum multicore processor. Thus, some quantum remarkable exact single pattern matching algorithms are enhanced here with their equivalent versions, namely enhanced quantum memory processing based exact algorithm and enhanced quantum-based combined exact algorithm for multiple pattern matching. Our quantum solutions find all t exact occurrences of each pattern inside the biological sequence in O((m/C)root N) and O((m/C)root t) time complexities. This article shows the hybrid simulation of quantum algorithms to validate quantum solutions. Our theoretical-experimental results justify the significant improvements that these algorithms outperform over the existing classical solutions and are proven effective in quantum counterparts.

TI Geometric distinguishability measures limit quantum channel estimation
   and discrimination
SO QUANTUM INFORMATION PROCESSING
AB Quantum channel estimation and discrimination are fundamentally related information processing tasks of interest in quantum information science. In this paper, we analyze these tasks by employing the right logarithmic derivative Fisher information and the geometric Renyi relative entropy, respectively, and we also identify connections between these distinguishability measures. A key result of our paper is that a chain-rule property holds for the right logarithmic derivative Fisher information and the geometric Renyi relative entropy for the interval alpha is an element of(0,1) of the Renyi parameter alpha. In channel estimation, these results imply a condition for the unattainability of Heisenberg scaling, while in channel discrimination, they lead to improved bounds on error rates in the Chernoff and Hoeffding error exponent settings. More generally, we introduce the amortized quantum Fisher information as a conceptual framework for analyzing general sequential protocols that estimate a parameter encoded in a quantum channel. We then use this framework, beyond the aforementioned application, to show that Heisenberg scaling is not possible when a parameter is encoded in a classical-quantum channel. We then identify a number of other conceptual and technical connections between the tasks of estimation and discrimination and the distinguishability measures involved in analyzing each. As part of this work, we present a detailed overview of the geometric Renyi relative entropy of quantum states and channels, as well as its properties, which may be of independent interest.

TI A driven Kerr oscillator with two-fold degeneracies for qubit protection
SO PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF
   AMERICA
AB We present the experimental finding of multiple simultaneous two -fold degeneracies in the spectrum of a Kerr oscillator subjected to a squeezing drive. This squeezing drive resulting from a three -wave mixing process, in combination with the Kerr interaction, creates an effective static two -well potential in the phase space rotating at half the frequency of the sinusoidal drive generating the squeezing. Remarkably, these degeneracies can be turned on -and -off on demand, as well as their number by simply adjusting the frequency of the squeezing drive. We find that when the detuning A between the frequency of the oscillator and the second subharmonic of the drive equals an even multiple of the Kerr coefficient K , A / K = 2 m , the oscillator displays m + 1 exact, parity -protected, spectral degeneracies, insensitive to the drive amplitude. These degeneracies can be explained by the unusual destructive interference of tunnel paths in the classically forbidden region of the double well static effective potential that models our experiment. Exploiting this interference, we measure a peaked enhancement of the incoherent well -switching lifetime, thus creating a protected cat qubit in the ground state manifold of our oscillator. Our results illustrate the relationship between degeneracies and noise protection in a driven quantum system.

TI Generating quantum dissonance via local operations
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF QUANTUM INFORMATION
AB Correlations may arise in quantum systems through various means, of which the most remarkable one is quantum entanglement. Additionally, there are systems that exhibit nonclassical correlations even in the absence of entanglement. Quantum dissonance refers to how Quantum Discord (QD) - the difference between the total correlation and the classical correlation in a given quantum state - appears as a nonclassical correlation in a system without entanglement. It could be said that QD has the potential to provide a more inclusive viewpoint for discerning the nonclassical correlations. In this paper, we address the problem of manipulating the QD between two subsystems through local operations. We propose two explicit procedures for obtaining separable Werner states, a type of mixed state with nonzero QD. Both approaches involve performing local operations on classically correlated states and offers a step-by-step method for obtaining separable Werner states with nonzero discord, providing an alternative (explicit and user-friendly) to existing methods.

TI Telecom-wavelength conversion in a high optical depth cold atomic system
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB We experimentally investigate the frequency down-conversion through the four-wave mixing (FWM) process in a cold 85Rb atomic ensemble, with a diamond-level configuration. An atomic cloud with a high optical depth (OD) of 190 is prepared to achieve a high efficiency frequency conversion. Here, we convert a signal pulse field (795 nm) attenuated to a single-photon level, into a telecom light at 1529.3 nm within near C-band range and the frequency-conversion efficiency can reach up to 32%. We find that the OD is an essential factor affecting conversion efficiency and the efficiency may exceed 32% with an improvement in the OD. Moreover, we note the signal-to-noise ratio of the detected telecom field is higher than 10 while the mean signal count is larger than 0.2. Our work may be combined with quantum memories based on cold 85Rb ensemble at 795 nm and serve for long-distance quantum networks.(c) 2023 Optica Publishing Group under the terms of the Optica Open Access Publishing Agreement

AB Traffic congestion is one of the major issues in urban areas, particularly when traffic loads exceed the road's capacity, resulting in higher petrol consumption and carbon emissions as well as delays and stress for road users. In Asia, the traffic situation can be further deteriorated by road sharing of scooters. How to control the traffic flow to mitigate the congestion has been one of the central issues in transportation research. In this study, we employ a quantum annealing approach to optimize the traffic signals control at a real-life intersection with mixed traffic flows of vehicles and scooters. Considering traffic flow is a continuous and emerging phenomenon, we used quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO) formalism for traffic optimization, which has a natural equivalence to the Ising model and can be solved efficiently on the quantum annealers, quantum computers or digital annealers. In this article, we first applied the QUBO traffic optimization to artificially generated traffic for a simple intersection, and then we used real-time traffic data to simulate a real "Dongda-Keyuan" intersection with dedicated cars and scooter lanes, as well as mixed scooter and car lanes. We introduced two types of traffic light control systems for traffic optimization: C-QUBO and QUBO. Our rigorous QUBO optimizations show that C-QUBO and QUBO outperform the commonly used fixed cycle method, with QUBO outperforming C-QUBO in some instances. It has been found that QUBO optimization significantly relieves traffic congestion for the unbalanced traffic volume. Furthermore, we found that dynamic changes in traffic light signal duration greatly reduce traffic congestion.

AB Using quantum technologies (QTs) to solve problems related to climate change is a key goal for many physicists at the research and development stage. Recent research anticipates numerous real-world applications for quantum technologies that will address climate change and further sustainable development goals. However, currently there is no guiding framework for implementing responsible, sustainable innovation, or criteria for evaluating the sustainability of QTs. The goal of this article is to augment previous responsible innovation (RI) analysis of, and recommendations for, quantum innovation by emphasizing sustainability as a key value. This article will also provide specific recommendations for developing sustainable QTs and criteria to assess the sustainability of QTs. With increases in funding for quantum innovation and the predicted operationality of many QTs in the coming decades, this is a key moment to discuss values and shape the quantum innovation trajectory. By using an RI approach with an added emphasis on sustainability, this article offers tools for developing responsible, sustainable QTs that are sensitive to the climate change context.

TI Designing gate operations for single-ion quantum computing in
   rare-earth-ion-doped crystals
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Quantum computers based on rare-earth-ion-doped crystals show promising properties in terms of scalability and connectivity if single ions can be used as qubits. Through simulations, we investigate gate operations on such qubits. We discuss how gate and system parameters affect gate errors, the required frequency bandwidth per qubit, and the risk for instantaneous spectral diffusion (ISD). Furthermore, we examine how uncertainties in the system parameters affect the gate errors, and how precisely the system needs to be known. We find gate errors for arbitrary single-qubit gates of 2.1 x 10(-4) when ISD is not considered and 3.4 x 10(-4) when we take heed to minimize it. Additionally, we construct two-qubit gates with errors ranging from 5 x 10(-4) -> 3 x 10(-3) over a broad range of dipole-dipole interaction strengths.

TI Adiabatic bottlenecks in quantum annealing and nonequilibrium dynamics
   of paramagnons
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB The correspondence between long-range interacting quantum spin glasses and combinatorial optimization problems underpins the physical motivation for adiabatic quantum computing. On one hand, in disordered (quantum) spin systems, the focus is on exact methods such as the replica trick that allow the calculation of system quantities in the limit of infinite system and ensemble size. On the other hand, when solving a given instance of an optimization problem, disorder-averaged quantities are of no relevance, as one is solely interested in instance-specific, finite-size properties, in particular the optimal solution. Here, we apply the nonequilibrium Green's function formalism to the spin coherent-state path integral to obtain the statistical fluctuations and the collective-excitation spectrum along the annealing path. For the example of the quantum Sherrington-Kirkpatrick spin glass, by comparing to extensive numerically exact results, we show that this method provides access to the instance-specific bottlenecks of the annealing protocol.

TI Multi-Channel Multi-Protocol Quantum Key Distribution System for Secure
   Image Transmission in Healthcare
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB Quantum key distribution (QKD) is a viable technique for safeguarding image transmission against numerous attacks. To address the limitations of existing methods in securing electronic medical records, we have explored an encryption technique using a set of real-time medical images along with existing standard images using QKD protocols including BB84 (Bennett-Brassard 1984), CASCADE (Cascading Error Correction Algorithm for Data Exchange), and differential-phase-shift (DPS) under the fiber-based (OFC) and free-space (FSO) channels. It utilizes the quantum bit-plane representation of the Real Ket (QBRK) model and a logistic chaotic system with XOR operation. The performance of the developed framework is tested via visual illustration and 11 different quantitative assessments. The average entropy of the scrambled image for the medical source image is 7.9896, which is quite near to the optimum value of 8. The UACI (Unified Averaged Changed Intensity) and the NPCR (Number of Pixels Change Rate) metric values lie between 33.7879 to 33.9711 and 99.6014 to 99.8000 for the FSO channel. The BB84 QKD protocol achieves a QBER (Quantum Bit Error Rate) of 0.0028 for an FSO channel with DCR (Dark Count Rate), which improves to 0.0012 when DCR is ignored for a 10 km link range. In addition, we analyzed and compared the effect of OFC on system output as the quantum channel. From several experiments, it is observed that the BB84 provides better results against CASCADE and DPS. The proposed work is validated using the OptiSystem 15.1 software under FSO and for OFC.

TI Photon-transmission-loss-independent quantum-enhanced interferometer
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB A quantum-enhanced telescope (interferometer) can have significant advantages in precisely measuring the angular position of remote objects through sending out ancillary quantum entanglement pairs alongside the large baselines of telescopes. In principle, the larger the baseline, the higher the expected measurement resolution. However, the well-known major problem of photon transmission loss would drastically undermine the practical application of all quantum-enhanced telescopes and optical interferometers that transmit photons along the baseline, especially for the large baselines required for high angular resolution. Here, we propose a photon-transmission-loss-independent quantum-enhanced interferometer that is robust to the transmission loss and keeps its advantages unchanged given whatever large baseline. This removes the well-known barrier to the practical application of quantum-enhanced telescopes. Moreover, in contrast to the previous results of quantumphoton-number-resolving detectors, or quantum memories-our method requires only threshold detectors and tunable coherent-state or two-mode squeezed-state sources, which are mature technologies nowadays, and it does not need any quantum memory. We demonstrate the high performance of our method using Fisher information. For the phase difference of weak light from a remote star, the high-quality result of Fisher information remains constant under arbitrarily large transmission loss, and hence all the advantageous results and the performance of our method are actually independent of transmission loss.

TI Quantum entanglement entropy of collective excitations in a
   quasi-one-dimensional Bose-Einstein condensate
SO ACTA PHYSICA SINICA
AB Quasi-particle excitation in a Bose-Einstein condensate leads to quantum entanglement between real bosonic atoms in the system. By using spectral expansion method, the eigenvalues and eigenstates of Bogoliubov-de Gennes equation are numerically calculated in a quasi-one-dimensional infinite square well potential. For the low-energy collective excitations of the quasi-particles, we explore the dependence of quantum entanglement entropy of the Bose-Einstein condensate on scattering length. Our results show that the entanglement entropy increases slowly with the increase of the scattering length, and such an increasing trend can be well described by a power function. These results are analogous to those in a one-dimensional uniform BEC, where the entanglement entropy of the Bogoliubov ground state is approximately proportional to the square root of the scattering length. This work provides a viable way for investigating many-particle entanglement in a quasi-one-dimensional trapped Bose-Einstein condensate where the quantum entanglement is closely related to the interaction strength between particles.

TI Effective Field Theory of Random Quantum Circuits
SO ENTROPY
AB Quantum circuits have been widely used as a platform to simulate generic quantum many-body systems. In particular, random quantum circuits provide a means to probe universal features of many-body quantum chaos and ergodicity. Some such features have already been experimentally demonstrated in noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices. On the theory side, properties of random quantum circuits have been studied on a case-by-case basis and for certain specific systems, and a hallmark of quantum chaos-universal Wigner-Dyson level statistics-has been derived. This work develops an effective field theory for a large class of random quantum circuits. The theory has the form of a replica sigma model and is similar to the low-energy approach to diffusion in disordered systems. The method is used to explicitly derive the universal random matrix behavior of a large family of random circuits. In particular, we rederive the Wigner-Dyson spectral statistics of the brickwork circuit model by Chan, De Luca, and Chalker [Phys. Rev. X 8, 041019 (2018)] and show within the same calculation that its various permutations and higher-dimensional generalizations preserve the universal level statistics. Finally, we use the replica sigma model framework to rederive the Weingarten calculus, which is a method of evaluating integrals of polynomials of matrix elements with respect to the Haar measure over compact groups and has many applications in the study of quantum circuits. The effective field theory derived here provides both a method to quantitatively characterize the quantum dynamics of random Floquet systems (e.g., calculating operator and entanglement spreading) and a path to understanding the general fundamental mechanism behind quantum chaos and thermalization in these systems.

TI Quantum annealing applications, challenges and limitations for
   optimisation problems compared to classical solvers
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB Quantum computing is rapidly advancing, harnessing the power of qubits' superposition and entanglement for computational advantages over classical systems. However, scalability poses a primary challenge for these machines. By implementing a hybrid workflow between classical and quantum computing instances, D-Wave has succeeded in pushing this boundary to the realm of industrial use. Furthermore, they have recently opened up to mixed integer linear programming (MILP) problems, expanding their applicability to many relevant problems in the field of optimisation. However, the extent of their suitability for diverse problem categories and their computational advantages remains unclear. This study conducts a comprehensive examination by applying a selection of diverse case studies to benchmark the performance of D-Wave's hybrid solver against that of industry-leading solvers such as CPLEX, Gurobi, and IPOPT. The findings indicate that D-Wave's hybrid solver is currently most advantageous for integer quadratic objective functions and shows potential for quadratic constraints. To illustrate this, we applied it to a real-world energy problem, specifically the MILP unit commitment problem. While D-Wave can solve such problems, its performance has not yet matched that of its classical counterparts.

TI Unitary Block-Correlated Coupled Cluster Ansatz Based on the Generalized
   Valence Bond Wave Function for Quantum Simulation
SO JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL THEORY AND COMPUTATION
AB Strongly correlated (SC) systems present significant challenges for classical quantum chemistry methods. Quantum computing, particularly the variational quantum eigensolver (VQE), offers a promising framework to address these challenges by inherently supporting exponentially large configuration spaces. However, its application to SC systems remains limited due to the single-reference nature of the widely used ansatzes such as unitary coupled cluster (UCC). To address this challenge, we propose the generalized valence bond-based unitary block correlated coupled cluster (GVB-UBCCC) method. This novel ansatz incorporates the multiconfigurational nature of generalized valence bond (GVB) and the accuracy of block correlated coupled cluster (BCCC) methods, making it well-suited for SC systems. We have implemented the GVB-UBCCC method with up to two-block correlation (GVB-UBCCC2) and applied it to investigate ground-state energies for several SC systems, including H4, the water dimer, N2H2, and S6, at most described by 24 qubits. Our approach demonstrates that for these systems, GVB-UBCCC2 can achieve more accurate ground-state energies than UCCSD in most cases while requiring only O(N 2) quantum gates and parameters, as opposed to the O(N 4) scaling of UCCSD. The results highlight the effectiveness and potential advantages of GVB-UBCCC in SC systems.

TI Correcting Spanning Errors With a Fractal Code
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INFORMATION THEORY
AB The strongly correlated systems we use to realise quantum error-correcting codes may give rise to high-weight, problematic errors. Encouragingly, we can expect local quantum error-correcting codes with no string-like logical operators - such as the cubic code - to be robust to highly correlated, one-dimensional errors that span their lattice. The challenge remains to design decoding algorithms that utilise the high distance of these codes. Here, we begin the development of such algorithms by proposing an efficient decoder for the 'Fibonacci code'; a two-dimensional classical code that mimics the fractal nature of the cubic code. Our iterative decoder finds a correction through repeated use of minimum-weight perfect matching by exploiting symmetries of the code. We perform numerical experiments that show our decoder is robust to one-dimensional, correlated errors. First, using a bit-flip noise model at low error rates, we find that our decoder demonstrates a logical failure rate that scales super exponentially in the linear size of the lattice. In contrast, a decoder that could not tolerate spanning errors would not achieve this rapid decay in failure rate with increasing system size. We also find a finite threshold using a spanning noise model that introduces string-like errors that stretch along full rows and columns of the lattice. These results provide direct evidence that our decoder is robust to one-dimensional, correlated errors that span the lattice.

TI Graph optimization perspective for low-depth Trotter-Suzuki
   decomposition
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Hamiltonian simulation represents an important module in a large class of quantum algorithms and simulations such as quantum machine learning, quantum linear algebra methods, and modeling for physics, material science, and chemistry. One of the most prominent methods for realizing the time-evolution unitary is via the Trotter-Suzuki decomposition. However, there is a large class of possible decompositions for the infinitesimal time-evolution operator as the order in which the Hamiltonian terms are implemented is arbitrary. We introduce a perspective for generating a low-depth Trotter-Suzuki decomposition assuming the standard Clifford+RZ gate set by adapting ideas from quantum error correction. We map a given Trotter-Suzuki decomposition to a constrained path on a graph which we deem the Pauli frame graph (PFG). Each node of the PFG represents the set of possible Hamiltonian terms currently available to be applied, Clifford operations represent a move from one node to another, and so the graph distance represents the gate cost of implementing the decomposition. The problem of finding the optimal decomposition is then equivalent to solving a problem similar to the traveling salesman. Although this is an NP-hard problem, we demonstrate the simplest heuristic, greedy search, and compare the resulting two-qubit gate count and circuit depth to more standard methods for a large class of scientifically relevant Hamiltonians, both fermionic and bosonic, found in chemical, vibrational, and condensed-matter problems which naturally scale. We find, in nearly every case we study, the resulting depth and two-qubit gate counts are less than those provided by standard methods, by as much as an order of magnitude. We also find the method is efficient and amenable to parallelization, making it scalable for problems of real interest.

TI Quantum Fourier transform to estimate drive cycles
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB Drive cycles in vehicle systems are important determinants for energy consumption, emissions, and safety. Estimating the frequency of the drive cycle quickly is important for control applications related to fuel efficiency, emission reduction and improving safety. Quantum computing has established the computational efficiency that can be gained. A drive cycle frequency estimation algorithm based on the quantum Fourier transform is exponentially faster than the classical Fourier transform. The algorithm is applied on real world data set. We evaluate the method using a quantum computing simulator, demonstrating remarkable consistency with the results from the classical Fourier transform. Current quantum computers are noisy, a simple method is proposed to mitigate the impact of the noise. The method is evaluated on a 15 qubit IBM-q quantum computer. The proposed method for a noisy quantum computer is still faster than the classical Fourier transform.

TI Experimental study of decoherence of the two-mode squeezed vacuum state
   via second harmonic generation
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Decoherence remains one of the most serious challenges to the implementation of quantum technology. It appears as a result of the transformation over time of a quantum superposition state into a classical mixture due to the quantum system interacting with the environment. Since quantum systems are never completely isolated from their environment, decoherence therefore cannot be avoided in realistic situations. Decoherence has been extensively studied, mostly theoretically, because it has many important implications in quantum technology, such as in the fields of quantum information processing, quantum communication, and quantum computation. Here we report a novel experimental scheme on the study of decoherence of a two-mode squeezed vacuum state via its second harmonic generation signal. Our scheme can directly extract the decoherence of the phase-sensitive quantum correlation <(a) over cap(b) over cap > between two entangled modes a and b. Such a correlation is the most important characteristic of a two-mode squeezed state. More importantly, this is an experimental study on the decoherence effect of a squeezed vacuum state, which has been rarely investigated.

TI FOLLOWING FORRELATION - QUANTUM ALGORITHMS IN EXPLORING BOOLEAN
   FUNCTIONS' SPECTRA
SO ADVANCES IN MATHEMATICS OF COMMUNICATIONS
AB Here we revisit the quantum algorithms for obtaining Forrelation [Aaronson et al., 2015] values to evaluate some of the well-known cryptograph-ically significant spectra of Boolean functions, namely the Walsh spectrum, the cross-correlation spectrum, and the autocorrelation spectrum. We introduce the existing 2-fold Forrelation formulation with bent duality-based promise problems as desirable instantiations. Next, we concentrate on the 3-fold ver-sion through two approaches. First, we judiciously set up some of the func-tions in 3-fold Forrelation so that given oracle access, one can sample from the Walsh Spectrum of f. Using this, we obtain improved results than what one can achieve by exploiting the Deutsch-Jozsa algorithm. In turn, it has implications in resiliency checking. Furthermore, we use a similar idea to ob-tain a technique in estimating the cross-correlation (and thus autocorrelation) value at any point, improving upon the existing algorithms. Finally, we tweak the quantum algorithm with the superposition of linear functions to obtain a cross-correlation sampling technique. This is the first cross-correlation sam-pling algorithm with constant query complexity to the best of our knowledge. This also provides a strategy to check if two functions are uncorrelated of de-gree m. We further modify this using Dicke states so that the time complexity reduces, particularly for constant values of m.

TI Linking QKD Testbeds across Europe
SO ENTROPY
AB Quantum-key-distribution (QKD) networks are gaining importance and it has become necessary to analyze the most appropriate methods for their long-distance interconnection. In this paper, four different methods of interconnecting remote QKD networks are proposed. The methods are used to link three different QKD testbeds in Europe, located in Berlin, Madrid, and Poznan. Although long-distance QKD links are only emulated, the methods used can serve as a blueprint for the secure interconnection of distant QKD networks in the future. Specifically, the presented approaches combine, in a transparent way, different fiber and satellite physical media, as well as common standards of key delivery interfaces. The testbed interconnections are designed to increase the security by utilizing multipath techniques and multiple hybridizations of QKD and post-quantum cryptography (PQC) algorithms.

AB Quantum computing is newly emerging information-processing technology which is foreseen to be exponentially faster than classical supercomputers. Current quantum processors are nevertheless very limited in their availability and performance and many important software tools for them do not exist yet. Therefore, various systems are studied by simulating the run of quantum computers. Building upon our previous experience with quantum computing of small molecular systems (see I. Mihalikova et al., Molecules 27 (2022) 597, and I. Mihalikova et al., Nanomaterials 2022, 12, 243), we have recently focused on computing electronic structure of periodic crystalline materials. Being inspired by the work of Cerasoli et al. (Phys. Chem. Chem. Phys., 2020, 22, 21816), we have used hybrid variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) algorithm, which combined classical and quantum information processing. Employing tight-binding type of crystal description, we present our results for crystalline diamond-structure silicon. In particular, we focus on the states along the lowest occupied band within the electronic structure of Si and compare the results with values obtained by classical means. While we demonstrate an excellence agreement between classical and quantum-computed results in most of our calculations, we further critically check the sensitivity of our results with respect to computational set-up in our quantum-computing study. A few results were obtained also using quantum processors provided by the IBM.

TI Equivalence checking of quantum circuits by nonlocality
SO NPJ QUANTUM INFORMATION
AB Suppose two quantum circuit chips are located at different places, for which we do not have any prior knowledge, and cannot see the internal structures either. In such a situation, a realistic and fundamental problem is to find out whether they have the same functions or not with certainty. In this paper, we show that this problem can be solved completely from the viewpoint of quantum nonlocality. Specifically, we design an elegant protocol that examines underlying quantum nonlocality, where the strongest nonlocality can be observed if and only if two quantum circuits are equivalent to each other. We show that the protocol also works approximately, where the distance between two quantum circuits can be calculated accurately by observing quantum nonlocality in an analytical manner. Furthermore, it turns out that the computational cost of our protocol is independent of the size of compared quantum circuits. Lastly, we also discuss the possibility to generalize the protocol to multipartite cases, i.e., if we do equivalence checking for multiple quantum circuits, we try to solve the problem in one go.

   Qudit Codes From Dual-Containing Classical Codes
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON QUANTUM ENGINEERING
AB Quantum code construction from two classical codes D-1[n, k(1), d(1)] and D-2[n, k(2), d(2)] over the field F-p(m) ( p is prime and m is an integer) satisfying the dual containing criteria D-1(perpendicular to) subset of D-2 using the Calderbank-Shor-Steane (CSS) framework is well-studied. We show that the generalization of the CSS framework for qubits to qudits yields two different classes of codes, namely, the F-p-linear CSS codes and the well-known F-p(m)-linear CSS codes based on the check matrix-based definition and the coset-based definition of CSS codes over qubits. Our contribution to this article are three-folds. 1) We study the properties of the F-p-linear and F-p(m)-linear CSS codes and demonstrate the tradeoff for designing codes with higher rates or better error detection and correction capability, useful for quantum systems. 2) For F-p(m)-linear CSS codes, we provide the explicit form of the check matrix and show that the minimum distances d(x) and d(z) are equal to d(2) and d(1), respectively, if and only if the code is nondegenerate. 3) We propose two classes of quantum codes obtained from the codes D-1 and D-2, where one code is an F-p(l) -linear code (l divides m) and the other code is obtained from a particular subgroup of the stabilizer group of the Fp(m)(-)linear CSS code. Within each class of codes, we demonstrate the tradeoff between higher rates and better error detection and correction capability.

TI Quantum Simulation of Molecular Dynamics Processes-A Benchmark Study
   Using a Classical Simulator and Present-Day Quantum Hardware
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY A
AB We explore how the fundamental problems in quantum molecular dynamics can be modeled using classical simulators (emulators) of quantum computers and the actual quantum hardware available to us today. The list of problems we tackle includes propagation of a free wave packet, vibration of a harmonic oscillator, and tunneling through a barrier. Each of these problems starts with the initial wave packet setup. Although Qiskit provides a general method for initializing wave functions, in most cases it generates deep quantum circuits. While these circuits perform well on noiseless simulators, they suffer from excessive noise on quantum hardware. To overcome this issue, we designed a shallower quantum circuit for preparing a Gaussian-like initial wave packet, which improves the performance of real hardware. Next, quantum circuits are implemented to apply the kinetic and potential energy operators for the evolution of a wave function over time. The results of our modeling on classical emulators of quantum hardware agree perfectly with the results obtained using the traditional (classical) methods. This serves as a benchmark and demonstrates that the quantum algorithms and Qiskit codes we developed are accurate. However, the results obtained on the actual quantum hardware available today, such as IBM's superconducting qubits and IonQ's trapped ions, indicate large discrepancies due to hardware limitations. This work highlights both the potential and challenges of using quantum computers to solve fundamental quantum molecular dynamics problems.

TI Spin-photon interaction between a ruby crystal and a
   high-critical-temperature superconducting microwave cavity
SO COMMUNICATIONS PHYSICS
AB High-spin systems in molecules and inorganic solids hold significant potential for advancing quantum information storage and processing technologies, owing to their multilevel structure. However, the dynamics of spin-photon interactions in these systems remain underexplored in practical device settings. Here we investigate the quantum properties of an S = 3/2 spin ensemble in a ruby crystal embedded in a high-Tc superconducting microwave cavity. Using electron spin resonance techniques, we measure the coupling strength between the quantized electromagnetic mode of the cavity and the spin ensemble across a broad temperature range and for various crystal axis orientations relative to the applied magnetic field. The coupling strength, governed by thermal polarization of the spins and quantum mechanical transition probabilities, shows quantitative agreement with theoretical predictions based on spin Hamiltonian diagonalization and electromagnetic simulations of the cavity mode. These findings establish impurity spins in solids as controllable multilevel quantum systems and provide critical insights into the factors influencing spin-cavity interactions. This work opens new avenues for optimizing quantum information processing and developing versatile quantum technologies based on high-spin systems.

TI Emission and coherent control of Levitons in graphene
SO SCIENCE
AB Flying qubits encode quantum information in propagating modes instead of stationary discrete states. Although photonic flying qubits are available, the weak interaction between photons limits the efficiency of conditional quantum gates. Conversely, electronic flying qubits can use Coulomb interactions, but the weaker quantum coherence in conventional semiconductors has hindered their realization. In this work, we engineered on-demand injection of a single electronic flying qubit state and its manipulation over the Bloch sphere. The flying qubit is a Leviton propagating in quantum Hall edge channels of a high-mobility graphene monolayer. Although single-shot qubit readout and two-qubit operations are still needed for a viable manipulation of flying qubits, the coherent manipulation of an itinerant electronic state at the single-electron level presents a highly promising alternative to conventional qubits.

TI Thermal quantum information capacity in a topological insulator
SO QUANTUM INFORMATION PROCESSING
AB Thermal effects in a one-dimensional Su-Schrieffer-Hegger topological insulator are studied. Particularly, we focus on quantum information processing capacity for thermal ensembles. To evaluate quantum information processing, an optimized quantum Fisher information is introduced as a quantifier of entanglement and topological phases are calculated by a definition in real space for the electric polarization of mixture states. For the thermal ensemble, there is a relationship between the Fisher metric and the electric polarization in such a way that in the topological region, there is more entanglement, and therefore, creates more robustness and protection in the quantum information against to thermal effects. Moreover, long-range hopping effects are studied and it is found that in this case, the optimized quantum Fisher information captures these topological phase transitions in the limit of low temperature by the formalism in real space.

On the basis of the proposed method energy levels of spin systems are found on IBM's quantum computer ibmq-bogota, among them are spin chain in magnetic field, triangle spin cluster, Ising model on squared lattice, a spin in magnetic field. The results of quantum calculations are in agreement with the theoretical ones. The method is efficient for estimation of the energy levels of many-spin systems and opens a possibility to achieve quantum supremacy in solving eigenvalue problem with development of multi-qubit quantum computers.

TI N-way parametric frequency beamsplitter for quantum photonics
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Optical networks are the leading platform for the transfer of information due to their low loss and ability to scale to many information channels using optical frequency modes. To fully leverage the quantum properties of light in this platform, it is desired to manipulate higher-dimensional superpositions by orchestrating linear, beamsplitter-type interactions between several channels simultaneously. We propose a method of achieving simultaneous, all-to-all coupling between N optical frequency modes via N-way Bragg-scattering four-wave mixing. By exploiting the frequency degree of freedom, additional modes can be multiplexed in an interaction medium of fixed volume and loss while avoiding the introduction of excess noise. We generalize the theory of the frequency-encoded two-mode interaction to N modes under this four-wave-mixing approach, finding that arbitrary unitary transformations are possible through successive four-wave-mixing pump configurations. We experimentally verify the quantum nature of this scheme by demonstrating three-way multiphoton interference. Two input photons are shared among three frequency modes and display interference differing from that of two classical (coherent-state) inputs. These results show the potential of our approach for the scalability of photonic quantum information processing to general N-mode systems in the frequency domain.

While current QKD systems are mainly based on attenuated laser pulses, deterministic single -photon sources could give concrete advantages in terms of secret key rate (SKR) and security owing to the negligible probability of multi-photon events. Here, we introduce and demonstrate a proof-of-concept QKD system exploiting a molecule-based single-photon source operating at room temperature and emitting at 785 nm. With an estimated maximum SKR of 0.5 Mbps, our solution paves the way for room-temperature single-photon sources for quantum communication protocols.

TI Dissipative qutrit-mediated stable charging
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB In this work, we propose a stable charging scheme mediated by a three-level system (qutrit), which renders a unidirectional energy flow from an external power source to an (N + 1)-dimensional quantum battery. By virtue of the qutrit dissipation, the battery avoids the spontaneous discharging induced by the time-reversal symmetry of any unitary-charging scheme. Irrespective of the initial state, the battery can be eventually stabilized at the maximal-ergotropy state as long as the charger-battery interaction is present. We use a Dyson series of Lindbladian superoperator to obtain an effective master equation for the battery, which is found to be equivalent to the high-order Fermi's golden rule adapted to the non-Hermitian Hamiltonian and spontaneous decay. We extract the optimization condition for charging efficiency and justify it in the finite-size battery with uniform energy splitting, the large spin battery, and the truncated harmonic-oscillator battery.

TI No invariant perfect qubit codes
SO JOURNAL OF HIGH ENERGY PHYSICS
AB Perfect tensors describe highly entangled quantum states that have attracted particular attention in the fields of quantum information theory and quantum gravity. In loop quantum gravity, the natural question arises whether SU(2) invariant tensors, which are fundamental ingredients of the basis states of spacetime, can also be perfect. In this work, we present a number of general constraints for the layout of such invariant perfect tensors (IPTs) and further describe a systematic and constructive approach to check the existence of an IPT of given valence. We apply our algorithm to show that no qubit encoding of valence 6 can be described by an IPT and close a gap to prove a no-go theorem for invariant perfect qubit encodings. We also provide two alternative proofs for the non-existence of 4-valent qubit IPTs which has been shown in [1, 2].

TI Postdecay quantum entanglement in top pair production
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW D
AB Top pairs produced at the Large Hadron Collider exhibit quantum entanglement of their spins near threshold and for boosted, central t (t) over bar pairs. The entanglement is maintained between the decay products, in particular, between the top quark and the W- boson from the antiquark (or vice versa, between (t) over bar and W+) in certain kinematical regions. Therefore, t (t) over bar production provides a rare opportunity to verify the spin entanglement between a fermion and a boson. The tW entanglement can be probed at the 7 sigma level near threshold with run 2 data and at the 5 sigma level in the boosted region with the foreseen run 3 luminosity. In addition, the entanglement between the two W bosons can be probed at the 4 sigma level at the LHC run 3.

TI Measurement-Induced Entanglement and Complexity in Random Constant-Depth
   2D Quantum Circuits
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW X
AB We analyze the entanglement structure of states generated by random constant-depth two-dimensional quantum circuits, followed by projective measurements of a subset of sites. By deriving a rigorous lower bound on the average entanglement entropy of such postmeasurement states, we prove that macroscopic long-ranged entanglement is generated above some constant critical depth in several natural classes of circuit architectures, which include brickwork circuits and random holographic tensor networks. This behavior had been conjectured based on previous works, which utilize nonrigorous methods such as replica theory calculations, or work in regimes where the local Hilbert space dimension grows with system size. To establish our lower bound, we develop new replica-free theoretical techniques that leverage tools from multiuser quantum information theory, which are of independent interest, allowing us to map the problem onto a statistical mechanics model of self-avoiding walks without requiring large local Hilbert space dimension. Our findings have consequences for the complexity of classically simulating sampling from random shallow circuits and of contracting tensor networks. First, we show that standard algorithms based on matrix product states which are used for both these tasks will fail above some constant depth and bond dimension, respectively. In addition, we also prove that these random constant-depth quantum circuits cannot be simulated by any classical circuit of sublogarithmic depth.

Furthermore, we present methods of constructing Hermitian linear complementary dual (HLCD) codes from known HSO codes, and obtain many HLCD codes with good parameters. As an application, 31 classes of entanglement-assisted quantum error correction codes (EAQECCs) with maximal entanglement can be obtained from these HLCD codes. These new EAQECCs have better parameters than those in the literature.

TI Efficient quantum simulation of open quantum dynamics at various
   Hamiltonians and spectral densities
SO FRONTIERS OF PHYSICS
AB Simulation of open quantum dynamics for various Hamiltonians and spectral densities are ubiquitous for studying various quantum systems. On a quantum computer, only log(2)N qubits are required for the simulation of an N-dimensional quantum system, hence simulation in a quantum computer can greatly reduce the computational complexity compared with classical methods. Recently, a quantum simulation approach was proposed for studying photosynthetic light harvesting [npj Quantum Inf. 4, 52 (2018)]. In this paper, we apply the approach to simulate the open quantum dynamics of various photosynthetic systems. We show that for Drude-Lorentz spectral density, the dimerized geometries with strong couplings within the donor and acceptor clusters respectively exhibit significantly improved efficiency. We also demonstrate that the overall energy transfer can be optimized when the energy gap between the donor and acceptor clusters matches the optimum of the spectral density. The effects of different types of baths, e.g., Ohmic, sub-Ohmic, and super-Ohmic spectral densities are also studied. The present investigations demonstrate that the proposed approach is universal for simulating the exact quantum dynamics of photosynthetic systems.

TI Protocols for intermodule two-qubit gates mediated by time-bin encoded
   photons
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB As quantum devices scale to larger numbers of qubits, entangling gates between distant stationary qubits will help provide flexible, long-range connectivity in modular architectures. In this work, we present protocols for implementing long-range two-qubit gates mediated by either Fock-state or time-bin qubits-photonic encodings that are both compatible with the coplanar waveguide resonators commonly used in circuit quantum electrodynamics (QED). These protocols become deterministic in the limit of vanishing photon loss. Additionally, photon loss can be heralded, signaling a failed two-qubit gate attempt. We model the loss of a time-bin qubit to a dielectric environment consisting of an ensemble of two-level systems, which are believed to be the dominant mechanism for dielectric loss in circuit QED architectures. The backaction (on the stationary qubits) associated with the loss of the time-bin qubit is strongly suppressed in a non-Markovian regime where the temporal separation of the time bins is short compared to the dielectric environment's correlation time. This result suggests strategies based on a combination of materials-fabrication and time-bin-qubit optimization for ensuring that the loss of a time-bin qubit is not only heralded but also approximately backaction-free.

TI Approximating the quantum approximate optimization algorithm with
   digital-analog interactions
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB The quantum approximate optimization algorithm was proposed as a heuristic method for solving combi-natorial optimization problems on near-term quantum computers and may be among the first algorithms to perform useful computations in the postsupremacy, noisy, intermediate-scale era of quantum computing. In this work we exploit the recently proposed digital-analog quantum computation paradigm, in which the versatility of programmable universal quantum computers and the error resilience of quantum simulators are combined to improve platforms for quantum computation. We show that the digital-analog paradigm is suited to the quantum approximate optimization algorithm due to the algorithm's variational resilience against the coherent errors introduced by the scheme. By performing large-scale simulations and providing analytical bounds for its performance in devices with finite single-qubit operation time we observe regimes of single-qubit operation speed in which the considered variational algorithm provides a significant improvement over nonvariational counterparts in the digital-analog scheme.

TI Ultimate limits of thermal pattern recognition
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Quantum channel discrimination presents a fundamental task in quantum information theory, with critical applications in quantum reading, illumination, data readout, and more. The extension to multiple quantum channel discrimination has seen a recent focus to characterize potential quantum advantage associated with quantum-enhanced discriminatory protocols. In this paper, we study thermal imaging as an environment localization task, in which thermal images are modeled as ensembles of Gaussian phase insensitive channels with identical transmissivity, and pixels possess properties according to background (cold) or target (warm) thermal channels. Via the teleportation stretching of adaptive quantum protocols, we derive ultimate limits on the precision of pattern classification of abstract, binary thermal image spaces, and show that quantum-enhanced strategies may be used to provide significant quantum advantage over known optimal classical strategies. The environmental conditions and necessary resources for which advantage may be obtained are studied and discussed. We then numerically investigate the use of quantum-enhanced statistical classifiers, where quantum sensors are used in conjunction with machine-learning image classification methods. Proving definitive advantage in the low-loss regime, this work motivates the use of quantum-enhanced sources for short-range thermal imaging and detection techniques for future quantum technologies.

TI Device-Independent Quantum Key Distribution Based on the Mermin-Peres
   Magic Square Game
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB Device-independent quantum key distribution (DIQKD) is information-theoretically secure against adversaries who possess a scalable quantum computer and who have supplied malicious key-establishment systems; however, the DIQKD key rate is currently too low. Consequently, we devise a DIQKD scheme based on the quantum nonlocal Mermin-Peres magic square game: our scheme asymptotically delivers DIQKD against collective attacks, even with noise. Our scheme outperforms DIQKD using the Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt game with respect to the number of game rounds, albeit not number of entangled pairs, provided that both state visibility and detection efficiency are high enough.

TI Dynamical second-order noise sweetspots in resonantly driven spin qubits
SO QUANTUM
AB Quantum dot-based quantum computation employs extensively the exchange interaction between nearby electronic spins in order to manipulate and couple different qubits. The exchange interaction, however, couples the qubit states to charge noise, which reduces the fidelity of the quantum gates that employ it. The effect of charge noise can be mitigated by working at noise sweetspots in which the sensitivity to charge variations is reduced. In this work we study the response to charge noise of a double quantum dot based qubit in the presence of ac gates, with arbitrary driving amplitudes, applied either to the dot levels or to the tunneling barrier. Tuning with an ac driving allows to manipulate the sign and strength of the exchange interaction as well as its coupling to environmental electric noise. Moreover, we show the possibility of inducing a second-order sweetspot in the resonant spin-triplet qubit in which the dephasing time is significantly increased.

TI Mitigating errors in logical qubits
SO COMMUNICATIONS PHYSICS
AB Quantum error correcting codes can enable large quantum computations provided physical error rates are sufficiently low. We combine post-selection with surface code error correction through the use of exclusive decoders, which abort on decoding instances that are deemed too difficult. For the most discriminating of exclusive decoders, we demonstrate a threshold of 50% under depolarizing noise (or 32(1)% for the fault-tolerant case), and up to a quadratic improvement in logical failure rates below threshold. Furthermore, with a modest exclusion criterion, we identify a regime at low error rates where the exclusion rate decays with code distance, providing a pathway for scalable and time-efficient quantum computing with post-selection. Our exclusive decoder applied to magic state distillation yields a 75% reduction in the number of physical qubits, and a 60% reduction in the total spacetime volume, including accounting for repetitions. Other applications include error mitigation, and in concatenated schemes.
   Quantum error correction produces an enormous amount of data about the quantum system, including information about whether an uncorrectable error is likely. In this work the authors analyse a new decoder that can abort when decoding is deemed too difficult, yielding improved performance overall.

TI Quantum algorithm for the Navier-Stokes equations by using the
   streamfunction-vorticity formulation and the lattice Boltzmann method
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF QUANTUM INFORMATION
AB In this paper, a new algorithm for solving the Navier-Stokes equations (NSE) on a quantum device is presented. For the fluid flow equations, the stream function-vorticity formulation is adopted, while the lattice Boltzmann method (LBM) is utilized for solving the corresponding system of equations numerically for one time step. Following the nature of the lattice Boltzmann method, the proposed quantum algorithm consists of five major sections: initialization, collision, propagation, boundary condition implementation and calculation of macroscopic quantities. The collision and boundary condition step is quantumly implemented by applying the standard-form encoding approach, while the quantum walk procedure is applied for the propagation step. The algorithm is implemented by using IBM's quantum computing software development framework Qiskit, while for the verification purposes, two-dimensional (2D) cavity flow is simulated and compared with classical code.

TI Universal Singlet-Triplet Qubits Implemented Near the Transverse Sweet
   Spot
SO ANNALEN DER PHYSIK
AB The key to realizing fault-tolerant quantum computation for singlet-triplet (ST) qubits in semiconductor double quantum dot (DQD) is to operate both the single- and two-qubit gates with high fidelity. The feasible way includes operating the qubit near the transverse sweet spot (TSS) to reduce the leading order of the noise, as well as adopting the proper pulse sequences which are immune to noise. The single-qubit gates can be achieved by introducing an AC drive on the detuning near the TSS. The large dipole moment of the DQDs at the TSS has enabled strong coupling between the qubits and the cavity resonator, which leads to two-qubit entangling gates. When operating in the proper region and applying modest pulse sequences, both single- and two-qubit gates have fidelity higher than 99%. The results in this paper suggest that taking advantage of the appropriate pulse sequences near the TSS can be effective to obtain high-fidelity ST qubits.

TI Unconventional quantum annealing methods for difficult trial problems
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB We consider a range of unconventional modifications to quantum annealing (QA), applied to an artificial trial problem with continuously tunable difficulty. In this problem, inspired by "transverse field chaos" in larger systems, classical and quantum methods are steered toward a false local minimum. To go from this local minimum to the global minimum, all N spins must flip, making this problem exponentially difficult to solve. We numerically study this problem by using a variety of new methods from the literature: inhomogeneous driving, adding transverse couplers, and other types of coherent oscillations in the transverse field terms (collectively known as RFQA, which stands for Random Field Quantum Annealing or Radio Frequency Quantum Annealing). We show that all of these methods improve the scaling of the time to solution (relative to the standard uniform sweep evolution) in at least some regimes. Comparison of these methods could help identify promising paths towards a demonstrable quantum speedup over classical algorithms in solving some realistic problems with near-term quantum annealing hardware.

We develop a multimode surface acoustic wave (SAW) resonator with a superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID) integrated in one of the Bragg reflectors. The interaction with the SQUID-shunted mirror gives rise to coupling between the more than 20 accessible resonator modes. We exploit this coupling to demonstrate two-mode squeezing of SAW phonons, as well as four-mode multipartite entanglement. Our results open avenues for continuous-variable quantum computing in a compact hybrid quantum system.

TI Experimental Observation of Tensor Monopoles with a Superconducting
   Qudit
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB Monopoles play a center role in gauge theories and topological matter. There are two fundamental types of monopoles in physics: vector monopoles and tensor monopoles. Examples of vector monopoles include the Dirac monopole in three dimensions and Yang monopole in five dimensions, which have been extensively studied and observed in condensed matter or artificial systems. However, tensor monopoles are less studied, and their observation has not been reported. Here we experimentally construct a tunable spin-1 Hamiltonian to generate a tensor monopole and then measure its unique features with superconducting quantum circuits. The energy structure of a 4D Weyl-like Hamiltonian with threefold degenerate points acting as tensor monopoles is imaged. Through quantum-metric measurements, we report the first experiment that measures the Dixmier-Douady invariant, the topological charge of the tensor monopole. Moreover, we observe topological phase transitions characterized by the topological Dixmier-Douady invariant, rather than the Chern numbers as used for conventional monopoles in odd-dimensional spaces.

CL London, ENGLAND
AB Quantum computational models enable the design of algorithms that are often significantly more efficient than their most competitive counterpart classical solutions. Recently, strides have been made to take advantage of the quantum computational framework in tackling problems arising in the context of text processing. Our work fits in such a research direction. We focused on challenges arising from string comparison problems and, specifically, on the alignment of fixed-length substrings that are found within two input strings. To be precise, given two input strings, x and y, both of length n, and a value d <= n, we want to verify the following conditions: the existence of a common prefix of length d, the presence of a common substring of length d starting at position j (with 0 <= j < n) and, the presence of any common substring of length d starting at the same position of both strings. Such problems find applications as sub-procedures in a variety of problems concerning text processing and sequence analysis. Notably, our approach yields polylogarithmic solutions, a stark contrast to the linear complexity inherent in the best classical alternatives.

AB It is well-established that Shor's algorithm can solve the discrete logarithm problem (DLP) in polynomial time. The hyperelliptic curve DLP (HCDLP) of genus 2 has found widespread industrial applications and remains an active research domain. In this work, we develop a quantum algorithm for solving HCDLP over binary fields F2n\documentclass[12pt]{minimal} \usepackage{amsmath} \usepackage{wasysym} \usepackage{amsfonts} \usepackage{amssymb} \usepackage{amsbsy} \usepackage{mathrsfs} \usepackage{upgreek} \setlength{\oddsidemargin}{-69pt} \begin{document}$$\mathbb {F}_{2<^>n}$$\end{document} by adapting Shor's algorithmic framework. The core innovation lies in our divisor addition implementation, which combines the geometric interpretation of divisor operations with symmetric polynomial techniques. Using representative parameters (n=163,283,571\documentclass[12pt]{minimal} \usepackage{amsmath} \usepackage{wasysym} \usepackage{amsfonts} \usepackage{amssymb} \usepackage{amsbsy} \usepackage{mathrsfs} \usepackage{upgreek} \setlength{\oddsidemargin}{-69pt} \begin{document}$$n = 163, 283, 571$$\end{document}), we quantify the required quantum resources from the perspective of minimal qubit count, minimal T-gate usage, and minimal quantum depth. Furthermore, we compare the quantum resources required for solving HCDLP over binary fields with those for solving HCDLP over general prime fields and demonstrate the vulnerability of HCDLP-based cryptosystems to quantum attacks. Our analysis reveals that: (1) solving HCDLP over binary fields requires fewer quantum gates and less quantum depth compared to solving it over general prime fields; (2) the maximum achievable quantum depth for HCDLP attacks falls below NIST's minimum security threshold of 240\documentclass[12pt]{minimal} \usepackage{amsmath} \usepackage{wasysym} \usepackage{amsfonts} \usepackage{amssymb} \usepackage{amsbsy} \usepackage{mathrsfs} \usepackage{upgreek} \setlength{\oddsidemargin}{-69pt} \begin{document}$$2<^>{40}$$\end{document} for comparable protection levels, and (3) the quantum computational cost is orders of magnitude lower than the 2157\documentclass[12pt]{minimal} \usepackage{amsmath} \usepackage{wasysym} \usepackage{amsfonts} \usepackage{amssymb} \usepackage{amsbsy} \usepackage{mathrsfs} \usepackage{upgreek} \setlength{\oddsidemargin}{-69pt} \begin{document}$$2<^>{157}$$\end{document} resources needed for AES-128 attacks.
