TI Probing Atomic 'Quantum Grating' by Collisions with Charged Particles
SO ATOMS
AB The wave function of an atom, which passed through a diffraction grating, is characterized by a regular space structure. Correspondingly, the interaction of another particle with this atom can be viewed as scattering on an 'atomic quantum grating' made of just a single atom. Probing this 'grating' by collisions with a charged projectile reveals few-body interference phenomena caused by the coherent contributions of its 'slits' to the transition amplitude (the superposition principle) and quantum entanglement of the particles involved. In particular, the spectra of electrons emitted from the atom in collisions with swift ions exhibit a pronounced interference pattern whose shape can be extremely sensitive to the collision velocity.

TI Generation of four-mode cluster states based on cascade four-wave mixing
   process
SO ACTA PHYSICA SINICA
AB As a crucial quantum resource for quantum computing and quantum information processing, cluster state has attracted extensive attention due to its unique entanglement properties and rich structures. In this work, we theoretically propose a scheme for generating four-mode entangled states based on cascaded four-wave mixing (FWM) process. The internal entanglement characteristics are studied by using the positivity under partial transposition criterion and eigenmode decomposition. In addition, the output entangled states are reconstructed and optimized by adjusting the relative phase of balanced homodyne detection and postprocessing the signal noise, and finally three four-mode cluster states with different structures are generated. Such a method can effectively reduce the excess noise induced by finite squeezing. Our theoretical results provide a reliable way of generating scalable continuous variable cluster states based on FWM process in atomic ensemble.

TI Quantum-inspired clustering with light
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB This article introduces a novel approach to perform the simulation of a single qubit quantum-inspired algorithm using laser beams. Leveraging the polarization states of photonic qubits, and inspired by variational quantum eigensolvers, we develop a variational quantum-inspired algorithm implementing a clustering procedure following the approach proposed by some of us in SciRep 13, 13284 (2023). A key aspect of our research involves the utilization of non-orthogonal states within the photonic domain, harnessing the potential of polarization schemes to reproduce unitary circuits. By mapping these non-orthogonal states into polarization states, we achieve an efficient and versatile quantum information processing unit which serves as a clustering device for a diverse set of datasets.

TI Entangled photon pair generation in an integrated SiC platform
SO LIGHT-SCIENCE & APPLICATIONS
AB Entanglement plays a vital role in quantum information processing. Owing to its unique material properties, silicon carbide recently emerged as a promising candidate for the scalable implementation of advanced quantum information processing capabilities. To date, however, only entanglement of nuclear spins has been reported in silicon carbide, while an entangled photon source, whether it is based on bulk or chip-scale technologies, has remained elusive. Here, we report the demonstration of an entangled photon source in an integrated silicon carbide platform for the first time. Specifically, strongly correlated photon pairs are efficiently generated at the telecom C-band wavelength through implementing spontaneous four-wave mixing in a compact microring resonator in the 4H-silicon-carbide-on-insulator platform. The maximum coincidence-to-accidental ratio exceeds 600 at a pump power of 0.17 mW, corresponding to a pair generation rate of (9 +/- 1) x 103 pairs/s. Energy-time entanglement is created and verified for such signal-idler photon pairs, with the two-photon interference fringes exhibiting a visibility larger than 99%. The heralded single-photon properties are also measured, with the heralded g (2)(0) on the order of 10-3, demonstrating the SiC platform as a prospective fully integrated, complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor compatible single-photon source for quantum applications.
   Illustration of entangled photon pair generation in an integrated silicon carbide (SiC) platform. This achievement, coupled with SiC's potential to integrate various electrical, photonic and quantum technologies in the same device platform, offers promises for the scalable implementation of quantum information processing.

TI Simple and practical DIQKD security analysis via BB84-type uncertainty
   relations and Pauli correlation constraints
SO QUANTUM
AB According to the entropy accumulation the-orem, proving the unconditional security of a device-independent quantum key distribution protocol reduces to deriving tradeoff functions, i.e., bounds on the single-round von Neumann entropy of the raw key as a function of Bell lin-ear functionals, conditioned on an eavesdrop-per's quantum side information. In this work, we describe how the conditional entropy can be bounded in the 2-input/2-output setting, where the analysis can be reduced to qubit sys-tems, by combining entropy bounds for vari-ants of the well-known BB84 protocol with quantum constraints on qubit operators on the bipartite system shared by Alice and Bob. The approach gives analytic bounds on the entropy, or semi-analytic ones in reasonable computa-tion time, which are typically close to opti-mal. We illustrate the approach on a variant of the device-independent CHSH QKD protocol where both bases are used to generate the key as well as on a more refined analysis of the orig-inal single-basis variant with respect to losses. We obtain in particular a detection efficiency threshold slightly below 80.26%.

TI Source of Heralded Atom-Photon Entanglement for Quantum Networking
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB Communication in quantum networks suffers notoriously from photon loss. Resulting errors can be mitigated with a suitable measurement herald at the receiving node. However, waiting for a herald and communicating the measurement result back to the sender in a repeat-until-success strategy makes the protocol slow and prone to errors from false heralds such as detector dark counts. Here, we implement an entanglement herald at the sending node by employing a cascaded two-photon emission of a single atom into two optical fiber cavities: the polarization of one photon is entangled with the spin of the atom, and the second photon heralds entanglement generation. We show that heralding improves the atom-photon entanglement in-fiber efficiency and fidelity to 68(3)% and 87(2)%, respectively. We highlight the potential of our source for noise-limited long-distance quantum communication by extending the range for constant fidelity or, alternatively, increasing the fidelity for a given distance.

TI Giant atoms with time-dependent couplings
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB We study the decay dynamics of a two-level giant atom that is coupled to a waveguide with time-dependent coupling strengths. In the non-Markovian regime where the retardation effect cannot be ignored, we show that the dynamics of the atom depends on the atom-waveguide coupling strengths at an earlier time. This allows one to tailor the decay dynamics of the giant atom and even realize a stationary population revival with appropriate coupling modulations. Moreover, we demonstrate the possibility of simulating the quantum Zeno and quantum anti-Zeno effects in the giant-atom model with periodic coupling quenches. These results have potential applications in quantum information processing and quantum network engineering.

This extends previous work on using isomorphism problems for signature schemes, a trend that has recently emerged in post-quantum cryptography. Our new formulation leverages a more general problem and allows for smaller data sizes, achieving competitive performance and great flexibility. Using MCE, we construct a zero-knowledge protocol which we turn into a signature scheme named Matrix Equivalence Digital Signature (MEDS). We provide an initial choice of parameters for MEDS, tailored to NIST's Category 1 security level, yielding public keys as small as 2.8 kB and signatures ranging from 18 kB to just around 6.5 kB, along with a reference implementation in C.

TI Coopetition in quantum prisoner's dilemma and COVID-19
SO QUANTUM INFORMATION PROCESSING
AB Decision-making is important especially during a crisis such as the novel COVID-19 pandemic. The quantum prisoner's dilemma with two dilemma strength parameters is introduced as a model for the interaction between pharmaceutical and other related enterprises during the pandemic. Novel Nash equilibria are identified. The coopetition equilibrium (simultaneous cooperation and competition) is emphasized. Motivated by the novel equilibria of the quantum version, a classical mixed-strategy formulation that can be applied to real-world situations is proposed. Suitable values of the dilemma strength parameters and quantum entanglement can encourage coopetition, which can be considered as a route to full cooperation.

TI Many-excitation removal of a transmon qubit using a single-junction
   quantum-circuit refrigerator and a two-tone microwave drive
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB Achieving fast and precise initialization of qubits is a critical requirement for the successful operation of quantum computers. The combination of engineered environments with all-microwave techniques has recently emerged as a promising approach for the reset of superconducting quantum devices. In this work, we experimentally demonstrate the utilization of a single-junction quantum-circuit refrigerator (QCR) for an expeditious removal of several excitations from a transmon qubit. The QCR is indirectly coupled to the transmon through a resonator in the dispersive regime, constituting a carefully engineered environmental spectrum for the transmon. Using single-shot readout, we observe excitation stabilization times down to roughly 500 ns, a 20-fold speedup with QCR and a simultaneous two-tone drive addressing the e-f and f0-g1 transitions of the system. Our results are obtained at a 48-mK fridge temperature and without postselection, fully capturing the advantage of the protocol for the short-time dynamics and the drive-induced detrimental asymptotic behavior in the presence of relatively hot other baths of the transmon. We validate our results with a detailed Liouvillian model truncated up to the three-excitation subspace, from which we estimate the performance of the protocol in optimized scenarios, such as cold transmon baths and fine-tuned driving frequencies. These results pave the way for optimized reset of quantum-electric devices using engineered environments and for dissipation-engineered state preparation.

TI Quantum coherence from Kirkwood-Dirac nonclassicality, some bounds, and
   operational interpretation
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICS A-MATHEMATICAL AND THEORETICAL
AB Just a few years after the inception of quantum mechanics, there has been a research program using the nonclassical values of some quasiprobability distributions to delineate the nonclassical aspects of quantum phenomena. In particular, in Kirkwood-Dirac (KD) quasiprobability distribution, the distinctive quantum mechanical feature of noncommutativity which underlies many nonclassical phenomena, manifests in the nonreal values and/or the negative values of the real part. Here, we develop a faithful quantifier of quantum coherence based on the KD nonclassicality which captures simultaneously the nonreality and the negativity of the KD quasiprobability. The KD-nonclassicality coherence thus defined, is upper bounded by the uncertainty of the outcomes of measurement described by a rank-1 orthogonal projection-valued measure (PVM) corresponding to the incoherent orthonormal basis which is quantified by the Tsallis 1 2 -entropy. Moreover, they are identical for pure states so that the KD-nonclassicality coherence for pure state admits a simple closed expression in terms of measurement probabilities. We then use the Maassen-Uffink uncertainty relation for min-entropy and max-entropy to obtain a lower bound for the KD-nonclassicality coherence of a pure state in terms of optimal guessing probability in measurement described by a PVM noncommuting with the incoherent orthonormal basis. We also derive a trade-off relation for the KD-nonclassicality coherences of a pure state relative to a pair of noncommuting orthonormal bases with a state-independent lower bound. Finally, we sketch a variational scheme for a direct estimation of the KD-nonclassicality coherence based on weak value measurement and thereby discuss its relation with quantum contextuality.

TI Robust entanglement and steering in open Dicke models with individual
   atomic spontaneous emission and dephasing
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB In this paper, we study steady-state quantum entanglement and steering in an open Dicke model where cavity dissipation and individual atomic decoherence are taken into account. Specifically, we consider that each atom is coupled to independent dephasing and squeezed environments, which makes the widely-adopted Holstein-Primakoff approximation invalid. By discovering the features of quantum phase transition in the presence of the decohering environments, we mainly find that (i) in both normal and superradiant phases, the cavity dissipation and individual atomic decoherence can improve the entanglement and steering between the cavity field and atomic ensemble; (ii) the individual atomic spontaneous emission leads to the appearance of the steering between the cavity field and atomic ensemble but the steering in two directions cannot be simultaneously generated; (iii) the maximal achievable steering in normal phase is stronger than that in superradiant phase; (iv) the entanglement and steering between the cavity output field and the atomic ensemble are much stronger than that with the intracavity, and the steerings in two directions can be achieved even with the same parameters. Our findings reveal unique features of quantum correlations in the open Dicke model in the presence of individual atomic decoherence processes. & COPY; 2023 Optica Publishing Group under the terms of the Optica Open Access Publishing Agreement

We show that, by suitable domain engineering with two periods of quasi-phase matching grating, it is possible to achieve a frequency entangled state with two different pairs of frequencies. Numerical simulations show that the output state can be maximally entangled. We also perform numerical simulations to address other interesting and useful entangled states which can be generated with the help of our scheme. The proposed scheme can help create efficient photonic setups required for quantum communication systems and can have various applications considering the increasing interests of energy-time entanglement in quantum information regime.

TI Unveiling the electronic structure of GaSb/AlGaSb quantum dots emitting
   in the third telecom window
SO MATERIALS FOR QUANTUM TECHNOLOGY
AB Epitaxially-grown semiconductor quantum dots (QDs) provide an attractive platform for the development of deterministic sources of high-quality quantum states of light. Such non-classical light sources are essential for quantum information processing and quantum communication. QDs emitting in the telecom wavelengths are especially important for ensuring compatibility with optical fiber systems required to implement quantum communication networks. To this end, GaSb QDs fabricated by filling local-droplet etched nanoholes are emerging as a viable approach, yet the electronic properties of such nanostructures have not been studied in detail. In this article, an insight into the electronic structure and carrier dynamics in GaSb/AlGaSb QDs is provided through a systematic experimental analysis of their temperature-dependent photoluminescence behavior. A steady-state rate equation model is used to reveal the relevant energy barriers for thermally activated carrier capture and escape processes. Furthermore, results of detailed theoretical simulations of quantum-confined energy states using the multi-band k center dot p model and the effective mass method are presented. The purpose of the simulations is to reveal the direct and indirect energy states, carrier wavefunctions, and allowed optical transitions for GaSb QDs with different physical dimensions.

TI Parameter-efficient quantum anomaly detection method on a
   superconducting quantum processor
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Quantum machine learning has gained attention for its potential to address computational challenges. However, whether those algorithms can effectively solve practical problems and outperform their classical counterparts, especially on current quantum hardware, remains a critical question. In this work, we propose a quantum machine learning method, called Parameter-Efficient Quantum Anomaly Detection (PEQAD), for practical image anomaly detection, which aims to achieve both parameter efficiency and superior accuracy compared to classical models. Emulation results indicate that PEQAD demonstrates favorable recognition capabilities compared to classical baselines, achieving an average accuracy of over 90% on benchmarks with significantly fewer trainable parameters. Theoretical analysis suggests that PEQAD has a comparable expressivity to classical counterparts while requiring only a fraction of the parameters. Furthermore, we demonstrate the first implementation of a quantum anomaly detection method for general image datasets on a superconducting quantum processor. Specifically, we achieve an accuracy of over 80% with only 16 parameters on the device, providing initial evidence of PEQAD's practical viability and highlighting its significant reduction in parameter requirements.

TI Quantum Hoare Logic with Classical Variables
SO ACM TRANSACTIONS ON QUANTUM COMPUTING
AB Hoare logic provides a syntax-oriented method to reason about program correctness and has been proven effective in the verification of classical and probabilistic programs. Existing proposals for quantumHoare logic either lack completeness or support only quantum variables, thus limiting their capability in practical use. In this article, we propose a quantum Hoare logic for a simple while language that involves both classical and quantum variables. Its soundness and relative completeness are proven for both partial and total correctness of quantum programs written in the language. Remarkably, with novel definitions of classical-quantum states and corresponding assertions, the logic system is quite simple and similar to the traditional Hoare logic for classical programs. Furthermore, to simplify reasoning in real applications, auxiliary proof rules are provided that support standard logical operation in the classical part of assertions and super-operator application in the quantum part. Finally, a series of practical quantum algorithms, in particular the whole algorithm of Shor's factorisation, are formally verified to show the effectiveness of the logic.

TI Metaheuristic optimization scheme for quantum kernel classifiers using
   entanglement-directed graphs
SO ETRI JOURNAL
AB Entanglement is crucial for achieving quantum advantages. However, in the context of quantum machine learning, existing optimization strategies for generating quantum classifier circuits often result in unentangled circuits, indicating an underutilization of the entanglement effect needed to learn complex patterns. In this study, we proposed a novel metaheuristic approach-genetic algorithm-for designing a quantum kernel classifier that incorporates expressive entanglement. This classifier utilizes a loopless entanglement-directed graph, where each directed edge represents the entanglement between the target and control qubits. The proposed method consistently outperforms classical and quantum baselines across various artificial and actual datasets, achieving improvements up to 32.4% and 17.5%, respectively, compared with the best model among all other baselines. Moreover, this method successfully reconstructs the hidden entanglement structures underlying artificial datasets. The results also demonstrate that the optimized circuits exhibit diverse entanglement variations across different datasets, indicating the versatility of the proposed approach.

TI Single electron quantum dot in two-dimensional transition metal
   dichalcogenides
SO NANOTECHNOLOGY
AB Spin-valley properties in two-dimensional (2D) semiconducting transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs) has attracted significant interest due to the possible applications in quantum computing. Spin-valley properties can be exploited in TMDC quantum dot (QD) with well-resolved energy levels. This requires smaller QDs, especially in material systems with heavy carrier effective mass e.g. TMDCs and silicon. Device architectures employed for TMDC QDs so far have difficulty achieving smaller QDs. Therefore, an alternative approach in the device architecture is needed. Here, we propose a multilayer device architecture to achieve a gate-defined QD in TMDC with a relatively large energy splitting on the QD. We provide a range of device dimensions and dielectric thicknesses and its correlation with the QD energy splitting. The device architecture is modeled realistically. Moreover, we show that all the device parameters used in modeling are experimentally achievable. These studies lay the foundation for future work toward spin-valley qubits in TMDCs. The successful implementation of these device architectures will drive the technological development of 2D materials-based quantum technologies.

TI Theoretical guarantees for permutation-equivariant quantum neural
   networks
SO NPJ QUANTUM INFORMATION
AB Despite the great promise of quantum machine learning models, there are several challenges one must overcome before unlocking their full potential. For instance, models based on quantum neural networks (QNNs) can suffer from excessive local minima and barren plateaus in their training landscapes. Recently, the nascent field of geometric quantum machine learning (GQML) has emerged as a potential solution to some of those issues. The key insight of GQML is that one should design architectures, such as equivariant QNNs, encoding the symmetries of the problem at hand. Here, we focus on problems with permutation symmetry (i.e., symmetry group Sn), and show how to build Sn-equivariant QNNs We provide an analytical study of their performance, proving that they do not suffer from barren plateaus, quickly reach overparametrization, and generalize well from small amounts of data. To verify our results, we perform numerical simulations for a graph state classification task. Our work provides theoretical guarantees for equivariant QNNs, thus indicating the power and potential of GQML.

SO DOKLADY NATSIONALNOI AKADEMII NAUK BELARUSI
AB The flavivirus polymerase protein undergoes structural changes during the polymerization reaction. The protein contains two zinc atoms, each of which is coordinated by four amino acids of the protein. The possibility of a quantum transition in zinc atoms is considered. It is shown that due to quantum entanglement this transition occurs jointly in both atoms. Using molecular dynamics modeling, it is shown that small perturbations of the structure associated with the joint transition of zinc atoms lead to structural changes in the polymerase. The prevalence of this phenomenon on other zinc- containing proteins is discussed.

TI Schmidt number criterion via general symmetric informationally complete

SO QUANTUM INFORMATION PROCESSING
AB The Schmidt number characterizes the quantum entanglement of a bipartite mixed state and plays a significant role in certifying entanglement of quantum states. We derive a Schmidt number criterion based on the trace norm of the correlation matrix obtained from the general symmetric informationally complete measurements. The criterion gives an effective way to quantify the entanglement dimension of a bipartite state with arbitrary local dimensions. We show that this Schmidt number criterion is more effective and superior than other criteria such as fidelity, CCNR (computable cross-norm or realignment), MUB (mutually unbiased bases) and EAM (equiangular measurements) criteria in certifying the Schmidt numbers by detailed examples.

Such a shift of perspective requires a general conceptual framework for understanding complexity in life sciences which is currently elusive, a transition being facilitated by large-scale data collection, unprecedented computational power, and new analytical tools.

Our results, along with other studies, serve as a proof of concept that Quantum Machine Learning (QML) methods can have similar or better performance, in specific cases of low number of training samples, with respect to conventional ML methods even with a limited number of qubits available in current hardware. To utilise algorithms with a low number of qubits - to accommodate for limitations in both simulation hardware and real quantum hardware - we investigated different feature reduction methods. Their impact on the performance of both the classical and quantum models was assessed. We addressed different implementations of two QML models, representative of the two main approaches to supervised quantum machine learning today: a Quantum Support Vector Machine (QSVM), a kernel-based method, and a Variational Quantum Circuit (VQC), a variational approach.

TI Coherent Quantum Emitters in Hexagonal Boron Nitride
SO ADVANCED QUANTUM TECHNOLOGIES
AB Hexagonal boron nitride is an emerging 2D material with far-reaching applications in fields like nanophotonics or nanomechanics. Its layered architecture plays a key role for new materials such as Van der Waals heterostructures. The layered structure has also unique implications for hosted, optically active defect centers. A very special type of defect center arises from the possibility to host mechanically isolated orbitals localized between the layers. The resulting absence of coupling to low-frequency acoustic phonons turns out to be the essential element to protect the coherence of optical transitions from mechanical interactions with the environment. Consequently, the spectral transition linewidth remains unusually narrow even at room temperature, thus paving a new way toward coherent quantum optics under ambient conditions. In this review, the state-of-the-art of defect centers in hexagonal boron nitride is summarized with a focus on optically coherent defect centers. The current understanding of the defect centers, remaining questions, and potential research directions to overcome pervasive challenges are discussed. The field is put into a broad perspective with impact on quantum technology such as quantum optics, quantum photonics, as well as spin optomechanics.

TI Bridging the quantum divides: a chance to repair classic(al) mistakes?
SO QUANTUM SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB Classical computing, which has transformed the world in unprecedented ways, has not always been deployed in ways that prioritise ethical values such as fairness, justice, and equity. The Western-focused, Silicon-Valley-centric 21st-century-computing model creates digital 'haves' and 'have-nots'. Quantum computers promise to be exponentially more powerful than classical computers for some classically hard problems, potentially transforming application areas such as chemistry, drug discovery, and machine learning. However, if access and control over quantum computing is not shared equitably, then this may serve to amplify existing inequalities and create even deeper divides. Here we consider some of the possible implications for responsible quantum computing, looking ahead to ways in which the rollout of quantum computing could centre ethical principles such as fairness and equity, in order to prevent the mistakes of the 'classical-only' past. The issues raised in this paper will be of interest to those engaged in quantum computing research and to those concerned with the societal implications of this major new technology.

AB Motivated by the growing interest in accessing the spin structure of multi-boson processes and in measuring quantum entanglement at high energies, we study polarisation and spin-correlation coefficients in di-boson systems. We show that higher-order corrections of QCD and electroweak type, off-shell modeling, and realistic effects such as fiducial selections and neutrino reconstruction are unavoidable to properly determine such coefficients, and consequently to provide a sound interpretation of observables sensitive to quantum entanglement and Bell-inequality violation. Our findings are based on a detailed phenomenological analysis of boson pairs at the LHC, either in inclusive electroweak production or coming from Higgs-boson decays.

We provide a game-based learning approach based on Tic-Tac-Toe in a quantum modified version as a result of our study. We created a prototype to demonstrate and evaluate our assumptions using the design science research technique. Qualitative user feedback provided us with vital insights and shown that this game-based method helps to cope with quantum physics in a fun way. A majority of those who took part in the study stated that their interest in the subject had increased. However, for novices, it is necessary to follow them during the initial period of their training. The comments were quite helpful in optimizing the prototype. We found that our strategy, which included the use of a virtual opponent as well as the presentation of extra information about the quantum circuit, was more effective in helping participants comprehend quantum physics than earlier Tic-Tac-Toe-based learning settings.

SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB Variational quantum algorithms offer a promising new paradigm for solving partial differential equations on near-term quantum computers. Here, we propose a variational quantum algorithm for solving a general evolution equation through implicit time-stepping of the Laplacian operator. The use of encoded source states informed by preceding solution vectors results in faster convergence compared to random re-initialization. Through statevector simulations of the heat equation, we demonstrate how the time complexity of our algorithm scales with the Ansatz volume for gradient estimation and how the time-to-solution scales with the diffusion parameter. Our proposed algorithm extends economically to higher-order time-stepping schemes, such as the Crank-Nicolson method. We present a semi-implicit scheme for solving systems of evolution equations with non-linear terms, such as the reaction-diffusion and the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations, and demonstrate its validity by proof-of-concept results.

TI A Quantum-Enhanced Precision Medicine Application to Support Data-Driven
   Clinical Decisions for the Personalized Treatment of Advanced Knee
   Osteoarthritis: The Development and Preliminary Validation of
   precisionKNEE_QNN
SO CUREUS JOURNAL OF MEDICAL SCIENCE
AB Background Quantum computing and quantum machine learning (QML) are promising experimental technologies that can improve precision medicine applications by reducing the computational complexity of algorithms driven by big, unstructured, real-world data. The clinical problem of knee osteoarthritis is that, although some novel therapies are safe and effective, the response is variable, and defining the characteristics of an individual who will respond remains a challenge. In this study, we tested a quantum neural network (QNN) application to support precision data-driven clinical decisions to select personalized treatments for advanced knee osteoarthritis. Methodology After obtaining patients' consent and Research Ethics Committee approval, we collected the clinicodemographic data before and after the treatment from 170 patients eligible for knee arthroplasty (Kellgren-Lawrence grade >3, Oxford Knee Score (OKS) <= 27, age >64 years, and idiopathic aetiology of arthritis) treated over a two-year period with a single injection of microfragmented fat. Gender classes were balanced (76 males and 94 females) to mitigate gender bias. A patient with an improvement >7 OKS was considered a responder. We trained our QNN classifier on a randomly selected training subset of 113 patients to classify responders from non-responders (73 responders and 40 non-responders) in pain and function at one year. Outliers were hidden from the training dataset but not from the validation set. Results We tested our QNN classifier on a randomly selected test subset of 57 patients (34 responders, 23 non -responders) including outliers. The no information rate was 0.59. Our application correctly classified 28 responders out of 34 and 6 non-responders out of 23 (sensitivity = 0.82, specificity = 0.26, F1 Statistic = 0.71). The positive and negative likelihood ratios were 1.11 and 0.68, respectively. The diagnostic odds ratio was 2. Conclusions Preliminary results on a small validation dataset showed that QML applied to data-driven clinical decisions for the personalized treatment of advanced knee osteoarthritis is a promising technology to reduce computational complexity and improve prognostic performance. Our results need further research validation with larger, real-world unstructured datasets, as well as clinical validation with an artificial intelligence clinical trial to test model efficacy, safety, clinical significance, and relevance at a public health level.

TI QUANTUM STATISTICAL PERSPECTIVE TO EXAMINE THE SOURCE CHAOS FRACTION

SO FRACTALS-COMPLEX GEOMETRY PATTERNS AND SCALING IN NATURE AND SOCIETY
AB Bose-Einstein correlations of identical particles reveal the shape and size of the particle emitting source of the given boson. These correlations are pivotal for a better understanding of the source dynamics and developing techniques to examine the propagation of quantum chaos in the presence of coherence at a certain temperature and momentum. Femtoscopy is of the utmost importance during this transformation for data processing and coherence-chaos analysis discrepancies. We introduced an evolving source to describe chaotic information inside quantum entanglement and the impact of the coherence order is discussed in this research. We also investigate the role of source size parameter and particle number in the dynamics of the temperature profiles with the function of momentum variation. The influences of the modeling factors on the correlations with their normalized correlator in the perspective of source coherence have been evaluated and the orientation of the source has an effect on the diffusivity of the fluid under consideration. Such consequences can cause an increase or decrease the genuine correlations due to the distributions of velocity and temperature. The main findings of the paper have been illustrated using the graphical representations of the considered correlations according to the geometry of the expanding source. Such results reveal the lucrativeness in the field of engineering applications.

TI Entanglement-Assisted Quantum Codes from Cyclic Codes
SO ENTROPY
AB Entanglement-assisted quantum-error-correcting (EAQEC) codes are quantum codes which use entanglement as a resource. These codes can provide better error correction than the (entanglement unassisted) codes derived from the traditional stabilizer formalism. In this paper, we provide a general method to construct EAQEC codes from cyclic codes. Afterwards, the method is applied to Reed-Solomon codes, BCH codes, and general cyclic codes. We use the Euclidean and Hermitian construction of EAQEC codes. Three families have been created: two families of EAQEC codes are maximal distance separable (MDS), and one is almost MDS or almost near MDS. The comparison of the codes in this paper is mostly based on the quantum Singleton bound.

TI Randomness-based macroscopic Franson-type nonlocal correlation
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB Franson-type nonlocal correlation is related to Bell inequality violation tests and has been applied for quantum key distributions based on time bin methods. Using unbalanced Mach-Zehnder interferometers, Franson correlation measurements result in an interference fringe, while local measurements do not. Here, randomness-based macroscopic Franson-type correlation is presented using polarization-based two-mode coherent photons, where the quantum correlation is tested by a Hong-Ou-Mandel scheme. Coherent photons are used to investigate the wave properties of this correlation. Without contradicting the wave-particle duality of quantum mechanics, the proposed method provides fundamental understanding of the quantum nature and opens the door to deterministic quantum information science.

TI Squashed entanglement from generalized Rindler wedge
SO JOURNAL OF HIGH ENERGY PHYSICS
AB We investigate the bipartite and multipartite quantum entanglement structure of gravitational subsystems and in the dual holographic field theory based on the generalized Rindler wedge formalism. We deduce a separation theorem, which asserts that for subregions satisfying a certain geometric condition, the bipartite/multipartite squashed entanglement or the conditional entanglement of multipartite information vanishes, indicating that these sub-regions represent separable states with no quantum entanglement among them. We interpret this fact from the observer perspective in gravity and show how to probe the entanglement structure further in this framework by introducing a time cutoff in the gravitational spacetime. We also present the corresponding dual boundary field theory interpretation.

TI The impact of light polarization and the nature of modes in the
   formation of quasi-bound states in the continuum at near-normal
   incidence
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICS D-APPLIED PHYSICS
AB Bound states in the continuum (BIC) is a peculiar resonant mode with an infinite radiative lifetime and quality factor (Q-factor) embedded within the radiation continuum, which find applications in sensing, lasing, and quantum photonics. While an ideal BIC with an infinite Q-factor can only occur in theory, observing quasi-BIC in realistic samples with finite sizes is possible. However, the robustness of quasi-BIC depends primarily on the trapped electromagnetic modes. Here, we discuss the polarization dependence and the nature of quasi-BIC mode in a two-dimensional array of gallium arsenide (GaAs) scatterers through finite difference time domain simulations and analytical calculations. The calculated angle- and polarization-dependent transmission spectra show quasi-BIC evolution with high Q-factor at near-normal incidence only for transverse magnetic polarization. The calculated total scattering cross-section implies the dominant contribution from electric dipole moments in generating the quasi-BIC. The evolution of quasi-BIC mode is discussed in terms of Mie or Fabry-Perot modes using geometry-dependent transmission and field intensity calculations. The proposed GaAs metasurfaces with quasi-BIC at 638 nm, corresponding to the zero phonon line of nitrogen-vacancy centers in diamond are useful for applications in photonic quantum technologies.

This article presents an optimized Very High Speed Integrated Circuit Hardware Description Language (VHDL)-based implementation of the main components of the Kyber scheme, namely Number-Theoretic Transform (NTT) and Keccak. We focus specifically on NTT, Keccak and their derivatives since they largely determine Kyber's performance due to their wide involvement in each step of the scheme. Our high-speed implementation also takes into account the trade-off between the degree of parallelization and the resources utilization. The NTT component is more than 27% faster than the state-of-the-art implementations. Furthermore, the optimization helps the algorithm to achieve 1 572 839 NTT operations per second.

TI Bolometric detection of Josephson radiation
SO NATURE NANOTECHNOLOGY
AB One of the most promising approaches towards large-scale quantum computation uses devices based on many Josephson junctions. Yet, even today, open questions regarding the single junction remain unsolved, such as the detailed understanding of the quantum phase transitions, the coupling of the Josephson junction to the environment or how to improve the coherence of a superconducting qubit. Here we design and build an engineered on-chip reservoir connected to a Josephson junction that acts as an efficient bolometer for detecting the Josephson radiation under non-equilibrium, that is, biased conditions. The bolometer converts the a.c. Josephson current at microwave frequencies up to about 100 GHz into a temperature rise measured by d.c. thermometry. A circuit model based on realistic parameter values captures both the current-voltage characteristics and the measured power quantitatively. The present experiment demonstrates an efficient, wide-band, thermal detection scheme of microwave photons and provides a sensitive detector of Josephson dynamics beyond the standard conductance measurements.

TI Logistic Map Image Cryptography Scheme Based on Chaotic Quantum Boson
   Sampling
SO ADVANCED QUANTUM TECHNOLOGIES
AB Images are crucial for digital signal transmission and face significant security challenges due to the growing sophistication of cyber threats. Although classical cryptography based on logistic map is commonly used for image encryption, it is often susceptible to periodic and predictable behaviors arising from specific initial conditions and parameter settings. The predictability poses a risk to the security of encryption system. In response to the challenges, this paper presents a novel image cryptography scheme, as the logistic map image cryptography scheme based on chaotic quantum Boson sampling (LM-BS), which combines the encryption strength of the logistic map with the inherent unpredictability of chaotic quantum Boson sampling(QBS). LM-BS scheme takes advantage of the distinctive properties of random interference among bosons in quantum systems, significantly enhancing the sensitivity, randomness, and unpredictability of encryption keys, which effectively addresses the periodicity and predictability challenges associated with traditional chaotic systems. Moreover, the image encryption experiments are put on the silicon photonic chips and the StrawberryFields photonic platform by using LM-BS scheme on various grey-scale images. The experimental results indicate that the LM-BS enables reliable image encryption and decryption, reduces the risk of key leakage, and successfully ensures the security and privacy of image transmission. Overall, the LM-BS scheme lays a strong theoretical foundation for future encryption based on quantum computation and demonstrates the considerable potential for a wide range of applications.

TI Dynamic circuit for the honeycomb Floquet code
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB In the typical implementation of a quantum error-correcting code, each stabilizer is measured by entangling one or more ancilla qubits with the data qubits and measuring the ancilla qubits to deduce the value of the stabilizer. Recently, the dynamic circuit approach has been introduced, in which stabilizers are measured without ancilla qubits. Here, we demonstrate that dynamic circuits are particularly useful for the Floquet code. Our dynamic circuit increases the timelike distance of the code, automatically removes leakage, and both significantly increases the threshold and lowers the logical error rate compared to the standard ancilla-based circuit. At a physical error rate of 10-3, we estimate a nearly 3x reduction in the number of qubits required to reach a 10-12 logical error rate.

AB Bell non-locality is a fundamental feature of quantum mechanics whereby measurements performed on "spatially separated" quantum systems can exhibit correlations that cannot be understood as revealing predetermined values. This is a special case of the more general phenomenon of "quantum contextuality", which says that such correlations can occur even when the measurements are not necessarily on separate quantum systems, but are merely "compatible" (i.e. commuting). Crucially, while any non-local game yields an experiment that demonstrates quantum advantage by leveraging the "spatial separation" of two or more devices (and in fact several such demonstrations have been conducted successfully in recent years), the same is not true for quantum contextuality: finding the contextuality analogue of such an experiment is arguably one of the central open questions in the foundations of quantum mechanics.
   In this work, we show that an arbitrary contextuality game can be compiled into an "operational test of contextuality" involving a single quantum device, by only making the assumption that the device is computationally bounded. Our work is inspired by the recent work of Kalai et al. (STOC '23) that converts any non-local game into a classical test of quantum advantage with a single device. The central idea in their work is to use cryptography to enforce spatial separation within subsystems of a single quantum device. Our work can be seen as using cryptography to enforce "temporal separation", i.e. to restrict communication between sequential measurements.
   Beyond contextuality, we employ our ideas to design a "proof of quantumness" that, to the best of our knowledge, is arguably even simpler than the ones proposed in the literature so far.

TI Application of Pontryagin's maximum principle to quantum metrology in
   dissipative systems
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Optimal control theory, also known as Pontryagin???s maximum principle, is applied to the quantum parameter estimation in the presence of decoherence. An efficient procedure is devised to compute the gradient of quantum Fisher information with respect to the control parameters and is used to construct the optimal control protocol. The proposed procedure keeps the control problem in the time-invariant form so that both first-order and second order optimality conditions derived from Pontryagin???s maximum principle apply; the second-order condition turns out to be crucial when the optimal control contains singular arcs. Concretely we look for the optimal control that maximizes quantum Fisher information for the ???twist and turn??? problem. We find that the optimal control is singular without dissipation but can become unbounded once the quantum decoherence is introduced. An amplitude constraint is needed to guarantee a bounded solution. With quantum decoherence, the maximum quantum Fisher information happens at a finite time due to the decoherence, and the asymptotic value depends on the specific decoherence channel and the control of consideration.

TI A New Nano-Scale and Energy-Optimized Reversible Digital Circuit Based
   on Quantum Technology
SO ELECTRONICS
AB A nano-scale quantum-dot cellular automaton (QCA) is one of the most promising replacements for CMOS technology. Despite the potential advantages of this technology, QCA circuits are frequently plagued by numerous forms of manufacturing faults (such as a missing cell, extra cell, displacement cell, and rotated cell), making them prone to failure. As a result, in QCA technology, the design of reversible circuits has received much attention. Reversible circuits are resistant to many kinds of faults due to their inherent properties and have the possibility of data reversibility, which is important. Therefore, this research proposes a new reversible gate, followed by a new 3 x 3 reversible gate. The proposed structure does not need rotated cells and only uses one layer, increasing the design's manufacturability. QCADesigner-E and the Euler method on coherence vector (w/energy) are employed to simulate the proposed structure. The 3 x 3 reversible circuit consists of 21 cells that take up just 0.046 mu m(2). Compared to the existing QCA-based single-layer reversible circuit, the proposed reversible circuit minimizes cell count, area, and delay. Furthermore, the energy consumption is studied, confirming the optimal energy consumption pattern in the proposed circuit. The proposed reversible 3 x 3 circuit dissipates average energy of 1.36 (eV) and overall energy of 1.49 (eV). Finally, the quantum cost for implementing the reversible circuits indicates a lower value than that of all the other examined circuits.

AB The Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) is one of the most promising candidates for achieving quantum advantage over classical computers. However, existing compilers lack specialized methods for optimizing QAOA circuits. There are circuit patterns inside the QAOA circuits, and current quantum hardware has specific qubit connectivity topologies. Therefore, we propose Coqa to optimize QAOA circuit compilation tailored to different types of quantum hardware. Our method integrates a linear nearest-neighbor (LNN) topology and efficiently map the patterns of QAOA circuits to the LNN topology by heuristically checking the interaction based on the weight of problem Hamiltonian. This approach allows us to reduce the number of SWAP gates during compilation, which directly impacts the circuit depth and overall fidelity of the quantum computation. By leveraging the inherent patterns in QAOA circuits, our approach achieves more efficient compilation compared to general-purpose compilers. With our proposed method, we are able to achieve an average of 30% reduction in gate count and a 39x acceleration in compilation time across our benchmarks.

TI Sensitivity of entanglement measures in bipartite pure quantum states
SO MODERN PHYSICS LETTERS B
AB Entanglement measures quantify the amount of quantum entanglement that is contained in quantum states. Typically, different entanglement measures do not have to be partially ordered. The presence of a definite partial order between two entanglement measures for all quantum states, however, allows for meaningful conceptualization of sensitivity to entanglement, which will be greater for the entanglement measure that produces the larger numerical values. Here, we have investigated the partial order between the normalized versions of four entanglement measures based on Schmidt decomposition of bipartite pure quantum states, namely, concurrence, tangle, entanglement robustness and Schmidt number. We have shown that among those four measures, the concurrence and the Schmidt number have the highest and the lowest sensitivity to quantum entanglement, respectively. Further, we have demonstrated how these measures could be used to track the dynamics of quantum entanglement in a simple quantum toy model composed of two qutrits. Lastly, we have employed state-dependent entanglement statistics to compute measurable correlations between the outcomes of quantum observables in agreement with the uncertainty principle. The presented results could be helpful in quantum applications that require monitoring of the available quantum resources for sharp identification of temporal points of maximal entanglement or system separability.

TI New results on vacuum fluctuations: Accelerated detector versus inertial
   detector in a quantum field

AB We investigate the interaction between a moving detector and a quantum field, especially about how the trajectory of the detector would affect the vacuum fluctuations when the detector moves in a quantum field (the Unruh effect). We focus on two moving detectors system for future application in quantum teleportation. We find that the trajectory of a uniformly accelerated detector in Rindler space cannot be extended to a trajectory in which a detector moves at constant velocity. Based on our previous work, we redo the calculations and find that a term is missing from past calculations, and we also find that there are some restrictions on the values for the parameters in the solutions. In addition, without inclusion of the missing term, the variance from the quantum field for the inertial detector will be zero and is unlikely in such a system. When all these points are combined, there is a difference in the two-point correlation function between the inertial detector and the accelerated detector in the early-time region. The influence of proper acceleration can be seen in the two-point correlation functions. This might play a role in the quantum teleportation process and be worth studying thoroughly.

TI Quantum K-Nearest Neighbors: Utilizing QRAM and SWAP-Test Techniques for
   Enhanced Performance
SO MATHEMATICS
AB This work introduces a quantum K-Nearest Neighbor (K-NN) classifier algorithm. The algorithm utilizes angle encoding through a Quantum Random Access Memory (QRAM) using n number of qubit addresses with O(log(n)) space complexity. It incorporates Grover's algorithm and the quantum SWAP-Test to identify similar states and determine the nearest neighbors with high probability, achieving Om search complexity, where m is the qubit address. We implement a simulation of the algorithm using IBM's Qiskit with GPU support, applying it to the Iris and MNIST datasets with two different angle encodings. The experiments employ multiple QRAM cell sizes (8, 16, 32, 64, 128) and perform ten trials per size. According to the performance, accuracy values in the Iris dataset range from 89.3 +/- 5.78% to 94.0 +/- 1.56%. The MNIST dataset's mean binary accuracy values range from 79.45 +/- 18.84% to 94.00 +/- 2.11% for classes 0 and 1. Additionally, a comparison of the results of this proposed approach with different state-of-the-art versions of QK-NN and the classical K-NN using Scikit-learn. This method achieves a 96.4 +/- 2.22% accuracy in the Iris dataset. Finally, this proposal contributes an experimental result to the state of the art for the MNIST dataset, achieving an accuracy of 96.55 +/- 2.00%. This work presents a new implementation proposal for QK-NN and conducts multiple experiments that yield more robust results than previous implementations. Although our average performance approaches still need to surpass the classic results, an experimental increase in the size of QRAM or the amount of data to encode is not achieved due to limitations. However, our results show promising improvement when considering working with more feature numbers and accommodating more data in the QRAM.

TI Novel scheme for secure data transmission based on mesoscopic twin beams
   and photon-number-resolving detectors
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB Quantum resources can improve the quality and security of data transmission. A novel communication protocol based on the use of mesoscopic twin-beam (TWB) states of light is proposed and discussed. The message sent by Alice to Bob is encoded in binary single-mode thermal states having two possible mean values, both smaller than the mean value of the TWB. Such thermal states are alternately superimposed to the portion of TWB sent to Bob. We demonstrate that in the presence of an eavesdropping attack that intercepts and substitutes part of the signal with a thermal noise, Bob can still successfully decrypt the message by evaluating the noise reduction factor for detected photons. The protocol opens new perspectives in the exploitation of quantum states of light for applications to Quantum Communication.

TI Quantum Diamonds at the Beach: Chemical Insights into Silica Growth on
   Nanoscale Diamond using Multimodal Characterization and Simulation
SO ACS NANOSCIENCE AU
AB Surface chemistry of materials that host quantum bits such as diamond is an important avenue of exploration as quantum computation and quantum sensing platforms mature. Interfacing diamond in general and nanoscale diamond (ND) in particular with silica is a potential route to integrate room temperature quantum bits into photonic devices, fiber optics, cells, or tissues with flexible functionalization chemistry. While silica growth on ND cores has been used successfully for quantum sensing and biolabeling, the surface mechanism to initiate growth was unknown. This report describes the surface chemistry responsible for silica bond formation on diamond and uses X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) to probe the diamond surface chemistry and its electronic structure with increasing silica thickness. A modified Sto''ber (Cigler) method was used to synthesize 2-35 nm thick shells of SiO2 onto carboxylic acid-rich ND cores. The diamond morphology, surface, and electronic structure were characterized by overlapping techniques including electron microscopy. Importantly, we discovered that SiO2 growth on carboxylated NDs eliminates the presence of carboxylic acids and that basic ethanolic solutions convert the ND surface to an alcohol-rich surface prior to silica growth. The data supports a mechanism that alcohols on the ND surface generate silyl-ether (ND-O-Si-(OH)3) bonds due to rehydroxylation by ammonium hydroxide in ethanol. The suppression of the diamond electronic structure as a function of SiO2 thickness was observed for the first time, and a maximum probing depth of & SIM;14 nm was calculated. XAS spectra based on the Auger electron escape depth was modeled using the NIST database for the Simulation of Electron Spectra for Surface Analysis (SESSA) to support our experimental results. Additionally, resonant inelastic X-ray scattering (RIXS) maps produced by the transition edge sensor reinforces the chemical analysis provided by XAS. Researchers using diamond or high-pressure high temperature (HPHT) NDs and other exotic materials (e.g., silicon carbide or cubic-boron nitride) for quantum sensing applications may exploit these results to design new layered or core-shell quantum sensors by forming covalent bonds via surface alcohol groups.

AB For an integer m >= 1, we study cyclic codes of length l over a commutative non-chain ring F-2n + uF(2n), where u(2) = u. With a new Gray map and Euclidean dual-containing cyclic codes, we provide many new and superior codes to the best-known quantum error-correcting codes. Also, we characterise LCD codes of length. with respect to their generator polynomials and prove that F-2n-image of an LCD code of length l is an LCD code of length 2l. Finally, we provide several optimal LCD codes from the Gray images of LCD codes over F-2n + uF(2n).

TI Neural networks can learn to utilize correlated auxiliary noise
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB We demonstrate that neural networks that process noisy data can learn to exploit, when available, access to auxiliary noise that is correlated with the noise on the data. In effect, the network learns to use the correlated auxiliary noise as an approximate key to decipher its noisy input data. An example of naturally occurring correlated auxiliary noise is the noise due to decoherence. Our results could, therefore, also be of interest, for example, for machine-learned quantum error correction.

TI Superquantization rule for multistability in driven-dissipative quantum
   systems
SO NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB We present a superquantization rule which indicates the possible robust stationary states of a generic driven-dissipative quantum system. Multistability in a driven cavity mode interacting with a qudit is revealed hence within a simple intuitive picture. The accuracy of the superquantization approach is confirmed by numerical simulations of the underlying quantum model. In the case when the qudit is composed of several two-level emitters coupled homogeneously to the cavity, we demonstrate the robustness of the superquantized steady states to single-emitter decay.

TI Inverse Design of Molecular Qudits for Quantum Circuitry
SO INORGANIC CHEMISTRY
AB The development of molecular quantum bits (qubits) for quantum information processing is a lofty goal. While many contemporary works investigate their potential for error correction, fault-tolerance, memories, etc., there is still a lack of experimental examples of molecular multiqubit sequences. Herein, we perform a theoretical investigation of spin Hamiltonian parameter space to identify molecules that could be used to implement a 4-level superdense coding algorithm that has the least stringent requirements for experimental implementation. To do so, we analyze the zero-field splitting (ZFS) Hamiltonian of an S = 3/2 spin system to determine its effectiveness as a molecular qudit capable of performing the superdense coding circuit with X-band pulsed electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR), accounting for realistic constraints imposed by EPR spectrometers. For an S = 3/2 system, the optimal ZFS parameters are |D| approximate to 0.115 cm-1 and |E| approximate to -0.0383 cm-1 (|E/D| approximate to 0.33 approaching the rhombic limit of 1/3), with a field around 160 mT. Our findings highlight the need to maximize the rhombicity of the spin Hamiltonian for four-level molecular qudits.

We also present a practical assessment of recently selected PQC algorithms by the National Institute of Standards and Technologies (NIST) PQC standardization on typical platforms that can be deployed in intelligent infrastructures (e. g., smartphones and single-boards), and recently recommended hash-based signatures for software/firmware signing. Finally, we discuss how incoming post-quantum migration affects selected areas in intelligent infrastructures.

TI Exploring the Limits of Controlled Markovian Quantum Dynamics with
   Thermal Resources
SO OPEN SYSTEMS & INFORMATION DYNAMICS
AB Our aim is twofold: First, we rigorously analyse the generators of quantum-dynamical semigroups of thermodynamic processes. We characterise a wide class of gksl-generators for quantum maps within thermal operations and argue that every infinitesimal generator of (a one-parameter semigroup of) Markovian thermal operations belongs to this class. We completely classify and visualise them and their non-Markovian counterparts for the case of a single qubit. Second, we use this description in the framework of bilinear control systems to characterise reachable sets of coherently controllable quantum systems with switchable coupling to a thermal bath. The core problem reduces to studying a hybrid control system ("toy model") on the standard simplex allowing for two types of evolution: (i) instantaneous permutations and (ii) a one-parameter semigroup of d-stochastic maps. We generalise upper bounds of the reachable set of this toy model invoking new results on thermomajorisation. Using tools of control theory we fully characterise these reachable sets as well as the set of stabilisable states as exemplified by exact results in qutrit systems.

TI Satellite dish-like nanocomposite as a breakthrough in single photon
   detection for highly developed optoelectronic applications
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB A nanocomposite with a unique satellite dish-like structure, termed arsenic (III) oxide iodide (AsO2I)/polypyrrole (Ppy) intercalated with iodide ions (AsO2I/Ppy-I), has been meticulously developed via a two-step process. It features natural satellite dish-like nanostructures, potentially serving as nanoresonators for efficient single photon absorption. With a bandgap of 2.8 eV, the AsO2I/Ppy-I nanocomposite efficiently absorbs photons in the UV and visible light regions, making it suitable for single photon detection. Impressive performance is seen in photocurrent sensitivity measurements, recording values of 0.017 mA.cm-2 under white light and 0.009 mA.cm-2 under monochromatic light at 340 nm. Additionally, it exhibits high responsivity and detectivity, with peak values at wavelengths of 340 nm and 440 nm associated with the diameter of the Satellite dish nanostructure. Cost-effectiveness and simple synthesis methods make it attractive for industrial applications, while its unique structural characteristics and enhanced optical properties position it as a valuable asset in optoelectronic technologies. It holds promise as a leading material in advanced quantum technology, marking a significant leap forward in optoelectronic technologies, with potential applications in quantum cryptography, communication, and computing.

TI A Haskell Adiabatic DSL: Solving Classical Optimization Problems on
   Quantum Hardware
SO PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACM ON PROGRAMMING LANGUAGES-PACMPL
AB In physics and chemistry, quantum systems are typically modeled using energy constraints formulated as Hamiltonians. Investigations into such systems often focus on the evolution of the Hamiltonians under various initial conditions, an approach summarized as Adiabatic Quantum Computing (AQC). Although this perspective may initially seem foreign to functional programmers, we demonstrate that conventional functional programming abstractions-specifically, the Traversable and Monad type classes-naturally capture the essence of AQC. To illustrate this connection, we introduce ENQ, a functional programming library designed to express diverse optimization problems as energy constraint computations (ECC). The library comprises three core components: generating the solution space, associating energy costs with potential solutions, and searching for optimal or near-optimal solutions. Because ENQ is implemented using standard Haskell, it can be executed directly through conventional classical Haskell compilers. More interestingly, we develop and implement a process to compile ENQ programs into circuits executable on quantum hardware. We validate ENQ 's effectiveness through a number of case studies, demonstrating its capacity to express and solve classical optimization problems on quantum hardware, including search problems, type inference, number partitioning, clique finding, and graph coloring.

TI Efficient preparation of two-dimensional defect-free atom arrays with
   near-fewest sorting-atom moves
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Sorting atoms stochastically loaded in optical tweezer arrays via an auxiliary mobile tweezer is an efficient approach to preparing intermediate-scale defect-free atom arrays in arbitrary geometries. However, the high filling fraction of atom-by-atom assemblers is impeded by redundant sorting moves with imperfect atom transport, especially for scaling the system size to larger atom numbers. Here we propose a sorting algorithm [the heuristic cluster algorithm (HCA)] which provides the near-fewest number of moves N-m approximate to N (N is the number of defect sites to be filled) and experimentally demonstrate a 5 x 6 defect-free atom array with 98.4(7)% filling fraction for one rearrangement cycle. Furthermore, we compare the HCA with two other algorithms by simulating results and find that the HCA is well suited for large-scale atom assemblers. Our method is essential to scale hundreds of assembled atoms for bottom-up quantum computation, quantum simulation, and precision measurement.

TI New Eco-Friendly Surfactant Corrosion Inhibitors Derived from

   Theoretical Quantum Computation, and Simulation Analysis
SO EGYPTIAN JOURNAL OF CHEMISTRY
AB Corrosion inhibitors are vital for infrastructure preservation from corrosion, cost savings, and environmental protection. Recognizing ecological consequences underscores the need for eco-friendly inhibitor development and proactive management to safeguard resources and ecosystems. In this study, Development of eco-friendly Gemini surfactants based on PEG derivatives, systematically varying PEG molecular weight, characterized by FTIR and 1H NMR, with detailed corrosion inhibition evaluation and computational studies. PEG derivative surfactants were synthesized from different molecular weights (400, 1000, 4000, 6000) of PEG via oxidation with chromic acid. The resulting PEG carboxylic acid intermediates were then amidated with N, N-Dimethylpropane-1,3-diamine and converted into cationic Gemini surfactant bromide compounds using 1-Bromooctane. In 1 N HCl, surface activity was measured at 25 degrees C, 40 degrees C, and 60 degrees C, showing that as temperature increases, surface tension decreases, and CMC values rise for all synthesized surfactants. PE-Br-6000 exhibited higher corrosion inhibition efficacy (%eta w) at 400 ppm (95.5%, 97.5%, 98.0%) compared to PE-Br-4000 (92.6%, 94.9%, 95.1%), PE-Br-1000 (90.0%, 92.0%, 93.2%), and PE-Br-400 (87.4%, 87.6%, 90.8%) at 25 degrees C, 55 degrees C, and 70 degrees C. Potentiodynamic polarization showed PE-Br-6000's efficacy at 25 degrees C was 89.3%, surpassing PE-Br-4000 (85.9%), PE-Br-1000 (85.2%), and PE-Br-400 (84.8%). Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy indicated PE-Br-6000's 95.6% efficacy at 25 degrees C, outperforming PE-Br-4000 (95.3%), PE-Br-1000 (95.2%), and PE-Br-400 (95.0%). Quantum computational studies used Gaussian 09W (RHF theory, Sto-3G basis sets) and Monte Carlo (MC) Simulation with Biovia Material Studio software (2020). Further PEG derivative research involves exploring wider molecular weight ranges and structural modifications. Enhanced synthesis, extended corrosion testing, computational modeling, and environmental assessments aim to optimize eco-friendly corrosion inhibitors for improved infrastructure protection.

Lett. 133, 033601 (2024)], the coherence time of degenerate entangled photon pairs (biphotons) generated via backward spontaneous four-wave mixing in a cold atomic ensemble was shown to be immune to optical loss and dephasing. This finding is crucial for practical applications in quantum information processing, quantum communication, and networking, where loss is inevitable. However, in studying the underlying mechanism for this loss- and dephasing-insensitive biphoton coherence time, the previous article did not take quantum noise into account. In this work, we employ the Heisenberg-Langevin approach to study this effect and provide a rigorous theoretical proof of the symmetry-protected biphoton coherence by taking quantum noise into consideration, as compared to the perturbation theory in the interaction picture.

TI Success of digital adiabatic simulation with large Trotter step
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB The simulation of adiabatic evolution has deep connections with adiabatic quantum computation, the quantum approximate optimization algorithm, and adiabatic state preparation. Here we address the error analysis problem in quantum simulation of adiabatic process using Trotter formulas. We show that with additional conditions, the circuit depth can be linear in simulation time T. The improvement comes from the observation that the fidelity error here can't be estimated by the norm distance between evolution operators. This phenomenon is termed the robustness of discretization in digital adiabatic simulation. It can be explained in three steps, from analytical and numerical evidence: (1) The fidelity error should be estimated by applying adiabatic theorem on the effective Hamiltonian instead. (2) Because of the specialty of Riemann-Lebesgue lemma, most adiabatic process is naturally robust against discretization. (3) As the Trotter step gets larger, the spectral gap of effective Hamiltonian tends to close, which results in the failure of digital adiabatic simulation.

TI Topological Josephson junctions in the integer quantum Hall regime
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Robust and tunable topological Josephson junctions (TJJs) are highly desirable platforms for investigating the anomalous Josephson effect and topological quantum computation applications. Experimental demonstrations have been done in hybrid superconducting-two dimensional topological insulator (2DTI) platforms, sensitive to magnetic disorder and interactions with phonons and other electrons. In this work, we propose a robust and electrostatically tunable TJJ by combining the physics of the integer quantum Hall (IQH) regime and of superconductors. We provide analytical insights about the corresponding Andreev bound state spectrum, the Josephson current and the anomalous current. We demonstrate the existence of protected zero-energy crossings, that can be controlled through electrostatic external gates. This electrostatic tunability has a direct advantage to compensate for non-ideal interfaces and undesirable reflections that may occur in any realistic samples. TJJs in the IQH regime could be realized in graphene and other 2D materials. They are of particular relevance towards scalable and robust Andreev-qubit platforms, and also for efficient phase batteries.

TI Dirac Theory in Noncommutative Phase Spaces
SO PHYSICS
AB Based on the position and momentum of noncommutative relations with a noncanonical map, we study the Dirac equation and analyze its parity and time reversal symmetries in a noncommutative phase space. Noncommutative parameters can be endowed with the Planck length and cosmological constant such that the noncommutative effect can be interpreted as an effective gauge potential or a (0,2)-type curvature associated with the Plank constant and cosmological constant. This provides a natural coupling between dynamics and spacetime geometry. We find that a free Dirac particle carries an intrinsic velocity and force induced by the noncommutative algebra. These properties provide a novel insight into the Zitterbewegung oscillation and the physical scenario of dark energy. Using perturbation theory, we derive the perturbed and nonrelativistic solutions of the Dirac equation. The asymmetric vacuum gaps of particles and antiparticles reveal the particle-antiparticle symmetry breaking in the noncommutative phase space, which provides a clue to understanding the physical mechanisms of particle-antiparticle asymmetry and quantum decoherence through quantum spacetime fluctuation.

TI An Efficient E-Voting System for Business Intelligence Innovation Based
   on Blockchain
SO JOURNAL OF THE KNOWLEDGE ECONOMY
AB Business intelligence (BI) is driven by data and provides valuable business insights and decision support through data analysis, mining, and visualization. The application of blockchain technology in electronic voting can make the voting process more fair and transparent. This is because the decentralized nature of blockchain technology ensures that voting data is not lost due to a single central server failure and also mitigates the risk of data tampering. However, electronic voting still faces security issues that are not easily resistant to quantum attacks. To address these challenges, we propose post-quantum cryptography and verifiable random functions for secure and efficient business intelligence electronic voting. Firstly, we propose a post-quantum verifiable random function algorithm that can resist quantum computer attacks. Secondly, we introduce a consensus algorithm based on random functions to achieve fast and efficient consensus. Thirdly, we propose a blockchain architecture based on the consensus algorithm to achieve secure and efficient blockchain applications. By integrating post-quantum verifiable random functions, consensus algorithms, and blockchain technology, we present an efficient business intelligence electronic voting system. Implementation and comparison with relevant designs demonstrate that this system provides efficient and secure electronic voting services for business intelligence users. Furthermore, the efficient consensus algorithm can be utilized to improve other blockchain applications or decentralized applications.

TI Experimental verification of the inertial theorem control protocols
SO NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB An experiment based on a trapped ytterbium ion validates the inertial theorem for the SU(2) algebra. The qubit is encoded within the hyperfine states of the atom and controlled by RF fields. The inertial theorem generates analytical solutions for non-adiabatically driven systems that are 'accelerated' slowly, bridging the gap between the sudden and adiabatic limits. These solutions are shown to be stable to small deviations, both experimentally and theoretically. By encoding a two-level system into hyperphine structure of a trapped ytterbium, we explore the high control over the system dynamics in order to validate range of applicability of the inertial theorem in our system. For large deviations from the inertial condition, the experimental results show that the phase remains accurate while the amplitude diverges, so the inertial theorem has good robustness in the phase estimate. As a result, we experimentally showed that the inertial solutions pave the way to rapid quantum control of closed, as well as open quantum systems.

TI Quantum steering with vector vortex photon states with the detection
   loophole closed
SO NPJ QUANTUM INFORMATION
AB Violating a nonlocality inequality enables the most powerful remote quantum information tasks and fundamental tests of quantum physics. Loophole-free photonic verification of nonlocality has been achieved with polarization-entangled photon pairs, but not with states entangled in other degrees of freedom. Here we demonstrate completion of the quantum steering nonlocality task, with the detection loophole closed, when entanglement is distributed by transmitting a photon in an optical vector vortex state, formed by optical orbital angular momentum (OAM) and polarization. As well as opening up a high-efficiency encoding beyond polarization, the critically important demonstration of vector vortex steering opens the door to new free-space and satellite-based secure quantum communication devices and device-independent protocols.

TI Improving readout in quantum simulations with repetition codes
SO QUANTUM SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB Near term quantum computers suffer from the presence of different noise sources. In order to mitigate for this effect and acquire results with significantly better accuracy, there is the urge of designing efficient error correction or error mitigation schemes. The cost of such techniques is usually high in terms of resource requirements, either in hardware or at the algorithmic level. In this work, we follow a pragmatic approach and we use repetition codes as scalable schemes with the potential to provide more accurate solutions to problems of interest in quantum chemistry and physics. We investigate different repetition code layouts and we propose a circular repetition scheme with connectivity requirements that are native on IBM Quantum hardware. We showcase our approach in multiple IBM Quantum devices and validate our results using a simplified theoretical noise model. We highlight the effect of using the proposed scheme in an electronic structure variational quantum eigensolver calculation and in the simulation of time evolution for a quantum Ising model.

TI Optimal Broadband Frequency Conversion via a Magnetomechanical
   Transducer
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW APPLIED
AB Developing schemes for efficient and broadband frequency conversion of quantum signals is an ongoing challenge in the field of modern quantum information. The coherent conversion between microwave and optical signals is an especially important milestone towards long-distance quantum communication. In this work, we propose a two-stage conversion protocol, employing a resonant interaction between magnetic and mechanical excitations as a mediator between microwave and optical photons. Based on estimates for the coupling strengths under optimized conditions for yttrium iron garnet, we predict close to unity conversion efficiency without the requirement of matching cooperativities. We predict a conversion band-width in the regions of largest efficiency of the order of magnitude of the coupling strengths that can be further increased at the expense of reduced conversion efficiency.

TI Efficient Large-Scale Many-Body Quantum Dynamics via Local-Information
   Time Evolution
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB During time evolution of many-body systems entanglement grows rapidly, limiting exact simulations to small-scale systems or small timescales. Quantum information tends, however, to flow towards larger scales without returning to local scales, such that its detailed large-scale structure does not directly affect local observables. This allows for the removal of large-scale quantum information in a way that preserves all local observables and gives access to large-scale and large-time quantum dynamics. To this end, we use the recently introduced information lattice to organize quantum information into different scales, allowing us to define local information and information currents that we employ to systematically discard longrange quantum correlations in a controlled way. Our approach relies on decomposing the system into subsystems up to a maximum scale and time evolving the subsystem density matrices by solving the subsystem von Neumann equations in parallel. Importantly, the information flow needs to be preserved during the discarding of large-scale information. To achieve this without the need to make assumptions about the microscopic details of the information current, we introduce a second scale at which information is discarded, while using the state at the maximum scale to accurately obtain the information flow. The resulting algorithm, which we call local-information time evolution, is highly versatile and suitable for investigating many-body quantum dynamics in both closed and open quantum systems with diverse hydrodynamic behaviors. We present results for the energy transport in the mixed-field Ising model and the magnetization transport in the XX spin chain with onsite dephasing where we accurately determine the power-law exponent and the diffusion coefficients. Furthermore, the information lattice framework employed here promises to offer insightful results about the spatial and temporal behavior of entanglement in many-body systems.

TI Genuine non-Gaussian entanglement of light and quantum coherence for an
   atom from noisy multiphoton spin-boson interactions
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Harnessing entanglement and quantum coherence plays a central role in advancing quantum technologies. In quantum optical light-atom platforms, these two fundamental resources are often associated with a JaynesCummings model description describing the coherent exchange of a photon between an optical resonator mode and a two-level spin. In a generic nonlinear spin-boson system, more photons and more modes will take part in the interactions. Here we consider such a generalization: the two-mode multiphoton Jaynes-Cummings (MPJC) model. We demonstrate how entanglement and quantum coherence can be optimally generated and subsequently manipulated in experimentally accessible parameter regimes. A detailed comparative analysis of this model reveals that nonlinearities within the MPJC interactions produce genuinely non-Gaussian entanglement, devoid of Gaussian contributions, from noisy resources. More specifically, strong coherent sources may be replaced by weaker, incoherent ones, significantly reducing the resource overhead, though at the expense of reduced efficiency. At the same time, increasing the multiphoton order of the MPJC interactions expedites the entanglement generation process, thus rendering the whole generation scheme again more efficient and robust. We further explore the use of additional dispersive spin-boson interactions and Kerr nonlinearities in order to create spin coherence solely from incoherent sources and to enhance the quantum correlations, respectively. As for the latter, somewhat unexpectedly, there is not necessarily an increase in quantum correlations due to the augmented nonlinearity. Towards possible applications of the MPJC model, we show how, with appropriately chosen experimental parameters, we can engineer arbitrary NOON states as well as the tripartite W state.

SO PHYSICAL REVIEW E
AB Considering an entropy-based division of energy transferred into heat and work, we develop an alternative theoretical framework for the thermodynamic analysis of two-level systems. When comparing these results with those obtained using the standard definitions of these quantities, we observe the appearance of a different term of work, which represents the energy cost of rotating the Bloch vector in the presence of the external field that defines the local Hamiltonian. Additionally, we obtain explicit expressions for the temperature, the heat capacity, and the internal entropy production of the system in both paradigms. In order to illustrate our findings we study, from both perspectives, matter-radiation interaction processes for two different systems.

We predict the optimal annealing temperatures for the formation of VVs at high temperature and show how to engineer the Fermi level of the material to optimize the defect's yield for several polytypes of silicon carbide.

While universal quantum computers have been shown to support up to hundreds of qubits, the scale of quantum annealers has reached three orders of magnitude (i.e., thousands of qubits). Therefore, quantum algorithms are becoming increasingly popular in a variety of fields, with optimization being one of the most prominent. This work aims to explore the topic of quantum optimization by comprehensively evaluating the technologies provided by D-Wave Systems. To do so, a model for the energy optimization of data centers is proposed as a benchmark. D-Wave quantum and hybrid solvers are compared, in order to identify the most suitable one for the considered application. To highlight its advantageous performance capabilities and associated solving potential, the selected D-Wave hybrid solver is then contrasted with CPLEX, a highly efficient classical solver.

TI Pattern QUBOs: Algorithmic Construction of 3SAT-to-QUBO Transformations
SO ELECTRONICS
AB One way of solving 3sat instances on a quantum computer is to transform the 3sat instances into instances of Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimizations (QUBOs), which can be used as an input for the QAOA algorithm on quantum gate systems or as an input for quantum annealers. This mapping is performed by a 3sat-to-QUBO transformation. Recently, it has been shown that the choice of the 3sat-to-QUBO transformation can significantly impact the solution quality of quantum annealing. It has been shown that the solution quality can vary up to an order of magnitude difference in the number of correct solutions received, depending solely on the 3sat-to-QUBO transformation. An open question is: what causes these differences in the solution quality when solving 3sat-instances with different 3sat-to-QUBO transformations? To be able to conduct meaningful studies that assess the reasons for the differences in the performance, a larger number of different 3sat-to-QUBO transformations would be needed. However, currently, there are only a few known 3sat-to-QUBO transformations, and all of them were created manually by experts, who used time and clever reasoning to create these transformations. In this paper, we will solve this problem by proposing an algorithmic method that is able to create thousands of new and different 3sat-to-QUBO transformations, and thus enables researchers to systematically study the reasons for the significant difference in the performance of different 3sat-to-QUBO transformations. Our algorithmic method is an exhaustive search procedure that exploits properties of 4x4 dimensional pattern QUBOs, a concept which has been used implicitly in the creation of 3sat-to-QUBO transformations before, but was never described explicitly. We will thus also formally and explicitly introduce the concept of pattern QUBOs in this paper.

TI Deterministic preparation of a dual-species two-ion crystal
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB The demand for efficient preparation methods for dual-species ion crystals is rapidly expanding across quantum technology and fundamental physics applications with trapped ions. We present a deterministic and efficient technique to produce such crystals, utilizing the segmented structure of a linear Paul trap. By precisely tailoring the trapping potentials, we can split, move, and discard parts of an ion chain. This process is automated in a sequence that converts a larger ion sample into the desired configuration. A critical component of our approach is the accurate identification of crystal constituents. This is achieved by matching the measured positions of fluorescing ions against theoretical expectations for larger crystals, thus facilitating the detection of nonfluorescing ions and enabling accurate ion counting. We demonstrate that our method reliably produces two-ion crystals within minutes. These results represent a significant advance in the production of two-species ion crystals with applications ranging from quantum logic spectroscopy and optical clocks to quantum computing and simulations with trapped ions.

TI Computable Renyi mutual information: Area laws and correlations
SO QUANTUM
AB The mutual information is a measure of classical and quantum correlations of great interest in quantum information. It is also relevant in quantum many-body physics, by virtue of satisfying an area law for thermal states and bounding all correlation functions. However, calculating it exactly or approximately is often challenging in practice. Here, we consider alternative definitions based on Renyi divergences. Their main advantage over their von Neumann counterpart is that they can be expressed as a variational problem whose cost function can be efficiently evaluated for families of states like matrix product operators while preserving all desirable properties of a measure of correlations. In particular, we show that they obey a thermal area law in great generality, and that they upper bound all correlation functions. We also investigate their behavior on certain tensor network states and on classical thermal distributions.

TI Robust Security With Strong Authentication in Mobile Cloud Computing
   Based on Trefoil Congruity Framework
SO JOURNAL OF ORGANIZATIONAL AND END USER COMPUTING
AB Mobile cloud computing (MCC) initially draws on cloud and mobile computing principles, where it focuses on wireless networks to provide mobile users with rich computing services. In the modern era, the sharing of secured large-scale data is the major challenging task. However, problems continue to be resolved such that the omnipresent usage and use of mobile cloud computing are feasible. Some of the challenges include security, lossless back-up and data recovery, and computational complexity. To deal with this scenario, a unique combination of the trefoil congruity framework is proposed to secure a privacy-preserving user consent solution by using the backup method to store and recover a huge amount of data. Quantum key fibo privacy approach (QKFPA) encrypts and decrypts the data using the fibonacci chain-leaning matrix along with quantum computation to provide security while transmitting/unloading user information. Consecutively, high-security distribution and rake technology (HSDRT) is enhanced to block the inside attackers and ensures retrieval of saved data without any loss. Once the storage is enhanced, data access is highly secured through the emperor-imperial technique, which generates an imperial label between mobile users and cloud server through the selection of emperor node. The outcome of the work offers great fortification for cyber threats, authentication, and lossless retrieval of data in MCCs.

TI Aspheric lens design proposal for near-perfect mode-matching of a
   broadband quantum dot micropillar to a single-mode fiber
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB Quantum dots in micropillars are one of the most promising options for a bright, deterministic single photon source. While highly efficient devices (>95%) have been designed, there remains a significant bottleneck that impacts the overall system efficiency: the large numerical aperture of the output mode. This leads to inefficient coupling of emitted photons into single-mode fiber (SMF), thus limiting practical integration into quantum computing and communication architectures. We show that with the addition of a well designed aspheric SiO2 microlens we can decrease the mode-matching losses to a SMF from 83.1% to <0.1(0.1)%. This can result in a single photon source design with 96.4(0.1)% end-to-end efficiency, paving the way for scalable photonic quantum technologies.

TI Bidirectional microwave-optical transduction based on integration of
   high-overtone bulk acoustic resonators and photonic circuits
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Coherent interconversion between microwave and optical frequencies can serve as both classical and quantum interfaces for computing, communication, and sensing. Here, we present a compact microwave-optical transducer based on monolithic integration of piezoelectric actuators on silicon nitride photonic circuits. Such an actuator couples microwave signals to a high-overtone bulk acoustic resonator defined by the silica cladding of the optical waveguide core, suspended to enhance electromechanical and optomechanical couplings. At room temperature, this triply resonant piezo-optomechanical transducer achieves an off-chip photon number conversion efficiency of 1.6 x 10-5 over a bandwidth of 25 MHz at an input pump power of 21 dBm. The approach is scalable in manufacturing and does not rely on superconducting resonators. As the transduction process is bidirectional, we further demonstrate the synthesis of microwave pulses from a purely optical input. Capable of leveraging multiple acoustic modes for transduction, this platform offers prospects for frequency-multiplexed qubit interconnects and microwave photonics at large.
   Coherent interconversion between microwave and optical frequencies is crucial for developing quantum networks. To this end, the authors integrate piezoelectric actuators on photonic integrated circuits, enabling bidirectional transduction mediated by high-overtone bulk acoustic resonances.

TI Variational quantum non-orthogonal optimization
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB Current universal quantum computers have a limited number of noisy qubits. Because of this, it is difficult to use them to solve large-scale complex optimization problems. In this paper we tackle this issue by proposing a quantum optimization scheme where discrete classical variables are encoded in non-orthogonal states of the quantum system. We develop the case of non-orthogonal qubit states, with individual qubits on the quantum computer handling more than one bit classical variable. Combining this idea with Variational Quantum Eigensolvers (VQE) and quantum state tomography, we show that it is possible to significantly reduce the number of qubits required by quantum hardware to solve complex optimization problems. We benchmark our algorithm by successfully optimizing a polynomial of degree 8 and 15 variables using only 15 qubits. Our proposal opens the path towards solving real-life useful optimization problems in today's limited quantum hardware.

TI Single-Photon Emission from Individual Nanophotonic-Integrated Colloidal
   Quantum Dots
SO ACS PHOTONICS
AB Solution-processible colloidal quantum dots (CQDs) hold great promise for realizing single-photon sources embedded into scalable quantum technology platforms. However, the high-yield integration of large numbers of individually addressable CQDs in a photonic circuit has remained an outstanding challenge. Here, we report on integrating individual colloidal core-shell QDs into a nanophotonic network that allows for excitation and efficient collection of single photons via separate waveguide channels. An iterative electron beam lithography process provides a viable method to position single emitters at predefined positions on a chip with a yield that approaches unity. Our work moves beyond the bulk optic paradigm of confocal microscopy and paves the way for supplying chip-scale quantum networks with single photons from large numbers of simultaneously controllable quantum emitters.

TI Fast generation of the non-trivial ground states of the Agassi model
   with a quantum simulator
SO PHYSICS LETTERS B
AB Here we present a superadiabatic scheme on a quantum computer to quickly prepare the ground state of the Agassi model, a typical quadrupole plus pairing model with broad applications in nuclear physics as well as many-body systems. By virtue of the Floquet -engineering counterdiabatic driving, this method can accelerate the conventional quantum adiabatic driving without extra control fields. Compared to the adiabatic protocol, the resulting scheme allows for a drastic increase in the final fidelity within a short evolution time, which can effectively inhibit the decoherence effects in quantum simulators. Numerical simulations demonstrate the feasibility of this proposal for fast generating the ground state of Agassi model with different sites. This research opens an avenue for future quantum simulations, and provides a useful method to address currently unanswered questions in nuclear physics using intermediate-scale quantum coprocessors.

AB Blockchain technology has made significant success, but it is also vulnerable for cyberattacks. As a particular form of attacks, Black Bird 51% hash rate attack has not been studied in depth, and it deserves particular attention. It is important to analyze its core construction, origin, and perniciousness. Black Bird Attack (BBA) could jeopardize a decentralized system more than centralized one, because centralized system has higher priority to control the dataflow than its users, whereas decentralized systems are vulnerable to attack, since everyone has almost the same privilege. Black Bird Attack can potentially destroy the fairness of blockchain networks. With this in mind, we have built a blockchain network simulation to examine this form of attacks, as presented in a detailed case study. This case study demonstrates Black Bird Attack is completely possible. Since Black Bird 51% hash rate attack is particularly dangerous in the post-quantum computing era, an intensive research agenda on this topic is in urgent need. (C) 2021 The Authors.

TI Ancillary Gaussian modes activate the potential to witness
   non-Markovianity
SO NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB We study how the number of employed modes impacts the ability to witness non-Markovian evolutions via correlation backflows in continuous-variable quantum dynamics. We first prove the existence of non-Markovian Gaussian evolutions that do not show any revivals in the correlations between the mode evolving through the dynamics and a single ancillary mode. We then demonstrate how this scenario radically changes when two ancillary modes are considered. Indeed, we show that the same evolutions can show correlation backflows along a specific bipartition when three-mode states are employed, and where only one mode is subjected to the evolution. These results can be interpreted as a form of activation phenomenon in non-Markovianity detection and are proven for two types of correlations, entanglement and steering, and two classes of Gaussian evolutions, a classical noise model and the quantum Brownian motion model.

TI Motional ground-state cooling of single atoms in state-dependent optical
   tweezers
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Laser cooling of single atoms in optical tweezers is a prerequisite for neutral atom quantum computing and simulation. Resolved sideband cooling comprises a well-established method for efficient motional ground-state preparation, but typically requires careful cancellation of light shifts in so-called magic traps. Here, we study a novel laser cooling scheme which overcomes such constraints, and applies when the ground state of a narrow cooling transition is trapped stronger than the excited state. We demonstrate our scheme, which exploits sequential addressing of red sideband transitions via frequency chirping of the cooling light, at the example of 88Sr atoms and report ground-state populations compatible with recent experiments in magic tweezers. The scheme also induces light-assisted collisions, which are key to the assembly of large atom arrays. Our work enriches the toolbox for tweezer-based quantum technology, also enabling applications for tweezer-trapped molecules and ions that are incompatible with resolved sideband cooling conditions.

TI Experimental Demonstration of Remotely Creating Wigner Negativity via
   Quantum Steering
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB Non-Gaussian states with Wigner negativity are of particular interest in quantum technology due to their potential applications in quantum computing and quantum metrology. However, how to create such states at a remote location remains a challenge, which is important for efficiently distributing quantum resource between distant nodes in a network. Here, we experimentally prepare an optical non-Gaussian state with negative Wigner function at a remote node via local non-Gaussian operation and shared Gaussian entangled state existing quantum steering. By performing photon subtraction on one mode, Wigner negativity is created in the remote target mode. We show that the Wigner negativity is sensitive to loss on the target mode, but robust to loss on the mode performing photon subtraction. This experiment confirms the connection between the remotely created Wigner negativity and quantum steering. As an application, we present that the generated non-Gaussian state exhibits metrological power in quantum phase estimation.

TI Majorana bound state manipulation by current pulses
SO SUPERCONDUCTOR SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY
AB Majorana bound states (MBSs) can occur in Josephson junctions of conventional s-wave superconductors coupled via a strong topological insulator. In configurations of multiple line junctions meeting at a point, the criterion for the MBS to exist coincides with the presence of a fractional Josephson vortex with 2 pi phase winding. We investigate the dynamic stability of such vortices in arrays of tri- and quad-junctions. The existence of fractional vortices in arrays is demonstrated, but the dynamic stability is found to depend critically on the current-phase relation and the inductance. We propose the idea, and study the feasibility, of manipulating the location of the vortices in arrays by using current pulses, compatible with rapid single flux quantum technology. It is shown theoretically, using a modified resistively shunted junction model, that braiding operations can be achieved using current pulses injected from the edge of the array. It is necessary to use vortex sites with elevated critical current as traps.

TI Phase analysis on the error scaling of entangled qubits in a 53-qubit
   system
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB We have studied carefully the behaviors of entangled qubits on the IBM Rochester with various connectivities and under a "noisy" environment. A phase trajectory analysis based on our measurements of the GHZ-like states is performed. Our results point to an important fact that entangled qubits are "protected" against environmental noise by a scaling property that impacts only the weighting of their amplitudes. The reproducibility of most measurements has been confirmed within a reasonably short gate operation time. But there still are a few combinations of qubits that show significant entanglement evolution in the form of transitions between quantum states. The phase trajectory of an entangled evolution, and the impact of the sudden death of GHZ-like states and the revival of newly excited states are analyzed in details. All observed trajectories of entangled qubits arise under the influences of the newly excited states in a "noisy" intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) computer.

TI Photon Statistics Modal Reconstruction by Detected and Undetected Light
SO ADVANCED QUANTUM TECHNOLOGIES
AB A novel technique is introduced for the reconstruction of multimode optical fields, based on simultaneously exploiting both the generalized Glauber's K-th-order correlation function g(K)$g<^>{(K)}$ and a recently proposed anti-correlation function (dubbed theta(K)$\theta <^>{(K)}$) which is resilient to Poissonian noise. It is experimentally demonstrated that this method yields mode reconstructions with higher fidelity with respect to those obtained with reconstruction methods based only on g(K)$g<^>{(K)}$'s, even requiring less "a priori" information. The reliability and versatility of this technique make it suitable for a widespread use in real applications of optical quantum measurement, from quantum information to quantum metrology, especially when one needs to characterize ensembles of single-photon emitters in the presence of background noise (due, for example, to residual excitation laser, stray light or unwanted fluorescence).

AB Quantum computing is important for science and industry as it offers the potential to solve certain complex problems and perform calculations significantly faster than classical computers. Quantum computing systems evolved from monolithic systems towards modular architectures comprising multiple quantum processing units (QPUs) coupled to classical computing nodes (HPC). With the increasing scale, middleware systems that facilitate the efficient coupling of quantum-classical computing are becoming critical. Through an in-depth analysis of quantum applications, integration patterns and systems, we identified a gap in understanding Quantum-HPC middleware systems. We present a conceptual middleware to facilitate reasoning about quantum-classical integration and serve as the basis for a future middleware system. A key contribution of this paper lies in leveraging well-established high-performance computing abstractions for managing workloads, tasks, and resources to seamlessly integrate quantum computing into HPC systems.

TI Narrow inhomogeneous distribution of spin-active emitters in silicon
   carbide
SO APPLIED PHYSICS LETTERS
AB Optically active solid-state spin registers have demonstrated their unique potential in quantum computing, communication, and sensing. Realizing scalability and increasing application complexity require entangling multiple individual systems, e.g., via photon interference in an optical network. However, most solid-state emitters show relatively broad spectral distributions, which hinders optical interference experiments. Here, we demonstrate that silicon vacancy centers in semiconductor silicon carbide (SiC) provide a remarkably small natural distribution of their optical absorption/emission lines despite an elevated defect concentration of
   approximate to 0.43
   mu
   m
   - 3. In particular, without any external tuning mechanism, we show that only 13 defects have to be investigated until at least two optical lines overlap within the lifetime-limited linewidth. Moreover, we identify emitters with overlapping emission profiles within diffraction-limited excitation spots, for which we introduce simplified schemes for the generation of computationally relevant Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger and cluster states. Our results underline the potential of the CMOS-compatible SiC platform toward realizing networked quantum technology applications.

TI Computational phase transitions: benchmarking Ising machines and quantum
   optimisers
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICS-COMPLEXITY
AB While there are various approaches to benchmark physical processors, recent findings have focused on computational phase transitions. This is due to several factors. Importantly, the hardest instances appear to be well-concentrated in a narrow region, with a control parameter allowing uniform random distributions of problem instances with similar computational challenge. It has been established that one could observe a computational phase transition in a distribution produced from coherent Ising machine(s). In terms of quantum approximate optimisation, the ability for the quantum algorithm to function depends critically on the ratio of a problems constraint to variable ratio (called density). The critical density dependence on performance resulted in what was called, teachability deficits. In this perspective we recall the background needed to understand how to apply computational phase transitions in various bench-marking tasks and we survey several such contemporary findings.

TI Multidimensional four-wave mixing signals detected by quantum squeezed

SO PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF

AB Four-wave mixing (FWM) of optical fields has been extensively used in quantum information processing, sensing, and memories. It also forms a basis for nonlinear spectroscopies such as transient grating, stimulated Raman, and photon echo where phase matching is used to select desired components of the third-order response of matter. Here we report an experimental study of the two-dimensional quantum noise intensity difference spectra of a pair of squeezed beams generated by FWM in hot Rb vapor. The measurement reveals details of the x((3)) susceptibility dressed by the strong pump field which induces an AC Stark shift, with higher spectral resolution compared to classical measurements of probe and conjugate beam intensities. We demonstrate how quantum correlations of squeezed light can be utilized as a spectroscopic tool which unlike their classical counterparts are robust to external noise.

TI Optimizing Josephson Junction Reproducibility in 30 kV E-Beam
   Lithography: An Analysis of Backscattered Electron Distribution
SO NANOMATERIALS
AB This paper explores methods to enhance the reproducibility of Josephson junctions, which are crucial elements in superconducting quantum technologies, when employing the Dolan technique in 30 kV e-beam processes. The study explores the influence of dose distribution along the bridge area on reproducibility, addressing challenges related to fabrication sensitivity. Experimental methods include e-beam lithography, with electron trajectory simulations shedding light on the behavior of backscattered electrons. Wedescribe the fabrication of various Josephson junction geometries and analyze the correlation between the success rates of different lithography patterns and the simulated distribution of backscattered electrons. Our findings demonstrate a success rate of up to 96.3% for the double-resist 1-step low-energy e-beam lithography process. As a means of implementation strategy, we provide a geometric example that takes advantage of simulated stability regions to administer a controlled, uniform dose across the junction area, introducing novel features to overcome the difficulties associated with fabricating bridge-like structures.

TI Efficiency of optimal control for noisy spin qubits in diamond
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW APPLIED
AB Decoherence is a major challenge for quantum technologies, whose negative effects can be mitigated by quantum optimal control. The decoherence dynamics significantly varies depending on the characteristics of the system's environment, consequently affecting the optimization outcomes. In this work, we investigate the optimization of a negatively charged nitrogen-vacancy (NV-) center qubit-spin-inversion control pulse, and observe two error-compensation mechanisms, depending on how long the correlation time is compared to the pulse duration. Additionally, we analyze the effects of control space constraints and optimization options to identify a strategy to improve the optimization performance. Finally, we present experimental realizations of the optimized pulses, exhibiting the applicability of the procedure. Our work serves as a generic yet essential guide to implementing optimal control in the presence of realistic noise.

TI An Inexact Feasible Quantum Interior Point Method for Linearly
   Constrained Quadratic Optimization
SO ENTROPY
AB Quantum linear system algorithms (QLSAs) have the potential to speed up algorithms that rely on solving linear systems. Interior point methods (IPMs) yield a fundamental family of polynomial-time algorithms for solving optimization problems. IPMs solve a Newton linear system at each iteration to compute the search direction; thus, QLSAs can potentially speed up IPMs. Due to the noise in contemporary quantum computers, quantum-assisted IPMs (QIPMs) only admit an inexact solution to the Newton linear system. Typically, an inexact search direction leads to an infeasible solution, so, to overcome this, we propose an inexact-feasible QIPM (IF-QIPM) for solving linearly constrained quadratic optimization problems. We also apply the algorithm to (1)-norm pound soft margin support vector machine (SVM) problems, and demonstrate that our algorithm enjoys a speedup in the dimension over existing approaches. This complexity bound is better than any existing classical or quantum algorithm that produces a classical solution.

TI Long-wavelength optical lattices from optical beatnotes: Theory and
   applications
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB We present a theoretical analysis of BeatNote Superlattices (BNSLs), a recently demonstrated technique for generating periodic trapping potentials for ultracold atomic clouds, with arbitrarily large lattice spacings while maintaining interferometric stability. By combining two optical lattices with slightly different wavelengths, a beatnote intensity pattern is formed, generating, for low depths, an effective lattice potential with a periodicity equal to the wavelength associated to the difference between the wave vectors of the two lattices. We study the range of lattice depths and wavelengths under which this approximation is valid and investigate its robustness against perturbations. We present a few examples where the use of BNSLs could offer significant advantages in comparison to well-established techniques for the manipulation of ultracold atomic gases. Our results highlight the potential of BNSLs for quantum simulation, atom interferometry, and other applications in quantum technologies.

In parallel, the creation of twisted cuprate heterostructures through cryogenic stacking techniques marks a pivotal step forward, exploiting cuprate superconductors to deepen our understanding of exotic quantum states and propel next-generation quantum technologies. This review explores over three decades of research in the emerging field of cuprate twistronics, examining both experimental breakthroughs and theoretical progress. It also highlights the methodologies poised to surmount the outstanding challenges in leveraging these complex quantum materials, underscoring their potential to expand the frontiers of quantum science and technology.

TI Stable entanglement and one-way steering via engineering of a
   single-atom reservoir
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB In this paper, we reexamine the quantum correlations in a four-state single-atom system in the weak coupling regime, aiming at the realization of stable entanglement and one-way steering via dissipation rather than coherent evolution process. Under the near-resonant conditions, we find out that a single atom can act as a reservoir and behave like a two-level system with a single dissipation channel, through which the composite Bogoliubov mode will evolve into a vacuum state, resulting in the appearance of stationary entanglement between two original modes. In addition, the one-way steering is generated when the symmetry is broken by choosing asymmetrical coupling constants. The present scheme may provide convenience tor experimental implement and find applications in quantum information processing.

SO EUROPEAN PHYSICAL JOURNAL C
AB Analytically continuing the von Neumann entropy from Renyi entropies is a challenging task in quantum field theory. While the n-th Renyi entropy can be computed using the replica method in the path integral representation of quantum field theory, the analytic continuation can only be achieved for some simple systems on a case-by-case basis. In this work, we propose a general framework to tackle this problem using classical and quantum neural networks with supervised learning. We begin by studying several examples with known von Neumann entropy, where the input data is generated by representing Tr rho An\documentclass[12pt]{minimal} \usepackage{amsmath} \usepackage{wasysym} \usepackage{amsfonts} \usepackage{amssymb} \usepackage{amsbsy} \usepackage{mathrsfs} \usepackage{upgreek} \setlength{\oddsidemargin}{-69pt} \begin{document}$${\text {Tr}}\rho _A<^>n$$\end{document} with a generating function. We adopt KerasTuner to determine the optimal network architecture and hyperparameters with limited data. In addition, we frame a similar problem in terms of quantum machine learning models, where the expressivity of the quantum models for the entanglement entropy as a partial Fourier series is established. Our proposed methods can accurately predict the von Neumann and Renyi entropies numerically, highlighting the potential of deep learning techniques for solving problems in quantum information theory.

TI Novel characterization of dopant-based qubits
SO MRS BULLETIN
AB Silicon is a leading qubit platform thanks to the exceptional coherence times that can be achieved and to the available commercial manufacturing platform for integration. Building scalable quantum processing architectures relies on accurate quantum state manipulation, which can only be achieved through a complete understanding of the underlying quantum state properties. This article reviews the electrical methods that have been developed to probe the quantum states encoded in individual and interacting atom qubits in silicon, from the pioneering single electron-tunneling spectroscopy framework in nanoscale transistors, to radio frequency reflectometry to probe coherence properties and scanning tunneling microscopy to directly image the wave function at the atomic scale. Together with the development of atomistic simulations of realistic devices, these methods are today applied to other emerging dopant and optically addressable defect states to accelerate the engineering of quantum technologies in silicon.

AB The amount of interconnections between the milli Kelvin stage of a quantum computer to the ambient environment where the control electronics may reside is a limiting constraint in realizing scalable, many-qubit quantum computers. This limitation can be overcome by integrating the control electronics onto CMOS ASICs that operate at 4 K in physical proximity to the qubits. Such instrumentation relies, in part, on CMOS system building blocks such as voltage-controlled oscillators (VCO) in order to control and readout qubits, drive internal circuitry such as memories and state machines, and to communicate with the user. However, CMOS design and performance of VCOs at cryogenic conditions is not well characterized and accurate cryogenic design models do not exist. We design a VCO capable of operation at 300 K and characterize it down to 8 K, and we extract critical circuit parameters across temperature that will aid future cryogenic-CMOS designs.

TI Gain in performance of teleportation with uniformity-breaking
   distributions
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Prior information about an input state can be utilized to enhance the efficiency of quantum teleportation, which we quantify using the first two moments of fidelity. The input knowledge is introduced by relaxing the uniformity assumption in the distribution of the input state and considering nonuniform distributions, namely, the polar cap and von Mises-Fisher densities. For these distributions, we show that the average fidelity increases depending on the shared resource state between the sender and the receiver, while the deviation decreases with the increase of information content about the input ensemble, thereby establishing its role as a resource. Our comparative study between these two distributions reveals that for the same amount of information content about inputs, although the average fidelity yield is the same for both, the polar cap distribution is better as it offers a smaller deviation. Moreover, we contrast the resource of prior information with other resources involved in the protocol such as shared entanglement and classical communication. Specifically, we observe that unlike a uniform distribution, the amount of classical communication required to fulfill the task decreases with the increase of information available for inputs. We also investigate the role of prior information in higher- (three-)dimensional teleportation and report the characteristics of the dimensional advantage in prior information-based teleportation.

Quantum computing has been investigated with promising results in areas related to database management, such as query optimization, transaction scheduling, and index tuning. Promising results have also been seen when reinforcement learning is applied for database tuning in classical computing. However, there is no existing research with implementation details and experiment results for index tuning that takes advantage of both quantum computing and reinforcement learning. This paper proposes a new algorithm called QRLIT that uses the power of quantum computing and reinforcement learning for database index tuning. Experiments using the database TPC-H benchmark show that QRLIT exhibits superior performance and a faster convergence compared to its classical counterpart.

TI On the Magnetization and Entanglement Plateaus in One-Dimensional
   Confined Molecular Magnets
SO MAGNETOCHEMISTRY
AB One-dimensional (1D) magnetic systems offer rich phenomena in the quantum limit, proving more chemically accessible than zero-dimensional or higher-dimensional frameworks. Single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNT) have recently been used to encapsulate trimetric nickel(II) acetylacetonate [Nanoscale, 2019, 11, 10615-10621]. Here, we investigate the magnetization on spin chains based on nickel trimers by Matrix Product State (MPS) simulations. Our findings reveal plateaus in the exchange/magnetic-field phase diagram for three coupling configurations, showcasing effective dimeric and trimeric spin-ordering with similar or staggered entanglement across chains. These ordered states allow the qubit-like tuning of specific local magnetic moments, exhibiting disengagement or uniform coupling in entanglement plateaus. This behavior is consistent with the experimental transition from frustrated (3D) to non-frustrated (1D) molecules, corresponding to large and smaller SWCNT diameters. Our study offers insights into the potential of 1D-confined trimers for quantum computation, extending beyond the confinement of trimetric nickel-based molecules in one dimension.

TI Many-Objective Quantum-Inspired Particle Swarm Optimization Algorithm
   for Placement of Virtual Machines in Smart Computing Cloud
SO ENTROPY
AB Particle swarm optimization algorithm (PSO) is an effective metaheuristic that can determine Pareto-optimal solutions. We propose an extended PSO by introducing quantum gates in order to ensure the diversity of particle populations that are looking for efficient alternatives. The quality of solutions was verified in the issue of assignment of resources in the computing cloud to improve the live migration of virtual machines. We consider the multi-criteria optimization problem of deep learning-based models embedded into virtual machines. Computing clouds with deep learning agents can support several areas of education, smart city or economy. Because deep learning agents require lots of computer resources, seven criteria are studied such as electric power of hosts, reliability of cloud, CPU workload of the bottleneck host, communication capacity of the critical node, a free RAM capacity of the most loaded memory, a free disc memory capacity of the most busy storage, and overall computer costs. Quantum gates modify an accepted position for the current location of a particle. To verify the above concept, various simulations have been carried out on the laboratory cloud based on the OpenStack platform. Numerical experiments have confirmed that multi-objective quantum-inspired particle swarm optimization algorithm provides better solutions than the other metaheuristics.

TI Heralding entangled optical photons from a microwave quantum processor
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW APPLIED
AB Exploiting the strengths of different quantum hardware components may increase the capabilities of emerging quantum processors. Here we propose and analyze a quantum architecture that leverages the nonlocal connectivity of optics, along with the exquisite quantum control offered by superconducting microwave circuits, to produce entangled optical resource states. In contrast to previous proposals on optically distributing entanglement between superconducting microwave processors, we use squeezing between microwaves and optics to produce microwave-optical Bell pairs in a dual-rail encoding from a single microwave quantum processor. Moreover, the microwave quantum processor allows us to deterministically entangle microwave-optical Bell pairs into larger cluster states, from which entangled optical photons can be extracted through microwave measurements. Our scheme paves the way for small microwave quantum processors to create heralded entangled optical resource states for optical quantum computation, communication, and sensing using imperfect microwave-optics transducers. We expect that improved isolation of the superconducting processor from stray optical fields will allow the scheme to be demonstrated with currently available hardware.

TI Electron transport in quantum channels with spin-orbit interaction:
   effects of the sign of the Rashba coupling and applications to nanowires
SO NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB We investigate the effects of the sign of the Rashba spin-orbit coupling (RSOC) on electron transmission through a single-channel nanowire (NW) in the quantum coherent regime. We show that, while for a finite length NW with homogeneous RSOC contacted to two electrodes the sign of its RSOC does not affect electron transport, the situation can be quite different in the presence of an inhomogeneous RSOC and a magnetic field applied along the NW axis. By analyzing transport across an interface between two regions of different RSOC we find that, if the two regions have equal RSOC signs, the transmission within the magnetic gap energy range is almost perfect, regardless of the ratio of the spin-orbit energies to the Zeeman energy. In contrast, when the two regions have opposite RSOC signs and are Rashba-dominated, the transmission gets suppressed. Furthermore, we discuss the implementation on a realistic NW setup where two RSOC regions are realized with suitably coupled gates separated by a finite distance. We find that the low-temperature NW conductance exhibits a crossover from a short distance behavior that strongly depends on the relative RSOC sign of the two regions to a large distance oscillatory behavior that is independent of such relative sign. We are thus able to identify the conditions where the NW conductance mainly depends on the sign of the RSOC and the ones where only the RSOC magnitude matters.

TI Dephasing-assisted preparation of asymmetric steering in coupled quantum
   wells
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB It is shown that the dephasing rates are usually harmful for quantum correlations in various systems. Nevertheless, we explore that the dephasing rates in the coupled quantum wells (QWs), as a major contribution of the decay processes, can assist to generate one-way EinsteinPodolsky-Rosen (EPR) steering. By applying two strong fields to drive two dipole-allowed transitions while the other transitions are coupled with two quantized modes, the asymmetric EPR steering is possible to obtain at steady state through a single-pathway dissipation in the three-well system. According to dressed-state and Bogoliubov mode transformation, we find that the dephasing rates play a role in modifying the dressed-state populations and the dissipation rate through multiple quantum interference mechanisms. The positive effect of the dephasing rates from a nanostructure on quantum correlation is expected to find potential applications in quantum information processing.

TI Secret-Extraction Attacks against Obfuscated Instantaneous Quantum
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB Quantum computing devices can now perform sampling tasks that, according to complexity-theoretic and numerical evidence, are beyond the reach of classical computers. This raises the question of how one can efficiently verify that a quantum computer operating in this regime works as intended. In 2008, Shepherd and Bremner proposed a protocol in which a verifier constructs a unitary from the comparatively easy-to-implement family of so-called IQP circuits and challenges a prover to execute it on a quantum computer. The challenge problem is designed to contain an obfuscated secret, which can be turned into a statistical test that accepts samples from a correct quantum implementation. It was conjectured that extracting the secret from the challenge problem is NP-hard, so that the ability to pass the test constitutes strong evidence that the prover possesses a quantum device and that it works as claimed. Unfortunately, about a decade later, Kahanamoku-Meyer found an efficient classical secret-extraction attack. Bremner, Cheng, and Ji very recently followed up by constructing a wide-ranging generalization of the original protocol. Their IQP Stabilizer Scheme has been explicitly designed to circumvent the known weakness. They also suggested that the original construction can be made secure by adjusting the problem parameters. In this work, we develop a number of secret-extraction attacks that are effective against both new approaches in a wide range of problem parameters. In particular, we find multiple ways to recover the 300-bit secret hidden in a challenge data set published by Bremner, Cheng, and Ji. The important problem of finding an efficient and reliable verification protocol for sampling-based proofs of quantum advantage thus remains open.

TI Giant Two-Level Systems in a Granular Superconductor
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB Disordered thin films are a common choice of material for superconducting, high impedance circuits used in quantum information or particle detector physics. A wide selection of materials with different levels of granularity are available, but, despite low microwave losses being reported for some, the high degree of disorder always implies the presence of intrinsic defects. Prominently, quantum circuits are prone to interact with two-level systems (TLS), typically originating from solid state defects in the dielectric parts of the circuit, like surface oxides or tunneling barriers. We present an experimental investigation of TLS in granular aluminum thin films under applied mechanical strain and electric fields. The analysis reveals a class of strongly coupled TLS having electric dipole moments up to 30 e & Aring;, an order of magnitude larger than dipole moments commonly reported for solid state defects. Notably, these large dipole moments appear more often in films with a higher resistivity. Our observations shed new light on granular superconductors and may have implications for their usage as a quantum circuit material.

TI Detecting Entanglement in Quantum Many-Body Systems via Permutation
   Moments
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB Multipartite entanglement plays an essential role in both quantum information science and many-body physics. Because of the exponentially large dimension and complex geometric structure of the state space, the detection of entanglement in many-body systems is extremely challenging in reality. Conventional means, like entanglement witness and entropy criterion, either highly depend on the prior knowledge of the studied systems or the detection capability is relatively weak. In this Letter, we propose a framework for designing multipartite entanglement criteria based on permutation moments, which have an effective implementation with either the generalized control-SWAP quantum circuits or the random unitary techniques. As an example, in the bipartite scenario, we develop an entanglement criterion that can detect bound entanglement and show strong detection capability in the multiqubit Ising model with a longrange XY Hamiltonian. In the multipartite case, the permutation-moment-based criteria can detect entangled states that are not detectable by any criteria extended from the bipartite case. Our framework also shows potential in entanglement quantification and entanglement structure detection.

TI Photon-number entanglement generated by sequential excitation of a
   two-level atom
SO NATURE PHOTONICS
AB Entanglement and spontaneous emission are fundamental quantum phenomena that drive many applications of quantum physics. During the spontaneous emission of light from an excited two-level atom, the atom briefly becomes entangled with the photonic field. Here we show that this natural process can be used to produce photon-number entangled states of light distributed in time. By exciting a quantum dot-an artificial two-level atom-with two sequential pi-pulses, we generate a photon-number Bell state. We characterize this state using time-resolved intensity and phase correlation measurements. Furthermore, we theoretically show that applying longer sequences of pulses to a two-level atom can produce a series of multi-temporal mode entangled states with properties intrinsically related to the Fibonacci sequence. Our results on photon-number entanglement can be further exploited to generate new states of quantum light with applications in quantum technologies.

TI Bermudan option pricing by quantum amplitude estimation and Chebyshev
   interpolation
SO EPJ QUANTUM TECHNOLOGY
AB Pricing of financial derivatives, in particular early exercisable options such as Bermudan options, is an important but heavy numerical task in financial institutions, and its speed-up will provide a large business impact. Recently, applications of quantum computing to financial problems have been started to be investigated. In this paper, we first propose a quantum algorithm for Bermudan option pricing. This method performs the approximation of the continuation value, which is a crucial part of Bermudan option pricing, by Chebyshev interpolation, using the values at interpolation nodes estimated by quantum amplitude estimation. In this method, the number of calls to the oracle to generate underlying asset price paths scales as (O) over tilde(epsilon(-1)), where epsilon is the error tolerance of the option price. This means the quadratic speed-up compared with classical Monte Carlo-based methods such as least-squares Monte Carlo, in which the oracle call number is (O) over tilde(epsilon(-2)).

TI Towards Quantum Ray Tracing
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON VISUALIZATION AND COMPUTER GRAPHICS
AB Rendering on conventional computers is capable of generating realistic imagery, but the computational complexity of these light transport algorithms is a limiting factor of image synthesis. Quantum computers have the potential to significantly improve rendering performance through reducing the underlying complexity of the algorithms behind light transport. This article investigates hybrid quantum-classical algorithms for ray tracing, a core component of most rendering techniques. Through a practical implementation of quantum ray tracing in a 3D environment, we show quantum approaches provide a quadratic improvement in query complexity compared to the equivalent classical approach. Based on domain specific knowledge, we then propose algorithms to significantly reduce the computation required for quantum ray tracing through exploiting image space coherence and a principled termination criteria for quantum searching. We show results obtained using a simulator for both Whitted style ray tracing, and for accelerating ray tracing operations when performing classical Monte Carlo integration for area lights and indirect illumination.

We explain how to combine recent deep learning advances with the well known technique of quantum walks applied to a Metropolis algorithm. The result, QFold, is a fully scalable hybrid quantum algorithm that, in contrast to previous quantum approaches, does not require a lattice model simplification and instead relies on the much more realistic assumption of parameterization in terms of torsion angles of the amino acids. We compare it with its classical analog for different annealing schedules and find a polynomial quantum advantage, and implement a minimal realization of the quantum Metropolis in IBMQ Casablanca quantum system.

TI Secure key distribution exploiting error rate criticality for radio
   frequency links
SO ROYAL SOCIETY OPEN SCIENCE
AB We propose a method by which two radio frequency (RF) communication terminals exchange encryption keys or other data securely. This method draws on the approach developed for quantum key distribution (QKD) for detecting eavesdroppers but our method does not use any quantum properties at all. Instead, by exploiting the effects an eavesdropper has on channel stability, we explore a line-ofsight link radio in which data transfer rates are so high as to approach the Shannon limit. With very steep rises in bit error rate accompanying a small degradation of signal-to-noise limits for certain forward error correction codes, it becomes possible to infer the existence of an eavesdropper before they are able to obtain a complete key. We describe our method and analyse one possible implementation using low density parity check codes with quadrature phase shift keying modulation. The proposed technique is in principle far easier to implement than quantum-based approaches for RF and optical wireless links since the required hardware is readily available and the basic principles are well known and well understood. Finally, we show our method to have a higher key rate and spectral efficiency than those of QKD.

TI Heralded preparation of spin qubits in droplet-etched GaAs quantum dots
   using quasiresonant excitation
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
AB We present a comprehensive study on heralded spin preparation employing excited state resonances of droplet-etched GaAs quantum dots. This achievement will facilitate future investigations of spin qubit based quantum memories using the GaAs quantum dot material platform. By observation of excitation spectra for a range of fundamental excitonic transitions, the properties of different quantum dot energy levels, i.e., shells, are revealed. The innovative use of polarization-resolved excitation and detection in the context of quasiresonant excitation spectroscopy of quantum dots greatly simplifies the determination of the spin preparation fidelities-irrespective of the relative orientations of laboratory and quantum dot polarization eigenbases. By employing this method, spin preparation fidelities of quantum dot ground states of up to 85% are found. Additionally, the characteristic nonradiative decay time is investigated as a function of ground state, excitation resonance, and excitation power level, yielding decay times as low as 29 ps for s-p shell exited state transitions. Finally, by time-resolved correlation spectroscopy it is demonstrated that the employed excitation scheme has a significant impact on the electronic environment of quantum dot transitions and their apparent brightness.

TI Quantum Carleman linearization efficiency in nonlinear fluid dynamics
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) is a specialized branch of fluid mechanics that utilizes numerical methods and algorithms to solve and analyze fluid-flow problems. One promising avenue to enhance CFD is the use of quantum computing, which has the potential to resolve nonlinear differential equations more efficiently than classical computers. Here, we try to answer the question of which regimes of nonlinear partial differential equations for fluid dynamics can have an efficient quantum algorithm. We propose a connection between the numerical parameter R, which guarantees efficiency in the truncation of the Carleman linearization, and the physical parameters that describe the fluid flow. This link can be made thanks to the Kolmogorov scale, which determines the minimum size of the grid needed to properly resolve the energy cascade induced by the nonlinear term. Additionally, we introduce the formalism for vector field simulation in different spatial dimensions, providing the discretization of the operators and the boundary conditions.

TI Mechanism of Electron-Beam Manipulation of Single-Dopant Atoms in
   Silicon
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY C
AB The precise positioning of dopant atoms within bulk crystal lattices could enable novel applications in areas including solid-state sensing and quantum computation. Established scanning probe techniques are capable tools for the manipulation of surface atoms, but at a disadvantage due to their need to bring a physical tip into contact with the sample. This has prompted interest in electron-beam techniques, followed by the first proof-of-principle experiment of bismuth dopant manipulation in crystalline silicon. Here, we use first-principles modeling to discover a novel indirect exchange mechanism that allows electron impacts to non-destructively move dopants with atomic precision within the silicon lattice. However, this mechanism only works for the two heaviest group V donors with split-vacancy configurations, Bi and Sb. We verify our model by directly imaging these configurations for Bi and by demonstrating that the promising nuclear spin qubit Sb can be manipulated using a focused electron beam.

TI Improved Grey Wolf-Differential Evolution Algorithm for UAV OAM-MDI-QKD
   Parameter Optimization
SO ADVANCED QUANTUM TECHNOLOGIES
AB The integration of unconditional security of quantum key distribution (QKD) with the flexibility of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) presents significant potential for the deployment of comprehensive quantum networks. However, imperfect components of practical QKD systems offer avenues for eavesdropping, while the limited payload capacity and vibrations of UAVs present substantial challenges. This paper introduces an orbital angular momentum (OAM) encoding strategy combined with decoy-state and the measurement-device-independent QKD (MDI-QKD) protocol to address security issues and reference frame misalignment in UAV-based QKD systems. Nevertheless, the communication performance of the OAM-MDI-QKD system is significantly affected by complex environmental challenges in the airborne channel. To improve the degraded communication performance in airborne platforms, an enhanced grey wolf optimization-differential evolution (GWO-DE) algorithm is developed, utilizing chaotic mapping and a nonlinear decay factor to strengthen global search and convergence capabilities, which effectively addresses the search limitations of local search algorithms (LSA) when dealing with high-dimensional objective functions. Simulation results demonstrate that the GWO-DE algorithm outperforms other traditional optimization algorithms in terms of optimization precision and transmission distance enhancement, with computational speed meeting system requirements.

TI Bosonic entanglement renormalization circuits from wavelet theory
SO SCIPOST PHYSICS
AB Entanglement renormalization is a unitary real-space renormalization scheme. The corresponding quantum circuits or tensor networks are known as MERA, and they are particularly well-suited to describing quantum systems at criticality. In this work we show how to construct Gaussian bosonic quantum circuits that implement entanglement renormalization for ground states of arbitrary free bosonic chains. The construction is based on wavelet theory, and the dispersion relation of the Hamiltonian is translated into a filter design problem. We give a general algorithm that approximately solves this design problem and provide an approximation theory that relates the properties of the filters to the accuracy of the corresponding quantum circuits. Finally, we explain how the continuum limit (a free bosonic quantum field) emerges naturally from the wavelet construction.

TI Quantum-Inspired Algorithms and Perspectives for Optimization
SO ELECTRONICS
AB This paper starts with an updated review and analyzes recent developments in quantum-inspired algorithms for cybersecurity, with specific attention to possible perspectives of optimization. The enhancement of classical computing capabilities with quantum principles is transforming fields such as machine learning, optimization, and cybersecurity. Evolutionary algorithms are one example where progress has already been made using quantum techniques through increased efficiency, generalization, and problem-solving techniques exploited by quantum principles. Quantum-inspired evolutionary algorithms (QIEAs) and quantum kernel methods are prime examples of such approaches. Quantum techniques are also used in the field of cybersecurity: QML-based identification systems for intrusion detection strengthen threat detection and encoding through quantum techniques with advanced cryptographic security, while quantum-secure hashing (QSHA) offers sophisticated means of protecting sensitive information. More specifically, QGANs are known for their integration into adversarial generative networks that increase efficiency by replacing classical models in adversarial defense through the generation of synthetic attack models. In this work, a set of benchmarks is provided for comparison with classical and other quantum-inspired technologies. The results demonstrate that these methods far outperform others in terms of computational efficiency and satisfactory scalability. Although fully functional models are still awaited, quantum computing benefits greatly from quantum-inspired technologies, as the latter enable the development of frameworks that bring us closer to the quantum era. Consequently, the work takes the form of an updated systematic review enriched with optimized perspectives.

TI Application of FPGA Devices in Network Security: A Survey
SO ELECTRONICS
AB Field-Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) are increasingly shaping the future of network security, thanks to their flexibility, parallel processing capabilities, and energy efficiency. In this survey, we examine 50 peer-reviewed studies published between 2020 and 2025, selected from an initial pool of 210 articles based on relevance, hardware implementation, and the presence of empirical performance data. These studies encompass a broad range of topics, including cryptographic acceleration, intrusion detection and prevention systems (IDS/IPS), hardware firewalls, and emerging strategies that incorporate artificial intelligence (AI) and post-quantum cryptography (PQC). Our review focuses on five major application areas: cryptographic acceleration, intrusion detection and prevention systems (IDS/IPS), hardware firewalls, and emerging strategies involving artificial intelligence (AI) and post-quantum cryptography (PQC). We propose a structured taxonomy that organises the field by technical domain and challenge, and compare solutions in terms of scalability, resource usage, and real-world performance. Beyond summarising current advances, we explore ongoing limitations-such as hardware constraints, integration complexity, and the lack of standard benchmarking. We also outline future research directions, including low-power cryptographic designs, FPGA-AI collaboration for detecting zero-day attacks, and efficient PQC implementations. This survey aims to offer both a clear overview of recent progress and a valuable roadmap for researchers and engineers working toward secure, high-performance FPGA-based systems.

TI Continuous-Variable Quantum State Designs: Theory and Applications
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW X
AB We generalize the notion of quantum state designs to infinite-dimensional spaces. We first prove that, under the definition of continuous-variable (CV) state t-designs from [Blume-Kohout et al., Commun. Math. Phys. 326, 755 (2014)], no state designs exist for t >= 2. Similarly, we prove that no CV unitary t-designs exist for t >= 2. We propose an alternative definition for CV state designs, which we call rigged t-designs, and provide explicit constructions for t 1/4 2. As an application of rigged designs, we develop a design-based shadow-tomography protocol for CV states. Using energy-constrained versions of rigged designs, we define an average fidelity for CV quantum channels and relate this fidelity to the CV entanglement fidelity. As an additional result of independent interest, we establish a connection between torus 2-designs and complete sets of mutually unbiased bases.

TI Tunable Non-Markovianity for Bosonic Quantum Memristors
SO ENTROPY
AB We studied the tunable control of the non-Markovianity of a bosonic mode due to its coupling to a set of auxiliary qubits, both embedded in a thermal reservoir. Specifically, we considered a single cavity mode coupled to auxiliary qubits described by the Tavis-Cummings model. As a figure of merit, we define the dynamical non-Markovianity as the tendency of a system to return to its initial state, instead of evolving monotonically to its steady state. We studied how this dynamical non-Markovianity can be manipulated in terms of the qubit frequency. We found that the control of the auxiliary systems affects the cavity dynamics as an effective time-dependent decay rate. Finally, we show how this tunable time-dependent decay rate can be tuned to engineer bosonic quantum memristors, involving memory effects that are fundamental for developing neuromorphic quantum technologies.

TI Finding dense sublattices as low energy states of a Hamiltonian
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Lattice-based cryptography has emerged as one of the most prominent candidates for postquantum cryptography, projected to be secure against the imminent threat of large-scale fault-tolerant quantum computers. The Shortest Vector Problem (SVP) is to find the shortest nonzero vector in a given lattice. It is fundamental to latticebased cryptography and believed to be hard even for quantum computers. We study a natural generalization of the SVP known as the K-Densest Sublattice Problem (K-DSP): to find the densest K-dimensional sublattice of a given lattice. We formulate K-DSP as finding the first excited state of a Z-basis Hamiltonian, making K-DSP amenable to investigation via an array of quantum algorithms, including Grover search, quantum Gibbs sampling, adiabatic, and variational quantum algorithms. The complexity of the algorithms depends on the basis through which the input lattice is presented. We present a classical polynomial-time algorithm that takes an arbitrary input basis and preprocesses it into inputs suited to quantum algorithms. With preprocessing, we prove that O(KN2) qubits suffice for solving K-DSP for N-dimensional input lattices. We empirically demonstrate the performance of a quantum approximate optimization algorithm K-DSP solver for low dimensions, highlighting the influence of a good preprocessed input basis. We then discuss the hardness of K-DSP in relation to the SVP, to see if there is a reason to build postquantum cryptography on K-DSP. We devise a quantum algorithm that solves K-DSP with runtime exponent (5KN log2 N )/2. Therefore, for fixed K, K-DSP is no more than polynomially harder than the SVP. The central insight we use is similar in spirit to those underlying the best-known classical K-DSP algorithm due to Dadush and Micciancio. Whether the exponential dependence on K can be lowered remains an open question.

TI Generic two-mode Gaussian states as quantum sensors
SO QUANTUM SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB Gaussian quantum channels constitute a cornerstone of continuous-variable quantum information science, underpinning a wide array of protocols in quantum optics and quantum metrology. While the action of such channels on arbitrary states is well-characterized under full channel knowledge, we address the inverse problem, namely, the precise estimation of fundamental channel parameters, including the beam splitter transmissivity and the two-mode squeezing amplitude. Employing the quantum Fisher information (QFI) as a benchmark for metrological sensitivity, we demonstrate that the symmetry inherent in mode mixing critically governs the amplification of QFI, thereby enabling high-precision parameter estimation. In addition, we investigate quantum thermometry by estimating the average photon number of thermal states, revealing that the transmissivity parameter significantly modulates estimation precision. Our results underscore the metrological utility of two-mode Gaussian states and establish a robust framework for parameter inference in noisy and dynamically evolving quantum systems.

TI A quantum random access memory (QRAM) using a polynomial encoding of
   binary strings
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB Quantum algorithms claim significant speedup over their classical counterparts for solving many problems. An important aspect of many of these algorithms is the existence of a quantum oracle, which needs to be implemented efficiently in order to realize the claimed advantages in practice. A quantum random access memory (QRAM) is a promising architecture for realizing these oracles. In this paper we develop a new design for QRAM and implement it with Clifford+T circuit. We focus on optimizing the T-count and T-depth since non-Clifford gates are the most expensive to implement fault-tolerantly in most error correction schemes. Integral to our design is a polynomial encoding of bit strings and so we refer to this design as QRAM(poly). Compared to the previous state-of-the-art bucket brigade architecture for QRAM, we achieve an exponential improvement in T-depth, while reducing T-count and keeping the qubit-count same. Specifically, if N is the number of memory locations to be queried, then QRAM(poly) has T-depth O(log log N), T-count O(N-log N) and uses O(N) logical qubits, while the bucket brigade circuit has T-depth O(log N), T-count O(N) and uses O(N) qubits. Combining two QRAM(poly) we design a quantum look-up-table, qLUT(poly), that has T-depth O(log log N), T-countO root(N) and qubit count O root(N). A quantum look-up table (qLUT) or quantum read-only memory (QROM) has restricted functionality than a QRAM. For example, it cannot write into a memory location and the circuit needs to be compiled each time the contents of the memory change. The previous state-of-the-art CSWAP architecture has T-depth O root(N), T-count O root(N) and qubit count O root(N). Thus we achieve a double exponential improvement in T-depth while keeping the T-count and qubit-count asymptotically same. Additionally, with our polynomial encoding of bit strings, we develop a method to optimize the Toffoli-count of circuits, specially those consisting of multi-controlled-NOT gates.

TI Background reduction in PET by double Compton scattering of quantum
   entangled annihilation photons
SO JOURNAL OF INSTRUMENTATION
AB The reduction of background events, such as random and scatter events, can improve positron emission tomography (PET) images quantitatively. The quantum entanglement property of annihilation photons has been theoretically studied and experimentally validated. Recently, simulation studies on PET image reconstruction using the quantum entanglement property of annihilation photons and studies on the measurement of entanglement and polarization properties with scintillation crystal arrays demonstrated that PET images with less background can be achieved. This study utilized the quantum entanglement property of annihilation photons in a typical PET system with block detectors. A data acquisition method for quantum entanglement PET (QEPET) and system response modelling for QEPET image reconstruction were proposed and implemented. An experimental study was conducted using a small animal PET system composed of Ce:GAGG scintillation crystals whose dimensions are 2.5 x 2.5 x 4mm3. The diameter of the system was 79.3 mm. Signals from all individual crystals were processed parallelly and independently; thus, Compton scatter and absorption crystals within a module were obtained directly. The 28 MBq experiment result revealed the random background ratio of QEPET was approximately 20% lower than that of PET and the count rate of QEPET was approximately 0.1% that of PET. Evaluation on reconstructed images from the 28 MBq experiment revealed that the signal-to-background ratio of QEPET was approximately two times better than that of PET while the signal-to-noise ratio of QEPET was about 77% of that of PET. The method proposed in this study is expected to improve PET images with high background, such as those with a high activity and high background gamma rays and improve range verification in proton therapy.

TI Hyperbolic Topological Quantum Sources

However, Limited by the Bulk-edge Correspondence, the Implementation of Topological Boundary Channels Necessitates a Substantial Number of Bulk Sites, Which Notably Diminishes the Ratio of Ring Resonators to Generate Quantum Sources. How to Achieve Topologically-protected Quantum Sources With the Extremely Enhanced Utilization Efficiency of Optical Resonators Remains a Challenge. Here, the First Realization of Hyperbolic Topological Quantum Sources is reported, Which Possess a Dominated Number of Boundary Resonators Than That in the Bulk Domain. Specifically, Hyperbolic Topological Quantum Sources Require Fewer Resources (i.e., the number of ring resonators) to Achieve the Same Level of Brightness Compared With Euclidean Topological Quantum Sources. Furthermore, the Robust Correlated- and Entangled-photon Pairs Are Measured. The Work Possesses Potential Applications in Integrable Quantum Circuits and Suggests a Novel Way on the Exploration of Quantum Physics in Non-Euclidean Space.

TI Cooling photon-pressure circuits into the quantum regime
SO SCIENCE ADVANCES
AB Quantum control of electromagnetic fields was initially established in the optical domain and has been advanced to lower frequencies in the gigahertz range during the past decades extending quantum photonics to broader frequency regimes. In standard cryogenic systems, however, thermal decoherence prevents access to the quantum regime for photon frequencies below the gigahertz domain. Here, we engineer two superconducting LC circuits coupled by a photon-pressure interaction and demonstrate sideband cooling of a hot radio frequency (RF) circuit using a microwave cavity. Because of a substantially increased coupling strength, we obtain a large single-photon quantum cooperativity C-q0 similar to 1 and reduce the thermal RF occupancy by 75% with less than one pump photon. For larger pump powers, the coupling rate exceeds the RF thermal decoherence rate by a factor of 3, and the RF circuit is cooled into the quantum ground state. Our results lay the foundation for RF quantum photonics.

TI Subliminal Channels in CRYSTALS-Kyber Key-Encapsulation Mechanism and
   Their Use in Quantum-Resistant TLS Protocols
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB Cryptographic protocols can be used to covertly exchange information without arousing suspicion. The covert channels created in this way are called subliminal channels. In this work, three different subliminal channels using CRYSTALS-Kyber are discovered. Kyber is employed in the Module-Lattice-based Key-Encapsulation Mechanism (ML-KEM) standard published in FIPS 203. In the found subliminal channels, the covert message is embedded in the random data needed by the encapsulation or the key generation algorithms. Two settings are differentiated depending on if the covert receiver is an overt entity executing the key exchange protocol or a man-in-the-middle. An important feature achieved by the proposed subliminal channels is plausible deniability. Covert entities can convince a jury that they did not use a subverted version of the original Kyber algorithms by showing the random data used in the protocol, the values exchanged, and the outputs of the algorithms. The proposed subliminal channels can be used in quantum-resistant proposals of TLS (Transport Layer Security). Concretely, this work explores the use of the proposed subliminal channels in PQTLS and KEMTLS. Also, some countermeasures are proposed in the paper. Experimental results show that the overhead in execution times is not significant and that from 2 to 34 bytes of covered information can be transmitted per TLS handshake.

TI Arbitrarily structured quantum emission with a multifunctional metalens
SO ELIGHT
AB Structuring light emission from single-photon emitters (SPEs) in multiple degrees of freedom is of great importance for quantum information processing towards higher dimensions. However, traditional control of emission from quantum light sources relies on the use of multiple bulky optical elements or nanostructured resonators with limited functionalities, constraining the potential of multi-dimensional tailoring. Here we introduce the use of an ultrathin polarisation-beam-splitting metalens for the arbitrary structuring of quantum emission at room temperature. Owing to the complete and independent polarisation and phase control at the single meta-atom level, the designed metalens enables simultaneous mapping of quantum emission from ultra-bright defects in hexagonal boron nitride and imprinting of an arbitrary wavefront onto orthogonal polarisation states of the sources. The hybrid quantum metalens enables simultaneous manipulation of multiple degrees of freedom of a quantum light source, including directionality, polarisation, and orbital angular momentum. This could unleash the full potential of solid-state SPEs for their use as high-dimensional quantum sources for advanced quantum photonic applications.

TI Maximal steered coherence in the background of Schwarzschild space-time
SO EUROPEAN PHYSICAL JOURNAL C
AB In the past two decades, the exploration of quantumness within Schwarzschild spacetime has garnered significant interest, particularly regarding the Hawking radiation's impact on quantum correlations and quantum coherence. Building on this foundation, we investigate how Hawking radiation influences maximal steered coherence (MSC)-a crucial measure for gauging the ability to generate coherence through steering. We find that as the Hawking temperature increases, the physically accessible MSC degrade while the unaccessible MSC increase. This observation is attributed to a redistribution of the initial quantum correlations, previously acknowledged by inertial observers, across all bipartite modes. In particular, we find that in limit case that the Hawking temperature tends to infinity, the accessible MSC equals to 1 / 2 \documentclass[12pt]{minimal} \usepackage{amsmath} \usepackage{wasysym} \usepackage{amsfonts} \usepackage{amssymb} \usepackage{amsbsy} \usepackage{mathrsfs} \usepackage{upgreek} \setlength{\oddsidemargin}{-69pt} \begin{document}$$1/\sqrt{2}$$\end{document} of its initial value, and the unaccessible MSC between mode A and B <overline> \documentclass[12pt]{minimal} \usepackage{amsmath} \usepackage{wasysym} \usepackage{amsfonts} \usepackage{amssymb} \usepackage{amsbsy} \usepackage{mathrsfs} \usepackage{upgreek} \setlength{\oddsidemargin}{-69pt} \begin{document}$$\overline{B}$$\end{document} also equals to the same value. Our findings illuminate the intricate dynamics of quantum information in the vicinity of black holes, suggesting that Hawking radiation plays a pivotal role in reshaping the landscape of quantum coherence and entanglement in curved spacetime. This study not only advances our theoretical understanding of black hole thermodynamics but also opens new avenues for investigating the interface between quantum mechanics and general relativity.

TI Efficient implementation of post-quantum digital signatures on Raspberry
   Pi
SO DISCOVER APPLIED SCIENCES
AB While quantum computing poses a threat to many classical cryptographic schemes such as RSA and ECC, the quest for quantum-resistant alternatives has seen rapid growth. We provide one of the most detailed yet real-world demonstrations of the NIST-PQC lattice-based digital signature schemes, being the Dilithium family: Dilithium2, Dilithium3, and Dilithium5, being implemented and evaluated on a single-embedded platform, Raspberry Pi 4 Model B. We deliver a more deep-seated portrayal, giving details on platform-determined performance optimizations, performance trade-offs, and energy consumption characteristics, identifying Dilithium2 as a well-balanced prospect for quantum-safe deployments in the context of IoT and the edge. Notably, our work encompasses an empirical comparison with Dilithium and Falcon schemes with respect to implementation practicality, side-channel consideration, and resource overhead. Falcon has compact signatures, but its integration in an embedded context poses a challenge because it uses floating-point arithmetic and Gaussian sampling. Our experiments, performed on stress-tested hardware, show that Dilithium is not only as secure as required by post-quantum security standards but also operates reliably in low-resource environments. An interactive benchmarking toolkit and open-source codebase provide further reproducibility and potential for future work. We thereby give an applied basis to the practical use of quantum-secure digital signatures in constrained devices.

TI Nonlocal Exciton-Photon Interactions in Hybrid High-Q Beam Nanocavities
   with Encapsulated MoS2 Monolayers
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB Atomically thin semiconductors can be readily integrated into a wide range of nanophotonic architectures for applications in quantum photonics and novel optoelectronic devices. We report the observation of nonlocal interactions of ???free??? trions in pristine hBN/MoS2/hBN heterostructures coupled to single mode (Q > 104) quasi 0D nanocavities. The high excitonic and photonic quality of the interaction system stems from our integrated nanofabrication approach simultaneously with the hBN encapsulation and the maximized local cavity field amplitude within the MoS2 monolayer. We observe a nonmonotonic temperature dependence of the cavity-trion interaction strength, consistent with the nonlocal light-matter interactions in which the extent of the center-of-mass (c.m.) wave function is comparable to the cavity mode volume in space. Our approach can be generalized to other optically active 2D materials, opening the way toward harnessing novel light-matter interaction regimes for applications in quantum photonics.

TI Dynamical Purification and the Emergence of Quantum State Designs from
   the Projected Ensemble
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB Quantum thermalization in a many-body system is defined by the approach of local subsystems toward a universal form, describable as an ensemble of quantum states wherein observables acquire thermal expec-tation values. Recently, it has been demonstrated that the distribution of these quantum states can also exhibit universal statistics, upon associating each state with the outcome of a local projective measurement of the complementary subsystem. Specifically, this collection of pure quantum states-called the projected ensemble-can, under certain conditions, mimic the behavior of a maximally entropic uniformly random ensemble, i.e., form a quantum state design, representing a "deeper" form of quantum thermalization. In this work, we investigate the dynamical process underlying this novel emergent universality. Leveraging a space-time duality mapping for one-dimensional quantum circuits, we argue that the physics of dynamical purification, which arises in the context of monitored quantum systems, constrains the approach of the projected ensemble toward the uniform distribution. We prove that the absence of dynamical purification in the space-time dual dynamics (a condition realized in dual-unitary quantum circuits with appropriate initial states and final measurement bases) generically yields exact state designs for all moments k at the same time, extending previous rigorous results [Ho and Choi, Phys. Rev. Lett. 128, 060601 (2022)]. Con-versely, we show that, departing from these conditions, dynamical purification can lead to a separation of time scales between the formation of a quantum state design for moment k = 1 (regular thermaliza-tion) and for high moments k >> 1 (deep thermalization). Our results suggest that the projected ensemble can probe nuanced features of quantum dynamics inaccessible to regular thermalization, such as quantum information scrambling.

TI Optimizing low-carbon strategies in dual-channel supply chains: A
   quantum game perspective
SO PLOS ONE
AB The carbon emission management and resource allocation optimization of dual-channel supply chain are of great significance for promoting low-carbon economy and improving supply chain efficiency. In contrast to conventional game theory, Quantum game theory can describe the cooperation and competition of online and offline channels more flexibly through quantum entanglement, so as to overcome the limitations of traditional game theory. We study the application of quantum game theory in low-carbon economy and pricing strategies, and explore how to optimize pricing strategies and improve the low-carbon levels under different entanglement. Therefore, considering consumers' preference for low-carbon products, this paper establishes a quantum game model to encourage low-carbon actions in the dual-channel supply chain. We discuss three models of centralized decision making, decentralized decision and quantum equilibrium, and analyze the optimal strategies of manufacturers under different entanglement. The results show that quantum game theory has significant advantages in low-carbon dual-channel supply chains. With the increase of quantum entanglement, the low-carbon production level and corporate profitability in the supply chain have been significantly improved, especially under the decentralized decision-making framework, quantum game equilibrium can promote low-carbon behavior and improve profits more than traditional game models. When the degree of entanglement approaches infinity, the total profit of supply chain enterprises using quantum strategy exceeds the profit of supply chain enterprises with centralized decision-making. It is important to note that quantum entanglement can significantly reduce the optimal wholesale and online sales prices for manufacturers. At the same time, the impact of quantum game on manufacturers' decision-making is more significant than that on retailers, indicating that quantum entanglement shows different sensitivities in influencing the pricing and profitability strategies of different supply chain participants. This finding provides a new theoretical perspective and practical guidance for pricing strategies, firm cooperation and competition in low-carbon supply chains.

TI Proto-Quipper with Reversing and Control
SO ELECTRONIC PROCEEDINGS IN THEORETICAL COMPUTER SCIENCE
CT 22nd International Conference on Quantum Physics and Logic (QPL)
CY JUL 14-18, 2025
CL Varna, BULGARIA
AB The quantum programming language Quipper supports circuit operations such as reversing and controlling certain quantum circuits. Additionally, Quipper provides a function called with-computed, which can be used to program circuits of the form g; f; g dagger. The latter is a common pattern in quantum circuit design. One benefit of using with-computed, as opposed to constructing the circuit g; f; g(dagger )directly from g, f, and g dagger, is that it facilitates an important optimization. Namely, if the resulting circuit is later controlled, only f needs to be controlled; the circuits g and g dagger need not even be controllable. In this paper, we formalize a semantics for reversible and controllable circuits, using a dagger symmetric monoidal category R to interpret reversible circuits, and a new notion we call a controllable category N, which encompasses the control and with-computed operations in Quipper. We extend the language Proto-Quipper with reversing, control and the with-computed operation. Since not all circuits are reversible and/or controllable, we use a type system with modalities to track reversibility and controllability. This generalizes the modality of Fu-Kishida-Ross-Selinger 2023. We give an abstract categorical semantics, and show that the type system and operational semantics are sound with respect to this semantics.

TI Detecting high-dimensional time-bin entanglement in fiber-loop systems
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Many quantum communication protocols rely on the distribution of entanglement between the different participating parties. One example is quantum key distribution (QKD), an application that has matured to commercial use in recent years. However, difficulties remain, especially with noise resilience and channel capacity in long-distance communication. One way to overcome these problems is to use high-dimensional entanglement, which has been shown to be more robust to noise and enables higher secret-key rates. It is therefore important to have access to certifiable high-dimensional entanglement sources to confidently implement these advanced QKD protocols. Here we develop a method for certifying high-dimensional time-bin entanglement in fiber-loop systems. In these systems, entanglement creation and detection can utilize the same physical components, and the number of time bins, and thus the entanglement dimension, can be adapted without making physical changes to the setup. Our certification method builds on previous proposals for the certification of angular-momentum entanglement in photon pairs. In particular, measurements in only two experimentally accessible bases are sufficient to obtain a lower bound on the entanglement dimension for both two- and multiphoton quantum states. Numerical simulations show that the method is robust against typical experimental noise effects and works well even with limited measurement statistics, thus establishing time-bin encoded photons as a promising platform for high-dimensional quantum-communication protocols.

TI Efficient Robust Spontaneous Parametric Down-Conversion via Detuning
   Modulated Composite Segments Designs
SO LASER & PHOTONICS REVIEWS
AB Spontaneous parametric down conversion (SPDC) holds a pivotal role in quantum physics, facilitating the creation of entangled photon pairs, heralded single photons and squeezed light, critical resources for many applications in quantum technologies. However, their production is susceptible to physical variations, posing limitations on their robust utility. To overcome these limitations, this work introduces a method to significantly enhance the reliability of entangled photon pair generation. This approach involves introducing a composite design scheme to the SPDC process. The design is based on the development of a theoretical composite segments framework for SU(1,1), offering increased error resilience and robustness of the process. The practical application is experimentally demonstrated by modulating the nonlinear coefficient of a KTP crystal for degenerate 532-1064 nm conversion, resulting in an effective sevenfold improvement in stability of photon-pair generation and coincidence rate against temperature fluctuations compared to conventional quasi-phase-matching techniques. Furthermore, the presented concept is applicable to other physical systems that exhibit SU(1,1) dynamics. This methodology can create a leap forward in quantum technologies by significantly enhancing stability and error tolerance, thus paving the way for a new generation of entangled photon sources, holding promise for quantum information processing, communication, and precision measurement applications.

TI Polarization Sensitive Imaging with Qubits
SO APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL
AB We compare reconstructed quantum state images of a birefringent sample using direct quantum state tomography and inverse numerical optimization technique. Qubits are used to characterize birefringence in a flat transparent plastic sample by means of polarization sensitive measurement using density matrices of two-level quantum entangled photons. Pairs of entangled photons are generated in a type-II nonlinear crystal. About half of the generated photons interact with a birefringent sample, and coincidence counts are recorded. Coincidence rates of entangled photons are measured for a set of sixteen polarization states. Tomographic and inverse numerical techniques are used to reconstruct the density matrix, the degree of entanglement, and concurrence for each pixel of the investigated sample. An inverse numerical optimization technique is used to obtain a density matrix from measured coincidence counts with the maximum probability. Presented results highlight the experimental noise reduction, greater density matrix estimation, and overall image enhancement. The outcome of the entanglement distillation through projective measurements is a superposition of Bell states with different amplitudes. These changes are used to characterize the birefringence of a 3M tape. Well-defined concurrence and entanglement images of the birefringence are presented. Our results show that inverse numerical techniques improve overall image quality and detail resolution. The technique described in this work has many potential applications.

TI A Lightweight Variant of Falcon for Efficient Post-Quantum Digital
   Signature
SO INFORMATION
AB Conventional public-key cryptographic systems are increasingly threatened by advances in quantum computing, accelerating the need for robust post-quantum cryptographic solutions. Among these, Falcon, a compact lattice-based digital signature scheme, has emerged as a leading candidate in the NIST post-quantum standardization process due to its efficiency and theoretical security grounded in hard lattice problems. This work introduces Falcon-M, a modified version of the Falcon algorithm that significantly reduces implementation complexity. It does so by replacing Falcon's intricate trapdoor-based key-generation mechanism with a simplified approach that utilizes randomized polynomial Gaussian sampling and fast Fourier transform (FFT) operations. Falcon-M incorporates SHA-512 hashing and discrete Gaussian sampling to preserve cryptographic soundness and statistical randomness while maintaining the core structure of Falcon's signing and verification processes. We formally specify the Falcon-M algorithm, provide an updated pseudocode, and offer a comparative analysis with the original Falcon in terms of algorithmic complexity, security assumptions, and implementation overhead. Additionally, we present formal lemmas and theorems to ensure correctness and define theoretical bounds on forgery resistance. Although Falcon-M does not rely on a formal cryptographic trapdoor, we demonstrate that it achieves strong practical security based on assumptions related to the Short Integer Solution (SIS) problem. Falcon-M is thus well-suited for lightweight post-quantum applications, particularly in resource-constrained environments, such as embedded systems and Internet-of-Things (IoT) platforms.

TI Spontaneous parametric down-conversion in bottom-up grown lithium
   niobate microcubes
SO OPTICAL MATERIALS EXPRESS
AB Nonclassical light sources are highly sought-after as they are an integral part of quantum communication and quantum computation devices. Typical sources use bulk nonlinear crystals that rely on stringent phase-matching conditions, limiting the operating wavelength and bandwidth. In this work, we demonstrate the generation of photon pairs from a free-standing lithium niobate microcube at the telecommunication wavelength of 1.56 mu m through the spontaneous parametric down-conversion process. The maximum photon pair generation rate obtained from a single microcube with the size of 3.6 mu m is 490 Hz, resulting in an efficiency of 20.6 GHz/Wm, which is three orders of magnitude larger than the efficiency of biphoton generation in bulk nonlinear crystals. The microcubes are synthesized through a solvothermal method, offering the possibility for scalable devices via bottom-up assembly on any substrates. Our work constitutes an important step forward in the realization of compact nonclassical light sources with a wide bandwidth for various quantum applications.(c) 2022 Optica Publishing Group under the terms of the Optica Open Access Publishing Agreement

TI Efficient high-quality photon pair generation in modal phase-matched
   thin-film lithium niobate micro-ring resonators
SO NANOPHOTONICS
AB Efficient generation of high-quality photon pairs is essential for modern quantum technologies. Micro-ring resonator is an ideal platform for studying on-chip photon sources due to strong nonlinear effect, resonant-enhanced optical fields, and high integration. Thin-film lithium niobate (TFLN) micro-ring resonators with periodically poled quasi-phase matching have shown high-quality photon pair generation. However, periodic poling technology remains expensive and requires complex fabrication hindering its scalability and capability for practical application in nonlinear photonic devices. To address this, we propose a scalable approach using TFLN micro-ring resonators based on modal phase matching to achieve cost-effective, efficient high-quality photon pair generation, significantly simplifying fabrication. We achieved pair generation rates up to 40.2 MHz/mW through spontaneous parametric down-conversion, with coincidence-to-accidental ratios exceeding 1,200. By combining micro-ring resonance enhancement with modal phase matching, our approach reduces device size and fabrication cost while maintaining high nonlinear efficiency. These results advance the development of compact, efficient on-chip photon sources for next-generation nonlinear and quantum photonic applications.

TI Waveguide Quantum Electrodynamics: Tryptophans Entangled with Water as
   Data Qubits in a Microtubule
SO DYNAMICS
AB In this paper, we introduce waveguide Quantum Electrodynamics (wQED) for the description of tryptophans in microtubules representing data qubits for information storage and, possibly, information processing. We propose a Hamiltonian in wQED and derive Heisenberg equations for qubits and photons. Using the Heisenberg equations, we derive time-evolution equations for the probability of qubits and the distribution of photons both at zero and finite temperature. We then demonstrate the resultant sub-radiance with small decay rates, which is required to achieve robust data qubits for information storage by coupling tryptophan residues containing data qubits with water molecules as Josephson quantum filters (JQFs). We also describe an oscillation processes of qubits in a tubulin dimer through the propagation of excitations with changing decay rates of JQFs. Data qubits are found to retain initial values by adopting sub-radiant states involving entanglement with water degrees of freedom.

TI Recent advances in the ab initio theory of solid-state defect qubits
SO NANOPHOTONICS
AB Solid-state defects acting as single photon sources and quantum bits are leading contenders in quantum technologies. Despite great efforts, not all the properties and behaviours of the presently known solid-state defect quantum bits are understood. Furthermore, various quantum technologies require novel solutions, thus new solid-state defect quantum bits should be explored to this end. These issues call to develop ab initio methods which accurately yield the key parameters of solid-state defect quantum bits and vastly accelerate the identification of novel ones for a target quantum technology application. In this review, we describe recent developments in the field including the calculation of excited states with quantum mechanical forces, treatment of spatially extended wavefunctions in supercell models, methods for temperature-dependent Herzberg-Teller fluorescence spectrum and photo-ionisation thresholds, accurate calculation of magneto-optical parameters of defects consisting of heavy atoms, as well as spin-phonon interaction responsible for temperature dependence of the longitudonal spin relaxation T (1) time and magneto-optical parameters, and finally the calculation of spin dephasing and spin-echo times. We highlight breakthroughs including the description of effective-mass like excited states of deep defects and understanding the leading microscopic effect in the spin-relaxation of isolated nitrogen-vacancy centre in diamond.

TI Individually addressable and spectrally programmable artificial atoms in
   silicon photonics
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB A central goal for quantum technologies is to develop platforms for precise and scalable control of individually addressable artificial atoms with efficient optical interfaces. Color centers in silicon, such as the recently-isolated carbon-related G-center, exhibit emission directly into the telecommunications O-band and can leverage the maturity of silicon-on-insulator photonics. We demonstrate the generation, individual addressing, and spectral trimming of G-center artificial atoms in a silicon-on-insulator photonic integrated circuit platform. Focusing on the neutral charge state emission at 1278 nm, we observe waveguide-coupled single photon emission with narrow inhomogeneous distribution with standard deviation of 1.1 nm, excited state lifetime of 8.3 +/- 0.7 ns, and no degradation after over a month of operation. In addition, we introduce a technique for optical trimming of spectral transitions up to 300 pm (55 GHz) and local deactivation of single artificial atoms. This non-volatile spectral programming enables alignment of quantum emitters into 25 GHz telecommunication grid channels. Our demonstration opens the path to quantum information processing based on implantable artificial atoms in very large scale integrated photonics.
   Realising integrated photonic circuits containing isolated telecommunications-wavelength artificial atom single photon emitters is an outstanding challenge in quantum technologies. Here, the authors demonstrate how to embed optically tunable G-centers in silicon-on-insulator integrated circuits.

TI High-performance deterministic in situ electron-beam lithography
   enabled by cathodoluminescence spectroscopy
SO NANO EXPRESS
AB The application of solid-state quantum emitters in real-world quantum information technologies requires precise nanofabrication platforms with high process yield. Self-assembled semiconductor quantum dots with excellent emission properties have proven to be among the best candidates to meet the needs of a number of novel quantum photonic devices. However, their spatial and spectral positions vary statistically on a scale that is far too large for their system integration via fixed lithography and inflexible processing schemes. We solve this severe problem by introducing a flexible and deterministic manufacturing scheme based on precise and convenient cathodoluminescence spectroscopy followed by high-resolution electron-beam lithography. The basics and application examples of this advanced in situ electron-beam lithography are described in this article. Although we focus here on quantum dots as photon emitters, this nanotechnology concept is very well suited for the fabrication of a variety of quantum nanophotonic devices based on quantum emitters that exhibit suitably strong cathodoluminescence signals.

TI Simple PKE schemes from the TSPEM problem
SO AIMS MATHEMATICS
AB In the quantum era, the advent of quantum computers poses significant threats to the security of current cryptosystems. Therefore, designing quantum-resistant cryptoschemes becomes important to guarantee information security. This work concentrates on the development of the postquantum public key encryption (PKE) scheme. Non-commutative cryptography (NCC) has entered the field of post-quantum cryptography. We utilize the TSPEM problem with asymmetric structures (which serve as a potential candiate for resisting quantum attacks) to construct two PKE schemes which are demonstrated to be CPA security under the DTSPEM assumption. By representing the plaintext as a matrix, these schemes can e ff ectively encrypt a significant amount of information in a single operation. Assuming an equal amount of messages for encryption, the proposed schemes acheive superior e ffi ciency compared to existing PKE schemes. Structurally, our systems exhibit a level of synchronization and coexistence due to the distinct public keys ( P) and ciphertexts ( C 1 ). The e ffi ciency analysis is conducted by comparing known schemes from the aspect of specific cryptographic indicators. Generally, the proposed ones o ff er several advantages including provable security, high e ffi ciency, potential quantum-resistant, and relative ease of implementation; along with synchronization and coexistence. Our investigation has established the feasibility of constructing PKE schemes based on the TSPEM problem, specifically for asymmetric communication scenarios. The preliminary results pave the way for further exploration of the TSPEM problem ' s potential in developing other cryptosystems suitable for quantum computing environments.

TI Switching the function of the quantum Otto cycle in non-Markovian
   dynamics: Heat engine, heater, and heat pump
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Quantum thermodynamics explores novel thermodynamic phenomena that emerge when interactions between macroscopic systems and microscopic quantum ones go into action. Among various issues, quantum heat engines, in particular, have attracted much attention as a critical step in theoretical formulation of quantum thermodynamics and investigation of efficient use of heat by means of quantum resources. In the present paper, we focus on heat absorption and emission processes as well as work extraction processes of a quantum Otto cycle. We describe the former as non-Markovian dynamics, and thereby find that the interaction energy between a macroscopic heat bath and a microscopic qubit is not negligible. Specifically, we reveal that the interaction energy is divided into the system and the bath in a region of the short interaction time and remains negative in the region of the long interaction time. In addition, a counterintuitive energy flow from the system and the interaction energy to the hot bath occurs in another region of the short interaction time. We quantify these effects by defining an index of non-Markovianity in terms of the interaction energy. With this behavior of the interaction energy, we show that a non-Markovian quantum Otto cycle can switch functions such as an engine as well as a heater or a heat pump by controlling the interaction time with the heat bath. In particular, the qubit itself loses its energy if we shorten the interaction time, and in this sense, the qubit is cooled through the cycle. This property has a possibility of being utilized for cooling the qubits in quantum computing. We also describe the work extraction from the microscopic system to a macroscopic system like us humans as an indirect measurement process by introducing a work storage as a new reservoir.

TI Purcell-Induced Bright Single Photon Emitters in Hexagonal Boron Nitride
SO NANO LETTERS
AB Single photon emitters (SPEs) in hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) are elementary building blocks for room-temperature on-chip quantum photonic technologies. However, fundamental challenges, such as slow radiative decay and nondeterministic placement of the emitters, limit their full potential. Here, we demonstrate large-area arrays of plasmonic nanoresonators (PNRs) for Purcell-induced room-temperature SPEs by engineering emitter-cavity coupling and enhancing radiative emission. Gold-coated silicon pillars with an alumina spacer enable a 10-fold local-field enhancement in the emission band of native hBN defects. We observe bright SPEs with an average saturated emission rate surpassing 5 million counts per second, an average lifetime of <0.5 ns, and 29% yield. Density functional theory reveals the beneficial role of an alumina spacer between hBN and gold, mitigating the electronic broadening of emission from defects proximal to the metal. Our results offer arrays of bright, heterogeneously integrated single-photon sources, paving the way for robust and scalable quantum information systems.

TI Quantum-enhanced hybrid feature engineering in thoracic CT image
   analysis for state-of-the-art nodule classification: an advanced lung
   cancer assessment
SO BIOMEDICAL PHYSICS & ENGINEERING EXPRESS
AB The intricate nature of lung cancer treatment poses considerable challenges upon diagnosis. Early detection plays a pivotal role in mitigating its escalating global mortality rates. Consequently, there are pressing demands for robust and dependable early detection and diagnostic systems. However, the technological limitations and complexity of the disease make it challenging to implement an efficient lung cancer screening system. AI-based CT image analysis techniques are showing significant contributions to the development of computer-assisted detection (CAD) systems for lung cancer screening. Various existing research groups are working on implementing CT image analysis systems for assessing and classifying lung cancer. However, the complexity of different structures inside the CT image is high and comprehension of significant information inherited by them is more complex even after applying advanced feature extraction and feature selection techniques. Traditional and classical feature selection techniques may struggle to capture complex interdependencies between features. They may get stuck in local optima and sometimes require additional exploration strategies. Traditional techniques may also struggle with combinatorial optimization problems when applied to a prominent feature space. This paper proposed a methodology to overcome the existing challenges by applying feature extraction using Vision Transformer (FexViT) and Feature selection using the Quantum Computing based Quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QC-FSelQUBO) technique. This algorithm shows better performance when compared with other existing techniques. The proposed methodology showed better performance as compared to other existing techniques when evaluated by applying necessary output measures, such as accuracy, Area under roc (receiver operating characteristics) curve, precision, sensitivity, and specificity, obtained as 94.28%, 99.10%, 96.17%, 90.16% and 97.46%. The further advancement of CAD systems is essential to meet the demand for more reliable detection and diagnosis of cancer, which can be addressed by leading the proposed quantum computation and growing AI-based technology ahead.

AB Interference between single photons is key for many quantum optics experiments and applications in quantum technologies, such as quantum communication or computation. It is advantageous to operate the systems at telecommunication wavelengths and to integrate the setups for these applications in order to improve stability, compactness and scalability. A new promising material platform for integrated quantum optics is lithium niobate on insulator (LNOI). Here, we realise Hong-Ou-Mandel (HOM) interference between telecom photons from an engineered parametric down-conversion source in an LNOI directional coupler. The coupler has been designed and fabricated in house and provides close to perfect balanced beam splitting. We obtain a raw HOM visibility of (93.5 & PLUSMN; 0.7) %, limited mainly by the source performance and in good agreement with off-chip measurements. This lays the foundation for more sophisticated quantum experiments in LNOI.& COPY; 2023 Optica Publishing Group under the terms of the Optica Open Access Publishing Agreement

SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Entanglement is a major resource in advanced quantum technology where it can enable a secure exchange of information over large distances. Energy-time entanglement is particularly attractive for its beneficial robustness in fiber-based quantum communication and can be demonstrated in the Franson interferometer. We report on Franson-type interference from a resonantly driven biexciton cascade under continuous wave excitation. Our measurements yield a maximum visibility of (73 & PLUSMN; 2)% surpassing the limit of violation of Bell's inequality (70.7%) by more than one standard deviation. Despite being unable to satisfy a loophole free violation, our work demonstrates promising results concerning future studies on such a system. Furthermore, our systematical investigations on the impact of driving strength indicate that dephasing mechanisms and deviations from the cascaded emission have a major impact on the degree of the measured energy-time entanglement.

TI Estimating Interception Density in the BB84 Protocol: A Study with a
   Noisy Quantum Simulator
SO FUTURE INTERNET
AB Quantum computers have the potential to break the public-key cryptosystems widely used in key exchange and digital signature applications. To address this issue, quantum key distribution (QKD) offers a robust countermeasure against quantum computer attacks. Among various QKD schemes, BB84 is the most widely used and studied. However, BB84 implementations are inherently imperfect, resulting in quantum bit error rates (QBERs) even in the absence of eavesdroppers. Distinguishing between QBERs caused by eavesdropping and QBERs due to channel imperfections is fundamentally infeasible. In this context, this paper proposes and examines a practical method for detecting eavesdropping via partial intercept-and-resend attacks in the BB84 protocol. A key feature of the proposed method is its consideration of quantum system noise. The efficacy of this method is assessed by employing the Quantum Solver library in conjunction with backend simulators inspired by real quantum machines that model quantum system noise. The simulation outcomes demonstrate the method's capacity to accurately estimate the eavesdropper's interception density in the presence of system noise. Moreover, the results indicate that the estimation accuracy of the eavesdropper's interception density in the presence of system noise is dependent on both the actual interception density value and the key length.

TI Converting laser light into single photons with ultralong coherence time

AB Single photons with ultralong coherence time and high indistinguishability are key resources for interference-based photonic quantum technologies. While laser light exhibits excellent coherence, it cannot be attenuated to single photons through linear optics. Here, we demonstrate high-quality single photons coherently reflected from a single quantum dot (QD) coupled to a double-sided optical microcavity and driven by a continuous-wave single-frequency laser in the low-driving regime. Measuring the reflected light without cross-polarization filtering to suppress laser scattering, we observe a second-order correlation of g(2)(0) = 0.030 +/- 0.002 and a two-photon interference visibility of V (0) = 94.3% +/- 0.2%, which remains robust for photon separations up to 8 km. Under weak driving, these photons exhibit an ultralong coherence time of 258 +/- 2 mu s-six orders of magnitude longer than the coherence time (115 ps) of spontaneously emitted photons-directly inherited from the driving laser. The observed anti-bunching arises from single-photon switching governed by the QD's saturation nonlinearity and is further explained by quantum interference between the reflected driving field and incoherent scattering. By inheriting the laser's ultralong first-order coherence and robust photon indistinguishability, coherently scattered single photons hold promise as valuable resources for quantum information science and photonic quantum technologies.

TI Separation of measurement uncertainty into quantum and classical parts
   based on Kirkwood-Dirac quasiprobability and generalized entropy
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICS A-MATHEMATICAL AND THEORETICAL
AB Measurement in quantum mechanics is notoriously unpredictable. The uncertainty in quantum measurement can arise from the noncommutativity between the state and the measurement basis which is intrinsically quantum, but it may also be of classical origin due to the agent's ignorance. It is of fundamental as well as practical importance to cleanly separate the two contributions which can be directly accessed using laboratory operations. Here, we propose two ways of decomposition of the total measurement uncertainty additively into quantum and classical parts. In the two decompositions, the total uncertainty of a measurement described by a positive-operator-valued measure (POVM) over a quantum state is quantified respectively by two generalized nonadditive entropies of the measurement outcomes; the quantum parts are identified, respectively, by the nonreality and the nonclassicality-which captures simultaneously both the nonreality and negativity-of the associated generalized Kirkwood-Dirac quasiprobability relative to the POVM of interest and a projection-valued measure and maximized over all possible choices of the latter; and, the remaining uncertainties are identified as the classical parts. Both decompositions are shown to satisfy a few plausible requirements. The minimum of the total measurement uncertainties in the two decompositions over all POVM measurements are given by the impurity of the quantum state quantified by certain generalized quantum entropies, and are entirely classical. We argue that nonvanishing genuine quantum uncertainty in the two decompositions are sufficient and necessary to prove quantum contextuality via weak measurement with postselection. Finally, we suggest that the genuine quantum uncertainty is a manifestation of a specific measurement disturbance.

TI Multi-species optically addressable spin defects in a van der Waals
   material
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Optically addressable spin defects hosted in two-dimensional van der Waals materials represent a new frontier for quantum technologies, promising to lead to a new class of ultrathin quantum sensors and simulators. Recently, hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) has been shown to host several types of optically addressable spin defects, thus offering a unique opportunity to simultaneously address and utilise various spin species in a single material. Here we demonstrate an interplay between two separate spin species within a single hBN crystal, namely S = 1 boron vacancy defects and carbon-related electron spins. We reveal the S = 1/2 character of the carbon-related defect and further demonstrate room temperature coherent control and optical readout of both S = 1 and S = 1/2 spin species. By tuning the two spin ensembles into resonance with each other, we observe cross-relaxation indicating strong inter-species dipolar coupling. We then demonstrate magnetic imaging using the S = 1/2 defects and leverage their lack of intrinsic quantization axis to probe the magnetic anisotropy of a test sample. Our results establish hBN as a versatile platform for quantum technologies in a van der Waals host at room temperature.
   The 2D material hBN hosts various optically addressable spin defects, promising for quantum technology applications. Here the authors report the co-existence of spin-1 and spin-1/2 defects in hBN, show their room temperature coherent control and optical readout, as well as cross-relaxation.

TI Numerical analysis of quantization-based optimization
SO ETRI JOURNAL
AB We propose a number-theory-based quantized mathematical optimization scheme for various NP-hard and similar problems. Conventional global optimization schemes, such as simulated and quantum annealing, assume stochastic properties that require multiple attempts. Although our quantization-based optimization proposal also depends on stochastic features (i.e., the white-noise hypothesis), it provides a more reliable optimization performance. Our numerical analysis equates quantization-based optimization to quantum annealing, and its quantization property effectively provides global optimization by decreasing the measure of the level sets associated with the objective function. Consequently, the proposed combinatorial optimization method allows the removal of the acceptance probability used in conventional heuristic algorithms to provide a more effective optimization. Numerical experiments show that the proposed algorithm determines the global optimum in less operational time than conventional schemes.

TI Parametric Resonance via Neuronal Microtubules: Filtering Optical
   Signals by Tryptophan Qubits
SO QUANTUM REPORTS
AB This paper aims to address the possibility of parametric resonance effects in microtubules via tryptophan qubits, using the Hamiltonian of the cavity quantum electrodynamics (QED) model involving photons in a waveguide and the surrounding environment. The time evolution equations for qubits and photons are derived using the input-output formulation. Input signals with a 560 nm wavelength are amplified by Rabi oscillations for tryptophan qubits in excited states. Here, the qubits organized in multiple layers are all in excited states. When an appropriate decay to the environment occurs as internal loss, which is prepared in multiple layers, we find binary patterns of the parametric amplification of input signals and the reduction of output signals. This property might help us to understand the information processing of optical signals by filtering them with the use of tryptophan residues in microtubules and diffused nonlocal processing spreading over the whole brain in the form of holograms.

TI Deterministically separable polarization-entangled photons from
   battery-powered diode lasers
SO NPJ QUANTUM INFORMATION
AB Large-scale integrated sources of quantum light are enabling ingredients for the future of photonic quantum technologies. For such platforms, sources based on electrical injection are of value for their turnkey operation, as they do not rely on bulky off-chip sources to achieve quantum nonlinear conversion. This work presents the first demonstration of a source of entangled photons fully contained in a single waveguide. Our source is based on a single battery-powered Bragg reflection waveguide diode laser producing two indistinguishable sources of ultra-broadband polarization-entangled photons. The output state of our device has a Bell-state fidelity of 86.3% without accidental subtraction, a high entangled pair generation rate of 1.16 x 10(6) (pairs)/(s & sdot; mW & sdot; facet), and an ultra-broadband entangled photon pair bandwidth >5.22 THz. Our approach yields scalable, compact, low-power, and stable sources of polarization-entangled photons, needed for real-world applications of quantum communications and network systems.

TI Construction of genuinely entangled multipartite subspaces from
   bipartite ones by reducing the total number of separated parties
SO PHYSICS LETTERS A
AB Construction of genuinely entangled multipartite subspaces with certain characteristics has become a relevant task in various branches of quantum information. Here we show that such subspaces can be obtained from an arbitrary collection of bipartite entangled subspaces under joining of their adjacent subsystems. In addition, it is shown that direct sums of such constructions under certain conditions are genuinely entangled. These facts are then used in detecting entanglement of tensor products of mixed states and constructing subspaces that are distillable across every bipartite cut, where for the former application we include an example with the analysis of genuine entanglement of a tripartite state obtained from two Werner states.

TI Decoherence-Induced Sudden Death of Entanglement and Bell Nonlocality
SO PHOTONICS
AB Decoherence due to the unwanted interaction between a quantum system and environment leads to the degradation of quantum coherence. In particular, for an entangled state, decoherence makes a loss of entanglement and Bell nonlocality known as entanglement sudden death (ESD), and Bell nonlocality sudden death (BNSD). Here, we theoretically investigate the entanglement and Bell nonlocality of a bipartite entangled state under three types of decoherence, amplitude damping, phase damping, and depolarizing. Our result provides the bound of decoherence strength that does not lose the entanglement and Bell nonlocality. In addition, we find two interesting features. One is that the entanglement can survive even though one of the entangled qubits is affected by a large strength of decoherence if the other qubit is affected by a small enough strength of decoherence except for the depolarizing. The second one is that when a specific form of entangled state is under amplitude damping, the Bell nonlocality shows an asymmetric behavior respect to the decoherence strengths on each qubit. Our work provides comprehensive information on ESD and BNSD for the bipartite entangled state which will be useful to implement quantum information processing in the presence of decoherence.

TI Ray-Based Framework for State Identification in Quantum Dot Devices
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB Quantum dots (QDs) defined with electrostatic gates are a leading platform for a scalable quantum computing implementation. However, with increasing numbers of qubits, the complexity of the control parameter space also grows. Traditional measurement techniques, relying on complete or near-complete exploration via two-parameter scans (images) of the device response, quickly become impractical with increasing numbers of gates. Here we propose to circumvent this challenge by introducing a measurement technique relying on one-dimensional projections of the device response in the multidimensional parameter space. Dubbed the "ray-based classification (RBC) framework," we use this machine learning approach to implement a classifier for QD states, enabling automated recognition of qubit-relevant parameter regimes. We show that RBC surpasses the 82% accuracy benchmark from the experimental implementation of image-based classification techniques from prior work, while reducing the number of measurement points needed by up to 70%. The reduction in measurement cost is a significant gain for time-intensive QD measurements and is a step forward toward the scalability of these devices. We also discuss how the RBC-based optimizer, which tunes the device to a multiqubit regime, performs when tuning in the two-dimensional and three-dimensional parameter spaces defined by plunger and barrier gates that control the QDs. This work provides experimental validation of both efficient state identification and optimization with machine learning techniques for nontraditional measurements in quantum systems with high-dimensional parameter spaces and time-intensive measurements.

TI Inherent Thermal-Noise Problem in Addressing Qubits
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB Qubit-specific measurement in a superconducting quantum processor requires physical interconnects that traverse 4 orders of magnitude in temperature from 293 K to 10 mK. Although the quantum processor can be thermalized and shielded from electromagnetic noise, the interconnects themselves introduce an unavoidable remote heat bath that causes decoherence of quantum states. In the present work, we report quantitative and device-independent measurements of the power radiated to the quantum processor from its control lines. Our results have been obtained using a calibrated bolometer that operates within a millikelvin environment with time-resolved measurement capability. In the limit of zero applied power, the noise power emitted to the quantum processor is equivalent to that of a blackbody with temperature 63-71 mK for the prototypical drive lines in the study. Experimentally, we increase the applied power of a simulated control signal to map out the resulting temperature rise and thermal time constant of five prototypical drive-line varieties. We input the data to an open quantum system model to demonstrate the trade-off between dissipated signal power, transmon-qubit lifetime, pure dephasing, gate fidelity, and the implied decoherence rates due to self-heating during microwave operations. Beyond explaining dephasing rates observed in the literature, our work sets the stage for accurate noise modeling in novel quantum computer interfacing methods due to our device-agnostic approach.

TI A Novel Hierarchical Security Solution for Controller-Area-Network-Based
   3D Printing in a Post-Quantum World
SO SENSORS
AB As the popularity of 3D printing or additive manufacturing (AM) continues to increase for use in commercial and defense supply chains, the requirement for reliable, robust protection from adversaries has become more important than ever. Three-dimensional printing security focuses on protecting both the individual Industrial Internet of Things (I-IoT) AM devices and the networks that connect hundreds of these machines together. Additionally, rapid improvements in quantum computing demonstrate a vital need for robust security in a post-quantum future for critical AM manufacturing, especially for applications in, for example, the medical and defense industries. In this paper, we discuss the attack surface of adversarial data manipulation on the physical inter-device communication bus, Controller Area Network (CAN). We propose a novel, hierarchical tree solution for a secure, post-quantum-supported security framework for CAN-based AM devices. Through using subnet hopping between isolated CAN buses, our framework maintains the ability to use legacy or third-party devices in a plug-and-play fashion while securing and minimizing the attack surface of hardware Trojans or other adversaries. The results of the physical implementation of our framework demonstrate 25% and 90% improvement in message costs for authentication compared to existing lightweight and post-quantum CAN security solutions, respectively. Additionally, we performed timing benchmarks on the normal communication (hopping) and authentication schemes of our framework.

TI Kerr nonlinear coefficient measurement of low-loss double-stripe silicon
   nitride waveguides
SO OPTICS LETTERS
AB Multi-layer Si3N4 waveguides, also known as Triplex waveguide technology, are a very promising waveguide platform for applications in microwave photonics and quantum photonics due to their low loss and compact circuit footprint. However to date, the Kerr nonlinearity of these multi-layer waveguides, in particular the asymmetric double-stripe (ADS) Si3N4 waveguides, has not been well-investigated. Here, we performed an experimental investigation of the Kerr nonlinearity of ADS Si3N4 waveguides through four-wave mixing (FWM) experiments. We obtained the nonlinear coefficient for this waveguide to be gamma(ADS) = 0.336 +/- 0.023 W(-1)m(-1). When combined with low propagation loss and absence of two-photon absorption, this moderate nonlinearity can be harnessed for chip-based nonlinear signal processing and quantum photonics.

AB The Oriented Supersingular Isogeny Diffie-Hellman is a post-quantum key exchange scheme recently introduced by Cola and Kohel. It is based on the group action of an ideal class group of a quadratic imaginary order on a subset of supersingular elliptic curves, and in this sense it can be viewed as a generalization of the popular isogeny based key exchange CSIDH. From an algorithmic standpoint, however, OSIDH is quite different from CSIDH. In a sense, OSIDH uses class groups which are more structured than in CSIDH, creating a potential weakness that was already recognized by Cola and Kohel. To circumvent the weakness, they proposed an ingenious way to realize a key exchange by exchanging partial information on how the class group acts in the neighborhood of the public curves, and conjectured that this additional information would not impact security.
   In this work we revisit the security of OSIDH by presenting a new attack, building upon previous work of Onuki. Our attack has exponential complexity, but it practically breaks Cola and Kohel's parameters unlike Onuki's attack. We also discuss countermeasures to our attack, and analyze their impact on OSIDH, both from an efficiency and a functionality point of view.

TI A Computable Gaussian Quantum Correlation for Continuous-Variable
   Systems
SO ENTROPY
AB Generally speaking, it is difficult to compute the values of the Gaussian quantum discord and Gaussian geometric discord for Gaussian states, which limits their application. In the present paper, for any (n + m)-mode continuous-variable system, a computable Gaussian quantum correlation M is proposed. For any state rho(AB) of the system, M(rho(AB)) depends only on the covariant matrix of p AB without any measurements performed on a subsystem or any optimization procedures, and thus is easily computed. Furthermore, M has the following attractive properties: (1) M is independent of the mean of states, is symmetric about the subsystems and has no ancilla problem; (2) M is locally Gaussian unitary invariant; (3) for a Gaussian state rho(AB), M (rho(AB)) = 0 if and only if rho(AB) is a product state; and (4) 0 <= M ( (Phi(A) circle times Phi(B))rho(AB)) <= M (rho(AB)) holds for any Gaussian state rho(AB) and any Gaussian channels Phi(A) and Phi(B) performed on the subsystem A and B, respectively. Therefore, M is a nice Gaussian correlation which describes the same Gaussian correlation as Gaussian quantum discord and Gaussian geometric discord when restricted on Gaussian states. As an application of M, a noninvasive quantum method for detecting intracellular temperature is proposed.

TI Perspective-On the thermodynamics of perfect unconditional security
SO APPLIED PHYSICS LETTERS
AB A secure key distribution (exchange) scheme is unconditionally secure if it is unbreakable against arbitrary technological improvements of computing power and/or any development of new algorithms. There are only two families of experimentally realized and tested unconditionally secure key distribution technologies: quantum key distribution (QKD), the base of quantum cryptography, which utilizes quantum physical photonic features, and the Kirchhoff-Law-Johnson-Noise (KLJN) system that is based on classical statistical physics (fluctuation-dissipation theorem). The focus topic of this paper is the thermodynamical situation of the KLJN system. In all the original works, the proposed KLJN schemes required thermal equilibrium between the devices of the communicating parties to achieve perfect security. However, Vadai et al., in (Nature) Sci. Rep. 5, 13653 (2015) show a modified scheme, where there is a non-zero thermal noise energy flow between the parties, yet the system seems to resist all the known attack types. We introduce an attack type against their system. The attack utilizes coincidence events between the line current and voltages. We show that there is a non-zero information leak toward the Eavesdropper, even under idealized conditions. As soon as the thermal equilibrium is restored, the system becomes perfectly secure again. In conclusion, perfect unconditional security requires thermal equilibrium.

AB In today's digital landscape, cryptography plays a vital role in ensuring communication security through encryption and authentication algorithms. While traditional cryptographic methods rely on hard mathematical problems for security, the rise of quantum computing threatens their effectiveness. Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC) algorithms, like CRYSTALS-Kyber, aim to withstand quantum attacks. Recently standardized, CRYSTALS-Kyber is a lattice-based algorithm designed to resist quantum attacks. However, its implementation faces computational challenges, particularly with Keccak-based functions, which are crucial for security and upon which the FIPS 202 standard is based. Our paper addresses this technological challenge by designing a FIPS 202 hardware accelerator to enhance CRYSTALS-Kyber efficiency and security. We chose to implement the entire FIPS 202 standard in hardware in order to widen the applicability of the accelerator to all possible algorithms that rely on such hash functions, taking care to provide realistic assumptions on system-level integration inside a System-on-Chip (SoC). We provide results in terms of area, frequency, and clock cycles for both ASIC and FPGA targets. An area reduction of up to 22.3% is achieved with respect to state-of-the-art solutions. In addition, we integrated the accelerator inside a 32-bit RISC-V based security-oriented SoC, where we show a strong performance gain on CRYSTALS-Kyber execution. The design presented in this paper performs better in all Kyber1024 primitives, with an improvement up to 3.21x in Kyber-KeyGen.

TI Deep Neural Network Based Reconciliation for CV-QKD
SO PHOTONICS
AB High-speed reconciliation is indispensable for supporting the continuous-variable quantum key distribution (CV-QKD) system to generate the secure key in real-time. However, the error correction process's high complexity and low processing speed limit the reconciliation speed. Therefore, reconciliation has also become the bottleneck of system performance. In this paper, we proposed a high-speed reconciliation scheme that uses the deep neural network to optimize the decoding process of the low-density parity-check (LDPC) code. We first introduced a network structure of decoding implementation based on the deep neural network, which can be applied to decoding algorithms of parallel strategy and significantly reduce the decoding complexity. Subsequently, we proposed two improved decoding algorithms based on this structure, named linear fitting algorithm and deep neural network-assisted decoding algorithm. Finally, we introduced a high-speed reconciliation scheme based on the CPU-GPU hybrid platform. Simulation results show that the proposed reconciliation scheme reduces the complexity and enables us to realize the high-speed CV-QKD system. Furthermore, the improved decoding algorithm can also reduce the FER, thereby increasing the secret key rate.

AB As edge cloud environments become increasingly complex, efficient service management requires advanced orchestration strategies that can handle diverse and dynamic network conditions. In this paper, we present a novel quantum-based orchestration framework that leverages quantum search algorithm (Grover in particular) to optimize the management of services within the edge cloud continuum. We present a multi-objective optimization model that considers critical factors such as latency, bandwidth, reliability, and error minimization, and formulate the problem mathematically to capture the complexity of modern network environments. Through both analytical comparisons and simulation results, we show that the Grover algorithm can offer computational advantages over classical search methods, especially in scenarios on cases when the parameter space is very large. Our results include a detailed analysis of theoretical computational complexity, an estimate of execution times, and the identification of crossover points where quantum methods outperform traditional approaches. Finally, we provide insight into the challenges and future directions of integrating quantum computing into network management frameworks, setting the stage for further progress in this area.

TI The Feasibility of the CRYSTALS-Kyber Scheme for Smart Metering Systems

AB This paper investigates the feasibility of a quantum-secure Key Encapsulation Mechanism (KEM) in hardware constrained Smart Meter (SM) equipment. In this sense, the Cryptographic Suite for Algebraic Lattices (CRYSTALS)-Kyber scheme, the new standard for post-quantum Public-Key Encryption (PKE) systems chosen by the post-quantum cryptography (PQC) standardization process, is scrutinized and implemented in a System-on-a-Chip (SoC) Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) device. Experimental results show that the proposed hardware/software co-design implementation of the CRYSTALS-Kyber scheme in an SoC FPGA device reduces its execution time by around 70% compared to its software implementation. Moreover, the hardware resource analysis shows that the proposed hardware/software co-design implementation of the CRYSTALS-Kyber scheme in an SoC device is feasible for SM equipment.

AB Ad hoc routing protocols, widely used in mesh networks, lack inherent control plane security, making them vulnerable to classical attacks and future quantum threats. We present a security enhancement for the Optimized Link State Routing Protocol (OLSR) integrating post-quantum cryptography. Our approach embeds a Kyber512 key-encapsulation handshake within neighbor discovery (HELLO messages) to establish secure sessions. Subsequent HELLO and Topology Control (TC) messages are protected using ChaCha20-Poly1305 authenticated encryption (AEAD). This ensures neighbor authenticity, message confidentiality, and integrity against both classical and quantum adversaries without altering core OLSR routing logic. We detail the mechanism, including TLV-based packet extensions and cryptographic state management, using standard libraries (liboqs, OpenSSL). This provides a practical pathway towards quantum-resilient mesh networking, with performance evaluated through parameters like handshake latency and control plane overhead. Future work can explore protocol-agnostic abstractions.

TI Smart Grid, Demand Response and Optimization: A Critical Review of
   Computational Methods
SO ENERGIES
AB In view of scarcity of traditional energy resources and environmental issues, renewable energy resources (RERs) are introduced to fulfill the electricity requirement of growing world. Moreover, the effective utilization of RERs to fulfill the varying electricity demands of customers can be achieved via demand response (DR). Furthermore, control techniques, decision variables and offered motivations are the ways to introduce DR into distribution network (DN). This categorization needs to be optimized to balance the supply and demand in DN. Therefore, intelligent algorithms are employed to achieve optimized DR. However, these algorithms are computationally restrained to handle the parametric load of uncertainty involved with RERs and power system. Henceforth, this paper focuses on the limitations of intelligent algorithms for DR. Furthermore, a comparative study of different intelligent algorithms for DR is discussed. Based on conclusions, quantum algorithms are recommended to optimize the computational burden for DR in future smart grid.

TI Fermion Sampling: A Robust Quantum Computational Advantage Scheme Using
   Fermionic Linear Optics and Magic Input States
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB Fermionic linear optics (FLO) is a restricted model of quantum computation, which in its original form is known to be efficiently classically simulable. We show that, when initialized with suitable input states, FLO circuits can be used to demonstrate quantum computational advantage with strong hardness guarantees. Based on this, we propose a quantum advantage scheme, which is a fermionic analog of boson sampling: fermion sampling with magic input states. We consider in parallel two classes of circuits: particle-number conserving (passive) FLO and active FLO that preserves only fermionic parity. Using low-dimensional continuous symmetry groups that underpin these classes of quantum circuits, we prove anticoncentration and robust average-case hardness of computation of output probabilities probabilities. Taken together, these findings provide hardness guarantees comparable to the paradigm of random circuit sampling and boson sampling, the leading candidates for attaining quantum computational advantage. Our scheme is experimentally feasible. FLO circuits are relevant for quantum chemistry and many-body physics, and have been successfully implemented in superconducting architectures. We also argue that due to the structured nature of FLO circuits, they can be efficiently certified using resources scaling polynomially with the system size, with partial trust in the quantum device.

TI Bolometric Superconducting Optical Nanoscopy (BOSON)
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW X
AB Superconducting transition-edge sensors are renowned for their extraordinary photon sensitivity and energy resolution, finding applications spanning quantum information, astronomy, and nanophotonics. Here, we report the development of bolometric superconducting optical nanoscopy (BOSON), a novel platform that integrates bolometric detection at the superconducting transition edges with near-field optical techniques. BOSON enables the mapping of photoinduced changes in superconductivity with unprecedented spatial resolution and photon sensitivity. By incorporating BOSON with low-dimensional materials, we achieved polariton imaging at nanowatt excitation levels-at least 4 orders of magnitude lower than the power typically required in prior near-field nanoscopy experiments. Our findings highlight the potential for BOSON to advance scanning-probe-based optical platforms to enable the detection of photons, polaritons, and Cooper pair dynamics at the nanoscale. This paves the way for quantum sensing applications using single-polariton detection and can offer deeper insights into quasiparticle dynamics.

TI Unambiguous discrimination of general quantum operations
SO SCIENCE ADVANCES
AB The discrimination of quantum operations has long been an intriguing challenge, with theoretical research notably advancing our understanding of the quantum features in discriminating quantum objects. This challenge is closely related to the discrimination of quantum states, and proof-of-principle demonstrations of the latter have already been realized using optical photons. However, the experimental demonstration of discriminating general quantum operations, including both unitary and nonunitary operations, has remained elusive. In general quantum systems, especially those with high dimensions, the preparation of arbitrary quantum states and the implementation of arbitrary quantum operations and generalized measurements are nontrivial tasks. Here, we experimentally demonstrate the optimal unambiguous discrimination of up to six displacement operators and the unambiguous discrimination of nonunitary quantum operations. Our results demonstrate powerful tools for experimental research in quantum information processing and are expected to stimulate a wide range of valuable applications in the field of quantum sensing.

TI Hyper-optimized tensor network contraction
SO QUANTUM
AB Tensor networks represent the state-of-the-art in computational methods across many disciplines, including the classical simulation of quantum many-body systems and quantum circuits. Several applications of current interest give rise to tensor networks with irregular geometries. Finding the best possible contraction path for such networks is a central problem, with an exponential effect on computation time and memory footprint. In this work, we implement new randomized protocols that find very high quality contraction paths for arbitrary and large tensor networks. We test our methods on a variety of benchmarks, including the random quantum circuit instances recently implemented on Google quantum chips. We find that the paths obtained can be very close to optimal, and often many orders or magnitude better than the most established approaches. As different underlying geometries suit different methods, we also introduce a hyper-optimization approach, where both the method applied and its algorithmic parameters are tuned during the path finding. The increase in quality of contraction schemes found has significant practical implications for the simulation of quantum many-body systems and particularly for the benchmarking of new quantum chips. Concretely, we estimate a speed-up of over 10,000x compared to the original expectation for the classical simulation of the Sycamore 'supremacy' circuits.

TI Practical Quantum Circuit Implementation for Simulating Coupled
   Classical Oscillators
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB Simulating large-scale coupled-oscillator systems presents substantial computational challenges for classical algorithms, particularly when pursuing first-principles analyses in the thermodynamic limit. Motivated by the quantum algorithm framework proposed by Babbush et al. (2023), we present and implement a detailed quantum circuit construction for simulating one-dimensional spring-mass systems. Our approach incorporates key quantum subroutines, including block encoding, quantum singular value transformation (QSVT), and amplitude amplification, to realize the unitary time-evolution operator associated with simulating classical oscillators dynamics. In the uniform mass-spring setting, our circuit construction requires a gate complexity of O(log(2)(2)Nlog(2)(1/epsilon)) , where N is the number of oscillators and epsilon is the target accuracy of the approximation. For more general, heterogeneous mass-spring systems, the total gate complexity is O(Nlog(2)Nlog(2)(1/epsilon)) . Both settings require O(log(2)N) qubits. Numerical simulations agree with classical solvers across all tested configurations, indicating that this circuit-based Hamiltonian simulation approach can substantially reduce computational costs and potentially enable larger-scale many-body studies on future quantum hardware.

TI Optimizing HAWK Signature Scheme Performance on ARMv8

AB This study proposes an optimized implementation of the HAWK Signature algorithm, one of the candidates in the first evaluation round for additional digital signature schemes in the NIST Post-Quantum Cryptography competition. The core motivation of this research is to improve the performance of HAWK algorithm. By conducting profiling analysis to identify, we identified the most resource-intensive functions. And then we optimized the functions. The optimization techniques through profiling analysis are not limited to HAWK but can be applied to other algorithms as well. Additionally, the study demonstrates how efficient optimization can be achieved using fewer instructions by leveraging lesser-known ARMv8 instructions. By targeting the functions with the highest overhead and utilizing fewer instructions, a performance improvement of approximately 2.5% for Hawk512 and 4% for Hawk1024 was achieved, respectively. These results confirm that combining profiling analysis with efficient instruction usage can lead to significant performance improvements.

TI Markov-chain Monte Carlo method enhanced by a quantum alternating
   operator ansatz
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Quantum computation is expected to accelerate certain computational tasks over classical counterparts. Its most primitive advantage is its ability to sample from classically intractable probability distributions. A promising approach to make use of this fact is the so-called quantum-enhanced Markov-chain Monte Carlo (qe-MCMC) method [D. Layden et al., Nature (London) 619, 282 (2023)], which uses outputs from quantum circuits as the proposal distributions. In this paper, we propose the use of a quantum alternating operator ansatz (QAOA) for qe-MCMC and provide a strategy to optimize its parameters to improve convergence speed while keeping its depth shallow. The proposed QAOA-type circuit is designed to satisfy the specific constraint which qe-MCMC requires with arbitrary parameters. Through our extensive numerical analysis, we find a correlation in a certain parameter range between an experimentally measurable value, acceptance rate of MCMC, and the spectral gap of the MCMC transition matrix, which determines the convergence speed. This allows us to optimize the parameter in the QAOA circuit and achieve quadratic speedup in convergence. Since MCMC is used in various areas such as statistical physics and machine learning, this paper represents an important step toward realizing practical quantum advantage with currently available quantum computers through qe-MCMC.

SO MATERIALS
AB Single-photon sources (SPSs) play a crucial role in quantum photonics, and colloidal quantum dots (CQDs) have emerged as promising and cost-effective candidates for such applications due to their high-purity single-photon emission at room temperature. This review focuses on various aspects of CQDs as SPSs. Firstly, a brief overview of the fundamental optical properties of CQDs is provided, including emission wavelength engineering and fluorescence intermittency, and their single-photon emission properties. Subsequently, this review delves into research concerning CQDs as SPSs, covering topics such as the coupling of single CQDs to microcavities, both in weak and strong coupling regimes.

TI A Novel Approach to Bit-Flipping Threshold Selection with Particle Swarm
   Optimization in the QC-MDPC-McEliece Cryptosystem
SO JOURNAL OF INFORMATION ASSURANCE AND SECURITY
AB The advent of quantum computers brings about the need for cryptosystems that can withstand quantum attacks. The QC-MDPC based McEliece cryptosystem is one such post-quantum cryptographic scheme, offering robust security yet posing significant challenges in efficient decoding. Central to these challenges is the selection of an optimal threshold for bit-flipping decoding algorithms. This paper presents a novel approach that applies Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) to dynamically establish optimal thresholds, thereby aiming to minimize the number of iterations needed for successful decoding. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method through rigorous simulations, underscoring its potential to enhance the efficiency of the McEliece cryptosystem and comparable post-quantum cryptographic schemes. This research could mark a substantial step towards greater practicality in the realm of post-quantum cryptography.

AB We study semantic security for classical-quantum channels. Our security functions are functional forms of mosaics of combinatorial designs. We extend methods in [25] from classical channels to classical-quantum channels to demonstrate that mosaics of designs ensure semantic security for classical-quantum channels, and are also capacity achieving coding schemes. An advantage of these modular wiretap codes is that we provide explicit code constructions that can be implemented in practice for every channel, given an arbitrary public code.

TI Excited-state spin-resonance spectroscopy of VB-
   defect centers in hexagonal boron nitride
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB The recently discovered spin-active boron vacancy (V-B(-)) defect center in hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) has high contrast optically-detected magnetic resonance (ODMR) at room-temperature, with a spin-triplet ground-state that shows promise as a quantum sensor. Here we report temperature-dependent ODMR spectroscopy to probe spin within the orbital excited-state. Our experiments determine the excited-state spin Hamiltonian, including a room-temperature zero-field splitting of 2.1 GHz and a g-factor similar to that of the ground-state. We confirm that the resonance is associated with spin rotation in the excited-state using pulsed ODMR measurements, and we observe Zeeman-mediated level anti-crossings in both the orbital ground- and excited-state. Our observation of a single set of excited-state spin-triplet resonance from 10 to 300 K is suggestive of symmetry-lowering of the defect system from D-3h to C-2v. Additionally, the excited-state ODMR has strong temperature dependence of both contrast and transverse anisotropy splitting, enabling promising avenues for quantum sensing.

TI Non-Boolean quantum amplitude amplification and quantum mean estimation
SO QUANTUM INFORMATION PROCESSING
AB This paper generalizes the quantum amplitude amplification and amplitude estimation algorithms to work with non-Boolean oracles. The action of a non-Boolean oracle U-phi on an eigenstate |x > is to apply a state-dependent phase-shift phi(x). Unlike Boolean oracles, the eigenvalues exp(i phi( x)) of a non-Boolean oracle are not restricted to be +/- 1. Two new oracular algorithms based on such non-Boolean oracles are introduced. The first is the non-Boolean amplitude amplification algorithm, which preferentially amplifies the amplitudes of the eigenstates based on the value of phi(x). Starting from a given initial superposition state |psi 0 >, the basis states with lower values of cos(phi) are amplified at the expense of the basis states with higher values of cos(phi). The second algorithm is the quantum mean estimation algorithm, which uses quantum phase estimation to estimate the expectation <psi(0)|U-phi|psi(0)>, i.e., the expected value of exp(i psi(x)) for a random x sampled by making a measurement on |psi(0)>. It is shown that the quantum mean estimation algorithm offers a quadratic speedup over the corresponding classical algorithm. Both algorithms are demonstrated using simulations for a toy example. Potential applications of the algorithms are briefly discussed.

TI Optimal control-based quantum genetic algorithm for a six jointed
   articulated robotic arm
SO RESULTS IN CONTROL AND OPTIMIZATION
AB This paper explores the use of a quantum genetic algorithm (QGA) for finding the best control considering a calculated path for a six-jointed robotic arm. Classical genetic algorithms (GAs) are typically used to solve optimization problems in robot manipulators, however, QGAs bring a consistent advantage in terms of solution quality. In fact, this study uses a QGA simulated on classical hardware to create optimal control law based on a fifth-order polynomial path, aiming to minimize the tracking error of the position. Eventually, it compares positional error and energy consumption used by actuators through its cost function with to the classical methods. The simulation demonstrates that the QGA tends to be better than real-coded and binary-coded genetic algorithms (respectively RCGA and BCGA), especially when it comes to tracking accuracy, energy, and maintaining stability in noisy conditions. This indicates its potential use in real-time robotics applications by exploring quantum algorithms' practical benefits over traditional optimization methods for complex tasks with multiple dimensions in robot systems control.

TI Counterdiabatic optimized driving in quantum phase sensitive models
SO NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB State preparation plays a pivotal role in numerous quantum algorithms, including quantum phase estimation. This paper extends and benchmarks counterdiabatic driving protocols across three one-dimensional spin systems characterized by phase transitions: the axial next-nearest neighbor Ising, XXZ, and Haldane-Shastry models. We perform a shallow quantum optimal control over the counterdiabatic protocols by optimizing an energy cost function. Moreover, we provide a code package for computing symbolically various adiabatic gauge potentials. This protocol consistently surpasses standard annealing schedules, often achieving performance improvements of several orders of magnitude. The axial next-nearest neighbor Ising model stands out as a notable example, where fidelities exceeding 0.5 are attainable in most cases. Furthermore, the optimized paths exhibit promising generalization capabilities to higher-dimensional systems, allowing for the extension of parameters from smaller models. Nevertheless, our investigations reveal limitations in the case of the XXZ and Haldane-Shastry models, particularly when transitioning away from the ferromagnetic phase. This suggests that finding optimal diabatic gauge potentials for specific systems remains an important research direction.

TI Series and Rational Solutions of the Second Kind Painlevé Equations by
   Using the Quantum Pseudospectral Method
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICS AND MATHEMATICAL SCIENCES
AB The Painlev & eacute; equations and their series and rational solutions are essential in applied, pure mathematics and theoretical physics. Recently, quantum algorithms have helped to implement numerical algorithms more easily by performing linear algebra in our working. This article uses a hybrid of quantum computing schemes and spectral methods for the second Painlev & eacute; equation. Two approaches are investigated: first, a series solution is obtained, and then the rational solutions. The successive linearization method is used for the linearization of the Painlev & eacute;-II equation. In the computer implementation, the solution value of the Painlev & eacute;-II equation is considered as a final quantum state. In each iterative scheme, by adding the current quantum state, we can compute the final quantum state. We need different quantum models for each approach, series, and rational solutions. Numerical examples illustrate the efficiency of this method, and reasonable solutions are obtained for a wide range of parameter values.

TI Thermodynamic Principle for Quantum Metrology
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB The heat dissipation in quantum metrology represents not only an unavoidable problem towards practical applications of quantum sensing devices but also a fundamental relationship between thermodynamics and quantum metrology. However, a general thermodynamic principle which governs the rule of energy consumption in quantum metrology, similar to Landauer???s principle for heat dissipation in computations, has remained elusive. Here, we establish such a physical principle for energy consumption in order to achieve a certain level of measurement precision in quantum metrology, and show that it is intrinsically determined by the erasure of quantum Fisher information. The principle provides a powerful tool to investigate the advantage of quantum resources, not only in measurement precision but also in energy efficiency. It also serves as a bridge between thermodynamics and various fundamental physical concepts related in quantum physics and quantum information theory.

TI Fast-forwarding molecular ground state preparation with optimal control
   on analog quantum simulators
SO JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL PHYSICS
AB We show that optimal control of the electron dynamics is able to prepare molecular ground states, within chemical accuracy, with evolution times approaching the bounds imposed by quantum mechanics. We propose a specific parameterization of the molecular evolution only in terms of interaction already present in the molecular Hamiltonian. Thus, the proposed method solely utilizes quantum simulation routines, retaining their favorable scalings. Due to the intimate relationships between variational quantum algorithms and optimal control, we compare, when possible, our results with state-of-the-art methods in the literature. We found that the number of parameters needed to reach chemical accuracy and algorithmic scaling is in line with compact adaptive strategies to build variational Ansatze. The algorithm, which is also suitable for quantum simulators, is implemented by emulating a digital quantum processor (up to 16 qubits) and tested on different molecules and geometries spanning different degrees of electron correlation.

TI Optimal Toffoli-Depth Quantum Adder
SO ACM TRANSACTIONS ON QUANTUM COMPUTING
AB Efficient quantum arithmetic circuits are commonly found in numerous quantum algorithms of practical significance. To date, the logarithmic-depth quantum adders include a constant coefficient k >= 2 while achieving the Toffoli-Depth of k log n + O(1). In this work, 160 alternative compositions of the carry-propagation structure are comprehensively explored to determine the optimal depth structure for a quantum adder. By extensively studying these structures, it is shown that an exact Toffoli-Depth of logn + O(1) is achievable. This presents a reduction of Toffoli-Depth by almost 50% compared to the best known quantum adder circuits presented to date. We demonstrate a further possible design by incorporating a different expansion of propagate and generate forms, as well as an extension of the modular framework. Our article elaborates on these designs, supported by detailed theoretical analyses and simulation-based studies, firmly substantiating our claims of optimality within all possible configurations outlined in this work. The results also mirror similar improvements, recently reported in classical adder circuit complexity.

TI Transporting Cold Atoms towards a GaN-on-Sapphire Chip via an Optical
   Conveyor Belt
SO CHINESE PHYSICS LETTERS
AB Trapped atoms on photonic structures inspire many novel quantum devices for quantum information processing and quantum sensing. Here, we demonstrate a hybrid photonic-atom chip platform based on a GaN-on-sapphire chip and the transport of an ensemble of atoms from free space towards the chip with an optical conveyor belts. Due to our platform's complete optical accessibility and careful control of atomic motion near the chip with a conveyor belt, successful atomic transport towards the chip is made possible. The maximum transport efficiency of atoms is about 50% with a transport distance of 500 mu m. Our results open up a new route toward the efficient loading of cold atoms into the evanescent-field trap formed by the photonic integrated circuits, which promises strong and controllable interactions between single atoms and single photons.

Several MinRank-based digital signature schemes have been proposed. In particular, two of them, MIRA and MiRitH, have been submitted to the NIST post-quantum cryptography standardization process. In this article, we propose a key-generation algorithm for MinRank-based schemes that reduces the size of the public key to about 50% of the size of the public key generated by the previous best (in terms of public-key size) algorithm. Precisely, the size of the public key generated by our algorithm sits in the range of 328-676 bits for security levels of 128-256 bits. We also prove that our algorithm is as secure as the previous ones.

TI Junction-free microwave two-mode radiation from a kinetic inductance

AB Parametric down-conversion is a widely exploited technique in optics to produce entangled states of photons for quantum information processing and quantum sensing. In the microwave domain, devices based on Josephson junctions, such as Josephson parametric amplifiers and voltage-biased Josephson junctions, have been successfully utilized to generate such states. However, their high susceptibility to magnetic fields has posed challenges in many applications. Here we demonstrate the generation of two-mode squeezed states via four-wave mixing in a superconducting nanowire resonator patterned from NbN. The NbN nanowire exhibits a strong Kerr nonlinearity, resulting in the emission of a signal-idler pair with a cross-correlation of g(2)(0)=11.9. Owing to the magnetic resilience and high critical temperature (Tc) of NbN, our microwave parametric sources based on kinetic inductance promise an expanded range of potential applications

TI Device-Independent Quantum Secure Direct Communication with
   Single-Photon
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW APPLIED
AB Quantum secure direct communication (QSDC) can directly transmit secrete messages through a quantum channel. Device-independent (DI) QSDC can guarantee the communication security relying only on the observation of the Bell-inequality violation, but not on any detailed description or trust of the inner workings of users' devices. In the paper, we propose a DI-QSDC protocol with practical highly efficient single-photon sources. The communication parties construct the entanglement channel from single photons by adopting the heralded architecture, which makes the message-leakage rate independent of the photon-transmission loss. The secure communication distance and the practical communication efficiency of the current DI-QSDC protocol are about 6 times and 600 times of those in the original DI-QSDC protocol. Combining with the entanglement purification, the parties can construct the nearly perfect entanglement channel and completely eliminate the message leakage. This DI-QSDC protocol may have useful applications in the future quantum communication field.

AB Physical Unclonable Functions (PUFs) are hardware devices with the assumption of possessing inherent, non-clonable physical randomness which leads to unique pairs of inputs and outputs that provide a secure fingerprint for cryptographic protocols like Authentication. In the case of quantum PUFs (QPUFs), the input-output pairs consists of quantum states instead of classical bitstrings, offering advantages over classical PUFs (CPUFs) such as challenge reusability via public channels and non-reliance over any trusted party due to the no-cloning theorem. In recent literature, a generalized mathematical framework for studying QPUFs was developed, which paved the way for having QPUF models with provable security. It was proved that existential unforgeability against Quantum Polynomial Time (QPT) adversaries cannot be achieved by any random unitary QPUF. Since measurements are non-unitary quantum processes, we define a QPUF based on random von Neumann measurements. We prove that such a QPUF is existentially unforgeable. Thus, we introduce the first model in existing literature that depicts such a high level of provable security. We also prove that the Quantum Phase Estimation (QPE) protocol applied on a Haar random unitary serves as an approximate implementation for this kind of QPUF as it approximates a von Neumann measurement on the eigenbasis of the unitary.

TI Single-shot readout of the nuclear spin of an on-surface atom
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Nuclear spins owe their long-lived magnetic states to their excellent isolation from the environment. At the same time, a finite degree of interaction with their surroundings is necessary for reading and writing the spin state. Therefore, detailed knowledge of and control over the atomic environment of a nuclear spin is key to optimizing conditions for quantum information applications. While various platforms enabled single-shot readout of nuclear spins, their direct environments were either unknown or impossible to controllably modify on the atomic scale. Scanning tunneling microscopy (STM), combined with electron spin resonance (ESR), provides atomic-scale information of individual nuclear spins via the hyperfine interaction. Here, we demonstrate single-shot readout of an individual 49Ti nuclear spin with an STM. Employing a pulsed measurement scheme, we find its lifetime to be in the order of seconds. Furthermore, we shed light on the pumping and relaxation mechanisms of the nuclear spin by investigating its response to both ESR driving and tunneling current, which is supported by model calculations. These findings give an atomic-scale insight into the nature of nuclear spin relaxation and are relevant for the development of atomically assembled qubit platforms.

For these problems, the classical dynamic programming complexity in O-& lowast;(c(n)), where O-& lowast; denotes that polynomial factors are ignored, can be reduced by a hybrid algorithm to O-& lowast;(c(quant)(n)), with c(quant)<c. In this paper, we provide a bounded-error hybrid algorithm that achieves such an improvement for a broad class of NP-hard single-machine scheduling problems for which we give a generic description. Moreover, we extend this algorithm to tackle the 3-machine flowshop problem. Our algorithm reduces the exponential-part complexity compared to the best-known classical algorithm, sometimes at the cost of an additional pseudo-polynomial factor.

TI Models of Quantum Complexity Growth
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB The concept of quantum complexity has far-reaching implications spanning theoretical computer science, quantum many-body physics, and high-energy physics. The quantum complexity of a unitary transformation or quantum state is defined as the size of the shortest quantum computation that executes the unitary or prepares the state. It is reasonable to expect that the complexity of a quantum state governed by a chaotic many-body Hamiltonian grows linearly with time for a time that is exponential in the system size; however, because it is hard to rule out a shortcut that improves the efficiency of a computation, it is notoriously difficult to derive lower bounds on quantum complexity for particular unitaries or states without making additional assumptions. To go further, one may study more generic models of complexity growth. We provide a rigorous connection between complexity growth and unitary k-designs, ensembles that capture the randomness of the unitary group. This connection allows us to leverage existing results about design growth to draw conclusions about the growth of complexity. We prove that local random quantum circuits generate unitary transformations whose complexity grows linearly for a long time, mirroring the behavior one expects in chaotic quantum systems and verifying conjectures by Brown and Susskind. Moreover, our results apply under a strong definition of quantum complexity based on optimal distinguishing measurements.

TI Phase-state duality in reversible circuit design
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB The reversible implementation of classical functions accounts for the bulk of most known quantum algorithms. As a result, a number of reversible circuit constructions over the Clifford+T gate set have been developed in recent years which use both the state and phase spaces, or X and Z bases, to reduce circuit costs beyond what is possible at the strictly classical level. We study and generalize two particular classes of these constructions: relative-phase circuits, including Giles and Selinger's multiply controlled iX gates and Maslov's four-qubit Toffoli gate, and measurement-assisted circuits, including Jones' Toffoli gate and Gidney's temporary logical-AND gate. In doing so, we introduce general methods for implementing classical functions up to phase and for measurement-assisted termination of temporary values. We then apply these techniques to find T-count efficient constructions of some classical functions in space-constrained regimes, notably multiply controlled Toffoli gates and temporary products.

TI Determination of the current-phase relation of an InAs 2DEG Josephson
   junction with a microwave resonator
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Semiconductor-superconductor hybrid nanocircuits are of high interest because of their potential applications in quantum computing. Semiconductors with strong spin-orbit coupling and large g factor are particularly attractive since they are the basic building blocks of novel qubit architectures. However, for the engineering of these complex circuits, the building blocks must be characterized in detail. We have investigated a Josephson junction where the weak link is a two-dimensional electron gas (2DEG) hosted in an InAs/InGaAs heterostructure grown on a GaAs substrate. We employed the in situ epitaxially grown Al layer as a superconducting contact to form an rf SQUID, and also to create a microwave resonator for sensing the Josephson inductance. We determined the gate-dependent current-phase relation and observed supercurrent interference in out-of-plane magnetic fields. With the application of an in-plane magnetic field, we induced asymmetry in the interference pattern, which was found to be anisotropic in the device plane.

TI Synthesizing efficient circuits for Hamiltonian simulation
SO NPJ QUANTUM INFORMATION
AB We provide an approach for compiling quantum simulation circuits that appear in Trotter, qDRIFT and multi-product formulas to Clifford and non-Clifford operations that can reduce the number of non-Clifford operations. The total number of gates, especially CNOT, reduce in many cases. We show that it is possible to implement an exponentiated sum of commuting Paulis with at most m (controlled)-rotation gates, where m is the number of distinct non-zero eigenvalues (ignoring sign). Thus we can collect mutually commuting Hamiltonian terms into groups satisfying one of several symmetries identified in this work. This allows an inexpensive simulation of the entire group of terms. We further show that the cost can in some cases be reduced by partially allocating Hamiltonian terms to several groups and provide a polynomial time classical algorithm that can greedily allocate the terms to appropriate groupings.

TI A fast method for finding separable Goppa polynomials used in
   post-quantum McEliece-based cryptography
SO EURASIP JOURNAL ON INFORMATION SECURITY
AB This paper introduces a simple and efficient method for generating Goppa polynomials used in post-quantum cryptography based on any variant of the McEliece algorithm. The approach demonstrates that such polynomials can be constructed more rapidly by multiplying several low-degree polynomials that satisfy specific properties. It is also proven that employing these polynomials does not compromise the code's error-correcting capability or overall security. The proposed method is especially advantageous when high-order Goppa polynomials are required. As a proof of concept, we present an application for user identification that combines cryptography and iris biometrics. In this system, encrypted versions of iris templates are securely stored. Using the homomorphic property of McEliece, recognition can be performed within the encrypted domain, ensuring that biometric data remains confidential throughout the entire process.

TI Exploring Cryptographic Key Management Schemes for Enhanced Security in
   WSNs
SO JOURNAL OF INFORMATION ASSURANCE AND SECURITY
AB Securing wireless sensor networks (WSNs) is challenging due to the resource constraints of SNs, including limited computational power, memory, and energy capacity. Cryptographic key management is central to ensuring data confidentiality, integrity, and authenticity in WSNs. This paper explores key management schemes categorized by their design principles, including symmetric, asymmetric, hybrid, and hierarchical approaches. The strengths, limitations, and ideal use cases of these schemes are analyzed to identify their suitability for various applications. The study also addresses critical challenges such as energy efficiency, scalability, resilience to node capture, and the emerging need for post-quantum cryptography in securing future networks. The findings aim to guide the development of optimized key management solutions tailored to the evolving requirements of WSNs, ensuring robust security and operational efficiency.

TI Phase Space Insights: Wigner Functions for Qubits and Beyond
SO APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL
AB Phase space methods, particularly Wigner functions, provide intuitive tools for representing and analyzing quantum states. We focus on systems with SU(2) dynamical symmetry, which naturally describes spin and a wide range of two-mode quantum models. We present a unified phase space framework tailored to these systems, highlighting its broad applicability in quantum optics, metrology, and information. After reviewing the core SU(2) phase-space formalism, we apply it to states designed for optimal quantum sensing, where their nonclassical features are clearly revealed in the Wigner representation. We then extend the approach to systems with an indefinite number of excitations, introducing a generalized framework that captures correlations across multiple SU(2)-invariant subspaces. These results offer practical tools for understanding both theoretical and experimental developments in quantum science.

TI A degressive quantum convolutional neuralnetwork for quantum state
   classificationand code recognition
SO ISCIENCE
AB With the rapid development of quantum computing, a variety of quantum convolutional neural networks(QCNNs) are proposed. However, only1=2n2features of ann-qubits input are transferred to the next layerin a quantum pooling layer, which results in the accuracy reduction. To solve this problem, a QCNN with adegressive circuit is proposed. In order to enhance the ability of extracting global features, we remove theparameters sharing strategy in the quantum convolutional layer and design a quantum convolutionalkernel with global eyesight. In addition, to prevent a sharp feature reduction, a degressive parameterizedquantum circuit is adopted to construct the pooling layer. Then theZ-basis measurement is only per-formed on the first qubit to control the operations on other qubits. Compared with the state-of-the-artQCNN, i.e., hybrid quantum-classical convolutional neural network, the accuracy of our model increasedby 0.9%, 1%, and 3%, respectively, in three tasks: quantum state classification, binary code recognition,and quaternary code recognition.

TI On-demand transposition across light-matter interaction regimes in
   bosonic cQED
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB The diverse applications of light-matter interactions in science and technology stem from the qualitatively distinct ways these interactions manifest, prompting the development of physical platforms that can interchange between regimes on demand. Bosonic cQED employs the light field of high-Q superconducting cavities coupled to nonlinear circuit elements, harnessing the rich dynamics of their interaction for quantum information processing. However, implementing fast switching of the interaction regime without deteriorating the cavity coherence is a significant challenge. We present an experiment that achieves this feat, combining nanosecond-scale frequency tunability of a transmon coupled to a cavity with lifetime of hundreds of microseconds. Our implementation affords a range of useful capabilities for quantum information processing; from fast creation of cavity Fock states using resonant interaction and interchanging tomography techniques at qualitatively distinct interaction regimes on the fly, to the suppression of unwanted cavity-transmon dynamics during idle evolution. By bringing flux tunability into the bosonic cQED toolkit, our work opens up the possibility to probe the full range of light-matter interaction dynamics within a single platform and provides valuable pathways towards robust and versatile quantum information processing.
   Current bosonic circuit QED setups lack tunability across interaction regimes between a superconducting cavity and a nonlinear circuit element. Here the authors achieve such tunability in a cavity-transmon system by using a magnetic hose for fast flux control of the qubit while preserving the cavity coherence.

TI Entanglement in a holographic Schwinger pair with confinement
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW D
AB We revisit the entanglement of a Schwinger pair created by external fields of arbitrary strength, using a holographic dual description of QCD. When external fields are strong in comparison to the string tension, the entanglement is geometrically tied to the Einstein-Rosen (ER) bridge in the bulk, and disappears when the pair production is not exponentially suppressed at the boundary. For moderate external fields, the entanglement is shown to follow from the geometrical interplay between the position of the ER bridge and the confining wall in the bulk. We clarify the physical nature of quantum entanglement in pair production, and connect it to the entropy of entanglement between the left- and right-moving fermions. In particular, we clarify the effect of real radiation off the produced particles on quantum entanglement of the pair.

TI Time-Resolved Hanbury Brown-Twiss Interferometry of On-Chip Biphoton
   Frequency Combs Using Vernier Phase Modulation
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW APPLIED
AB Biphoton frequency combs (BFCs) are promising quantum sources for large-scale and high-dimensional quantum information and networking systems. In this context, the spectral purity of individual frequency bins will be critical for realizing quantum networking protocols like teleportation and entanglement swap-ping. Measurement of the temporal autocorrelation function of the unheralded signal or idler photons comprising the BFC is a key tool for characterizing their spectral purity and in turn verifying the utility of the biphoton state for networking protocols. Yet the experimentally obtainable precision for measur-ing BFC correlation functions is often severely limited by detector jitter. The fine temporal features in the correlation function-not only of practical value in quantum information, but also of fundamen-tal interest in the study of quantum optics-are lost as a result. We propose a scheme to circumvent this challenge through electro-optic phase modulation, experimentally demonstrating time-resolved Han -bury Brown-Twiss characterization of BFCs generated from an integrated 40.5-GHz Si3N4 microring, up to a 3 x 3-dimensional two-qutrit Hilbert space. Through slight detuning of the electro-optic drive frequency from the comb's free spectral range, our approach leverages Vernier principles to magnify tem-poral features, which would otherwise be averaged out by detector jitter. We demonstrate our approach under both continuous-wave and pulsed-pumping regimes, finding excellent agreement with theory. Our method reveals not only the collective statistics of the contributing frequency bins but also their temporal shapes-features lost in standard fully integrated autocorrelation measurements.

TI Density Classification with Non-Unitary Quantum Cellular Automata
SO ENTROPY
AB The density classification (DC) task, a computation which maps global density information to local density, is studied using one-dimensional non-unitary quantum cellular automata (QCAs). Two approaches are considered: one that preserves the number density and one that performs majority voting. For number-preserving DC, two QCAs are introduced that reach the fixed-point solution in a time scaling quadratically with the system size. One of the QCAs is based on a known classical probabilistic cellular automaton which has been studied in the context of DC. The second is a new quantum model that is designed to demonstrate additional quantum features and is restricted to only two-body interactions. Both can be generated by continuous-time Lindblad dynamics. A third QCA is a hybrid rule defined by both discrete-time and continuous-time three-body interactions that is shown to solve the majority voting problem within a time that scales linearly with the system size.

TI Quantum Fisher information of a cosmic qubit undergoing non-Markovian de
   Sitter evolution
SO JOURNAL OF HIGH ENERGY PHYSICS
AB We revisit the problem of the thermalization process for an Unruh-DeWitt (UDW) detector in de Sitter space. We derive the complete dynamics of the detector in the context of an open quantum system, without utilizing Markovian or RWA approximations. We employ quantum Fisher information (QFI) to estimate the Hubble parameter, which serves as a process function to distinguish the thermalization paths in the detector's Hilbert space, determined by its local properties, including the detector's energy gap and its initial state preparation, or by the global spacetime geometry. We find that the non-Markovian contribution generally reduces the QFI compared to the Markovian approximated solution. Regarding arbitrary initial states, the late-time QFI converges to an asymptotic value. In particular, we are interested in the background field within the one-parameter family of alpha-vacua in de Sitter space. We show that for general choices of alpha-vacuum, the asymptotic values of the converged QFI are significantly suppressed compared to previously known results for the Bunch-Davies vacuum.

TI Ensemble qubit controllability with a single control via adiabatic and
   rotating wave approximations
SO JOURNAL OF DIFFERENTIAL EQUATIONS
AB In the physics literature it is common to use "in cascade" the rotating wave approximation and the adiabatic approximation for chirped pulses of two-level quantum systems driven by one external field, in particular when the resonance frequency is not known precisely. Both approximations need relatively long time and are based on averaging theory of dynamical systems. Unfortunately, the two approximations cannot be done independently since, in a sense, the two time scales interact. We study how the cascade of the two approximations can be justified, while preserving the robustness of the adiabatic strategy. Our first result, based on high-order averaging techniques, gives a precise quantification of the uncertainty interval of the resonance frequency for which the population inversion works. As a by-product, we prove controllability of an ensemble of spin systems by a single real-valued control, providing an extension of a celebrated result with two controls by Khaneja and Li.(c) 2022 Elsevier Inc.

In particular, it remains an outstanding challenge to explicitly construct local hidden-variable (LHV) models for arbitrary multipartite entangled states. To address this, we use gradient-descent algorithms from machine learning to find LHV models that reproduce the statistics of arbitrary measurements for quantum many-body states. In contrast to previous approaches, our method employs a general ansatz, enabling it to discover LHV models for all local states. Therefore, it for example provides actual estimates for the critical noise levels at which two-qubit Werner states and three-qubit Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger and W states become local. Furthermore, we find evidence suggesting that two-spin subsystems in the ground states of translationally invariant Hamiltonians are genuinely local, while bigger subsystems are in general not. Our method now offers a quantitative tool for determining the regimes of nonlocality in any given physical context, such as nonequilibrium, decoherence, or disorder.

TI Scrambling ability of quantum neural network architectures
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB In this Letter, we propose a guiding principle for how to design the architecture of a quantum neural network in order to achieve a high learning efficiency. This principle is inspired by the equivalence between extracting information from the input state to the readout qubit and scrambling information from the readout qubit to input qubits. We characterize the quantum information scrambling by operator size growth. By Haar random averaging over operator sizes, we propose an averaged operator size to describe the information scrambling ability of a given quantum neural network architecture. The key conjecture of this Letter is that this quantity is positively correlated with the learning efficiency of this architecture. To support this conjecture, we consider several different architectures, and we also consider two typical learning tasks. One is a regression task of a quantum problem, and the other is a classification task on classical images. In both cases, we find that, for the architecture with a larger averaged operator size, the loss function decreases faster or the prediction accuracy increases faster as the training epoch increases, which means higher learning efficiency. Our results can be generalized to more complicated quantum versions of machine learning algorithms.

TI Freedom of the mixer rotation axis improves performance in the quantum
   approximate optimization algorithm
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Variational quantum algorithms such as the quantum approximate optimization algorithm (QAOA) are particularly attractive candidates for implementation on near-term quantum processors. As hardware realities such as error and qubit connectivity will constrain achievable circuit depth in the near future, new ways to achieve high performance at low depth are of great interest. In this work, we present a modification to QAOA that adds additional variational parameters in the form of freedom of the rotation axis in the XY plane of the mixer Hamiltonian. Via numerical simulation, we show that this leads to a drastic performance improvement over standard QAOA at finding solutions to the MaxCut problem on graphs of up to seven qubits. Furthermore, we explore the Z-phase error mitigation properties of our modified Ansatz, its performance under a realistic error model for a neutral atom quantum processor, and the class of problems it can solve in a single round.

TI QSLT: A Quantum-Based Lightweight Transmission Mechanism against
   Eavesdropping for IoT Networks
SO WIRELESS COMMUNICATIONS & MOBILE COMPUTING
AB Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) is a promising paradigm for Internet of Things (IoT) networks against eavesdropping attacks. However, classical quantum-based mechanisms are overweight and expensive for resource-constrained IoT devices. That is, the devices need to frequently exchange with the QKD controller via an out-band quantum channel. In this paper, we propose a novel Quantum-based Secure and Lightweight Transmission (QSLT) mechanism to ease the overweight pain for IoT devices against eavesdropping. Particularly, the mechanism predistributes quantum keys into IoT devices with SIM cards. Using one of the keys, QSLT encrypts or decrypts IoT sensitive data. It is noting that an in-band key-selection method is used to negotiate the session key between two different devices. For example, on one IoT device, the in-band method inserts a key-selection field at the end of the encrypted data to indicate the key's sequence number. After another device receives the data, QSLT extracts the key-selection field and decrypts the data with the selected quantum key stored locally. We implement the proposed mechanism and evaluate its security and transmission performances. Experimental results show that QSLT can transmit IoT data with a lower delay while guaranteeing the security performance. Besides, QSLT also decreases power usage by approximately 58.77% compared with state of the art mechanisms.

TI Nonclassical coincidences of atomic and mechanical excitations
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Hybrid systems hold promise to provide an advantage in future quantum technology. Operating such systems outside the classical regime is crucially important to fully realize their potential. We investigate a pulsed quantum nondemolition gate between a cloud of atoms and a mechanical oscillator in distant cavities and demonstrate that this gate is capable of producing nonclassical coincidences of excitations in the disparate subsystems interacting by light. The nonclassicality is justified by evaluation of excitations created simultaneously in both modes beyond any joint classical states of such subsystems. To test the result, we use a nonclassicality witness based on available homodyne tomography of the atomic and mechanical states. Using feasible parameters, we show that it is possible to turn the pulsed dynamics of the state-of-the-art systems into nonclassical coincidences, and illustrate it for the cases of the atom-light, optomechanical, and atom-mechanical hybrid interactions. These tests are necessary to open full investigation of quantum correlations in hybrid systems.

TI Ultrabright source of non-degenerate polarization-entangled photon pairs
   based on off-the-shelf polarization optics
SO APPLIED PHYSICS LETTERS
AB We report a Sagnac-type source based on a MgO:PPLN non-linear crystal pumped with a 532 nm continuous-wave laser, which generates spectrally non-degenerate, polarization-entangled photon pairs of 785 nm signal and 1651 nm idler wavelength, via the type-0 spontaneous parametric downconversion (SPDC) process. We use standard off-the-shelf components; hence, no custom-designed multi-wavelength polarization optics are required. At the same time, long-term phase stability can be achieved due to the geometry of our Sagnac-type design. The source's brightness is 6.17(4) x 10(6) pairs/sec/mW, which is comparable to the brightest state-of-the-art non-degenerate polarization entangled photon-pair source. The spectral bandwidth of the single photon is approximately 195 GHz (root mean square). The fidelity of the entangled state is measured to be 96.72(1)%, the concurrence is 94.7(2)%, and the Bell-CHSH value S = 2.71(6). This source has the potential to be applied in long-distance quantum communication using both free-space and fiber links simultaneously. (c) 2023 Author(s).

TI Linear Quantum Coupler for Clean Bosonic Control
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB Quantum computing with superconducting circuits relies on high-fidelity driven nonlinear processes. An ideal quantum nonlinearity would selectively activate desired coherent processes at high strength, without activating parasitic mixing products or introducing additional decoherence. The wide bandwidth of the Josephson nonlinearity makes this difficult, with undesired drive-induced transitions and decoherence limiting qubit readout, gates, couplers, and amplifiers. Significant strides have recently been made into building better "quantum mixers," with promise being shown by Kerr-free three-wave mixers that suppress driven frequency shifts, and balanced quantum mixers that explicitly forbid a significant fraction of parasitic processes. We propose a novel mixer that combines both these strengths, with engineered selection rules that make it essentially linear (not just Kerr-free) when idle, and activate clean parametric processes even when driven at high strength. Furthermore, its ideal Hamiltonian is simple to analyze analytically, and we show that this ideal behavior is first-order insensitive to dominant experimental imperfections. We expect this mixer to allow significant advances in high-Q control, readout, and amplification.

TI Classifying global state preparation via deep reinforcement learning
SO MACHINE LEARNING-SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB Quantum information processing often requires the preparation of arbitrary quantum states, such as all the states on the Bloch sphere for two-level systems. While numerical optimization can prepare individual target states, they lack the ability to find general control protocols that can generate many different target states. Here, we demonstrate global quantum control by preparing a continuous set of states with deep reinforcement learning. The protocols are represented using neural networks, which automatically groups the protocols into similar types, which could be useful for finding classes of protocols and extracting physical insights. As application, we generate arbitrary superposition states for the electron spin in complex multi-level nitrogen-vacancy centers, revealing classes of protocols characterized by specific preparation timescales. Our method could help improve control of near-term quantum computers, quantum sensing devices and quantum simulations.

TI Thermal spectrometer for superconducting circuits
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Superconducting circuits provide a versatile and controllable platform for studies of fundamental quantum phenomena as well as for quantum technology applications. A conventional technique to read out the state of a quantum circuit or to characterize its properties is based on RF measurement schemes. Here we demonstrate a simple DC measurement of a thermal spectrometer to investigate properties of a superconducting circuit, in this proof-of-concept experiment a coplanar waveguide resonator. A fraction of the microwave photons in the resonator is absorbed by an on-chip bolometer, resulting in a measurable temperature rise. By monitoring the DC signal of the thermometer due to this process, we are able to determine the resonance frequency and the lineshape (quality factor) of the resonator. The demonstrated scheme, which is a simple DC measurement, offers a wide frequency band potentially reaching up to 200 GHz, far exceeding that of the typical RF spectrometer. Moreover, the thermal measurement yields a highly frequency independent reference level of the Lorentzian absorption signal. In the low power regime, the measurement is fully calibration-free. Our technique offers an alternative spectrometer for quantum circuits.

TI Tunable High-Power 420 nm Laser with External Cavity Frequency Doubling:
   Toward Efficient Rubidium Rydberg Excitation
SO PHOTONICS
AB The external cavity frequency doubling technique serves as a potent method for generating short-wavelength lasers, yet achieving high-power outputs remains challenging due to the thermal lens effect. This study systematically investigates the generation mechanism of the thermal lens effect and its impact on laser performance. By optimizing the bow-tie cavity design and leveraging a large beam waist of 106 mu m to suppress thermal-induced distortions, we demonstrate a tunable 420 nm laser with up to 800 mW of output power and a peak conversion efficiency of 77%. The fundamental light source, a Ti:Sa laser locked to an ultra-stable cavity, ensures a narrow linewidth, flexible tunability, and long-term frequency stability. This high-performance blue laser enables the efficient Rydberg excitation of rubidium atoms, presenting critical applications in quantum computing, quantum simulation, and quantum precision measurement.

TI Quantum query complexity of Boolean functions under indefinite causal
   order
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB The standard model of quantum circuits assumes operations are applied in a fixed sequential "causal" order. In recent years, the possibility of relaxing this constraint to obtain causally indefinite computations has received significant attention. The quantum switch, for example, uses a quantum system to coherently control the order of operations. Several ad hoc computational and information-theoretical advantages have been demonstrated, raising questions as to whether advantages can be obtained in a more unified complexity theoretic framework. In this paper, we approach this problem by studying the query complexity of Boolean functions under general higher-order quantum computations. To this end, we generalize the framework of query complexity from quantum circuits to quantum supermaps to compare different models on an equal footing. We show that the recently introduced class of quantum circuits with quantum control of causal order cannot lead to any reduction in query complexity, and that any potential advantage arising from causally indefinite supermaps can be bounded by the polynomial method, as is the case with quantum circuits. Nevertheless, we find some functions for which the minimum error with which they can be computed using two queries is strictly lower when exploiting causally indefinite supermaps.

TI Quantum-Inspired Multi-Objective Optimization Framework for Dynamic
   Wireless Electric Vehicle Charging in Highway Networks Under Stochastic
   Traffic and Renewable Energy Variability
SO WORLD ELECTRIC VEHICLE JOURNAL
AB The rapid adoption of electric vehicles (EVs) and the increasing reliance on renewable energy sources necessitate innovative charging infrastructure solutions to address key challenges in energy efficiency, grid stability, and sustainable transportation. Dynamic wireless charging systems, which enable EVs to charge while in motion, offer a transformative approach to mitigating range anxiety and optimizing energy utilization. However, these systems face significant operational challenges, including dynamic traffic conditions, uncertain EV arrival patterns, energy transfer efficiency variations, and renewable energy intermittency. This paper proposes a novel quantum computing-assisted optimization framework for the modeling, operation, and control of wireless dynamic charging infrastructure in urban highway networks. Specifically, we leverage Variational Quantum Algorithms (VQAs) to address the high-dimensional, multi-objective optimization problem associated with real-time energy dispatch, charging pad utilization, and traffic flow coordination. The mathematical modeling framework captures critical aspects of the system, including power balance constraints, state-of-charge (SOC) dynamics, stochastic vehicle arrivals, and charging efficiency degradation due to vehicle misalignment and speed variations. The proposed methodology integrates quantum-inspired optimization techniques with classical distributionally robust optimization (DRO) principles, ensuring adaptability to system uncertainties while maintaining computational efficiency. A comprehensive case study is conducted on a 50 km urban highway network equipped with 20 charging pad segments, supporting an average traffic flow of 10,000 EVs per day. The results demonstrate that the proposed quantum-assisted approach significantly enhances energy efficiency, reducing energy losses by up to 18% compared to classical optimization methods. Moreover, traffic-aware adaptive charging strategies improve SOC recovery by 25% during peak congestion periods while ensuring equitable energy allocation among different vehicle types. The framework also facilitates a 30% increase in renewable energy utilization, aligning energy dispatch with periods of high solar and wind generation. Key insights from the case study highlight the critical impact of vehicle alignment, speed variations, and congestion on wireless charging performance, emphasizing the need for intelligent scheduling and real-time optimization. The findings contribute to advancing the integration of quantum computing into sustainable transportation planning, offering a scalable and robust solution for next-generation EV charging infrastructure.

TI Detecting quantum steering in networks
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Quantum networks promise an unprecedented leap in semi-device-independent communication and security by capitalizing on quantum steering. However, current methods for assessing quantum network steering are constrained to specific cases. In this work, we introduce the network-Clauser-Horn-Shimony-Holt-like inequality for investigating network steering independent of entanglement source characteristics. We employ this inequality to detect full network steering in both single-node and multinode repeater networks and assess the tolerance of various noise models. Under a specific noise model, our method is used to compute the bound of semidevice-independent communication distance. Through case studies, we also demonstrate that our method, as a semi-device-independent entanglement witness, is more suitable for settings requiring Bell measurements compared to network Bell inequality. These findings open new avenues for broader ways to detect quantum steering independent of entanglement sources.

TI Experimental demonstration of a diamond quantum vector magnetometer for
   deep-sea applications
SO NATIONAL SCIENCE REVIEW
AB Magnetometry plays an important role in exploring the deep sea, which is one of the Earth's final unknown frontiers. However, the complexity of the marine environment and the limitations of conventional magnetometers restrict its in-depth application. The nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center in diamond offers a potential solution to encompass and transcend conventional ocean magnetometers. Its unique advantages, such as precise vector measurement and tolerance to extreme environments, make it well suited for deep-sea applications like navigation. This work introduces the first deep-sea quantum vector magnetometer based on NV centers. The performance of this magnetometer is effectively validated by a series of field tests on the manned submersible Shenhai Yongshi during a cruise in the South China Sea, including an experimental underwater navigation using the diamond quantum sensor as a magnetic compass. This successful deep-sea application marks a milestone for transforming this promising solid-state spin quantum system into a practical sensor for real-world marine applications.

TI Entanglement Hamiltonian and effective temperature of non-Hermitian
   quantum spin ladders
SO SCIPOST PHYSICS CORE
AB Quantum entanglement plays a crucial role not only in understanding Hermitian manybody systems but also in offering valuable insights into non-Hermitian quantum systems. In this paper, we analytically investigate the entanglement Hamiltonian and entanglement energy spectrum of a non-Hermitian spin ladder using perturbation theory in the biorthogonal basis. Specifically, we examine the entanglement properties between coupled non-Hermitian quantum spin chains. In the strong coupling limit (Jrung >> 1), first-order perturbation theory reveals that the entanglement Hamiltonian closely resembles the single-chain Hamiltonian with renormalized coupling strengths, allowing for the definition of an ad hoc temperature. Our findings provide new insights into quantum entanglement in non-Hermitian systems and offer a foundation for developing novel approaches for studying finite temperature properties in non-Hermitian quantum many-body systems.

TI Nonreciprocal reflection in one-dimensional quasi-periodic defective

SO ACTA PHYSICA SINICA
AB In order to further investigate the non-reciprocity of light propagation in the defective atomic lattices, and due to its effective application in designing novel photonic devices, such as all-optical diodes and isolators, which are powerful tools for information processing and quantum simulation, we innovatively propose to use the Fibonacci sequence to modulate the arrangement of empty lattice cells that form a quasi periodic defective atomic lattices. In the electromagnetically induced transparency window, the probe light is almost not absorbed under the control of a strong coupling field (see Fig. 1). The numerical simulation indicates that a wide nonreciprocal reflection band can be achieved by modulating the number of filled lattice cells, Fibonacci sequence, the period number in a single quasi period (see Fig. 2). These results provide more degrees of freedom for regulating nonreciprocal reflection with wide bandwidth and high contrast, and have potential applications in quantum computing and information processing.

TI Can we control the amount of useful nonclassicality in a photon added
   hypergeometric state?
SO JOURNAL OF OPTICS
AB Non-Gaussianity inducing operations are studied in the recent past from different perspectives. Here, we study the role of photon addition, a non-Gaussianity inducing operation, in the enhancement of nonclassicality in a finite dimensional quantum state, namely hypergeometric state with the help of some quantifiers and measures of nonclassicality. We observed that measures to characterize the quality of single photon source and anticlassicality lead to the similar conclusion, i.e. to obtain the desired quantum features one has to choose all the state parameters such that average photon numbers remains low. Wigner logarithmic negativity of the photon added hypergeometric state and concurrence of the two-mode entangled state generated at the output of a beamsplitter from this state show that nonclassicality can be enhanced by increasing the state parameter and photon number addition but decreasing the dimension of the state. In principle, decreasing the dimension of the state is analogous to holeburning and is thus expected to increase nonclassicality. Further, the variation of Wigner function not only qualitatively illustrates the same features as observed quantitatively through concurrence potential and Wigner logarithimic negativity, but illustrate non-Gaussianity of the quantum state as well.

TI Efficient Two-Dimensional Defect-Free Dual-Species Atom Arrays
   Rearrangement Algorithm with Near-Fewest Atom Moves
SO CHINESE PHYSICS LETTERS
AB Dual-species single-atom array in optical tweezers has several advantages over the single-species atom array as a platform for quantum computing and quantum simulation. Thus, creating the defect-free dual-species single-atom array with atom numbers over hundreds is essential. As recent experiments demonstrated, one of the main difficulties lies in designing an efficient algorithm to rearrange the stochastically loaded dual-species atoms arrays into arbitrary demanded configurations. We propose a heuristic connectivity optimization algorithm to provide the near-fewest number of atom moves. Our algorithm introduces the concept of using articulation points in an undirected graph to optimize connectivity as a critical consideration for arranging the atom moving paths. Tested in array size of hundreds atoms and various configurations, our algorithm shows a high success rate (>97%), low extra atom moves ratio, good scalability, and flexibility. Furthermore, we propose a complementary step to solve the problem of atom loss during the rearrangement.

TI Simulating quantum field theories on continuous-variable quantum
   computers
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB We delve into the use of photonic quantum computing to simulate quantum mechanics and extend its application towards quantum field theory. We develop and prove a method that leverages this form of continuousvariable quantum computing (CVQC) to reproduce the time evolution of quantum-mechanical states under arbitrary Hamiltonians, and we demonstrate the method's remarkable efficacy with various potentials. Our method centers on constructing an evolver state, a specially prepared quantum state that induces the desired time evolution on the target state. This is achieved by introducing a non-Gaussian operation using a measurementbased quantum computing approach, enhanced by machine learning. Furthermore, we propose a framework in which these methods can be extended to encode field theories in CVQC without discretizing the field values, thus preserving the continuous nature of the fields. This opens new avenues for quantum computing applications in quantum field theory.

TI Superconductivity in transparent amorphous indium tin oxide films
   deposited by RF magnetron sputtering
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB Integrating superconductivity with high optical transparency is critical for advancing quantum technologies, yet remains fundamentally challenging due to photon damping at conventional superconductor interfaces. Here, we report the integrated circuit process compatible and scalable fabrication of transparent superconducting tin-doped indium oxide (ITO) thin films by RF magnetron sputtering without post-treatment. Combining Aslamazov-Larkin fluctuation theory and Ginzburg-Landau analysis, a superconducting transition temperature Tc of 1.43 K and the zero-temperature coherence length of 18.14 nm are determined. The two-dimensional nature of superconductivity is corroborated by a Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless transition near 0.8 K. These ITO films exhibit high transmittance across visible and near-infrared wavelengths, meeting the demands of quantum photonic applications. Comparative magneto-transport studies reveal that disorder suppresses electron-phonon coupling, thereby reducing Tc or even quenching superconductivity, while superconductivity itself suppresses weak localization (WL) signatures. Based on these observations, we propose a four-stage model describing the evolution from a normal metallic state to a phase-coherent superconducting phase through an interactive regime and a pre-pairing fluctuation regime. This work provides a simple and easy growth method for transparent ITO superconducting films and paves the way of exploring transparent superconductor for promising quantum material platforms.

TI Coherence analysis of local randomness and nonlocal correlation through
   polarization-basis projections of entangled photon pairs
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB Polarization-entangled photon pairs generated from second-order nonlinear optical media have been extensively studied for both fundamental research and potential applications of quantum information. In a spontaneous parametric down-conversion process, quantum entanglement between paired photons, often regarded as 'mysterious,' has been demonstrated for local randomness and nonlocal correlation through polarization-basis projections using linear optics (Phys. Rev. A 60, R773 (1999)). Unlike the conventional particle nature-based perspective, this paper presents a coherence analysis rooted in the wave nature of quantum mechanics to examine these well-established quantum phenomena, incorporating polarization control of the paired photons and their projection measurements. First, we analyze the quantum superposition of photon pairs generated randomly from cross-sandwiched nonlinear media, focusing on local randomness, which depends on the incoherence among measured events. Second, we investigate coincidence detection between paired photons to understand the nonlocal correlation arising from independently controlled remote parameters, resulting in an inseparable product-basis relationship. This coherence-based approach sheds light on a deterministic perspective on quantum features, emphasizing the significance of phase information intrinsic to the wave nature of photons, which is incompatible with the particle nature.

TI Perfect transfer of enhanced entanglement and asymmetric steering in a
   cavity-magnomechanical system
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB We propose a hybrid cavity magnomechanical system to realize and transfer the bipartite entanglements and Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR) steerings between magnons, photons, and phonons in the regime of stability of the system. As a parity-time-symmetric-like structure exhibiting the natural magnetostrictive magnon-phonon interaction, our passive-active cavity system can be explored to enhance the robust distant quantum entanglement and generate the relatively obvious asymmetric (even directional) EPR steering that is useful for the task with the highly asymmetric trusts of the bidirectional local measurements between two entangled states. It is of great interest that, based on such a tunable magnomechanical system, the perfect transfer between near and distant entanglements and steerings of different mode pairs is realized by adjusting the coupling parameters; in particular, we propose a perfect transfer scheme of steerings. These transferring processes suggest indeed an alternative method for quantum information storage and manipulation. In addition, the entanglements and steerings can also be exchanged between different mode pairs by adjusting the detunings between different modes. This work may provide a potential platform for distant and asymmetric quantum modulation.

TI Wavelength-insensitive, multispecies entangling gate for group-2 atomic
   ions
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB We propose an optical scheme for generating entanglement between co-trapped identical or dissimilar alkaline-earth atomic ions (Ca-40(+), Sr-88(+), Ba-13(+), Ra-226(+) ) which exhibits fundamental error rates below 10(-4) and can be implemented with a broad range of laser wavelengths spanning from ultraviolet to infrared. We also discuss straightforward extensions of this technique to include the two lightest group-2 ions (Be+, Mg+) for multispecies entanglement. The key elements of this wavelength-insensitive geometric phase gate are the use of a ground (S-1/2) and a metastable (D-5/2) electronic state as the qubit levels within sigma(z)-sigma(z) light-shift entangling gate. We present a detailed analysis of the principles and fundamental error sources for this gate scheme which includes photon scattering and spontaneous emission decoherence, calculating two-qubit-gate error rates and durations at fixed laser beam intensity over a large portion of the optical spectrum (300 nm to 2 mu m) for an assortment of ion pairs. We contrast the advantages and disadvantages of this technique against previous trapped-ion entangling gates and discuss its applications to quantum information processing and simulation with like and multispecies ion crystals.

TI Quantum Dot-Based Frequency Multiplier
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB Silicon offers the enticing opportunity to integrate hybrid quantum-classical computing systems on a single platform. For qubit control and readout, high-frequency signals are required. Therefore, devices that can facilitate its generation are needed. Here, we present a quantum dot-based radio-frequency multiplier operated at cryogenic temperatures. The device is based on the nonlinear capacitance-voltage character-istics of quantum dot systems arising from their low-dimensional density of states. We implement the multiplier in a multigate silicon-nanowire transistor using two complementary device configurations: a single quantum dot coupled to a charge reservoir and a coupled double quantum dot. We study the har-monic voltage conversion as a function of the energy detuning, the multiplication factor, and the harmonic phase noise and find near ideal performance up to a multiplication factor of 10. Our results demon-strate a method for high-frequency conversion that could be readily integrated into silicon-based quantum computing systems and be applied to other semiconductors.

TI Experimental Simulation of Open Quantum System Dynamics via
   Trotterization
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB Digital quantum simulators provide a diversified tool for solving the evolution of quantum systems with complicated Hamiltonians and hold great potential for a wide range of applications. Although much attention is paid to the unitary evolution of closed quantum systems, dissipation and noise are vital in understanding the dynamics of practical quantum systems. In this work, we experimentally demonstrate a digital simulation of an open quantum system in a controllable Markovian environment with the assistance of a single ancillary qubit. By Trotterizing the quantum Liouvillians, the continuous evolution of an open quantum system is effectively realized, and its application in error mitigation is demonstrated by adjusting the simulated noise intensities. High-order Trotter for open quantum dynamics is also experimentally investigated and shows higher accuracy. Our results represent a significant step toward hardware-efficient simulation of open quantum systems and error mitigation in quantum algorithms in noisy intermediate-scale quantum systems.

TI Extremal simplicial distributions on cycle scenarios with arbitrary
   outcomes
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICS A-MATHEMATICAL AND THEORETICAL
AB Cycle scenarios are a significant class of contextuality scenarios, with the Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt scenario being a notable example. While binary outcome measurements in these scenarios are well understood, the generalization to arbitrary outcomes remains less explored, except in specific cases. In this work, we employ homotopical methods in the framework of simplicial distributions to characterize all contextual vertices of the non-signaling polytope corresponding to cycle scenarios with arbitrary outcomes. Additionally, our techniques utilize the bundle perspective on contextuality and the decomposition of measurement spaces. This enables us to extend beyond scenarios formed by gluing cycle scenarios and describe contextual extremal simplicial distributions in these generalized contexts.

TI Mapping of valley splitting by conveyor-mode spin-coherent electron
   shuttling
SO NPJ QUANTUM INFORMATION
AB In Si/SiGe heterostructures, the low-lying excited valley state seriously limits the operability and scalability of electron spin qubits. For characterizing and understanding the local variations in valley splitting, fast probing methods with high spatial and energy resolution are lacking. Leveraging the spatial control granted by conveyor-mode spin-coherent electron shuttling, we introduce a method for two-dimensional mapping of the local valley splitting by detecting magnetic field-dependent anticrossings of ground and excited valley states using entangled electron spin-pairs as a probe. The method has sub-mu eV energy accuracy and a nanometer lateral resolution. The histogram of valley splittings spanning a large area of 210 nm by 18 nm matches well with statistics obtained by the established but time-consuming magnetospectroscopy method. For the specific heterostructure, we find a nearly Gaussian distribution of valley splittings and a correlation length similar to the quantum dot size. Our mapping method may become a valuable tool for engineering Si/SiGe heterostructures for scalable quantum computing.

TI Interplay Between Time and Energy in Bosonic Noisy Quantum Metrology
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB Quantum entanglement and coherence often allow for protocols that outperform classical ones in estimating a system's parameter. When using infinite-dimensional probes (such as a bosonic mode), one could, in principle, obtain infinite precision in a finite time for both classical and quantum protocols, which makes it hard to quantify potential quantum advantage. However, such a situation is unphysical, as it would require infinite resources, so one needs to impose some additional constraint: typically the average energy employed by the probe is finite. Here we treat both energy and time as a resource, showing that, in the presence of noise, there is a nontrivial interplay between the average energy and the time devoted to the estimation. Our results are valid for the most general metrological schemes (e.g., adaptive schemes, which may involve entanglement with external ancillae or any kind of continuous measurement). We apply recently derived precision bounds for all parameters characterizing the paradigmatic case of a bosonic mode, subject to Lindbladian noise. We show how the time employed in the estimation should be partitioned in order to achieve the best possible precision. In most cases, the optimal performance may be obtained without the necessity of adaptivity or entanglement with ancilla. We compare results with classical strategies. Interestingly, for temperature estimation, applying a fast-prepare-and-measure protocol with Fock states provides better scaling with the number of photons than any classical strategy.

TI Reversing Hydrogen-Related Loss in α-Ta Thin Films for Quantum Device
   Fabrication
SO ADVANCED SCIENCE
AB alpha-Tantalum (alpha-Ta) is an emerging material for superconducting qubit fabrication due to the low microwave loss of its stable native oxide. However, hydrogen absorption during fabrication, particularly when removing the native oxide, can degrade performance by increasing microwave loss. This work demonstrates that hydrogen can enter alpha-Ta thin films when exposed to 10 vol% hydrofluoric acid for 3 min or longer, leading to an increase in power-independent ohmic loss in high-Q resonators at millikelvin temperatures. It is further shown that annealing at 500 degrees C in ultra-high vacuum (10-8 Torr) for 1 h fully removes hydrogen and restores the resonators' intrinsic quality factors to approximate to 4 million at the single-photon level. These findings identify a previously unreported loss mechanism in alpha-Ta and offer a pathway to reverse hydrogen-induced degradation in quantum devices based on alpha-Ta and, by extension also Nb, enabling more robust fabrication processes for superconducting qubits.

TI Single nuclear spin detection and control in a van der Waals material
SO NATURE
AB Optically active spin defects in solids1,2 are leading candidates for quantum sensing3,4 and quantum networking5,6. Recently, single spin defects were discovered in hexagonal boron nitride (hBN)7, 8, 9, 10-11, a layered van der Waals (vdW) material. Owing to its two-dimensional structure, hBN allows spin defects to be positioned closer to target samples than in three-dimensional crystals, making it ideal for atomic-scale quantum sensing12, including nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) of single molecules. However, the chemical structures of these defects7, 8, 9, 10-11 remain unknown and detecting a single nuclear spin with a hBN spin defect has been elusive. Here we report the creation of single spin defects in hBN using 13C ion implantation and the identification of three distinct defect types based on hyperfine interactions. We observed both S = 1/2 and S = 1 spin states within a single hBN spin defect. We demonstrated atomic-scale NMR and coherent control of individual nuclear spins in a vdW material, with a pi-gate fidelity up to 99.75% at room temperature. By comparing experimental results with density functional theory (DFT) calculations, we propose chemical structures for these spin defects. Our work advances the understanding of single spin defects in hBN and provides a pathway to enhance quantum sensing using hBN spin defects with nuclear spins as quantum memories.

TI Portable maser oscillator at room temperature with reduced magnetic
   field requirements through spatial orientation
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW APPLIED
AB Masers could transform medical sensing and boost qubit readout detection due to their superb lownoise amplification. The negatively charged nitrogen-vacancy diamond maser is the only continuous-wave solid-state maser operable at room temperature; however, it requires cumbersome magnets, which prevent its widespread use. We present a significant size reduction of the diamond maser oscillator using a much lighter electromagnet with a small footprint, reducing the weight from 2000 kg to a more portable 30 kg. We achieve a maximum oscillator output power near -80 dBm, ten times higher than the first implementation, and discover techniques to reduce the magnetic field strength required for masing by 30 mT through precise manipulation of spin orientation. With the diamond maser now shrunk to a size that can fit on a benchtop, we move continuous-wave room-temperature masers away from the confines of research laboratories and closer to transforming readouts in quantum computing, frequency standards, and quantum-limited medical sensing.

TI Controlled Spalling of 4H Silicon Carbide with Investigated Spin
   Coherence for Quantum Engineering Integration
SO ACS NANO
AB We detail scientific and engineering advances which enable the controlled spalling and layer transfer of single crystal 4H silicon carbide (4H-SiC) from bulk substrates. 4H-SiC's properties, including high thermal conductivity and a wide bandgap, make it an ideal semiconductor for power electronics. Moreover, 4H-SiC is an excellent host of solid-state atomic defect qubits for quantum computing and quantum networking. Because 4H-SiC substrates are expensive (due to long growth times and limited yield), techniques for removal and transfer of bulk-quality films are desirable for substrate reuse and integration of the separated films. In this work, we utilize updated approaches for stressor layer thickness control and spalling crack initiation to demonstrate controlled spalling of 4H-SiC, the highest fracture toughness crystal spalled to date. We achieve coherent spin control of neutral divacancy (VV0) qubit ensembles and measure a quasi-bulk spin T2 of 79.7 mu s in the spalled films.

TI Security estimation of LWE via BKW algorithms
SO CYBERSECURITY
AB The Learning With Errors (LWE) problem is widely used in lattice-based cryptography, which is the most promising post-quantum cryptography direction. There are a variety of LWE-solving methods, which can be classified into four groups: lattice methods, algebraic methods, combinatorial methods, and exhaustive searching. The Blum-Kalai-Wasserman (BKW) algorithm is an important variety of combinatorial algorithms, which was first presented for solving the Learning Parity With Noise (LPN) problem and then extended to solve LWE. In this paper, we give an overview of BKW algorithms for solving LWE. We introduce the framework and key techniques of BKW algorithms and make comparisons between different BKW algorithms and also with lattice methods by estimating concrete security of specific LWE instances. We also briefly discuss the current problems and potential future directions of BKW algorithms.

TI Multi-Unitary Complex Hadamard Matrices
SO OPEN SYSTEMS & INFORMATION DYNAMICS
AB We analyze the set of real and complex Hadamard matrices with additional symmetry constrains. In particular, we link the problem of existence of maximally entangled multipartite states of 2k subsystems with d levels each to the set of complex Hadamard matrices of order N = dk. To this end, we investigate possible subsets of such matrices which are, dual, strongly dual (H = HR or H = H Gamma), two-unitary (HR and H Gamma are unitary), or k-unitary. Here XR denotes reshuffling of a matrix X describing a bipartite system, and X Gamma its partial transpose. Such matrices find several applications in quantum many-body theory, tensor networks and classification of multipartite quantum entanglement and imply a broad class of analytically solvable quantum models in 1 + 1 dimensions.

TI Quantum imaginary-time control for accelerating the ground-state
   preparation
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Quantum computers have been widely speculated to offer significant advantages in obtaining the ground state of difficult Hamiltonian in chemistry and physics. In this work, we first propose a Lyapunov control-inspired strategy to accelerate the well-established imaginary-time method for ground-state preparation. We also dig for the source of acceleration of the imaginary-time process under Lyapunov control with theoretical understanding and dynamic process visualization. To make the method accessible in the noisy intermediate-scale quantum era, we further propose a variational form of the algorithm that could work with shallow quantum circuits. Through numerical experiments on a broad spectrum of realistic models, including molecular systems, 2D Heisenberg models, and Sherrington-Kirkpatrick models, we show that imaginary-time control may substantially accelerate the imaginary-time evolution for all systems and even generate orders of magnitude acceleration (suggesting order-of-magnitude acceleration) for challenging molecular Hamiltonians involving small energy gaps as impressive special cases. Finally, with a proper selection of the control Hamiltonian, the new variational quantum algorithm does not incur additional measurement costs compared to the original variational quantum imaginary-time algorithm.

TI Photonic quantum generative adversarial networks for classical data
SO OPTICA QUANTUM
AB In generative learning, models are trained to produce new samples that follow the distribution of the target data. These models were historically difficult to train, until proposals such as generative adversarial networks (GANs) emerged, where a generative and a discriminative model compete against each other in a minimax game. Quantum versions of the algorithm have since been designed for the generation of both classical and quantum data. While most work so far has focused on qubit-based architectures, in this article we present a quantum GAN based on linear optical circuits and Fock-space encoding, which makes it compatible with near-term photonic quantum computing. We demonstrate that the model can learn to generate images by training the model end-to-end experimentally on a single-photon quantum processor.

TI Thirty Years in Silicon Photonics: A Personal View
SO FRONTIERS IN PHYSICS
AB Silicon Photonics, the technology where optical devices are fabricated by the mainstream microelectronic processing technology, was proposed almost 30 years ago. I joined this research field at its start. Initially, I concentrated on the main issue of the lack of a silicon laser. Room temperature visible emission from porous silicon first, and from silicon nanocrystals then, showed that optical gain is possible in low-dimensional silicon, but it is severely counterbalanced by nonlinear losses due to free carriers. Then, most of my research focus was on systems where photons show novel features such as Zener tunneling or Anderson localization. Here, the game was to engineer suitable dielectric environments (e.g., one-dimensional photonic crystals or waveguide-based microring resonators) to control photon propagation. Applications of low-dimensional silicon raised up in sensing (e.g., gas-sensing or bio-sensing) and photovoltaics. Interestingly, microring resonators emerged as the fundamental device for integrated photonic circuit since they allow studying the hermitian and non-hermitian physics of light propagation as well as demonstrating on-chip heavily integrated optical networks for reconfigurable switching applications or neural networks for optical signal processing. Finally, I witnessed the emergence of quantum photonic devices, where linear and nonlinear optical effects generate quantum states of light. Here, quantum random number generators or heralded single-photon sources are enabled by silicon photonics. All these developments are discussed in this review by following my own research path.

TI Simulating the Evolution of von Neumann Entropy in Black Hole Hawking
   Radiation Using Biphoton Entanglement
SO ENTROPY
AB Addressing the black hole information paradox necessitates the exploration of various hypotheses and theoretical frameworks. Among these, the proposition to utilize quantum entanglement, as introduced by Don N. Page, shows great promise. This study builds upon Page's theoretical foundation and proposes a simplified model for elucidating the evolution of black hole von Neumann entropy. This model simulates the process of Hawking radiation using entangled photon pairs. Our experiment suggests that quantum entanglement may offer a plausible avenue for resolving the paradox, thereby lending support to Page's proposal. The results suggest that this model may contribution to the exploration of one of the most profound puzzles in theoretical physics.

TI Decoherence effects in quantum nondemolition measurement induced
   entanglement between Bose-Einstein condensates
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICS B-ATOMIC MOLECULAR AND OPTICAL PHYSICS
AB We study the robustness of quantum nondemolition (QND) measurement induced entanglement between Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs). We consider an experimental scheme where two BECs are placed in the paths of a Mach-Zehnder interferometer, and a QND interaction creates entanglement between coherent light and the atoms. We analyze the two dominant channels of decoherence, atomic dephasing and photon loss on the entangled states produced by this scheme. We calculate the effect of dephasing on the variance and expectation values of the spin operators, entanglement and correlation criteria. Our analysis does not use the Holstein-Primakoff approximation, and is capable of modelling long light-atom interaction times, producing non-Gaussian states beyond the two-mode squeezed states. In the presence of dephasing, the entangled states are robust in the macroscopic limit as long as the dimensionless interaction time is less than 1/root N, where N is the number of atoms in the BEC. For photon loss, the entangled states generated by long interaction times show a remarkable robustness that makes the scheme promising for various quantum information applications.

TI Multilevel Combinatorial Optimization across Quantum Architectures
SO ACM TRANSACTIONS ON QUANTUM COMPUTING
AB Emerging quantum processors provide an opportunity to explore new approaches for solving traditional problems in the post Moore's law supercomputing era. However, the limited number of qubits makes it infeasible to tackle massive real-world datasets directly in the near future, leading to new challenges in utilizing these quantum processors for practical purposes. Hybrid quantum-classical algorithms that leverage both quantum and classical types of devices are considered as one of the main strategies to apply quantum computing to large-scale problems. In this article, we advocate the use of multilevel frameworks for combinatorial optimization as a promising general paradigm for designing hybrid quantum-classical algorithms. To demonstrate this approach, we apply this method to two well-known combinatorial optimization problems, namely, the Graph Partitioning Problem, and the Community Detection Problem. We develop hybrid multilevel solvers with quantum local search on D-Wave's quantum annealer and IBM's gate-model based quantum processor. We carry out experiments on graphs that are orders of magnitude larger than the current quantum hardware size, and we observe results comparable to state-of-the-art solvers in terms of quality of the solution. Reproducibility: Our code and data are available at Reference [1].

TI Critical quantum geometric tensors of parametrically-driven nonlinear
   resonators
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB Parametrically driven nonlinear resonators represent a building block for realizing fault -tolerant quantum computation and are useful for critical quantum sensing. From a fundamental viewpoint, the most intriguing feature of such a system is perhaps the critical phenomena, which can occur without interaction with any other quantum system. The nonanalytic behaviors of its eigenspectrum have been substantially investigated, but those associated with the ground state wavefunction have largely remained unexplored. Using the quantum ground state geometric tensor as an indicator, we comprehensively establish a phase diagram involving the driving parameter epsilon and phase 0 . The results reveal that with the increase in epsilon , the system undergoes a quantum phase transition from the normal to the symmetry -breaking phase, with the critical point unaffected by 0 . Furthermore, the critical exponent and scaling dimension are obtained by an exact numerical method, which is consistent with previous works. Our numerical results show that the phase transition falls within the universality class of the quantum Rabi model. This work reveals that the quantum metric and Berry curvature display diverging behaviors across the quantum phase transition.

TI Mathematically Proving Bell Nonlocality Motivated by the GHZ Argument
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB Bell nonlocality of quantum states is an important resource in quantum information and then has various applications. It is usually detected by the violation of some Bell's inequalities and the all-versus-nothing test. In the present paper, we aim to establish some mathematical methods for proving Bell nonlocality without inequalities, inspired by the work [Phys. Rev. Lett., 89, 080402 (2002)] regarding the GHZ paradox. For self-containedness, we recall the mathematical definition of Bell nonlocality proposed in [Sci. China-Phys. Mech. Astron. 62, 030311 (2019)] and then give some basic properties on it. Then we derive some necessary conditions for a multipartite state to be Bell local and obtain some sufficient conditions for a state to be Bell nonlocal in terms of "expectations" of local observables without invoking Bell inequalities. Unlike the standard approach to nonlocality detection based on violation of Bell inequalities, the obtained criteria are formulated in terms of certain relations for expectation values of local observables that are constructed from the well-known GHZ paradoxes.

TI Quantum advantage of Monte Carlo option pricing
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICS COMMUNICATIONS
AB Quantum computers have the potential to provide quadratic speedup for Monte Carlo methods currently used in various classical applications. In this work, we examine the advantage of quantum computers for financial option pricing with the Monte Carlo method. Systematic and statistical errors are handled in a joint framework, and a relationship to quantum gate error is established. New metrics are introduced for the assessment of quantum advantage based on sample count and optimized error handling. We implement and analyze a Fourier series based approach and demonstrate its benefit over the more traditional rescaling method in function approximation. Our numerical calculations reveal the unpredictable nature of systematic errors, making consistent quantum advantage difficult with current quantum hardware. Our results indicate that very low noise levels, a two-qubit gate error rate below 10(-6), are necessary for the quantum method to outperform the classical one, but a low number of logical qubits (ca. 20) may be sufficient to see quantum advantage already.

TI Coherent Control over Nuclear Hyperpolarization Using an Optically
   Initializable Chromophore-Radical System
SO JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN CHEMICAL SOCIETY
AB Chromophore radicals (CR) are emerging as important components for molecular quantum information science (QIS), especially in the context of quantum sensing. Here, we demonstrate that the optically hyperpolarized electrons in a 1,6,7,12-tetrakis(4-tert-butylphenoxy)-perylene-3,4,9,10-bis(dicarboximide) (tpPDI) covalently linked to a partially deuterated 1,3-bis(diphenylene)-d 16-2-phenylallyl radical (BDPA-d 16) can be coherently manipulated via pulsed dynamic nuclear polarization (DNP) methods to transfer polarization to nuclear spins and back. Under light illumination at 85 K, electron hyperpolarization in BDPA is enhanced 2.1- to 2.4-fold over thermal polarization and lasts for more than 100 ms. By applying nuclear orientation via electron spin-locking (NOVEL) DNP, this optically amplified electron hyperpolarization was successfully transferred to a 1H nuclear spin within the CR system and efficiently returned to the electron spin for readout via reverse-NOVEL. The NOVEL transfer efficiency of 65% amounts to a 688-fold nuclear spin hyperpolarization of the target nuclear spin, considering the 2.1-fold electron spin hyperpolarization. This reversible coherent manipulation of hyperpolarization transfer highlights the utility of CR systems to initialize and read out nuclear spin states in a disordered matrix at moderate cryogenic temperatures. Coupled with CRs' environmental compatibility, tunability, and precise state initialization, these results highlight the promising role of nuclear spins in CRs for QIS applications, including quantum sensing and memory.

TI Efficient classical algorithms for simulating symmetric quantum systems
SO QUANTUM
AB In light of recently proposed quantum algorithms that incorporate symmetries in the hope of quantum advantage, we show that with symmetries that are restrictive enough, classical algorithms can efficiently emulate their quantum counterparts given certain classical descriptions of the input. Specifically, we give classical algorithms that calculate ground states and time-evolved expectation values for permutation-invariant Hamiltonians specified in the symmetrized Pauli basis with runtimes polynomial in the system size. We use tensor-network methods to transform symmetry-equivariant operators to the block-diagonal Schur basis that is of polynomial size, and then perform exact matrix multiplication or diagonalization in this basis. These methods are adaptable to a wide range of input and output states including those prescribed in the Schur basis, as matrix product states, or as arbitrary quantum states when given the power to apply low depth circuits and single qubit measurements.

TI Unsupervised event classification with graphs on classical and photonic
   quantum computers
SO JOURNAL OF HIGH ENERGY PHYSICS
AB Photonic Quantum Computers provide several benefits over the discrete qubit-based paradigm of quantum computing. By using the power of continuous-variable computing we build an anomaly detection model to use on searches for New Physics. Our model uses Gaussian Boson Sampling, a #P-hard problem and thus not efficiently accessible to classical devices. This is used to create feature vectors from graph data, a natural format for representing data of high-energy collision events. A simple K-means clustering algorithm is used to provide a baseline method of classification. We then present a novel method of anomaly detection, combining the use of Gaussian Boson Sampling and a quantum extension to K-means known as Q-means. This is found to give equivalent results compared to the classical clustering version while also reducing the O complexity, with respect to the sample's feature-vector length, from O(N) to O(log(N)).

TI Mechanisms and technological frontiers in inorganic surface engineering
   of diamond
SO REVIEWS IN INORGANIC CHEMISTRY
AB Diamond materials have evolved from mere protective coatings to multifaceted platforms that facilitate advancements in various domains, including electronics, catalysis, energy storage, and quantum technologies. Recent advancements in inorganic functionalization - including heteroatom doping, covalent grafting, plasma activation, nanostructuring, and hybridization with two-dimensional materials now afford meticulous control over band structure, surface energy, defect chemistry, and charge-transport dynamics. Nevertheless, existing scholarly reviews predominantly present qualitative analyses and lack quantitative frameworks that elucidate the impact of these modifications on overall performance. This review presents a comprehensive, data-driven synthesis, supported by meta-analysis tables that aggregate capacitance values, electrochemical windows, carrier mobilities, defect densities, thermal conductivities, sensitivity metrics, and NV-center coherence times, derived from over 97 studies. A methodical workflow establishes connections between synthesis methodologies, atomic modifications, resultant properties, and device-level functionalities. The evaluation of technology readiness and sustainability is conducted through Technology Readiness Level (TRL) mapping, assessment of industrial chemical vapor deposition (CVD) energy requirements, cost analyses, and environmental impact considerations, in alignment with Sustainable Development Goals. Emerging applications such as neuromorphic processors, quantum photonic circuits, and flexible bioelectronics are scrutinized critically, with a particular emphasis on AI-assisted dopant optimization and defect prediction recognized as pivotal avenues for expediting the development of sustainable materials.

TI Nonlocality of tripartite orthogonal product states
SO QUANTUM INFORMATION PROCESSING
AB Local distinguishability of orthogonal product states is an area of active research in quantum information theory. However, most of the relevant results about local distinguishability are found in bipartite quantum systems and very few are known in multipartite cases. In this paper, we construct a locally indistinguishable subset in C2d?C2d?C2d, d >= 2 that contains 18(d-1) orthogonal product states. Further, we generalize our method to arbitrary tripartite quantum systems Ck?Cl?Cm. This result helps us to understand the role of nonlocality without entanglement in multipartite quantum systems. Finally, we prove that a three-qubit GHZ state is sufficient as a resource to distinguish each of the above classes of states.

TI Purcell Enhancement of Silicon W Centers in Circular Bragg Grating
   Cavities
SO ACS PHOTONICS
AB Generating single photons on demand in silicon is a challenge to the scalability of silicon-on-insulator integrated quantum photonic chips. While several defects acting as artificial atoms have recently demonstrated an ability to generate antibunched single photons, practical applications require tailoring of their emission through quantum cavity effects. In this work, we perform cavity quantum electrodynamics experiments with ensembles of artificial atoms embedded in silicon-on-insulator microresonators. The emitters under study, known as W color centers, are silicon tri-interstitial defects created upon self-ion implantation and thermal annealing. The resonators consist of circular Bragg grating cavities, designed for moderate Purcell enhancement (F-p = 12.5) and efficient luminescence extraction (eta(coll) = 40% for a numerical aperture of 0.26) for W centers located at the mode antinode. When the resonant frequency mode of the cavity is tuned with the zero-phonon transition of the emitters at 1218 nm, we observe a 20-fold enhancement of the zero-phonon line intensity, together with a 2-fold decrease of the total relaxation time in time-resolved photoluminescence experiments. Based on finite-difference time-domain simulations, we propose a detailed theoretical analysis of Purcell enhancement for an ensemble of W centers, considering the overlap between the emitters and the resonant cavity mode. We obtain a good agreement with our experimental results assuming a quantum efficiency of 65 +/- 10% for the emitters in bulk silicon. Therefore, W centers open promising perspectives for the development of on-demand sources of single photons by harnessing cavity quantum electrodynamics in silicon photonic chips.

TI Four-wave mixing in silicon nanophotonic waveguides and microring
   resonators: influence of two-photon absorption
SO JOURNAL OF OPTICAL MICROSYSTEMS
AB Four-wave mixing (FWM) in silicon photonics offers promising applications in optical signal processing, wavelength conversion, and quantum photonics, necessitating a comprehensive understanding of its underlying physics and limitations. Stimulated four-wave mixing in silicon photonic wire waveguides has been investigated theoretically by considering two-photon absorption, free carrier absorption, and free carrier dispersion, etc., operating near lambda similar to 1550 nm. It has been shown that these effects severely degrade the performance when operating at higher pump power levels. We present exact numerical calculations of idler wavelength conversion efficiency and bandwidth taking into account the abovementioned nonlinearities, to show the effects of various parameters within the waveguide structure. We extended to investigate silicon photonic microring resonators in terms of the four-wave mixing performance of high-Q-value microring resonators, which are very promising as photon sources (spontaneous four-wave mixing) for large-scale quantum photonic circuits. Our analysis illustrates the limitations of analytical models in describing FWM in ring resonator behavior at a moderate input power level, necessitating a rigorous numerical approach. Experimentally, we demonstrate stimulated FWM (1525 nm <= lambda(p) <= 1575 nm) in a silicon photonic wire with a cross-section of 500 nmx220 nm and with a small waveguide length of 2 mm. The idler-to-signal conversion efficiency of about -35 dB has been measured for an approximate launched pump power of 30 mW. The conversion efficiency is improved further in the microring resonator as predicted by the simulation results. (c) The Authors.

TI Bounding Quantum Capacities via Partial Orders and Complementarity
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INFORMATION THEORY
AB Quantum capacities are fundamental quantities that are notoriously hard to compute and can exhibit surprising properties such as superadditivity. Thus, a vast amount of literature is devoted to finding tight and computable bounds on these capacities. We add a new viewpoint by giving operationally motivated bounds on several capacities, including the quantum capacity and private capacity of a quantum channel and the one-way distillable entanglement and private key of a quantum state. These bounds are generally phrased in terms of capacity quantities involving the complementary channel or state. As a tool to obtain these bounds, we discuss partial orders on quantum channels and states, such as the less noisy and the more capable order. Our bounds help to further understand the interplay between different capacities, as they give operational limitations on superadditivity and the difference between capacities in terms of the information-theoretic properties of the complementary channel or state. They can also be used as a new approach towards numerically bounding capacities, as discussed with some examples.

TI Fluxonium qubits in a flip-chip package
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW APPLIED
AB The strong anharmonicity and high coherence times inherent to fluxonium superconducting circuits are beneficial for quantum information processing. In addition to requiring high-quality physical qubits, a quantum processor needs to be assembled in a manner that minimizes crosstalk and decoherence. In this paper, we report on fluxonium qubits packaged in a flip-chip architecture, where a classical control and readout chip is bump bonded to the quantum chip, forming a multichip module. The modular approach allows for improved connectivity between the qubits and control and readout elements, and separate fabrication processes. We characterize the coherence properties of the individual fluxonium qubits, demonstrate high-fidelity single-qubit gates with 6-ns microwave pulses (without DRAG), and identify the main decoherence mechanisms to improve on the reported results.

TI Temperature-dependent broadening of coherent current peaks in InAs
   double quantum dots
SO COMMUNICATIONS PHYSICS
AB Quantum systems as used for quantum computation or quantum sensing are nowadays often realized in solid state devices as e.g. complex Josephson circuits or coupled quantum-dot systems. Condensed matter as an environment influences heavily the quantum coherence of such systems. Here, we investigate electron transport through asymmetrically coupled InAs double quantum dots and observe an extremely strong temperature dependence of the coherent current peaks of single-electron tunneling. We analyze experimentally and theoretically the broadening of such coherent current peaks up to temperatures of 20K and we are able to model it with quantum dissipation being due to two different bosonic baths. These bosonic baths mainly originate from substrate phonons. Application of a magnetic field helps us to identify the different quantum dot states through their temperature dependence.
   With increasing temperature, current peaks in biased double quantum dots broaden and acquire a background stemming from the impact of environmental degrees of freedom such as phonons. Here, the authors measure this effect in an InAs heterostructure and demonstrate that it can be captured theoretically by two bosonic baths that model charge and current fluctuations.

TI Magnetic-field-driven rise and fall of a bipartite entanglement in a
   spin-liquid phase of a spin-1/2 Heisenberg branched chain
SO EUROPEAN PHYSICAL JOURNAL PLUS
AB The spin-1/2 Heisenberg branched chain with the unit cell composed of three spins in the main backbone and one spin at a side branching of one-dimensional chain is investigated with the help of density-matrix renormalization group (DMRG) and quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) methods. The DMRG simulations were employed to calculate zero-temperature magnetization curves and to construct the ground-state phase diagram, which is composed from four different ground states classified as gapped zero-plateau and one-half plateau phase, a gapless spin-liquid phase and a fully saturated phase. It is shown that the one-half magnetization plateau vanishes at the Kosterlitz-Thouless quantum critical point, which is wedged into a parameter space of the gapless quantum spin-liquid phase. The bipartite quantum entanglement between four distinct nearest-neighbor pairs of the spin-1/2 Heisenberg branched chain is quantified through the concurrence. It is found that the concurrence varies continuously within the quantum spin-liquid phase, where it may display a continuous rise, a continuous fall or eventually an intriguing rise-and-fall behavior. On the contrary, the concurrence is kept constant within two gapful zero- and one-half plateau phases. Temperature and magnetic-field dependencies of the magnetization and magnetic susceptibility computed within the QMC method uncover clear signatures of the quantum critical point at finite temperatures.

TI A unified AI-driven framework for quantum-secured 6G THz networks with
   intelligent reflecting surfaces and federated edge learning
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB The main contribution of this manuscript is an innovative framework for integrating Artificial Intelligence (AI) in 6G wireless systems. With increased complexity, including bursty traffic, network complexity, and dynamic variability, there is a need for intelligence. This study develops and validates an AI-driven approach that enhances network performance through quantum communication decoding, beamforming, and decentralized edge processing. Kalman filtering predictive models are used to estimate variable channel conditions in a Terahertz (THz) network to support beamforming to optimize beamforming. Artificial Intelligence exploits smart reflective surfaces (IRS) strengthening signals and improving their coverage. Also, strong security of Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) protocols due to AI enhanced error correction technology, and rapid, yet privacy information conducting at edge nodes due to decentralised processing through federated learning are examples of enhanced capabilities. Extensive ns-3 simulations across 100 independent runs validate the framework's effectiveness and prove the system in practical 6G deployment scenarios including THz links, IRS component and edge nodes. The simulation results demonstrate that the proposed framework achieves superior performance compared to conventional approaches, with statistical validation across multiple deployment scenarios. The system decreases latency by 30%, and adds 25% to spectral efficiency. In bursty traffic, the energy efficiency is increased by 20% and packets delivery ratio (PDR) is boosted by 15%. The AI algorithms work effectively to regulate the channel estimation, beamforming, and resource allocation, and, as a result, showed an improvement in the order of magnitudes over previous studies. These results support the fact that AI demonstrates significant potential for transformative impact to a 6G network. The framework has been efficient in addressing problems of channel estimation, beamforming and distributed processing and novel calculations in quantum communication security protocols. Such findings can be used as the foundation of the further inclusion of AI-based technologies in 6G systems, which will help to deploy robust, resilient, and autonomous wireless networks to address the needs of a connective society.

TI Fault-tolerant optical interconnects for neutral-atom arrays
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB We analyze the use of photonic links to enable large-scale fault-tolerant connectivity of locally error-corrected modules based on neutral atom arrays. Our approach makes use of recent theoretical results showing the robustness of surface codes to boundary noise and combines recent experimental advances in atom-array quantum computing with logical qubits with optical quantum networking techniques. We find the conditions for fault tolerance can be achieved with local two-qubit Rydberg gate and nonlocal Bell-pair errors below 1% and 10%, respectively, without requiring distillation or space-time overheads. Realizing the interconnects with a lens, a single optical cavity, or an array of cavities enables-with sufficient multiplexing-a Bell-pair generation rate in the 1-50 MHz range. When directly interfacing logical qubits, this rate translates to error-correction cycles in the 25-2000 kHz range, satisfying all requirements for fault tolerance and in the upper range fast enough for 100 kHz logical clock cycles.

TI Manipulation of flying and single excitons by GHz surface acoustic waves
SO AVS QUANTUM SCIENCE
AB An important prerequisite for quantum communication networks is the transfer and manipulation of single particles on a chip as well as their interconversion to single photons for long-range information exchange. GHz acoustic waves are versatile tools for the implementation of these functionalities in hybrid quantum systems. In particular, flying excitons propelled by GHz surface acoustic waves (SAWs) can potentially satisfy this prerequisite. In this article, we review recent works on the application of GHz SAWs to realize flying excitons in semiconductor-based systems. Most importantly, we have identified suitable two-level centers for the storage of single excitons, thus forming single excitonic qubits, and interconverted them to single photons with a very high emission rate dictated by the GHz-SAW pumping. The work covered here paves the way for on-chip, exciton-based qubit manipulation.

TI Engineering topological states in atom-based semiconductor quantum dots
SO NATURE
AB The realization of controllable fermionic quantum systems via quantum simulation is instrumental for exploring many of the most intriguing effects in condensed-matter physics(1-3). Semiconductor quantum dots are particularly promising for quantum simulation as they can be engineered to achieve strong quantum correlations. However, although simulation of the Fermi-Hubbard model(4) and Nagaoka ferromagnetism(5) have been reported before, the simplest one-dimensional model of strongly correlated topological matter, the many-body Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) model(6-11), has so far remained elusive-mostly owing to the challenge of precisely engineering long-range interactions between electrons to reproduce the chosen Hamiltonian. Here we show that for precision-placed atoms in silicon with strong Coulomb confinement, we can engineer a minimum of six all-epitaxial in-plane gates to tune the energy levels across a linear array of ten quantum dots to realize both the trivial and the topological phases of the many-body SSH model. The strong on-site energies (about 25 millielectronvolts) and the ability to engineer gates with subnanometre precision in a unique staggered design allow us to tune the ratio between intercell and intracell electron transport to observe clear signatures of a topological phase with two conductance peaks at quarter-filling, compared with the ten conductance peaks of the trivial phase. The demonstration of the SSH model in a fermionic system isomorphic to qubits showcases our highly controllable quantum system and its usefulness for future simulations of strongly interacting electrons.

TI Experimental scheme of non-critical squeezed light field detection
SO ACTA PHYSICA SINICA
AB The squeezed state, as an important quantum resource, has great potential applications in quantum computing, quantum communication and precision measurement. In the noncritically squeezed light theory, the predicted noncritically squeezed light can be generated by breaking the spontaneous rotational symmetry occurring in a degenerate optical parametric oscillator (DOPO) pumped above threshold. The reliability of this kind of squeezing is crucially important, as its quantum performance is robust to the pump power in experiment. However, the detected squeezing degrades rapidly in detection, because the squeezed mode orientation diffuses slowly, resulting in a small mode mismatch during the homodyne detection. In this paper, we propose an experimentally feasible scheme to detect noncritically squeezing reliable by employing the spatial mode swapping technic. Theoretically, the dynamic fluctuation aroused by random mode rotation in the squeezing detection can be compensated for perfectly, and 3 dB squeezing can be achieved robustly even with additional vacuum noise. Our scheme makes an important step forward for the experimental generation of noncritically squeezed light.

TI Nitrogen-Vacancy Center Coupled to an Ultrasmall-Mode-Volume Cavity: A
   High-Efficiency Source of Indistinguishable Photons at 200 K
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW APPLIED
AB Solid-state atomlike systems have great promise for linear optic quantum computing and quantum communication but are burdened by phonon sidebands and broadening due to surface charges. Nevertheless, coupling to a small-mode-volume cavity would allow high rates of extraction from even highly dephased emitters. We consider the nitrogen-vacancy center in diamond, a system understood to have a poor quantum optics interface with highly distinguishable photons, and design a silicon nitride cavity that allows 99% efficient extraction of photons at 200 K with an indistinguishability of 50%, improvable by external filtering. We analyze our design using Lumerical FDTD simulations and treat optical emission using a cavity-QED master equation valid at and beyond strong coupling and that includes both zero-phonon line broadening and sideband emission. The simulated design is compact (< 10 ?m) and, owing to its planar geometry, can be fabricated using standard silicon processes. Our work therefore points toward scalable fabrication of noncryogenic atomlike efficient sources of indistinguishable photons.

TI Quantum neural networks meet federated learning for DNA mutation
   prediction
SO COMPUTATIONAL AND STRUCTURAL BIOTECHNOLOGY JOURNAL
AB In this work, we introduce QuanGAT, a hybrid framework integrating quantum neural networks (QNNs), graph attention networks (GATs), and federated learning to tackle DNA mutation prediction in biomedical graphs in a privacy-preserving, noise-aware setting. Motivated by quantum biology's potential to describe mutation-level mechanisms, our approach is able to simulate decentralized genomic environments in order to protect sensitive data, while capturing complex biological variability. QuanGAT employs a QNN encoder based on parameterized quantum circuits, incorporating quantum noise, via the so-called depolarizing and amplitude damping channels. Furthermore, in order to enforce differential privacy, QuanGAT utilizes an attention-based architecture enhanced with Laplace noise. We evaluated the model on mutation-enriched protein-protein interaction networks, partitioned across simulated clients under centralized, federated, and noisy scenarios. In particular, we employed QuanGAT in three different datasets, namely PPI, STRING, and OBGN-Proteins. Especially in federated learning settings, QuanGAT consistently outperformed certain state-of-the-art graph neural networks up to 4.5 % in terms of accuracy and up to 6.3 % in terms of macro F1 score. Our findings demonstrate that integrating QNN encodings with attention-based graph learning may improve DNA mutation prediction in decentralized, privacy-aware settings.

TI Adversarial attacks on hybrid classical-quantum deep learning models for
   histopathological cancer detection
SO APL MACHINE LEARNING
AB We analyzed the application of quantum machine learning in histopathological cancer detection under adversarial attacks, demonstrating its potential to enhance diagnostic performance in adverse circumstances. Adversarial attacks are one of the major concerns in any image classification machine learning model and are responsible for perturbing the original input images, which, therefore, results in misclassification. To encounter this problem, we first developed the hybrid quantum transfer learning model by incorporating multiple transfer learning architectures such as ResNet-18, VGG-16, Inception-v3, and AlexNet with variational quantum circuits for histopathological cancer detection. Second, we introduced white-box adversarial attacks using the Fast Gradient Sign Method (FGSM) and DeepFool and projected gradient descent (PGD) methods in this model and evaluated each model's performance against these adversarial attacks. We analyzed that the Hybrid Classical Quantum Deep Learning model (HCQ-DL) with ResNet-18 provides 78.05% accuracy compared to the Classical ResNet-18 model with the highest accuracy of 50.84% for FGSM attacks. Similarly, for DeepFool attacks, HCQ-DL with ResNet-18 performs 52.12% accurately compared to the Classical ResNet-18 model with the highest accuracy of 37.87% and for PGD attacks, HCQ-DL with ResNet-18 has 52.94% performance accuracy compared to the Classical Inception-V3 model with the highest accuracy of 32.05%. As a result, we observed that HCQ-DL models are more resilient to these adversarial attacks compared to classical deep learning models and show potential to achieve greater robustness when combined with additional defense techniques.

TI Performance analysis of a hybrid agent for quantum-accessible
   reinforcement learning
SO NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB In the last decade quantum machine learning has provided fascinating and fundamental improvements to supervised, unsupervised and reinforcement learning (RL). In RL, a so-called agent is challenged to solve a task given by some environment. The agent learns to solve the task by exploring the environment and exploiting the rewards it gets from the environment. For some classical task environments, an analogue quantum environment can be constructed which allows to find rewards quadratically faster by applying quantum algorithms. In this paper, we analytically analyze the behavior of a hybrid agent which combines this quadratic speedup in exploration with the policy update of a classical agent. This leads to a faster learning of the hybrid agent compared to the classical agent. We demonstrate that if the classical agent needs on average < J > rewards and < T >(cl) epochs to learn how to solve the task, the hybrid agent will take < T >(q) <= alpha(s)alpha(o)root < T >(cl)< J > epochs on average. Here, alpha(s) and alpha(o) denote constants depending on details of the quantum search and are independent of the problem size. Additionally, we prove that if the environment allows for maximally alpha(o)k(max). sequential coherent interactions, e.g. due to noise effects, an improvement given by < T >(q) approximate to alpha(o) < T >(cl/)(4k(max)) is still possible.

TI Characterizing the boundary of the set of absolutely separable states
   and their generation via noisy environments
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB We characterize the boundary of the convex compact set of absolutely separable states, referred as AS, that cannot be transformed to entangled states by global unitary operators, in 2 circle times d Hilbert space. However, we show that the absolutely separable states of rank (2d - 1) are extreme points of such sets. We then discuss conditions to examine if a given full-rank absolutely separable state is an interior point or a boundary point of AS. Moreover, we construct two-qubit absolutely separable states which are boundary points but not extreme points of AS and prove the existence of full-rank extreme points of AS. Properties of certain interior points are also explored. We further show that by examining the boundary of the above set, it is possible to develop an algorithm to generate the absolutely separable states which stay outside the maximal ball. By considering paradigmatic noise models, we find the amount of local noise which the input entangled states can sustain, so that the output states do not become absolutely separable. Interestingly, we report that with the decrease of entanglement of the pure input state, critical depolarizing noise value, transferring an entangled state to an absolutely separable one, increases, thereby showing advantages of sharing nonmaximally entangled states. Furthermore, when the input two-qubit states are Haar uniformly generated, we report a hierarchy among quantum channels according to the generation of absolutely separable states.

TI Doppler-enhanced quantum magnetometry with thermal Rydberg atoms
SO NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB We report experimental measurements showing how one can combine quantum interference and thermal Doppler shifts at room temperature to detect weak magnetic fields. We pump 87 Rb atoms to a highly-excited, Rydberg level using a probe and a coupling laser, leading to narrow transmission peaks of the probe due to destructive interference of transition amplitudes, known as Electromagnetically Induced Transparency. While it is customary in such setups to use counterpropagating lasers to minimize the effect of Doppler shifts, here we show, on the contrary, that one can harness Doppler shifts in a copropagating arrangement to produce an enhanced response to a magnetic field. In particular, we demonstrate an order-of-magnitude bigger splitting in the transmission spectrum as compared to the counterpropagating case. We explain and generalize our findings with theoretical modeling and simulations based on a Lindblad master equation. Our results pave the way to using quantum effects for magnetometry in readily deployable room-temperature platforms.

   measurements

AB We present a generalized quantum scattering circuit which can be used to perform a noninvasive quantum measurement and implement it on NMR qubits. Such a measurement is a key requirement for testing temporal noncontextual inequalities. We use this circuit to experimentally demonstrate the violation of the Peres-Mermin inequality on a three-qubit NMR quantum information processor. Further, we experimentally construct a Belltype inequality corresponding to the temporal Klyachko-Can-Binicioglu-Shumovsky (KCBS) inequality, and demonstrate that the maximum quantum correlation is achieved for four two-point correlation functions involved in this inequality. The experimental violation of all the inequalities matches well with the theoretically predicted values, within experimental errors.

TI Fast flux control of 3D transmon qubits using a magnetic hose
SO APPLIED PHYSICS LETTERS
AB Fast magnetic flux control is a crucial ingredient for circuit quantum electrodynamics (cQED) systems. So far, it has been a challenge to implement this technology with the high coherence 3D cQED architecture. In this paper, we control the magnetic field inside a superconducting waveguide cavity using a magnetic hose, which allows flux control of 3D transmon qubits on time scales less than 100ns while maintaining a cavity quality factor larger than 10(6). The magnetic hose is designed as an effective microwave filter to not compromise the energy relaxation time of the qubit. The magnetic hose is a promising tool for fast magnetic flux control in various platforms intended for quantum information processing and quantum optics.

TI Unbreakable and breakable quantum censorship
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB A protocol for regulating the distribution of quantum information between multiple parties is put forward. To prohibit the unrestricted distribution of quantum -resource states in a public quantum network, agents can apply a resource -destroying map to each sender's channel. Since resource -destroying maps only exist for affine quantum resource theories, censorship of a nonaffine resource theory is established on an operationally motivated subspace of free states. This is achieved by using what we name a resource -censoring map. The protocol is applied to censoring coherence, reference frames, and entanglement. Because of the local nature of the censorship protocol, it is, in principle, possible for collaborating parties to bypass censorship. Thus, we additionally derive necessary and sufficient conditions under which the censorship protocol is unbreakable.

TI Efficient estimation of multipartite quantum coherence
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Quantification of coherence lies at the heart of quantum information processing and fundamental physics. Exact evaluation of coherence measures generally needs a full reconstruction of the density matrix, which becomes intractable for large-scale multipartite systems. Here, we propose a systematic theoretical approach to efficiently estimating lower and upper bounds of coherence in multipartite states. Under the stabilizer formalism, the lower bound is determined by the spectrum estimation method with a small number of measurements, and the upper bound is determined by a single measurement. We verify our theory with a four-qubit optical quantum system. We experimentally implement various multiqubit entangled states, including the Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger state, the cluster state, and the W state, and show how their coherences are efficiently inferred from measuring a few observables.

TI Shallow Silicon Vacancy Centers with Lifetime-Limited Optical Linewidths
   in Diamond Nanostructures
SO NANO LETTERS
AB The negatively charged silicon vacancy center (SiV-) in diamond is a promising, yet underexplored candidate for single-spin quantum sensing at sub kelvin temperatures and tesla-range magnetic fields. A key ingredient for such applications is the ability to perform all-optical, coherent addressing of the electronic spin of near-surface SiV- centers. We present a robust and scalable approach for creating individual, similar to 50 nm deep SiV- with lifetime-limited optical linewidths in diamond nanopillars through an easy-to-realize and persistent optical charge-stabilization scheme. The latter is based on single, prolonged 445 nm laser illumination that enables continuous photoluminescence excitation spectroscopy without the need for any further charge stabilization or repumping. Our results constitute a key step toward the use of near-surface, optically coherent SiV- for sensing under extreme conditions, and offer a powerful approach for stabilizing the charge-environment of diamond color centers for quantum technology applications.

AB Efficient, nanoscale precision alignment of defect center creation in photonics structures in challenges the realization of high-performance photonic devices and quantum technology applications. Here, we propose a facile self-aligned patterning technique based on conventional engineering technology, with doping precision that can reach similar to 15 nm. We demonstrate this technique by fabricating diamond nanopillar sensor arrays with high consistency and near-optimal photon counts. The sensor array achieves high yield approaching the theoretical limit, and high efficiency for filtering sensors with different numbers of nitrogen vacancy centers. Combined with appropriate crystal orientation, the system achieves a saturated fluorescence rate of 4.34 Mcps and effective fluorescence-dependent detection sensitivity of 1800 cps(-1/2). These sensors also show enhanced spin properties in the isotope-enriched diamond. Our technique is applicable to all similar solid-state systems and could facilitate the development of parallel quantum sensing and scalable information processing.

TI Quantum attacks on Sum of Even-Mansour construction utilizing online
   classical queries
SO EPJ QUANTUM TECHNOLOGY
AB The Sum of Even-Mansour (SoEM) construction, proposed by Chen et al. at Crypto 2019, has become the basis for designing some symmetric schemes, such as the nonce-based MAC scheme nEHtM(p) and the nonce-based encryption scheme CENCPP & lowast;. In this paper, we make the first attempt to study the quantum security of SoEM under the Q1 model where the targeted encryption oracle can only respond to classical queries rather than quantum ones. Firstly, we propose a quantum key recovery attack on SoEM21 with a time complexity of O(2(n/3)) along with O(2(n/3)) online classical queries. Compared with the current best classical result which requires O(2(2n/3)) time, our method offers a quadratic time speedup while maintaining the same number of queries. The time complexity of our attack is less than that observed for quantum exhaustive search by a factor of 2(n/6). We further propose classical and quantum key recovery attacks on the generalized SoEMs1 construction (consisting of s >= 2 independent public permutations), revealing that the application of quantum algorithms can provide a quadratic acceleration over the pure classical methods. Our results also imply that the quantum security of SoEM21 cannot be strengthened merely by increasing the number of permutations.

TI Entanglement routing via passive optics in CV-networks
SO EPJ QUANTUM TECHNOLOGY
AB Large-scale operations in quantum networks require efficient sorting of desired paths between nodes. In this article, we consider entanglement routing, which involves establishing an entanglement link between specific nodes in a large network of bosonic nodes. The networks are continuous-variable graph states built from finite squeezing and passive linear optics, shaped by complex network structures that mimic real-world networks. We construct a bipartite routing protocol with the specific goal of establishing a teleportation channel between two clients via passive optics operations locally operated by two different providers sharing the network. We provide criteria for extracting the aforementioned channel and, through the use of a derandomised evolutionary algorithm, extend the existing framework to study complex graph topologies.

TI Experimental demonstration of optimal probabilistic enhancement of
   quantum coherence
SO QUANTUM SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB We theoretically and experimentally investigate conditional enhancement of overall coherence of quantum states by probabilistic quantum operations that apply to the input state a quantum filter diagonal in the basis of incoherent states. We identify the optimal filters that for a given probability of successful filtering maximize the output coherence. We verify the performance of the studied quantum filters in a proof-of-principle experiment with linear optics, where a pair of two-level quantum systems is represented by polarization states of two photons. We comprehensively characterize the implemented two-qubit linear optical quantum filters by full quantum process tomography and we experimentally observe the optimal quantum coherence enhancement by quantum filtering.

TI Ancilla measurement-based quantum Otto engine using double-pair spin
   architecture
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW E
AB We present a quantum-heat engine model utilizing a dual spin-pair architecture, wherein an Otto-like cycle is implemented using a single heat bath. The conventional cold bath is replaced by a measurement protocol, enabling engine operation without the need for a second thermal reservoir. Unlike standard quantum-heat engines, our framework employs an ancillary spin pair in a two-dimensional configuration to regulate performance. Operating in finite time, the engine attains finite power, which is enhanced through quantum correlations, specifically correlation between spin pairs and projective measurements on the ancillary pair. The system consists of dual-qubit pairs, where one pair serves as the working medium and the other as an ancillary system facilitating measurement-induced heat exchange. We demonstrate that the engine efficiency can exceed the standard quantum Otto limit through local control of the ancillary pair while maintaining nonzero power output. Moreover, correlation between spin pairs enables efficiency modulation via the measurement basis, underscoring the role of quantum resources in optimizing quantum thermal machines.

TI Quantum Information Entropy for a Hyperbolic Double Well Potential in
   the Fractional Schrodinger Equation
SO ENTROPY
AB In this study, we investigate the position and momentum Shannon entropy, denoted as S-x and S-p, respectively, in the context of the fractional Schrodinger equation (FSE) for a hyperbolic double well potential (HDWP). We explore various values of the fractional derivative represented by k in our analysis. Our findings reveal intriguing behavior concerning the localization properties of the position entropy density, rho(s) (x), and the momentum entropy density, rho(s)( p), for low-lying states. Specifically, as the fractional derivative k decreases, rho(s) ( x) becomes more localized, whereas rho(s)( p) becomes more delocalized. Moreover, we observe that as the derivative k decreases, the position entropy Sx decreases, while the momentum entropy S-p increases. In particular, the sum of these entropies consistently increases with decreasing fractional derivative k. It is noteworthy that, despite the increase in position Shannon entropy S-x and the decrease in momentum Shannon entropy Sp with an increase in the depth u of the HDWP, the Beckner-Bialynicki-Birula-Mycielski (BBM) inequality relation remains satisfied. Furthermore, we examine the Fisher entropy and its dependence on the depth u of the HDWP and the fractional derivative k. Our results indicate that the Fisher entropy increases as the depth u of the HDWP is increased and the fractional derivative k is decreased.

TI Quantum Inflation: A General Approach to Quantum Causal Compatibility
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW X
AB Causality is a seminal concept in science: Any research discipline, from sociology and medicine to physics and chemistry, aims at understanding the causes that could explain the correlations observed among some measured variables. While several methods exist to characterize classical causal models, no general construction is known for the quantum case. In this work, we present quantum inflation, a systematic technique to falsify if a given quantum causal model is compatible with some observed correlations. We demonstrate the power of the technique by reproducing known results and solving open problems for some paradigmatic examples of causal networks. Our results may find applications in many fields: from the characterization of correlations in quantum networks to the study of quantum effects in thermodynamic and biological processes.

TI Towards ubiquitous radio access using nanodiamond based quantum
   receivers
SO COMMUNICATIONS ENGINEERING
AB The development of sixth-generation wireless communication systems demands innovative solutions to address challenges in the deployment of a large number of base stations and the detection of multi-band signals. Quantum technology, specifically nitrogen-vacancy centers in diamonds, offers promising potential for the development of compact, robust receivers capable of supporting multiple users. Here we propose a multiple access scheme using fluorescent nanodiamonds containing nitrogen-vacancy centers as nano-antennas. The unique response of each nanodiamond to applied microwaves allows for distinguishable patterns of fluorescence intensities, enabling multi-user signal demodulation. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our nanodiamonds-implemented receiver by simultaneously transmitting two uncoded digitally modulated information bit streams from two separate transmitters, achieving a low bit error ratio. Moreover, our design supports tunable frequency band communication and reference-free signal decoupling, reducing communication overhead. Furthermore, we implement a miniaturized device comprising all essential components, highlighting its practicality as a receiver serving multiple users simultaneously. This approach enables the integration of quantum sensing technologies into future wireless communication networks.

TI Quantum metrology with boundary time crystals
SO COMMUNICATIONS PHYSICS
AB Quantum sensing is one of the arenas that exemplifies the superiority of quantum technologies over their classical counterparts. Such superiority, however, can be diminished due to unavoidable noise and decoherence of the probe. Thus, metrological strategies to fight against or profit from decoherence are highly desirable. This is the case of certain types of decoherence-driven many-body systems supporting dissipative phase transitions, which might be helpful for sensing. Boundary time crystals are exotic dissipative phases of matter in which the time-translational symmetry is broken, and long-lasting oscillations emerge in open quantum systems at the thermodynamic limit. We show that the transition from a symmetry unbroken into a boundary time crystal phase, described by a second-order transition, reveals quantum-enhanced sensitivity quantified through quantum Fisher information. We also determine the critical exponents of the system and establish their relationship. Our scheme is indeed a demonstration of harnessing decoherence for achieving quantum-enhanced sensitivity. From a practical perspective, it has the advantage of being independent of initialization and can be captured by a simple measurement.

TI Transfer of arbitrary quantum states between separated superconducting
   cavities via an ensemble of nitrogen-vacancy centers
SO RESULTS IN PHYSICS
AB Transfer of quantum states between distant nodes is one of the most important preconditions for realizing large-scale quantum information processing. We here propose two ways to transfer an arbitrary quantum state between two separated superconducting cavities coupled to an ensemble of nitrogen-vacancy centers (NV ensemble). By using the double-swap scheme and theory of the dispersive regime, quantum states can be deterministically transferred between two superconducting cavities. With current hybrid circuit QED technology, the numerical simulations are performed to demonstrate that the single-photon state and cat state can be high-fidelity transferred between two superconducting cavities.

TI Concatenate codes, save qubits
SO NPJ QUANTUM INFORMATION
AB The essential requirement for fault-tolerant quantum computation (FTQC) is the total protocol design to achieve a fair balance of all the critical factors relevant to its practical realization, such as the space overhead, the threshold, and the modularity. A major obstacle in realizing FTQC with conventional protocols, such as those based on the surface code and the concatenated Steane code, has been the space overhead, i.e., the required number of physical qubits per logical qubit. Protocols based on high-rate quantum low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes gather considerable attention as a way to reduce the space overhead, but problematically, the existing fault-tolerant protocols for such quantum LDPC codes sacrifice other factors. Here, we construct a new fault-tolerant protocol to meet these requirements simultaneously based on more recent progress on the techniques for concatenated codes rather than quantum LDPC codes, achieving a constant space overhead, a high threshold, and flexibility in modular architecture designs. In particular, under a physical error rate of 0.1%, our protocol reduces the space overhead to achieve the logical CNOT error rates 10-10 and 10-24 by more than 90% and 96%, respectively, compared to the protocol for the surface code. Furthermore, our protocol achieves the threshold of 2.5% under a conventional circuit-level error model, substantially outperforming that of the surface code. The use of concatenated codes also naturally introduces abstraction layers essential for the modularity of FTQC architectures. These results indicate that the code-concatenation approach opens a way to significantly save qubits in realizing FTQC while fulfilling the other essential requirements for the practical protocol design.

TI Limitations on sharing Bell nonlocality between sequential pairs of
   observers
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB We give strong analytic and numerical evidence that, under mild measurement assumptions, two qubits cannot both be recycled to generate Bell nonlocality between multiple independent observers on each side. This is surprising, as under the same assumptions it is possible to recycle just one of the qubits an arbitrarily large number of times [P. J. Brown and R. Colbeck, Phys. Rev. Lett. 125, 090401 (2020)]. We derive corresponding one-sided monogamy relations that rule out two-sided recycling for a wide range of parameters, based on a general tradeoff relation between the strengths and maximum reversibilities of qubit measurements. We also show if the assumptions are relaxed to allow sufficiently biased measurement selections, then there is a narrow range of measurement strengths that allows two-sided recycling for two observers on each side, and propose an experimental test. Our methods may be readily applied to other types of quantum correlations, such as steering and entanglement, and hence to general information protocols involving sequential measurements.

TI Contextuality in Anomalous Heat Flow
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB In classical thermodynamics, heat must spontaneously flow from hot to cold systems. In quantum thermodynamics, the same law applies when considering multipartite product thermal states evolving unitarily. If initial correlations are present, anomalous heat flow can happen, temporarily making cold thermal states colder and hot thermal states hotter. Such an effect can happen due to entanglement but also because of classical randomness, hence lacking a direct connection with nonclassicality. In this work, we introduce scenarios in which anomalous heat flow does have a direct link to nonclassicality, defined as the failure of noncontextual models to explain experimental data. We start by extending known noncontextuality inequalities to a setup in which sequential transformations are considered. We then show a class of quantum prepare-transform-measure protocols, characterized by a time interval (0, tau c) for a given critical time tau c, where anomalous heat flow happens only if a noncontextuality inequality is violated. We also analyze a recent experiment from Micadei et al. [Nat. Commun. 10, 2456 (2019)] and find the critical time tau c based on the authors' experimental parameters. We conclude by investigating heat flow in the evolution of two-qudit systems, showing that our findings are not an artifact of using two-qubit systems.

TI Molecular Engineering of Emissive Molecular Qubits Based on
   Spin-Correlated Radical Pairs
SO JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN CHEMICAL SOCIETY
AB Spin chemistry of photogenerated spin-correlated radical pairs (SCRPs) offers a practical approach to control chemical reactions and molecular emissions by using weak magnetic fields. This capability to harness magnetic field effects (MFEs) paves the way for developing SCRPs-based molecular qubits. Here, we introduce a new series of donor-chiral bridge-acceptor (D-chi-A) molecules that demonstrate significant MFEs on fluorescence intensity and lifetime in solution at room temperature-critical for quantum sensing. By precisely tuning the donor site through torsional locking, distance extension, and planarization, we achieved remarkable control over key quantum properties, including field-response range and line width. In the most responsive systems, emission lifetimes increased by over 200%, and the total emission intensity was modulated by up to 30%. This level of tunability shows the power of synthetic spin chemistry. The rational design principle of optically addressable SCRP-based molecular systems, presented in this work, represents a major leap toward functional synthetic molecular qubits, advancing the field of molecular quantum technologies.

TI Quantum image edge detection based on eight-direction Sobel operator for
   NEQR
SO QUANTUM INFORMATION PROCESSING
AB Quantum Sobel edge detection (QSED) is a kind of algorithm for image edge detection using quantum mechanism, which can solve the real-time problem encountered by classical algorithms. However, the existing QSED algorithms only consider two- or four-direction Sobel operator, which leads to a certain loss of edge detail information in some high-definition images. In this paper, a novel QSED algorithm based on eight-direction Sobel operator is proposed, which not only reduces the loss of edge information, but also simultaneously calculates eight directions' gradient values of all pixel in a quantum image. In addition, the concrete quantum circuits, which consist of gradient calculation, non-maximum suppression, double threshold detection and edge tracking units, are designed in details. For a 2(n) x 2(n) image with q gray scale, the complexity of our algorithm can be reduced to O(n(2) + q(2)), which is lower than other existing classical or quantum algorithms. And the simulation experiment demonstrates that our algorithm can detect more edge information, especially diagonal edges, than the two- and four-direction QSED algorithms.

TI Building a controlled-NOT gate between polarization and frequency
SO OPTICA QUANTUM
AB By harnessing multiple degrees of freedom (DoFs) within a single photon, controlled quantum unitaries, such as the two-qubit controlled-NOT (cnot) gate, play a pivotal role in advancing quantum communication protocols such as dense coding and entanglement distillation. In this work, we devise and realize a cnot operation between polarization and frequency DoFs by exploiting directionally dependent electro-optic phase modulation within a fiber Sagnac loop. Alongside computational basis measurements, we validate the effectiveness of this operation through the synthesis of all four Bell states in a single photon, all with fidelities greater than 98%. This demonstration opens new avenues for manipulating hyperentanglement across these two crucial DoFs, marking a foundational step toward leveraging polarization-frequency resources in fiber networks for future quantum applications.

TI High-quality superconducting α-Ta film sputtered on the heated silicon
   substrate
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB Intrigued by the discovery of the long lifetime in the & alpha;-Ta/Al2O3-based Transmon qubit, researchers recently found & alpha;-Ta film is a promising platform for fabricating multi-qubits with long coherence time. To meet the requirements for integrating superconducting quantum circuits, the ideal method is to grow & alpha;-Ta film on a silicon substrate compatible with industrial manufacturing. Here we report the & alpha;-Ta film sputter-grown on Si (100) with a low-loss superconducting TiNx buffer layer. The & alpha;-Ta film with a large growth temperature window has a good crystalline character. The superconducting critical transition temperature (T-c) and residual resistivity ratio (RRR) in the & alpha;-Ta film grown at 500 & DEG;C are higher than that in the & alpha;-Ta film grown at room temperature (RT). These results provide crucial experimental clues toward understanding the connection between the superconductivity and the materials' properties in the & alpha;-Ta film and open a new route for producing a high-quality & alpha;-Ta film on silicon substrate for future industrial superconducting quantum computers.

TI Emergence of steady quantum transport in a superconducting processor
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Non-equilibrium quantum transport is crucial to technological advances ranging from nanoelectronics to thermal management. In essence, it deals with the coherent transfer of energy and (quasi-)particles through quantum channels between thermodynamic baths. A complete understanding of quantum transport thus requires the ability to simulate and probe macroscopic and microscopic physics on equal footing. Using a superconducting quantum processor, we demonstrate the emergence of non-equilibrium steady quantum transport by emulating the baths with qubit ladders and realising steady particle currents between the baths. We experimentally show that the currents are independent of the microscopic details of bath initialisation, and their temporal fluctuations decrease rapidly with the size of the baths, emulating those predicted by thermodynamic baths. The above characteristics are experimental evidence of pure-state statistical mechanics and prethermalisation in non-equilibrium many-body quantum systems. Furthermore, by utilising precise controls and measurements with single-site resolution, we demonstrate the capability to tune steady currents by manipulating the macroscopic properties of the baths, including filling and spectral properties. Our investigation paves the way for a new generation of experimental exploration of non-equilibrium quantum transport in strongly correlated quantum matter.
   The use of quantum simulators for studying non-equilibrium quantum transport has been limited. Here the authors demonstrate the steady quantum transport between many-body qubit baths on a superconducting quantum processor, revealing insights into pure-state statistical mechanics for nonequilibrium quantum systems.

TI Unsupervised manifold embedding to encode molecular quantum information
   for supervised learning of chemical data
SO COMMUNICATIONS CHEMISTRY
AB Molecular representation is critical in chemical machine learning. It governs the complexity of model development and the fulfillment of training data to avoid either over- or under-fitting. As electronic structures and associated attributes are the root cause for molecular interactions and their manifested properties, we have sought to examine the local electron information on a molecular manifold to understand and predict molecular interactions. Our efforts led to the development of a lower-dimensional representation of a molecular manifold, Manifold Embedding of Molecular Surface (MEMS), to embody surface electronic quantities. By treating a molecular surface as a manifold and computing its embeddings, the embedded electronic attributes retain the chemical intuition of molecular interactions. MEMS can be further featurized as input for chemical learning. Our solubility prediction with MEMS demonstrated the feasibility of both shallow and deep learning by neural networks, suggesting that MEMS is expressive and robust against dimensionality reduction.
   In machine learning of molecular properties, adequate molecular representation is crucial, as minor structural changes result in significant differences in the activity of interest. Here, the authors use a lower-dimensional representation of a molecular manifold to embed electronic attributes and retain the chemical intuition of molecular interactions, invariant to translational and rational degrees of freedom of the molecular surface, to ease model complexities and facilitate generalization even with relatively small datasets.

TI Control of stochastic quantum dynamics by differentiable programming
SO MACHINE LEARNING-SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB Control of the stochastic dynamics of a quantum system is indispensable in fields such as quantum information processing and metrology. However, there is no general ready-made approach to the design of efficient control strategies. Here, we propose a framework for the automated design of control schemes based on differentiable programming. We apply this approach to the state preparation and stabilization of a qubit subjected to homodyne detection. To this end, we formulate the control task as an optimization problem where the loss function quantifies the distance from the target state, and we employ neural networks (NNs) as controllers. The system's time evolution is governed by a stochastic differential equation (SDE). To implement efficient training, we backpropagate the gradient information from the loss function through the SDE solver using adjoint sensitivity methods. As a first example, we feed the quantum state to the controller and focus on different methods of obtaining gradients. As a second example, we directly feed the homodyne detection signal to the controller. The instantaneous value of the homodyne current contains only very limited information on the actual state of the system, masked by unavoidable photon-number fluctuations. Despite the resulting poor signal-to-noise ratio, we can train our controller to prepare and stabilize the qubit to a target state with a mean fidelity of around 85%. We also compare the solutions found by the NN to a hand-crafted control strategy.

   antitumor activity
SO CHEMICAL PHYSICS IMPACT
AB The current theoretical work interprets the optimized structure of 1-[(4-Chlorophenyl) methyl]-1H-indole-3-car- boxaldehyde [4CMI3C] by vibrational assignments that were theoretically assessed using the B3LYP 6-311 ++ G (d,P) level basis set. The structure was optimized with Gaussian 09 and the binding parameters were investigated. FT-IR and FT-RAMAN theoretical spectra of 4 CMIC3 were depicted and their spectroscopic calculations were verified. The three-dimensional charge circulation areas of the molecule, together with its electrophilic and nucleophilic sites, are all determined by molecular electrostatic potential (MEP). Frontier molecular orbitals are required for the molecule's stability and chemical reactivity. Natural bonding orbitals (NBO) are used to join up the fragments' bonds. The electronic dipole moment (mu D) and the first hyperpolarizability (beta tot) values of the investigated molecule were computed using Density Functional Theory and the results shows that the title molecule exhibits a non -linear property. The weak interaction and complex bonding zones have been studied using wave function analysis. The absorption spectra were computationally analyzed using UV-Vis spectra with various solvents utilizing TD-DFT method. The Lipinski rule of five stated that the title chemical explores a pharmacological profile. To execute protein-ligand binding with certain proteins that have already undergone processing in tumour cells, the AUTODOCK program is used. Additionally, title compound bioactive score and molecular docking properties are correlated with the FDA approved anti -tumor drug.

TI Generative flow-based warm start of the variational quantum eigensolver
SO NPJ QUANTUM INFORMATION
AB Hybrid quantum-classical algorithms like the variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) show promise for quantum simulations on near-term quantum devices, but are often limited by complex objective functions and expensive optimization procedures. Here, we propose Flow-VQE, a generative framework leveraging conditional normalizing flows with parameterized quantum circuits to efficiently generate high-quality variational parameters. By embedding a generative model into the VQE optimization loop through preference-based training, Flow-VQE enables quantum gradient-free optimization and offers a systematic approach for parameter transfer, accelerating convergence across related problems through warm-started optimization. We compare Flow-VQE to a number of standard benchmarks through numerical simulations on molecular systems, including hydrogen chains, water, ammonia, and benzene. We find that Flow-VQE generally outperforms baseline optimization algorithms, achieving computational accuracy with fewer circuit evaluations (improvements range from modest to more than two orders of magnitude) and, when used to warm-start the optimization of new systems, accelerates subsequent fine-tuning by up to 50-fold compared with Hartree-Fock initialization. Therefore, we believe Flow-VQE can become a pragmatic and versatile paradigm for leveraging generative modeling to reduce the costs of variational quantum algorithms.

TI Template-directed 2D nanopatterning of S=1/2 molecular spins
SO NANOSCALE HORIZONS
AB Molecular spins are emerging platforms for quantum information processing. By chemically tuning their molecular structure, it is possible to prepare a robust environment for electron spins and drive the assembly of a large number of qubits in atomically precise spin-architectures. The main challenges in the integration of molecular qubits into solid-state devices are (i) minimizing the interaction with the supporting substrate to suppress quantum decoherence and (ii) controlling the spatial distribution of the spins at the nanometer scale to tailor the coupling among qubits. Herein, we provide a nanofabrication method for the realization of a 2D patterned array of individually addressable Vanadyl Phthalocyanine (VOPc) spin qubits. The molecular nanoarchitecture is crafted on top of a diamagnetic monolayer of Titanyl Phthalocyanine (TiOPc) that electronically decouples the electronic spin of VOPc from the underlying Ag(100) substrate. The isostructural TiOPc interlayer also serves as a template to regulate the spacing between VOPc spin qubits on a scale of a few nanometers, as demonstrated using scanning tunneling microscopy, X-ray circular dichroism, and density functional theory. The long-range molecular ordering is due to a combination of charge transfer from the metallic substrate and strain in the TiOPc interlayer, which is attained without altering the pristine VOPc spin characteristics. Our results pave a viable route towards the future integration of molecular spin qubits into solid-state devices.

TI Narrowband stimulated Raman scattering and molecular modulation in
   anti-resonant hollow-core fibres
SO EPL
AB Raman scattering is the inelastic process where photons bounce off molecules, losing energy and becoming red-shifted. This weak effect is unique to each molecular species, making it an essential tool in, e.g., spectroscopy and label-free microscopy. The invention of the laser enabled a regime of stimulated Raman scattering (SRS), where the efficiency is greatly increased by inducing coherent molecular oscillations. However, this phenomenon required high intensities due to the limited interaction volumes, and this limitation was overcome by the emergence of anti- resonant fibres (ARFs) guiding light in a small hollow channel over long distances. Based on their unique properties, this Perspective reviews the transformative impact of ARFs on modern SRS- based applications ranging from development of light sources and convertors for spectroscopy and materials science, to quantum technologies for the future quantum networks, providing insights into future trends and the expanding horizons of the field.

   the Quark and Lepton Masses
SO SYMMETRY-BASEL
AB In this paper, we elaborate on the new understanding of the cosmological constant and the gauge hierarchy problems in the context of string theory in its metastring formulation, based on the concepts of modular spacetime and Born geometry. The interplay of phase space (and Born geometry), the Bekenstein bound, the mixing between ultraviolet (UV) and infrared (IR) physics and modular invariance in string theory is emphasized. This new viewpoint is fundamentally rooted in quantum contextuality and not in statistical observer bias (anthropic principle). We also discuss the extension of this point of view to the problem of masses of quarks and leptons and their respective mixing matrices.

TI Braiding Majorana zero mode in an electrically controllable way
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICS D-APPLIED PHYSICS
AB To realize the braiding operations of the Majorana zero modes in the vortex cores of a topological superconductor (TSC), a novel approach is proposed in this letter to replace the common tip (or tip-like) method. Instead of being on top of the TSC thin film, arrays of electrically controllable pinning centers are built beneath the film, hence detection can proceed along with braiding. This does not only increase the braiding rate, but also enables the braiding to be performed in an electrically controllable way and to be integrated into a large scale. Our work paves the way toward large-scale topological quantum computation.

TI Reducing quantum resources for attacking S-AES on quantum devices
SO NPJ QUANTUM INFORMATION
AB The Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) is one of the most widely used symmetric block cipher cryptography algorithms. Simplified-AES (S-AES) retains the structural framework of AES, making it an ideal model for elucidating the mechanism of symmetric cryptography. In this paper, we investigate potential quantum attacks on S-AES, utilizing both Grover-based algorithms and variational quantum algorithms (VQAs). For Grover-based attacks, we introduce an optimized oracle for implementing S-AES, reducing the complexity from 160 Toffoli gates to 120 by refining the SubNibble operation. Additionally, we propose a general Variational Quantum Attack Algorithm (VQAA) for any type of symmetric encryption that does not require the quantum implementation of the encryption procedure, which reduces the gate complexity substantially. These improvements enable the implementation of both Grover-based attacks and VQAA on superconducting quantum computers. The results demonstrate the feasibility of cryptographic analysis on currently available quantum hardware. Our findings also underscore the challenges of parameter optimization for S-AES, attributing the difficulty to the design of efficient parameterized quantum circuits, which constrain the effectiveness of variational algorithms. Despite these advancements, significant challenges remain in achieving quantum attacks on AES.

TI Symmetric Spaces of Qubits and Gaussian Modes
SO SYMMETRY-BASEL
AB The understanding of the properties of multipartite systems is a long-standing challenge in quantum theory that signals the need for new ideas and alternative frameworks that can shed light on the intricacies of quantum behavior. In this work, we argue that symmetric spaces provide a common language to describe two-qubit and two-mode Gaussian systems. Our approach relies on the use of equivalence classes that are defined by a subgroup of the maximal symmetry group of the system and involves an involution which enables the Cartan decomposition of the group elements. We work out the symmetric spaces of two qubits and two modes to identify classes which include an equal degree of mixing states, product states, and X states, among others. For three qubits and three modes, we point out how the framework can be generalized and report partial results about the physical interpretations of the symmetric spaces.

TI Information-Theoretic Concepts to Elucidate Local and Non-Local Aspects

SO JOURNAL OF THE MEXICAN CHEMICAL SOCIETY
AB This review explores the application of information theory in understanding chemical reactions, focusing on concepts like Shannon entropy, Fisher information, and complexity measures. By analyzing elementary chemical reactions, significant patterns in reactivity were identified, revealing chemically important regions and providing insights into reaction mechanisms. Further investigation extends to amino acids and pharmacological molecules, classifying them based on information-theoretic measures such as Shannon entropy and Fisher information. The proposed Information-Theoretic Space unveils unique aspects of many-electron systems, suggesting a universal 3D chemical space. Furthermore, we investigate the partitioning of molecules into constituent parts using Atoms-In-Molecules (AIM) schemes and their information-theoretic justifications. We validated popular AIM schemes like Hirshfeld, Bader's topological dissection, and the quantum approach within the Information Theory framework. Additionally, the study delves into the quantum origin of correlation energy, exploring the relationship between correlation energy and quantum entanglement. It also examines quantum entanglement features in dissociation processes of diatomic molecules, shedding light on critical points along reaction paths. Overall, this research highlights the utility of information theory in analyzing molecular complexity, providing insights into chemical processes and molecular behavior across various systems.

TI Non-Linear Quantum Dynamics in Coupled Double-Quantum- Dot-Cavity
   Systems
SO PHYSICS
AB The steady-state quantum dynamics of a compound sample consisting of a semiconductor double-quantum-dot (DQD) system, non-linearly coupled with a leaking superconducting transmission line resonator, is theoretically investigated. Particularly, the transition frequency of the DQD is taken to be equal to the doubled resonator frequency, whereas the inter-dot Coulomb interaction is considered weak. As a consequence, the steady-state quantum dynamics of this complex non-linear system exhibit sudden changes in its features, occurring at a critical DQD-cavity coupling strength, suggesting perspectives for designing on-chip microwave quantum switches. Furthermore, we show that, above the threshold, the electrical current through the double-quantum dot follows the mean photon number into the microwave mode inside the resonator. This might not be the case any more below that critical coupling strength. Lastly, the photon quantum correlations vary from super-Poissonian to Poissonian photon statistics, i.e., towards single-qubit lasing phenomena at microwave frequencies.

TI Beyond-mean-field phases of rotating dipolar condensates in the strongly
   correlated regime
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICS-CONDENSED MATTER
AB Rotating dipolar Bose-Einstein condensates exhibit rich physics due to the interplay of long-range interactions and rotation, leading to unconventional vortex structures and strongly correlated phases. While most studies rely on mean-field approaches, these fail to capture quantum correlations that become significant at high rotation speeds and strong interactions. In this study, we go beyond the mean-field description by employing a numerically exact multiconfigurational approach to study finite-sized dipolar condensates. We reveal novel vortex structures, rotating cluster states, and strong fragmentation effects, demonstrating that beyond-mean-field correlations remain prominent even in larger systems. By quantifying deviations from mean-field theory, we provide a predictive framework for analyzing experiments and exploring emergent quantum phases, with implications for both the fundamental theory of ultracold gases and the quantum simulation of correlated superfluid systems like in neutron stars.

TI Quantum natural gradient generalized to noisy and nonunitary circuits
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Variational quantum algorithms are promising tools whose efficacy depends on their optimization method. For noise-free unitary circuits, the quantum generalization of natural gradient descent has been introduced and shown to be equivalent to imaginary time evolution: the approach is effective due to a metric tensor reconciling the classical parameter space to the device's Hilbert space. Here we generalize quantum natural gradient to consider arbitrary quantum states (both mixed and pure) via completely positive maps; thus our circuits can incorporate both imperfect unitary gates and fundamentally nonunitary operations such as measurements. We employ the quantum Fisher information (QFI) as the core metric in the space of density operators. A modification of the error suppression by derangements (ESD) and virtual distillation (VD) techniques enables an accurate and experimentally efficient approximation of the QFI via the Hilbert-Schmidt metric tensor using prior results on the dominant eigenvector of noisy quantum states. Our rigorous proof also establishes the fundamental observation that the geometry of typical noisy quantum states is (approximately) identical in either the Hilbert-Schmidt metric or as characterized by the QFI. In numerical simulations of noisy quantum circuits we demonstrate the practicality of our approach and confirm it can significantly outperform other variational techniques.

TI Effects of Dynamical Decoupling and Pulse-Level Optimizations on IBM
   Quantum Computers
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON QUANTUM ENGINEERING
AB Currently available quantum computers are prone to errors. Circuit optimization and error mitigation methods are needed to design quantum circuits to achieve better fidelity when executed on NISQ hardware. Dynamical decoupling (DD) is generally used to suppress the decoherence error, and different DD strategies have been proposed. Moreover, the circuit fidelity can be improved by pulse-level optimization, such as creating hardware-native pulse-efficient gates. This article implements all the popular DD sequences and evaluates their performances on IBM quantum chips with different characteristics for various well-known quantum applications. Also, we investigate combining DD with the pulse-level optimization method and apply them to QAOA to solve the max-cut problem. Based on the experimental results, we find that DD can be a benefit for only certain types of quantum algorithms, while the combination of DD and pulse-level optimization methods always has a positive impact. Finally, we provide several guidelines for users to learn how to use these noise mitigation methods to build circuits for quantum applications with high fidelity on IBM quantum computers.

TI Site-Selective Preparation and Multistate Readout of Molecules in
   Tweezers
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB Polar molecules are a quantum resource with rich internal structure that can be coherently controlled. The structure, however, also makes the state preparation and measurement (SPAM) of molecules challenging. We advance the SPAM of individual molecules assembled from constituent atoms trapped in optical -tweezer arrays. Sites without NaCs molecules are eliminated using high-fidelity Cs atom detection, increasing the peak molecule filling fraction of the array threefold. We site -selectively initialize the array in a rotational qubit subspace that is insensitive to differential ac Stark shifts from the optical tweezer. Lastly, we detect multiple rotational states per experimental cycle by imaging atoms after sequential stateselective dissociations. These demonstrations extend the SPAM capabilities of molecules for quantum information, simulation, and metrology.

TI Characterization of the Spin and Crystal Field Hamiltonian of Erbium
   Dopants in Silicon
SO ADVANCED QUANTUM TECHNOLOGIES
AB The integration of coherent emitters into low-loss photonic circuits is a key technology for quantum networking. In this context, nanophotonic silicon devices implanted with erbium are a promising hardware platform that combines advanced wafer-scale nanofabrication technology with coherent emission in the minimal-loss band of optical fibers. Recent studies have reported two distinct sites in the silicon lattice in which erbium can be reproducibly integrated with particularly promising properties. Here, for an in-depth analysis of these sites, resonant fluorescence spectroscopy is performed on a nanophotonic waveguide in magnetic fields applied along different orientations. In this way, the site symmetry is determined, the spin Hamiltonian is reconstructed and a partial fit of the crystal field Hamiltonian is performed. The obtained quantitative description of the magnetic interaction allows the optimization of Zeeman splittings, optical branching ratios or microwave driving to the needs of future experiments. Beyond that, the derived site symmetry constrains the location of the erbium dopant in the silicon unit cell. This is a key step toward a detailed microscopic understanding of the erbium sites, which may help to improve the integration yield, thus paving the way to efficient nanophotonic quantum memories based on the Er:Si platform.

TI Investigation of the Time Behavior of the Second-Order Coherence
   Function of a Tunable Single-Photon Source
SO JOURNAL OF SPECTROSCOPY
AB Single-photon sources are critical optical components in quantum communication, in particular, for security applications. One of the essential parameters that define these sources is the magnitude of the second-order coherence function, whose investigation reveals the state of the emitted photon. In this study, we indicate that the second-order coherence function varies over time when using two lasers and preparing coherent population trapping. The calculation is based on solving the master equation to find the density matrix corresponding to the emission dynamics and provide the second-order coherence function. The changes of the second-order coherence function can be estimated and the system behavior regarding photon emission can be predicted by solving the master equation based on the parameters obtained from the experimental results of a nitrogen vacancy (NV) in a diamond. Here we report, for the first time to the best of our knowledge, that the state of the emitted photons persists in the strong interaction of the aforementioned process. As using two lasers is a familiar method for controlling the single-photon source and the stability of the source is an essential point in a quantum network, this study can be considered to develop quantum network components such as memory and on-demand single-photon sources. Also, it suggests a method for tuning photon statistics while controlling the photon states.

TI Ion-native variational ansatz for quantum approximate optimization
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Variational quantum algorithms involve training parametrized quantum circuits using a classical coprocessor. An important variational algorithm, designed for combinatorial optimization, is the quantum approximate optimization algorithm. Realization of this algorithm on any modern quantum processor requires either embedding a problem instance into a Hamiltonian or emulating the corresponding propagator by a gate sequence. For a vast range of problem instances this is impossible due to current circuit depth and hardware limitations. Hence we adapt the variational approach-using ion-native Hamiltonians-to create ansatz families that can prepare the ground states of more general problem Hamiltonians. We analytically determine symmetry protected classes that make certain problem instances inaccessible unless this symmetry is broken. We exhaustively search over six qubits and consider up to 20 circuit layers, demonstrating that symmetry can be broken to solve all problem instances of the Sherrington-Kirkpatrick Hamiltonian. Going further, we numerically demonstrate training convergence and levelwise improvement for up to 20 qubits. Specifically these findings widen the class problem instances which might be solved by ion based quantum processors. Generally these results serve as a test bed for quantum approximate optimization approaches based on system native Hamiltonians and symmetry protection.

TI Quantum-Zeno Fermi polaron in the strong dissipation limit
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB The interplay between measurement and quantum correlations in many-body systems can lead to novel types of collective phenomena which are not accessible in isolated systems. In this work, we merge the Zeno paradigm of quantum measurement theory with the concept of polarons in condensed-matter physics. The resulting quantum-Zeno Fermi polaron is a quasiparticle which emerges for lossy impurities interacting with a quantum-degenerate bath of fermions. For loss rates of the order of the impurity-fermion binding energy, the quasiparticle is short lived. However, we show that in the strongly dissipative regime of large loss rates a long-lived polaron branch reemerges. This quantum-Zeno Fermi polaron originates from the nontrivial interplay between the Fermi surface and the surface of the momentum region forbidden by the quantum-Zeno projection. The situation we consider here is realized naturally for polaritonic impurities in charge-tunable semiconductors and can be also implemented using dressed atomic states in ultracold gases.

TI Efficient Long-Range Entanglement Using Dynamic Circuits
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB Quantum simulation traditionally relies on unitary dynamics, inherently imposing efficiency constraints on the generation of intricate entangled states. In principle, these limitations can be superseded by nonunitary, dynamic circuits. These circuits exploit measurements alongside conditional feed-forward operations, providing a promising approach for long-range entangling gates, higher effective connectivity of near-term hardware, and more efficient state preparations. Here, we explore the utility of shallow dynamic circuits for creating long-range entanglement on large-scale quantum devices. Specifically, we study two tasks: controlled- NOT gate teleportation between up to 101 qubits by feeding forward 99 midcircuit measurement outcomes, and the preparation of Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger states with genuine entanglement. In the former, we observe that dynamic circuits can outperform their unitary counterparts. In the latter, by tallying instructions of compiled quantum circuits, we provide an error budget detailing the obstacles that must be addressed to unlock the full potential of dynamic circuits. Looking forward, we expect dynamic circuits to be useful for generating long-range entanglement in the near term on large-scale quantum devices.

TI Distribution of telecom entangled photons through a 7.7 km antiresonant
   hollow-core fiber
SO OPTICA QUANTUM
AB State of the art classical and quantum communications rely on standard optical fibers with solid cores to transmit light over long distances. However, recent advances have led to the emergence of antiresonant hollow-core optical fibers (AR-HCFs), which, due to the novel fiber geometry, show remarkable optical guiding properties, which are not as limited by the material properties as solid-core fibers. In this paper, we explore the transmission of entangled photons through a novel 7.7 km AR-HCF in a laboratory environment at 1550 nm, presenting the first successful demonstration of entanglement distribution via a long AR-HCF. In addition to showing these novel fibers are compatible with long distance quantum communication, we highlight the low latency and low chromatic dispersion intrinsic to AR-HCF, which can increase the secure key rate in time-bin-based quantum key distribution protocols.

TI Tight Bounds on the Spooky Pebble Game: Recycling Qubits with
   Measurements
SO QUANTUM
AB Pebble games are popular models for analyzing time-space trade-offs. In particular, reversible pebble game strategies are frequently applied in quantum algorithms like Grover's search to efficiently simulate classical computation on inputs in superposition, as unitary operations are fundamentally reversible. However, the reversible pebble game cannot harness the additional computational power granted by intermediate measurements, which are irreversible. The spooky pebble game, which models interleaved Hadamard basis measurements and adaptive phase corrections, reduces the number of qubits beyond what purely reversible approaches can achieve. While the spooky pebble game does not reduce the total space (bits plus qubits) complexity of the simulation, it reduces the amount of space that must be stored in qubits. We prove asymptotically tight trade-offs for the spooky pebble game on a line with any pebble bound. This in turn gives a tight time-qubit tradeoff for simulating arbitrary classical sequential computation when using the spooky pebble game. For example, for all e is an element of (0, 1], any classical computation requiring time T and space S can be implemented on a quantum computer using only O(T/e) gates and O((TS1-epsilon)-S-epsilon) qubits. This improves on the best known bound for the reversible pebble game with that number of qubits, which uses O(2(1/epsilon)T) gates. For smaller space bounds, we show that the spooky pebble game can simulate arbitrary computation with O(T1+epsilon S-epsilon/e) gates and O(S/e) qubits whereas any simulation via the reversible pebble game requires ohm(S <middle dot> (1 + log(T/S))) qubits. We also consider the spooky pebble game on more general directed acyclic graphs (DAGs), capturing fine-grained data dependency in computation. We show that for an arbitrary DAG even approximating the number of required pebbles in the spooky pebble game is PSPACE-hard. Despite this, we are able to construct a time-efficient strategy for pebbling binary trees that uses the minimum number of pebbles.

TI Learning quantum data with the quantum earth mover's distance
SO QUANTUM SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB Quantifying how far the output of a learning algorithm is from its target is an essential task in machine learning. However, in quantum settings, the loss landscapes of commonly used distance metrics often produce undesirable outcomes such as poor local minima and exponentially decaying gradients. To overcome these obstacles, we consider here the recently proposed quantum earth mover's (EM) or Wasserstein-1 distance as a quantum analog to the classical EM distance. We show that the quantum EM distance possesses unique properties, not found in other commonly used quantum distance metrics, that make quantum learning more stable and efficient. We propose a quantum Wasserstein generative adversarial network (qWGAN) which takes advantage of the quantum EM distance and provides an efficient means of performing learning on quantum data. We provide examples where our qWGAN is capable of learning a diverse set of quantum data with only resources polynomial in the number of qubits.

TI Heat rectification by two qubits coupled with Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya
   interaction
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW E
AB We investigate heat rectification in a two-qubit system coupled via the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya (DM) interaction. We derive analytical expressions for heat currents and thermal rectification and provide possible physical mechanisms behind the observed results. We show that the anisotropy of DM interaction in itself is insufficient for heat rectification, and some other form of asymmetry is needed. We employ off-resonant qubits as the source of this asymmetry. We find the regime of parameters for higher rectification factors by examining the analytical expressions of rectification obtained from a global master equation solution. In addition, it is shown that the direction and quality of rectification can be controlled via various system parameters. Furthermore, we compare the influence of different orientations of the DM field anisotropy on the performance of heat rectification. Finally, we investigate the possible interplay between quantum correlations and the performance of the quantum thermal rectifier. We find that asymmetry in the coherences is a fundamental resource for the performance of the quantum thermal rectifier.

TI Intelligent optimization based density matrix reconstruction method with
   semi-positive constraint
SO RESULTS IN PHYSICS
AB Quantum state tomography (QST) is a technique used to reconstruct the density matrix of unknown quantum states based on experimentally obtained measurements. QST is a fundamental tool in the field of quantum in-formation and quantum technology. It is commonly employed to assess the quality and limitations of experi-mental platforms. However, the density matrix reconstructed using the standard QST method often fails to guarantee semi-positive definiteness, which is physically unacceptable, due to limitations imposed by the randomness of quantum state measurements, noise in practical applications, and the number of measurements. To address this issue, a method is proposed that combines maximum likelihood (ML) estimation with population intelligence optimization algorithms. First, the issue of guaranteeing the semi-positive definiteness of the density matrix reconstructed using standard QST methods is analyzed. Subsequently, the ML method is introduced, and four commonly used population intelligence optimization algorithms are applied to find the density matrix that maximizes the likelihood of reproducing the experimental measurements. Finally, the superiority of the proposed method is demonstrated using an IBM Quantum (IBMQ) processor in scenarios involving separable and entangled states of multiple qubits, and compared with the standard QST method.

TI Low-Cost Preparation of Diamond Nanopillar Arrays Based on Polystyrene
   Spheres
SO ACS OMEGA
AB Diamond nanopillar arrays can enhance the fluorescence collection of diamond color centers, playing a crucial role in quantum communication and quantum sensing. In this paper, the preparation of diamond nanopillar arrays was realized by the processes of polystyrene (PS) sphere array film preparation, PS sphere etching shrinkage control, tilted magnetron sputtering of copper film, and oxygen plasma etching. Closely aligned PS sphere array films were prepared on the diamond surface by the gas-liquid interfacial method, and the effects of ethanol and dodecamethylacrylic acid solutions on the formation of the array films were discussed. Controllable reduction of PS sphere diameter is realized by the oxygen plasma etching process, and the changes of the PS sphere array film under the influence of etching power, bias power, and etching time are discussed. Copper antietching films were prepared at the top of arrayed PS spheres by the tilted magnetron sputtering method, and the antietching effect of copper films with different thicknesses was explored. Diamond nanopillar arrays were prepared by oxygen plasma etching, and the effects of etching under different process parameters were discussed. The prepared diamond nanopillars were in hexagonal close-rowed arrays with a spacing of 800 nm and an average diameter of 404 nm, and the spacing, diameter, and height could be parametrically regulated. Raman spectroscopy and photoluminescence spectroscopy detection revealed that the prepared diamond nanopillar array still maintains polycrystalline diamond properties, with only a small amount of the graphite phase appearing. Moreover, the prepared diamond nanopillar array can enhance the photoluminescence of diamond color centers by approximately 2 times. The fabrication method of diamond nanopillar array structures described in this article lays the foundation for quantum sensing technology based on diamond nanostructures.

TI 'Quantum supremacy' revisited: low-complexity, deterministic solutions
   of the original Deutsch-Jozsa problem in classical physical systems
SO ROYAL SOCIETY OPEN SCIENCE
AB The original Deutsch-Jozsa (oDJ) problem is for an oracle (realized here as a database) of size N, where, according to their claim, the deterministic solution of the problem on a classical Turing computer requires O(N) computational complexity. They produced the famous Deutsch-Jozsa quantum algorithm that offered an exponential speed-up over the classical computer, namely O[log(N)] complexity for the solution in a quantum computer. In this paper, the problem is implemented on an instantaneous noise-based logic processor. It is shown that, similarly to the quantum algorithm, the oDJ problem can deterministically be solved with O[log(N)] complexity. The implication is that by adding a truly random coin to a classical Turing machine and using this classical-physical algorithm can also speed up the deterministic solution of the Deutsch-Jozsa problem exponentially, similarly to the quantum algorithm. Then it is realized that the same database and the solution of the Deutsch-Jozsa problem can also be realized by using an identical algorithmic structure in a simpler way, even without noise/random coin. The only lost function in this new system, as compared with noise-based logic, is the ability to do generic parallel logic operations over the whole database. As the latter feature is not needed for the oDJ problem, it is concluded that the problem can be solved on a classical computer with O[log(N)] complexity even without a random coin. Therefore, while the oDJ algorithm is a historically important step in the developments of quantum computers, it is insufficient to prove quantum supremacy. Note, there is also a simplified Deutsch-Jozsa problem proposed later, which is more popular in the field; however, it is irrelevant for the present paper.

TI Genuine multipartite entanglement measure
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICS A-MATHEMATICAL AND THEORETICAL
AB Quantifying genuine entanglement is a crucial task in quantum information theory. In this work, we give an approach of constituting genuine m-partite entanglement measures from any bipartite entanglement and any k-partite entanglement measure, 3 <= k < m. In addition, as a complement to the three-qubit concurrence triangle proposed in (Phys. Rev. Lett. 127 040403), we show that the triangle relation is also valid for any continuous entanglement measure and system with any dimension. We also discuss the tetrahedron structure for the four-partite system via the triangle relation associated with tripartite and bipartite entanglement respectively. For multipartite system that contains more than four parties, there is no symmetric geometric structure as that of tri- and four-partite cases.

TI Processing Quantum Signals Carried by Electrical Currents
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB Recent developments in the coherent manipulation of electrons in ballistic conductors include the generation of time-periodic electrical currents involving one to few electronic excitations per period. However, using individual electrons as carriers of quantum information for flying qubit computation or quantum metrology applications calls for a general method to unravel the single-particle excitations embedded in a quantum electrical current and how quantum information is encoded within it. Here, we propose a general signal-processing algorithm to extract the elementary single-particle states, called electronic atoms of signal, present in any periodic quantum electrical current. These excitations and their mutual quantum coherence describe the excess single-electron coherence in the same way musical notes and score describe a sound signal emitted by a music instrument. This method, which is the first step towards the development of signal processing of quantum electrical currents is illustrated by assessing the quality of experimentally relevant single electron sources. The example of randomized quantum electrical currents obtained by regularly clocked but randomly injected unit-charge Lorentzian voltage pulses enables us to discuss how interplay of the coherence of the applied voltage and the Pauli principle alter the quantum coherence between the emitted single-particle excitations.

TI Entanglement and Symmetry Structure of N(=3) Quantum Oscillators
   with Disparate Coupling Strengths in a Common Quantum Field Bath
SO SYMMETRY-BASEL
AB In this paper, we study the entanglement structure of a system of N quantum oscillators with distinctive coupling strengths, all linearly coupled to a common massless scalar quantum field. This study is helpful in characterizing the notion of an entanglement domain and its symmetry features, which is useful for understanding the interplay between different levels of structure in many-body quantum systems. The effect of the quantum field on the system is derived via the influence functional and the correlation functions are obtained from the solutions of the evolutionary operator of the reduced density matrix. They are then used to construct the covariance matrix, which forms the basis for our analysis of the structure of quantum entanglement in this open system. To make the physical features explicit, we consider a system of three quantum coupled oscillators placed at the vertices of an equilateral triangle with disparate pairwise couplings. We analyze the entanglement between one oscillator and the other two with equal (symmetric) and unequal (asymmetric) coupling strengths. As a physical illustration, we apply the results for these two different configurations to address some basic issues in macroscopic quantum phenomena from the quantum entanglement perspective.

TI Acoustic wave-based single photon shifter for solid-state sources
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB Controlling the frequency of nonclassical light is essential for the implementation of quantum computation, communication, and the integration of various quantum systems. However, there is a practical absence of easy -to -integrate frequency -shift devices for solid-state single -photon sources. Here, we propose an integrated single -photon frequency shifter that utilizes acousto-optic modulation. The device is composed of two interdigital transducers (IDTs) for generating acoustic waves on a lithium niobate on insulator (LNOI) platform, along with a silicon waveguide that is periodically positioned at the nodes of the acoustic wave to enhance the interaction length. We achieved a low half -wavelength voltage length product V pi x L of 0.18 V cm. With a driving frequency of 129.7 MHz and a driving voltage of 10 V, a frequency shift of up to +/- 405 GHz is realized with near -unity conversion efficiency. Our findings illustrate the feasibility of deterministic on -chip quantum spectral control, which is pivotal for constructing hybrid quantum networks.

TI On-demand quantum light sources for underwater communications
SO MATERIALS FOR QUANTUM TECHNOLOGY
AB Quantum communication has been at the forefront of modern research for decades, however it is severely hampered in underwater applications, where the properties of water absorb nearly all useful optical wavelengths and prevent them from propagating more than, in most cases, a few metres. This research reports on-demand quantum light sources, suitable for underwater optical communication. The single photon emitters, which can be engineered using an electron beam, are based on impurities in hexagonal boron nitride. They have a zero phonon line at similar to 436 nm, near the minimum value of water absorption and are shown to suffer negligible transmission and purity loss when travelling through water channels. These emitters are also shown to possess exceptional underwater transmission properties compared to emitters at other optical wavelengths and are utilised in a completely secure quantum key distribution experiment with rates of kbits s-1.

TI Enhancing the reliability of multipath QKD over multi-band systems
SO JOURNAL OF OPTICAL COMMUNICATIONS AND NETWORKING
AB Quantum key distribution (QKD) networks offer scalable secure communication, while efficient integration with existing optical infrastructure requires careful consideration. This paper investigates enhancing the security of multipath QKD over multi-band systems by exploring the trade-offs between multi-band separation and multipath techniques. A novel, to our knowledge, framework, incorporating blocking ratio analysis for a single and multipath QKD, is proposed, comparing bitwise product and concatenated key generation methods. Our model considers propagation delays and key pool synchronization's impact on the secret key rate (SKR). Our simulations using a U.S. long-haul network model demonstrate significant benefits of implementing QKD in alternative spectral bands. The results show substantial improvements in SKR at various span lengths in single-path scenarios. Additionally, increasing the number of quantum channels led to noticeable reductions in network blocking rates, enabling higher classical traffic loads throughout the network infrastructure. We introduce, to our knowledge, new KPIs: the blocking rate (B-CQ) and a comprehensive security rate (C), assessing the final key's overall secrecy. For multipath schemes, simulations reveal that concatenated multipath QKD, while exhibiting a superior blocking rate, showed 12% less compromised secrecy at 4000 km (32% to 20%), compared to less than 10% for bitwise product multipath QKD under the same conditions. These findings provide valuable insights into designing efficient and secure quantum-enhanced optical networks, highlighting the complex interplay between security and efficiency in multipath QKD architectures.

TI Making Use of Low-Cost High-Pressure-High-Temperature-Diamond Materials

SO PHYSICA STATUS SOLIDI A-APPLICATIONS AND MATERIALS SCIENCE
AB A cost-effective approach to provide diamond platelets containing nitrogen vacancy center ensembles (NVs) in the range of ppm is investigated. Industry-type high-pressure-high-temperature-diamond type 1b containing a high number of interstitial nitrogen in the range of several tens of ppm are used and small diamond platelets (size approximate to 1 x 1 mm2, thickness approximate to 300 mu m) are prepared by laser cutting and polishing. The nitrogen is converted into NV by means of high-energy electron irradiation of 10 MeV and annealing at 900 degrees C. Variations in the irradiation dose between 0.5E18 1/cm2 and 2E18 1/cm2 result in different densities of NV. The diamond platelets are analyzed with regard to their nitrogen concentration and photoluminescence as well as optically detected magnetic resonance is used to investigate the usability for a NV-based magnetometer. A method to calculate the ratio of negatively to neutrally charged NV (NV-/NV0) is proposed that uses the photoluminescence intensities of the spectrum at 575 and 638 nm, namely, the zero-phonon lines of NV- and NV0.

TI Entanglement and quantum tomography with top quarks at the LHC
SO EUROPEAN PHYSICAL JOURNAL PLUS
AB Entanglement is a central subject in quantum mechanics. Due to its genuine relativistic behavior and fundamental nature, high-energy colliders are attractive systems for the experimental study of fundamental aspects of quantum mechanics. We propose the detection of entanglement between the spins of top-antitop-quark pairs at the LHC, representing the first proposal of entanglement detection in a pair of quarks, and also the entanglement observation at the highest energy scale so far. We show that entanglement can be observed by direct measurement of the angular separation between the leptons arising from the decay of the top-antitop pair. The detection can be achieved with high statistical significance, using the current data recorded during Run 2 at the LHC. In addition, we develop a simple protocol for the quantum tomography of the top-antitop pair. This experimental technique reconstructs the quantum state of the system, providing a new experimental tool to test theoretical predictions. Our work explicitly implements canonical experimental techniques in quantum information in a two-qubit high-energy system, paving the way to use high-energy colliders to also study quantum information aspects.

TI Direct Fidelity Estimation of Quantum States Using Machine Learning
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB In almost all quantum applications, one of the key steps is to verify that the fidelity of the prepared quantum state meets expectations. In this Letter, we propose a new approach solving this problem using machine-learning techniques. Compared to other fidelity estimation methods, our method is applicable to arbitrary quantum states, the number of required measurement settings is small, and this number does not increase with the size of the system. For example, for a general five-qubit quantum state, only four measurement settings are required to predict its fidelity with +/- 1% precision in a nonadversarial scenario. This machine-learning-based approach for estimating quantum state fidelity has the potential to be widely used in the field of quantum information.

TI Optimality of the pretty good measurement for port-based teleportation
SO LETTERS IN MATHEMATICAL PHYSICS
AB Port-based teleportation (PBT) is a protocol in which Alice teleports an unknown quantum state to Bob using measurements on a shared entangled multipartite state called the port state and forward classical communication. In this paper, we give an explicit proof that the so-called pretty good measurement, or square-root measurement, is optimal for the PBT protocol with independent copies of maximally entangled states as the port state. We then show that the very same measurement remains optimal even when the port state is optimized to yield the best possible PBT protocol. Hence, there is one particular pretty good measurement achieving the optimal performance in both cases. The following well-known facts are key ingredients in the proofs of these results: (i) the natural symmetries of PBT, leading to a description in terms of representation-theoretic data; (ii) the operational equivalence of PBT with certain state discrimination problems, which allows us to employ duality of the associated semidefinite programs. Along the way, we rederive the representation-theoretic formulas for the performance of PBT protocols proved in Studzinski et al. (Sci Rep 7(1):1-11, 2017) and Mozrzymas et al. (N J Phys 20(5):053006, 2018) using only standard techniques from the representation theory of the unitary and symmetric groups. Providing a simplified derivation of these beautiful formulas is one of the main goals of this paper.

TI Dynamic secret-key provisioning in quantum-secured passive optical
   networks (PONs)
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB Quantum cryptography (QC) is currently under investigation to build highly secure optical communication networks. QC requires distribution of quantum keys (also called "secret" keys) on separate wavelength channels than those used to transmit the encrypted data. Hence, we propose a quantum-secured passive optical network (QS-PON) that supports both i) the traditional wavelength channels for secured data transmission, and ii) a quantum key distribution network (QKDN) running on separate dedicated wavelengths. The QKDN generates and stores secret keys that are then assigned to users' demands served on traditional PON channels. To generate secret keys, quantum transmitters at the optical network units (ONUs) exchange qubits with a quantum receiver at the optical line terminal (OLT). Then, the generated secret keys are stored in quantum key pools (QKPs) installed at both OLT and the ONUs and assigned to users' demands. Point-to-multipoint QKD systems have been experimentally demonstrated over various forms of quantum access networks (QANs), showing that an efficient mechanism to generate and assign quantum keys based on traffic requests is a critical component of QANs. In this study, we present a new QS-PON architecture, and we propose a dynamic secret-key provisioning (DSKP) algorithm that effectively generates and assigns secret keys from users' demands. Our proposed DSKP algorithm features two phases, the lowest-first secret-key generation (LF-SKG) phase and the hierarchical-clustering secret-key consumption (HC-SKC) phase. In this study, we also provide an analytical model that describes how secret keys are generated and consumed in QICPs. In our illustrative numerical evaluation, we compare our algorithm for secret-key provisioning with a baseline IPACT-based solution in terms of service-rejection ratio, time-slot utilization, and guard- and relay-time saving. Results show that DSKP reduces service-rejection ratio and guard- and relay-time of about 16% and 39.54%, respectively.

TI Blueprint for a High-Performance Fluxonium Quantum Processor
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB Transforming stand-alone qubits into a functional, general-purpose quantum processing unit requires an architecture where many-body quantum entanglement can be generated and controlled in a coherent, modular, and measurable fashion. Electronic circuits promise a well-developed pathway for large-scale integration once a mature library of quantum-compatible elements have been developed. In the domain of superconducting circuits, fluxonium has recently emerged as a promising qubit due to its high-coherence and large anharmonicity, yet its scalability has not been systematically explored. In this work, we present a blueprint for a high-performance fluxonium-based quantum processor that addresses the challenges of frequency crowding, and both quantum and classical crosstalk. The main ingredients of this architecture include high-anharmonicity circuits, multipath couplers to entangle qubits where spurious longitudinal coupling can be nulled, circuit designs that are compatible with multiplexed microwave circuitry, and strongly coupled readout channels that do not require complex, frequency-sculpted elements to maintain coherence. In addition, we explore robust and resource-efficient protocols for quantum logical opera-tions, then perform numerical simulations to validate the expected performance of this proposed processor with respect to gate fidelity, fabrication yield, and logical error suppression. Lastly, we discuss practical considerations to implement the architecture and achieve the anticipated performance.

Each Hermitian LCD code can give an entanglement-assisted quantum error-correcting code (EAQECC) with maximal entanglement. Methods of constructing Hermitian LCD codes from known codes were developed, and seven new Hermitian LCD codes with parameters [119, 4, 88]4, [123, 4, 91]4, [124, 4, 92]4, [136, 4, 101]4, [140, 4, 104]4, [188, 4, 140]4 and [212, 4, 158]4 were constructed. Seven families of Hermitian LCD codes and their related EAQECCs were derived from these codes. These new EAQECCs have better parameters than those known in the literature.

TI Direct measurement of nonlocal interactions in the many-body localized
   phase
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB The interplay of interactions and strong disorder can lead to an exotic quantum many-body localized (MBL) phase of matter. Beyond the absence of transport, the MBL phase has distinctive signatures, such as slow dephasing and logarithmic entanglement growth; they commonly result in slow and subtle modifications of the dynamics, rendering their measurement challenging. Here, we experimentally characterize these properties of the MBL phase in a system of coupled superconducting qubits. By implementing phase sensitive techniques, we map out the structure of local integrals of motion in the MBL phase. Tomographic reconstruction of single and two-qubit density matrices allows us to determine the spatial and temporal entanglement growth between the localized sites. In addition, we study the preservation of entanglement in the MBL phase. The interferometric protocols implemented here detect affirmative quantum correlations and exclude artifacts due to the imperfect isolation of the system. By measuring elusive MBL quantities, our work highlights the advantages of phase sensitive measurements in studying novel phases of matter.

TI Electrons in Quantum Dots on Helium: From Charge Qubits to Synthetic
   Color Centers
SO ENTROPY
AB Electrons trapped above the surface of helium provide a means to study many-body physics free from the randomness that comes from defects in other condensed-matter systems. Localizing an electron in an electrostatic quantum dot makes its energy spectrum discrete, with controlled level spacing. The lowest two states can act as charge qubit states. In this paper, we study how the coupling to the quantum field of capillary waves on helium-known as ripplons-affects electron dynamics. As we show, the coupling can be strong. This bounds the parameter range where electron-based charge qubits can be implemented. The constraint is different from the conventional relaxation time constraint. The electron-ripplon system in a dot is similar to a color center formed by an electron defect coupled to phonons in a solid. In contrast to solids, the coupling in the electron on helium system can be varied from strong to weak. This enables a qualitatively new approach to studying color center physics. We analyze the spectroscopy of the pertinent synthetic color centers in a broad range of the coupling strength.

TI On Optimal and Quantum Code Construction from Cyclic Codes over

AB The key objective of this paper is to study the cyclic codes over mixed alphabets on the structure of F(q)PQ, where P=Fq[v](sic)v(3)-a(2)(2)v? and Q=Fq[u,v](sic)u(2)-a(1)(2),v(3)-a(2)(2)v? are nonchain finite rings and ai is in Fq/{0} for i?{1,2}, where q=p(m) with m=1 is a positive integer and p is an odd prime. Moreover, with the applications, we obtain better and new quantum error-correcting (QEC) codes. For another application over the ring P, we obtain several optimal codes with the help of the Gray image of cyclic codes.

TI CONSTRUCTIONS OF BINARY QUANTUM CSS-T CODES FROM SOME SPECIAL FUNCTIONS
SO ADVANCES IN MATHEMATICS OF COMMUNICATIONS
AB Transversal T gates, which are seen as the most common non-Clifford gates, are an essential component of the universal set for fault tolerance. CSS-T codes are proposed to reduce the cost of implementing logical non-Clifford gates. So far, there have been limited studies on CSS-T codes. In this paper, we proposed new constructions of binary quantum CSS-T codes from four classes of special functions. Our constructions are based on a general construction of linear codes over the finite field F2, and we prove that such a pair of codes is actually a CSS-T pair under the given conditions. The resulting CSS-T codes are new compared with these codes in the literature.

TI A type I approximation of the crossed product
SO JOURNAL OF HIGH ENERGY PHYSICS
AB I show that an analog of the crossed product construction that takes type III1 algebras to type II algebras exists also in the type I case. This is particularly natural when the local algebra is a non-trivial direct sum of type I factors. Concretely, I rewrite the usual type I trace in a different way and renormalise it. This new renormalised trace stays well-defined even when each factor is taken to be type III. I am able to recover both type II infinity as well as type II1 algebras by imposing different constraints on the central operator in the code. An example of this structure appears in holographic quantum error-correcting codes; the central operator is then the area operator.

TI Single-shot analysis of amplified correlated light
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB Correlated beams are important in classical and quantum communication as well as other technologies. However, classical amplifiers, which are essential for long transmission of correlated beams, degrade the correlation due to noise and due to the amplifier spectral response. We measure, with a novel high resolution single-shot measurement system, the impact of amplifiers on correlated beams. We develop a new method for analyzing the correlation between the signal and idler beams by choosing peaks in the pulses according to their power levels. We demonstrate how to tailor the correlation after the amplifier to obtain either higher or lower correlation. Our research may influence the future use of amplifiers in non-classical communication systems as well as the transmission of quantum information over long distances.

TI Circuit cutting with classical side information
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Circuit cutting is a technique for simulating large quantum circuits by partitioning them into smaller subcircuits, which can be executed on smaller quantum devices. The results from these subcircuits are then combined in classical postprocessing to accurately reconstruct the expectation value of the original circuit. Circuit cutting introduces a sampling overhead that grows exponentially with the number of gates and qubit wires that are cut. Many recently developed quasiprobabilistic circuit cutting techniques leverage classical side information, obtained from intermediate measurements within the subcircuits, to enhance the postprocessing step. In this work, we provide a formalization of general circuit cutting techniques utilizing side information through quantum instruments. With this framework, we analyze the advantage that classical side information provides in reducing the sampling overhead of circuit cutting. Surprisingly, we find that in certain scenarios, side information does not yield any reduction in sampling overhead, whereas in others it is essential for circuit cutting to be feasible at all. Furthermore, we present a lower bound for the optimal sampling overhead with side information that can be evaluated efficiently via semidefinite programming and improves on all previously known lower bounds.

TI Coherent Spin Control of Single Molecules on a Surface
SO ACS NANO
AB Control of single electron spins constitutes one of the most promising platforms for spintronics, quantum sensing, and quantum information processing. Utilizing single molecular magnets as their hosts establishes an interesting framework since their molecular structure is highly flexible and chemistry-based large-scale synthesis directly provides a way toward scalability. Here, we demonstrate coherent spin manipulation of single molecules on a surface, which we control individually using a scanning tunneling microscope in combination with electron spin resonance. We previously found that iron phthalocyanine (FePc) molecules form a spin-1/2 system when placed on an insulating thin film of magnesium oxide (MgO). Performing Rabi oscillation and Hahn echo measurements, we show that the FePc spin can be coherently manipulated with a phase coherence time T-2(Echo) of several hundreds of nanoseconds. Tunneling current-dependent measurements demonstrate that interaction with the tunneling electrons is the dominating source of decoherence. In addition, we perform Hahn echo measurements on small self-assembled arrays of FePc molecules. We show that, despite additional intermolecular magnetic coupling, spin resonance and T-2(Echo) are much less perturbed by T-1 spin flip events of neighboring spins than by the tunneling current. This will potentially allow for individual addressable molecular spins in self-assemblies and with application for quantum information processing.

TI Simulating open quantum systems with giant atoms
SO QUANTUM SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB Open quantum many-body systems are of both fundamental and applicational interest. However, it remains an open challenge to simulate and solve such systems, both with state-of-the-art classical methods and with quantum-simulation protocols. To overcome this challenge, we introduce a simulator for open quantum many-body systems based on giant atoms, i.e. atoms (possibly artificial), that couple to a waveguide at multiple points, which can be wavelengths apart. We first show that a simulator consisting of two giant atoms can simulate the dynamics of two coupled qubits, where one qubit is subject to different drive amplitudes and dissipation rates. This simulation enables characterizing the quantum Zeno crossover in this model. We further show that by equipping the simulator with post-selection, it becomes possible to simulate the effective non-Hermitian Hamiltonian dynamics of the system and thereby characterize the transition from oscillatory to non-oscillatory dynamics due to varying dissipation rates. We demonstrate and analyze the robustness of these simulation results against noise affecting the giant atoms. Finally, we discuss and show how giant-atom-based simulators can be scaled up for digital-analog simulation of large open quantum many-body systems, e.g. generic dissipative spin models.

TI Time-bin entanglement at telecom wavelengths from a hybrid photonic

SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB Mass-deployable implementations for quantum communication require compact, reliable, and low-cost hardware solutions for photon generation, control and analysis. We present a fiber-pigtailed hybrid photonic circuit comprising nonlinear waveguides for photon-pair generation and a polymer interposer reaching 68 dB of pump suppression and photon separation based on a polarizing beam splitter with > 25 dB polarization extinction ratio. The optical stability of the hybrid assembly enhances the quality of the entanglement, and the efficient background suppression and photon routing further reduce accidental coincidences. We thus achieve a (96 (+ 3 )(- 8 ))% concurrence and a (96 (- 5) (+ 2) () )% fidelity to a Bell state. The generated telecom-wavelength, time-bin entangled photon pairs are ideally suited for distributing Bell pairs over fiber networks with low dispersion.

TI Classical-quantum approach to image classification: Autoencoders and
   quantum SVMs
SO AVS QUANTUM SCIENCE
AB In order to leverage quantum computers for machine learning tasks such as image classification, consideration is required. Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) computers have limitations that include noise, scalability, read-in and read-out times, and gate operation times. Therefore, strategies should be devised to mitigate the impact complex datasets that can have on the overall efficiency of a quantum machine learning pipeline. This may otherwise lead to excessive resource demands or noise. We apply a classical feature extraction using a ResNet10-inspired convolutional autoencoder to reduce dataset dimensionality and extract abstract, meaningful features before feeding them into a quantum layer. The chosen quantum layer is a quantum-enhanced support vector machine (QSVM), as SVMs typically do not require large sample sizes to identify patterns in data and have short-depth quantum circuits, which limits the impact of noise. The autoencoder is trained to extract meaningful features through image reconstruction, aiming to minimize the mean squared error across a training set of images. We use three datasets to illustrate the pipeline: HTRU-1, MNIST, and CIFAR-10. We include a quantum-enhanced one-class support vector machine (QOCSVM) for the highly unbalanced HTRU-1 set, with classical machine learning results for comparison. HTRU-2 is also included to serve as a benchmark for a dataset with meaningful features. The autoencoder achieved near-perfect reconstruction and high accuracy for MNIST, while CIFAR-10 showed poorer performance due to image complexity, and HTRU-1 struggled due to the imbalance in the dataset. The varying performance across datasets highlights the need to balance dimensionality reduction and prediction performance using quantum methods. (c) 2025 Author(s).

TI Dissipative optomechanics in high-frequency nanomechanical resonators
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB The coherent transduction of information between microwave and optical domains is a fundamental building block for future quantum networks. A promising way to bridge these widely different frequencies is using high-frequency nanomechanical resonators interacting with low-loss optical modes. State-of-the-art optomechanical devices rely on purely dispersive interactions that are enhanced by a large photon population in the cavity. Additionally, one could use dissipative optomechanics, where photons can be scattered directly from a waveguide into a resonator hence increasing the degree of control of the acousto-optic interplay. Hitherto, such dissipative optomechanical interaction was only demonstrated at low mechanical frequencies, precluding prominent applications such as the quantum state transfer between photonic and phononic domains. Here, we show the first dissipative optomechanical system operating in the sideband-resolved regime, where the mechanical frequency is larger than the optical linewidth. Exploring this unprecedented regime, we demonstrate the impact of dissipative optomechanical coupling in reshaping both mechanical and optical spectra. Our figures represent a two-order-of-magnitude leap in the mechanical frequency and a tenfold increase in the dissipative optomechanical coupling rate compared to previous works. Further advances could enable the individual addressing of mechanical modes and help mitigate optical nonlinearities and absorption in optomechanical devices.

TI Importance of temperature dependence of interface traps in high-k metal
   gate stacks for silicon spin-qubit development
SO APPLIED PHYSICS LETTERS
AB While semiconductor-based spin qubits have demonstrated promising fidelities exceeding 99.9%, their coherence time is limited by the presence of charge noise. However, fast process optimization for reduced charge noise becomes challenging due to the time-consuming nature of cryogenic measurements. Hence, this work explores low frequency analysis methods to determine interface trap densities, their temperature dependence, and correlation with observed noise levels. The herein presented results provide evidence for strong temperature dependence of the interface trap density. Moreover, good agreement is observed between charge pumping and conductance-based methods. Finally, differences in temperature dependent trends of flicker noise are observed, indicating additional influences, which need to be considered for further device optimization.

TI Spin-valley locked excited states spectroscoy in a one-particle bilayer
   graphene quantum dot
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Current semiconductor qubits rely either on the spin or on the charge degree of freedom to encode quantum information. By contrast, in bilayer graphene the valley degree of freedom, stemming from the crystal lattice symmetry, is a robust quantum number that can therefore be harnessed for this purpose. The simplest implementation of a valley qubit would rely on two states with opposite valleys as in the case of a single-carrier bilayer graphene quantum dot immersed in a small perpendicular magnetic field (B perpendicular to less than or similar to 100 mT). However, the single-carrier quantum dot excited states spectrum has not been resolved to date in the relevant magnetic field range. Here, we fill this gap, by measuring the parallel and perpendicular magnetic field dependence of this spectrum with an unprecedented resolution of 4 mu eV. We use a time-resolved charge detection technique that gives us access to individual tunnel events. Our results come as a direct verification of the predicted spectrum and establish a new upper-bound on inter-valley mixing, equal to our energy resolution. Our charge detection technique opens the door to measuring the relaxation time of a valley qubit in a single-carrier bilayer graphene quantum dot.
   A single electron quantum dot in bilayer graphene is a candidate for a spin-valley qubit, however its excited state spectrum has not been determined under relevant conditions. Here the authors accomplish this using time-resolved charge detection technique and set the new upper bound on the inter-valley mixing.

TI Manipulation of Majorana-Kramers qubit and its tolerance in
   time-reversal invariant topological superconductor
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
AB We investigate non-Abelian statistics of Majorana-Kramers pairs (MKPs) in a network system of onedimensional time-reversal invariant topological superconductors by using numerical simulations of braiding dynamics and examine the tolerance against various perturbations which may cause decoherence of MKPs. We, first, consider effects of a magnetic field which breaks time-reversal symmetry. In contrast to a naive expectation, the non-Abelian braiding of MKPs is robust against applied magnetic fields provided that the initial and final states of a braiding process are invariant under the combination of a time reversal and a mirror reflection, even when intermediate states break the combined symmetry. Second, we investigate the stability of non-Abelian braidings in the case with gate-induced inhomogeneous potentials at junctions between superconducting nanowires, which generally generate a non-Majorana nearly zero-energy Andreeev bound state at the junctions. It is found that the non-Majorana nearly zero-energy states interfere with MKPs, resulting in the failure of non-Abelian braidings, when the length scale of the inhomogeneous potentials is comparable to the coherence length of the superconductors.

TI Spectral tuning and nanoscale localization of single color centers in
   silicon via controllable strain
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB The development of color centers in silicon enables scalable quantum technologies by combining telecom-wavelength emission and compatibility with mature silicon fabrication. However, large-scale integration requires precise control of each emitter's optical transition to generate indistinguishable photons for quantum networking. Here, we demonstrate a foundry-fabricated photonic integrated circuit (PIC) combining suspended silicon waveguides with a microelectromechanical (MEMS) cantilever to apply local strain and spectrally tune individual G-centers. Applying up to 35 V between the cantilever and the substrate induces a reversible wavelength shift of the zero-phonon line exceeding 100 pm, with no loss in brightness. Moreover, by modeling the strain-induced shifts with a digital twin physical model, we achieve vertical localization of color centers with sub-3 nm vertical resolution, directly correlating their spatial position, dipole orientation, and spectral behavior. This method enables on-demand, low-power control of emission spectrum and nanoscale localization of color centers, advancing quantum networks on a foundry-compatible platform.

TI Generation and engineering of orbital angular momentum biphotons in
   optical fibers
SO OPTICA QUANTUM
AB In the realm of quantum information processing, harnessing high-dimensional photonic systems provides a pathway to overcome limitations of traditional two-level systems. Orbital angular momentum (OAM) of light has emerged as a powerful tool for creating and manipulating high-dimensional entanglement, promising increased information capacity and enhanced security in quantum communication protocols. However, conventional methods like spontaneous parametric downconversion encounter challenges due to non-uniform production rates of Laguerre-Gaussian modes. This study explores the potential of spontaneous four-wave mixing in ring-core fibers (RCFs) as a viable platform for generating OAM photon pairs with tailored spectral and spatial properties. We show that by controlling the topological charge of pump photons, correlated, uncorrelated, and anti-correlated photon pairs can be engineered across arbitrary spectral ranges, essential for diverse quantum applications. Experimental noise characterization of the RCF-based source demonstrates a high coincidence-to-accidental ratio exceeding 4000, and a low heralded second-order correlation function (g(H)((2)) < 0.005), which confirms its operation well into the single-photon regime. This work demonstrates the potential of RCFs as a versatile platform for generating structured photon pairs, paving the way for future high-dimensional quantum communication and information processing applications.

TI Efficient implementation of quantum signal processing via the
   adiabatic-impulse model
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB We investigate an analogy between quantum signal processing (QSP) and the adiabatic-impulse model (AIM) in order to implement the QSP algorithm with fast quantum logic gates. QSP is an algorithmic technique that uses single-qubit dynamics to perform a polynomial function transformation. The adiabatic-impulse model effectively describes the evolution of a two-level quantum system under a strong external driving field. We can map parameters from QSP to the AIM to implement a QSP-like evolution with nonadiabatic, high-amplitude external drives. By choosing the AIM driving parameters that control the nonadiabatic transition parameters (such as driving amplitude A, frequency omega, and signal timing), one can achieve polynomial approximations and increase robustness in quantum circuits. The analogy between QSP and AIM presented here can be useful as a way to directly implement the QSP algorithmic technique on quantum systems and show the benefits from fast Landau-Zener-St & uuml;ckelberg-Majorana (LZSM) quantum logic gates in comparison with usual resonance driving gates in IBM-Q quantum processors.

TI Ultra-narrow-linewidth hybrid-integrated self-injection locked laser at
   780 nm
SO OPTICA
AB Narrow-linewidth lasers are essential across a wide range of applications, including classical and quantum sensing, trapped ion systems, position/navigation/timing systems, optical clocks, and microwave frequency synthesizers. In the visible and near-visible spectrum, low-noise lasers are particularly important for laser trapping and cooling techniques, which are vital for trapped ion quantum computing, sensing, and atomic clocks. In this context, our work showcases a hybrid-integrated narrow-linewidth laser that operates at 780 nm, achieving a self-heterodyne linewidth of 105 Hz. To validate the experimental results, we performed a numerical analysis that combines insights from a many-body theory applied to the gain region with a travelling-wave model to capture the laser dynamics. Our investigation further delves into how the linewidth of the self-injection locked lasers is influenced by the parameters of micro-ring resonators, aiming to assess the potential for achieving Hz-level integrated laser linewidths at 780 nm. This work not only demonstrates the technical feasibility of Hz-level narrow-linewidth lasers but also lays the groundwork for future explorations in the field.

TI Resonant Excitation and Purcell Enhancement of Coherent Nitrogen-Vacancy
   Centers Coupled to a Fabry-Perot Microcavity
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW APPLIED
AB The nitrogen-vacancy (N -V) center in diamond has been established as a prime building block for quantum networks. However, scaling beyond a few network nodes is currently limited by low spin-photon entanglement rates, resulting from the N -V center?s low probability of coherent photon emission and collection. Integration into a cavity can boost both values via the Purcell effect, but poor optical coherence of near-surface N -V centers has so far prevented their resonant optical control, as would be required for entanglement generation. Here, we overcome this challenge, and demonstrate resonant addressing of individual, fiber-cavity-coupled N -V centers, and collection of their Purcell-enhanced coherent photon emission. Utilizing off-resonant and resonant addressing protocols, we extract an enhancement of the zero-phonon line emission by a factor of up to 4, consistent with a detailed theoretical model. This model predicts that the probability of coherent photon detection per optical excitation can be increased to 10% for realistic parameters?an improvement over state-of-the art solid immersion lens collection systems by 2 orders of magnitude. The resonant operation of an improved optical interface for single coherent quantum emitters in a closed-cycle cryogenic system at T ? 4 K is an important result towards extensive quantum networks with long coherence.

TI Preparations for quantum simulations of quantum chromodynamics in 1+1
   dimensions. II. Single-baryon ?-decay in real time
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW D
AB A framework for quantum simulations of real-time weak decays of hadrons and nuclei in a two-flavor lattice theory in one spatial dimension is presented. A single generation of the Standard Model is found to require 16 qubits per spatial lattice site after mapping to spin operators via the Jordan-Wigner transformation. Both quantum chromodynamics and flavor-changing weak interactions are included in the dynamics, the latter through four-Fermi effective operators. Quantum circuits that implement time evolution in this lattice theory are developed and run on Quantinuum's H1-1 20-qubit trapped ion system to simulate the fi-decay of a single baryon on one lattice site. These simulations include the initial state preparation and are performed for both one and two Trotter time steps. The potential intrinsic error -correction properties of this type of lattice theory are discussed, and the leading lattice Hamiltonian required to simulate 0vfifi-decay of nuclei induced by a neutrino Majorana mass term is provided.

TI Ion shuttling method for long-range shuttling of trapped ions in
   MEMS-fabricated ion traps
SO JAPANESE JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYSICS
AB A large-scale ion trap array fabricated using the microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) technology is expected to be a promising device for building a practical quantum computer. Shuttling trapped ions is essential for operating scalable ion trap structures. This paper proposes an ion shuttling method for a MEMS-fabricated surface ion trap. Change of secular frequency of trapping potential can cause heating and subsequent loss of ions. Therefore, direct current voltage sets to form uniform ion trapping potentials around the ions while shuttling are calculated by simulations. A 32-channel digital-to-analog converter system is developed to apply the calculated voltage sets to the electrodes of the MEMS-fabricated surface ion trap. The shuttling process is experimented using trapped Yb-174(+) ions. The successful round trip of the ion for 1920 mu m is demonstrated using the developed approach.

SO IET QUANTUM COMMUNICATION
AB Quantum computing and deep learning have recently gained popularity across various industries, promising revolutionary advancements. The authors introduce QC-PCSANN-CHIO-FD, a novel approach that enhances fault detection in electrical power systems by combining quantum computing, deep learning, and optimisation algorithms. The network, based on a Pyramidal Convolution Shuffle Attention Neural Network (PCSANN) optimised with the Coronavirus Herd Immunity Optimiser, shows promising results. Initially, historical datasets are used for fault detection. Preprocessing, which includes handling missing data and outliers using Adaptive Variational Bayesian Filtering is followed by Dual-Domain Feature Extraction to extract grayscale statistical features. These features are processed by PCSANN to detect faults. The Coronavirus Herd Immunity Optimisation Algorithm is proposed to optimise PCSANN for precise fault detection. Performance of the proposed QC-PCSANN-CHIO-FD approach attains 24.11%, 28.56% and 22.73% high specificity, 21.89%, 23.04% and 9.51% lower computation Time, 25.289%, 15.35% and 19.91% higher ROC and 8.65%, 13.8%, and 7.15% higher Accuracy compared with existing methods, such as combining deep learning based on quantum computing for electrical power system malfunction diagnosis (QC-ANN-FD), electrical power system fault diagnostics using hybrid quantum-classical deep learning (QC-CRBM-FD), applications of machine learning to the identification of power system faults: Recent developments and future directions (QC-RF-FD).

TI Conditional entanglement transfer via black holes: restoring
   predictability
SO NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB Hawking's black hole evaporation process suggests that we may need to choose between quantum unitarity and other basic physical principles such as no-signaling, entanglement monogamy, and the equivalence principle. We here show that the Hawking's quantum model for the black hole evaporation is consistent with the above fundamental principles. Our analysis does not involve exotic new physics, but rather uses standard quantum theory, general relativity, and the Einstein-Hilbert action including matter. We explicitly show that the whole state consisting of matter and radiation (in a joint superposition of different energy states) is pure at any stage of the evaporation process, including the particular case of 0 mass. Moreover, after full evaporation the state for radiation at infinity is pure and in one-to-one correspondence with the initial state forming the black hole. Thus there is no information loss upon full evaporation according to the quantum information theory. The original entanglement of the black hole matter (if any) gets transferred to the outgoing particles via a process similar to entanglement swapping, without violation of causality (as proved explicitly). On the other hand, if the initial state is a tensor product state, the entanglement of Hawking particles, present in the intermediate phase, is broken when the black hole evaporates completely. Therefore, the final state (entangled or tensor product depending on the nature of initial state) after the full black hole evaporation is pure without loss of information.

TI Revealing inherent quantum interference and entanglement of a Dirac
   particle
SO NPJ QUANTUM INFORMATION
AB Although originally predicted in relativistic quantum mechanics, Zitterbewegung can also appear in some classical systems, which leads to the important question of whether Zitterbewegung of Dirac particles is underlain by a more fundamental and universal interference behavior without classical analogs. We here reveal such an interference pattern in phase space, which underlies but goes beyond Zitterbewegung, and whose nonclassicality is manifested by the negativity of the phase space quasiprobability distribution, and the associated pseudospin-momentum entanglement. We confirm this discovery by numerical simulation and an on-chip experiment, where a superconducting qubit and a quantized microwave field respectively emulate the internal and external degrees of freedom of a Dirac particle. The measured quasiprobability negativities agree well with the numerical simulation. Besides being of fundamental importance, the demonstrated nonclassical effects are useful in quantum technology.

TI Physics-based representations for machine learning properties of
   chemical reactions
SO MACHINE LEARNING-SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB Physics-based representations constructed using only atomic positions and nuclear charges (also known as quantum machine learning, QML) allow for the reliable and efficient inference of molecular properties from training data. Chemistry is a science rooted in chemical reactions, naturally involving multiple molecular species. Here, we extend QML's capabilities to include the prediction of reaction properties by defining reaction representations: representations taking as input multiple molecules participating in a reaction, each represented by their corresponding atomic charges and three-dimensional coordinates. Several reaction representations are constructed from established molecular ones and benchmarked on four datasets representative of thermodynamic or kinetic reaction properties. One of these, the Hydroform-22-TS dataset (2350 energy barriers), is introduced as part of this work. The relevant ingredients for a high-performing reaction representation are extracted and used to construct the Bond-Based Reaction Representation ((BR2)-R-2) for the prediction of quantum-chemical properties of chemical reactions. Finally, variations of (BR2)-R-2 with varying representation size vs. performance are provided.

TI Photoneutralization of charges in GaAs quantum dot based entangled
   photon emitters
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
AB Semiconductor-based emitters of pairwise photonic entanglement are a promising constituent of photonic quantum technologies. They are known for the ability to generate discrete photonic states on-demand with low multiphoton emission, near-unity entanglement fidelity, and high single photon indistinguishability. However, quantum dots typically suffer from luminescence blinking, lowering the efficiency of the source and hampering their scalable application in quantum networks. In this paper, we investigate and adjust the intermittence of the neutral exciton emission in a GaAs/AlGaAs quantum dot under two-photon resonant excitation of the neutral biexciton. We investigate the spectral and quantum optical response of the quantum dot emission to an additional wavelength tunable gate laser, revealing blinking caused by the intrinsic Coulomb blockade due to charge capture processes. Our finding demonstrates that the emission quenching can be actively suppressed by controlling the balance of free electrons and holes in the vicinity of the quantum dot and thereby significantly increasing the quantum efficiency by 30%.

TI Bayesian optimization for state engineering of quantum gases
SO QUANTUM SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB State engineering of quantum objects is a central requirement for precision sensing and quantum computing implementations. When the quantum dynamics can be described by analytical solutions or simple approximation models, optimal state preparation protocols have been theoretically proposed and experimentally realized. For more complex systems such as interacting quantum gases, simplifying assumptions do not apply anymore and the optimization techniques become computationally impractical. Here, we propose Bayesian optimization based on multi-output Gaussian processes to learn the physical properties of a Bose-Einstein condensate within few simulations only. We evaluate its performance on an optimization study case of diabatically transporting the quantum gas while keeping it in its ground state. Within a few hundred executions, we reach a competitive performance to other protocols. While restricting this benchmark to the well known Thomas-Fermi approximation for straightforward comparisons, we expect a similar performance when employing more complex theoretical models, which would be computationally more challenging, rendering standard optimal control theory protocols impractical. This paves the way for efficient state engineering of complex quantum systems including mixtures of interacting gases or cold molecules.

TI Holographic entropy inequalities and the topology of entanglement wedge
   nesting
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW D
AB We prove two new infinite families of holographic entropy inequalities. A key tool is a graphical arrangement of terms of inequalities that is based on entanglement wedge nesting. It associates the inequalities with tessellations of the torus and the projective plane, which reflect a certain topological aspect of entanglement wedge nesting. The inequalities prove a prior conjecture about the holographic entropy cone. We discuss their relation to black hole physics and differential entropy, and sketch applications to quantum error correction, quantifying randomness of quantum states, and others.

TI Noninvertible Symmetry-Protected Topological Order in a Group-Based
   Cluster State
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW X
AB Despite growing interest in beyond-group symmetries in quantum condensed matter systems, there are relatively few microscopic lattice models explicitly realizing these symmetries, and many phenomena have yet to be studied at the microscopic level. We introduce a one-dimensional stabilizer Hamiltonian composed of group-based Pauli operators whose ground state is a G x Rep(G)-symmetric state: the G-cluster state introduced by Brell [New J. Phys. 17, 023029 (2015)]. We show that this state lies in a symmetry-protected topological (SPT) phase protected by G x Rep(G) symmetry, distinct from the symmetric product state by a duality argument. We identify several signatures of SPT order, namely, protected edge modes, string order parameters, and topological response. We discuss how G-cluster states may be used as a universal resource for measurement-based quantum computation, explicitly working out the case where G is a semidirect product of Abelian groups.

TI Effect of Substituent Location on the Relationship between the
   Transition Dipole Moments, Difference Static Dipole, and Hydrophobicity
   in Squaraine Dyes for Quantum Information Devices
SO MOLECULES
AB Aggregates of organic dyes that exhibit excitonic coupling have a wide array of applications, including medical imaging, organic photovoltaics, and quantum information devices. The optical properties of a dye monomer, as a basis of dye aggregate, can be modified to strengthen excitonic coupling. Squaraine (SQ) dyes are attractive for those applications due to their strong absorbance peak in the visible range. While the effects of substituent types on the optical properties of SQ dyes have been previously examined, the effects of various substituent locations have not yet been investigated. In this study, density functional theory (DFT) and time-dependent density functional theory (TD-DFT) were used to investigate the relationships between SQ substituent location and several key properties of the performance of dye aggregate systems, namely, difference static dipole (Delta d), transition dipole moment (mu), hydrophobicity, and the angle (theta) between Delta d and mu. We found that attaching substituents along the long axis of the dye could increase mu while placement off the long axis was shown to increase Delta d and reduce theta. The reduction in theta is largely due to a change in the direction of Delta d as the direction of mu is not significantly affected by substituent position. Hydrophobicity decreases when electron-donating substituents are located close to the nitrogen of the indolenine ring. These results provide insight into the structure-property relationships of SQ dyes and guide the design of dye monomers for aggregate systems with desired properties and performance.

TI Undecidability of the Spectral Gap
SO FORUM OF MATHEMATICS PI
AB We construct families of translationally invariant, nearest-neighbour Hamiltonians on a 2D square lattice of d-level quantum systems (d constant), for which determining whether the system is gapped or gapless is an undecidable problem. This is true even with the promise that each Hamiltonian is either gapped or gapless in the strongest sense: it is promised to either have continuous spectrum above the ground state in the thermodynamic limit, or its spectral gap is lower-bounded by a constant. Moreover, this constant can be taken equal to the operator norm of the local operator that generates the Hamiltonian (the local interaction strength). The result still holds true if one restricts to arbitrarily small quantum perturbations of classical Hamiltonians. The proof combines a robustness analysis of Robinson's aperiodic tiling, together with tools from quantum information theory: the quantum phase estimation algorithm and the history state technique mapping Quantum Turing Machines to Hamiltonians.

TI Embedding Semiclassical Periodic Orbits into Chaotic Many-Body
   Hamiltonians
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB Protecting coherent quantum dynamics from chaotic environment is key to realizations of fragile manybody phenomena and their applications in quantum technology. We present a general construction that embeds a desired periodic orbit into a family of nonintegrable many-body Hamiltonians, whose dynamics is otherwise chaotic. Our construction is based on time-dependent variational principle that projects quantum dynamics onto a manifold of low-entangled states, and it complements earlier approaches for embedding nonthermal eigenstates, known as quantum many-body scars, into thermalizing spectra. By designing terms that suppress "leakage" of the dynamics outside the variational manifold, we engineer families of Floquet models that host exact scarred dynamics, as we illustrate using a driven AffleckKennedy-Lieb-Tasaki model and a recent experimental realization of scars in a dimerized superconducting qubit chain.

TI Epidemic Healthcare Kiosk: A Social Economic Remote Solution Using IoT
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF E-HEALTH AND MEDICAL COMMUNICATIONS
AB One of the most difficult tasks for the physicians is to analyze, manage, and plan suitable diagnoses and treatments for society, especially in an epidemic situation like Corona virus disease (COVID-19). Hence, the mortality rate shoots up. The ultimate reason for such pathetic situation is due to large mass of people being infected, lack of physicians and testing staff, and the threat of physicians themselves being infected while testing patients. This article proposes a solution to tackle this major issue worldwide. This article portrays the methodology of an IoT-interfaced epidemic healthcare kiosk (EHK)-intelligent monitoring system to plan and manage epidemics. The EHK is a non-invasive data acquisition system that consists of several sensors that can record the physiological measurements of the EHK user. The measured parameters are computed using quantum machine learning techniques. The proposed ideology can reduce the mortality rate, control the epidemic, and moreover, provide safety to citizens and physicians.

TI Broadband Parametric Amplification in DARTWARS
SO JOURNAL OF LOW TEMPERATURE PHYSICS
AB Superconducting parametric amplifiers offer the capability to amplify feeble signals with extremely low levels of added noise, potentially reaching quantum-limited amplification. This characteristic makes them essential components in the realm of high-fidelity quantum computing and serves to propel advancements in the field of quantum sensing. In particular, Traveling-Wave Parametric Amplifiers (TWPAs) may be especially suitable for practical applications due to their multi-Gigahertz amplification bandwidth, a feature lacking in Josephson Parametric Amplifiers (JPAs), despite the latter being a more established technology. This paper presents recent developments of the DARTWARS (Detector Array Readout with Traveling Wave AmplifieRS) project, focusing on the latest prototypes of Kinetic Inductance TWPAs (KITWPAs). The project aims to develop a KITWPA capable of achieving 20 dB of amplification. To enhance the production yield, the first prototypes were fabricated with half the length and expected gain of the final device. In this paper, we present the results of the characterization of one of the half-length prototypes. The measurements revealed an average amplification of approximately 9 dB across a 2 GHz bandwidth for a KITWPA spanning 17 mm in length.

SO RESULTS IN PHYSICS
AB In the framework of time-varying coupling and power-law potentials, we investigate quantum entanglement and quantum Fisher information in a system that consists of a three-level atom interacting with a quantized field. The results illustrate that the quantum entanglement and quantum Fisher information's temporal evolution depend critically on the physical properties of the field and its coupling to the atom. It is noteworthy to notice that the quantifiers are sensitive to the exponent parameter of the potential with and without time-varying coupling. Considerable nonlocal correlation with the accuracy of parameter estimation can be achieved through the proper control of physical parameters.

TI Improving thermal state preparation of Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev model with
   reinforcement learning on quantum hardware
SO MACHINE LEARNING-SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB The Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model, known for its strong quantum correlations and chaotic behavior, serves as a key platform for quantum gravity studies. However, variationally preparing thermal states on near-term quantum processors for large systems (N > 12, where N is the number of Majorana fermions) presents a significant challenge due to the rapid growth in the complexity of parameterized quantum circuits. This paper addresses this challenge by integrating reinforcement learning (RL) with convolutional neural networks, employing an iterative approach to optimize the quantum circuit and its parameters. The refinement process is guided by a composite reward signal derived from entropy and the expectation values of the SYK Hamiltonian. This approach reduces the number of controlled-NOT gates by two orders of magnitude for systems N >= 12 compared to traditional methods like first-order Trotterization. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the RL framework in both noiseless and noisy quantum hardware environments, maintaining high accuracy in thermal state preparation. This work advances a scalable, RL-based framework with applications for quantum gravity studies and out-of-time-ordered thermal correlators computation in quantum many-body systems on near-term quantum hardware. The code is available at solving_SYK_with_RL repository.

TI QUANTUM BATTERY SYSTEMS Analyzing Two-Mode Field Charging, Qubit
   Interactions, and Environmental Influences
SO THERMAL SCIENCE
AB This study investigates the dynamical behaviour of a two-cell (two-atom) quantum battery driven by a two-mode charging field. We explore the influence of varying interaction strengths on the systems' performance. This includes increasing the coupling between cells and charging fields, and cells themselves through a dipole interaction and Ising interaction along the z-axis. Additionally, the impact of environmental effects is examined by incorporating decay terms for both the charging fields and the cells. Our analysis focuses on key performance metrics such as stored energy, average power, ergotropy, energy fluctuations, and quantum speed limit time. The results reveal that the environment negatively impacts stored energy, power, and ergotropy, but leads to higher speed limits. Enhanced coupling between the charging fields and the cells improves the studied correlations, promoting efficient energy transfer and decreasing speed limit time. Increasing the coupling between the cells, either via the dipole or Ising interaction, generally exhibits a similar effect. This involves a decrease in maximum achievable energy storage, accompanied by the emergence of more erratic energy fluctuations.

TI Research on intensity-difference squeezing enhancement of
   phase-sensitive amplifier based on coherent feedback
SO ACTA PHYSICA SINICA
AB The intensity-difference squeezed state is an important concept in quantum optics, which is not only of great significance for fundamental research in quantum physics, but also an important quantum resource in the fields of quantum communication, quantum computing, and quantum precision measurement. The optical parametric amplifier based on atomic four-wave mixing is one of the most effective means to achieve intensitydifference squeezed light. However, due to the absorption loss of atomic vapor in the light field, the output squeezing still needs improving. By feeding the non-classical optical field from the optical parametric amplifier back to the input port, the quantum characteristics of its output optical field can be enhanced. However, the intensity-difference squeezing enhancement from a phase-insensitive amplifier is experimentally realized based on coherent feedback control. The intensity-difference squeezing enhancement of the phase-sensitive amplifier has not been discussed. In this work, a two-port coherent feedback-controlled phase-sensitive amplifier is analyzed theoretically. The dependence of the intensity-difference squeezing, respectively, on the feedback intensity, the intensity gain of the optical parametric amplifier, and the losses of the system are investigated. For the ideal case in which the losses of the system are ignored, infinite squeezing can be achieved by adjusting the strength and phase of feedback. Considering the actual atomic absorption losses, squeezing enhancement can also be achieved over a wide range of intensity gains within a certain feedback intensity range. In addition, the squeezing enhancement is quite efficient for the medium intensity gain range. The intensity-difference squeezing enhancement strongly depends on the absorption loss of atomic vapor. The smaller the absorption loss, the more significant the squeezing enhancement effect is. Furthermore, the experimental feasibility of this scheme is also considered in detail. Our research can provide useful references for achieving high-quality non classical light fields in experiment, which may find applications in quantum information processing and quantum precise measurement.

AB The emergence of quantum computing proposes a revolutionary paradigm that can radically transform numerous scientific and industrial application domains. The ability of quantum computers to scale computations imply better performance and efficiency for certain algorithmic tasks than current computers provide. However, to gain benefit from such improvement, quantum computers must be integrated with existing software systems, a process that is not straightforward. In this paper, we investigate the quantum computing ecosystem and the stake-holders involved in building larger hybrid classical-quantum systems. In addition, we discuss the challenges that are emerging at the horizon as the field of quantum computing becomes more mature.

TI Effects of cosine tapering window on quantum phase estimation
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW D
AB We provide a modification to the quantum phase estimation algorithm (QPEA) [Abrams and Lloyd, Phys. Rev. Lett. 83, 5162 (1999); Cleve et al., Proc. R. Soc. A 454, 339 (1998); Nielsen and Chuang, Quantum computation and quantum information, 2002.] inspired by classical windowing methods for spectral density estimation. From this modification we obtain an upper bound in the cost that implies a cubic improvement with respect to the algorithm's error rate. Numerical evaluation of the costs also demonstrates an improvement. Moreover, with similar techniques, we detail an iterative projective measurement method for ground state preparation that gives an exponential improvement over previous bounds using QPEA. Numerical tests that confirm the expected scaling behavior are also obtained. For these numerical tests we have used a lattice Thirring model as testing ground. Using well-known perturbation theory results, we also show how to more appropriately estimate the cost scaling with respect to state error instead of evolution operator error.

TI Wave Matrix Lindbladization I: Quantum Programs for Simulating Markovian
   Dynamics
SO OPEN SYSTEMS & INFORMATION DYNAMICS
AB Density Matrix Exponentiation is a technique for simulating Hamiltonian dynamics when the Hamiltonian to be simulated is available as a quantum state. In this paper, we present a natural analogue to this technique, for simulating Markovian dynamics governed by the well known Lindblad master equation. For this purpose, we first propose an input model in which a Lindblad operator L is encoded into a quantum state ?. Then, given access to n copies of the state ?, the task is to simulate the corresponding Markovian dynamics for time t. We propose a quantum algorithm for this task, called Wave Matrix Lindbladization, and we also investigate its sample complexity. We show that our algorithm uses n = O(t(2)/??) samples of ? to achieve the target dynamics, with an approximation error of O(??).

TI Symmetric Clifford twirling for cost-optimal quantum error mitigation in
   early FTQC regime
SO NPJ QUANTUM INFORMATION
AB Twirling noise affecting quantum gates is essential in understanding and controlling errors, but applicable operations to noise are usually restricted by symmetries inherent in quantum gates. In this work, we propose symmetric Clifford twirling, a Clifford twirling utilizing only symmetric Clifford operators that commute with certain Pauli subgroups. We fully characterize how each Pauli noise is converted through the twirling and show that certain Pauli noise can be scrambled to a noise exponentially close to the global white noise. Moreover, we provide numerical demonstrations for highly structured circuits, such as Trotterized Hamiltonian simulation circuits, that noise effect on typical observables can be described by the global white noise. We further demonstrate that symmetric Clifford twirling and its hardware-efficient variant using only local symmetric Clifford operators can significantly accelerate the scrambling. These findings enable us to mitigate errors in non-Clifford operations with minimal sampling overhead in the early fault-tolerant regime.

TI Gravitationally induced entanglement at finite temperature: A
   memory-driven time-crystalline phase?
SO JOURNAL OF HIGH ENERGY PHYSICS
AB We study the impact of thermal effects on gravity-induced entanglement (GIE) in a system of quantum harmonic oscillators interacting with classical linearly polarized gravitational waves (GWs). Specifically, we model the endpoints of interferometer arms in LIGO-like detectors as two-dimensional oscillators. Following the thermofield dynamics (TFD) approach, our analysis reveals that while thermal effects alone do not generate entanglement between independent oscillator modes, they serve as a catalyst, modifying the dynamical imprint of GWs. Notably, we identify a mixing of Bose-Einstein and Maxwell-Boltzmann distributions driven by thermal influences, which affects the statistical behavior of the quantum subsystem. Furthermore, gravitational interactions induce a quantum memory effect, leading to emergent periodic behavior in the reduced subsystem. This suggests a novel gravitationally induced breaking of time-translation symmetry, reminiscent of a prethermal time crystal (PTC). Our findings indicate that such effects could provide new theoretical insights into classical gravitational wave interactions.

TI Long-Range Azimuthal Correlation, Entanglement, and Bell Inequality
   Violation by Spinning Gluons at the Large Hadron Collider
SO RESEARCH
AB We apply the recently developed concept of the nucleon energy-energy correlator (NEEC) for the gluon sector to investigate the long-range azimuthal angular correlations in proton-proton collisions at the Large Hadron Collider. The spinning gluon in these collisions will introduce substantial nonzero cos(2 phi) asymmetries in both Higgs boson and top quark pair productions, where phi is the azimuthal angle between the forward and backward energy correlators in the NEEC observables. The genesis of the cos(2 phi) correlation lies in the intricate quantum entanglement. Owing to the substantial cos(2 phi) effect, the NEEC observable in Higgs boson and tt<overline> production emerges as a pivotal avenue for delving into quantum entanglement and scrutinizing the Bell inequality at high-energy colliders.

TI Weight Optimization of Discrete Truss Structures Using Quantum-Based HS
   Algorithm
SO BUILDINGS
AB Recently, a new field that combines metaheuristic algorithms and quantum computing has been created and is being applied to optimization problems in various fields. However, the application of quantum computing-based metaheuristic algorithms to the optimization of structural engineering is insufficient. Therefore, in this paper, we tried to optimize the weight of the truss structure using the QbHS (quantum-based harmony search) algorithm, which combines quantum computing and conventional HS (harmony search) algorithms. First, the convergence performance according to the parameter change of the QbHS algorithm was compared. The parameters selected for the comparison of convergence performance are QHMS, QHMCR, QPAR, & epsilon;, and & theta;r. The selected parameters were compared using six benchmark functions, and the range for deriving the optimal convergence performance was found. In addition, weight optimization was performed by applying it to a truss structure with a discrete cross-sectional area. The QbHS algorithm derived a lower weight than the QEA (quantum-inspired evolutionary algorithm) and confirmed that the convergence performance was better. A new algorithm that combines quantum computing and metaheuristic algorithms is required for application to various engineering problems, and this effort is essential for the expansion of future algorithm development.

TI Emergent Dark States from Superradiant Dynamics in Multilevel Atoms in a
   Cavity
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW X
AB We investigate the collective decay dynamics of atoms with a generic multilevel structure (angular momenta F <-> F') coupled to two light modes of different polarization inside a cavity. In contrast to two-level atoms, we find that multilevel atoms can harbor eigenstates that are perfectly dark to cavity decay even within the subspace of permutationally symmetric states (collective Dicke manifold). The dark states arise from destructive interference between different internal transitions and are shown to be entangled. Remarkably, the superradiant decay of multilevel atoms can end up stuck in one of these dark states, where a macroscopic fraction of the atoms remains excited. This opens the door to the preparation of entangled dark states of matter through collective dissipation that arc useful for quantum sensing and quantum simulation. Our predictions should be readily observable in current optical cavity experiments with alkaline-earth atoms or Raman-dressed transitions.

TI Refined symmetry-resolved Page curve and charged black holes
SO CHINESE PHYSICS C
AB The Page curve plotted using the typical random state approximation is not applicable to a system with conserved quantities, such as the evaporation process of a charged black hole, during which the electric charge does not macroscopically radiate out with a uniform rate. In this context, the symmetry-resolved entanglement entropy may play a significant role in describing the entanglement structure of such a system. We attempt to impose constraints on microscopic quantum states to match the macroscopic phenomenon of charge radiation during black hole evaporation. Specifically, we consider a simple qubit system with conserved spin/charge serving as a toy model for the evaporation of charged black holes. We propose refined rules for selecting a random state with conserved quantities to simulate the distribution of charges during the different stages of evaporation and obtain refined Page curves that exhibit distinct features in contrast to the original Page curve. We find that the refined Page curve may have a different Page time and exhibit asymmetric behavior on both sides of the Page time. Such refined Page curves may provide a more realistic description for the entanglement between the charged black hole and radiation during the evaporation process.

TI Quantum chemistry simulation of ground- and excited-state properties of
   the sulfonium cation on a superconducting quantum processor
SO CHEMICAL SCIENCE
AB The computational description of correlated electronic structure, and particularly of excited states of many-electron systems, is an anticipated application for quantum devices. An important ramification is to determine the dominant molecular fragmentation pathways in photo-dissociation experiments of light-sensitive compounds, like sulfonium-based photo-acid generators used in photolithography. Here we simulate the static and dynamical electronic structure of the H3S+ molecule, taken as a minimal model of a triply-bonded sulfur cation, on a superconducting quantum processor of the IBM Falcon architecture. To this end, we generalize a qubit reduction technique termed entanglement forging or EF [A. Eddins et al., Phys. Rev. X Quantum, 2022, 3, 010309], currently restricted to the evaluation of ground-state energies, to the treatment of molecular properties. While in a conventional quantum simulation a qubit represents a spin-orbital, within EF a qubit represents a spatial orbital, reducing the number of required qubits by half. We combine the generalized EF with quantum subspace expansion [W. Colless et al., Phys. Rev. X, 2018, 8, 011021], a technique used to project the time-independent Schrodinger equation for ground- and excited-states in a subspace. To enable experimental demonstration of this algorithmic workflow, we deploy a sequence of error-mitigation techniques. We compute dipole structure factors and partial atomic charges along ground- and excited-state potential energy curves, revealing the occurrence of homo- and heterolytic fragmentation. This study is an important step towards the computational description of photo-dissociation on near-term quantum devices, as it can be generalized to other photodissociation processes and naturally extended in different ways to achieve more realistic simulations.

TI Entanglement generation across exceptional points in a two-qubit open
   quantum system: The role of initial states
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW E
AB We study an open quantum system of two qubits that are coupled by swapping interaction. Using the coupling strength between the qubits as a timescale, the Liouvillian of the system has exceptional points that depend on the disparity between the decay rates of the qubits. We find that the configuration of the initial states plays an important role in deciding the character of the entanglement dynamics at the initial stage of evolution. Depending on whether or not the initial excitations of the qubits can be swapped by the interaction that couples them, a change in the total decay rate can be either consistently unfavorable to entanglement generation, or shift the dynamics from hindering to enhancing entanglement generation, or vice versa, as the system traverses the exceptional points. The shift could also occur in a wide range of mixed states. We clarify the origin of the behavior in this work.

TI Efficient quantum measurement of Pauli operators in the presence of
   finite sampling error
SO QUANTUM
AB Estimating the expectation value of an operator corresponding to an observable is a fundamental task in quantum computation. It is often impossible to obtain such estimates directly, as the computer is restricted to measuring in a fixed computational basis. One common solution splits the operator into a weighted sum of Pauli operators and measures each separately, at the cost of many measurements. An improved version collects mutually commuting Pauli operators together before measuring all operators within a collection simultaneously. The effectiveness of doing this depends on two factors. Firstly, we must understand the improvement offered by a given arrangement of Paulis in collections. In our work, we propose two natural metrics for quantifying this, operating under the assumption that measurements are distributed optimally among collections so as to minimise the overall finite sampling error. Motivated by the mathematical form of these metrics, we introduce SORTED INSERTION, a collecting strategy that exploits the weighting of each Pauli operator in the overall sum. Secondly, to measure all Pauli operators within a collection simultaneously, a circuit is required to rotate them to the computational basis. In our work, we present two efficient circuit constructions that suitably rotate any collection of k independent commuting n-qubit Pauli operators using at most kn - k(k + 1)/2 and O(kn/ log k) two-qubit gates respectively. Our methods are numerically illustrated in the context of the Variational Quantum Eigensolver, where the operators in question are molecular Hamiltonians. As measured by our metrics, SORTED INSERTION outperforms four conventional greedy colouring algorithms that seek the minimum number of collections.

TI Local simultaneous state discrimination
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Quantum state discrimination is one of the most fundamental problems in quantum information theory, with applications ranging from channel coding to metrology and cryptography. In this work, we introduce a variant of this task: local simultaneous state discrimination (LSSD). While previously studied distributed variants of state discrimination allowed some communication between the parties to come up with a joint answer, in LSSD they cannot communicate and have to simultaneously answer correctly. We illustrate by multiple examples that this problem significantly differs from single -party state discrimination, even when the states are completely classical. We show that an additional entangled resource can increase the optimal success probability in LSSD, and stronger -than -quantum no -signaling resources can allow for an even higher success probability. We also show that finding the optimal strategy in (classical) three -party LSSD is NP -hard. Furthermore, we provide an example of symmetric LSSD for which the optimal strategy is not symmetric, and prove a sufficient condition for the existence of an optimal symmetric strategy. While interesting in its own right, the LSSD problem also arises in quantum cryptography. In particular, we explore the connections between the problem of unclonable encryption and LSSD. We give an explicit cloning -indistinguishable attack that succeeds with probability 1 / 2 + mu/ 16 where mu is related to the largest eigenvalue of the resulting quantum ciphertext states.

TI Spin and orbital spectroscopy in the absence of Coulomb blockade in lead
   telluride nanowire quantum dots
SO SCIPOST PHYSICS
AB We investigate quantum dots in semiconductor PbTe nanowire devices. Due to the accessibility of ambipolar transport in PbTe, quantum dots can be occupied both with electrons and holes. Owing to a very large dielectric constant in PbTe of order 1000, we do not observe Coulomb blockade which typically obfuscates the orbital and spin spectra. We extract large and highly anisotropic effective Lande g-factors, in the range 20-44. The absence of Coulomb blockade allows direct readout, at zero source-drain bias, of spin-orbit hybridization energies of up to 600 mu eV. These spin properties make PbTe nanowires, the recently synthesized members of group IV-VI materials family, attractive as a materials platform for quantum technology, such as spin and topological qubits.

TI Efficient generation of entangled multiphoton graph states from a single
   atom
SO NATURE
AB The central technological appeal of quantum science resides in exploiting quantum effects, such as entanglement, for a variety of applications, including computing, communication and sensing(1). The overarching challenge in these fields is to address, control and protect systems of many qubits against decoherence(2). Against this backdrop, optical photons, naturally robust and easy to manipulate, represent ideal qubit carriers. However, the most successful technique so far for creating photonic entanglement(3) is inherently probabilistic and, therefore, subject to severe scalability limitations. Here we report the implementation of a deterministic protocol(4-6) for the creation of photonic entanglement with a single memory atom in a cavity(7). We interleave controlled single-photon emissions with tailored atomic qubit rotations to efficiently grow Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) states(8) of up to 14 photons andlinear cluster states(9) of up to 12 photons with a fidelity lower bounded by 76(6)% and 56(4)%, respectively. Thanks to a source-to-detection efficiency of 43.18(7)% per photon, we measure these large states about once every minute, which is orders of magnitude faster than in any previous experiment(3,10-13). In the future, this rate could be increased even further, the scheme could be extended to two atoms in a cavity(14,15) or several sources could be quantum mechanically coupled(16), to generate higher-dimensional cluster states(17). Overcoming the limitations encountered by probabilistic schemes for photonic entanglement generation, our results may offer a way towards scalable measurement-based quantum computation(18,19) and communication(20,21).

These multi-qudit states can be expressed as superpositions of su(2s+1) qudit Dicke states. They satisfy a recursion formula, which is used to formulate an efficient quantum circuit for their preparation, whose size scales as sk(2sn-k), where n is the number of qudits and k is the number of times the total spin-lowering operator is applied to the highest-weight state. The algorithm is deterministic and does not require ancillary qudits.

TI Beating the standard quantum limit under ambient conditions with
   solid-state spins
SO SCIENCE ADVANCES
AB The use of entangled sensors improves the precision limit from the standard quantum limit (SQL) to the Heisenberg limit. Most previous experiments beating the SQL are performed on the sensors that are well isolated under extreme conditions. Here, we demonstrate a sub-SQL interferometer at ambient conditions by using a multispin system, namely, the nitrogen-vacancy (NV) defect in diamond. We achieve two-spin interference with a phase sensitivity of 1.79 +/- 0.06 dB beyond the SQL and three-spin interference with a phase sensitivity of 2.77 +/- 0.10 dB. Besides, a magnetic sensitivity of 0.87 +/- 0.09 dB beyond the SQL is achieved by two-spin interference for detecting a real magnetic field. Particularly, the deterministic and joint initialization of NV negative state, NV electron spin, and two nuclear spins is realized at room temperature. The techniques used here are of fundamental importance for quantum sensing and computing, and naturally applicable to other solid-state spin systems.

TI Fabrication of single color centers in sub-50 nm nanodiamonds using ion
   implantation
SO NANOPHOTONICS
AB Diamond color centers have been widely studied in the field of quantum optics. The negatively charged silicon vacancy (SiV-) center exhibits a narrow emission linewidth at the wavelength of 738 nm, a high Debye-Waller factor, and unique spin properties, making it a promising emitter for quantum information technologies, biological imaging, and sensing. In particular, nanodiamond (ND)-based SiV- centers can be heterogeneously integrated with plasmonic and photonic nanostructures and serve as in vivo biomarkers and intracellular thermometers. Out of all methods to produce NDs with SiV- centers, ion implantation offers the unique potential to create controllable numbers of color centers in preselected individual NDs. However, the formation of single color centers in NDs with this technique has not been realized. We report the creation of single SiV- centers featuring stable high-purity single-photon emission through Si implantation into NDs with an average size of & SIM;20 nm. We observe room temperature emission, with zero-phonon line wavelengths in the range of 730-800 nm and linewidths below 10 nm. Our results offer new opportunities for the controlled production of group-IV diamond color centers with applications in quantum photonics, sensing, and biomedicine.

TI Majorana Anyon Composites in Magneto-Photoluminescence Spectra of
   Natural Quantum Hall Puddles
SO NANOMATERIALS
AB In magneto-photoluminescence (magneto-PL) spectra of quasi two-dimensional islands (quantum dots) having seven electrons and Wigner-Seitz radius r(s)similar to 1.5, we revealed a suppression of magnetic field (B) dispersion, paramagnetic shifts, and jumps of the energy of the emission components for filling factors nu > 1 (B < 10 T). Additionally, we observed B-hysteresis of the jumps and a dependence of all these anomalous features on r(s). Using a theoretical description of the magneto-PL spectra and an analysis of the electronic structure of these dots based on the single-particle Fock-Darwin spectrum and many-particle configuration-interaction calculations, we show that these observations can be described by the r(s)-dependent formation of the anyon (magneto-electron) composites (ACs) involving single-particle states having non-zero angular momentum and that the anyon states observed involve Majorana modes (MMs), including zero-B modes having an equal number of vortexes and anti-vortexes, which can be considered as Majorana anyons. We show that the paramagnetic shift corresponds to a destruction of the equilibrium self-formed nu similar to 5/2 AC by the external magnetic field and that the jumps and their hysteresis can be described in terms of Majorana qubit states controlled by B and r(s). Our results show a critical role of quantum confinement in the formation of magneto-electrons and implies the liquid-crystal nature of fractional quantum Hall effect states, the Majorana anyon origin of the states having even nu, i.e., composite fermions, which provide new opportunities for topological quantum computing.

TI Finite Rate QLDPC-GKP Coding Scheme that Surpasses the CSS Hamming Bound
SO QUANTUM
AB Quantum error correction has recently been shown to benefit greatly from specific physical encodings of the code qubits. In particular, several researchers have considered the individual code qubits being encoded with the continuous variable Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill (GKP) code, and then imposed an outer discrete-variable code such as the surface code on these GKP qubits. Under such a concatenation scheme, the analog information from the inner GKP error correction improves the noise thresh-old of the outer code. However, the surface code has vanishing rate and demands a lot of resources with growing distance. In this work, we concatenate the GKP code with generic quantum low-density parity-check (QLDPC) codes and demonstrate a natural way to exploit the GKP analog information in iterative decoding algorithms. We first show the noise thresholds for two lifted product QLDPC code families, and then show the improvements of noise thresholds when the iterative decoder - a hardware -friendly min-sum algorithm (MSA) -utilizes the GKP analog information. We also show that, when the GKP analog information is combined with a sequential update schedule for MSA, the scheme surpasses the well-known CSS Hamming bound for these code families. Furthermore, we observe that the GKP analog information helps the iterative decoder in escaping harmful trapping sets in the Tanner graph of the QLDPC code, thereby eliminating or significantly lowering the error floor of the logical error rate curves. Finally, we discuss new fundamental and practical questions that arise from this work on channel capacity under GKP ana-log information, and on improving decoder design and analysis.

TI Interplay of Spin Nernst Effect and Entanglement Negativity in Layered
   Ferrimagnets: A Study via Exact Diagonalization
SO ENTROPY
AB In this paper, we analyzed the influence of the spin Nernst effect on quantum correlation in a layered ferrimagnetic model. In the study of three-dimensional ferrimagnets, the focus is on materials with a specific arrangement of spins, where the neighboring spins are parallel and the others are antiparallel. The anisotropic nature of these materials means that the interactions between spins depend on their relative orientations in different directions. We analyzed the effect of magnon bands induced by the coupling parameters on entanglement negativity. The influence of the coupling parameters of the topologic phase transition on quantum entanglement is investigated as well. Numerical simulations using the Lanczos algorithm and exact diagonalization for different lattice sizes are compared with the results of spin wave theory.

TI Quantum Coarse Graining for Extreme Dimension Reduction in Modeling
   Stochastic Temporal Dynamics
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB Stochastic modeling of complex systems plays an essential, yet often computationally intensive, role across the quantitative sciences. Recent advances in quantum information processing have elucidated the potential for quantum simulators to exhibit memory advantages for such tasks. Heretofore, the focus has been on lossless memory compression, wherein the advantage is typically in terms of lessening the amount of information tracked by the model, while - arguably more practical - reductions in memory dimension are not always possible. Here, we address the case of lossy compression for quantum stochastic modeling of continuous-time processes, introducing a method for coarse graining in quantum state space that drastically reduces the requisite memory dimension for modeling temporal dynamics while retaining near-exact statistics. In contrast to classical coarse graining, this compression is not based on sacrificing temporal resolution and brings memory-efficient high-fidelity stochastic modeling within reach of present quantum technologies.

TI Recent Advances in Single Crystal Diamond Device Fabrication for
   Photonics, Sensing and Nanomechanics
SO MICROMACHINES
AB In the last two decades, the use of diamond as a material for applications in nanophotonics, optomechanics, quantum information, and sensors tremendously increased due to its outstanding mechanical properties, wide optical transparency, and biocompatibility. This has been possible owing to advances in methods for growth of high-quality single crystal diamond (SCD), nanofabrication methods and controlled incorporation of optically active point defects (e.g., nitrogen vacancy centers) in SCD. This paper reviews the recent advances in SCD nano-structuring methods for realization of micro- and nano-structures. Novel fabrication methods are discussed and the different nano-structures realized for a wide range of applications are summarized. Moreover, the methods for color center incorporation in SCD and surface treatment methods to enhance their properties are described. Challenges in the upscaling of SCD nano-structure fabrication, their commercial applications and future prospects are discussed.

TI Acoustically induced coherent spin trapping
SO SCIENCE ADVANCES
AB Spin centers are promising qubits for quantum technologies. Here, we show that the acoustic manipulation of spin qubits in their electronic excited state provides an approach for coherent spin control inaccessible so far. We demonstrate a giant interaction between the strain field of a surface acoustic wave (SAW) and the excited-state spin of silicon vacancies in silicon carbide, which is about two orders of magnitude stronger than in the ground state. The simultaneous spin driving in the ground and excited states with the same SAW leads to the trapping of the spin along a direction given by the frequency detuning from the corresponding spin resonances. The coherence of the spin-trapped states becomes only limited by relaxation processes intrinsic to the ground state. The coherent acoustic manipulation of spins in the ground and excited state provides new opportunities for efficient on-chip quantum information protocols and coherent sensing.

TI One classical bit perspective on the noisy teleportation of quantum
   coherence
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB Quantum teleportation of an unknown quantum state necessitates the transmission of two classical bits of information; however, when the quantum state is partially known, only a single classical bit is required for the teleportation of its quantum coherence. In this study, we explore the teleportation of quantum coherence through noisy channels utilizing merely one classical bit of information. Our findings reveal that, in contrast to noise-free scenarios, the generalized Bell states POVM (GBS-POVM) and non-maximally entangled states may surpass the performance of Bell states POVM (BS-POVM) and maximally entangled states in enabling probabilistic teleportation of quantum coherence. Nevertheless, when assessing the average amount of quantum coherence that can be teleported, maximally entangled states combined with BS-POVM emerges as the optimal choice, regardless of the type of noise encountered. Moreover, we uncover that for bit-phase-flip (BPF) noise, it is feasible to construct a suitable GBS-POVM that completely mitigates this noise. For other types of noise, we demonstrate that enhancing the teleportation of quantum coherence can be accomplished through entangling two consecutive uses of the same noisy channel, i.e., correlated noise. Notably, correlation effects arising from Pauli channels can entirely negate the detrimental impact of Pauli noises on the teleportation process for quantum coherence.

TI Quantum Mechanical Approaches to Strongly Correlated Electron Systems:
   Structure, Bonding, and Properties of Diradicals, Triradicals, and
   Polyradicals
SO CHEMISTRY-SWITZERLAND
AB The structure, bonding, and properties of diradicals, triradicals, and polyradicals have been investigated using broken symmetry (BS) molecular orbital (MO) and BS density functional theory (DFT) methods, which are regarded as the first steps in the mean-field approach toward strongly correlated electron systems (SCES). The natural orbital (NO) analyses of the BS MO and BS DFT solutions were performed to elucidate the natural orbitals of their occupation numbers, which are used for derivations of the diradical character (y) and several chemical indices for the open-shell molecules under investigation. These chemical indices are also obtained using SCES, the next theoretical step, which uses symmetry-recovered resonating BS (RBS) and multi-determinant methods such as multi-reference (MR) configuration interaction (CI) and MR-coupled cluster (CC) methods that employ the NOs generated in the first step. The nonlinear optical response properties of organic open-shell species were theoretically investigated with several procedures, such as MR CI (CC), the numerical Liouville, and Monte Carlo wavefunction methods, as the third step to SCES. The second-order hyperpolarizability (gamma) of diradicals such as a phenalenyl radical dimer were mainly investigated in relation to the generation of quantum squeezed lights, which are used for the construction of the quantum entangled states for quantum optical devices such as quantum sensing and quantum computation. Basic quantum mechanical concepts, such as the Pegg-Barnett quantum phase operator, were also revisited in relation to the design and chemical synthesis of stable diradicals and polyradicals such as optical quantum molecular materials and future molecular qubits materials.

SO ACTA PHYSICA SINICA
AB Silicon-based semiconductor quantum computing with spin as the encoding unit is compatible with traditional microelectronic processes, easy to expand, and can improve isotope purification and decoherence time, thus attracting much attention. There are fewer reports on the work related to undoped Si/SiGe heterostructures grown by molecular beam epitaxy than those on chemical vapor deposition. An undoped Si/SiGe heterostructure is grown by molecular beam epitaxy (see the attached figure below). The results from scanning transmission electron microscopy and energy-dispersive spectroscopy mapping show an atomic-scale interface with a characteristic length of 0.53 nm. The surface root-mean-square roughness measured by atomic force microscope is 0.44 nm. The X-ray diffraction data show that the Si quantum well is fully strained and the in-plane strain is 1.03%. In addition, the performance of the two-dimensional electron gas is evaluated by lowtemperature Hall measurements, which are conducted in the Hall-bar shaped field-effect transistor. The peak mobility is 20.21x10(4) cm(2)center dot V-1 center dot s(-1) when the carrier density is about 6.265x10(11) cm(-2) at 250 mK. The percolation density is 1.465x10(11) cm(-2). The effective mass of the two-dimensional electron gas is approximately 0.19m(0). The power exponential between carrier density and mobility at different gate voltages is 1.026, and the Dingle ratio of the two-dimensional electron gas is in a range of 7-12, indicating that the electrons are scattered by background impurities and semiconductor/

TI Spatially Encoded Polaritonic Ultra-Strong Coupling in Gradient
   Metasurfaces with Epsilon-Near-Zero Modes
SO ADVANCED MATERIALS
AB A platform is introduced to achieve ultra-strong coupling (USC) between light and matter using widely available materials. USC is a light-matter interaction regime characterized by coupling strengths exceeding 10% of the ground state energy. It gives rise to novel physical phenomena, such as efficient single-photon coupling and quantum gates, with applications in quantum sensing, nonlinear optics, and low-threshold lasing. Although early demonstrations in plasmonic systems have been realized, achieving USC in dielectric platforms, which offer lower losses and high Q-factors, remains challenging due to typically low mode overlap between the photonic field and the material resonance. Here, dielectric dual gradient metasurfaces supporting quasi-bound-states-in-the-continuum are leveraged to spatially encode both the spectral and coupling parameter space and demonstrate USC to an epsilon-near-zero (ENZ) mode in an ultra-thin SiO2 layer. The strong out-of-plane electric fields in tapered bar structure overlap exceptionally well with those of the ENZ mode, resulting in a normalized coupling strength of eta = 0.10 and a mode splitting equivalent to 20% of the ENZ mode energy; a four-to-five-fold increase compared to previous approaches. The strong field confinement of the approach opens new possibilities for compact and scalable polaritonic devices, such as tunable frequency converters and low-energy optical modulators.

SO OPTICS LETTERS
AB High-dimensional entanglement is a promising resource for quantum technologies. Being able to certify it for any quantum state is essential. However, to date, experimental entanglement certification methods are imperfect and leave some loopholes open. Using a single-photon-sensitive time-stamping camera, we quantify high-dimensional spatial entanglement by collecting all output modes and without background subtraction, two critical steps on the route toward assumptions-free entanglement certification. We show position-momentum Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR) correlations and quantify the entanglement of formation of our source to be larger than 2.8 along both transverse spatial axes, indicating a dimension higher than 14. Our work overcomes important challenges in photonic entanglement quantification and paves the way toward the development of practical quantum information processing protocols based on high-dimensional entanglement.& COPY; 2023 Optica Publishing Group

TI Non-Orthogonality Measure for a Collection of Pure Quantum States
SO ENTROPY
AB Modern optical communication technology can realize a large-scale multilevel (or M-ary) optical signal. Investigating the quantum mechanical nature of such a large-scale M-ary optical signal is essential for a unified understanding of quantum information science and optical communication technology. This article focuses on the quantum-mechanical non-orthogonality for a collection of pure quantum states and proposes a non-orthogonality index based on the least squares error criterion in quantum detection theory. First, we define the index for linearly independent signals, and the proposed index is analyzed through numerical simulations. Next, the index is applied to a highly large-scale M-ary phase-shift keying (PSK) coherent state signal. Furthermore, the index is compared with the capacity of the pure state channel with the PSK signal. As a result, it is shown that a highly large-scale M-ary PSK coherent state signal exhibits a quantum nature even when the signal transmission power is very high. Thus, the theoretical characterization of a highly large-scale M-ary coherent state signal based on the proposed index will be the first step toward a better understanding of cutting-edge optical communication technologies such as the quantum stream cipher Y00.

TI Long-range transport in asymmetric quadruple quantum dot configurations
SO COMMUNICATIONS PHYSICS
AB Quantum dot arrays are a versatile platform for investigating coherent charge and spin transport, with direct relevance for scalable quantum information processing. While long-range tunneling has been extensively studied in triple quantum dots, the role of reduced symmetry in quadruple quantum dot (QQD) systems remains largely unexplored. Here we show, employing a master equation approach, that coherent long-range charge transfer can persist in QQDs even under reduced symmetry configurations. We identify clear resonance conditions characterized by strongly suppressed population of the intermediate dots, as well as distinctive signatures such as interference between competing long-range channels and current blockade effects. Our results, obtained with experimentally realistic parameters, establish that efficient long-range transfer does not require perfect symmetry, and provide theoretical guidance for future experimental efforts to harness coherent transport in extended quantum dot arrays for quantum technologies.

AB Quantum computers are reaching a level where interactions between classical and quantum computations can happen in real-time. This marks the advent of a new, broader class of quantum circuits: dynamic quantum circuits. They offer a broader range of available computing primitives that lead to new challenges for design tasks such as simulation, compilation, and verification. Due to the non-unitary nature of dynamic circuit primitives, most existing techniques and tools for these tasks are no longer applicable in an out-of-the-box fashion. In this work, we discuss the resulting consequences for quantum circuit verification, specifically equivalence checking, and propose two different schemes that eventually allow to treat the involved circuits as if they did not contain non-unitaries at all. As a result, we demonstrate methodically, as well as, experimentally that existing techniques for verifying the equivalence of quantum circuits can be kept applicable for this broader class of circuits.

TI Dual-Level Template for Enhancing Resolution of Quantum Images
SO JOURNAL OF ADVANCED COMPUTATIONAL INTELLIGENCE AND INTELLIGENT
   INFORMATICS
AB Quantum information science is an emerging research field devoted to the use of quantum mechanical systems to devise and implement information processing tasks faster than that possible with classical computers. In this study, two quantum image resolution enhancement (QIRE-I and QIRE-II) schemes are proposed based on quantum wavelet transformand quantum interpolation. Using these, the resolutions of low-resolution (LR) images are enhanced by decomposing them into four frequency sub-bands using a single-level one-dimensional (1-D) quantum Haar wavelet transform (QHWT). Subsequently, to preserve the edges and obtain sharper high-resolution (HR) images, quantum interpolation was applied to three of the high-frequency sub-bands. A few simulation-based demonstrations are presented to illustrate the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed schemes. The visual and quantitative results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed schemes over those that use only quantum interpolation.

TI Tunable quantum interference using a topological source of
   indistinguishable photon pairs
SO NATURE PHOTONICS
AB Sources of quantum light, in particular correlated photon pairs that are indistinguishable for all degrees of freedom, are the fundamental resource for photonic quantum computation and simulation. Although such sources have been recently realized using integrated photonics, they offer limited ability to tune the spectral and temporal correlations between generated photons because they rely on a single component, such as a ring resonator. Here, we demonstrate a tunable source of indistinguishable photon pairs using dual-pump spontaneous four-wave mixing in a topological system comprising a two-dimensional array of resonators. We exploit the linear dispersion of the topological edge states to tune the spectral bandwidth (by about 3.5x), and thereby, to tune quantum interference between generated photons by tuning the two pump frequencies. We demonstrate energy-time entanglement and, using numerical simulations, confirm the topological robustness of our source. Our results could lead to tunable, frequency-multiplexed quantum light sources for photonic quantum technologies.
   Indistinguishable photon pairs are generated via four-wave mixing in a two-dimensional array of ring resonators that exhibit topological edge states. They show tunable spectral-temporal correlations and robustness against fabrication disorders.

   review
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF QUANTUM CHEMISTRY
AB The field of quantum computing has undergone significant expansion and development in recent years. A quantitative and comprehensive examination of the research domain is essential to comprehend research trends and directions in the field. Henceforth, the current paper conducts a scientometric analysis of the academic literature on quantum computing retrieved from the Scopus database to understand the recent advances made by researchers in the domain. The analysis evaluates the state of the discipline's research by examining the most prominent journals and highly referenced articles. CiteSpace is leveraged to visualize the intellectual landscape of quantum state preparation by performing document co-citation and author co-citation analysis. The analysis reveals that trapped ions, photonic qubits, superconducting qubits, nitrogen-vacancy centers, and nuclear spin qubits are the primary research topics in quantum computing. Furthermore, the most current research issues that require attention in the field are measurement-based qubits, Majorana fermions, and quantum dots.

TI Biased estimator channels for classical shadows
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Extracting classical information from quantum systems is of fundamental importance, and classical shadows allow us to extract a large amount of information using relatively few measurements. Conventional shadow estimators are unbiased and thus agree with the true mean in expectation. In this Letter, we consider a biased scheme, intentionally introducing a bias in the expectation value by rescaling the conventional classical-shadow estimators to reduce the error in the finite-sample regime. The approach is straightforward to implement and requires no quantum resources. We analytically prove average-case as well as worst-and best-case scenarios, and rigorously prove that it is, in principle, always worth biasing the estimators. We illustrate our approach in a quantum simulation task of a 12-qubit spin-ring problem and demonstrate how estimating expected values of nonlocal perturbations can be significantly more efficient using our biased scheme.

TI Cavity-enhanced single artificial atoms in silicon
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Artificial atoms in solids are leading candidates for quantum networks, scalable quantum computing, and sensing, as they combine long-lived spins with mobile photonic qubits. Recently, silicon has emerged as a promising host material where artificial atoms with long spin coherence times and emission into the telecommunications band can be controllably fabricated. This field leverages the maturity of silicon photonics to embed artificial atoms into the world's most advanced microelectronics and photonics platform. However, a current bottleneck is the naturally weak emission rate of these atoms, which can be addressed by coupling to an optical cavity. Here, we demonstrate cavity-enhanced single artificial atoms in silicon (G-centers) at telecommunication wavelengths. Our results show enhancement of their zero phonon line intensities along with highly pure single-photon emission, while their lifetime remains statistically unchanged. We suggest the possibility of two different existing types of G-centers, shedding new light on the properties of silicon emitters.
   The authors demonstrate a cavity enhancement of single artificial atoms at telecommunication wavelengths in silicon by coupling them to highly optimized photonic crystal cavities, showing intensity enhancement and highly pure single-photon emission.

TI Compression of the Synchrotron Mossbauer X-ray Photon Waveform in an
   Oscillating Resonant Absorber
SO PHOTONICS
AB A technique to transform the waveform of a 14.4 keV photon (time dependence of the photon detection probability or, equivalently, the intensity of the single-photon wave packet) into a regular sequence of short, nearly bandwidth-limited pulses with a controlled number of pulses is proposed. It is based on coherent forward scattering of single X-ray photons from a synchrotron Mossbauer source (SMS) in an optically thick, vibrating, recoilless Fe-57 resonant absorber. The possibility of compressing the waveform of an SMS photon into a single short bell-shaped pulse is predicted. The experiment is proposed for compressing a 100 ns duration 14.4 keV single-photon wave packet produced by SMS at the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility (ESRF) into a single bell-shaped pulse of less than 20 ns duration and more than twice the peak intensity. Such single-photon coherent pulses are promising for applications in the fast-developing field of X-ray quantum optics, including possible implementation of quantum memory.

TI Witness of non-Markovian dynamics based on Bhattacharyya quantum
   distance
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB Non-Markovian effects due to quantum memory in the dynamics of open systems typically correspond to information backflows from the surrounding environment to the system. We propose a witness to quantify the non-Markovianity of quantum evolutions using the Bhattacharyya distance (BD), a specific quantum statistical distance. This witness has the advantage of not requiring the calculation of the evolved density matrix and only computes through the initial and final states of the system, therefore leading to the improvement of quantum metrology. It means that we calculate the quantum angle between two states to detect non-Markovian effects. This proposal is investigated by considering several instances of open quantum systems, such as two and three-level atoms interacting in single and two-mode fields, respectively, and two effective two-level atoms interacting locally with two independent environments. We demonstrate that the suggested BD-based non-Markovianity witness identifies memory effects, consistent with well-established witnesses based on Bures distance, quantum Fisher information, and Hilbert-Schmidt speed, showing sensitivity to information backflows.

TI Application of Quantum Natural Language Processing for Language
   Translation
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB In this paper, we develop compositional vector-based semantics of positive transitive sentences using quantum natural language processing (Q-NLP) to compare the parametrized quantum circuits of two synonymous simple sentences in English and Persian. We propose a protocol based on quantum long short-term memory (Q-LSTM) for Q-NLP to perform various tasks in general but specifically for translating a sentence from English to Persian. Then, we generalize our method to use quantum circuits of sentences as an input for the Q-LSTM cell. This enables us to translate sentences in different languages. Our work paves the way toward representing quantum neural machine translation, which may demonstrate quadratic speedup and converge faster or reaches a better accuracy over classical methods.

TI First-order thermal insensitivity of the frequency of a narrow spectral
   hole in a crystal
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB The possibility of generating a narrow spectral hole in a rare-earth doped crystal opens the gateway to a variety of applications, one of which is the realization of an ultrastable laser. As this is achieved by locking in a prestabilized laser to the narrow hole, a prerequisite is the elimination of frequency fluctuations of the spectral hole. One potential source of such fluctuations can arise from temperature instabilities. However, when the crystal is surrounded by a buffer gas subject to the same temperature as the crystal, the effect of temperature-induced pressure changes may be used to counterbalance the direct effect of temperature fluctuations. For a particular pressure, it is indeed possible to identify a temperature for which the spectral hole resonant frequency is independent of the first-order thermal fluctuations. Here, we measure frequency shifts as a function of temperature for different values of the pressure of the surrounding buffer gas, and identify the "magic" environment within which the spectral hole is largely insensitive to temperature.

TI Light narrowing over broad temperature range with paraffin-coated vapor
   cells
SO JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYSICS
AB This study reports light narrowing in paraffin-coated vapor cells from room temperature 27 to 59 degrees C, where spin-exchange relaxation is suppressed. By means of a coating lock and eliminating the reservoir effect, an ultra-narrow magnetic resonance linewidth of 0.36 Hz and an atomic coherence lifetime of T-2 = 0.9 s are achieved. In cells free of buffer gas, the narrow linewidth over this broad temperature range is a result of enhanced spin polarization, which is facilitated by the effective suppression of radiation trapping benefiting from the stability of the vapor density. Using such cells in atomic magnetometers, the photon shot noise limit is estimated as 0.2 fT / Hz (1/2) and the spin-projection noise limit is estimated as 1.1 fT / Hz(1/2). Also, a magnetometer system with the stable coated cell is identified, which demonstrates the potential for achieving relatively stable magnetometer sensitivity without precisely controlling the cell temperature. The long coherence lifetime and the broad operating temperature range expand the potential applications of quantum memory and other quantum sensors such as atomic clocks.

TI Semimetallic superconductivity in cubic Nd3In: a
   first-principles insight into indium-based compounds
SO RSC ADVANCES
AB The quest for materials that simultaneously exhibit superconductivity and nontrivial topology has drawn significant attention in recent years, driven by their potential to host exotic quantum states. Their unique coexistence often leads to rich physics and potential applications in quantum technologies. Here, we predict cubic Nd3In as an exceptional candidate in this class, combining strong-coupling superconductivity with distinctive topological features. Using first-principles calculations, we find that the strong-coupling superconductivity in Nd3In arises primarily due to pronounced Fermi surface nesting, leading to an electron-phonon coupling constant of lambda = 1.39. Our fully anisotropic Migdal-Eliashberg analysis predicts a superconducting transition temperature Tc approximate to 14 K at ambient pressure, which is the highest value reported so far among cubic semimetallic superconductors. When subjected to a pressure of 15 GPa, Tc increases further to 18 K. Beyond superconductivity, Nd3In is found to be a Weyl semimetal, as evidenced by the presence of Fermi arcs and nontrivial Z2 topological invariants, confirming its topological nature. The combination of strong-coupling superconductivity and nontrivial topological states makes Nd3In a promising candidate for quantum transport and topological quantum computation.

TI Noisy Approach to Intrinsically Mixed-State Topological Order
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB We propose a general framework for studying two-dimensional (2D) topologically ordered states subject to local correlated errors and show that the resulting mixed state can display intrinsically mixed-state topological order (imTO)-topological order that is not expected to occur in the ground state of 2D local gapped Hamiltonians. Specifically, we show that decoherence, previously interpreted as anyon condensation in a doubled Hilbert space, is more naturally phrased as, and provides a physical mechanism for, "gauging out" anyons in the original Hilbert space. We find that gauging out anyons generically results in imTO, with the decohered mixed state strongly symmetric under certain anomalous 1-form symmetries. This framework lays bare a striking connection between the decohered density matrix and topological subsystem codes, which can appear as anomalous surface states of three-dimensional topological orders. Through a series of examples, we show that the decohered state can display a classical memory, encode logical qubits (i.e., exhibit a quantum memory), and even host chiral or nonmodular topological order. We argue that a partial classification of imTO is given in terms of nonmodular braided-fusion categories.

AB Bulk acoustic resonators can be fabricated on the same substrate as other components and can operate at various frequencies with high quality factors. Mechanical dynamic metrology of these devices is challenging as the surface information available through laser Doppler vibrometry lacks information about the acoustic energy stored in the bulk of the resonator. Here we report the spin-acoustic control of naturally occurring negatively charged silicon monovacancies in a lateral overtone bulk acoustic resonator that is based on 4H silicon carbide. We show that acoustic driving can be used at room temperature to induce coherent population oscillations. Spin-acoustic resonance is shown to be useful as a frequency-tunable probe of bulk acoustic wave resonances, highlighting the dynamical strain distribution inside a bulk acoustic wave resonator at ambient operating conditions. Our approach could be applied to the characterization of other high-quality-factor microelectromechanical systems and has the potential to be used in mechanically addressable quantum memory.
   Acoustically driven spin control of silicon monovacancies can be used to measure the resonant properties and dynamical strain distribution in lateral overtone bulk acoustic resonators.

TI The Effect of the Width of the Incident Pulse to the Dielectric
   Transition Layer in the Scattering of an Electromagnetic Pulse - a Qubit
   Lattice Algorithm Simulation
SO COMMUNICATIONS IN COMPUTATIONAL PHYSICS
AB The effect of the thickness of the dielectric boundary layer that connects a material of refractive index n(1) to another of index n(2) is considered for the propagation of an electromagnetic pulse. A qubit lattice algorithm (QLA), which consists of a spe-cially chosen non-commuting sequence of collision and streaming operators acting on a basis set of qubits, is theoretically determined that recovers the Maxwell equations to second-order in a small parameter epsilon. For very thin but continuous boundary layer the scattering properties of the pulse mimics that found from the Fresnel discontinuous jump conditions for a plane wave -except that the transmission to incident ampli-tudes are augmented by a factor of root n(2)/n(1). As the boundary layer becomes thicker one finds deviations away from the discontinuous Fresnel conditions and eventually one approaches the expected WKB limit. However there is found a small but unusual dip in part of the transmitted pulse that persists in time. Computationally, the QLA simulations still recover the solutions to Maxwell equations even when this parame-ter epsilon -> 1. On examining the pulse propagation in medium n(1), epsilon corresponds to the dimensionless speed of the pulse (in lattice units).

TI Non-Gaussian feature of the output field from a double qubit-cavity
   ultrastrong coupling system
SO COMMUNICATIONS IN THEORETICAL PHYSICS
AB We investigate the non-Gaussian feature of radiation in a circuit quantum electrodynamics (QED) system where two qubits are strongly coupled to a single-mode cavity. In the regime of ultrastrong coupling (USC), the rotating-wave approximation is not valid, and the Rabi Hamiltonian contains counter-rotating wave terms, leading to level crossing and avoided crossings in the energy spectrum. We further analyze the intensity-amplitude correlation of the output field in these two novel scenarios. In the USC regime, the creation and annihilation operators in the correlation function are replaced, allowing for the identification of non-Gaussian features in the output field. Our findings reveal that despite the absence of squeezing effects in the output light, significant non-Gaussian characteristics are present. Additionally, we demonstrate that as the driving or coupling strength increases, the non-Gaussian features of the output field become more pronounced. This suggests that USC systems hold broad potential applications in the realms of nonlinear optics and the generation of non-Gaussian states.

TI Energy landscape shaping for robust control of atoms in optical lattices
SO NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB Robust quantum control is crucial for realizing practical quantum technologies. Energy landscape shaping offers an alternative to conventional dynamic control, providing theoretically enhanced robustness and simplifying implementation for certain applications. This work demonstrates the feasibility of robust energy landscape control in a practical implementation with ultracold atoms. We leverage a digital mirror device (DMD) to shape optical potentials, creating complex energy landscapes. To achieve a desired objective, such as efficient quantum state transfer, we formulate a novel hybrid optimization approach that effectively handles both continuous (laser power) and discrete (DMD pixel activation) control parameters. This approach combines constrained quasi-Newton methods with surrogate models for efficient exploration of the vast parameter space. Furthermore, we introduce a framework for analyzing the robustness of the resulting control schemes against experimental uncertainties. By modeling uncertainties as structured perturbations, we systematically assess controller performance and identify robust solutions. We apply these techniques to maximize spin transfer in a chain of trapped atoms, achieving high-fidelity control while maintaining robustness. Our findings provide insights into the experimental viability of controlled spin transfer in cold atom systems. More broadly, the presented optimization and robustness analysis methods apply to a wide range of quantum control problems, offering a toolkit for designing and evaluating robust controllers in complex experimental settings.

TI Quantum tensor singular value decomposition
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICS COMMUNICATIONS
AB Tensors are increasingly ubiquitous in various areas of applied mathematics and computing, and tensor decompositions are of practical significance and benefit many applications in data completion, image processing, computer vision, collaborative filtering, etc. Recently, Kilmer and Martin propose a new tensor factorization strategy, tensor singular value decomposition (t-svd), which extends the matrix singular value decomposition to tensors. However, computing t-svd for high dimensional tensors costs much computation and thus cannot efficiently handle large scale datasets. Motivated by advantage of quantum computation, in this paper, we present a quantum algorithm of t-svd for third-order tensors and then extend it to order-p tensors. We prove that our quantum t-svd algorithm for a third-order N dimensional tensor runs in time.(N polylog(N)) if we do not recover classical information from the quantum output state. Moreover, we apply our quantum t-svd algorithm to context-aware multidimensional recommendation systems, where we just need to extract partial classical information from the quantum output state, thus achieving low time complexity.

TI Current induced hidden states in Josephson junctions
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Josephson junctions enable dissipation-less electrical current through metals and insulators below a critical current. Despite being central to quantum technology based on superconducting quantum bits and fundamental research into self-conjugate quasiparticles, the spatial distribution of super current flow at the junction and its predicted evolution with current bias and external magnetic field remain experimentally elusive. Revealing the hidden current flow, featureless in electrical resistance, helps understanding unconventional phenomena such as the nonreciprocal critical current, i.e., Josephson diode effect. Here we introduce a platform to visualize super current flow at the nanoscale. Utilizing a scanning magnetometer based on nitrogen vacancy centers in diamond, we uncover competing ground states electrically switchable within the zero-resistance regime. The competition results from the superconducting phase re-configuration induced by the Josephson current and kinetic inductance of thin-film superconductors. We further identify a new mechanism for the Josephson diode effect involving the Josephson current-induced phase. The nanoscale super current flow emerges as a new experimental observable for elucidating unconventional superconductivity, and optimizing quantum computation and energy-efficient devices.

TI Utilizing direct Zener tunneling in Germanium for cryogenic quantum

SO MATERIALS SCIENCE IN SEMICONDUCTOR PROCESSING
AB The temperature-dependent electroluminescent properties of Ge-Diodes, especially the Ge-Zener-Emitter, with tunnel transitions are investigated. The direct band-gap behavior of Germanium below a temperature of 140 K is demonstrated, facilitated by Zener tunneling. Pulsed excitation of the Ge-Zener-Emitter results in an optical output power density of 6 mu W, which is sufficient to excite quantum dots for single-photon emission. The peak energy of 0.86 eV suits the non-resonant excitation of InGaAs quantum dots at cryogenic temperatures. This paper presents a potential optical pump source for a quantum photonic integrated circuit.

TI Algorithmic Theory of Qu bit Routing in the Linear Nearest Neighbor
   Architectures
SO ACM TRANSACTIONS ON QUANTUM COMPUTING
AB The qubit routing problem, also known as the swap minimization problem, is a (classical) combinatorial optimization problem that arises in the design of compilers of quantum programs. We study the qubit routing problem from the viewpoint of theoretical computer science, while most of the existing studies investigated the practical aspects. We concentrate on the linear nearest neighbor (LNN) architectures of quantum computers, in which the graph topology is a path. Our results are three-fold. (1) We prove that the qubit routing problem is NP-hard. (2) We show that the qubit routing problem on a path can be solved in a fixed-parameter time where the number of two-qubit gates is a parameter. (3) We show that the qubit routing problem on a path can be solved in polynomial time if each qubit is involved in at most one two-qubit gate.

TI Forecasting steam mass flow in power plants using the parallel hybrid
   network
SO ENGINEERING APPLICATIONS OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE
AB Efficient and sustainable power generation is a crucial concern in the energy sector. In particular, thermal power plants grapple with accurately predicting steam mass flow, which is crucial for operational efficiency and cost reduction. In this study, we use a parallel hybrid neural network architecture that combines a parameterized quantum circuit and a conventional feed-forward neural network specifically designed for time-series prediction in industrial settings to enhance predictions of steam mass flow 15 min into the future. Our results show that the parallel hybrid model outperforms standalone classical and quantum models, achieving more than 5.7 and 4.9 times lower mean squared error loss on the test set after training compared to pure classical and pure quantum networks, respectively. Furthermore, the hybrid model demonstrates smaller relative errors between the ground truth and the model predictions on the test set, up to 2 times better than the pure classical model. These findings contribute to the broader scientific understanding of how integrating quantum and classical machine learning techniques can be applied to real-world challenges faced by the energy sector, ultimately leading to optimized power plant operations. To our knowledge, this study constitutes the first parallel hybrid quantum-classical architecture deployed on a real-world power-plant dataset, illustrating how near-term quantum resources can already augment classical analytics in the energy sector.

TI In vacuum metasurface for optical microtrap array
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB Optical tweezer arrays of laser-cooled and individually controlled particles have revolutionized atomic, molecular, and optical physics. They afford exquisite capabilities for applications in quantum simulation of many-body physics, quantum computation, and sensing. Underlying this development is the technical maturity of generating scalable optical beams, enabled by active components and a high numerical aperture objective. However, such a complex combination of bulk optics outside the vacuum chamber is very sensitive to any vibration and drift. Here, we demonstrate the generation of a 3 x 3 static tweezer array with a single chip-scale multifunctional metasurface element in vacuum, replacing the meter-long free space optics. Fluorescence counts on the camera validate the successful trapping of the atomic ensemble array and showcase a promising strategy for integrated photonics with cold atom systems. The introduction of a polarization independent dual-wavelength metasurface significantly enhances fluorescence collection efficiency while reducing experimental complexity. This approach paves the way for scalable neutral atom platforms and offers a compelling route towards the realization of next generation quantum metasurfaces.

TI Review of Biphoton Sources Based on the Double-Λ Spontaneous Four-Wave
   Mixing Process
SO ADVANCED QUANTUM TECHNOLOGIES
AB This review article focuses on biphoton sources based on the double-Lambda spontaneous four-wave mixing (SFWM) process in laser-cooled as well as room-temperature or hot atomic ensembles. These biphoton sources have the advantage of providing stable frequencies, ultranarrow linewidths, and a tunability of the temporal biphoton width of more than one order of magnitude for high-bandwidth applications. Therefore, the generated photons can be efficiently interfaced to, e.g., atomic quantum memories. In contrast, solid-state biphoton sources typically require assistance by an optical cavity to operate at narrow linewidth that limits the tunability of the temporal width of the biphotons. Present state-of-the-art double-Lambda SFWM biphoton sources can achieve one of the following results: a spectral linewidth of 50 kHz (290 kHz) or a temporal width of 13 mu s (580 ns) with cold (hot) atoms, a detection rate of about 7x10(3) cps, and a generation rate of 10(7) cps at a duty cycle of 0.4% or of 10(5) cps in the steady state. The theoretical background of these biphoton sources, experimental implementations with cold and hot atoms, and progress over the years, will be illustrated.

TI Tweezer-Assisted Subwavelength Positioning of Atomic Arrays in an

SO PRX QUANTUM
AB We present an experimental technique that enables the preparation of defect-free arrays of 87Rb atoms within a microscopic high-finesse optical standing-wave cavity. By employing optical tweezers, we demonstrate atom positioning with a precision well below the cavity wavelength, a crucial requirement for cavity-QED experiments in which maximum atom-cavity coupling strength is required. We leverage our control capabilities to assemble an array of up to seven atoms with an efficiency that exceeds previous probabilistic methods by 4 orders of magnitude. The atoms are subsequently transferred from the tweezer array to a two-dimensional intracavity optical lattice that offers enhanced coherence for spin qubits while maintaining strong atom confinement. Our system overcomes the efficiency limitations of previous probabilistic loading techniques of cavity-coupled atom arrays and opens the path to multiqubit quantum networks with atoms strongly coupled to optical cavities.

TI Non-gaussian operations in different modes of pair coherent state
SO PHYSICA SCRIPTA
AB A study of non-Gaussian operations in a single/two-mode quantum state is of great importance because of the enhancement of non-classicality. Experimental evidence of the generation of a Pair Coherent State (PCS) and the feasibility of non-Gaussian operations using beam splitters and nonlinear crystals motivated us to study non-Gaussian PCS. Recently, we studied various nonclassicality criteria in a particular case of non-Gaussian PCS. Here, we explore different combinations of photon addition/subtraction in either mode of PCS. For example, we studied photon addition and subtraction (PAS), photon subtraction and addition (PSA), photon addition and addition (PAA), and photon subtraction and subtraction (PSS) in two modes of PCS. We present a quantitative measure of nonclassicality in the form of inequality known as Klyshko's criterion for the different combinations of PCS to show the nonclassical behavior of the states quantitatively. Here, we also present the corresponding coefficients (Cn) for each different case of PCS and analyze the effect of photon addition and subtraction on the photon-number distribution, linear entropy, single-photon source efficiency (SPS), Q-function, and fidelity for quantum teleportation. We illustrate our results through numerical simulations and compare them with standard PCS. We observe the changes induced by different combinations in PCS, leading to enhanced nonclassicality. Our results show that the PSA and PSS configurations demonstrate the strongest Klyshko nonclassicality, while the PAA state exhibits maximal entanglement via linear entropy and strong efficiency. In particular, the PAS state achieves the highest teleportation fidelity (F > 0.88). These findings establish photon-added/subtracted PCS as practical and tunable resources for quantum communication and metrology tasks.

TI Dual-Matrix Domain Wall: A Novel Technique for Generating Permutations
   by QUBO and Ising Models with Quadratic Sizes
SO TECHNOLOGIES
AB The Ising model is defined by an objective function using a quadratic formula of qubit variables. The problem of an Ising model aims to determine the qubit values of the variables that minimize the objective function, and many optimization problems can be reduced to this problem. In this paper, we focus on optimization problems related to permutations, where the goal is to find the optimal permutation out of the n! possible permutations of n elements. To represent these problems as Ising models, a commonly employed approach is to use a kernel that applies one-hot encoding to find any one of the n! permutations as the optimal solution. However, this kernel contains a large number of quadratic terms and high absolute coefficient values. The main contribution of this paper is the introduction of a novel permutation encoding technique called the dual-matrix domain wall, which significantly reduces the number of quadratic terms and the maximum absolute coefficient values in the kernel. Surprisingly, our dual-matrix domain-wall encoding reduces the quadratic term count and maximum absolute coefficient values from n3-n2 and 2n-4 to 6n2-12n+4 and 2, respectively. We also demonstrate the applicability of our encoding technique to partial permutations and Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) models. Furthermore, we discuss a family of permutation problems that can be efficiently implemented using Ising/QUBO models with our dual-matrix domain-wall encoding.

TI From pixels to camera: scaling superconducting nanowire single-photon
   detectors for imaging at the quantum-limit
SO NANO CONVERGENCE
AB Superconducting nanowire single-photon detectors (SNSPDs) have emerged as essential devices that push the boundaries of photon detection with unprecedented sensitivity, ultrahigh timing precision, and broad spectral response. Recent advancements in materials engineering, superconducting electronics integration, and cryogenic system design are enabling the evolution of SNSPDs from single-pixel detectors toward scalable arrays and large-format single-photon time tagging cameras. This perspective article surveys the rapidly evolving technological landscape underpinning this transition, focusing on innovative superconducting materials, advanced multiplexed read-out schemes, and emerging cryo-compatible electronics. We highlight how these developments are set to profoundly impact diverse applications, including quantum communication networks, deep-tissue biomedical imaging, single-molecule spectroscopy, remote sensing with unprecedented resolution, and the detection of elusive dark matter signals. By critically discussing both current challenges and promising solutions, we aim to articulate a clear, coherent vision for the next generation of SNSPD-based quantum imaging systems.

AB Quantum Bridge Analytics relates to methods and systems for hybrid classical-quantum computing, and is devoted to developing tools for bridging classical and quantum computing to gain the benefits of their alliance in the present and enable enhanced practical application of quantum computing in the future. This is the second of a two-part tutorial that surveys key elements of Quantum Bridge Analytics and its applications. Part I focused on the Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) model which is presently the most widely applied optimization model in the quantum computing area, and which unifies a rich variety of combinatorial optimization problems. Part II (the present paper) introduces the domain of QUBO-Plus models that enables a larger range of problems to be handled effectively. After illustrating the scope of these QUBO-Plus models with examples, we give special attention to an important instance of these models called the Asset Exchange Problem (AEP). Solutions to the AEP enable market players to identify exchanges of assets that benefit all participants. Such exchanges are generated by a combination of two optimization technologies for this class of QUBO-Plus models, one grounded in network optimization and one based on a new metaheuristic optimization approach called combinatorial chaining. This combination opens the door to expanding the links to quantum computing applications established by QUBO models through the Quantum Bridge Analytics perspective. We show how the modeling and solution capability for the AEP instance of QUBO-Plus models provides a framework for solving a broad range of problems arising in financial, industrial, scientific, and social settings.

TI Minimum-time generation of a uniform superposition in a qubit with only
   transverse field control
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB We consider a two-level system with a fixed energy spacing (detuning) between the two levels and a single transverse control field which can take values between zero and a maximum amplitude. Using Pontryagin's maximum principle, we completely solve the problem of generating in minimum time a uniform superposition of the two quantum states when starting from one of them, for all the values of the ratio between the maximum control amplitude and the detuning. For each value of this ratio we find the optimal pulse sequence to have the bang-bang form and calculate the durations of the pulses composing it. The suggested framework is not only restricted to the problem at hand, but it can be also exploited in the problem of fast charging a quantum battery based on a two-level system, as well as for the optimization of pulse sequences used for the controlled preparation of the excited state in a quantum emitter, which is a prerequisite for its usage as a single-photon source.

TI Controlling Atom-Photon Bound States in an Array of Josephson-Junction
   Resonators
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW X
AB Engineering the electromagnetic environment of a quantum emitter gives rise to a plethora of exotic light -matter interactions. In particular, photonic lattices can seed long-lived atom-photon bound states inside photonic band gaps. Here, we report on the concept and implementation of a novel microwave architecture consisting of an array of compact superconducting resonators in which we have embedded two frequency -tunable artificial atoms. We study the atom-field interaction and access previously unexplored coupling regimes, in both the single-and double-excitation subspace. In addition, we demonstrate coherent interactions between two atom-photon bound states, in both resonant and dispersive regimes, that are suitable for the implementation of SWAP and CZ two-qubit gates. The presented architecture holds promise for quantum simulation with tunable-range interactions and photon transport experiments in the nonlinear regime.

AB The teaching of quantum technologies has now become a leading topic and is at the heart of numerous international programs (e.g., quantum flagship, National Quantum Initiative, UK national quantum technology program) with the aim of widening the workforce and preparing the next generations of experts. In the present contribution, we present an approach for teaching the Second Quantum Revolution to secondary school students that we developed in recent years. The approach aims to emphasize the ongoing revolution as first of all a cultural revolution and its intrinsic interdisciplinary character. As an emblematic case of some aspects of the approach, we present an activity on the classical and quantum random walk algorithms whose main aims are to recontextualize some basic quantum concepts (quantum state, state manipulation/evolution, measurement, and entanglement) in the case of the algorithm and to reflect on the main differences between the classical and quantum case in terms of logic behind its functioning as well as from an epistemological perspective.

TI Practical parallel self-testing of Bell states via magic rectangles
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Self-testing is a method to verify that one has a particular quantum state from purely classical statistics. For practical applications, such as device-independent delegated verifiable quantum computation, it is crucial that one self-tests multiple Bell states in parallel while keeping the quantum capabilities required of one side to a minimum. In this work, we use the 3xn magic rectangle games (generalizations of the magic square game) to obtain a self-test for n Bell states where the one side needs only to measure single-qubit Pauli observables. The protocol requires small input sizes [constant for Alice and O(log(2) n) bits for Bob] and is robust with robustness O(n(5/2)root epsilon), where epsilon is the closeness of the ideal (perfect) correlations to those observed. To achieve the desired self-test, we introduce a one-side-local quantum strategy for the magic square game that wins with certainty, we generalize this strategy to the family of 3xn magic rectangle games, and we supplement these nonlocal games with extra check rounds (of single and pairs of observables).

TI Environmental quantum states trigger emission in nonlinear photonics
SO COMMUNICATIONS PHYSICS
AB Light-matter interactions are traditionally governed by two fundamental paradigms: spontaneous and stimulated radiation. However, in a nonlinear bath with photon-photon interactions, these paradigms break down, revealing new possibilities for photon emission. Here, we show a mechanism, termed triggered emission, in which an emitter, largely detuned from single-photon states, is triggered by the environment's quantum state to emit a highly correlated photon pair, a doublon. By identifying two critical conditions, energy matching and wavefunction overlap, we demonstrate that the dynamics of the emitter are profoundly shaped by the environment's quantum state. Furthermore, by engineering the initial environment photonic state and constructing a quasi-giant emitter, we realize partial unidirectional emission which evolves into a superposition state comprising a localized single-photon and a unidirectionally propagating, strongly correlated two-photon wavepacket. Our findings not only deepen the understanding of nonlinear emitter dynamics but also provide a versatile platform for quantum computing and quantum information processing.

TI Introduction to Semi-Classical Analysis for Digital Errors of Qubit in
   Quantum Processor
SO ENTROPY
AB In recent years, remarkable progress has been achieved in the development of quantum computers. For further development, it is important to clarify properties of errors by quantum noise and environment noise. However, when the system scale of quantum processors is expanded, it has been pointed out that a new type of quantum error, such as nonlinear error, appears. It is not clear how to handle such new effects in information theory. First of all, one should make the characteristics of the error probability of qubits clear as communication channel error models in information theory. The purpose of this paper is to survey the progress for modeling the quantum noise effects that information theorists are likely to face in the future, to cope with such nontrivial errors mentioned above. This paper explains a channel error model to represent strange properties of error probability due to new quantum noise. By this model, specific examples on the features of error probability caused by, for example, quantum recurrence effects, collective relaxation, and external force, are given. As a result, it is possible to understand the meaning of strange features of error probability that do not exist in classical information theory without going through complex physical phenomena.

TI Activation of entanglement in generalized entanglement swapping
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB We study entanglement activation in a generalized entanglement swapping process involving two Bell pairs and generalized measurements. The conventional understanding posits entangled measurements as both necessary and sufficient for establishing entanglement between distant parties. In this study, we reassess the role of measurement operators in entanglement generation within a generalized entanglement swapping process. We focus on maximally entangled two-qubit initial states and generalized measurements, investigating the necessity and sufficiency conditions for entangled measurement operators. By utilizing two Bell pairs, (1, 2) shared between Alice and Bob, and (3, 4) shared between Bob and Charlie, we demonstrate that while entangled measurements are sufficient, they are not indispensable for establishing entanglement between spatially separated observers. Through a sequential approach, if Bob performs an initial measurement which is not able to establish entanglement then followed by another measurement after postprocessing the first measurement it is possible to establish entanglement. We identify specific criteria for different measurement operators that enable the potential for performing a second measurement to establish entanglement. Our findings highlight the feasibility of generating entanglement between distant parties through a combination of measurements, shedding light on entanglement distribution in quantum networks. Additionally, we showcase through illustrative examples how successive measurements enhance entanglement compared to single measurements, underscoring the practical benefits of our approach in enhancing entanglement. Moreover, our protocol extends beyond bipartite qubit states to higher-dimensional maximally entangled states, emphasizing its versatility and applicability.

TI Degenerate local-dimension-invariant stabilizer codes and an alternative
   bound for the distance preservation condition
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB One hurdle to performing reliable quantum computations is overcoming noise. One possibility is to reduce the number of particles needing to be protected from noise and instead use systems with more states, so-called qudit quantum computers. In this paper we show that codes for these systems can be derived from already known codes, and, in particular, that degenerate stabilizer codes can have their distance also promised upon sufficiently large local dimension as well as an alternative bound on the local dimension required to preserve the distance of local-dimension-invariant codes, which is a result which could prove to be useful for error-corrected qudit quantum computers.

TI Efficient excitation-transfer across fully connected networks via
   local-energy optimization
SO EPJ QUANTUM TECHNOLOGY
AB We study the excitation transfer across a fully connected quantum network whose sites energies can be artificially designed. Starting from a simplified model of a broadly-studied physical system, we systematically optimize its local energies to achieve high excitation transfer for various environmental conditions, using an adaptive Gradient Descent technique and Automatic Differentiation. We show that almost perfect transfer can be achieved with and without local dephasing, provided that the dephasing rates are not too large. We investigate our solutions in terms of resilience against variations in either the network connection strengths, or size, as well as coherence losses. We highlight the different features of a dephasing-free and dephasing-driven transfer. Our work gives further insight into the interplay between coherence and dephasing effects in excitation-transfer phenomena across fully connected quantum networks. In turn, this will help designing optimal transfer in artificial open networks through the simple manipulation of local energies.

TI Spin-phonon relaxation of boron vacancy centers in two-dimensional boron
   nitride polytypes
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
AB Two-dimensional (2D) materials hosting color centers and spin defects are emerging as key platforms for quantum technologies. However, the impact of reduced dimensionality on the spin-lattice relaxation time (T1) of embedded defect spins-critical for quantum applications-has remained largely unexplored. In this study, we present a systematic first-principles investigation of the negatively charged boron-vacancy (V-B) defect in monolayer boron nitride (BN), as well as in AA'-stacked hexagonal BN (hBN) and ABC-stacked rhombohedral BN (rBN). Our results reveal that the T1 times of V-B in monolayer BN and hBN are nearly identical at room temperature. Surprisingly, despite the symmetry reduction in rBN that opens additional spin relaxation channels, V-B exhibits a longer T1 compared to hBN. We attribute this effect to the stiffer out-of-plane phonon modes in rBN, which activate spin-phonon relaxation at reduced strength. These findings suggest that V-B in rBN offers enhanced spin coherence properties, making it a promising candidate for quantum technology applications.

AB Considered sensitive information by the ISO/IEC 24745, biometric data should be stored and used in a protected way. If not, privacy and security of end-users can be compromised. Also, the advent of quantum computers demands quantum-resistant solutions. This work proposes the use of Kyber and Saber public key encryption (PKE) algorithms together with homomorphic encryption (HE) in a face recognition system. Kyber and Saber, both based on lattice cryptography, were two finalists of the third round of NIST post-quantum cryptography standardization process. After the third round was completed, Kyber was selected as the PKE algorithm to be standardized. Experimental results show that recognition performance of the non-protected face recognition system is preserved with the protection, achieving smaller sizes of protected templates and keys, and shorter execution times than other HE schemes reported in literature that employ lattices. The parameter sets considered achieve security levels of 128, 192 and 256 bits.

TI Optical single-shot readout of spin qubits in silicon
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Small registers of spin qubits in silicon can exhibit hour-long coherence times and exceeded error-correction thresholds. However, their connection to larger quantum processors is an outstanding challenge. To this end, spin qubits with optical interfaces offer key advantages: they can minimize the heat load and give access to modular quantum computing architectures that eliminate cross-talk and offer a large connectivity. Here, we implement such an efficient spin-photon interface based on erbium dopants in a nanophotonic resonator. We demonstrate optical single-shot readout of a spin in silicon whose coherence exceeds the Purcell-enhanced optical lifetime, paving the way for entangling remote spins via photon interference. As erbium dopants can emit coherent photons in the minimal-loss band of optical fibers, and tens of such qubits can be spectrally multiplexed in each resonator, the demonstrated hardware platform offers unique promise for distributed quantum information processing based on scalable, integrated silicon devices.

AB Nonlocality and its connections to entanglement are fundamental features of quantum mechanics that have found numerous applications in quantum information science. A set of correlations is said to be nonlocal if it cannot be reproduced by spacelike-separated parties sharing randomness and performing local operations. An important practical consideration is that the runtime of the parties has to be shorter than the time it takes light to travel between them. One way to model this restriction is to assume that the parties are computationally bounded. We therefore initiate the study of nonlocality under computational assumptions and derive the following results: (a) We define the set NEL (not-efficiently-local) as consisting of all bipartite states whose correlations arising from local measurements cannot be reproduced with shared randomness and polynomial-time local operations. (b) Under the assumption that the Learning With Errors problem cannot be solved in quantum polynomial-time, we show that NEL=ENT, where ENT is the set of all bipartite entangled states (pure and mixed). This is in contrast to the standard notion of nonlocality where it is known that some entangled states, e.g. Werner states, are local. In essence, we show that there exist (efficient) local measurements producing correlations that cannot be reproduced through shared randomness and quantum polynomial-time computation. (c) We prove that if NEL=ENT unconditionally, then BQP not equal PP. In other words, the ability to certify all bipartite entangled states against computationally bounded adversaries gives a non-trivial separation of complexity classes. (d) Using (c), we show that a certain natural class of 1-round delegated quantum computation protocols that are sound against PP provers cannot exist.

TI Quantum spectral clustering algorithm for unsupervised learning
SO SCIENCE CHINA-INFORMATION SCIENCES
AB Clustering is one of the most crucial problems in unsupervised learning, and the well-known k-means algorithm can be implemented on a quantum computer with a significant speedup. However, for the clustering problems that cannot be solved using the k-means algorithm, a powerful method called spectral clustering is used. In this study, we propose a circuit design to implement spectral clustering on a quantum processor with substantial speedup by initializing the processor into a maximally entangled state and encoding the data information into an efficiently simulatable Hamiltonian. Compared to the established quantum k-means algorithms, our method does not require a quantum random access memory or a quantum adiabatic process. It relies on an appropriate embedding of quantum phase estimation into Grover's search to gain the quantum speedup. Simulations demonstrate that our method effectively solves clustering problems and is an important supplement to quantum k-means algorithm for unsupervised learning.

TI Two-photon decay enhanced even photon bundle emission
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Multiquanta emission holds significant value for quantum computing and quantum information processing. In this study, we aim to enhance multiphoton bundle emission by introducing two-photon decay into cavity quantum electrodynamics systems. By implementing parity protection induced by two-photon decay in the quantum jump process, we achieve complete suppression of odd photon emissions, resulting in high-purity, high-efficiency 2n-photon bundle emission characterized by photon bunching and bundle antibunching. Our results indicate that this scheme can effectively produce 2n-photon sources. Unlike previous methods that enhanced 2n-photon bundle purity via parity protection during unitary processes which required ultrastrong cavity-atom coupling, this study is the first to focus on parity protection during nonunitary processes to improve emission purity. This innovative approach not only relaxes the ultrastrong coupling condition compared to earlier schemes, but it also opens new research directions for enhancing N-photon bundle emission. Furthermore, this work has the potential to advance the fields of multiphoton physics and parity theory.

TI Sudden death of quantum advantage in correlation generations
SO SCIENCE ADVANCES
AB Quantum noise is one of the most profound obstacles to implementing large-scale quantum algorithms and schemes. In particular, the dynamical process by which quantum noise, varying in strength from 0 to critical levels, affects and destroys quantum advantage has not been well understood. Meanwhile, correlation generation serves as a precious theoretical model for information processing tasks, where quantum advantage can be precisely quantified. In this study, we show that this model provides valuable insights into the understanding of this dynamical process. We prove that, as the strength of quantum noise continuously increases from 0, the quantum advantage diminishes gradually and eventually vanishes. Unexpectedly, in some cases, we observe the phenomenon of a sudden death of quantum advantage: When the noise strength exceeds a certain threshold, the quantum advantage abruptly disappears from a substantial level. This phenomenon, once again, reveals the tremendous impact of noise on quantum information processing tasks.

TI Dispersive vacuum as a decoherence amplifier of an Unruh-DeWitt detector
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICS A-MATHEMATICAL AND THEORETICAL
AB Recently, interest has been growing in studies on discrete or 'pixelated' space-time that, through modifications in the dispersion relation, can treat the vacuum as a dispersive medium. Discrete spacetime considers that spacetime has a cellular structure on the order of the Planck length, and if this is true we should certainly have observable effects. In this paper, we investigated the effects caused by the dispersive vacuum on the decoherence process of an Unruh-DeWitt detector, our setup consists of a uniformly accelerated detector, initially in a qubit state, which interacts with a massless scalar field during a time interval finite. We use dispersion relations drawn from doubly special relativity and Ho & rcaron;ava-Lifshitz gravity, with these modifications the vacuum becomes dispersive and has a corresponding refractive index. We calculate the probability transition rates, the probability of finding the detector in the ground state, and the quantum coherence variation. Our results indicate that the decoherence process occurs more quickly in cases with changes in the dispersion relation in the regime of high accelerations and interaction time. Additionally, the decoherence increases as the vacuum becomes more dispersive due to the increase in the order of modification in the dispersion relation, and this happens because the dispersive vacuum amplifies the effects of quantum fluctuations that are captured by the detector when interacting with the field.

AB Among the fourth round finalists of the NIST post-quantum cryptography standardization process for public-key encryption algorithms and key encapsulation mechanisms, three rely on hard problems from coding theory. Key encapsulation mechanisms are frequently used in hybrid cryptographic systems: a public-key algorithm for key exchange and a secret key algorithm for communication. A major point is thus the initial key exchange that is performed thanks to a key encapsulation mechanism. In this paper, we analyze side-channel vulnerabilities of the key encapsulation mechanism implemented by the Classic McEliece cryptosystem, whose security is based on the syndrome decoding problem. We use side-channel leakages to reduce the complexity of the syndrome decoding problem by reducing the length of the code considered. The columns punctured from the original code reduce the complexity of a hard problem from coding theory. This approach leads to efficient profiled side-channel attacks that recover the session key with high success rates, even in noisy scenarios.

TI Elucidating the local atomic and electronic structure of amorphous
   oxidized superconducting niobium films
SO APPLIED PHYSICS LETTERS
AB Qubits made from superconducting materials are a mature platform for quantum information science application, such as quantum computing. However, material-based losses are now a limiting factor in reaching the coherence times needed for applications. In particular, knowledge of the atomistic structure and properties of the circuit materials is needed to identify, understand, and mitigate material-based decoherence channels. In this work, we characterize the atomic structure of the native oxide film formed on Nb resonators by comparing fluctuation electron microscopy experiments to density functional theory calculations, finding that an amorphous layer is consistent with an Nb2O5 stoichiometry. Comparing x-ray absorption measurements at the Oxygen K edge with first-principles calculations, we find evidence of d-type magnetic impurities in our sample, known to cause impedance in proximal superconductors. This work identifies the structural and chemical composition of the oxide layer grown on Nb superconductors and shows that soft x-ray absorption can fingerprint magnetic impurities in these superconducting systems.

TI Area-Time Efficient Hardware Architecture for CRYSTALS-Kyber
SO APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL
AB This paper presents a novel area-time efficient hardware architecture of the lattice-based CRYSTALS-Kyber, which has entered the third round of the post-quantum cryptography standardization competition hosted by the National Institute of Standards and Technology. By developing a dual-path delay feedback number theoretic transform multiplier dedicating for Kyber parameter set and deploying this multiplier in the Kyber architecture, the key generation, encryption, and decryption operations are accelerated substantially. Furthermore, the proposed architecture offers the best value of area-time product in comparison with existing approaches. The implementation results on Xilinx Vivado targeted for Virtex-7 FPGA board demonstrate that the proposed Kyber cryptoprocessor completes encryption and decryption operations in approximately 57.5 mu s at the highest frequency of 226 MHz. Furthermore, the area-time product value when using the proposed Kyber architecture is improved by at least twofold compared with existing architectures.

TI Ablation loading of barium ions into a surface-electrode trap
SO APPLIED PHYSICS LETTERS
AB Trapped-ion quantum information processing may benefit from qubits encoded in isotopes that are practically available in only small quantities, e.g., due to low natural abundance or radioactivity. Laser ablation provides a method of controllably liberating neutral atoms or ions from low-volume targets, but energetic ablation products can be difficult to confine in the small ion-electrode distance, micron-scale microfabricated traps amenable to high-speed, high-fidelity manipulation of ion arrays. Here, we investigate ablation-based ion loading into surface-electrode traps of different sizes to test a model describing ion loading probability as a function of effective trap volume and other trap parameters. We characterize loading of ablated barium from a metallic source in two cryogenic surface-electrode traps with 730 and 50 mu m ion-electrode distances. Our loading rate agrees with a predictive analytical model, providing insight for the confinement of limited-quantity species of interest for quantum computing, simulation, and sensing.

TI Polarization of Bi2Se3 thin film toward
   non-volatile memory applications
SO AIP ADVANCES
AB In recent years, topological insulators have drawn growing interest as a unique electronic state of matter toward quantum information technology. Despite the logic devices with magnetization switching through spin-orbit torque or the topological magneto-electric effect, realizing memory devices based on topological insulators has been urged in quantum computing applications. In this work, we report the design and fabrication of a non-volatile memory device that employs polarization of Bi2Se3 thin films achieving fast memory speed, sufficient memory window, and good reliability. The Bi2Se3 film polarizes under an external electrical field with charges accumulated on the top and bottom surfaces separating the electrons and holes. Such polarization is much faster than the carrier tunneling in conventional floating-gate flash memory and ferroelectric-based memory devices. In addition, good memory retention and endurance properties have also been obtained, showing great potential in high-performance memory application in future topological insulator-involved information technology.

TI Random Networks with Quantum Boolean Functions
SO MATHEMATICS
AB Simple Summary: Using the paradigm of quantum computation, we propose a novel model similar to random Boolean networks. We study the properties and dynamics of our model and find that these differ non-trivially from those of traditional random Boolean networks.
   We propose quantum Boolean networks, which can be classified as deterministic reversible asynchronous Boolean networks. This model is based on the previously developed concept of quantum Boolean functions. A quantum Boolean network is a Boolean network where the functions associated with the nodes are quantum Boolean functions. We study some properties of this novel model and, using a quantum simulator, we study how the dynamics change in function of connectivity of the network and the set of operators we allow. For some configurations, this model resembles the behavior of reversible Boolean networks, while for other configurations a more complex dynamic can emerge. For example, cycles larger than 2(N) were observed. Additionally, using a scheme akin to one used previously with random Boolean networks, we computed the average entropy and complexity of the networks. As opposed to classic random Boolean networks, where "complex" dynamics are restricted mainly to a connectivity close to a phase transition, quantum Boolean networks can exhibit stable, complex, and unstable dynamics independently of their connectivity.

TI Many-body localization enables iterative quantum optimization
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB There are several proposals for quantum algorithms solving optimisation problems, but so far none of them has provided a clear speedup. Here, the authors propose an iterative protocol featuring periodic cycling around the tricritical point of a many-body localization transition.
   Many discrete optimization problems are exponentially hard due to the underlying glassy landscape. This means that the optimization cost exhibits multiple local minima separated by an extensive number of switched discrete variables. Quantum computation was coined to overcome this predicament, but so far had only a limited progress. Here we suggest a quantum approximate optimization algorithm which is based on a repetitive cycling around the tricritical point of the many-body localization (MBL) transition. Each cycle includes quantum melting of the glassy state through a first order transition with a subsequent reentrance through the second order MBL transition. Keeping the reentrance path sufficiently close to the tricritical point separating the first and second order transitions, allows one to systematically improve optimization outcomes. The running time of this algorithm scales algebraically with the system size and the required precision. The corresponding exponents are related to critical indexes of the continuous MBL transition.

TI The coherence time of sunlight in the context of natural and artificial
   light-harvesting
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB The suggestion that quantum coherence might enhance biological processes such as photosynthesis is not only of fundamental importance but also leads to hopes of developing bio-inspired 'green' quantum technologies that mimic nature. A key question is how the timescale of coherent processes in molecular systems compare to that of the driving light source-the Sun. Across the quantum biology literature on light-harvesting, the coherence time quoted for sunlight spans about two orders of magnitude, ranging from 0.6 to '10s' of femtoseconds. This difference can potentially be significant in deciding whether the induced light-matter coherence is long enough to affect dynamical processes following photoexcitation. Here we revisit the historic calculations of sunlight coherence starting with the black-body spectrum and then proceed to provide values for the more realistic case of atmospherically filtered light. We corroborate these values with interferometric measurements of the complex degree of temporal coherence from which we calculate the coherence time of atmospherically filtered sunlight as 1.12 +/- 0.04 fs, as well as the coherence time in a chlorophyll analogous filtered case as 4.87 +/- 0.21 fs.

TI 14N Hyperfine and nuclear interactions of axial and basal NV
   centers in 4H-SiC: A high frequency (94 GHz) ENDOR study
SO JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYSICS
AB The nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers (NCVSi)(-) in 4H silicon carbide (SiC) constitute an ensemble of spin S = 1 solid state qubits interacting with the surrounding N-14 and Si-29 nuclei. As quantum applications based on a polarization transfer from the electron spin to the nuclei require the knowledge of the electron-nuclear interaction parameters, we have used high-frequency (94 GHz) electron-nuclear double resonance spectroscopy combined with first-principles density functional theory to investigate the hyperfine and nuclear quadrupole interactions of the basal and axial NV centers. We observed that the four inequivalent NV configurations (hk, kh, hh, and kk) exhibit different electron-nuclear interaction parameters, suggesting that each NV center may act as a separate optically addressable qubit. Finally, we rationalized the observed differences in terms of distinctions in the local atomic structures of the NV configurations. Thus, our results provide the basic knowledge for an extension of quantum protocols involving the N-14 nuclear spin.

TI Quantum Power Electronics: From Theory to Implementation
SO INVENTIONS
AB While impressive progress has been already achieved in wide-bandgap (WBG) semiconductors such as 4H-SiC and GaN technologies, the lack of intelligent methodologies to control the gate drivers has prevented exploitation of the maximum potential of semiconductor chips from obtaining the desired device operations. Thus, a potent ongoing trend is to design a fast gate driver switching scheme to upgrade the performance of electronic equipment at the system level. To address this issue, this work proposed a novel intelligent scheme for the control of gate driver switching using the concept of quantum computation in machine learning. In particular, the quantum principle was incorporated into deep reinforcement learning (DRL) to address the hardware limitations of conventional computers and the growing amount of data sets. Taking potential benefit of the quantum theory, the DRL algorithm influenced by quantum specifications (referred to as QDRL) not only ameliorates the performance of the native algorithm on traditional computers but also enhances the progress of relevant research fields like quantum computing and machine learning. To test the practicability and usefulness of QDRL, a dc/dc parallel boost converter feeding constant power loads (CPLs) was chosen as the case study, and several power hardware-in-the-loop (PHiL) experiments and comparative analysis were performed.

TI Fast single atom imaging for optical lattice arrays
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB High-resolution fluorescence imaging of ultracold atoms and molecules is paramount to performing quantum simulation and computation in optical lattices and tweezers. Imaging durations in these experiments typically range from a millisecond to a second, significantly limiting the cycle time. In this work, we present fast, 2.4 mu s single-atom imaging in lattices, with 99.4% fidelity - pushing the readout duration of neutral atom quantum platforms to be close to that of superconducting qubit platforms. Additionally, we thoroughly study the performance of accordion lattices. We also demonstrate number-resolved imaging without parity projection, which will facilitate experiments such as the exploration of high-filling phases in the extended Bose-Hubbard models, multi-band or SU(N) Fermi-Hubbard models, and quantum link models.

TI Biphoton Waveforms of Photon Pair from Velocity-Selective Atoms in a
   Doppler-Broadened Atomic Ensemble
SO ADVANCED PHOTONICS RESEARCH
AB Telecom band photonic quantum states generated from atomic systems are critical quantum resources for long-distance and scalable quantum communication networks. Here, the beat phenomenon in the autocorrelation function of the telecom-wavelength photon due to the velocity-selective classes of the atoms in a Doppler-broadened atomic ensemble of the cascade-type 5S(1/2)-5P(3/2)-4D(5/2) transition of Rb-87 is reported. Although the signal (1529 nm) and idler (780 nm) photons are emitted from a single-atomic ensemble, the autocorrelation functions of the signal and idler photons exhibit significantly different features, with temporal widths of 7 and 0.13 ns, respectively. Furthermore, the biphoton spectral waveform of the telecom band photon pair is measured using a stimulated emission method. The biphoton waveforms of the telecom-wavelength biphoton source demonstrate good agreement with the magnitude of the Fourier components of the measured biphoton temporal and spectral waveforms.

TI Enabling Quantum-Resistant EDHOC: Design and Performance Evaluation
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB The Ephemeral Diffie-Hellman over COSE (EDHOC) is a compact and lightweight key establishment protocol for constrained scenarios that provides end-to-end application layer security context. However, because of the vulnerability of the discrete logarithm problem to Shor's algorithm, a quantum resistant replacement for Diffie-Hellman is required. This paper proposes an architecture to transform EDHOC into a quantum-resistant protocol, with an open-source implementation supporting various Post Quantum Cryptography (PQC) schemes from the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) PQC standardization process. Necessary modifications to EDHOC are analyzed, integrating PQC Key Encapsulation Mechanisms (KEMs) and PQC digital signatures in a complete Post-Quantum (PQ) version of the EDHOC protocol (PQ-EDHOC). PQC operations often involve complex computations and require larger byte sizes, which can challenge resource-constrained devices designed for lightweight operation in constrained network environments. To evaluate the applicability of various PQC schemes in a realistic PQ EDHOC environment, various PQC KEM and Digital Signature combinations are assessed for execution time, energy consumption, memory usage, and network performance on an nRF52840 ARM Cortex-M4 platform with a 6LoWPAN (IPv6 over Low-Power Wireless Personal Area Networks) over BLE (Bluetooth LowEnergy) network. Results indicate that NIST standardized ML-KEM emerges as the only suitable KEM choice for resource-constrained environments, while promising new signature schemes, like HAWK, show significant performance improvement over the NIST standardized ML-DSA and selected for standardization FALCON.

TI Nonreciprocal bipartite and tripartite entanglement in cavity-magnon
   optomechanics via the Barnett effect
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB We theoretically propose a scheme for generating nonreciprocal macroscopic bipartite and tripartite entanglement using the Barnett effect in cavity-magnon optomechanics. The system consists of an optomechanical cavity and a rotatable yttrium iron garnet (YIG) sphere. Our results indicate that under appropriate parameter conditions, both bipartite entanglement and genuine tripartite entanglement can be generated between the cavity mode, mechanical mode, and magnon mode. Moreover, when the YIG sphere rotates, adjusting the magnetic field direction can induce a positive or negative Barnett shift, which leads to the nonreciprocity of entanglement, where entanglement exists in one chosen magnetic field direction and disappears in the other. Meanwhile, the macroscopic tripartite entanglement in the system is robust against thermal noise. Our work provides a possible avenue for quantum information processing, quantum chiral device integration, and multi-node quantum networks construction.

TI Dynamically generated concatenated codes and their phase diagrams
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB We formulate code concatenation as the action of a unitary quantum circuit on an expanding tree geometry and find that for certain classes of gates, applied identically at each node, a binary tree circuit encodes a single logical qubit with code distance that grows exponentially in the depth of the tree. When there is noise in the bulk or at the end of this encoding circuit, the system undergoes a phase transition between a coding phase, where an optimal decoder can successfully recover logical information, and a noncoding phase. Leveraging the tree structure, we combine the formalism of "tensor enumerators" from quantum coding theory with standard recursive techniques for classical spin models on the Bethe lattice to explore these phases. In the presence of bulk errors, the coding phase is a type of spin glass, characterized by a distribution of failure probabilities. When the errors are heralded, the recursion relation is exactly solvable, giving us an analytic handle on the phase diagram.

TI Distant entanglement generation and controllable information transfer
   via magnon-waveguide systems
SO RESULTS IN PHYSICS
AB The generation of entanglement and information distribution among macroscopic systems which are spatially separated are of paramount importance in the realm of quantum networks and quantum communication. In this paper, we propose a scheme that enables the preparation of long-distance entanglement between two magnons and controllable information transfer from a giant atom to either magnon, where the two magnons can be positioned symmetrically or asymmetrically in relation to a giant atom, and all of the magnons and the atom are coupled to a microwave cavity-array waveguide. By considering significant frequency detuning, we can virtually excite photons and establish an indirect interaction between the giant atom and the two magnons. Through the modulation of atom-waveguide coupling rates, we can not only evenly transfer atomic excitation to both magnons, thereby generating maximally entangled states, but also selectively transmit the atomic state to a single magnon. It is our hope that our proposed scheme will prove valuable in the field of quantum communications.

TI Preparing maximally entangled states by monitoring the
   environment-system interaction
SO RESULTS IN PHYSICS
AB A common assumption in an open quantum system is that the noise induced by the environment, due to the interaction between a quantum system and its environment, is responsible for the disappearance of quantum properties. Interestingly, Barreiro et al. (2011) show, experimentally, using an open-system quantum ion traps simulator, an environment state can be engineered and controlled to pump an arbitrary quantum system toward a maximally entangled state and thus can be considered a resource for quantum information processing. Here, we demonstrate this idea to pump an arbitrary maximally mixed state into Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) state by simulating our quantum circuit using one of the IBM Q processors. Barreiro et al. (2011) offer the circuits for the execution of the GHZ pumping. Nevertheless, those are collected gates that are suitable to the trapped-ions platform, so their circuits implementation on the IBM Q devices would result in large depth circuits and thus requires many gates. Consequently, we suggest a different circuit structure that follow similar goals, but have been considered the features of the IBM Q platform.Moreover, we run the simulation of our circuit using the QASM simulator and free-web based interface, IBM Quantum Experience, with and without error mitigation, to investigate the effect of the noise on the preparation of the initial mixed states of the qubits in addition to the population of the target state of the system.

TI Suppression of Motional Dephasing Using State Mapping
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB Rydberg-mediated quantum optics is a useful route toward deterministic quantum information processing based on single photons and quantum networks but is bottlenecked by the fast motional dephasing of Rydberg atoms. Here, we propose and experimentally demonstrate suppressing the motional dephasing by creating an a priori unknown but correct phase to each Rydberg atom in an atomic ensemble. The phase created is exactly proportional to the unknown velocity of the thermal motion, resulting in a condition as if no thermal motion occurs to the Rydberg atom upon the retrieval of the signal photon. Our experiments, though hampered by the noise of lasers and the environment, demonstrate more than one order of magnitude enhancement of the coherence time. The feasibility of realizing long-lived storage of single photons in strongly interacting Rydberg media sheds new light on Rydberg-mediated quantum nonlinear optics.

TI Berry phase effects on the transverse conductivity of Fermi surfaces and
   their detection via spin qubit noise magnetometry
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
AB The quasistatic transverse conductivity of clean Fermi liquids at long wavelengths displays a remarkably universal behavior: it is determined solely by the radius of curvature of the Fermi surface and does not depend on details such as the quasiparticle mass or their interactions. Here we demonstrate that Berry phases do not alter such universality by directly computing the transverse conductivity of two-dimensional electronic systems with Dirac dispersions, such as those appearing in graphene and its chiral multilayer variants. Interestingly, however, such universality ceases to hold at wave vectors comparable to the Fermi radius, where Dirac fermions display a vividly distinct transverse conductivity relative to parabolic Fermions, with a rich wave vector dependence that includes divergences, oscillations, and zeros. We discuss how this can be probed by measuring the T-1 relaxation time of spin qubits, such as NV centers or nuclear spins, placed near such 2D systems.

TI Efficient Preparation of Position⁃Momentum Entanglement Based on
   Spontaneous Parametric Down⁃Conversion
SO CHINESE JOURNAL OF LASERS-ZHONGGUO JIGUANG
AB Objective The position-momentum (EPR) entanglement of two particles is of special importance for fundamental research in quantum physics and quantum information processing. The existing methods for preparing position-momentum entanglement are mainly based on nonlinear crystal and atomic systems. Devices in atomic systems are complex and difficult to adjust, and the efficiency of entangled photons generated by beta-BaB2O4 (BBO) crystals is low. In this study, we first use ghost imaging and ghost interference techniques to achieve efficient generation of position-momentum entangled photons in the periodically polarized potassium titanium phosphate (PPKTP) crystal optical path, and verify the entanglement properties. The sampling time for a single pixel is 10 s, and the experimental setup design is relatively simple. The entangled photon source analyzed in this study can provide assistance for quantum imaging and preparation of super-entangled states. It also demonstrates broad application potential in fields such as quantum information processing and quantum communication protocols. The preparation of EPR entanglement is mainly based on nonlinear effects of the medium. The atoms in crystals and cold atomic clusters are almost stationary, making them ideal media for generating position and momentum entangled photons, given that the mass of photon entanglement does not decrease owing to atomic motion. The existing EPR entanglement preparation methods are mainly based on nonlinear crystal and atomic systems, including spontaneous parametric down-conversion (SPDC) effects based on BBO crystals, spontaneous four-wave mixing (SFWM) effects based on cold atomic systems, and spontaneous Raman scattering (SRS) effects. Experiments have found that high-quality entanglement sources can also be prepared based on the SFWM and SRS effects of thermal atomic systems. The characterization of EPR entanglement can be achieved through ghost imaging and ghost interference. The positional uncertainty can be calculated using ghost imaging data whereas the uncertainty of the displacement can be calculated using ghost interference data. Whether the EPR entanglement inequality is met or not must be verified to evaluate the entanglement degree. The EPR preparation scheme based on atomic systems has a narrow bandwidth of entangled photons at the order of 1 MHz. However, the experimental setup is relatively complex. Among such atomic systems, cold atom systems require multiple lasers for atomic cooling, while the power, frequency, timing, and other parameters of the cooling laser have strict requirements. Thermal atomic systems require a heating device to accurately control the temperature, and the SFWM and SRS effects based on atomic systems require a pump beam and a coupling beam, which have inconsistent wavelengths and high requirements for spatial optical path calibration. Therefore, atomic systems feature a large volume, multiple devices, and complex operations. Nonlinear crystals can operate at room temperature, but the SPDC process of BBO crystals has a lower efficiency in generating entangled photons, which requires a higher pump power, usually exceeding 30 mW. Collecting entangled photons requires a long time to accumulate. The efficiency of PPKTP crystals at room temperature exceeds 10 times that of BBO, requiring low pump power, and making it a better choice for preparing entanglement sources. This study is based on the spontaneous parametric down-conversion effect of PPKTP crystals to prepare an efficient EPR entanglement source.
   The experimental results show that the uncertainty of the position and momentum of the entangled photon pairs calculated through ghost imaging and ghost interference images satisfies the entanglement paradox inequality, thereby verifying the entanglement characteristics. Methods The preparation and characterization of EPR entanglement based on the SPDC effect of PPKTP crystals include the following processes. First, the SPDC effect of the pump light source in the PPKTP crystal is exploited to generate entangled photon pairs. Then, the entangled photon pairs along the path are separated, the imaging object with the signal photon is irradiated, a signal photon is collected using a multimode fiber, and a single photon detector is employed for photon detection. Subsequently, the idle photon is divided into two paths, the power of each path is adjusted using a half-wave plate and a polarizing beam splitter prism, and either imaging or interferometric measurements are taken. After passing through a slit installed on a translation platform, the idle photon enters the fiber coupling head and undergoes position scanning. Photons are collected using a single photon counter and measured in accordance with the signal photons for ghost imaging. The other possibility for the idle photon is to collect photons using a short focal length lens and perform position scanning for ghost interference and measurement in accordance with the signal photon. Finally, the positional and momentum uncertainties are calculated using ghost imaging and ghost interference data, respectively, to verify whether they meet the EPR entanglement inequality and perform entanglement characterization. Results and Discussions The experimental results of ghost imaging and ghost interference are shown in Fig. 3. We established the calibrated theoretical models by fitting the data. Regarding ghost imaging, we fitted the data by performing a convolution of the double slit with a Gaussian function that takes into account the finite size. We compared the resulting fitting curve with the real transfer function of the metal bar to evaluate Delta x. For ghost interference, we first fitted the experimental data by applying a Fourier transformation to the double slits and a tunable parameter for visibility, and compared the fitted curve with the Fourier transformation of the real double slits, thereby obtaining Delta p. The values obtained from experimental measurements are listed in Table 1. We obtained the uncertainties of position and momentum by fitting the ghost images and ghost interference and compared them with the ideal curves, thereby verifying the EPR paradox inequality. The data exhibit clearly both ghost imaging and ghost interference and satisfy the EPR paradox inequality. Conclusions In this study, we implement a two-photon position-momentum entanglement preparation based on the spontaneous parametric down-conversion effect of PPKTP crystals, and use ghost imaging and ghost interference methods for entanglement characterization. By fitting experimental data with theory, we demonstrate that the prepared EPR entangled photon pairs satisfy the entanglement inequality. The principle of this method is reliable, achieving efficient preparation and characterization at room temperature. Only one pump light is needed for preparation, and the device is simple and easy to implement. It can effectively reduce interference from factors such as random jitter of optical components, and has low energy consumption.
   Our EPR entanglement source may have potential application in fields such as quantum imaging, quantum teleportation based on continuous variable entanglement, quantum key distribution, and quantum detection. This efficient method for preparing entangled sources provides a new approach for future applications. In this regard, the Gaussian characteristics of pump light sources may be changed and modulated to further improve the entanglement quality.

TI Estimating distinguishability measures on quantum computers
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB The performance of a quantum information processing protocol is ultimately judged by distinguishability measures that quantify how distinguishable the actual result of the protocol is from the ideal case. The most prominent distinguishability measures are those based on the fidelity and trace distance, due to their physical interpretations. In this paper we propose and review several algorithms for estimating distinguishability measures based on trace distance and fidelity. The algorithms can be used for distinguishing quantum states, channels, and strategies (the last also known in the literature as "quantum combs"). The fidelity-based algorithms offer physical interpretations of these distinguishability measures in terms of the maximum probability with which a single prover (or competing provers) can convince a verifier to accept the outcome of an associated computation. We simulate many of these algorithms by using a variational approach with parameterized quantum circuits. We find that the simulations converge well in both the noiseless and noisy scenarios for all examples considered. Furthermore, the noisy simulations exhibit a parameter noise resilience. Finally, we establish a strong relationship between various quantum computational complexity classes and distance estimation problems.

TI A Hybrid Key Generator Model Based on Multiscale Prime Sieve and
   Quantum-Inspired Approaches
SO APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL
AB This article examines a hybrid generation of cryptographic keys, whose novelty lies in the fusion of a multiscale subkey generation with prime sieve and subkeys inspired by quantum mechanics. It combines number theory with techniques emulated and inspired by quantum mechanics, also based on two demons capable of dynamically modifying the cryptographic model. The integration is structured through the JDL. In fact, a specific information fusion model is used to improve security. As a result, the resulting key depends not only on the individual components, but also on the fusion path itself, allowing for dynamic and cryptographically agile configurations that remain consistent with quantum mechanics-inspired logic. The proposed approach, called quantum and prime information fusion (QPIF), couples a simulated quantum entropy source, derived from the numerical solution of the Schr & ouml;dinger equation, with a multiscale prime number sieve to construct multilevel cryptographic keys. The multiscale sieve, based on recent advances, is currently among the fastest available. Designed to be compatible with classical computing environments, the method aims to contribute to cryptography from a different perspective, particularly during the coexistence of classical and quantum computers. Among the five key generation algorithms implemented here, the ultra-optimised QRNG offers the most effective trade-off between performance and randomness. The results are validated using standard NIST statistical tests. This hybrid framework can also provide a conceptual and practical basis for future work on PQC aimed at addressing the challenges posed by the quantum computing paradigm.

TI Optimal spatial searches with long-range tunneling
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB A quantum walk on a lattice is a paradigm of a quantum search in a database. The database qubit strings are the lattice sites, qubit rotations are tunneling events, and the target site is tagged by an energy shift. For quantum walks on a continuous time, the walker diffuses across the lattice and the search ends when it localizes at the target site. The search time T can exhibit Grover's optimal scaling with the lattice size N, namely, T similar to root N, on an all-connected, complete lattice. For finite-range tunneling between sites, instead, Grover's optimal scaling is warranted when the lattice is a hypercube of d > 4 dimensions. Here, we show that Grover's optimum can be reached in lower dimensions on lattices of long-range interacting particles, when the interaction strength scales algebraically with the distance r as 1/r(alpha) and 0 < alpha < 3d/2. For alpha < d the dynamics mimics the one of a globally connected graph. For d < alpha < d + 2, the quantum search on the graph can be mapped to a short-range model on a hypercube with spatial dimension d(s) = 2d/(alpha - d), indicating that the search is optimal for d(s) > 4. Our work identifies an exact relation between criticality of long-range and short-range systems, it provides a quantitative demonstration of the resources that long-range interactions provide for quantum technologies, and indicates when existing experimental platforms can implement efficient analog quantum search algorithms.

TI Observation of Non-Hermitian Topology with Nonunitary Dynamics of
   Solid-State Spins
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB Non-Hermitian topological phases exhibit a number of exotic features that have no Hermitian counterparts, including the skin effect and breakdown of the conventional bulk-boundary correspondence. Here, we implement the non-Hermitian Su-Schrieffer-Heeger Hamiltonian, which is a prototypical model for studying non-Hermitian topological phases, with a solid-state quantum simulator consisting of an electron spin and a C-13 nuclear spin in a nitrogen-vacancy center in a diamond. By employing a dilation method, we realize the desired nonunitary dynamics for the electron spin and map out its spin texture in the momentum space, from which the corresponding topological invariant can be obtained directly. From the measured spin textures with varying parameters, we observe both integer and fractional winding numbers. The non-Hermitian topological phase with fractional winding number cannot be continuously deformed to any Hermitian topological phase and is intrinsic to non-Hermitian systems. Our result paves the way for further exploiting and understanding the intriguing properties of non-Hermitian topological phases with solid-state spins or other quantum simulation platforms.

TI Lightweight Hardware Implementation of Binary Ring-LWE PQC Accelerator
SO IEEE COMPUTER ARCHITECTURE LETTERS
AB Significant innovation has been made in the development of public-key cryptography that is able to withstand quantum attacks, known as post-quantum cryptography (PQC). This paper focuses on the development of an efficient PQC hardware implementation. Specifically, an implementation of the binary Ring-teaming-with-errors (BRLWE)-based encryption scheme, a promising lightweight PQC suitable for resource-constrained applications, is proposed. The paper first develops the mathematical formulation to present the proposed algorithmic process. The corresponding hardware accelerators are then described in detail. Finally, comparisons with previous implementations are provided to demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed design. For instance, the proposed low-complexity accelerator has 34.7% less area-delay product (ADP) than the state-of-the-art design for n = 256 in the field-programmable gate array (FPGA) platform. Apart from the efficiency of the hardware architectures, the proposed design also has a complete input/output processing setup, and thus is feasible for emerging lightweight applications.

TI Criteria for optimal entanglement-assisted long baseline telescopy
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Entanglement-assisted telescopy protocols have been proposed as a means to extend the baseline of optical interferometric telescopes. However, the optimal entangled resource and a clear optimality criterion have remained unclear. Here, we propose a framework for systematically characterizing entanglement-assisted telescopy by integrating quantum metrology tools with the superselection rule (SSR) framework from quantum information theory. In our approach, the estimation problem in quantum telescopy is rigorously quantified using the quantum Fisher information under SSR constraints. Building on this framework, we derive the fundamental limits of astronomical parameter estimation with finite entanglement resources and introduce protocols that outperform previous methods and asymptotically saturate the optimal bound. Moreover, our proposed protocols are compatible with existing linear-optical technology and could inspire practical quantum telescopy schemes for near-term, lossy, and repeaterless quantum networks.

TI Robust preparation of many-body ground states in Jaynes-Cummings
   lattices
SO NPJ QUANTUM INFORMATION
AB Strongly correlated polaritons in Jaynes-Cummings (JC) lattices can exhibit quantum phase transitions between the Mott-insulating and superfluid phases at integer fillings. The prerequisite to observe such phase transitions is to pump polariton excitations into a JC lattice and prepare them into appropriate ground states. Despite previous efforts, it is still challenging to generate many-body states with high accuracy. Here, we present an approach for the robust preparation of many-body ground states of polaritons in finite-sized JC lattices by optimized nonlinear ramping. We apply a Landau-Zener type of estimation to this finite-sized system and derive the optimal ramping index for selected ramping trajectories, which can greatly improve the fidelity of the prepared states. With numerical simulation, we show that by choosing an appropriate ramping trajectory, the fidelity in this approach can remain close to unity in almost the entire parameter space. This approach can shed light on high-fidelity state preparation in quantum simulators and advance the implementation of quantum simulation with practical devices.

TI Modeling and Performance Evaluation of Hybrid Classical-Quantum
   Serverless Computing Platforms
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON QUANTUM ENGINEERING
AB While quantum computing technologies are evolving toward achieving full maturity, hybrid algorithms, such as variational quantum computing, are already emerging as valid candidates to solve practical problems in fields, such as chemistry and operations research. This situation calls for a tighter and better integration of classical and quantum computing infrastructures to improve efficiency and users' quality of service. Inspired by recent developments in cloud technologies, serverless computing has recently been considered a promising solution for this purpose by both industry and research. In this work, we define a system model for a hybrid classical-quantum serverless system, with an associated open-source numerical simulator that can be driven by production traces and stochastic workload models. We therefore describe how we produced a public dataset using IBM Qiskit in a local and remote infrastructure, with a sample application on optimization. The simulation results show initial insights on some distinguishing features of the platform simulated, measured in terms of user and system metrics, for jobs with heterogeneous problem sizes and priorities. We also report a few lessons we learned from developing the application with IBM Qiskit serverless and running it on IBM Quantum backends.

TI Quantum simulations with multiphoton Fock states
SO NPJ QUANTUM INFORMATION
AB Quantum simulations are becoming an essential tool for studying complex phenomena, e.g. quantum topology, quantum information transfer and relativistic wave equations, beyond the limitations of analytical computations and experimental observations. To date, the primary resources used in proof-of-principle experiments are collections of qubits, coherent states or multiple single-particle Fock states. Here we show a quantum simulation performed using genuine higher-order Fock states, with two or more indistinguishable particles occupying the same bosonic mode. This was implemented by interfering pairs of Fock states with up to five photons on an interferometer, and measuring the output states with photon-number-resolving detectors. Already this resource-efficient demonstration reveals topological matter, simulates non-linear systems and elucidates a perfect quantum transfer mechanism which can be used to transport Majorana fermions.

TI Improving the stimulated Raman adiabatic passage efficiency for
   ultracold 6Li40K ground state molecules
SO COMMUNICATIONS PHYSICS
AB Ultracold polar molecules represent a rapidly advancing platform at the forefront of quantum simulation, quantum computation, quantum chemistry, and precision measurement. We report an experimental investigation for improving the creation efficiency of ultracold 6Li40K ground state molecules using stimulated Raman adiabatic passage (STIRAP). We address laser amplitude/phase noise and polarization impurity to improve STIRAP efficiency. The phase noise of our two Raman lasers is suppressed effectively by extending the cavity length for the external-cavity diode lasers (ECDLs). Further, we find that even a weak polarization impurity significantly reduces the STIRAP efficiency on the single-photon resonance (Delta = 0) for 6Li40K, due to coupling to undesired molecular levels. However, STIRAP efficiencies over 90% can be achieved by increasing Delta/2 pi to 10 MHz, which is comparable to the excited-state scattering rate. Our work holds significance for achieving efficient STIRAP transfer in ultracold molecules with unresolved excited-state hyperfine splittings and large scattering rates.

TI Enhancing trust of deep learning models with post-quantum digital
   signatures
SO JOURNAL OF SUPERCOMPUTING
AB High-performance computing (HPC) is crucial for artificial intelligence (AI) and deep learning (DL) but faces challenges related to scalability, data transfer costs, and security risks. Federated Learning (FL) enables collaborative model training without centralized data aggregation. However, FL introduces vulnerabilities, as exchanged models can be intercepted and manipulated, necessitating robust cryptographic protection. With the advent of quantum computing, traditional security mechanisms are at risk, requiring the adoption of Post-Quantum Cryptographic (PQC) algorithms. This study benchmarks three PQC digital signature algorithms: Falcon, SPHINCS+, and ML-DSA. Their execution time, memory usage, and computational efficiency are evaluated in a simulated FL setting. To extend the analysis, different cryptographic hash functions (SHA3-256, SHA3-512, and BLAKE3) are analyzed to assess hashing efficiency under varying computational loads. Both centralized and decentralized FL scenarios are simulated, incorporating PQC-based digital signatures at each phase of the communication pipeline to ensure model integrity and authenticity. The results provide insights into the trade-offs between security and computational overhead, guiding the selection of scalable cryptographic solutions for FL. Falcon and ML-DSA demonstrate minimal impact on computational performance, making them strong candidates for securing FL environments. Future research directions include the direct signing of DL models to enhance security and the integration of widely used FL libraries for more realistic evaluations. These advancements could improve the practical deployment of post-quantum security solutions in FL, ensuring resilience against emerging quantum threats.

TI A quantum-resilient lattice-based security framework for internet of
   medical things in healthcare systems
SO JOURNAL OF KING SAUD UNIVERSITY COMPUTER AND INFORMATION SCIENCES
AB The rapid adoption of Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) devices enables real-time patient monitoring and remote diagnostics and has revolutionized healthcare delivery. Traditional cryptographic schemes like RSA and ECC, which rely on meaningful mathematical challenges, are under great threat from quantum computing, threatening sensitive medical data confidentiality and integrity. This paper proposes a quantum-resistant healthcare security framework based on lattice-based cryptographic primitives such as Learning With Errors (LWE), Ring-LWE (RLWE), and Short Integer Solution (SIS). To this end, we design a five-phase IoMT-friendly framework-Initialization, Registration, Authentication, Data Exchange, and Treatment-where each phase is backed up by lightweight cryptography primitives that can be easily implemented on the low-resource IoMT devices. Relative to the state-of-the-art lattice- and hash-based constructions, our framework involves 50-75% smaller ciphertext sizes, up to a 50% reduction of the communication overhead, and nearly 60% less in computational cost. Furthermore, the solution relies on zero-knowledge proofs, homomorphic encryption as well and attribute-based access control to guarantee strong security and privacy. Using the AVISPA tool, the framework is formally verified, showing its resistance against classical and quantum adversaries. Focusing on tangible healthcare threats, including data tampering and unlicensed access to patient diagnostics, this research paves the way for scalable, efficient, and quantum-resistant medical data protection. Our results pave the way for future investigations into secure post-quantum healthcare and IoT applications.

TI Probabilistic Unitary Synthesis with Optimal Accuracy
SO ACM TRANSACTIONS ON QUANTUM COMPUTING
AB The purpose of unitary synthesis is to find a gate sequence that optimally approximates a target unitary transformation. A new synthesis approach, called probabilistic synthesis, has been introduced, and its superiority has been demonstrated over traditional deterministic approaches with respect to approximation error and gate length. However, the optimality of current probabilistic synthesis algorithms is unknown. We obtain the tight lower bound on the approximation error obtained by the optimal probabilistic synthesis, which guarantees the sub-optimality of current algorithms. We also show its tight upper bound, which improves and unifies current upper bounds depending on the class of target unitaries. These two bounds reveal the fundamental relationship of approximation error between probabilistic approximation and deterministic approximation of unitary transformations. From a computational point of view, we show that the optimal probability distribution can be computed by the semidefinite program (SDP) we construct. We also construct an efficient probabilistic synthesis algorithm for single-qubit unitaries, rigorously estimate its time complexity, and show that it reduces the approximation error quadratically compared with deterministic algorithms.

TI Optimal training of finitely sampled quantum reservoir computers for
   forecasting of chaotic dynamics
SO QUANTUM MACHINE INTELLIGENCE
AB In the current Noisy Intermediate Scale Quantum (NISQ) era, the presence of noise deteriorates the performance of quantum computing algorithms. Quantum reservoir computing (QRC) is a type of quantum machine learning algorithm, which, however, can benefit from different types of tuned noise. In this paper, we analyze how finite sampling noise affects the chaotic time series prediction of the gate-based QRC and recurrence-free quantum reservoir computing (RF-QRC) models. First, we examine RF-QRC and show that, even without a recurrent loop, it contains temporal information about previous reservoir states using leaky integrated neurons. This makes RF-QRC different from quantum extreme learning machines (QELM). Second, we show that finite sampling noise degrades the prediction capabilities of both QRC and RF-QRC while affecting QRC more due to the propagation of noise. Third, we optimize the training of the finite-sampled quantum reservoir computing framework using two methods: (a) singular value decomposition (SVD) applied to the data matrix containing noisy reservoir activation states and (b) data-filtering techniques to remove the high frequencies from the noisy reservoir activation states. We show that denoising reservoir activation states improves the signal-to-noise ratios with smaller training loss. Finally, we demonstrate that the training and denoising of the noisy reservoir activation signals in RF-QRC are highly parallelizable on multiple quantum processing units (QPUs) as compared to the QRC architecture with recurrent connections. The analyses are numerically showcased on prototypical chaotic dynamical systems with relevance to turbulence. This work opens opportunities for using quantum reservoir computing with finite samples for time series forecasting on near-term quantum hardware.

SO ELECTRONICS
AB This paper analyzes the performance requirements that need to be met by a clock generator applied to a low-temperature quantum computer and analyzes the negative effects on the clock generator circuit under low-temperature conditions. In order to meet the performance requirements proposed in this paper and suppress the negative effects brought about by the low temperature, a clock generator for ultra-low-temperature quantum computing is designed. This clock generator is designed by using F-CLASS Voltage Controlled Oscillator (VCO), power filter, tail resistor, differential charge pump, and other techniques. And the noise characteristics of the clock generator are analyzed by Impulse Sensitive Function (ISF) and simulation results. After simulation tests, the average power consumption of the clock generator designed in this paper is 7 mW, the phase noise is -121 dBc/Hz@1 MHz, and the jitter is 62 fs. The performance of the clock generator meets the performance requirements proposed in this paper, and the reduction in the corner frequency proves that the circuit will have better performance at low temperatures.

TI Quantum-Secure Coherent Optical Networking for Advanced Infrastructures
   in Industry 4.0
SO INFORMATION
AB Modern industrial ecosystems, particularly those embracing Industry 4.0, increasingly depend on coherent optical networks operating at 400 Gbps and beyond. These high-capacity infrastructures, coupled with advanced digital signal processing and phase-sensitive detection, enable real-time data exchange for automated manufacturing, robotics, and interconnected factory systems. However, they introduce multilayer security challenges-ranging from hardware synchronization gaps to protocol overhead manipulation. Moreover, the rise of large-scale quantum computing intensifies these threats by potentially breaking classical key exchange protocols and enabling the future decryption of stored ciphertext. In this paper, we present a systematic vulnerability analysis of coherent optical networks that use OTU4 framing, Media Access Control Security (MACsec), and 400G ZR+ transceivers. Guided by established risk assessment methodologies, we uncover critical weaknesses affecting management plane interfaces (e.g., MDIO and I2C) and overhead fields (e.g., Trail Trace Identifier, Bit Interleaved Parity). To mitigate these risks while preserving the robust data throughput and low-latency demands of industrial automation, we propose a post-quantum security framework that merges spectral phase masking with multi-homodyne coherent detection, strengthened by quantum key distribution for key management. This layered approach maintains backward compatibility with existing infrastructure and ensures forward secrecy against quantum-enabled adversaries. The evaluation results show a substantial reduction in exposure to timing-based exploits, overhead field abuses, and cryptographic compromise. By integrating quantum-safe measures at the optical layer, our solution provides a future-proof roadmap for network operators, hardware vendors, and Industry 4.0 stakeholders tasked with safeguarding next-generation manufacturing and engineering processes.

TI Self-Assembled InAs Quantum Dots on InGaAsP/InP(100) by Modified Droplet
   Epitaxy in Metal-Organic Vapor Phase Epitaxy around the Telecom C-Band
   for Quantum Photonic Applications
SO PHYSICA STATUS SOLIDI-RAPID RESEARCH LETTERS
AB The growth of InAs quantum dots (QDs) by droplet epitaxy (DE) in metal-organic vapor phase epitaxy is demonstrated for the first time on an InGaAsP layer lattice matched to InP(100). The nucleation of indium droplets on InGaAsP shows a strong dependence on the deposition temperature, with an unexpectedly low density, pointing to a strongly increased surface diffusion compared to bare InP or InGaAs surfaces previously reported. Droplets and surface morphology are characterized via atomic force microscopy and scanning electron microscopy. Droplet crystallization into InAs QDs is explored, where the crystallization process follows a modified DE growth which resembles the one on InGaAs but strongly differs from bare InP. Also, no formation of quantum dashes (QDashes) is observed, as the DE growth technique used here allows for a better control of QD nucleation, decoupled from the layer/epilayer mismatch, favoring the formation of QDs over QDashes. Optical characterizations suggest a more efficient carrier capture into the QDs if these are grown on InGaAsP compared to InGaAs. Finally, bright single-dot emission at low-temperature is detected from QDs ranging from 1300 to 1600 nm, covering the technologically relevant telecom C-band.
   The modified droplet epitaxy (DE) of telecom InAs quantum dots (QDs) is demonstrated for the first time on an InGaAsP layer lattice matched on InP in metal-organic vapor phase epitaxy. The formation of quantum dashes is inhibited by DE, which decouples the QD nucleation from the layer/epilayer mismatch. Bright single-dot emission at the telecom C-band is observed.image & COPY; 2023 WILEY-VCH GmbH

AB The computation power of quantum computers introduces new security threats in Public Key Infrastructure (PKI), a system used by many governments to secure their digital public services and communication. This calls for an inevitable need for governments to be quantum-safe (QS) by modifying their PKI systems to be resistant to the attacks of quantum computers. However, there is limited academic literature on a QS PKI system, and in this limited literature, the transition challenges are perceived as exclusively technological. This paper aims to create a structured overview of challenges when transitioning to a QS PKI system. We do this by reviewing literature and classifying the challenges using Technology-Organization-Environment (TOE) framework and using an expert workshop to explore the challenges in the context of the PKI system in the Dutch government. The main challenges in the technological context include no universal QS solution, legacy system, complex PKI interoperability, and vulnerable Root CA. The main challenges in the organizational context include knowledge gap, unclear governance, lack of urgency, and in-house management support. Furthermore, the main challenges in the environmental context include institutional void, stakeholder collaboration, lack of awareness, and policy guidance. The results indicate that the QS transition from the current PKI system is complex, and the challenges are socio-technical. For policy-makers, this implies that they should start early to prepare, whereas organizations are hardly aware of the process of QS transition and the topic of quantum computing is yet to develop the urgency in organizations.

   from monolayer WS2
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Two-dimensional hexagonal materials such as transition metal dichalcogenides exhibit valley degrees of freedom, offering fascinating potential for valley-based quantum computing and optoelectronics. In nonlinear optics, the K and K' valleys provide excitation resonances that can be used for ultrafast control of excitons, Bloch oscillations, and Floquet physics. Under intense laser fields, however, the role of coherent carrier dynamics away from the K/K' valleys is largely unexplored. In this study, we observe quantum interferences in high harmonic generation from monolayer WS2 as laser fields drive electrons from the valleys across the full Brillouin zone. In the perturbative regime, interband resonances at the valleys enhance high harmonic generation through multi-photon excitations. In the strong-field regime, the high harmonic generation is sensitively controlled by quantum interferences of laser-field-driven electrons occupying various points in the Brillouin zone, including regions far from the K/K' valleys. Our experimental observations are in strong agreement with quantum simulations, validating their interpretation. This work proposes new routes for harnessing laser-driven quantum interference in two-dimensional hexagonal systems and all-optical techniques to occupy and read-out electronic structures in the full Brillouin zone via strong-field nonlinear optics, advancing quantum technologies.

TI Decoherence-free many-body Hamiltonians in nonlinear waveguide quantum
   electrodynamics
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Enhancing interactions in many-body quantum systems, while protecting them from environmental decoherence, is at the heart of many quantum technologies. Waveguide quantum electrodynamics is a promising platform for achieving this, as it hosts infinite-range interactions and decoherence-free subspaces of quantum emitters. However, as coherent interactions between emitters are typically washed out in the wavelength-spacing regime hosting decoherence-free states, coherent control over the latter becomes limited, and many-body Hamiltonians in this important regime remain out of reach. Here we show that by incorporating emitter arrays with nonlinear waveguides hosting parametric gain, we obtain a unique class of many-body interaction Hamiltonians with coupling strengths that increase with emitter spacing, and persist even for wavelength-spaced arrays. We then propose to use these Hamiltonians to coherently generate decoherence-free states directly from the ground state, using only global squeezing drives, without the need for local addressing of individual emitters. Interestingly, we find that the dynamics approaches a unitary evolution in the limit of weak intrawaveguide squeezing, and we discuss potential experimental realizations of this effect. Our results pave the way towards coherent control protocols in waveguide quantum electrodynamics, with applications including quantum computing, simulation, memory, and nonclassical light generation.

TI Probing the Atomic Arrangement of Subsurface Dopants in a Silicon
   Quantum Device Platform
SO ACS APPLIED MATERIALS & INTERFACES
AB High-density structures of subsurface phosphorus dopants in silicon continue to garner interest as a silicon-based quantum computer platform; however, a much-needed confirmation of their dopant arrangement has been lacking. In this work, we take advantage of the chemical specificity of X-ray photoelectron diffraction to obtain the precise structural configuration of P dopants in subsurface Si:P 6-layers. The growth of 6-layer systems with different levels of doping is carefully studied and verified using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and low-energy electron diffraction. Subsequent diffraction measurements reveal that in all cases, the subsurface dopants primarily substitute with Si atoms from the host material. Furthermore, no signs of carrier-inhibiting P-P dimerization can be observed. Our observations not only settle a nearly decade-long debate about the dopant arrangement but also demonstrate how X-ray photoelectron diffraction is surprisingly well suited for studying subsurface dopant structure. This work thus provides valuable input for an updated understanding of the behavior of Si:P 6-layers and the modeling of their derived quantum devices.

TI Measurement-Induced Power-Law Negativity in an Open Monitored Quantum
   Circuit
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB Generic many-body systems coupled to an environment lose their quantum entanglement due to decoherence and evolve to a mixed state with only classical correlations. Here, we show that measurements can stabilize quantum entanglement within open quantum systems. Specifically, in random unitary circuits with dephasing at the boundary, we find both numerically and analytically that projective measurements performed at a small nonvanishing rate result in a steady state with an L1/3 power-law scaling entanglement negativity within the system. Using an analytical mapping to a statistical mechanics model of directed polymers in a random environment, we show that the power-law negativity scaling can be understood as Kardar-Parisi-Zhang fluctuations due to the random measurement locations. Further increasing the measurement rate leads to a phase transition into an area-law negativity phase, which is of the same universality as the entanglement transition in monitored random circuits without decoherence.

TI Schmidt decomposition of parity adapted coherent states for symmetric
   multi-quDits
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICS A-MATHEMATICAL AND THEORETICAL
AB In this paper we study the entanglement in symmetric N-quDit systems. In particular we use generalizations to U(D) of spin U(2) coherent states (CSs) and their projections on definite parity (sic) is an element of Z(2)(D-1) (multicomponent Schrodinger cat) states and we analyse their reduced density matrices when tracing out M < N quDits. The eigenvalues (or Schmidt coefficients) of these reduced density matrices are completely characterized, allowing to prove a theorem for the decomposition of a N-quDit Schrodinger cat state with a given parity c into a sum over all possible parities of tensor products of Schrodinger cat states of N - M and M particles. Diverse asymptotic properties of the Schmidt eigenvalues are studied and, in particular, for the (rescaled) double thermodynamic limit (N, M -> infinity, M/N fixed), we reproduce and generalize to quDits known results for photon loss of parity adapted CSs of the harmonic oscillator, thus providing an unified Schmidt decomposition for both multi-quDits and (multimode) photons. These results allow to determine the entanglement properties of these states and also their decoherence properties under quDit loss, where we demonstrate the robustness of these states.

TI Microwave Package Design for Superconducting Quantum Processors
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB Solid-state qubits with transition frequencies in the microwave regime, such as superconducting qubits, are at the forefront of quantum information processing. However, high-fidelity, simultaneous control of superconducting qubits at even a moderate scale remains a challenge, partly due to the complexities of packaging these devices. Here, we present an approach to microwave package design focusing on material choices, signal line engineering, and spurious mode suppression. We describe design guidelines validated using simulations and measurements used to develop a 24-port microwave package. Analyzing the qubit environment reveals no spurious modes up to 11 GHz. The material and geometric design choices enable the package to support qubits with lifetimes exceeding 350 mu s. The microwave package design guidelines presented here address many issues relevant for near-term quantum processors.

TI Theory of optical spin-polarization of axial divacancy and
   nitrogen-vacancy defects in 4H-SiC
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB The neutral divacancy and the negatively charged nitrogen-vacancy defects in 4H-silicon carbide (SiC) are two of the most prominent candidates for functioning as room-temperature quantum bits (qubits) with telecommunication-wavelength emission. Nonetheless, the pivotal role of electron-phonon coupling in the spinpolarization loop is still unrevealed. In this work, we theoretically investigate the microscopic magneto-optical properties and spin-dependent optical loops utilizing the first-principles calculations. First, we quantitatively demonstrate the electronic level structure, assisted by symmetry analysis. Moreover, the fine interactions, including spin-orbit coupling and spin-spin interaction, are fully characterized to provide versatile qubit functional parameters. Subsequently, we explore the electron-phonon coupling, encompassing dynamics- and pseudo-JahnTeller effects in the intersystem crossing transition. In addition, we analyze the photoluminescence lifetime based on the major transition rates in the optical spin-polarization loop. We compare two promising qubits with similar electronic properties, but their respective rates differ substantially. Finally, we detail the threshold of the optically detected magnetic resonance (ODMR) contrast for further optimization of the qubit operation. This work not only reveals the mechanism underlying the optical spin-polarization but also proposes productive avenues for optimizing quantum information processing tasks based on the ODMR protocol.

TI Programmable simulations of molecules and materials with reconfigurable
   quantum processors
SO NATURE PHYSICS
AB Simulations of quantum chemistry and quantum materials are believed to be among the most important applications of quantum information processors. However, realizing practical quantum advantage for such problems is challenging because of the prohibitive computational cost of programming typical problems into quantum hardware. Here we introduce a simulation framework for strongly correlated quantum systems represented by model spin Hamiltonians that uses reconfigurable qubit architectures to simulate real-time dynamics in a programmable way. Our approach also introduces an algorithm for extracting chemically relevant spectral properties via classical co-processing of quantum measurement results. We develop a digital-analogue simulation toolbox for efficient Hamiltonian time evolution using digital Floquet engineering and hardware-optimized multi-qubit operations to accurately realize complex spin-spin interactions. As an example, we propose an implementation based on Rydberg atom arrays. In addition, we show how detailed spectral information can be extracted from the dynamics through snapshot measurements and single-ancilla control, enabling the evaluation of excitation energies and finite-temperature susceptibilities from a single dataset. To illustrate the approach, we show how to use the method to compute key properties of a polynuclear transition-metal catalyst and two-dimensional magnetic materials.

TI Exponentially faster preparation of quantum dimers via
   driven-dissipative stabilization
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB We propose a rapid, high-fidelity, and noise-resistant scheme to generate many-body entanglement between multiple qubits stabilized by dissipation into a 1D bath. Using a carefully designed time-dependent drive, our scheme achieves a provably exponential speedup over state-of-the-art dissipative stabilization schemes in 1D baths, which require a timescale that diverges as the target fidelity approaches unity and scales exponentially with the number of qubits. To prepare quantum dimer pairs, our scheme only requires local 2-qubit control Hamiltonians, with a protocol time that is independent of system size. This provides a scalable and robust protocol for generating a large number of entangled dimer pairs on-demand, serving as a fundamental resource for many quantum metrology and quantum information processing tasks.

TI Phonon-number resolution of voltage-biased mechanical oscillators with

SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Observing quantum phenomena in macroscopic objects, and the potential discovery of a fundamental limit in the applicability of quantum mechanics, has been a central topic of modern experimental physics. Highly coherent and heavy micromechanical oscillators controlled by superconducting circuits are a promising system for this task. Here we focus in particular on the electrostatic coupling of motion to a weakly anharmonic circuit, namely, the transmon qubit. In the case of a megahertz mechanical oscillator coupled to a gigahertz transmon, we explain the difficulties in bridging the large electromechanical frequency gap. To remedy this issue, we explore the requirements to reach phonon-number resolution in the resonant coupling of a megahertz transmon and a mechanical oscillator.

TI Generation of tomographic measurement data of mesoscopic quantum states
SO OPTICA QUANTUM
AB Microscopic Schr & ouml;dinger cat states are generated from quantum-correlated fields using a probabilistic heralding photon subtraction event. Subsequent quantum state tomography provides complete information about the state, revealing numbers of quantum-correlated photons of the order of one. Optical quantum computing requires even more sophisticated states with significantly higher photon numbers. Here, we present a concept to derive tomographic "measurement" data of states with average quantum-correlated photon numbers significantly larger than one without having these states available. We generate a photon-subtracted squeezed vacuum state of light and simultaneously measure a pair of orthogonal field quadratures. Subsequent data post-processing emulates the optical interference of two copies. One of the interference results is accepted as the new "measurement" value if the second interference result falls below a threshold value. Evaluating the final tomographic data shows that two iterations of the breeding protocol increase the mean photon number of the state from approximate to 1 to approximate to 4. Our concept for obtaining tomographic measurement data of mesoscopic non-classical states that physically never existed provides a way to benchmark future quantum technologies.

TI Temporally correlated quantum noise in driven quantum systems with
   applications to quantum gate operations
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB The ubiquitous effects of the environment on quantum-mechanical systems generally cause temporally correlated fluctuations. This particularly holds for systems of interest for quantum computation where such effects lead to correlated errors. The Markovian approximation neglects these correlations and thus fails to accurately describe open-system dynamics where these correlations become relevant. In driven open systems, yet another approximation is persistently used, often unknowingly, in which one describes the decay effects independently from the time-dependent controlling fields acting on the system, thereby ignoring further temporally correlated effects. To overcome these shortcomings, we develop a quantum master equation for driven systems weakly coupled to quantum environments that avoids the aforementioned field-independent approximation, as well as the Markovian approximation. Our method makes it possible to track all occurring decay channels and their time-dependent generalized rates which we illustrate in the example of a generally driven two-level system. We also demonstrate that correlated and field-dependent dissipative effects can lead to an increase in the performance of single-qubit gate operations.

TI Probing nS/nD Rydberg States via 6P3/2
   Intermediate Level Using Electromagnetically Induced Transparency in
   87Rb
SO PHOTONICS
AB We perform precise measurements of the Rb-87 Rydberg excitation spectrum by using electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT) in a ladder system. We utilize a two-photon excitation configuration with the probe and control lasers at 420 nm and 1013 nm, respectively. In this work, we employ 6P(3/2), F ' = 3 as an intermediate state to excite the high-lying Rydberg states of the nS and nD series, with principal quantum numbers ranging from n=35 to n=70. To improve the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) in this inverted level scheme (lambda(p)<lambda(c)), we apply a 100 kHz chopping to the control beam, which is followed by a demodulation operated with a lock-in amplifier. Additionally, we verify the ionization energies and determine the quantum defects for the nS and nD series, respectively. Our work offers a database for applications of large-scale quantum simulation and quantum computation with the 87Rb atom array.

TI Robustness of electron charge shuttling: Architectures, pulses, charge
   defects, and noise thresholds
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
AB In semiconductor-based quantum technologies, the capability to shuttle charges between components is profoundly enabling. We numerically simulated various "conveyor-belt" shuttling scenarios for simple Si/SiO2 devices, explicitly modeling the electron's wave function using grid-based split-operator methods and a timedependent 2D potential (obtained from a Poisson solver). This allowed us to fully characterize the electron loss probability and excitation fraction. Remarkably, with as few as three independent electrodes, the process can remain near-perfectly adiabatic even in the presence of pulse imperfection, nearby charge defects, and Johnson-Nyquist noise. Only a substantial density of charge defects, or defects at "adversarial" locations, can catastrophically disrupt the charge shuttling. While we do not explicitly model the spin or valley degrees of freedom, our results from this charge propagation study support the conclusion that conveyor-belt shuttling is an excellent candidate for providing connectivity in semiconductor quantum devices.

TI Deterministic multi-phonon entanglement between two mechanical
   resonators on separate substrates
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Mechanical systems have emerged as a compelling platform for applications in quantum information, leveraging advances in the control of phonons, the quanta of mechanical vibrations. Experiments have demonstrated the control and measurement of phonon states in mechanical resonators, and while dual-resonator entanglement has been demonstrated, more complex entangled states remain a challenge. Here, we demonstrate rapid multi-phonon entanglement generation and subsequent tomographic analysis, using a scalable platform comprising two surface acoustic wave resonators on separate substrates, each connected to a superconducting qubit. We synthesize a mechanical Bell state with a fidelity of F=0.872 +/- 0.002\documentclass[12pt]{minimal} \usepackage{amsmath} \usepackage{wasysym} \usepackage{amsfonts} \usepackage{amssymb} \usepackage{amsbsy} \usepackage{mathrsfs} \usepackage{upgreek} \setlength{\oddsidemargin}{-69pt} \begin{document}$${{{{\mathcal{F}}}}}=0.872\pm 0.002$$\end{document}, and a multi-phonon entangled N = 2 N00N state with a fidelity of F=0.748 +/- 0.008\documentclass[12pt]{minimal} \usepackage{amsmath} \usepackage{wasysym} \usepackage{amsfonts} \usepackage{amssymb} \usepackage{amsbsy} \usepackage{mathrsfs} \usepackage{upgreek} \setlength{\oddsidemargin}{-69pt} \begin{document}$${{{{\mathcal{F}}}}}=0.748\pm 0.008$$\end{document}.

TI Restart uncertainty relation for monitored quantum dynamics
SO PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF
   AMERICA
AB We introduce a time-energy uncertainty relation within the context of restarts in monitored quantum dynamics. Previous studies have established that the mean recurrence time, which represents the time taken to return to the initial state, is quantized as an integer multiple of the sampling time, displaying pointwise discontinuous transitions at resonances. Our findings demonstrate that the natural utilization of the restart mechanism in laboratory experiments, driven by finite data collection time spans, leads to a broadening effect on the transitions of the mean recurrence time. Our proposed uncertainty relation captures the underlying essence of these phenomena, by connecting the broadening of the mean hitting time near resonances, to the intrinsic energies of the quantum system and to the fluctuations of recurrence time. Our uncertainty relation has also been validated through remote experiments conducted on an International Business Machines Corporation (IBM) quantum computer. This work not only contributes to our understanding of fundamental aspects related to quantum measurements and dynamics, but also offers practical insights for the design of efficient quantum algorithms with mid-circuit measurements.

TI Analysis of a tripartite entanglement distribution switch
SO QUEUEING SYSTEMS
AB We study a quantum switch that distributes tripartite entangled states to sets of users. The entanglement switching process requires two steps: First, each user attempts to generate bipartite entanglement between itself and the switch, and second, the switch performs local operations and a measurement to create multipartite entanglement for a set of three users. In this work, we study a simple variant of this system, wherein the switch has infinite memory and the links that connect the users to the switch are identical. This problem formulation is of interest to several distributed quantum applications, while the technical aspects of this work result in new contributions within queueing theory. The state of the system is modeled as continuous-time Markov chain (CTMC), and performance metrics of interest (probability of an empty system, switch capacity, expectation, and variance of the number of qubit-pairs stored) are computed via the solution of a two-dimensional functional equation obtained by reducing it to a boundary value problem on a closed curve. This work is a follow-up of Nain et al. (Proc ACM Measure Anal Comput Syst(POMACS) 4, 2020) where a switch distributing entangled multipartite states to sets of users was studied, but only the switch capacity and the expected number of stored qubits were derived.

TI Deterministic improvements of quantum measurements with grouping of
   compatible operators, non-local transformations, and covariance
   estimates
SO NPJ QUANTUM INFORMATION
AB Obtaining the expectation value of an observable on a quantum computer is a crucial step in the variational quantum algorithms. For complicated observables such as molecular electronic Hamiltonians, one of the strategies is to present the observable as a linear combination of measurable fragments. The main problem of this approach is a large number of measurements required for accurate estimation of the observable's expectation value. We consider three previously studied directions that minimize the number of measurements: (1) grouping commuting operators using the greedy approach, (2) involving non-local unitary transformations for measuring, and (3) taking advantage of compatibility of some Pauli products with several measurable groups. The last direction gives rise to a general framework that not only provides improvements over previous methods but also connects measurement grouping approaches with recent advances in techniques of shadow tomography. Following this direction, we develop two measurement schemes that achieve a severalfold reduction in the number of measurements for a set of model molecules compared to previous state-of-the-art methods.

TI A hybrid quantum-classical neural network for learning transferable
   visual representation
SO QUANTUM SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB State-of-the-art quantum machine learning (QML) algorithms fail to offer practical advantages over their notoriously powerful classical counterparts, due to the limited learning capabilities of QML algorithms, the constrained computational resources available on today's noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices, and the empirically designed circuit ansatz for QML models. In this work, we address these challenges by proposing a hybrid quantum-classical neural network (CaNN), which we call QCLIP, for Quantum Contrastive Language-Image Pre-Training. Rather than training a supervised QML model to predict human annotations, QCLIP focuses on more practical transferable visual representation learning, where the developed model can be generalized to work on unseen downstream datasets. QCLIP is implemented by using CaNNs to generate low-dimensional data feature embeddings followed by quantum neural networks to adapt and generalize the learned representation in the quantum Hilbert space. Experimental results show that the hybrid QCLIP model can be efficiently trained for representation learning. We evaluate the representation transfer capability of QCLIP against the classical Contrastive Language-Image Pre-Training model on various datasets. Simulation results and real-device results on NISQ IBM_Auckland quantum computer both show that the proposed QCLIP model outperforms the classical CLIP model in all test cases. As the field of QML on NISQ devices is continually evolving, we anticipate that this work will serve as a valuable foundation for future research and advancements in this promising area.

TI Construction of Quantum Codes over the Class of Commutative Rings and
   Their Applications to DNA Codes
SO MATHEMATICS
AB Let k, m be positive integers and F-2m be a finite field of order 2(m) of characteristic 2. The primary goal of this paper is to study the structural properties of cyclic codes over the ring S-k = F-2m[v(1),v(2),...,v(k)]/< v(i)(2)-alpha(i)v(i),v(i)v(j)-v(j)v(i)>, for i, j = 1, 2, 3,..., k, where alpha(i) is the non-zero element of F-2m. As an application, we obtain better quantum error correcting codes over the ring S-1 (for k = 1). Moreover, we acquire optimal linear codes with the help of the Gray image of cyclic codes. Finally, we present methods for reversible DNA codes.

TI Developing Quantum Trusted Platform Module (QTPM) to Advance IoT
   Security
SO FUTURE INTERNET
AB Randomness is integral to computer security, influencing fields such as cryptography and machine learning. In the context of cybersecurity, particularly for the Internet of Things (IoT), high levels of randomness are essential to secure cryptographic protocols. Quantum computing introduces significant risks to traditional encryption methods. To address these challenges, we propose investigating a quantum-safe solution for IoT-trusted computing. Specifically, we implement the first lightweight, practical integration of a quantum random number generator (QRNG) with a software-based trusted platform module (TPM) to create a deployable quantum trusted platform module (QTPM) prototype for IoT systems to improve cryptographic capabilities. The proposed quantum entropy as a service (QEaaS) framework further extends quantum entropy access to legacy and resource-constrained devices. Through the evaluation, we compare the performance of QRNG with traditional Pseudo-random Number Generators (PRNGs), demonstrating the effectiveness of the quantum TPM. Our paper highlights the transformative potential of integrating quantum technology to bolster IoT security.

TI Approximating Decision Diagrams for Quantum Circuit Simulation
SO ACM TRANSACTIONS ON QUANTUM COMPUTING
AB Quantum computers promise to solve important problems faster than conventional computers ever could. Underneath is a fundamentally different computational primitive that introduces new challenges for the development of software tools that aid designers of corresponding quantum algorithms. The different computational primitives render classical simulation of quantum circuits particularly challenging. While the logic simulation of conventional circuits is comparatively simple with linear complexity with respect to the number of gates, quantum circuit simulation has to deal with the exponential memory requirements to represent quantum states on non-quantum hardware with respect to the number of qubits. Decision Diagrams (DDs) address this challenge through exploitation of redundancies in matrices and vectors to provide significantly more compact representations in many cases. Moreover, the probabilistic nature of quantum computations enables another angle to tackle the complexity: Quantum algorithms are resistant to some degree against small inaccuracies in the quantum state as these only lead to small changes in the outcome probabilities. We propose to exploit this resistance against (small) errors to gain even more compact decision diagrams. In this work, we investigate the potential of approximation in quantum circuit simulation in detail. To this end, we first present four dedicated schemes that exploit the error resistance and efficiently approximate quantum states represented by decision diagrams. Subsequently, we propose two simulation strategies that utilize those approximations schemes in order to improve the efficiency of DD-based quantum circuit simulation, while, at the same time, allowing the user to control the resulting degradation in accuracy. We empirically show that the proposed approximation schemes reduce the size of decision diagrams substantially and also analytically prove the effect of multiple approximations on the attained accuracy. Eventually, this enables speed-ups of the resulting approximate quantum circuit simulation of up to several orders of magnitudes-again, while controlling the fidelity of the result.

TI Large-scale simulations of Floquet physics on near-term quantum
   computers
SO NPJ QUANTUM INFORMATION
AB Periodically driven quantum systems exhibit a diverse set of phenomena but are more challenging to simulate than their equilibrium counterparts. Here, we introduce the Quantum High-Frequency Floquet Simulation (QHiFFS) algorithm as a method to simulate fast-driven quantum systems on quantum hardware. Central to QHiFFS is the concept of a kick operator which transforms the system into a basis where the dynamics is governed by a time-independent effective Hamiltonian. This allows prior methods for time-independent simulation to be lifted to simulate Floquet systems. We use the periodically driven biaxial next-nearest neighbor Ising (BNNNI) model, a natural test bed for quantum frustrated magnetism and criticality, as a case study to illustrate our algorithm. We implemented a 20-qubit simulation of the driven two-dimensional BNNNI model on Quantinuum's trapped ion quantum computer. Our error analysis shows that QHiFFS exhibits not only a cubic advantage in driving frequency omega but also a linear advantage in simulation time t compared to Trotterization.

TI Kerr nonlinearity, self-injection locking and correlation in a
   microresonator
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB Production of entangled photon pairs is important in secure communication systems, quantum computing, and fundamental physics experiments. Achieving efficient generation of such photon pairs with low-loss parametric oscillators is a key objective in advancing integrated quantum technologies. However, spatially separating the generated photons while preserving their entanglement represents a significant technical challenge. In this work, we demonstrate nonlinear generation of correlated optical harmonics based on non-degenerate four-wave mixing with an optimally pumped optical microcavity with Kerr nonlinearity. The phase matching of the process is achieved with self-injection locked lasers producing parametric oscillation while locked to two different modes of the microresonator. This condition is reminiscent of slow-light technique developed for coherent atomic systems. The experimental design, utilizing counterpropagating light from two self-injection locked lasers, also effectively addresses the challenge of spatial separation of the generated harmonics. Additionally, we demonstrate correlation mediated by self injection locking and Kerr nonlinearity between the two lasers. We validate the theoretical predictions using two self-injection locked semiconductor lasers integrated with a crystalline whispering gallery mode resonator with optimized spectral structure.

TI Topological protection versus degree of entanglement of two-photon light
   in photonic topological insulators
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Topological insulators combine insulating properties in the bulk with scattering-free transport along edges, supporting dissipationless unidirectional energy and information flow even in the presence of defects and disorder. The feasibility of engineering quantum Hamiltonians with photonic tools, combined with the availability of entangled photons, raises the intriguing possibility of employing topologically protected entangled states in optical quantum computing and information processing. However, while two-photon states built as a product of two topologically protected single-photon states inherit full protection from their single-photon "parents", a high degree of non-separability may lead to rapid deterioration of the two-photon states after propagation through disorder. In this work, we identify physical mechanisms which contribute to the vulnerability of entangled states in topological photonic lattices. Further, we show that in order to maximize entanglement without sacrificing topological protection, the joint spectral correlation map of two-photon states must fit inside a well-defined topological window of protection. Topological protection of entangled states is a promising avenue for photonic quantum technologies. Here, Tschernig et al. theoretically analyse the impact of disorder on topological protection of entangled two-photon states in periodic and aperiodic topological insulator lattices.

TI Full monitoring of ensemble trajectories with 10 dB-sub-Heisenberg
   imprecision
SO NPJ QUANTUM INFORMATION
AB The change of a quantum state can generally only be fully monitored through simultaneous measurements of two non-commuting observables (X) over cap and (Y) over cap spanning a phase space. A measurement device that is coupled to the thermal environment provides at a time a pair of values that have a minimal uncertainty product set by the Heisenberg uncertainty relation, which limits the precision of the monitoring. Here, we report on an optical ensemble measurement setup that is able to monitor the time-dependent change of the quantum state's displacement in phase space ((X) over cap (t); (Y) over cap (t)) with an imprecision 10 dB below the Heisenberg uncertainty limit. Our setup provides pairs of values (X(t(i)); Y(t(i))) from simultaneous measurements at subsequent times t(i). The measurement references are not coupled to the thermal environment but are established by an entangled quantum state. Our achievement of a tenfold reduced quantum imprecision in monitoring arbitrary time-dependent displacements supports the potential of the quantum technology required for entanglement-enhanced metrology and sensing as well as measurement-based quantum computing.

TI Instantaneous phase synchronization of two decoupled quantum limit-cycle
   oscillators induced by conditional photon detection
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB We show that conditional photon detection induces instantaneous phase synchronization between two decoupled quantum limit-cycle oscillators. We consider two quantum van der Pol oscillators without mutual coupling, each with additional single-photon dissipation, and perform continuous measurement of photon counting on the output fields of the two baths interacting through a beam splitter. It is observed that in-phase or antiphase coherence of the two decoupled oscillators instantaneously increases after photon detection and then decreases gradually in the weak quantum regime or quickly in the strong quantum regime until the next photon detection occurs. In the strong quantum regime, quantum entanglement also increases after photon detection and quickly disappears. We derive the analytical upper bounds for the increases in the quantum entanglement and phase coherence by conditional photon detection in the quantum limit.

AB The decay of Higgs boson into two spin-1/2 particles provides an ideal system to reveal quantum entanglement and Bell-nonlocality. Future e(+)e(-) colliders can improve the measurement accuracy of the spin correlation of tau lepton pairs from Higgs boson decay. We show the testability of Bell inequality through h ->tau tau at Circular Electron Positron Collider (CEPC). Two realistic methods of testing Bell inequality are investigated, i.e., Tornqvist's method and Clauser-Home-Shimony-Holt (CHSH) inequality. In the simulation, we consider the detector effects of CEPC including uncertainties for tracks and jets from Z boson in the production of e(+)e(-)-> Zh. Necessary reconstruction approaches are described to measure quantum entanglement between tau(+) and tau(-). Finally, we show the sensitivity of CEPC to Bell inequality violation for the two methods.

TI Electrically and Geometrically Tunable Photon Pair Entanglement from
   Ferroelectric Nematic Liquid Crystal
SO ADVANCED SCIENCE
AB Entangled photons are a cornerstone of quantum technologies, enabling applications from secure communication to quantum computing. A longstanding challenge is to develop a compact source that would generate polarization-entangled photons with tunable quantum state on demand. The promising materials for such sources are ferroelectric nematic liquid crystals (FNLCs), due to their nonlinear optical properties and easily controllable configuration. In this work, it is demonstrated that the polarization state and the degree of entanglement of photon pairs generated within FNLCs can be changed in a controllable and reversible manner. First, tuning of the entanglement is demonstrated via sample geometry with twisted FNLC configurations in a sample of varying thickness. Secondly, by applying an electric field, the degree of entanglement can be tuned in real time. In both scenarios, the degree of entanglement can be adjusted from nearly entirely separate photons to fully entangled. These findings represent a significant step toward tunable quantum sources that can produce any desired polarization state on demand. In the future, by adding more electrodes, different parts of the sample could be controlled individually, allowing for the creation of pixelated quantum light sources.

TI Ultrasensitive single-ion electrometry in a magnetic field gradient
SO NATURE PHYSICS
AB Hyperfine energy levels in trapped ions offer long-lived spin states. In addition, the motion of these charged particles couples strongly to electric field perturbations. These characteristics make trapped ions attractive platforms for the quantum sensing of electric fields. However, the spin states do not exhibit a strong intrinsic coupling to electric fields, lim iting the achievable sensitivity. Here, we amplify the coupling between electric field perturbations and the spin states by using a static magnetic field gradient. Displacements of the trapped ion resulting from the applied electric field perturbations are thereby mapped to an instantaneous change in the energy-level splitting of the internal spin states. This gradient-mediated coupling of the electric field to the spin enables the use of well-established magnetometry protocols for electrometry, making it possible to achieve extremely sensitive measurements of d.c. and a.c. electric fields. We also employ a rotating-frame relaxometry technique and demonstrate the use of our quantum sensor as an electric field noise spectrum analyser. Finally, we describe a set of hardware modifications that are capable of achieving a further improvement in sensitivity by up to six orders of magnitude.

TI Modeling and Verification of Aircraft Takeoff Through Novel Quantum Nets
SO CMC-COMPUTERS MATERIALS & CONTINUA
AB The formal modeling and verification of aircraft takeoff is a challenge because it is a complex safety-critical operation. The task of aircraft takeoff is distributed amongst various computer-based controllers, however, with the growing malicious threats a secure communication between aircraft and controllers becomes highly important. This research serves as a starting point for integration of BB84 quantum protocol with petri nets for secure modeling and verification of takeoff procedure. The integrated model combines the BB84 quantum cryptographic protocol with powerful verification tool support offered by petri nets. To model certain important properties of BB84, a new variant of petri nets coined as Quantum Nets are proposed by defining their mathematical foundations and overall system dynamics, furthermore, some important system properties are also abstractly defined. The proposed Quantum Nets are then applied for modeling of aircraft takeoff process by defining three quantum nets: namely aircraft, runway controller and gate controller. For authentication between quantum nets, the use of external places and transitions is demonstrated to describe the encryption decryption process of qubits stream. Finally, the developed takeoff quantum network is verified through simulation offered by colored petri-net (CPN) Tools. Moreover, reachability tree (RT) analysis is also performed to have greater confidence in feasibility and correctness of the proposed aircraft takeoff model through the Quantum Nets.

TI Solutions of Modular Bootstrap Constraints from Quantum Codes
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB Modular invariance imposes rigid constraints on the partition functions of two-dimensional conformal field theories (CFTs). Many fundamental results follow strictly from modular invariance and unitarity, giving rise to the numerical modular bootstrap program. Here we report on a way to relate a particular family of quantum error correcting codes to a family of "code CFI's," which forms a subset of the space of Narain CFTs. This correspondence reduces modular invariance of the 2D CFT partition function to a few simple algebraic relations obeyed by a multivariate polynomial characterizing the corresponding code. Using this correspondence, we construct many explicit examples of physically distinct isospectral theories, as well as many examples of nonholomorphic functions, which satisfy all the basic properties of a 2D CFT partition function, yet are not associated with any known CFT.

TI Bridging Magic and Non-Gaussian Resources via Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill
   Encoding
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB Although the similarity between nonstabilizer states-also known as magic states-in discrete-variable systems and non-Gaussian states in continuous-variable systems has widely been recognized, the precise connections between these two notions have still been unclear. We establish a fundamental link between these two quantum resources via the Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill (GKP) encoding. We show that the negativity of the continuous-variable Wigner function for an encoded GKP state coincides with a magic measure we introduce, which matches the negativity of the discrete Wigner function for odd dimensions. We also provide a continuous-variable representation of the stabilizer R & eacute;nyi entropy-a recent proposal for a magic measure for multiqubit states. We further provide the magic measure with an operational interpretation as a runtime of a classical simulation algorithm. In addition, we employ our results to prove that implementing a multiqubit logical non-Clifford operation in the GKP code subspace requires a non- Gaussian operation even at the limit of perfect encoding, despite the fact that the ideal GKP states already come with a large amount of non-Gaussianity.

TI Pushing the boundary of quantum advantage in hard combinatorial
   optimization with probabilistic computers
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Recent demonstrations on specialized benchmarks have reignited excitement for quantum computers, yet their advantage for real-world problems remains an open question. Here, we show that probabilistic computers, co-designed with hardware to implement Monte Carlo algorithms, provide a scalable classical pathway for solving hard optimization problems. We focus on two algorithms applied to three-dimensional spin glasses: discrete-time simulated quantum annealing and adaptive parallel tempering. We benchmark these methods against a leading quantum annealer. For simulated quantum annealing, increasing replicas improves residual energy scaling, consistent with extreme value theory. Adaptive parallel tempering, supported by non-local isoenergetic cluster moves, scales more favorably and outperforms simulated quantum annealing. Field Programmable Gate Arrays or specialized chips can implement these algorithms in modern hardware, leveraging massive parallelism to accelerate them while improving energy efficiency. Our results establish a rigorous classical baseline for assessing practical quantum advantage and present probabilistic computers as a scalable platform for real-world optimization challenges.

TI Protocol Discovery for the Quantum Control of Majoranas by
   Differentiable Programming and Natural Evolution Strategies
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB Quantum control, which refers to the active manipulation of physical systems described by the laws of quantum mechanics, constitutes an essential ingredient for the development of quantum technology. Here we apply differentiable programming (DP) and natural evolution strategies (NES) to the optimal transport of Majorana zero modes in superconducting nanowires, a key element to the success of Majorana-based topological quantum computation. We formulate the motion control of Majorana zero modes as an optimization problem for which we propose a new categorization of four different regimes with respect to the critical velocity of the system and the total transport time. In addition to correctly recovering the anticipated smooth protocols in the adiabatic regime, our algorithms uncover efficient but strikingly counterintuitive motion strategies in the nonadiabatic regime. The emergent picture reveals a simple but high-fidelity strategy that makes use of pulselike jumps at the beginning and the end of the protocol with a period of constant velocity in between the jumps, which we dub the jump-move-jump protocol. We provide a transparent semianalytical picture, which uses the sudden approximation and a reformulation of the Majorana motion in a moving frame, to illuminate the key characteristics of the jump-move-jump control strategy. We verify that the jump-move-jump protocol remains robust against the presence of interactions or disorder, and corroborate its high efficacy on a realistic proximity-coupled nanowire model. Our results demonstrate that machine learning for quantum control can be applied efficiently to quantum many-body dynamical systems with performance levels that make it relevant to the realization of large-scale quantum technology.

TI l-LCP of codes and their applications to EAQEC codes
SO QUANTUM INFORMATION PROCESSING
AB In this paper, we first generalize the complementary pair of codes over finite fields to an l-linear complementary pair (l-LCP) of codes. Then two criteria of l-LCP of codes over finite fields are obtained. We especially investigate l-LCP of constacyclic codes. When C and D are all ?-constacyclic codes, we obtain a characterization of (C, D) to be l-LCP of codes. When C and D are cyclic and negacyclic codes, we give a sufficient condition of (C, D) to be l-LCP of codes. As an application, by means of the l-LCP of codes over finite fields, we exhibit two methods of constructing entanglement assisted quantum error correcting (EAQEC) codes. Notably, the parameters of our EAQEC codes are new and flexible.

TI Entangling spin and charge degrees of freedom in semiconductor quantum
   dots
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB In this theoretical manuscript I propose a scheme for entangling a single-electron-semiconductor spin qubit with a single-electron-semiconductor charge qubit in a triangular triple-quantum-dot configuration. Two out of three quantum dots are used to define a single-electron-semiconductor charge qubit. Furthermore, the spin qubit is embedded in the Zeeman sublevels of the third quantum dot. Combining single-qubit gates with entangling controlled-NOT gates allows one to construct a SWAP gate and therefore to use the semiconductor spin qubit as a long-lived memory for the semiconductor charge qubit.

TI Phase manipulated two-mode entangled state from a phase-sensitive
   amplifier
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB The phase manipulation of the two-mode entangled state, which can flexibly control the combination of quadrature components on demand, is important for continuous variable (CV) quantum information and quantum metrology. Here, we experimentally demonstrate the phase manipulation of entangled state by using a phase-sensitive amplifier (PSA) based on four-wave mixing (FWM) process. The entanglement with different phase space squeezing orientations can be generated by directly changing the phase of the PSA. Our scheme is concise and can be expanded to generate multi-parties entangled states on demand. Our results here pave the way to realize a phase-coded quantum key distribution protocol and squeezing-enhanced Raman spectroscopy.

TI Shortcuts to adiabaticity for open systems in circuit quantum
   electrodynamics
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Shortcuts to adiabaticity are powerful quantum control methods, allowing quick evolution into target states of otherwise slow adiabatic dynamics. Such methods have widespread applications in quantum technologies, and various shortcuts to adiabaticity protocols have been demonstrated in closed systems. However, realizing shortcuts to adiabaticity for open quantum systems has presented a challenge due to the complex controls in existing proposals. Here, we present the experimental demonstration of shortcuts to adiabaticity for open quantum systems, using a superconducting circuit quantum electrodynamics system. By applying a counterdiabatic driving pulse, we reduce the adiabatic evolution time of a single lossy mode from 800 ns to 100 ns. In addition, we propose and implement an optimal control protocol to achieve fast and qubit-unconditional equilibrium of multiple lossy modes. Our results pave the way for precise time-domain control of open quantum systems and have potential applications in designing fast open-system protocols of physical and interdisciplinary interest, such as accelerating bioengineering and chemical reaction dynamics.

What are the expectations regarding the future relevance of second-generation quantum technologies? What are the requirements for the workforce in the coming quantum industry? Which competences, knowledge, and skills should future employees have? In this paper, we report the results of our study that were aimed at mapping requirements and forecasts for the future quantum workforce. Our study consisted of three consecutive survey rounds. In total, we gathered 188 responses from industry and academic experts across Europe. Our study results served as an input for the development of the European Competence Framework for Quantum Technologies, delivered by the project QTEdu CSA for the European Quantum Flagship. In addition, we will discuss predictions from experts related to the future quantum workforce, including the expected industrial relevance of the main areas of quantum technologies, the need for educational efforts, and the expected influence of quantum technologies on everyday life.

TI Experimental revival of an unknown state from the past in quantum walks
SO NATIONAL SCIENCE REVIEW
AB The physical process in the macroscopic world unfolds along a single time direction, while the evolution of a quantum system is reversible in principle. How to recover a quantum system to its past state is a complex issue of both fundamental and practical interests. In this article, we experimentally demonstrate a novel method for recovering the state in quantum walks (QWs), also known as full-state revival. Moreover, we observe two other important phenomena in QWs, recurrence and periodicity, via simplifying and repeatedly implementing the scheme, respectively. Our experiments show that obtaining these phenomena requires neither any information of the initial state nor full information of the coin operations. Our work sheds new light on quantum state engineering and recovery, and the initialization of quantum devices based on QWs.
   A photonic walker is restored to its past state without requiring any information about the initial state or full details of the coin operations.

TI Physical synthesis in distributed quantum architectures
SO PHYSICA SCRIPTA
AB The inherent power of quantum computing in parallelizing computations makes it possible to solve some specific problems in a much shorter time than classical computing. Considering the physical issues governing this type of computing, one of the approaches to increase the scalability of such systems is using distributed quantum architectures. A quantum algorithm requires a quantum circuit for a successful implementation. The quantum circuit design flow comprises two main parts: logical synthesis and physical design. Physical synthesis is one of the main steps of the physical design. It improves circuit metrics such as latency and area by changing the netlist or the layout using the information obtained from the initial layout and scheduling. In this paper, we have presented a new physical synthesis method to reduce the quantum circuit delay in distributed architectures. It moves some gates from one partition to another to reduce the number of teleportation operations on the critical path using the scheduled layout information. The experimental results show that this method improves the delay of benchmark circuits on average by 33.40%.

TI Observation of triplet superconductivity in

SO SCIENCE ADVANCES
AB Unconventional superconductivity and, in particular, triplet superconductivity have been front and center of topological materials and quantum technology research. Here, we report our observation of triplet pairing in nonmagnetic CoSi2/TiSi2 heterostructures on silicon. CoSi2 undergoes a sharp superconducting transition at a critical temperature T-c similar or equal to 1.5 K, while TiSi2 is a normal metal. We investigate conductance spectra of both two-terminal CoSi2/TiSi2 contact junctions and three-terminal T-shaped CoSi2/TiSi2 superconducting proximity structures. Below T-c, we observe (i) a narrow zero-bias conductance peak on top of a broad hump, accompanied by two symmetric side dips in the contact junctions, (ii) a narrow zero-bias conductance peak in T-shaped structures, and (iii) hysteresis in the junction magnetoresistance. These three independent and complementary observations point to chiral p-wave pairing in CoSi2/TiSi2 heterostructures. The excellent fabrication compatibility of CoSi2 and TiSi2 with present-day silicon-based integrated-circuit technology suggests their potential use in scalable quantum-computing devices.

TI PUF-Based Post-Quantum CAN-FD Framework for Vehicular Security
SO INFORMATION
AB The Controller Area Network (CAN) is a bus protocol widely used in Electronic control Units (ECUs) to communicate between various subsystems in vehicles. Insecure CAN networks can allow attackers to control information between vital vehicular subsystems. As vehicles can have lifespans of multiple decades, post-quantum cryptosystems are essential for protecting the vehicle communication systems from quantum attacks. However, standard CAN's efficiency and payload sizes are too small for post-quantum cryptography. The Controller Area Network Flexible Data-Rate (CAN-FD) is an updated protocol for CAN that increases transmission speeds and maximum payload size. With CAN-FD, higher security standards, such as post-quantum, can be utilized without severely impacting performance. In this paper, we propose PUF-Based Post-Quantum Cryptographic CAN-FD Framework, or PUF-PQC-CANFD. Our framework provides post-quantum security to the CAN network while transmitting and storing less information than other existing pre-quantum and post-quantum CAN frameworks. Our proposal protects against most cryptographic-based attacks while transmitting (at up to 100 ECUs) 25-94% less messages than existing pre-quantum frameworks and 99% less messages than existing post-quantum frameworks. PUF-PQC-CANFD is optimized for smaller post-quantum key sizes, storage requirements, and transmitted information to minimize the impact on resource-restricted ECUs.

AB Quantum annealers (QA), such as D-Wave systems, become increasingly efficient and competitive at approximating combinatorial optimization problems. However, solving problems that do not directly map the chip topology remains challenging for this type of quantum computer. The creation of logical qubits as sets of interconnected physical qubits overcomes limitations imposed by the sparsity of the chip at the expense of increasing the problem size and adding new parameters to optimize. This paper explores the advantages and drawbacks provided by the structure of the logical qubits and the impact of the rescaling of coupler strengths on the minimum spectral gap of Ising models. We show that logical qubits encoded over densely connected physical qubits require a lower chain strength to maintain the ferromagnetic coupling. We also analyze the optimal chain strength variations considering different minor embeddings of the same instance. This experimental study suggests that the chain strength can be optimized for each instance. We design a heuristic that optimizes the chain strength using a very low number of shots during the preprocessing step. This heuristic outperforms the default method used to initialize the chain strength on D-Wave systems, increasing the quality of the best solution by up to 17.2% for tested instances on the max-cut problem.

TI Dynamical emission of phonon pairs in optomechanical systems
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB The multiphonon state plays an important role in quantum information processing and quantum metrology. Here we propose a scheme to realize dynamical emission of phonon pairs based on the technique of stimulated Raman adiabatic passage in a single-cavity optomechanical system, where the optical cavity is driven by two Gaussian pulse lasers. By exploring quantum trajectories of the state populations and the average phonon number, we find that the dynamical phonon-pair emission can be realized under the appropriate parameter conditions and is tunable by controlling the time interval between the consecutive pulses of pump lasers. In particular, the numerical results for the standard and generalized second-order correlation functions of the mechanical mode show that the system can behave as an antibunched phonon-pair emitter. Our proposal can be extended to achieve an antibunched n-phonon emitter, which has potential applications for on-chip quantum communication.

SO NANO LETTERS
AB Quantum physics phenomena,entanglement and coherence,are crucialfor quantum information protocols, but understanding these in systemswith more than two parts is challenging due to increasing complexity.The W state, a multipartite entangled state, is notable for its robustnessand benefits in quantum communication. Here, we generate eight-modeon-demand single-photon W states, using nanowire quantum dots anda silicon nitride photonic chip. We demonstrate a reliable and scalabletechnique for reconstructing the W state in photonic circuits usingFourier and real-space imaging, supported by the Gerchberg-Saxtonphase retrieval algorithm. Additionally, we utilize an entanglementwitness to distinguish between mixed and entangled states, therebyaffirming the entangled nature of our generated state. The study providesa new imaging approach of assessing multipartite entanglement in Wstates, paving the way for further progress in image processing andFourier-space analysis techniques for complex quantum systems.

TI Hydrodynamics of quantum entropies in Ising chains with linear
   dissipation
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICS A-MATHEMATICAL AND THEORETICAL
AB We study the dynamics of quantum information and of quantum correlations after a quantum quench, in transverse field Ising chains subject to generic linear dissipation. As we show, in the hydrodynamic limit of long times, large system sizes, and weak dissipation, entropy-related quantities-such as the von Neumann entropy, the Renyi entropies, and the associated mutual information-admit a simple description within the so-called quasiparticle picture. Specifically, we analytically derive a hydrodynamic formula, recently conjectured for generic noninteracting systems, which allows us to demonstrate a universal feature of the dynamics of correlations in such dissipative noninteracting system. For any possible dissipation, the mutual information grows up to a time scale that is proportional to the inverse dissipation rate, and then decreases, always vanishing in the long time limit. In passing, we provide analytic formulas describing the time-dependence of arbitrary functions of the fermionic covariance matrix, in the hydrodynamic limit.

TI Approximate maximum-likelihood decoding with K minimum weight
   matchings
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Minimum weight matching (MWM) and maximum likelihood decoding (MLD) are two widely used and distinct decoding strategies for quantum error correction. For a given syndrome, the MWM decoder finds the most probable physical error corresponding to the MWM of the decoding graph, whereas MLD aims to find the most probable logical error. Although MLD is the optimal error correction strategy, it is typically more computationally expensive compared to the MWM decoder. In this work, we introduce an algorithm that approximates MLD with K MWMs from the decoding graph. Taking the surface code subject to graphlike errors as an example, we show that it is possible to efficiently find the first K MWMs by systematically modifying the original decoding graph followed by finding the MWMs of the modified graphs. For the case where the X and Z errors are correlated, despite the fact that the MWM of the decoding hypergraph cannot be found efficiently, we present a heuristic approach to approximate the MLD by finding the K MWMs in the X and Z subgraphs. We benchmark the efficacy of our algorithm for the surface code subject to graphlike errors as well as the surface-square Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill (GKP) code and surface-hexagonal GKP code subject to the Gaussian random displacement errors, showing that the fidelity approaches that of the exact MLD (for the first two cases) or the tensor-network decoder (for the last case) as K increases.

TI The cost of quantum locality
SO PROCEEDINGS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY A-MATHEMATICAL PHYSICAL AND ENGINEERING
   SCIENCES
AB It has been more than 20 years since Deutsch and Hayden demonstrated that quantum systems can be completely described locally-notwithstanding Bell's theorem. More recently, Raymond-Robichaud proposed two other approaches to the same conclusion. In this paper, all these means of describing quantum systems locally are proved formally equivalent. The cost of such descriptions is then quantified by the dimensionality of their underlining space. The number of degrees of freedom of a single qubit's local description is shown to grow exponentially with the total number of qubits considered as a global system. This apparently unreasonable cost to describe such a small system in a large Universe is nonetheless shown to be expected. Finally, structures that supplement the universal wave function are investigated.

TI Application-level benchmarking of quantum computers using nonlocal game
   strategies
SO QUANTUM SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB In a nonlocal game, two noncommunicating players cooperate to convince a referee that they possess a strategy that does not violate the rules of the game. Quantum strategies allow players to optimally win some games by performing joint measurements on a shared entangled state, but computing these strategies can be challenging. We present a variational quantum algorithm to compute quantum strategies for nonlocal games by encoding the rules of a nonlocal game into a Hamiltonian. We show how this algorithm can generate a short-depth optimal quantum strategy for a graph coloring game with a quantum advantage. This quantum strategy is then evaluated on fourteen different quantum hardware platforms to demonstrate its utility as a benchmark. Finally, we discuss potential sources of errors that can explain the observed decreased performance of the executed task and derive an expression for the number of samples required to accurately estimate the win rate in the presence of noise.

TI Multi-functional photonic processors using coherent network of
   micro-ring resonators
SO APL PHOTONICS
AB Silicon photonics have widespread applications in optical communications, photonic sensors, and quantum information processing systems. Different photonic integrated circuits often require similar basic functional elements such as tunable filters, optical switches, wavelength de-multiplexers, optical delay lines, and polarization crosstalk unscrambling. Other optical signal processing functional elements may be needed in specific applications, for example, the differentiation with respect to time of time-varying optical signals and the implementation of very high extinction interferometers in some integrated quantum photonic circuits. Just as reconfigurable electronic processors in microelectronics have advantages in terms of ready availability and low cost from large-volume generic manufacturing and are useful for configuration into different functionalities in the form of field-programmable gate arrays, here, we show how an integrated coherent network of micro-ring resonators can be used in reconfigurable photonic processors. We demonstrate the implementation of optical filters, optical delay lines, optical space switching fabric, high extinction ratio Mach-Zehnder interferometer, and photonic differentiation in a reconfigurable network where the control of the phase in the different arms of the coherent network can determine the implemented functionality.

Three-dimensional (3D) MOFs are a versatile platform for the rational design of extended structures employing coordination chemistry. Here, we report the synthesis and characterization of a gadolinium(III)-based MOF, [Gd(bipyNO)(4)](TfO)(3)center dot xMeOH (bipyNO = bipyridine,N,N'-dioxide; TfO = triflate; and MeOH = methanol) (quMOF-1), which presents a unique coordination geometry that leads to a tiny magnetic anisotropy (in terms of D, an equivalent zero-field splitting would be achieved by D = 0.006 cm(-1)) even compared with regular Gd(III) complexes. Pulsed electron paramagnetic resonance experiments on its magnetically diluted samples confirm the preservation of quantum coherence of single Gd(III) qubit units in this 3D extended molecular architecture (T-2 = 612 ns and T-1 = 66 mu s at 3.5 K), which allows for the detection of Rabi oscillations at 40 K.

TI Efficient strategies for reducing sampling error in quantum Krylov
   subspace diagonalization
SO DIGITAL DISCOVERY
AB Within the realm of early fault-tolerant quantum computing (EFTQC), quantum Krylov subspace diagonalization (QKSD) has emerged as a promising quantum algorithm for the approximate Hamiltonian diagonalization via projection onto the quantum Krylov subspace. However, the algorithm often requires solving an ill-conditioned generalized eigenvalue problem (GEVP) involving erroneous matrix pairs, which can significantly distort the solution. Since EFTQC assumes limited-scale error correction, finite sampling error becomes a dominant source of error in these matrices. This work focuses on quantifying sampling errors during the measurement of matrix element in the projected Hamiltonian examining two measurement approaches based on the Hamiltonian decompositions: the linear combination of unitaries and diagonalizable fragments. To reduce sampling error within a fixed budget of quantum circuit repetitions, we propose two measurement strategies: the shifting technique and coefficient splitting. The shifting technique eliminates redundant Hamiltonian components that annihilate either the bra or ket states, while coefficient splitting optimizes the measurement of common terms across different circuits. Numerical experiments with electronic structures of small molecules demonstrate the effectiveness of these strategies, reducing sampling costs by a factor of 20-500.

TI Quantum Byzantine Agreement for Any Number of Dishonest Parties
SO QUANTUM INFORMATION PROCESSING
AB Reaching agreement in the presence of arbitrary faults is a fundamental problem in distributed computation, which has been shown to be unsolvable if one-third of the processes can fail, unless signed messages are used. In this paper, we propose a solution to a variation of the original BA problem, called Detectable Byzantine Agreement (DBA), that does not need to use signed messages. The proposed algorithm uses what we call Q-correlated lists, which are generated by a quantum source device. Once each process has one of these lists, they use them to reach the agreement in a classical manner. Although, in general, the agreement is reached by using in + 1 rounds (where in is the number of processes that can fail), if less than one-third of the processes fail it only needs one round to reach the agreement.

TI Inverse-coefficient black-box quantum state preparation
SO NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB Black-box quantum state preparation is a fundamental building block for many higher-level quantum algorithms. The basic task of black-box state preparation is to transduce the data encoded as computational basis of quantum state into the amplitude. In the present work, we address the problem of transducing the reciprocal of the data, not the data itself into the amplitude, which is called the inverse-coefficient problem. This algorithm can be used directly as a subroutine in the matrix inversion algorithms. Furthermore, we extend this approach to address the more general nonlinear-coefficient problem in black-box state preparation. Our algorithm is based on the technique of inequality test. It can greatly relieve the need to do quantum arithmetic and the error is only resulted from the truncated error of binary string. The present algorithms enrich the algorithm library of black-box quantum state preparation and will be useful ingredients of quantum algorithm to implement non-linear quantum state transformations.

The resultant four [4]rotaxanes were characterized by single crystal X-ray diffraction and electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy. Orientation-selective 4-pulse double electron-electron resonance (DEER) measurements between the three {Cr7Ni} rings incorporated in each [4]rotaxane reveal that each system is conformationally fluxional in solution, with the most abundant conformations found to differ significantly from the crystal structure geometry for each compound. The degree of similarity between conformations is evaluated using a novel application of the earth mover's distance analysis.

TI Millisecond-Lived Circular Rydberg Atoms in a Room-Temperature
   Experiment
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB Circular Rydberg states are excellent tools for quantum technologies, with large mutual interactions and long lifetimes in the tens of milliseconds range, 2 orders of magnitude larger than those of laser-accessible Rydberg states. However, such lifetimes are observed only at zero temperature. At room temperature, blackbody-radiation-induced transfers cancel this essential asset of circular states, which have thus been used mostly so far in specific, complex cryogenic experiments. We demonstrate here, on a laser-cooled atomic sample, a circular state lifetime of more than 1 millisecond at room temperature for a principal quantum number 60. A simple plane-parallel capacitor efficiently inhibits the blackbody-radiation-induced transfers. One of the capacitor electrodes is fully transparent and provides large optical access to the atoms. This result paves the way to a wide range of quantum metrology and quantum simulation room-temperature experiments with long-lived, trapped circular Rydberg atoms in inhibition capacitors with full optical access.

We show that either (a) the algorithm finds the optimal solution in time O* (2((0.5-c)n)) for an n-independent constant c, a 2(cn) advantage over Grover's algorithm; or (b) there are sufficiently many low-cost solutions such that classical random guessing produces a (1 - eta) approximation to the optimal cost value in sub-exponential time for arbitrarily small choice of eta. Additionally, we show that for a large fraction of random instances from the k-spin model and for any fully satisfiable or slightly frustrated k-CSP formula, statement (a) is the case. The algorithm and its analysis are largely inspired by Hastings' short-path algorithm.

TI Quantum Simulation of the Silicene and Germanene for Sensing and
   Sequencing of DNA/RNA Nucleobases
SO BIOSENSORS-BASEL
AB Over the last decade, we have been witnessing the rise of two-dimensional (2D) materials. Several 2D materials with outstanding properties have been theoretically predicted and experimentally synthesized. 2D materials are good candidates for sensing and detecting various biomolecules because of their extraordinary properties, such as a high surface-to-volume ratio. Silicene and germanene are the monolayer honeycomb structures of silicon and germanium, respectively. Quantum simulations have been very effective in understanding the interaction mechanism of 2D materials and biomolecules and may play an important role in the development of effective and reliable biosensors. This article focuses on understanding the interaction of DNA/RNA nucleobases with silicene and germanane monolayers and obtaining the possibility of using silicene and germanane monolayers as a biosensor for DNA/RNA nucleobases' sequencing using the first principle of Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations with van der Waals (vdW) correction and nonequilibrium Green's function method. Guanine (G), Cytosine (C), Adenine (A), Thymine (T), and Uracil (U) were examined as the analytes. The strength of adsorption between the DNA/RNA nucleobases and silicene and germanane is G > C > A > T > U. Moreover, our recent work on the investigation of Au- and Li-decorated silicene and germanane for detection of DNA/RNA nucleobases is presented. Our results show that it is possible to get remarkable changes in transmittance due to the adsorption of nucleobases, especially for G, A, and C. These results indicate that silicene and germanene are both good candidates for the applications in fast sequencing devices for DNA/RNA nucleobases. Additionally, our present results have the potential to give insight into experimental studies and can be valuable for advancements in biosensing and nanobiotechnology.

TI Strong-coupling diagnostics for multimode open systems
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Engineered quantum systems play a central role in quantum information processing. Typically, these systems are strongly coupled to their environments, which presents challenges and opportunities to harness controllable quantum effects in such systems. One of the outstanding challenges is to characterize the quantum correlations that develop in such out-of-equilibrium quantum systems. Here we present a method that utilizes low-dimensional projections of eigenvectors to distinguish different types of correlations in an N-mode open system. The proposed method presents a nontrivial extension of eigenvalue-based analysis employed for such systems; specifically, it not only diagnoses crossovers between weak and strong coupling regimes (also known as "exceptional points") but also can identify the physical systems of interest spanning the correlated subspaces in different regions of the multimode strong-coupling regime. As a demonstration of this feature, we apply our method to study hybridization physics in a three-mode optomechanical system and determine the parameter regime for efficient sideband cooling of the system in the presence of reservoir correlations.

TI State-agnostic approach to certifying electron-photon entanglement in
   electron microscopy
SO QUANTUM SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB Transmission electron microscopes (TEMs) enable atomic-scale imaging and characterisation, driving advances across fields from materials science to biology. Quantum correlations, specifically entanglement, may provide a basis for novel hybrid sensing techniques to make TEMs compatible with sensitive samples prone to radiation damage. We present a protocol to certify entanglement between electrons and photons naturally arising from certain coherent cathodoluminescence processes. Using mutually unbiased bases in position and momentum, our method allows robust, state-agnostic entanglement verification and provides a lower bound on the entanglement of formation, enabling quantitative comparisons across platforms. Simulations under experiment-inspired conditions and preliminary experimental data highlight the feasibility of implementing this approach in modern TEM systems with optical specimen access. Our work integrates photonic quantum information techniques with electron microscopy. It establishes a foundation for entanglement-based imaging at the atomic scale, offering a potential pathway to reduce radiation exposure.

TI Unification of random dynamical decoupling and the quantum Zeno effect
SO NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB Periodic deterministic bang-bang dynamical decoupling and the quantum Zeno effect are known to emerge from the same physical mechanism. Both concepts are based on cycles of strong and frequent kicks provoking a subdivision of the Hilbert space into independent subspaces. However, previous unification results do not capture the case of random bang-bang dynamical decoupling, which can be advantageous to the deterministic case but has an inherently acyclic structure. Here, we establish a correspondence between random dynamical decoupling and the quantum Zeno effect by investigating the average over random decoupling evolutions. This protocol is a manifestation of the quantum Zeno dynamics and leads to a unitary bath evolution. By providing a framework that we call equitability of system and bath, we show that the system dynamics under random dynamical decoupling converges to a unitary with a decoupling error that characteristically depends on the convergence speed of the Zeno limit. This reveals a unification of the random dynamical decoupling and the quantum Zeno effect.

TI Grover search revisited: Application to image pattern matching
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB The landmark Grover algorithm for amplitude amplification serves as an essential subroutine in various types of quantum algorithms, with guaranteed quantum speedup in query complexity. However, there has been no proposal to realize the original motivating application of the algorithm, i.e., the database search or more broadly the pattern matching in a practical setting, mainly due to the technical difficulty in efficiently implementing the data loading and amplitude amplification processes. In this paper, we propose a quantum algorithm that approximately executes the entire Grover database search or pattern matching algorithm. The key idea is to use the recently proposed approximate amplitude encoding method on a shallow quantum circuit, together with the easily implementable inversion-test operation for realizing the projected quantum state having similarity to the query data, followed by the amplitude amplification operation that is independent to the target data index. We provide a thorough demonstration of the algorithm in the problem of image pattern matching.

TI Visualizing quantum phase transitions in the XXZ model via the
   quantum steering ellipsoid
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB The past two decades have witnessed a surge of interest in borrowing tools from quantum information theory to investigate quantum phase transitions (QPTs). The best-known examples are entanglement measures whose nonanalyticities at critical points were tied to QPTs in a plethora of physical models. Here, focusing on the XXZ model, we show how QPTs can be revealed through the quantum steering ellipsoid (QSE), which is a geometric tool capable of characterizing both the strength and type of quantum correlations between two subsystems of a compound system. We find that the QSE associated with the XXZ model changes in shape with the QPTs; that is, it is a needle in the ferromagnetic phase, an oblate spheroid in the gapless phase, and a prolate spheroid in the antiferromagnetic phase. This finding offers an example demonstrating the intriguing possibility of unveiling QPTs in a geometrically visible fashion. Some connections between our results and previous ones are discussed.

TI Memory effects displayed in the evolution of continuous variable system

AB We analyze non-Markovian memory effects displayed by the quantum Brownian motion modelled as a quantum harmonic oscillator coupled to a bath consisting of harmonic oscillators. In particular, the evolution of fidelity, relative entropy and quantum entanglement (measured by negativity) is considered for a family of Gaussian states (one and two mode squeezed vacuum and three mode basset-hound states). It is shown how to enhance detection of memory effects by adding an additional (ancillary) mode such that only a single mode (a system) is subjected to the evolution. It is observed that even a small amount of squeezing allows detection of non-Markovian memory effects.& COPY; 2023 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier B.V.

TI Efficient Tensor Network Simulation of IBM's Eagle Kicked Ising
   Experiment
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB We report an accurate and efficient classical simulation of a kicked Ising quantum system on the heavy hexagon lattice. A simulation of this system was recently performed on a 127-qubit quantum processor using noise-mitigation techniques to enhance accuracy [Y. Kim et al., Nature, 618, 500-5 (2023)]. Here we show that, by adopting a tensor network approach that reflects the geometry of the lattice and is approximately contracted using belief propagation, we can perform a classical simulation that is significantly more accurate and precise than the results obtained from the quantum processor and many other classical methods. We quantify the treelike correlations of the wave function in order to explain the accuracy of our belief propagation-based approach. We also show how our method allows us to perform simulations of the system to long times in the thermodynamic limit, corresponding to a quantum computer with an infinite number of qubits. Our tensor network approach has broader applications for simulating the dynamics of quantum systems with treelike correlations.

TI Quantum advantages in (n,d) bar right arrow 1 random access codes
SO NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB A random access code (RAC), corresponding to a communication primitive with various applications in quantum information theory, is an instance of a preparation-and-measurement scenario. In this work, we consider (n, d)-RACs constituting an n-length string, constructed from a d size set of letters, and send an encoding of the string in a single d-level physical system and present their quantum advantages. We first characterize optimal classical RACs and prove that a known classical strategy, called majority-encoding-identity-decoding, is optimal. We then construct a quantum protocol by exploiting only two incompatible measurements (the minimal requirement) and show the advantages beyond the classical one. We also discuss the generality of our results and whether quantum advantages are valid for all types of (n,d) bar right arrow 1 RACs.

TI Single-shot number-resolved detection of microwave photons with error
   mitigation
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Single-photon detectors are ubiquitous and integral components of photonic quantum cryptography, communication, and computation. Many applications, however, require not only detecting the presence of any photons, but distinguishing the number present with a single shot. Here, we implement a single-shot, high-fidelity photon number-resolving detector of up to 15 microwave photons in a cavity-qubit circuit QED platform. This detector functions by measuring a series of generalized parity operators, which make up the bits in the binary decomposition of the photon number. Our protocol consists of successive, independent measurements of each bit by entangling the ancilla with the cavity, then reading out and resetting the ancilla. Photon loss and ancilla readout errors can flip one or more bits, causing nontrivial errors in the outcome, but these errors have a traceable form, which can be captured in a simple hidden Markov model. Relying on the independence of each bit measurement, we mitigate biases in ensembles of measurements, showing good agreement with the predictions of the model. The mitigation improves the average total variation distance error of Fock states from 13.5%-1.1%. We also show that the mitigation is efficiently scalable to an M-mode system provided that the errors are independent and sufficiently small. Our work motivates the development of new algorithms that utilize single-shot, high-fidelity PNR detectors.

TI Laser-cut patterned, micrometer-thin diamond membranes with coherent
   color centers for open microcavities
SO MATERIALS FOR QUANTUM TECHNOLOGY
AB Micrometer-scale thin diamond devices are key components for various quantum sensing and networking experiments, including the integration of color centers into optical microcavities. In this work, we introduce a laser-cutting method for patterning microdevices from millimeter-sized diamond membranes. The method can be used to fabricate devices with micrometer thicknesses and edge lengths of typically 10-100 mu m. We compare this method with an established nanofabrication process based on electron-beam lithography, a two-step transfer pattern utilizing a silicon nitride hard mask material, and reactive ion etching. Microdevices fabricated using both methods are bonded to a cavity Bragg mirror and characterized using scanning cavity microscopy. We record two-dimensional cavity finesse maps over the devices, revealing insights about the variation in diamond thickness, surface quality, and strain. The scans demonstrate that devices fabricated by laser-cutting exhibit similar properties to devices obtained by the conventional method. Finally, we show that the devices host optically coherent Tin- and Nitrogen-Vacancy centers suitable for applications in quantum networking.

TI Deep reinforcement learning for universal quantum state preparation via

AB Accurate and efficient preparation of quantum state is a core issue in building a quantum computer. In this paper, we investigate how to prepare a certain single- or two-qubit target state from arbitrary initial states in semiconductor double quantum dots with only a few discrete control pulses by leveraging the deep reinforcement learning. Our method is based on the training of the network over numerous preparing tasks. The results show that once the network is well trained, it works for any initial states in the continuous Hilbert space. Thus repeated training for new preparation tasks is avoided. Our scheme outperforms the traditional optimization approaches based on gradient with both the higher efficiency and the preparation quality in discrete control space. Moreover, we find that the control trajectories designed by our scheme are robust against stochastic fluctuations within certain thresholds, such as the charge and nuclear noises.

TI Tunable Generation of Spatial Entanglement in Nonlinear Waveguide Arrays
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB Harnessing high-dimensional entangled states of light presents a frontier for advancing quantum information technologies, from fundamental tests of quantum mechanics to enhanced computation and communication protocols. In this context, the spatial degree of freedom stands out as particularly suited for on-chip integration. But while traditional demonstrations produce and manipulate path-entangled states sequentially with discrete optical elements, continuously coupled nonlinear waveguide systems offer a promising alternative where photons can be generated and interfere along the entire propagation length, unveiling novel capabilities within a reduced footprint. Here we exploit this concept to implement a compact and reconfigurable source of path-entangled photon pairs based on parametric down-conversion in semiconductor nonlinear waveguide arrays. We use a double-pump configuration to engineer the output quantum state and implement various types of spatial correlations, exploiting a quantum interference effect between the biphoton state generated in each pumped waveguide. This demonstration, at room temperature and telecom wavelength, illustrates the potential of continuously coupled systems as a promising alternative to discrete multicomponent quantum circuits for leveraging the high-dimensional spatial degree of freedom of photons.

TI Evolution of Entanglement Witness of Dicke State under Noise and Error
   Mitigation
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF THEORETICAL PHYSICS
AB The experimental verification of multipartite entangled states is essential for advancing quantum information processing. Entanglement witnesses (EWs) provide a widely used and experimentally accessible approach for detecting genuinely multipartite entangled states. In this work, we theoretically derive the entanglement witness for the four-qubit Dicke state and experimentally evaluate it on two distinct IBM 127-qubit Quantum Processing Units (QPUs), namely ibm_sherbrooke and ibm_brisbane. A negative expectation value of the witness operator serves as a sufficient condition for confirming genuine multipartite entanglement. We report the maximum (negative) values of the witness achieved on these QPUs as \documentclass[12pt]{minimal} \usepackage{amsmath} \usepackage{wasysym} \usepackage{amsfonts} \usepackage{amssymb} \usepackage{amsbsy} \usepackage{mathrsfs} \usepackage{upgreek} \setlength{\oddsidemargin}{-69pt} \begin{document}$$-0.178 \pm 0.009$$\end{document} and \documentclass[12pt]{minimal} \usepackage{amsmath} \usepackage{wasysym} \usepackage{amsfonts} \usepackage{amssymb} \usepackage{amsbsy} \usepackage{mathrsfs} \usepackage{upgreek} \setlength{\oddsidemargin}{-69pt} \begin{document}$$-0.169 \pm 0.002$$\end{document}, corresponding to two different state preparation protocols.

TI Low percolation density and charge noise with holes in germanium
SO MATERIALS FOR QUANTUM TECHNOLOGY
AB We engineer planar Ge/SiGe heterostructures for low disorder and quiet hole quantum dot operation by positioning the strained Ge channel 55 nm below the semiconductor/dielectric interface. In heterostructure field effect transistors, we measure a percolation density for two-dimensional hole transport of 2.1 x 10(10) cm-(2,) indicative of a very low disorder potential landscape experienced by holes in the buried Ge channel. These Ge heterostructures support quiet operation of hole quantum dots and we measure v an average charge noise level of (root S-E) over bar = 0.6 mu eV//root Hz at 1 Hz, with the lowest level below our detection limit root S-E = 0.2 mu eV/root Hz. These results establish planar Ge as a promising platform for scaled two-dimensional spin qubit arrays.

TI Solve single photon detector problems
SO QUANTUM
AB Single photon detector(SPD) problems arise in most quan-tum tasks, especially for measuring states going through high -lost channels. They are particularly prominent in quantum key distribution(QKD), which could be the most significant appli-cation in quantum information theory. In recent years, QKD distance has been improved dramatically but is still restricted because the bit error rate(QBER) caused by SPD dark counts will be out of control as the distance increases. If this problem can be solved, QKD can be implemented over arbitrarily long distances. However, previous solutions often result in imprac-tical requirements such as superconductors while they can only reduce the dark count rate to finite low levels. In this paper, we solve SPD problems with today's technologies only. Although it is the no-cloning theorem that prevents a state from being mea-sured multiple times to obtain a more reliable result, we propose a scheme circumventing the no-cloning theorem in certain tasks to allow a single state to be employed several times. The scheme demonstrates that imperfect detectors can provide nearly per-fect results, namely, the QBER caused by dark counts can be reduced to arbitrarily low while in the meantime, detective effi-ciency can be improved to arbitrarily high. Consequently, QKD distance is not limited by the imperfect SPD anymore and can be improved from hundreds of kilometers to thousands without high-technology detectors. Furthermore, similar schemes can be applied for reducing measurement errors or improving the per-formance of sources. Finally, it is worth noting that although the paper is mainly discussed in the context of QKD, our scheme is an independent scheme that could be employed in other proto-cols wherever SPD are employed.

TI Quantum control methods for robust entanglement of trapped ions
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICS B-ATOMIC MOLECULAR AND OPTICAL PHYSICS
AB A major obstacle in the way of practical quantum computing is achieving scalable and robust high-fidelity entangling gates. To this end, quantum control has become an essential tool, as it can make the entangling interaction resilient to sources of noise. Nevertheless, it may be difficult to identify an appropriate quantum control technique for a particular need given the breadth of work pertaining to robust entanglement. To this end, we attempt to consolidate the literature by providing a non-exhaustive summary and critical analysis. The quantum control methods are separated into two categories: schemes which extend the robustness to (i) spin or (ii) motional decoherence. We choose to focus on extensions of the sigma ( x ) circle times sigma ( x ) Molmer-Sorensen interaction using microwaves and a static magnetic field gradient. Nevertheless, some of the techniques discussed here can be relevant to other trapped ion architectures or physical qubit implementations. Finally, we experimentally realize a proof-of-concept interaction with simultaneous robustness to spin and motional decoherence by combining several quantum control methods presented in this manuscript.

TI Ultra-broadband spectral and polarisation entanglement using
   dispersion-engineered nanophotonic waveguides
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB In this paper, we propose exploiting dispersion-engineered nanophotonic waveguides in generating unprecedented ultra-broadband spectral and polarisation entanglement using spontaneous four-wave mixing parametric processes. We developed a simplified theoretical quantum framework to investigate and analyze these interactions under pulse source excitations. Using aluminum gallium arsenide and thin-film lithium niobate waveguides, we anticipate obtaining photon pairs with high-dimensional frequency entanglement, characterized by Schmidt numbers as large as 108, and covering the wavelength range 940-2730 nm (equivalent to a 210 THz bandwidth). Additionally, we show that Al0.3Ga0.7As waveguides with hybrid cladding can enable the generation of polarisation-entangled photon pairs with concurrence exceeding 0.93 across wavelengths from 1175 nm to 1750 nm, spanning almost across all the telecommunication bands with only approximately 27 nm window inevitable-degradation around the pump wavelength. We envisage that these introduced integrated on-chip sources will significantly advance quantum photonic technologies, enabling breakthroughs in multi-channel quantum networking and scalable quantum information systems.

TI Chiral optical transport of quantum dots with different diamagnetic
   behaviors in a waveguide
SO ACTA PHYSICA SINICA
AB In order to realize scalable and integrated quantum photonic networks, various functional devices are highly desired. Strip waveguides with unidirectional transmission function have a wide range of applications in devices such as single-photon diodes, transistors and deterministic quantum gate devices. In this work, the separation of circularly polarized light is achieved by exciting a quantum dot light source in a central region of a waveguide at a low temperature of 4.2 K by using a confocal microscope system. By applying a magnetic fieldwith Faraday configuration (along with the quantum dot growth direction), the spin-momentum locking effectin the waveguide is verified. Both forward shift and reverse shift of different values of output photon energy aredemonstrated to show the unidirectional transmission of the waveguide. The chiral transmission of quantum dot with anomalous diamagnetic behavior is achieved in experiment, leading to a wider range of wavelength tuning for chrial transmission in a single waveguide. This paper provides a basis for investigating the chiral quantum devices in a wide wavelength range and expands the applications of waveguides in the field of optical quantum information

TI Novel real number representations in Ising machines and performance
   evaluation: Combinatorial random number sum and constant division
SO PLOS ONE
AB Quantum annealing machines are next-generation computers for solving combinatorial optimization problems. Although physical simulations are one of the most promising applications of quantum annealing machines, a method how to embed the target problem into the machines has not been developed except for certain simple examples. In this study, we focus on a method of representing real numbers using binary variables, or quantum bits. One of the most important problems for conducting physical simulation by quantum annealing machines is how to represent the real number with quantum bits. The variables in physical simulations are often represented by real numbers but real numbers must be represented by a combination of binary variables in quantum annealing, such as quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO). Conventionally, real numbers have been represented by assigning each digit of their binary number representation to a binary variable. Considering the classical annealing point of view, we noticed that when real numbers are represented in binary numbers, there are numbers that can only be reached by inverting several bits simultaneously under the restriction of not increasing a given Hamiltonian, which makes the optimization very difficult. In this work, we propose three new types of real number representation and compared these representations under the problem of solving linear equations. As a result, we found experimentally that the accuracy of the solution varies significantly depending on how the real numbers are represented. We also found that the most appropriate representation depends on the size and difficulty of the problem to be solved and that these differences show a consistent trend for two annealing solvers. Finally, we explain the reasons for these differences using simple models, the minimum required number of simultaneous bit flips, one-way probabilistic bit-flip energy minimization, and simulation of ideal quantum annealing machine.

TI High- and Half-Degree Quantum Multiplication for Post-Quantum Security
   Evaluation
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB This paper provides a thorough examination of strategies related to the design of the polynomial multiplication approach, which is essential to resolving large number operations, including multiplication in the post-quantum cryptography algorithm. Our research specifically centers on the implementation of Toom-Cook-based multiplication algorithms for high- and half-degree quantum multiplication, up to 20.5way degrees, considering that existing Toom-Cook lower degrees are combined with a lattice-based approach like the Saber algorithm. In particular, we propose the quantum multiplication design, conduct computation step experiments, and implement the division-free method. In addition to examining the Toom-Cook 20.5way algorithm, this study also provides an overview of the results obtained from the Toom-Cook 8.5-way and Toom-Cook 10.5-way algorithms. The Toom-Cook 20.5-way design exhibits significant performance improvement over its predecessor, as evidenced by its lower value of asymptotic complexity and lower cost of quantum implementation, with a qubit count of n1.186, approximately 522nlog21 41 - 540n Toffoli count, and n1.033 Toffoli depth. Concerning the asymptotic performance analysis and quantum cost compared to alternative Toom-Cook-based multiplication, the results indicate the development of a more efficient multiplication polynomial that may be utilized in the evaluation of post-quantum security.

AB In this paper, we report the first quantum key-recovery attack on a symmetric block cipher design, using classical queries only, with a more than quadratic time speedup compared to the best classical attack.
   We study the 2XOR-Cascade construction of Ga.zi and Tessaro (EUROCRYPT 2012). It is a key length extension technique which provides an n-bit block cipher with 5n/2 bits of security out of an n-bit block cipher with 2n bits of key, with a security proof in the ideal model. We show that the offline-Simon algorithm of Bonnetain et al. (ASIACRYPT 2019) can be extended to, in particular, attack this construction in quantum time (O) over tilde (2(n)), providing a 2.5 quantum speedup over the best classical attack.
   Regarding post-quantum security of symmetric ciphers, it is commonly assumed that doubling the key sizes is a sufficient precaution. This is because Grover's quantum search algorithm, and its derivatives, can only reach a quadratic speedup at most. Our attack shows that the structure of some symmetric constructions can be exploited to overcome this limit. In particular, the 2XOR-Cascade cannot be used to generically strengthen block ciphers against quantum adversaries, as it would offer only the same security as the block cipher itself.

TI Quantum fluctuations and correlations in open quantum Dicke models
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB In the vicinity of ground-state phase transitions quantum correlations can display nonanalytic behavior and critical scaling. This signature of emergent collective effects has been widely investigated within a broad range of equilibrium settings. However, under nonequilibrium conditions, as found in open quantum many-body systems, characterizing quantum correlations near phase transitions is challenging. Moreover, the impact of local and collective dissipative processes on quantum correlations is not broadly understood. Here we consider as a paradigmatic setting the superradiant phase transition of the open quantum Dicke model and characterize quantum and classical correlations across the phase diagram. We develop an approach to quantum fluctuations which allows us to show that local dissipation, which cannot be treated within the commonly employed Holstein-Primakoff approximation, rather unexpectedly leads to an enhancement of collective quantum correlations, and to the emergence of a nonequilibrium superradiant phase in which the bosonic and spin degrees of freedom of the Dicke model are entangled.

SO ADVANCED QUANTUM TECHNOLOGIES
AB The universal quantum computation provides a new paradigm for information processing. One feasible approach is measurement-based one-way quantum computation utilizing cluster states. Generally, the generation of cluster states with different structures for implementing on-demand quantum computation needs different experimental setup, which limits its scalability. Here, the reconfigurable hexapartite cluster states created by postprocessing the quadrature information of hexapartite entangled state are demonstrated. Without altering the experimental layout, nine quantum correlated states with different structures, especially three cluster states, are implemented. In particular, such method can effectively reduce the excess noise introduced by creating cluster states under limited squeezing resources. This approach provides an avenue for realizing large-scale reconfigurable cluster states without changing the experimental architecture.

TI High-fidelity Raman matterwave control by composite biased rotations
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Precise control of hyperfine matterwaves via Raman excitations is instrumental to a class of atom-based quantum technology. We investigate the Raman matterwave control technique for alkaline-like atoms in an intermediate regime characterized by the single-photon detuning where a choice can be made to balance the Raman excitation power efficiency with the control speed, excited-state adiabatic elimination, and spontaneousemission suppression requirements. Within the regime, rotations of atomic spinors by the Raman coupling are biased by substantial light shifts. Taking advantage of the fixed bias angle, we show that composite biased rotations can be optimized to enable precise ensemble spinor matterwave control within nanoseconds, even for multiple Zeeman pseudospins defined on the hyperfine ground states and when the laser illumination is strongly inhomogeneous. Our scheme fills a technical gap in light pulse atom interferometry for achieving high-speed Raman spinor matterwave control with moderate laser power.

TI Dicke superradiant heat current enhancement in circuit quantum
   electrodynamics
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Controlling the flow of energy and heat at the microscale is crucial to achieve energy-efficient quantum technologies, for on-chip thermal management, and to realize quantum heat engines and refrigerators. Yet, the efficiency of current quantum technologies is affected by thermal noise, and efficient cooling of quantum devices remains challenging in various solid-state implementations such as superconducting circuits. Collective effects, such as the Dicke superradiant emission, have been exploited to enhance the performance of quantum devices. However, the inherently transient nature of Dicke superradiant emission raises questions about its impact on steady-state properties. Here, we study how to enhance the steady-state heat current flowing between a hot bath and a cold bath through an ensemble of N qubits, that are collectively coupled to the thermal baths. Remarkably, we find a regime where the heat current scales quadratically with N in a finite-size scenario. Conversely, when approaching the thermodynamic limit, we prove that the collective scenario exhibits a parametric enhancement over the noncollective case. We then consider the presence of a third uncontrolled parasitic bath, interacting locally with each qubit, that models unavoidable couplings to the external environment. Despite having a nonperturbative effect on the steady-state currents, we show that the collective enhancement is robust to such an addition. Finally, we discuss the feasibility of realizing such a Dicke heat valve with superconducting circuits. Our findings indicate that in a minimal realistic experimental setting with two superconducting qubits, the collective advantage offers an enhancement of approximately 10% compared to the noncollective scenario.

TI Quantum and Approximation Algorithms for Maximum Witnesses of Boolean
   Matrix Products
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF FOUNDATIONS OF COMPUTER SCIENCE
AB The problem of finding maximum (or minimum) witnesses of the Boolean product of two Boolean matrices (MW for short) has a number of important applications, in particular the all-pairs lowest common ancestor (LCA) problem in directed acyclic graphs (dags). The best known upper time-bound on the MW problem for nxn Boolean matrices of the form O(n(2:575)) has not been substantially improved since 2006. In order to obtain faster algorithms for this problem, we study quantum algorithms for MW and approximation algorithms for MW (in the classical computational model). Some of our quantum algorithms are input or output sensitive. Our fastest quantum algorithm for the MW problem, and consequently for the related problems, runs in time (O) over tilde (n(2+lambda/2)) = (O) over tilde (n(2:434)), where lambda satisfies the equation omega (1, lambda, 1) = 1 + 1:5 lambda and omega (1, lambda, 1) is the exponent of the multiplication of an n x n(lambda) matrix by an n lambda x n matrix. Next, we consider a relaxed version of the MW problem (in the classical model) asking for reporting a witness of bounded rank (the maximum witness has rank 1) for each non-zero entry of the matrix product. First, by adapting the fastest known algorithm for maximum witnesses, we obtain an algorithm for the relaxed problem that reports for each non-zero entry of the product matrix a witness of rank at most l in time (O) over tilde((n/l)n(omega(1,lognl,1))): Then, by reducing the relaxed problem to the so called k -witness problem, we provide an algorithm that reports for each non-zero entry C [i; j] of the product matrix C a witness of rank O([W-C (i,j)/k]), where W-C (i; j) is the number of witnesses for C[i; j], with high probability. The algorithm runs in (O) over tilde (n(omega)k(0:4653) + n(2+o(1))k) time, where omega = omega(1; 1; 1).

AB Recent attempts to establish the quantum boundaries of life is pursued. A pre-existing view of quantum biology is supplemented by the formulation of modern advances in theoretical chemical physics and quantum chemistry. The extension to open system dynamics entails a self-referential amplification supporting the signature of life as well as consciousness via long-range correlative information, ODLCI. The associated negentropic coherence permeates hierarchical and functional organization at multiple levels. In this communication we will derive and review one of the most important mathematical tools, i.e., the combined use of the Fourier- and the Laplace transform. It is shown that an underlying operator algebra facilitates the formulation of the conjugate relationship between energy-time and momentum-space. Implications from augmented general dilation analytic operator families provide novel information-based representations and yield, inter alia, a thermo-qubit syntax for communication, which are required to support the quantum Darwinian view of life.</p>

TI Quantum-Inspired Classification Based on Voronoi Tessellation and
   Pretty-Good Measurements
SO QUANTUM REPORTS
AB In quantum machine learning, feature vectors are encoded into quantum states. Measurements for the discrimination of states are useful tools for classification problems. Classification algorithms inspired by quantum state discrimination have recently been implemented on classical computers. We present a local approach combining Vonoroi-type tessellation of a training set with pretty-good measurements for quantum state discrimination.

TI Positively factorizable maps
SO LINEAR ALGEBRA AND ITS APPLICATIONS
AB We initiate a study of linear maps on M-n(C) that have the property that they factor through a tracial von Neumann algebra (A, tau) via operators Z is an element of M-n(A) whose entries consist of positive elements from the von-Neumann algebra. These maps often arise in the context of non-local games especially in the synchronous case. We establish a connection with the convex sets in R-n containing self-dual cones and the existence of these maps. The Choi matrix of a map of this kind which factor through an abelian von-Neumann algebra turns out to be a completely positive (CP) matrix. We fully characterize positively factorizable maps whose Choi rank is 2. We also provide some applications of this analysis in finding doubly nonnegative matrices which are not CPSD. A special class of these examples are found from the concept of Unextendible Product Bases in quantum information theory. (c) 2021 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI Long-Distance Transmon Coupler with CZ-Gate Fidelity above 99.8%
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB Tunable coupling of superconducting qubits has been widely studied due to its importance for isolated gate operations in scalable quantum processor architectures. Here, we demonstrate a tunable qubit-qubit coupler based on a floating transmon device, which allows us to place qubits at least 2 mm apart from each other while maintaining over 50-MHz coupling between the coupler and the qubits. In the introduced tunable-coupler design, both the qubit-qubit and the qubit-coupler couplings are mediated by two waveg-uides instead of relying on direct capacitive couplings between the components, reducing the impact of the qubit-qubit distance on the couplings. This leaves space for each qubit to have an individual read-out resonator and a Purcell filter, which is needed for fast high-fidelity readout. In addition, simulations show that the large qubit-qubit distance significantly lowers unwanted non-nearest-neighbor coupling and allows multiple control lines to cross over the structure with minimal crosstalk. Using the proposed flexible and scalable architecture, we demonstrate a controlled -Z gate with (99.81 +/- 0.02)% fidelity.

TI Noise-assisted variational quantum thermalization
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB Preparing thermal states on a quantum computer can have a variety of applications, from simulating many-body quantum systems to training machine learning models. Variational circuits have been proposed for this task on near-term quantum computers, but several challenges remain, such as finding a scalable cost-function, avoiding the need of purification, and mitigating noise effects. We propose a new algorithm for thermal state preparation that tackles those three challenges by exploiting the noise of quantum circuits. We consider a variational architecture containing a depolarizing channel after each unitary layer, with the ability to directly control the level of noise. We derive a closed-form approximation for the free-energy of such circuit and use it as a cost function for our variational algorithm. By evaluating our method on a variety of Hamiltonians and system sizes, we find several systems for which the thermal state can be approximated with a high fidelity. However, we also show that the ability for our algorithm to learn the thermal state strongly depends on the temperature: while a high fidelity can be obtained for high and low temperatures, we identify a specific range for which the problem becomes more challenging. We hope that this first study on noise-assisted thermal state preparation will inspire future research on exploiting noise in variational algorithms.

TI Quantum-Noise-Driven Generative Diffusion Models
SO ADVANCED QUANTUM TECHNOLOGIES
AB Generative models realized with Machine Learning (ML) techniques are powerful tools to infer complex and unknown data distributions from a finite number of training samples in order to produce new synthetic data. Diffusion Models (DMs) are an emerging framework that have recently overcome Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) in creating high-quality images. Here, is proposed and discussed the quantum generalization of DMs, i.e., three Quantum-Noise-Driven Generative Diffusion Models (QNDGDMs) that could be experimentally tested on real quantum systems. The idea is to harness unique quantum features, in particular the non-trivial interplay among coherence, entanglement, and noise that the currently available noisy quantum processors do unavoidably suffer from, in order to overcome the main computational burdens of classical diffusion models during inference. Hence, the suggestion is to exploit quantum noise not as an issue to be detected and solved but instead as a beneficial key ingredient to generate complex probability distributions from which a quantum processor might sample more efficiently than a classical one. Three examples of the numerical simulations are also included for the proposed approaches. The results are expected to pave the way for new quantum-inspired or quantum-based generative diffusion algorithms addressing tasks as data generation with widespread real-world applications.
   Diffusion Models (DMs) are today a very popular class of generative models for Machine Learning (ML), using a noisy dynamics to learn an unknown density probability of a finite set of samples in order to generate new synthetic data. This study proposes a method to generalize them into the quantum domain by introducing and investigating what are termed Quantum-Noise-Driven Generative Diffusion Models (QNDGDMs). image

TI Digital-analog simulations of Schrödinger cat states in the Dicke-Ising
   model
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB The Dicke-Ising model, one of the few paradigmatic models of matter-light interaction, exhibits a superradiant quantum phase transition above a critical coupling strength. However, in natural optical systems, its experimental validation is hindered by a "no-go theorem." Here, we propose a digital-analog quantum simulator for this model based on an ensemble of interacting qubits coupled to a single-mode photonic resonator. We analyze the system's free-energy landscape using field-theoretical methods and develop a digital-analog quantum algorithm that disentangles qubit and photon degrees of freedom through a parity-measurement protocol. This disentangling enables the emulation of a photonic Schr & ouml;dinger cat state, which is a hallmark of the superradiant ground state in finite-size systems and can be unambiguously probed through the Wigner tomography of the resonator's field.

AB The implementation of large-scale fault-tolerant quantum computers calls for the integration of millions of physical qubits with very low error rates. This outstanding engineering challenge may benefit from emerging qubits that are protected from dominating noise sources in the qubits' environment. In addition to different noise reduction techniques, protective approaches typically encode qubits in global or local decoherence-free subspaces, or in dynamical sweet spots of driven systems. We exemplify such protected qubits by reviewing the state-of-art in protected solid-state qubits based on semiconductors, superconductors, and hybrid devices.

SO ANNALES DE L INSTITUT HENRI POINCARE D
AB In this article, we investigate meandric systems having one shallow side: the arch configuration on that side has depth at most two. This class of meandric systems was introduced and extensively examined by I. P. Goulden, A. Nica, and D. Puder [Int. Math. Res. Not. IMRN 2020 (2020), 983-1034]. Shallow arch configurations are in bijection with the set of interval partitions. We study meandric systems by using moment-cumulant transforms for noncrossing and interval partitions, corresponding to the notions of free and Boolean independence, respectively, in non -commutative probability. We obtain formulas for the generating series of different classes of meandric systems with one shallow side by explicitly enumerating the simpler, irreducible objects. In addition, we propose random matrix models for the corresponding meandric polynomials, which can be described in the language of quantum information theory, in particular that of quantum channels.

TI Comparison of spontaneous emission in trapped-ion multiqubit gates at
   high magnetic fields
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Penning traps have been used for performing quantum simulations and sensing with hundreds of ions and provide a promising route toward scaling up trapped ion quantum platforms because of the ability to trap and control hundreds or thousands of ions in two- and three-dimensional crystals. In both Penning traps and the more common radiofrequency Paul traps, lasers are often used to drive multiqubit entangling operations. A leading source of decoherence in these operations is off-resonant spontaneous emission. While many trapped ion quantum computers or simulators utilize clock qubits, other systems, especially those with high magnetic fields such as Penning traps, rely on Zeeman qubits, which require a more complex calculation of this decoherence. We therefore examine theoretically the impacts of spontaneous emission on quantum gates performed with trapped-ion ground-state Zeeman qubits in a high magnetic field. In particular, we consider two types of gates-light-shift (sigma(z)(i) sigma(z)(j)) gates and Mt lmer-St rensen (sigma(x)(i) sigma(x)(j)) gates-obtained with laser beams directed approximately perpendicular to the magnetic field (the quantization axis) and compare the decoherence errors in each. Within each gate type, we also compare different operating points with regard to the detunings, polarizations, and required intensity of the laser beams used to drive the gates. We show that both gates can have similar performance at their optimal operating conditions at high magnetic fields and examine the experimental feasibility of various operating points. By examining the magnetic field dependence of each gate, we demonstrate that, when the P state fine-structure splitting is large compared to the Zeeman splittings, the theoretical performance of the Mt lmer-St rensen gate is significantly better than that of the light-shift gate. Additionally, for the light-shift gate, we make an approximate comparison between the fidelities that can be achieved at high fields with the fidelities of state-of-the-art two-qubit trapped ion quantum gates. We show that, with regard to spontaneous emission, the achievable infidelity with our current configuration is about an order of magnitude larger than that of the best low-field gates, but we also discuss several alternative configurations with potential error rates that are comparable with those for state-of-the-art trapped ion gates.

AB In this paper, the generalized quantum states, i.e. positive and normalized linear functionals on C*-algebras, are studied. First., we study normal states, i.e. states which are represented by density operators, and singular states, i.e. states cannot be represented by density operators. It is given an approach to the resolution of bounded linear functionals into quantum states by applying the Gelfand-Neumark-Segal (GNS) construction, i.e. the fundamental result of Gelfand, Neumark and Segal on the representation theory of C*-algebras, and theory of projections. Second, it is given an application in quantum information theory. We study covariant cloners, i.e. quantum channels in the Heisenberg and the Schrodinger pictures which are covariant by shifting, and it is shown that the optimal cloners cannot. have a singular component. Finally, we discuss on the representation of pure states in the sense of the Gelfand-Pettis integral. We also give physical interpretations and examples in different sections of this work.

TI Loop-string-hadron formulation of an SU(3) gauge theory with dynamical
   quarks
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW D
AB Toward the goal of quantum computing for lattice quantum chromodynamics, we present a loop-stringhadron (LSH) framework in 1 thorn 1 dimensions for describing the dynamics of SU(3) gauge fields coupled to staggered fermions. This novel framework was previously developed for an SU(2) lattice gauge theory in d <= 3 spatial dimensions, and its advantages for classical and quantum algorithms have thus far been demonstrated in d 1/4 1. The LSH approach uses gauge-invariant degrees of freedoms such as loop segments, string ends, and on-site hadrons, it is free of all non-Abelian gauge redundancy, and it is described by a Hamiltonian containing only local interactions. In this work, the SU(3) LSH framework is systematically derived from the reformulation of Hamiltonian lattice gauge theory in terms of irreducible Schwinger bosons, including the addition of staggered quarks. Furthermore, the superselection rules governing the LSH dynamics are identified directly from the form of the Hamiltonian. The SU(3) LSH Hamiltonian with open boundary conditions has been numerically confirmed to agree with the completely gauge-fixed Hamiltonian, which contains long-range interactions and does not generalize either to periodic boundary conditions or to d > 1.

TI Time-optimal control of a solid-state spin amidst dynamical quantum wind
SO NPJ QUANTUM INFORMATION
AB Time-optimal control holds promise across the full spectrum of quantum technologies, where the rapid generation of unitary gates and state transformations is crucial to mitigate decoherence effects. In practical scenarios, quantum systems are always immersed in an external time-dependent field or potential, either owing to the inevitable influence of the environment or as a sought-after effect for enhanced coherence. The challenge then lies in finding the time-optimal approach to navigate quantum systems amidst dynamical ambient Hamiltonians, a pursuit that has proven elusive thus far. We showcase the implementation of arbitrary quantum state transformations and a universal set of single-qubit gates under a background Landau-Zener Hamiltonian. Leveraging the favorable coherence properties of timedomain Rabi oscillations, we achieve velocities surpassing the Mandelstam-Tamm quantum speed limit and significantly lower energy costs than those incurred by conventional quantum control techniques. These findings highlight a promising pathway to expedite and economize high-fidelity quantum operations.

TI Comparison of quantum-walk implementations on noisy intermediate-scale
   quantum computers
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB This paper explores two circuit approaches for quantum walks: The first consists of generalized controlled inversions, whereas the second one effectively replaces them with rotation operations around the basis states. We show the theoretical foundation of the rotational implementation. The rotational approach nullifies the large amount of ancilla qubits required to carry out the computation when using the inverter implementation. Our results concentrate around the comparison of the two architectures in terms of structure, benefits, and detriments, as well as the computational resources needed for each approach. We show that the inverter approach requires exponentially fewer gates than the rotations but almost half the number of qubits in the system. Finally, we execute a number of experiments using an IBM quantum computer. The experiments show the effects of noise in our circuits. Small two-qubit quantum walks evolve closer to our expectations, whereas for a larger number of steps or state space the evolution is severely affected by noise.

TI Optimal generation of mesoscopic twin-beam states by means of a natively
   femtosecond laser system
SO APL PHOTONICS
AB Mesoscopic twin-beam states, which exhibit robust nonclassical correlations, hold significant potential for applications in quantum technologies, including underwater quantum communication and quantum metrology. As Ytterbium-based lasers delivering sub-picosecond pulses are becoming the cornerstone of ultrafast photonics, optimizing the generation of quantum states of light driven by such short pulses while avoiding the presence of noise sources, such as spurious light, is also becoming essential. To this end, we propose an optical scheme that delivers well-populated entangled states in the red spectral region by pumping parametric down-conversion with optically tilted pulses, addressing the limited gain caused by group velocity mismatch between the driving pump field and the generated quantum radiation. The results obtained so far encourage the exploitation of this source in further optical schemes. (c) 2025 Author(s).

TI Linear-optical protocols for mitigating and suppressing noise in bosonic
   systems
SO QUANTUM SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB Quantum-information processing and computation with bosonic qubits are corruptible by noise channels. Using interferometers and photon-subtraction gadgets (PSGs) accompanied by linear amplification and attenuation, we establish linear-optical methods to mitigate and suppress bosonic noise channels. We first show that by employing amplifying and attenuating PSGs respectively at the input and output of either a thermal or random-displacement channel, probabilistic error cancellation (PEC) can be carried out to mitigate errors in expectation-value estimation. We also derive optimal physical estimators that are properly constrained to improve the sampling accuracy of PEC. Next, we prove that a purely-dephasing channel is coherently suppressible using a multimode Mach-Zehnder interferometer and conditional vacuum measurements (vacuum-based Mach-Zehnder scheme or the VMZ scheme). In the limit of infinitely-many ancillas, with nonvanishing success rates, VMZ using either Hadamard or two-design interferometers turns any dephasing channel into a phase-space-rotated linear-attenuation channel that can subsequently be inverted with (rotated) linear amplification without Kerr nonlinearity. Moreover, for weak central-Gaussian dephasing, the suppression fidelity increases monotonically with the number of ancillas and most optimally with Hadamard interferometers. We demonstrate the performance of these linear-optical mitigation and suppression schemes on common noise channels (and their compositions) and popular bosonic codes. While the theoretical formalism pertains to idling noise channels, we also provide numerical evidence supporting mitigation and suppression capabilities with respect to noise from universal gate operations.

TI Quantum State Estimation for Real-Time Battery Health Monitoring in
   Photovoltaic Storage Systems
SO ENERGIES
AB The growing deployment of photovoltaic (PV) and energy storage systems (ESSs) in power grids has amplified concerns over component degradation, which undermines efficiency, increases costs, and shortens system lifespan. This paper proposes a quantum-enhanced optimization framework to mitigate degradation impacts in PV-storage systems through real-time adaptive energy dispatch. The framework combines quantum-assisted Monte Carlo simulation, quantum annealing, and reinforcement learning to model and optimize degradation pathways. A predictive maintenance module proactively adjusts charge-discharge cycles based on probabilistic forecasts of degradation states, improving resilience and operational efficiency. A hierarchical structure enables real-time degradation assessment, hourly dispatch optimization, and weekly long-term adjustments. The model is validated on a 5 MW PV array with a 2.5 MWh lithium-ion battery using real degradation profiles. Results demonstrate that the proposed framework reduces battery wear by 25% and extends PV module lifespan by approximately 2.5 years compared to classical methods. The hybrid quantum-classical implementation achieves scalable optimization under uncertainty, enabling faster convergence across high-dimensional solution spaces. This study introduces a novel paradigm in degradation-aware energy management, highlighting the potential of quantum computing to enhance both the sustainability and real-time control of renewable energy systems.

TI Pulse-Level Quantum Robust Control with Diffusion-Based Reinforcement
   Learning
SO ADVANCED PHYSICS RESEARCH
AB The pulse-level quantum control presents a large range of external parameter dependencies, including control field noise, frequency detuning, nonlinearities, and uncertainty of Hamiltonian parameters, which can lead to significant deviation from the target quantum gate. These terms are not usually considered directly in standard optimization scenarios for robustness, but are often found in analytical solutions. The latter are often difficult to emerge and generalize to different settings. This paper proposes a diffusion-based reinforcement learning method for pulse-level quantum robust control (PQC-DBRL) to enhance the robustness of pulse-level quantum gate control. PQC-DBRL does not require an accurate Hamiltonian model of the underlying system, effectively mitigating deviations from target quantum gates caused by control field noise and parameter uncertainties. The quantum pulse control problem is formulated as a conditional generative modeling task, leveraging diffusion reinforcement learning to capture unobserved system information. Furthermore, the results show that PQC-DBRL pulses maintain a fidelity greater than 0.95 for 100% of the cases and greater than 0.999 for 32.16% of the cases, outperforming GRAPE, which achieves 0.999 fidelity for only 12.48% of the cases under the same noise conditions. In large-scale experiments with repeated gate operations, PQC-DBRL demonstrates significantly higher resilience to cumulative errors, maintaining fidelity advantages even after 200 gate repetitions. Additionally, when evaluated across different Hamiltonian variations, PQC-DBRL shows smaller fidelity variance compared to GRAPE, indicating higher robustness against system parameter fluctuations. This paper offers a promising solution to scalable, noise-resilient quantum control in practical quantum computing applications.

TI Validity of Born-Markov master equations for single- and two-qubit
   systems
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
AB The urgent need for reliable simulation tools to match the extreme accuracy needed to control tailored quantum devices highlights the importance of understanding open quantum systems and their modeling. To this end, we compare here the commonly used Redfield and Lindblad master equations against numerically exact results in the case of one and two resonant qubits transversely coupled at a single point to a Drude-cut ohmic bath. All the relevant parameters are varied over a broad range, which allows us to give detailed predictions about the validity and physically meaningful applicability of the weak-coupling approaches. We characterize the accuracy of the approximate approaches by comparing the maximum difference of their system evolution superoperators with numerically exact results. After optimizing the parameters of the approximate models to minimize the difference, we also explore if and to what extent the weak-coupling equations can be applied at least as phenomenological models. Optimization may lead to an accurate reproduction of experimental data, but yet our results are important to estimate the reliability of the extracted parameter values such as the bath temperature. Our findings set general guidelines for the range of validity of the usual Born-Markov master equations and indicate that they fail to accurately describe the physics in a surprisingly broad range of parameters, in particular, at low temperatures. Since quantum-technological devices operate there, their accurate modeling calls for a careful choice of methods.

TI Entangled Photon Pair Generation in the Telecom O-Band from Nanowire
   Quantum Dots
SO NANO LETTERS
AB Entangled photon pairs at telecom wavelengths are essential for quantum communication, distributed computing, and quantum-enhanced sensing. The telecom O-band offers low chromatic dispersion and fiber loss, which is ideal for long-distance networks. Site-controlled nanowire quantum dots have emerged as a promising platform for generating single and entangled photons, offering high extraction efficiency and scalability. However, their operation has largely been restricted to the visible and first near-infrared (NIR-I) windows. Here, we demonstrate a bright source of entangled photon pairs in the telecom O-band based on site-controlled nanowire quantum dots. We measure a fine-structure splitting of 4.6 mu eV, confirming suitability for high-fidelity polarization entanglement. Quantum-state tomography of the biexciton-exciton cascade reveals a maximum fidelity of 85.8 +/- 1.1% to the Phi+ Bell state and a maximum concurrence of 75.1 +/- 2.1%. This work establishes nanowire quantum dots as viable entangled photon sources at telecom, advancing scalable quantum technologies for fiber-based networks.

TI Time-division technique for quantum optical receivers utilizing
   single-photon detector array technology and spatial-multiplexing
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB Free-space quantum key distribution (QKD) has been gaining popularity in recent years due to its advantages in creating networking options for the quantum internet. One of the main challenges to be addressed in QKD is the achievable secret key rate, which must meet current and future demand. Some of the existing solutions include the use of higher bandwidth electronics, untrusted relay architectures such as Twin-Field QKD, or high dimensional QKD. In this work, we proposed the use of a combination of spatial-multiplexing and time-division techniques, together with the use of 2D single-photon avalanche diode arrays to increase the final throughput. The main challenge in a free-space scenario is the effects introduced by turbulence. This paper demonstrates how appropriate time-division of the spatial-modes can reduce the quantum bit error rate due to optical crosstalk from 36% to 0%. With this technique, we believe the future need for superconducting nanowires single photon detectors, in some free-space QKD applications, can be relaxed, obtaining more cost-effective receiver systems.

TI Quantum Sensitive, Record Dynamic Range Terahertz Tunnel Field-Effect
   Transistor Detectors Exploiting Multilayer Graphene/hBN/Bilayer
   Graphene/hBN Heterostructures
SO NANO LETTERS
AB Sensitive photodetectors showing large quantum efficiencies and broad dynamic ranges are essential components for on-chip integrated photonic quantum platforms and for probing quantum correlations in metrological sources. However, at terahertz (THz) frequencies, this is a very challenging task owing to the lack of high-absorption materials and thermal effects that impact their noise figure. Here, we develop antenna-coupled tunnel field-effect transistors, based on multilayer graphene/hBN/bilayer graphene/hBN that detect multiwavelength beams at frequencies similar to 3 THz with record performances. We reach noise-equivalent powers of similar to 10-12 WHz-1/2, a power dynamic range exceeding 5 orders of magnitude, limited by the maximum output power (0.8 mW) of the employed source, and a minimum detectable power at the nW-level, in a frequency-scalable device architecture. Our results open intriguing perspectives for the statistical analysis of quantum intensity correlations in nonclassical light sources operating in the underexploited THz frequency gap, between technologically mature domains (microwave, visible, near-infrared) that currently dominate the field of quantum technologies.

TI Fundamental limits of pulsed quantum light spectroscopy: Dipole moment
   estimation
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB We study the fundamental limits of the precision of estimating parameters of a quantum matter system when it is probed by a traveling pulse of quantum light. In particular, we focus on the estimation of the interaction strength between the pulse and a two-level atom, equivalent to the estimation of the dipole moment. Our analysis of single-photon pulses highlights the interplay between the information gained from the absorption of the photon by the atom as measured in absorption spectroscopy and the perturbation to the temporal mode of the photon due to spontaneous emission. Beyond the single-photon regime, we introduce an approximate model to study more general states of light in the limit of short pulses, where spontaneous emission can be neglected. We also show that for a vast class of entangled biphoton states, quantum entanglement between the signal mode interacting with the atom and the idler mode provides no fundamental advantage and the same precision can be obtained with a separable state. We conclude by studying the estimation of the electric dipole moment of a sodium atom using quantum light. Our work initiates a quantum information-theoretic methodology for developing the theory and practice of quantum light spectroscopy.

TI Quantum clustering and jet reconstruction at the LHC
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW D
AB Clustering is one of the most frequent problems in many domains, in particular, in particle physics where jet reconstruction is central in experimental analyses. Jet clustering at the CERN's Large Hadron Collider (LHC) is computationally expensive and the difficulty of this task will increase with the upcoming High-Luminosity LHC (HL-LHC). In this paper, we study the case in which quantum computing algorithms might improve jet clustering by considering two novel quantum algorithms which may speed up the classical jet clustering algorithms. The first one is a quantum subroutine to compute a Minkowski-based distance between two data points, whereas the second one consists of a quantum circuit to track the maximum into a list of unsorted data. The latter algorithm could be of value beyond particle physics, for instance in statistics. When one or both of these algorithms are implemented into the classical versions of well-known clustering algorithms (K-means, affinity propagation, and k(T) -jet) we obtain efficiencies comparable to those of their classical counterparts. Even more, exponential speed-up could be achieved, in the first two algorithms, in data dimensionality and data length when the distance algorithm or the maximum searching algorithm are applied.

TI Two-photon interference between an independent laser and single photons
   with ultralong coherence time
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Two-photon interference (TPI) underpins many photonic quantum technologies and is commonly regarded as a quantum effect requiring indistinguishable photons. Here, we demonstrate TPI between single photons with ultralong coherence time and an independent continuous-wave laser. The measurements reveal a sharp antibunching dip, governed by the single-photon correlation time, together with a broad Hong-Ou-Mandel dip whose half-width is set by the mutual coherence time of the two sources. We achieve a maximum TPI visibility of 72 +/- 2%, well above the 50% classical limit, thereby confirming the quantum nature of TPI. At the same time, we observe a broad visibility background and a beat visibility below 50%, signatures of classical interference. Both quantum and classical visibility features remain unchanged for frequency separations up to 104 times the linewidth of the single photons, showing no distinction between distinguishable and indistinguishable photons. By applying both general wave superposition theory and a quantum field approach, we derive the same cross-correlation functions that quantitatively reproduce the data. Our results show that quantum and classical features of TPI originate from the same underlying fourth-order interference process arising from second-order interference within the mutual coherence time. Photon indistinguishability is a sufficient condition for TPI to occur, but not a necessary one. This insight offers different perspectives for the development of quantum photonic technologies based on independent photons.

TI Quantum Pin Codes
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INFORMATION THEORY
AB We introduce quantum pin codes: a class of quantum CSS codes. Quantum pin codes are a generalization of quantum color codes and Reed-Muller codes and share a lot of their structure and properties. Pin codes have gauge operators, an unfolding procedure and their stabilizers form so-called l-orthogonal spaces meaning that the joint overlap between any l stabilizer elements is always even. This last feature makes them interesting for devising magic-state distillation protocols, for instance by using puncturing techniques. We study examples of these codes and their properties.

TI Entanglement monogamy in indistinguishable particle systems
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB Recently, it has been realized that indistinguishability is a resource for quantum information processing. A new method to represent the indistinguishable particles by Franco et al. (Sci Rep 6:20603, 2016, https://doi.org/10.1038/srep20603) and measure the concurrence is developed by Nosrati et al. (npj Quantum Inf 6:39, 2020, https://doi.org/10.1038/s41534-020-0271-7). The monogamy property says that quantum entanglement cannot be shared freely between more than two particles. For three distinguishable particles, the monogamy of entanglement was first expressed as an inequality using squared concurrence where each particle has a single degree of freedom (for pure or mixed states). Using multiple degrees of freedom, similar inequality was shown to be held between two distinguishable particles. However, for two indistinguishable particles, where each particle cannot be addressed individually, the monogamy inequality was shown to be violated maximally for a specific state. Thus a question naturally arises: what happens to the monogamy of entanglement in the case of three or more indistinguishable particles? We prove that monogamy holds in this scenario and the inequality becomes equality for all pure indistinguishable states. Further, we provide three major operational meanings of our result. Finally, we present an experimental schematic using photons to observe our result.

TI Mitigating algorithmic errors in quantum optimization through energy
   extrapolation
SO QUANTUM SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB Quantum optimization algorithms offer a promising route to finding the ground states of target Hamiltonians on near-term quantum devices. Nonetheless, it remains necessary to limit the evolution time and circuit depth as much as possible, since otherwise decoherence will degrade the computation. Even when this is done, there always exists a non-negligible error in estimates of the ground state energy. Here we present a scalable extrapolation approach to mitigating this algorithmic error, which significantly improves estimates obtained using three well-studied quantum optimization algorithms: quantum annealing (QA), the variational quantum eigensolver, and the quantum imaginary time evolution at fixed evolution time or circuit depth. The approach is based on extrapolating the annealing time to infinity or the variance of estimates to zero. The method is reasonably robust against noise. For Hamiltonians which only involve few-body interactions, the additional computational overhead is an increase in the number of measurements by a constant factor. Analytic derivations are provided for the quadratic convergence of estimates of energy as a function of time in QA, and the linear convergence of estimates as a function of variance in all three algorithms. We have verified the validity of these approaches through both numerical simulation and experiments on IBM quantum machines. This work suggests a promising new way to enhance near-term quantum computing through classical post-processing.

TI Experimental verification of the relationship between first-order
   coherence and linear steerability
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB Coherence and steerability are two essential characteristics of quantum systems. For a two-qubit state, the first-order coherence and the maximal violation of linear steering inequality are used to operationally measure the degree of coherence and steerability, respectively. Recently, a complementary relation between first-order coherence and linear steerability has been proposed. In this paper, we report an experimental verification of the complementary relation by preparing biphoton polarization entangled states in an all-optical setup. We propose an operable method for experimental measurement of the first-order coherence and linear steerability and calculate the purity of the initial states by reconstructing the density matrices of them. The experimental results coincide with the theoretical predictions very well, which provides a valuable reference for the application of optical quantum technology.

TI Quantum nonlinear spectroscopy of single nuclear spins
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Conventional nonlinear spectroscopy, which use classical probes, can only access a limited set of correlations in a quantum system. Here we demonstrate that quantum nonlinear spectroscopy, in which a quantum sensor and a quantum object are first entangled and the sensor is measured along a chosen basis, can extract arbitrary types and orders of correlations in a quantum system. We measured fourth-order correlations of single nuclear spins that cannot be measured in conventional nonlinear spectroscopy, using sequential weak measurement via a nitrogen-vacancy center in diamond. The quantum nonlinear spectroscopy provides fingerprint features to identify different types of objects, such as Gaussian noises, random-phased AC fields, and quantum spins, which would be indistinguishable in second-order correlations. This work constitutes an initial step toward the application of higher-order correlations to quantum sensing, to examining the quantum foundation (by, e.g., higher-order Leggett-Garg inequality), and to studying quantum many-body physics.
   Signals that look the same from their low-order correlations can often be distinguished by looking at higher-order ones. Here, the authors exploit the sensitivity of quantum nonlinear spectroscopy to fourth-order correlations to identify Gaussian noises, random-phased AC fields, and quantum spins.

TI Cryogenic amplification of image-charge detection for readout of quantum
   states of electrons on liquid helium
SO JOURNAL OF LOW TEMPERATURE PHYSICS
AB Accurate detection of quantum states is a vital step in the development of quantum computing. Image-charge detection of quantum states of electrons on liquid helium can potentially be used for the readout of a single-electron qubit; however, low sensitivity due to added noise hinders its usage in high-fidelity and high-bandwidth (BW) applications. One method to improve the readout accuracy and bandwidth is to use cryogenic amplifications near the signal source to minimize the effects of stray capacitance. We experimentally demonstrate a two-stage amplification scheme with a low power dissipation of 90 mu W at the first stage located at the still plate of the dilution refrigerator and a high gain of 40dB at the second stage located at the 4 K plate. The good impedance matching between different stages and output devices ensures high BW and constant gain in a wide frequency range. The detected image-charge signals are compared for one-stage and two-stage amplification schemes.

TI Analytical fidelity calculations for photonic linear cluster state
   generation
SO NANO CONVERGENCE
AB By precisely timed optical excitation of their spin, optical emitters such as semiconductor quantum dots or atoms can be harnessed as sources of linear photonic cluster states. This significantly reduces the required resource overhead to reach fault-tolerant optical quantum computing. Here, we develop an algorithm that analytically tracks the global density matrix through the process of the protocol for generating linear-cluster states by Lindner and Rudolph. From this we derive a model to calculate the entangling gate fidelity and the state fidelity of the generated linear optical cluster states. Our model factors in various sources of error, such as spin decoherence and the finite excited state lifetime. Additionally, we highlight the presence of partial reinitialization of spin coherence with each photon emission, eliminating the hard limitation of coherence time. Our framework provides valuable insight into the cost-to-improvement trade-offs for device design parameters as well as the identification of optimal working points.

TI Creation of Silicon-Vacancy Color Centers in Diamond by Ion Implantation
SO FRONTIERS IN PHYSICS
AB Silicon-vacancy (SiV) centers in diamond are gaining an increased interest for application, such as in quantum technologies and sensing. Due to the strong luminescence concentrated in its sharp zero-phonon line at room temperature, SiV centers are being investigated as single-photon sources for quantum communication, and also as temperature probes for sensing. Here, we discussed strategies for the fabrication of SiV centers in diamond based on Si-ion implantation followed by thermal activation. SiV color centers in high-quality single crystals have the best optical properties, but polycrystalline micro and nanostructures are interesting for applications in nano-optics. Moreover, we discuss the photoluminescence properties of SiV centers in phosphorous-doped diamond, which are relevant for the creation of electroluminescent devices, and nanophotonics strategies to improve the emission characteristics of the SiV centers. Finally, the optical properties of such centers at room and high temperatures show the robustness of the center and give perspectives for temperature-sensing applications.

TI Nickel Doping Unlocks Ambient-Condition Photostability in Individual
   Cesium Lead Bromide Perovskite Quantum Dots
SO NANO LETTERS
AB Developing efficient single-photon sources is fundamental to advancing photonic quantum technologies. In particular, achieving scalable, cost-effective, stable, and high-purity single-photon emission at ambient conditions is paramount for free-space quantum communication. However, fulfilling all the requirements simultaneously under ambient conditions has remained a significant challenge. Here we present the scalable, cost-effective ambient condition synthesis of nickel-doped CsPbBr3 perovskite quantum dots (NPQDs) using a modified ligand-assisted reprecipitation method. The resulting individual NPQDs demonstrate remarkable photostability, sustaining their performance for over 10 min under ambient conditions, and exhibit exceptional single-photon purity (>99%) with a narrow emission line width (similar to 70 meV). The remarkable photostability could be attributed to the spatial localization of the exciton by Ni atoms on the surface of the nanocrystal, reducing its interaction with the environment. Our results demonstrated that NPQDs with outstanding combinations of quantum emitting properties can be both synthesized and operated at ambient conditions.

TI Maximum and Minimum Causal Effects of Physical Processes
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB We introduce two quantitative measures of the strength of causal relations in quantum theory and more general physical theories. These two measures, called the maximum and minimum causal effect, quantify the maximum and minimum changes in the output of a quantum process induced by changes in its input. The maximum and minimum causal effect possesses useful properties, such as continuity and dataprocessing inequality. In quantum theory, they have close connections with quantum information tasks. The maximum quantum causal effect can be used to detect quantum channels with nonzero capacity for transmitting classical information. The minimum causal effect can be used to guarantee the recoverability of quantum information: every quantum process with a high value of the minimum quantum causal effect can be approximately inverted. Moreover, we show that the quantum causal effects satisfy a duality relation: if the minimum causal effect of a quantum system A on another quantum system B is high, then A must have a low value of the maximum causal effect on any other quantum system B' that is spacelike separated with B. This duality implies a monogamy relation for quantum causal effects, and represents a fundamental difference between quantum and classical causal relations. We illustrate the application of the maximum causal effect to the analysis of two paradigmatic examples, the first involving a coherent superposition of direct cause and common cause, and the second involving a coherent superposition of multiple quantum processes.

TI Applying a class of general maximally entangled states in
   measurement-device-independent quantum secure direct communication
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW APPLIED
AB Quantum entanglement is a fundamental physical resource that enables a range of informationprocessing tasks with no efficient solution on classical computers. In this paper, we construct a class of general maximum entangled states by parameterizing the coefficients of Bell states. By calculating, we obtain the local unitary operations required to realize the mutual transformation of the constructed states, analogous to Pauli operators acting on one particle of a Bell state. Interestingly, the local unitary operations on the two particles of Bell states are identical, whereas for the constructed states, they must differ in certain cases. To explore the potential applications of these maximum entangled states and the obtained local unitary operations, we design a class of measurement-device-independent quantum secure direct communication protocols based on entanglement swapping. In the class of designed protocols, entanglement swapping is realized between a constructed maximum entangled state and a Bell state. We demonstrate that the class of designed protocols have no information leakage and can resist interceptand-resend attacks, measure-resend attacks, and collective attacks. In addition, the unconditional security of the class of designed protocols is proved. We believe that the constructed maximum entangled states and the obtained local unitary operations may find applications in other quantum information-processing fields.

This paper proposes some new quantum variations of cyclotomic cosets for cyclic stabiliser construction. These variations are governed by several parameters which are devoted to designing the two essential parts: the error part and the position part of these cosets. Criteria on these cosets in generating additive cyclic stabiliser are extensively studied, followed by actual implementation on stabiliser codes construction of several selected classes of length.

TI Correcting and Extending Trotterized Quantum Many-Body Dynamics
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB A complex but important challenge in understanding quantum mechanical phenomena is the simulation of quantum many-body dynamics. Although quantum computers offer significant potential to accelerate these simulations, their practical application is currently limited by noise and restricted scalability. In this work, we address these problems by introducing a hybrid ansatz combining the strengths of quantum and classical computational methods. Using Trotterization, we propose to evolve an initial state on the quantum computer according to a simplified Hamiltonian, focusing on terms that are difficult to simulate classically. A classical model then corrects the simulation by including the terms omitted in the quantum circuit. While the classical ansatz is optimized during the time evolution, the quantum circuit has no variational parameters. Derivatives can thus be calculated purely classically, avoiding challenges arising in the optimization of parametrized quantum circuits. We demonstrate three applications of this hybrid method. First, our approach allows us to avoid SWAP gates in the quantum circuit by restricting the quantum part of the ansatz to hardware-efficient terms of the Hamiltonian. Second, we can mitigate errors arising from the Trotterization of the time-evolution unitary. Finally, we can extend the system size while keeping the number of qubits in the quantum circuit constant by including additional degrees of freedom in the classical ansatz.

AB The Boolean Matching Problem is a fundamental step in modern Electronic Design Automation toolchains, which allow the efficient design of large classical computers. In particular, the equivalence under negation-permutation-negation of two n-to- n vector Boolean functions requires the exploration of a super- exponential number of possible negations and permutations of input and output variables, and is widely regarded as a daunting challenge. Its classical complexity ( O(n!2(2n)), where n is the number of input and output variables) is rarely tolerated by EDA tools, which are typically solving small instances of the Boolean Matching Problem for n-to-1 Boolean functions. In this work, we present a method to exploit the solver for Simon's problem to speed-up the matching of n-to- n vector Boolean functions, as we show that, despite its higher complexity, it is friendlier to a quantum solver than matching single-output Boolean functions. Our solution allows saving a factor 2(n) in the overall worst-case computational effort, and is amenable to combined approaches such as the so-called Grover-meets-Simon, which have the potential of reducing it below the cost of classical n-to-1 matching. We provide a fully detailed quantum circuit implementing our proposal, and compute its cost, both counting the required amount of qubits and quantum gates. We conducted an experimental evaluation employing the ISCAS benchmark suite, a de-facto standard for classical EDA to derive our sample Boolean functions.

TI Monotonic manipulation of atomic density in an isovolumetric
   focused-beam trap for quantum atom experiments
SO SCIENCEASIA
AB We present an asymmetric focused-beam trap (FBT) of cold Rubidium-85 atoms. Unlike the cold atom preparation using the magneto-optical trap, the FBT has its path of cooling beam occupying only one axis. Since the experiments on these cold atoms usually require additional laser beams or other atom interacting sources, the FBT allows more optical and physical accessibility for these experiments. In our experiment, the cooling beams only occupied one axis, and the crossed repumping beams were in the transverse plane to the cooling beams. By varying the intensity of the repump laser, we have shown that the atomic cloud density can be monotonically manipulated from zero to the maximum value limited by the cooling power. With this monotonic control, we then computationally introduced a scheme for the precision loading of 1-6 atoms into the far-off-resonance optical dipole trap (FORT). Using the FBT for precision FORT loading could enable extensions toward the research areas, such as Rydberg atom, quantum simulation, and quantum computing.

AB This study investigates the use of spiral geometry in superconducting resonators to achieve high intrinsic quality factors, crucial for applications in quantum computation and quantum sensing. We fabricated Archimedean Spiral Resonators (ASRs) using domain-matched epitaxially grown titanium nitride (TiN) on silicon wafers, achieving intrinsic quality factors of Qi=(9.6 +/- 1.5)x106\documentclass[12pt]{minimal} \usepackage{amsmath} \usepackage{wasysym} \usepackage{amsfonts} \usepackage{amssymb} \usepackage{amsbsy} \usepackage{mathrsfs} \usepackage{upgreek} \setlength{\oddsidemargin}{-69pt} \begin{document}$Q_{\mathrm{i}} = (9.6 \pm 1.5) \times 10<^>{6}$\end{document} at the single-photon level and Qi=(9.91 +/- 0.39)x107\documentclass[12pt]{minimal} \usepackage{amsmath} \usepackage{wasysym} \usepackage{amsfonts} \usepackage{amssymb} \usepackage{amsbsy} \usepackage{mathrsfs} \usepackage{upgreek} \setlength{\oddsidemargin}{-69pt} \begin{document}$Q_{\mathrm{i}} = (9.91 \pm 0.39) \times 10<^>{7}$\end{document} at high power, which is more than twice as high as those for coplanar waveguide (CPW) resonators under identical conditions on the same chip. We conducted a comprehensive numerical analysis using COMSOL to calculate surface participation ratios (PRs) at critical interfaces: metal-air, metal-substrate, and substrate-air. Our findings reveal that ASRs have lower PRs than CPWs, explaining their superior quality factors and reduced coupling to two-level systems (TLSs).

TI Signatures of Andreev Blockade in a Double Quantum Dot Coupled to a
   Superconductor
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB We investigate an electron transport blockade regime in which a spin triplet localized in the path of current is forbidden from entering a spin-singlet superconductor. To stabilize the triplet, a double quantum dot is created electrostatically near a superconducting Al lead in an InAs nanowire. The quantum dot closest to the normal lead exhibits Coulomb diamonds, and the dot closest to the superconducting lead exhibits Andreev bound states and an induced gap. The experimental observations compare favorably to a theoretical model of Andreev blockade, named so because the triplet double dot configuration suppresses Andreev reflections. Observed leakage currents can be accounted for by finite temperature. We observe the predicted quadruple level degeneracy points of high current and a periodic conductance pattern controlled by the occupation of the normal dot. Even-odd transport asymmetry is lifted with increased temperature and magnetic field. This blockade phenomenon can be used to study spin structure of superconductors. It may also find utility in quantum computing devices that use Andreev or Majorana states.

TI Optical multi-beam steering and communication using integrated
   acousto-optics arrays
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Optical beam steering enables optical sensing, imaging, and long-range communication over free space. Despite the inherent speed of light, advanced applications increasingly require simultaneous steering of multiple, independently controlled beams, to enhance imaging throughput, boost communication bandwidth, and control qubit arrays for scalable quantum computing. However, precise multi-beam steering and control remain a significant challenge with current solid-state beam steering technologies, driving the need for integrated and scalable multi-beam steering solutions. Here, we report a scalable multi-beam steering system comprising an array of integrated acousto-optic beam steering channels on a thin-film lithium niobate platform. Each channel generates tens of individually controllable beams at 780 nm with sub-microsecond switching time by exciting acoustic waves using multi-tone microwave signals. We demonstrate the system's unique capabilities through multiple-input, multiple-output free-space communications, simultaneously transmitting to multiple receivers at megabits/sec data rates. This technology is readily scalable to steer hundreds of optical beams from a compact chip, potentially advancing many areas of optical technologies and enabling novel applications.

TI Optical Signatures of Defect Centers in Transition Metal Dichalcogenide
   Monolayers
SO ADVANCED QUANTUM TECHNOLOGIES
AB Even the best quality 2D materials have non-negligible concentrations of vacancies and impurities. It is critical to understand and quantify how defects change intrinsic properties, and use this knowledge to generate functionality. This challenge can be addressed by employing many-body perturbation theory to obtain the optical absorption spectra of defected transition metal dichalcogenides. Herein metal vacancies, which are largely unreported, show a larger set of polarized excitons than chalcogenide vacancies, introducing localized excitons in the sub-optical-gap region, whose wave functions and spectra make them good candidates as quantum emitters. Despite the strong interaction with substitutional defects, the spin texture and pristine exciton energies are preserved, enabling grafting and patterning in optical detectors, as the full optical-gap region remains available. A redistribution of excitonic weight between the A and B excitons is visible in both cases and may allow the quantification of the defect concentration. This work establishes excitonic signatures to characterize defects in 2D materials and highlights vacancies as qubit candidates for quantum computing.

TI Massively multiplexed wide-field photon correlation sensing
SO OPTICA
AB Temporal photon correlations have been a crucial resource for quantum and quantum-enabled optical science for over half a century. However, attaining non-classical information through these correlations has typically been limited to a single point (or, at best, a few points) at a time. Here, we perform a massively multiplexed wide-field photon correlation measurement using a large 500 x 500 single-photon avalanche diode array, the SwissSPAD3. We demonstrate the performance of this apparatus by acquiring wide-field photon correlation measurements of single-photon emitters and illustrate two applications of the attained quantum information: wide-field emitter counting and quantum-enabled super-resolution imaging (by a factor of root 2). The considerations and limitations of applying this technique in a practical context are discussed. Ultimately, the realization of massively multiplexed wide-field photon correlation measurements can accelerate quantum sensing protocols and quantum-enabled imaging techniques by orders of magnitude.

TI Survey on Computational Applications of Tensor-Network Simulations
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB Tensor networks are a popular and computationally efficient approach to simulate general quantum systems on classical computers and, in a broader sense, a framework for dealing with high-dimensional numerical problems. This paper presents a broad but not exhaustive literature review of state-of-the-art applications of tensor networks and related topics across many research domains, including: machine learning, mathematical optimization, materials science, quantum chemistry and quantum circuit simulation. This review aims to clarify which classes of relevant applications have been proposed for which class of tensor networks, as well as to highlight main application results and limitations compared with other classical or quantum simulation methods. We intend this review to be a high-level tour on tensor network applications that is easy to read by non-experts, so basic technical details of tensor networks are summarized.

TI Two-Photon Laser Excitation of Rb Rydberg Atoms in the Magneto-Optical
   Trap and Vapor Cell
SO PHOTONICS
AB We present our experimental results of two-photon laser excitation 5S1/2 -> 5P3/2 -> nS1/2 of Rb atoms to Rydberg nS1/2 states with a homemade 480 nm laser in the second excitation step. In an experiment with cold Rb atoms, we excited the 42S1/2 state and detected Rydberg atoms with a selective-field-ionization (SFI) detector that provides single-atom resolution. The resonance line shapes well agreed with numerical simulations in a three-level theoretical model. We also studied the multiatom spectra of Rydberg excitation of mesoscopic atom ensembles which are of interest to quantum information processing. In the experiment with hot Rb atoms, we first excited the 30S1/2 state and observed a narrow Rydberg EIT resonance. Its line shape also agreed well with theory. Then, we performed a similar experiment with the higher 41S1/2 state and observed the Autler-Townes splitting of the EIT resonance in the presence of a microwave field, which was in resonance with the microwave transition 41S -> 41P3/2. This allowed us to measure the average strength of the microwave field and, thus, demonstrate the operation of a Rydberg microwave sensor. We may conclude that the developed homemade laser at 480 nm substantially extends our capabilities for further experiments on quantum information and quantum sensing with Rydberg atoms.

TI Reversing Lindblad Dynamics via Continuous Petz Recovery Map
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB An important issue in developing quantum technology is that quantum states are so sensitive to noise. We propose a protocol that introduces reverse dynamics, in order to precisely control quantum systems against noise described by the Lindblad master equation. The reverse dynamics can be obtained by constructing the Petz recovery map in continuous time. By providing the exact form of the Hamiltonian and jump operators for the reverse dynamics, we explore the potential of utilizing the near-optimal recovery of the Petz map in controlling noisy quantum dynamics. While time-dependent dissipation engineering enables us to fully recover a single quantum trajectory, we also design a time-independent recovery protocol to protect encoded quantum information against decoherence. Our protocol can efficiently suppress only the noise part of dynamics thereby providing an effective unitary evolution of the quantum system.

TI Voltage noise thermometry in integrated circuits at millikelvin
   temperatures
SO JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYSICS
AB This paper demonstrates the use of voltage noise thermometry, with a cross-correlation technique, as a dissipation-free method of thermometry inside a CMOS integrated circuit (IC). We show that this technique exhibits broad agreement with the refrigerator temperature range from 300 mK to 8 K. Furthermore, it shows substantial agreement with both an independent in-IC thermometry technique and a simple thermal model as a function of power dissipation inside the IC. As the device under a test is a resistor, it is feasible to extend this technique by placing many resistors in an IC to monitor the local temperatures, without increasing IC design complexity. This could lead to better understanding of the thermal profile of ICs at cryogenic temperatures. This has its greatest potential application in quantum computing, where the temperature at the cold classical-quantum boundary must be carefully controlled to maintain qubit performance.

TI Experimental quantum state discrimination using the optimal fixed rate
   of inconclusive outcomes strategy
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB The problem of non-orthogonal state discrimination underlies crucial quantum information tasks, such as cryptography and computing protocols. Therefore, it is decisive to find optimal scenarios for discrimination among quantum states. We experimentally investigate the strategy for the optimal discrimination of two non-orthogonal states considering a fixed rate of inconclusive outcomes (FRIO). The main advantage of the FRIO strategy is to interpolate between unambiguous and minimum error discrimination by solely adjusting the rate of inconclusive outcomes. We present a versatile experimental scheme that performs the optimal FRIO measurement for any pair of generated non-orthogonal states with arbitrary a priori probabilities and any fixed rate of inconclusive outcomes. Considering different values of the free parameters in the FRIO protocol, we implement it upon qubit states encoded in the polarization mode of single photons generated in the spontaneous parametric down-conversion process. Moreover, we resort to a newfangled double-path Sagnac interferometer to perform a three-outcome non-projective measurement required for the discrimination task, showing excellent agreement with the theoretical prediction. This experiment provides a practical toolbox for a wide range of quantum state discrimination strategies using the FRIO scheme, which can significantly benefit quantum information applications and fundamental studies in quantum theory.

AB Natural language processing (NLP) problems are ubiquitous in classical computing, where they often require significant computational resources to infer sentence meanings. With the appearance of quantum computing hardware and simulators, it is worth developing methods to examine such problems on these platforms. In this manuscript we demonstrate the use of quantum computing models to perform NLP tasks, where we represent corpus meanings, and perform comparisons between sentences of a given structure. We develop a hybrid workflow for representing small and large scale corpus data sets to be encoded, processed, and decoded using a quantum circuit model. In addition, we provide our results showing the efficacy of the method, and release our developed toolkit as an open software suite.

TI Resonant quantum principal component analysis
SO SCIENCE ADVANCES
AB Principal component analysis (PCA) has been widely adopted to reduce the dimension of data while preserving the information. The quantum version of PCA (qPCA) can be used to analyze an unknown low-rank density matrix by rapidly revealing the principal components of it, i.e., the eigenvectors of the density matrix with the largest eigenvalues. However, because of the substantial resource requirement, its experimental implementation remains challenging. Here, we develop a resonant analysis algorithm with minimal resource for ancillary qubits, in which only one frequency-scanning probe qubit is required to extract the principal components. In the experiment, we demonstrate the distillation of the first principal component of a 4 x 4 density matrix, with an efficiency of 86.0% and a fidelity of 0.90. This work shows the speedup ability of quantum algorithm in dimension reduction of data and thus could be used as part of quantum artificial intelligence algorithms in the future.

TI Optimizing the Quantum Circuit for Solving Boolean Equations Based on
   Grover Search Algorithm
SO ELECTRONICS
AB The solution of nonlinear Boolean equations in a binary field plays a crucial part in cryptanalysis and computational mathematics. To speed up the process of solving Boolean equations is an urgent task that needs to be addressed. In this paper, we propose a method for solving Boolean equations based on the Grover algorithm combined with preprocessing using classical algorithms, optimizing the quantum circuit for solving the equations, and implementing the automatic generation of quantum circuits. The method first converted Boolean equations into Boolean expressions to construct the oracle in the Grover algorithm. The quantum circuit was emulated based on the IBM Qiskit framework and then simulated the Grover algorithm on this basis. Finally, the solution of the Boolean equation was implemented. The experimental results proved the feasibility of using the Grover algorithm to solve nonlinear Boolean equations in a binary field, and the correct answer was successfully found under the conditions that the search space was 2(21) and three G iterations were used. The method in this paper increases the solving scale and solving speed of Boolean equations and enlarges the application area of the Grover algorithm.

TI Diamond with Sp2-Sp3 composite phase
   for thermometry at Millikelvin temperatures
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Temperature is one of the seven fundamental physical quantities. The ability to measure temperatures approaching absolute zero has driven numerous advances in low-temperature physics and quantum physics. Currently, millikelvin temperatures and below are measured through the characterization of a certain thermal state of the system as there is no traditional thermometer capable of measuring temperatures at such low levels. In this study, we develop a kind of diamond with sp(2)-sp(3) composite phase to tackle this problem. The synthesized composite phase diamond (CPD) exhibits a negative temperature coefficient, providing an excellent fit across a broad temperature range, and reaching a temperature measurement limit of 1 mK. Additionally, the CPD demonstrates low magnetic field sensitivity and excellent thermal stability, and can be fabricated into probes down to 1 micron in diameter, making it a promising candidate for the manufacture of next-generation cryogenic temperature sensors. This development is significant for the low-temperature physics researches, and can help facilitate the transition of quantum computing, quantum simulation, and other related technologies from research to practical applications.

TI Quantum simulations of quantum electrodynamics in Coulomb gauge
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW D
AB In recent years, the quantum computing method has been used to address the sign problem in traditional Monte Carlo lattice gauge theory (LGT) simulations. We propose that the Coulomb gauge (CG) should be used in quantum simulations of LGT. Since the redundant degrees of freedom of gauge fields can be eliminated in CG, the Hamiltonian in CG does not need to be gauge invariant, allowing the gauge field to be discretized naively. Then the discretized gauge fields and fermion fields should be placed on momentum and position lattices, respectively. Under this scheme, the CG condition and Gauss's law can be conveniently preserved by solving for the polarization vectors from algebraic equations. Furthermore, we discuss the mapping of gauge fields to qubits and evaluate the associated qubit and gate cost of this framework. We point out that this formalism is efficient for simulating hadron scattering processes on future fault-tolerant quantum computers. Finally, we calculate the vacuum expectation value of the U(1) plaquette operator and the Wilson loop on a classical device to test the performance of our discretization scheme.

TI Filter Functions for Quantum Processes under Correlated Noise
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB Many qubit implementations are afflicted by correlated noise not captured by standard theoretical tools that are based on Markov approximations. While independent gate operations are a key concept for quantum computing, it is actually not possible to fully describe noisy gates locally in time if noise is correlated on times longer than their duration. To address this issue, we develop a method based on the filter function formalism to perturbatively compute quantum processes in the presence of correlated classical noise. We derive a composition rule for the filter function of a sequence of gates in terms of those of the individual gates. The joint filter function allows us to efficiently compute the quantum process of the whole sequence. Moreover, we show that correlation terms arise which capture the effects of the concatenation and, thus, yield insight into the effect of noise correlations on gate sequences. Our generalization of the filter function formalism enables both qualitative and quantitative studies of algorithms and state-of-the-art tools widely used for the experimental verification of gate fidelities like randomized benchmarking, even in the presence of noise correlations.

AB Quantum computing is currently experiencing rapid progress. Due to the complexity and continuous growth of knowledge in this field, it is essential to store information in a way that allows an easy access, analysis and navigation over reliable resources. Knowledge graphs (KGs) with machine-readable semantics offer a structural information representation and can enhance the capabilities of knowledge processing and information retrieval. In this paper, we extend the platform and ecosystem for quantum applications (PlanQK) for a KG. Specifically, we describe how the quantum computing knowledge, which is submitted on the platform by researchers and industry actors, is incorporated into the graph. Moreover, we outline the semantic search over the PlanQK KG.

TI Tomography of a Spatially Resolved Single-Atom Detector in the Presence
   of Shot-to-Shot Number Fluctuations
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB The tomography of single-particle-resolved detectors is of primary importance for characterizing particle correlations, with applications in quantum metrology, quantum simulation, and quantum computing. However, it is a nontrivial task in practice due to the uncertainties on the statistics of the state impinging on the detector and to the unavoidable presence of noise that affects the measurement but does not originate from the detector. In this work, we address this problem for a three-dimensional single-atom-resolved detector where shot-to-shot atom-number fluctuations are a central issue in performing a quantum detector tomography. We overcome this difficulty by exploiting the parallel measurement of the counting statistics in subvolumes of the detector, from which we evaluate the effect of shot-to-shot fluctuations and perform a local tomography of the detector. In addition, we illustrate the validity of our method from applying it to Gaussian quantum states with different number statistics. Finally, we show that the response of microchannel plate detectors is well described by using a binomial distribution with the detection efficiency as a single parameter.

TI Ultra-broadband quadrature squeezing with thin-film lithium niobate
   nanophotonics
SO OPTICS LETTERS
AB Squeezed light is a key quantum resource that enables quantum advantages for sensing, networking, and computing applications. The scalable generation and manipulation of squeezed light with integrated platforms are highly desired for the development of quantum technology with continuous variables. In this Letter, we demonstrate squeezed light generation with thin-film lithium niobate integrated photonics. Parametric down-conversion is realized with quasi-phase matching using ferroelectric domain engineering. With subwavelength mode confinement, efficient nonlinear processes can be observed with single-pass configuration. We measure 0.56 +/- 0.09 dB quadrature squeezing (similar to 2.6 dB inferred on-chip). The single-pass configuration further enables the generation of squeezed light with large spectral bandwidth up to 7 THz. This work represents a significant step towards the on-chip implementation of continuous-variable quantum information processing. (C) 2022 Optica Publishing Group

TI Optical Cycling Functionalization of Arenes
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY LETTERS
AB Closed, laser-induced optical transitions ("optical cycling transitions") of molecules can be used for state preparation and measurement in quantum information science and quantum sensing. Increasingly complex molecular species supporting optical cycling can provide new capabilities for quantum science, and it is not clear if there is a limit on their size or complexity. We explore Ca-O-L molecular constructs to support the optical cycling center, Ca, with ligands, L, being arenes. We find that L can be as large as coronene (i.e., CaOC24H11) without losing the diagonality of the Franck-Condon factor (FCF). Furthermore, L can be substituted with electron-withdrawing groups to improve the FCF. Larger L, beyond similar to 7 rings, can disrupt the diagonality of the FCF by closing the HOMO-LUMO ligand electronic state gap and reordering with the local states on the cycling center. Overall, we find that optical cycling can be retained for arenes, and we offer a principle for their design.

TI An improved two-threshold quantum segmentation algorithm for NEQR image
SO QUANTUM INFORMATION PROCESSING
AB The quantum image segmentation algorithm is to divide a quantum image into several parts, but most of the existing algorithms use more quantum resource(qubit) or cannot process the complex image. In this paper, an improved two-threshold quantum segmentation algorithm for NEQR image is proposed, which can segment the complex gray-scale image into a clear ternary image by using fewer qubits and can be scaled to use n thresholds for n + 1 segmentations. In addition, a feasible quantum comparator is designed to distinguish the gray-scale values with two thresholds, and then a scalable quantum circuit is designed to segment the NEQR image. For a 2(n)x2(n) image with q gray-scale levels, the quantum cost of our algorithm can be reduced to 60q-6, which is lower than other existing quantum algorithms and does not increase with the image's size increases. The experiment on IBM Q demonstrates that our algorithm can effectively segment the image.

TI Quantum Ranging with Gaussian Entanglement
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB It is well known that entanglement can benefit quantum information processing tasks. Quantum illumination, when first proposed, was surprising as the entanglement's benefit survived entanglement-breaking noise. Since then, many efforts have been devoted to study quantum sensing in noisy scenarios. The applicability of such schemes, however, is limited to a binary quantum hypothesis testing scenario. In terms of target detection, such schemes interrogate a single spatiotemporal resolution bin at a time, limiting the impact to radar detection. We resolve this binary-hypothesis limitation by proposing an entanglement-assisted quantum ranging protocol. By formulating a ranging task as a multiary hypothesis testing problem, we show that entanglement enables a 6-dB advantage in the error exponent against the optimal classical scheme. Moreover, the proposed ranging protocol can also be used to implement a pulse-position modulated entanglement-assisted communication protocol. Our ranging protocol reveals entanglement's potential in general quantum hypothesis testing tasks and paves the way toward a quantum-ranging radar with a provable quantum advantage.

TI Channel-based coherence of quantum states
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF QUANTUM INFORMATION
AB Quantum coherence is one of the most fundamental and striking features in quantum physics. Considered the standard coherence (SC), the partial coherence (PC) and the block coherence (BC) as variance of quantum states under some quantum channels (QCs) Phi, we propose the concept of channel-based coherence of quantum states, called Phi-coherence for short, which contains the SC, PC and BC, but does not contain the positive operator-valued measure (POVM)-based coherence. By our definition, a state p is said to be Phi-incoherent if it is a fixed point of a QC Phi, otherwise, it is said to be Phi-coherent. First, we find the set I(I) of all Phi-incoherent states for some given channels Phi and prove that the set I(I) forms a nonempty compact convex set for any channel (I). Second, we define Phi-incoherent operations (Phi-IOs) and prove that the set of all Phi-IOs is a nonempty convex set. We also establish some characterizations of a Phi-IO in terms of its Kraus operators. Lastly, we discuss the problem of quantifying Phi-coherence and prove some related properties.

TI A Novel QKD Approach to Enhance IIOT Privacy and Computational Knacks
SO SENSORS
AB The industry-based internet of things (IIoT) describes how IIoT devices enhance and extend their capabilities for production amenities, security, and efficacy. IIoT establishes an enterprise-to-enterprise setup that means industries have several factories and manufacturing units that are dependent on other sectors for their services and products. In this context, individual industries need to share their information with other external sectors in a shared environment which may not be secure. The capability to examine and inspect such large-scale information and perform analytical protection over the large volumes of personal and organizational information demands authentication and confidentiality so that the total data are not endangered after illegal access by hackers and other unauthorized persons. In parallel, these large volumes of confidential industrial data need to be processed within reasonable time for effective deliverables. Currently, there are many mathematical-based symmetric and asymmetric key cryptographic approaches and identity- and attribute-based public key cryptographic approaches that exist to address the abovementioned concerns and limitations such as computational overheads and taking more time for crucial generation as part of the encipherment and decipherment process for large-scale data privacy and security. In addition, the required key for the encipherment and decipherment process may be generated by a third party which may be compromised and lead to man-in-the-middle attacks, brute force attacks, etc. In parallel, there are some other quantum key distribution approaches available to produce keys for the encipherment and decipherment process without the need for a third party. However, there are still some attacks such as photon number splitting attacks and faked state attacks that may be possible with these existing QKD approaches. The primary motivation of our work is to address and avoid such abovementioned existing problems with better and optimal computational overhead for key generation, encipherment, and the decipherment process compared to the existing conventional models. To overcome the existing problems, we proposed a novel dynamic quantum key distribution (QKD) algorithm for critical public infrastructure, which will secure all cyber-physical systems as part of IIoT. In this paper, we used novel multi-state qubit representation to support enhanced dynamic, chaotic quantum key generation with high efficiency and low computational overhead. Our proposed QKD algorithm can create a chaotic set of qubits that act as a part of session-wise dynamic keys used to encipher the IIoT-based large scales of information for secure communication and distribution of sensitive information.

TI Hamiltonian simulation in the low-energy subspace
SO NPJ QUANTUM INFORMATION
AB We study the problem of simulating the dynamics of spin systems when the initial state is supported on a subspace of low energy of a Hamiltonian H. This is a central problem in physics with vast applications in many-body systems and beyond, where the interesting physics takes place in the low-energy sector. We analyze error bounds induced by product formulas that approximate the evolution operator and show that these bounds depend on an effective low-energy norm of H. We find improvements over the best previous complexities of product formulas that apply to the general case, and these improvements are more significant for long evolution times that scale with the system size and/or small approximation errors. To obtain these improvements, we prove exponentially decaying upper bounds on the leakage to high-energy subspaces due to the product formula. Our results provide a path to a systematic study of Hamiltonian simulation at low energies, which will be required to push quantum simulation closer to reality.

TI LHQNN: sequential and non-sequential layered hybrid quantum neural
   networks for image classification
SO QUANTUM MACHINE INTELLIGENCE
AB Quantum neural networks have emerged as a promising approach to solving complex problems across various domains, especially when integrated with classical methods. Several hybrid quantum-classical architectures have been developed to leverage the potential of quantum advantages for image classification tasks. The design of the quantum layer plays an important role in exploiting quantum properties such as superposition and entanglement. In this research, we propose hybrid quantum neural networks with multiple quantum layers, utilizing sequential circuits for enhanced feature representation through structured depth, and non-sequential circuits to reduce complexity and improve performance. Our experimental results demonstrate that stacking multiple layers in the quantum circuit enhances performance significantly. Furthermore, the results indicate that the optimal range of 6-10 qubits achieves the best trade-off between accuracy and computational efficiency. The results also show that amplitude embedding consistently outperformed angle embedding for image classification tasks. Notably, our proposed hybrid sequential model with amplitude embedding outperforms traditional convolutional neural networks on MNIST and Fashion-MNIST datasets, while requiring fewer parameters. These findings provide valuable insights for advancing quantum machine learning in real-world applications.

TI High Optical Access Cryogenic System for Rydberg Atom Arrays with a
   3000-Second Trap Lifetime
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB We present an optical tweezer array of Rb-87 atoms housed in an cryogenic environment that successfully combines a 4-K cryopumping surface, a <50-K cold box surrounding the atoms, and a room-temperature high-numerical-aperture objective lens. We demonstrate a 3000-s atom-trap lifetime, which enables us to optimize and measure losses at the 10(-4) level that arise during imaging and cooling, which are important to array rearrangement. We perform both ground-state qubit manipulation with an integrated microwave antenna and two-photon coherent Rydberg control, with the local electric field tuned to zero via integrated electrodes. We anticipate that the reduced blackbody radiation at the atoms from the cryogenic environment, combined with future electrical shielding, should decrease the rate of undesired transitions to nearby strongly interacting Rydberg states, which cause many-body loss and impede Rydberg gates. This low-vibration, high-optical-access cryogenic platform can be used with a wide range of optically trapped atomic or molecular species for applications in quantum computing, simulation, and metrology.

TI Arbitrary controlled-phase gate on fluxonium qubits using differential
   ac Stark shifts
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Large scale quantum computing motivates the invention of two-qubit gate schemes that not only maximize the gate fidelity but also draw minimal resources. In the case of superconducting qubits, the weak anharmonicity of transmons imposes profound constraints on the gate design, leading to increased complexity of devices and control protocols. Here we demonstrate a resource-efficient control over the interaction of strongly-anharmonic fluxonium qubits. Namely, applying an off-resonant drive to noncomputational transitions in a pair of capacitively-coupled fluxoniums induces a ZZ interaction due to unequal ac Stark shifts of the computational levels. With a continuous choice of frequency and amplitude, the drive can either cancel the static ZZ term or increase it by an order of magnitude to enable a controlled-phase (CP) gate with an arbitrary programmed phase shift. The cross-entropy benchmarking of these non-Clifford operations yields a sub 1% error, limited solely by incoherent processes. Our result demonstrates the advantages of strongly-anharmonic circuits over transmons in designing the next generation of quantum processors.

TI Error crafting in mixed quantum gate synthesis
SO NPJ QUANTUM INFORMATION
AB In fault-tolerant quantum computing, logical errors in unitary gate synthesis are comparable to the noise inherent in the gates themselves. While mixed synthesis can suppress such coherent errors quadratically, there is no clear understanding of its remnant error, which hinders us from designing a holistic and practical error countermeasure. In this work, we propose that the classical characterizability of synthesis error can be exploited; remnant errors can be crafted to satisfy desirable properties. We prove that we can craft the remnant error of arbitrary single-qubit unitaries to be Pauli and depolarizing errors, while the conventional twirling cannot be applied in general. For Pauli rotation gates, in particular, the crafting enables us to suppress the remnant error up to cubic order, which results in synthesis with a T-count of log2(1/epsilon)\documentclass[12pt]{minimal} \usepackage{amsmath} \usepackage{wasysym} \usepackage{amsfonts} \usepackage{amssymb} \usepackage{amsbsy} \usepackage{mathrsfs} \usepackage{upgreek} \setlength{\oddsidemargin}{-69pt} \begin{document}$${\log }_{2}(1/\varepsilon )$$\end{document} up to accuracy of epsilon = 10-9. Our work opens a novel avenue in quantum circuit design and architecture that orchestrates logical error countermeasures.

TI Spontaneous symmetry breaking in persistent currents of spinor
   polaritons
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB We predict the spontaneous symmetry breaking in a spinor Bose-Einstein condensate of exciton-polaritons (polaritons) caused by the coupling of its spin and orbital degrees of freedom. We study a polariton condensate trapped in a ring-shaped effective potential with a broken rotational symmetry. We propose a realistic scheme of generating controllable spinor azimuthal persistent currents of polaritons in the trap under the continuous wave optical pump. We propose a new type of half-quantum circulating states in a spinor system characterized by azimuthal currents in both circular polarizations and a vortex in only one of the polarizations. The spontaneous symmetry breaking in the spinor polariton condensate that consists in the switching from co-winding to opposite-winding currents in opposite spin states is revealed. It is characterized by the change of the average orbital angular momentum of the condensate from zero to non-zero values. The radial displacement of the pump spot and the polarization of the pump act as the control parameters. The considered system exhibits a fundamental similarity to a superconducting flux qubit, which makes it highly promising for applications in quantum computing.

TI Optimization driven quantum circuit reduction
SO NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB Implementing a quantum circuit on specific hardware with a reduced available gate set is often associated with a substantial increase in the length of the equivalent circuit. This process is also known as transpilation and due to decoherence, it is mandatory to keep quantum circuits as short as possible, without affecting functionality. In this work we propose three different transpilation approaches, based on a localized term-replacement scheme, to substantially reduce circuit lengths while preserving the unitary operation implemented by the circuit. The first variant is based on a stochastic search scheme, and the other variants are driven by a database retrieval scheme and a machine learning based decision support. We show that our proposed methods generate short quantum circuits for restricted gate sets, superior to the typical results obtained by using various qiskit and Berkley quantum synthesis toolkit optimization levels. Our method can be applied to different gate sets and scales well with an arbitrary number of qubits.

TI Enhancing scalability and accuracy of quantum poisson solver
SO QUANTUM INFORMATION PROCESSING
AB The Poisson equation has many applications across the broad areas of science and engineering. Most quantum algorithms for the Poisson solver presented so far either suffer from lack of accuracy and/or are limited to very small sizes of the problem and thus have no practical usage. In this regard, our previous work (Robson in 2022 IEEE International Conference on Quantum Computing and Engineering (QCE), 2022) showed a proof-of-concept demonstration in advancing quantum Poisson solver algorithm and validated preliminary results for a simple case of 3 x 3 \documentclass[12pt]{minimal} \usepackage{amsmath} \usepackage{wasysym} \usepackage{amsfonts} \usepackage{amssymb} \usepackage{amsbsy} \usepackage{mathrsfs} \usepackage{upgreek} \setlength{\oddsidemargin}{-69pt} \begin{document}$$3\times 3$$\end{document} problem. In this work, we delve into comprehensive research details, presenting the results on up to 15 x 15 \documentclass[12pt]{minimal} \usepackage{amsmath} \usepackage{wasysym} \usepackage{amsfonts} \usepackage{amssymb} \usepackage{amsbsy} \usepackage{mathrsfs} \usepackage{upgreek} \setlength{\oddsidemargin}{-69pt} \begin{document}$$15\times 15$$\end{document} problems that include step-by-step improvements in Poisson equation solutions, scaling performance, and experimental exploration. In particular, we demonstrate the implementation of eigenvalue amplification by a factor of up to 2 8 \documentclass[12pt]{minimal} \usepackage{amsmath} \usepackage{wasysym} \usepackage{amsfonts} \usepackage{amssymb} \usepackage{amsbsy} \usepackage{mathrsfs} \usepackage{upgreek} \setlength{\oddsidemargin}{-69pt} \begin{document}$$2<^>8$$\end{document} , achieving a significant improvement in the accuracy of our quantum Poisson solver and comparing that to the exact solution. Additionally, we present success probability results, highlighting the reliability of our quantum Poisson solver. Moreover, we explore the scaling performance of our algorithm against the circuit depth and width, demonstrating how our approach scales with larger problem sizes and thus further solidifies the practicality of easy adaptation of this algorithm in real-world applications. We also discuss a multilevel strategy for how this algorithm might be further improved to explore much larger problems with greater performance. Finally, through our experiments on the IBM quantum hardware, we conclude that though overall results on the existing NISQ hardware are dominated by the error in the CNOT gates, this work opens a path to realizing a multidimensional Poisson solver on near-term quantum hardware.

TI A COMSOL-Based Study of the Electrical Transport Properties of
   Al/α-Al2O3 Josephson Junctions
SO ADVANCED THEORY AND SIMULATIONS
AB Superconducting Josephson junctions, as integral components of quantum circuits, are vital for the production of high-quality, reproducible, and scalable quantum chips. The aluminum tunnel junctions is currently regarded as one of the most high-performing and well-established Josephson junctions for application in quantum devices. Nonetheless, the critical current of the junctions is highly sensitive to its thickness, which significantly influences both the tunneling effect and the electrical properties of the device. This study develops a numerical model of the 3D Al/alpha-Al2O3 Josephson junction employing finite element analysis. At the nanometer scale of the junction, the Cooper pairs tunneling probability of the atomically resolved electrostatic potential as well as the WKB-equivalent barrier height of the device is calculated. The results of the model reveal a channel effect that influences the critical current of the Josephson junctions, and it is found that the probability of particles tunneling varies with the thickness of the alumina film. The probability current density distribution near the junction for various barrier thicknesses is further investigated, simultaneously employing two tunneling probability calculation methods. Moreover, a 1D square potential barrier model is also established to elucidate the quantum tunneling effect, in which the amplitude of the wave function for tunneled particles diminishes as the thickness of the potential barrier increases.

TI Characterizing entanglement and measurement's uncertainty in neutrino
   oscillations
SO EUROPEAN PHYSICAL JOURNAL C
AB Since neutrino oscillations (NOs) show nonclassical features with the Leggett-Garg inequality and exhibit potential applications in quantum information processing and telecommunications, in order to further reveal quantum properties of the NO systems, we herein focus on investigating entanglement and entropic uncertainty relation in the context of three-flavor NOs. Specifically, we take advantage of three different types of entanglement measures to characterize quantum resources originating from NO systems, and examine the hierarchical relationship among them. Moreover, we analyze the experiment data from different neutrino sources including Daya Bay (0.5 and 1.6 km) and MINOS+ (735 km) collaborations in comparison with our theoretical results. We find that the dynamical evolution of both the entropic uncertainty and entanglement of system shows non-monotonicity, and the experimental results coincide with our theoretical prediction very well. Interestingly, it shows that neutrinos always maintain quantum properties during oscillation process. More importantly, we reveal that the variation of the uncertainty is almost anti-correlated with that of the entanglement of system. Therefore, the nature of entanglement and uncertainty in NOs can be explored in the practical experiment when the three-flavor neutrino states are treated as three-qubit ones, which might be useful for the potential NO-based applications on prospective quantum information processing.

TI Quantum extreme learning of molecular potential energy surfaces and
   force fields
SO MACHINE LEARNING-SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB Quantum machine learning algorithms are expected to play a pivotal role in quantum chemistry simulations in the immediate future. One such key application is the training of a quantum neural network to learn the potential energy surface and force field of molecular systems. We address this task by using the quantum extreme learning machine paradigm. This particular supervised learning routine allows for resource-efficient training, consisting of a simple linear regression performed on a classical computer. We have tested a setup that can be used to study molecules of any dimension and is optimized for immediate use on NISQ devices with a limited number of native gates. We have applied this setup to three case studies: lithium hydride, water, and formamide, carrying out both noiseless simulations and actual implementation on IBM quantum hardware. Compared to other supervised learning routines, the proposed setup requires minimal quantum resources, making it feasible for direct implementation on quantum platforms, while still achieving a high level of predictive accuracy compared to simulations. Our encouraging results pave the way towards the future application to more complex molecules, being the proposed setup scalable.

TI Quantum Neural Networks in Magnetic Resonance Imaging: Advancing
   Diagnostic Precision Through Emerging Computational Paradigms
SO COMPUTERS
AB Background: Quantum Neural Networks (QNNs) combine quantum computing and artificial intelligence to provide powerful solutions for high-dimensional data analysis. In magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), they address the challenges of advanced imaging sequences and data complexity, enabling faster optimization, enhanced feature extraction, and real-time clinical applications. Methods: A literature review using Scopus, PubMed, IEEE Xplore, ACM Digital Library and arXiv identified 84 studies on QNNs in MRI. After filtering for peer-reviewed original research, 20 studies were analyzed. Key parameters such as datasets, architectures, hardware, tasks, and performance metrics were summarized to highlight trends and gaps. Results: The analysis identified datasets supporting tasks like tumor classification, segmentation, and disease prediction. Architectures included hybrid models (e.g., ResNet34 with quantum circuits) and novel approaches (e.g., Quantum Chebyshev Polynomials). Hardware ranged from high-performance GPUs to quantum-specific devices. Performance varied, with accuracy up to 99.5% in some configurations but lower results for complex or limited datasets. Conclusions: The findings provide the first glimpse into the potential of QNNs in MRI, demonstrating accuracy and specificity in diagnostic tasks and biomarker detection. However, challenges such as dataset variability, limited quantum hardware access, and reliance on simulators remain. Future research should focus on scalable quantum hardware, standardized datasets, and optimized architectures to support clinical applications and precision medicine.

TI A single-phonon directional coupler
SO OPTICA QUANTUM
AB Integrated photonics has revolutionized fields such as telecommunications, quantum optics, and metrology by enabling compact, scalable circuits through highly confined optical modes. Within the field of quantum acoustics, phonons have emerged as a compelling alternative, offering advantages such as lower energy, smaller mode volume, and low propagation speeds, which make them ideal for interfacing diverse quantum systems. Developing integrated phononic circuits is thus essential for unlocking the full potential of quantum acoustics and advancing technologies such as quantum computing and hybrid systems. In this work, we demonstrate the first 4-port directional coupler for quantum mechanical excitations-a key building block for phononic circuits. By tuning the coupling region length, we achieve phononic beam splitters with controllable splitting ratios. We validate quantum-level performance by sending a single-phonon Fock state through the device. This work represents a foundational advance toward scalable, integrated phononic platforms for both classical and quantum applications.

TI An Operation Guide of Si-MOS Quantum Dots for Spin Qubits
SO NANOMATERIALS
AB In the last 20 years, silicon quantum dots have received considerable attention from academic and industrial communities for research on readout, manipulation, storage, near-neighbor and long-range coupling of spin qubits. In this paper, we introduce how to realize a single spin qubit from Si-MOS quantum dots. First, we introduce the structure of a typical Si-MOS quantum dot and the experimental setup. Then, we show the basic properties of the quantum dot, including charge stability diagram, orbital state, valley state, lever arm, electron temperature, tunneling rate and spin lifetime. After that, we introduce the two most commonly used methods for spin-to-charge conversion, i.e., Elzerman readout and Pauli spin blockade readout. Finally, we discuss the details of how to find the resonance frequency of spin qubits and show the result of coherent manipulation, i.e., Rabi oscillation. The above processes constitute an operation guide for helping the followers enter the field of spin qubits in Si-MOS quantum dots.

TI Experimentally characterizing multiparticle entanglement based on
   measuring quantum Fisher information
SO ACTA PHYSICA SINICA
AB Quantum Fisher information plays a vital role in the field of quantum metrology and quantum information, because it not only quantifies the ultimate precision bound of parameter estimation but also provides criteria for entanglement detection. Nevertheless, experimentally extracting quantum Fisher information is intractable. Quantum state tomography is a typical approach to obtaining the complete information about a quantum system and extract quantum Fisher information. However it becomes infeasible for large-scale quantum systems owing to the exponentially growing complexity. In this paper, we present a general relationship between quantum Fisher information and the overlap of quantum states. Specifically, we show that for pure states, the quantum Fisher information can be exactly extracted from the overlap, whereas for mixed states, only the lower bound can be obtained. We also develop a protocol for measuring the overlap of quantum states, which only requires one additional auxiliary qubit and a single measurement for pure state. Our protocol is more efficient and scalable than previous approaches because it requires less time and fewer measurements. We use this protocol to characterize the multiparticle entanglement in a three-body interaction system undergoing adiabatic quantum phase transition, and experimentally demonstrate its feasibility for the first time in a nuclear magnetic resonance quantum system. We conduct our experiment on a 4-qubit nuclear magnetic resonance quantum simulator, three of which are used to simulate the quantum phase transition in a three-body interaction system, and the remaining one is used as the auxiliary qubit to detect the overlap of the quantum state. We use gradient ascent pulse engineering pulses to implement the process of evolution. By measuring the auxiliary qubit, the experimental results of quantum Fisher information are obtained and match well with the theoretical predictions, thus successfully characterizing the multiparticle entanglement in a practical quantum system. We further confirm our results by performing quantum state tomography on some quantum states in the adiabatic process. The experimentally reconstructed quantum states are close to the corresponding instantaneous ground states.

TI Efficient parallelization of quantum basis state shift
SO QUANTUM SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB Basis state shift is central to many quantum algorithms, most notably the quantum walk. Efficient implementations are of major importance for achieving a quantum speedup for computational applications. We optimize the state shift algorithm by incorporating the shift in different directions in parallel. This provides a significant reduction in the depth of the quantum circuit in comparison to the currently known methods, giving a linear scaling in the number of gates versus working qubits in contrast to the quadratic scaling of the state-of-the-art method based on the quantum Fourier transform. For a one-dimensional array of size 2( n) for n > 4, we derive the total number of 15n+74 two-qubit CX gates in the parallel circuit, using a total of 2(n)-2 qubits including an ancilla register for the decomposition of multi-controlled gates. We focus on the one-dimensional and periodic shift, but note that the method can be extended to more complex cases.

TI State transformations within entanglement classes containing
   permutation-symmetric states
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB The study of state transformations under local operations and classical communication (LOCC) plays a crucial role in entanglement theory. While this has been long ago characterized for pure bipartite states, the situation is drastically different for systems of more parties: generic pure qudit states cannot be obtained from nor transformed to any state (i.e., they are isolated), which contains a different amount of entanglement. We consider here the question of LOCC convertibility for permutation-symmetric pure states of an arbitrary number of parties and local dimension, a class of clear interest both for physical and mathematical reasons and for which the aforementioned result does not apply given that it is a zero-measure subset in the state space. While it turns out that generic n-qubit symmetric states are also isolated, we consider particular families for which we can determine to be, on the contrary, endowed with a rich local stabilizer, a necessary requirement for LOCC convertibility to be possible. This allows us to identify classes in which LOCC transformations among permutation-symmetric states are possible. Notwithstanding, we provide several results that indicate severe obstructions to LOCC convertibility in general even within these highly symmetrical classes. In the course of the study of LOCC transformations, we also characterize the local symmetries of symmetric states.

TI On the similarity of bandwidth-tuned quantum kernels and classical
   kernels
SO QUANTUM SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB Quantum kernels (QKs) are widely used in quantum machine learning applications; yet, their potential to surpass classical machine learning methods on classical datasets remains uncertain. This limitation can be attributed to the exponential concentration phenomenon, which can impair generalization. A common strategy to alleviate this is bandwidth tuning, which involves rescaling data points in the quantum model to improve generalization. In this work, we numerically demonstrate that optimal bandwidth tuning results in QKs that closely resemble radial basis function (RBF) kernels, leading to a lack of quantum advantage over classical methods. Moreover, we reveal that the size of optimal bandwidth tuning parameters further simplifies QKs, causing them to behave like polynomial kernels, corresponding to a low-order Taylor approximation of a RBF kernel. We thoroughly investigate this for fidelity quantum kernels and projected quantum kernels using various data encoding circuits across several classification datasets. We provide numerical evidence and derive a simple analytical model that elucidates how bandwidth tuning influences key quantities in classification tasks. Overall, our findings shed light on the mechanisms that render QK methods classically tractable.

TI Slow thermalization and subdiffusion in U(1) conserving Floquet random
   circuits
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
AB Random quantum circuits are paradigmatic models of minimally structured and analytically tractable chaotic dynamics. We study a family of Floquet unitary circuits with Haar random U(1) charge conserving dynamics; the minimal such model has nearest-neighbor gates acting on spin-1/2 qubits, and a single layer of even/odd gates repeated periodically in time. We find that this minimal model is not robustly thermalizing at numerically accessible system sizes, and displays slow subdiffusive dynamics for long times. We map out the thermalization dynamics in a broader parameter space of charge conserving circuits, and understand the origin of the slow dynamics in terms of proximate localized and integrable regimes in parameter space. In contrast, we find that small extensions to the minimal model are sufficient to achieve robust thermalization; these include (i) increasing the interaction range to three-site gates, (ii) increasing the local Hilbert space dimension by appending an additional unconstrained qubit to the conserved charge on each site, or (iii) using a larger Floquet period comprised of two independent layers of gates. Our results should inform future studies of charge conserving circuits, which are relevant for a wide range of topical theoretical questions.

TI Dual Discriminators Quantum Generation Adversarial Network Based on
   Quantum Convolutional Neural Network
SO ADVANCED QUANTUM TECHNOLOGIES
AB As a crucial component in quantum machine learning, quantum generative adversarial networks play a significant role in generating discrete distributions. However, due to issues such as the vanishing gradient and mode collapse, the results generated by quantum generative adversarial models are of suboptimal quality sometimes. Given the robust image feature extraction capabilities of quantum convolutional neural networks, a hybrid quantum convolutional neural network model is incorporated into the quantum generative adversarial network as a discriminator. Different from the traditional multi-layer linear structure, this discriminator adopts a parallel structure. This parallel structure can analyze both the local and the global features of an image simultaneously. It can promptly detect the defects in the global distribution of generated data, prompting the generator to explore more data patterns and avoid falling into mode collapse. The feasibility of this solution is verified through generation experiments on the handwritten dataset, Fashion-MNIST dataset, and CIFAR-100 dataset. The experimental results show that the FID (Fr & eacute;chet Inception Distance) scores of the generated results on these three datasets reach 14, 20, and 17 respectively, fully demonstrating the performance of this image generation algorithm.

TI Exciton Controlled-NOT Gate Using Coupled Quantum Dots in Carbon
   Nanotube
SO ACS PHOTONICS
AB A four-level system is a prerequisite for the controlled-NOT (CNOT) gate and is realized with excitons confined in the coupled quantum dots (QDs). The coupled QDs are fabricated by chemically bonding the collagen model peptides to a single-walled carbon nanotube. An interdot exciton-exciton interaction and an exciton four-level system based on it are confirmed through photoluminescence measurements. Rabi oscillations of the exciton populations are observed, which allow the manipulations of the exciton four-level system with designed laser-pulse sequences. The tests on whether the exciton four-level system operates as a CNOT gate are conducted, and the quantum process fidelity is estimated to be approximately 0.7-0.8. The SWAP operation is also demonstrated by employing the CNOT gate three times.

TI Efficient Image Encryption via 2D Logistic Chaos Mapping: Strengthening
   Security with Pixel-Level Dynamics
SO INTERNATIONAL ARAB JOURNAL OF INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY
AB This study presents an innovative image encryption algorithm anchored on the two-dimensional Logistic chaotic system, designed to address the limitations of traditional methods in terms of speed and security. The algorithm employs pixel shifting and scrambling, coupled with a segmented grayscale value substitution, to achieve a high level of security with strong key sensitivity and robust resistance to both differential and statistical attacks. Experimental validation demonstrates its superiority with fast encryption speeds, as evidenced by an encryption time of 0.2136 seconds for a 256x256 color image, and an entropy close to its ideal value, indicating excellent randomness. This method also exhibits high performance in resisting differential attacks, with Number of Pixels Change Rate (NPCR) and the Unified Average Changing Intensity (UACI) values nearing their optimal expected values. The integration of Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) is suggested for future work to enhance security against quantum computing threats, solidifying the algorithm's potential as a leading solution for the image encryption. .

TI Gate-based quantum neurons in hybrid neural networks
SO NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB Quantum computing is conceived as a promising and powerful next-generation platform for information processing and it has been shown that it could bring significant accelerations to certain tasks, compared to its classical counterparts. With recent advances in noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices, we can process classical data from real-world problems using hybrid quantum systems. In this work, we investigate the critical problem of designing a gate-based hybrid quantum neuron under NISQ constraints to enable the construction of scalable hybrid quantum deep neural networks (HQDNNs). We explore and characterize diverse quantum circuits for hybrid quantum neurons and discuss related critical components of HQDNNs. We also utilize a new schema to infer multiple predictions from a single hybrid neuron. We further compose a highly customizable platform for simulating HQDNNs via Qiskit and test them on diverse classification problems including the iris and the wheat seed datasets. The results show that even HQDNNs with the simplest neurons could lead to superior performance on these tasks. Finally, we show that the HQDNNs are robust to certain levels of noise, making them preferred on NISQ devices. Our work provides a comprehensive investigation of building scalable near-term gate-based HQDNNs and paves the way for future studies of quantum deep learning via both simulations on classical computers and experiments on accessible NISQ devices.

TI Efficient deterministic preparation of quantum states using decision
   diagrams
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Loading classical data into quantum registers is one of the most important primitives of quantum computing. While the complexity of preparing a generic quantum state is exponential in the number of qubits, in many practical tasks the state to prepare has a certain structure that allows for faster preparation. In this paper, we consider quantum states that can be efficiently represented by (reduced) decision diagrams, a versatile data structure for the representation and analysis of Boolean functions. We design an algorithm that utilizes the structure of decision diagrams to prepare their associated quantum states. Our algorithm has a circuit complexity that is linear in the number of paths in the decision diagram. Numerical experiments show that our algorithm reduces the circuit complexity by up to 31.85% compared to the state-of-the-art algorithm, when preparing generic n-qubit states with n(3) nonzero amplitudes. Additionally, for states with sparse decision diagrams, including the initial state of the quantum Byzantine agreement protocol, our algorithm reduces the number of controlled-NOTs by 86.61-99.9%.

TI Integrating quantum materials into superconducting qubits
SO MATERIALS FOR QUANTUM TECHNOLOGY
AB In this perspective article, we review the current state of research on integrating quantum materials (QMs) into superconducting quantum devices. We begin with the role of QMs as weak links in Josephson junctions, enabling gate- and flux-tunable transmons. We then explore their application in more complex superconducting circuits, such as gate-tunable fluxonium qubits, or gatemonium, which provide additional control over qubit parameters. We also discuss QM-based vertical junctions and their potential for creating merged-element transmons. Further, we highlight QMs' role in topological superconducting circuits, where they facilitate the study of Majorana zero modes through signatures such as 4 pi-periodic supercurrents. Additionally, we review the integration of QMs into 3D cavity architectures and discuss how they differ from their 2D counterparts. Beyond weak links, we examine the use of 2D superconducting and insulating materials, such as NbSe2 and hBN, in parallel-plate capacitors, offering a compact alternative to conventional large-footprint transmon capacitors. Finally, we outline the current challenges and future directions for exploration.

TI Deterministic all-optical quantum state sharing
SO ADVANCED PHOTONICS
AB Quantum state sharing, an important protocol in quantum information, can enable secure state distribution and reconstruction when part of the information is lost. In (k, n) threshold quantum state sharing, the secret state is encoded into n shares and then distributed to n players. The secret state can be reconstructed by any k players (k > n / 2), while the rest of the players get nothing. In the continuous variable regime, the implementation of quantum state sharing needs the feedforward technique, which involves optic-electro and electro-optic conversions. These conversions limit the bandwidth of the quantum state sharing. Here, to avoid the optic-electro and electro-optic conversions, we experimentally demonstrate (2, 3) threshold deterministic all-optical quantum state sharing. A low-noise phase-insensitive amplifier based on the four-wave mixing process is utilized to replace the feedforward technique. We experimentally demonstrate that any two of three players can cooperate to implement the reconstruction of the secret state, while the rest of the players cannot get any information. Our results provide an all-optical platform to implement arbitrary (k, n) threshold deterministic all-optical quantum state sharing and pave the way to construct the all-optical broadband quantum network.

TI Effect of barren plateaus on gradient-free optimization
SO QUANTUM
AB Barren plateau landscapes correspond to gradients that vanish exponentially in the number of qubits. Such landscapes have been demonstrated for variational quantum algorithms and quantum neural networks with deep circuits, global cost functions, large entanglement, or hardware noise. For obvious reasons, it is expected that gradient-based optimizers will be significantly affected by barren plateaus. However, whether or not gradient-free optimizers are impacted is a topic of debate, with some arguing that gradient-free approaches are unaffected by barren plateaus. Here we show that, indeed, gradient-free optimizers do not solve the barren plateau problem. Our main result proves that cost function differences, which are the basis for making decisions in a gradient-free optimization, are exponentially suppressed in a barren plateau. Hence, without exponential precision, gradient-free optimizers will not make progress in the optimization. We numerically confirm this by training a parameterized quantum circuit in a barren plateau landscape with several gradient free optimizers (Nelder-Mead, Powell, and COBYLA algorithms), and show that the number of shots required in the optimization grows exponentially with the number of qubits. These results provide new insight into the training landscapes of quantum neural networks and will inform the development of strategies to mitigate or avoid barren plateaus.

TI Federated quantum-inspired anomaly detection using collaborative neural
   clients
SO FRONTIERS IN ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE
AB Introduction The fusion of deep-learning-based and federated methods has brought great progress in anomaly detection. Yet the systems of today still suffer from certain glaring issues. First, aggregation of data on a central entity poses dangerous privacy hazards. Second, such models could not scale and adapt to heterogeneous and distributed environments. Lastly, fine consideration has hardly been given to quantum-inspired computational paradigms that may promise to improve both speed and security of such systems. To fill in these gaps, this research proposes a completely novel quantum-inspired federated learning approach to anomaly detection that keeps data private and allows for further implementations of quantum computing applications.Methods The proposed system works on a client-server architecture comprising multiple clients, which either run training of local feedforward neural networks on different private subsets of their data or choose to not participate during an iteration. Clients never pass raw data to the server but instead alternate by sending the server the parameters of the trained model. The server aggregates these local updates by the FedAvg algorithm and produces the global model. The present implementation focuses mainly on utilizing classical deep learning; however, the architecture is made flexible enough to intertwine smoothly with quantum machine-learning paradigms in the future, thus enabling quantum technological enhancement down the road without requiring the entire system to be rebuilt.Results The framework could produce up to 79% of anomalous detection accuracy. The system had effective learning across distributed clients whilst ensuring that no piece of private data was being shared or spilled (exposed) between clients. These results ensured that the framework maintained its performance while keeping its privacy intact, a very crucial consideration on which to ever really deploy such in sensitive areas.Discussion The approach allows privacy-preserving anomaly detection across multiple domains and serves as a framework for enlarging and scaling the system. Being quantum-inspired compatible allows for future-proofing and further expediting and enhancing security. The system, having the capability to securely work in a distributed manner, can, thus, be utilized in critical information domains like cybersecurity, finance, and healthcare, where privacy of data is deemed extremely important. This work, thereby, offers a useful federated learning approach towards anomaly detection while going a step further towards the incorporation of quantum computing into secure, distributed AI systems.

TI Quantum-Enhanced Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient for Voltage
   Regulation in Smart Grids With High Electromobility Penetration
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB The increasing adoption of electric vehicles and integration of distributed renewable energy resources are reshaping power distribution systems. Although these developments promote decarbonization and enhance energy accessibility, they also present challenges related to nodal voltage regulation and power flow management. Quantum-enhanced learning can address modern power system control challenges. We introduce a Quantum-Enhanced Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient algorithm (Q-DDPG) for voltage regulation in smart grid networks with high electric vehicle integration. By incorporating parameterized quantum circuits into the actor network, our approach efficiently searches for high-dimensional control policies using entanglement and superposition. We model the smart grid as a continuous Markov decision process, with nodal voltages, electric vehicle demands, and renewable fluctuations as states, and voltage setpoints and reactive power dispatch as actions. Simulations on a 33-bus feeder with varying electric vehicle penetration levels show that Q-DDPG achieves faster convergence, maintains voltage profiles within +/- 1% of nominal values, and significantly reduces voltage deviation compared to standard classical reinforcement learning models. Robustness analysis demonstrates that quantum-enhanced exploration yields more resilient control strategies, suggesting that quantum-inspired reinforcement learning can significantly enhance voltage stability and power quality in smart grids.

TI A quantum dot crossbar with sublinear scaling of interconnects at
   cryogenic temperature
SO NPJ QUANTUM INFORMATION
AB We demonstrate a 36 x 36 gate electrode crossbar that supports 648 narrow-channel field effect transistors (FET) for gate-defined quantum dots, with a quadratic increase in quantum dot count upon a linear increase in control lines. The crossbar is fabricated on an industrial Si-28-MOS stack and shows 100% FET yield at cryogenic temperature. We observe a decreasing threshold voltage for wider channel devices and obtain a normal distribution of pinch-off voltages for nominally identical tunnel barriers probed over 1296 gate crossings. Macroscopically across the crossbar, we measure an average pinch-off of 1.17 V with a standard deviation of 46.8 mV, while local differences within each unit cell indicate a standard deviation of 23.1 mV. These disorder potential landscape variations translate to 1.2 and 0.6 times the measured quantum dot charging energy, respectively. Such metrics provide means for material and device optimization and serve as guidelines in the design of large-scale architectures for fault-tolerant semiconductor-based quantum computing.

TI Quantum Simulating Continuum Field Theories with Large-Spin Lattice
   Models
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB Simulating the real-time dynamics of quantum field theories (QFTs) is one of the most promising applications of quantum simulators. Regularizing a bosonic QFT for quantum simulation purposes typically involves a truncation in Hilbert space in addition to a discretization of space. Here, we discuss how to perform such a regularization of scalar QFTs by explicitly constructing suitable many-body lattice Hamiltonians using multilevel or qudit systems and show that this enables quantitative predictions in the continuum limit by extrapolating results obtained for large-spin models. With extensive matrix-productstate simulations, we numerically demonstrate the sequence of extrapolations that leads to quantitative agreement of observables for the integrable sine-Gordon (sG) QFT. We further show how to prepare static and moving-soliton excitations and we analyze their scattering dynamics in the continuum limit, in agreement with a semiclassical model and with quantitative analytical predictions. Finally, we illustrate how a nonintegrable perturbation of the sG model gives rise to dynamics reminiscent of string breaking and plasma oscillations in gauge theories. Our methods are directly applicable in state-of-the-art analog quantum simulators, opening the door to quantitatively investigating a wide variety of scalar-field theories and tackling long-standing questions in nonequilibrium QFT such as the fate of the false vacuum.

TI Quantum architecture search via truly proximal policy optimization
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB Quantum Architecture Search (QAS) is a process of voluntarily designing quantum circuit architectures using intelligent algorithms. Recently, Kuo et al. (Quantum architecture search via deepreinforcement learning. arXiv preprint arXiv:2104.07715, 2021) proposed a deep reinforcement learning-based QAS (QAS-PPO) method, which used the Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithm to automatically generate the quantum circuit without any expert knowledge in physics. However, QAS-PPO can neither strictly limit the probability ratio between old and new policies nor enforce well-defined trust domain constraints, resulting in poor performance. In this paper, we present a new deep reinforcement learning-based QAS method, called Trust Region-based PPO with Rollback for QAS (QAS-TR-PPO-RB), to automatically build the quantum gates sequence from the density matrix only. Specifically, inspired by the research work of Wang, we employ an improved clipping function to implement the rollback behavior to limit the probability ratio between the new strategy and the old strategy. In addition, we use the triggering condition of the clipping based on the trust domain to optimize the policy by restricting the policy within the trust domain, which leads to guaranteed monotone improvement. Experiments on several multi-qubit circuits demonstrate that our presented method achieves better policy performance and lower algorithm running time than the original deep reinforcement learning-based QAS method.

TI Grover Adaptive Search With Spin Variables
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON QUANTUM ENGINEERING
AB This article presents a novel approach to Grover adaptive search (GAS) for a combinatorial optimization problem whose objective function involves spin variables. While the GAS algorithm with a conventional design of a quantum dictionary subroutine handles a problem associated with an objective function with binary variables {0, 1}, we reformulate the problem using spin variables {+1, -1} to simplify the algorithm. Specifically, we introduce a novel quantum dictionary subroutine that is designed for this spin-based formulation. A key benefit of this approach is the substantial reduction in the number of CNOT gates required to construct the quantum circuit. We theoretically demonstrate, for certain problems, that our proposed approach can reduce the gate complexity from an exponential order to a polynomial order, compared to the conventional binary-based approach. This improvement has the potential to enhance the scalability and efficiency of GAS, particularly in larger quantum computations.

TI Quantum amplification of boson-mediated interactions
SO NATURE PHYSICS
AB Strong and precisely controlled interactions between quantum objects are essential for quantum information processing(1,2), simulation(3) and sensing(4,5), and for the formation of exotic quantum matter(6). A well-established paradigm for coupling otherwise weakly interacting quantum objects is to use auxiliary bosonic quantum excitations to mediate the interactions. Important examples include photon-mediated interactions between atoms(7), superconducting qubits(8), and colour centres in diamond(9), and phonon-mediated interactions between trapped ions(10-12) and between optical and microwave photons(13). Boson-mediated interactions can, in principle, be amplified through parametric driving of the boson channel; the drive need not couple directly to the interacting quantum objects. This technique has been proposed for a variety of quantum platforms(14-24), but has not, so far, been realized in the laboratory. Here we experimentally demonstrate the amplification of a boson-mediated interaction between two trapped-ion qubits by parametric modulation of the trapping potential(21). The amplification provides up to a 3.25-fold increase in the interaction strength, validated by measuring the speed-up of two-qubit entangling gates. This amplification technique can be used in any quantum platform where parametric modulation of the boson channel is possible, enabling exploration of new parameter regimes and enhanced quantum information processing.

TI No Preferred Reference Frame at the Foundation of Quantum Mechanics
SO ENTROPY
AB Quantum information theorists have created axiomatic reconstructions of quantum mechanics (QM) that are very successful at identifying precisely what distinguishes quantum probability theory from classical and more general probability theories in terms of information-theoretic principles. Herein, we show how one such principle, Information Invariance and Continuity, at the foundation of those axiomatic reconstructions, maps to "no preferred reference frame" (NPRF, aka "the relativity principle") as it pertains to the invariant measurement of Planck's constant h for Stern-Gerlach (SG) spin measurements. This is in exact analogy to the relativity principle as it pertains to the invariant measurement of the speed of light c at the foundation of special relativity (SR). Essentially, quantum information theorists have extended Einstein's use of NPRF from the boost invariance of measurements of c to include the SO(3) invariance of measurements of h between different reference frames of mutually complementary spin measurements via the principle of Information Invariance and Continuity. Consequently, the "mystery" of the Bell states is understood to result from conservation per Information Invariance and Continuity between different reference frames of mutually complementary qubit measurements, and this maps to conservation per NPRF in spacetime. If one falsely conflates the relativity principle with the classical theory of SR, then it may seem impossible that the relativity principle resides at the foundation of non-relativisitic QM. In fact, there is nothing inherently classical or quantum about NPRF. Thus, the axiomatic reconstructions of QM have succeeded in producing a principle account of QM that reveals as much about Nature as the postulates of SR.

TI Lyapunov-control-inspired strategies for quantum combinatorial
   optimization
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB The prospect of using quantum computers to solve combinatorial optimization problems via the quantum approximate optimization algorithm (QAOA) has attracted considerable interest in recent years. However, a key limitation associated with QAOA is the need to classically optimize over a set of quantum circuit parameters. This classical optimization can have significant associated costs and challenges. Here we provide an expanded description of Lyapunov control-inspired strategies for quantum optimization, as presented in [Magann et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 129, 250502 (2022)], that do not require any classical optimization effort. Instead, these strategies utilize feedback from qubit measurements to assign values to the quantum circuit parameters in a deterministic manner, such that the combinatorial optimization problem solution improves monotonically with the quantum circuit depth. Numerical analyses are presented that investigate the utility of these strategies towards MaxCut on weighted and unweighted 3-regular graphs, both in ideal implementations and in the presence of measurement noise. We also discuss how how these strategies compare with QAOA and how they may be used to seed QAOA optimizations in order to improve performance for near-term applications, and we explore connections to quantum annealing.

TI Polarization-encoded photonic quantum-to-quantum Bernoulli factory based
   on a quantum dot source
SO SCIENCE ADVANCES
AB A Bernoulli factory is a randomness manipulation routine that takes as input a Bernoulli random variable, outputting another Bernoulli variable whose bias is a function of the input bias. Recently proposed quantum-to-quantum Bernoulli factory schemes encode both input and output variables in qubit amplitudes. This primitive could be used as a subroutine for more complex quantum algorithms involving Bayesian inference and Monte Carlo methods. Here, we report an experimental implementation of a polarization-encoded photonic quantum-to-quantum Bernoulli factory. We present and test three interferometric setups implementing the basic operations of an algebraic field (inversion, multiplication, and addition), which, chained together, allow for the implementation of a generic quantum-to-quantum Bernoulli factory. These in-bulk schemes are validated using a quantum dot-based single-photon source featuring high brightness and indistinguishability, paired with a time-to-spatial demultiplexing setup to prepare input resources of up to three single-photon states.

TI Topologically protected vector edge states and polarization beam
   splitter by all-dielectric valley photonic crystal slabs
SO NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB The polarization beam splitter (PBS) is the essential optical component, which is widely used in various optical instruments. Its robustness against perturbation is very necessary to all-optical classical and quantum networks. Here, we report the design of topologically protected vector edge states (dual-polarization with transverse electric and transverse magnetic modes) and PBS based on all-dielectric topological valley photonic crystal slabs. The topologically protected vector edge states have been realized for the first time using germanium photonic crystal slab with silica substrate. Based on such edge states, the topologically protected PBS has been designed and its robust property has been demonstrated by exact numerical simulations. Our proposed PBS is expected to be widespread applications for photonic integrated circuits and quantum information processing.

TI Quantum Readout of Imperfect Classical Data
SO SENSORS
AB The encoding of classical data in a physical support can be done up to some level of accuracy due to errors and the imperfection of the writing process. Moreover, some degradation of the stored data can happen over time because of physical or chemical instability of the system. Any readout strategy should take into account this natural degree of uncertainty and minimize its effect. An example are optical digital memories, where the information is encoded in two values of reflectance of a collection of cells. Quantum reading using entanglement, has been shown to enhances the readout of an ideal optical memory, where the two level are perfectly characterized. In this work, we analyse the case of imperfect construction of the memory and propose an optimized quantum sensing protocol to maximize the readout accuracy in presence of imprecise writing. The proposed strategy is feasible with current technology and is relatively robust to detection and optical losses. Beside optical memories, this work have implications for identification of pattern in biological system, in spectrophotometry, and whenever the information can be extracted from a transmission/reflection optical measurement.

TI High-speed imaging of spatiotemporal correlations in Hong-Ou-Mandel
   interference
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB The Hong-Ou-Mandel interference effect lies at the heart of many emerging quantum technologies whose performance can be significantly enhanced with increasing numbers of entangled modes one could measure and thus utilize. Photon pairs generated through the process of spontaneous parametric down conversion are known to be entangled in a vast number of modes in the various degrees of freedom (DOF) the photons possess such as time, energy, and momentum, etc. Due to limitations in detection technology and techniques, often only one such DOFs can be effectively measured at a time, resulting in much lost potential. Here, we experimentally demonstrate, with the aid of a time tagging camera, high speed measurement and characterization of two-photon interference. With a data acquisition time of only a few seconds, we observe a bi-photon interference and coalescence visibility of similar to 64% with potentially up to similar to 2 x 10(3) spatial modes. These results open up a route for practical applications of using the high dimensionality of spatiotemporal DOF in two-photon interference, and in particular, for quantum sensing and communication.

TI Isotope engineering for spin defects in van der Waals materials
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Spin defects in van der Waals materials offer a promising platform for advancing quantum technologies. Here, we propose and demonstrate a powerful technique based on isotope engineering of host materials to significantly enhance the coherence properties of embedded spin defects. Focusing on the recently-discovered negatively charged boron vacancy center (VB-) in hexagonal boron nitride (hBN), we grow isotopically purified h(10)B(15)N crystals. Compared to VB- in hBN with the natural distribution of isotopes, we observe substantially narrower and less crowded VB- spin transitions as well as extended coherence time T-2 and relaxation time T-1. For quantum sensing, VB- centers in our h(10)B(15)N samples exhibit a factor of 4 (2) enhancement in DC (AC) magnetic field sensitivity. For additional quantum resources, the individual addressability of the VB- hyperfine levels enables the dynamical polarization and coherent control of the three nearest-neighbor N-15 nuclear spins. Our results demonstrate the power of isotope engineering for enhancing the properties of quantum spin defects in hBN, and can be readily extended to improving spin qubits in a broad family of van der Waals materials.

TI Experimental certification of contextuality, coherence, and dimension in
   a programmable universal photonic processor
SO SCIENCE ADVANCES
AB Quantum superposition of high-dimensional states enables both computational speed-up and security in cryptographic protocols. However, the exponential complexity of tomographic processes makes certification of these properties a challenging task. In this work, we experimentally certify coherence witnesses tailored for quantum systems of increasing dimension using pairwise overlap measurements enabled by a six-mode universal photonic processor fabricated with a femtosecond laser writing technology. In particular, we show the effectiveness of the proposed coherence and dimension witnesses for qudits of dimensions up to 5. We also demonstrate advantage in a quantum interrogation task and show it is fueled by quantum contextuality. Our experimental results testify to the efficiency of this approach for the certification of quantum properties in programmable integrated photonic platforms.

TI Escaping Detrimental Interactions with Microwave-Dressed Transmon Qubits
SO CHINESE PHYSICS LETTERS
AB Superconducting transmon qubits with fixed frequencies are widely used in many applications due to their advantages of better coherence and less control lines compared to the frequency tunable qubits. However, any uncontrolled interactions with the qubits such as the two-level systems could lead to adverse impacts, degrading the qubit coherence and inducing crosstalk. To mitigate the detrimental effect from uncontrolled interactions between qubits and defect modes in fixed-frequency transmon qubits, we propose and demonstrate an active approach using an off-resonance microwave drive to dress the qubit and to induce the ac-Stark shift on the qubit frequency. We show experimentally that the qubit frequency can be tuned well away from the defect mode so that the impact on qubit coherence is greatly reduced while maintaining the universal controls of the qubit initialization, readout, and single-qubit gate operations. Our approach provides an effective way for tuning the qubit frequency and suppressing the detrimental effect from the defect modes that happen to be located close to the qubit frequency.

TI The NISQ Complexity of Collision Finding
SO ADVANCES IN CRYPTOLOGY, PT IV, EUROCRYPT 2024

CT 43rd Annual International Conference on the Theory and Applications of
   Cryptographic Techniques (EUROCRYPT)
CY MAY 26-30, 2024
CL Zurich, SWITZERLAND
AB Collision-resistant hashing, a fundamental primitive in modern cryptography, ensures that there is no efficient way to find distinct inputs that produce the same hash value. This property underpins the security of various cryptographic applications, making it crucial to understand its complexity. The complexity of this problem is well-understood in the classical setting and Theta(N-1/2) queries are needed to find a collision. However, the advent of quantum computing has introduced new challenges since quantum adversaries-equipped with the power of quantum queries-can find collisions much more efficiently. Brassard, Hoyer and Tapp [15] and Aaronson and Shi [3] established that full-scale quantum adversaries require Theta(N-1/3) queries to find a collision, prompting a need for longer hash outputs, which impacts efficiency in terms of the key lengths needed for security.
   This paper explores the implications of quantum attacks in the Noisy-Intermediate Scale Quantum (NISQ) era. In this work, we investigate three different models for NISQ algorithms and achieve tight bounds for all of them:
   1. A hybrid algorithm making adaptive quantum or classical queries but with a limited quantum query budget, or
   2. A quantum algorithm with access to a noisy oracle, subject to a dephasing or depolarizing channel, or
   3. A hybrid algorithm with an upper bound on its maximum quantum depth; i.e. a classical algorithm aided by low-depth quantum circuits. In fact, our results handle all regimes between NISQ and full-scale quantum computers. Previously, only results for the preimage search problem were known for these models (by Sun and Zheng [50], Rosmanis [45,46], Chen, Cotler, Huang and Li [17]) while nothing was known about the collision finding problem.
   Along with our main results, we develop an information-theoretic framework for recording query transcripts of quantum-classical algorithms. The main feature of this framework is that it allows us to record queries in two incompatible bases-classical queries in the standard basis and quantum queries in the Fourier basis-consistently. We call the framework the hybrid compressed oracle as it naturally interpolates between the classical way of recording queries and the compressed oracle framework of Zhandry for recording quantum queries. We demonstrate its applicability by giving simpler proofs of the optimal lower bounds for NISQ preimage search and by showing optimal lower bounds for NISQ collision finding.

TI Scalable manufacturing of quantum light emitters in silicon under rapid
   thermal annealing
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB Quantum light sources play a fundamental role in quantum technologies ranging from quantum networking to quantum sensing and computation. The development of these technologies requires scalable platforms, and the recent discovery of quantum light sources in silicon represents an exciting and promising prospect for scalability. The usual process for creating color centers in silicon involves carbon implantation into silicon, followed by rapid thermal annealing. However, the dependence of critical optical properties, such as the inhomogeneous broadening, the density, and the signal-to-background ratio, on centers implantation steps is poorly understood. We investigate the role of rapid thermal annealing on the dynamic of the formation of single color centers in silicon. We find that the density and the inhomogeneous broadening greatly depend on the annealing time. We attribute the observations to nanoscale thermal processes occurring around single centers and leading to local strain fluctuations. Our experimental observation is supported by theoretical modeling based on first principles calculations. The results indicate that annealing is currently the main step limiting the scalable manufacturing of color centers in silicon.(c) 2023 Optica Publishing Group under the terms of the Optica Open Access Publishing Agreement

TI Triply Efficient Shadow Tomography
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB We investigate the problem of efficiently estimating expectation values of large sets of observables from copies of an unknown many-body quantum state. This task, known as shadow tomography, is crucial for quantum simulation and quantum chemistry, where the relevant observables often include k-body fermionic or k-local Pauli operators. A key goal is to achieve sample efficiency, computational efficiency, and few-copy measurements. We introduce the notion of triply efficient shadow tomography to formalize these requirements. Prior work has shown that single-copy measurements suffice for k-local Pauli operators with constant k. However, we prove that for k-body fermionic observables and the full set of n-qubit Pauli operators, single-copy protocols fail to achieve sample-efficient tomography. We then present new protocols based on measuring two copies of the state at a time that overcome these lower bounds, providing a triply efficient protocol.

TI Quantum Honeypots
SO ENTROPY
AB Quantum computation offers unique properties that cannot be paralleled by conventional computers. In particular, reading qubits may change their state and thus signal the presence of an intruder. This paper develops a proof-of-concept for a quantum honeypot that allows the detection of intruders on reading. The idea is to place quantum sentinels within all resources offered within the honeypot. Additional to classical honeypots, honeypots with quantum sentinels can trace the reading activity of the intruder within any resource. Sentinels can be set to be either visible and accessible to the intruder or hidden and unknown to intruders. Catching the intruder using quantum sentinels has a low theoretical probability per sentinel, but the probability can be increased arbitrarily higher by adding more sentinels. The main contributions of this paper are that the monitoring of the intruder can be carried out at the level of the information unit, such as the bit, and quantum monitoring activity is fully hidden from the intruder. Practical experiments, as performed in this research, show that the error rate of quantum computers has to be considerably reduced before implementations of this concept are feasible.

TI Parallel Gate Fidelity of Flip-Flop Qubits in Small 1D-and 2D-Arrays in
   a Noisy Environment
SO ADVANCED QUANTUM TECHNOLOGIES
AB The long coherence time of donor atom nuclear spin states and of its bounded electron in 28Si$<^>{28}{\rm Si}$ can be exploited to define a qubit. This work is focused on a type of donor- and quantum dot-based qubit, the flip-flop (FF) qubit, that leverages antiparallel electron-nuclear spin states of a 31P$<^>{31}{\rm P}$ donor atom controlled by an electric field. It can provide long-range inter-qubit interactions in the order of some hundreds of nanometers, thus relaxing the common constraints and tolerances on inter-qubit distances in donor-based qubits. Simulation results of linear array (LA) and square array (SA) of four FF qubits are presented to study the effect of noise, idle qubits, and simultaneous gating (parallel gating) on gate fidelity. The impact of noise and qubit mutual coupling for both considered types of array are presented and the obtained fidelity results are compared.

TI Bifurcation Oscillator as an Advanced Sensor for Quantum State Control
SO SENSORS
AB We study bifurcation behavior of a high-quality (high-Q) Josephson oscillator coupled to a superconducting qubit. It is shown that the probability of capture into the state of dynamic equilibrium is sensitive to qubit states. On this basis we present a new measurement method for the superposition state of a qubit due to its influence on transition probabilities between oscillator levels located in the energy region near the classical separatrix. The quantum-mechanical behavior of a bifurcation oscillator is also studied, which makes it possible to understand the mechanism of "entanglement" of oscillator and qubit states during the measurement process. The optimal parameters of the driving current and the state of the oscillator are found for performing one-qubit gates with the required precision, when the influence on the qubit from measurement back-action is minimal. A measurement protocol for state populations of the qubit entangled with the oscillator is presented.

AB Diophantine problems arise frequently in physics, in for example anomaly cancellation conditions, string consistency conditions and so forth. We present methods to solve such problems to high order on annealers that are based on the quadratic Ising Model. This is the intrinsic framework for both quantum annealing and for common forms of classical simulated annealing. We demonstrate the method on so-called Taxicab numbers (discovering some apparently new ones), and on the realistic problem of anomaly cancellation in U(1) extensions of the Standard Model.

TI The proximity effect and critical field behavior of Re/Al bilayers
SO MATERIALS RESEARCH EXPRESS
AB We report the perpendicular critical field H-c2 properties of disordered Re-Al bilayers via magneto-transport measurements. The bilayers consisted of a dRe=3 nm bottom layer of Re and an upper Al layer with thickness varying between d(Al) = 0 - 3 nm. We find that in this range of Al thicknesses, the bilayer transition temperature T-c increases with increasing Al thickness, although their monolayer counterparts have TcRe>TcAl. Furthermore, H-c2 of the bilayers has a local maximum at an Al coverage of 1.5 nm with a critical field that is 50% larger than that of the standalone 3 nm Re film. At higher Al thicknesses H-c2 drops rapidly but remains more than an order of magnitude greater that that of comparable thickness standalone Al film. Our data show that a thin, disordered Re under-layer can dramatically increase the magnetic field tolerance of the Al over-layer. This would allow one to retain the desirable chemical and metallurgical properties of Al without sacrificing high field compatibility in quantum circuits, such as topological qubit devices and superinductor circuits.

TI Optomechanical dynamics: exploring membrane effects on cavity mode
   frequencies
SO TURKISH JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB Optomechanics is an emerging research topic that explores the mechanical effects of light. In this paper, we present an analytical study of the mode frequency perturbation in a three-dimensional Fabry-P & eacute;rot cavity containing a partially transparent membrane. Our analysis reveals that the maximum effect of the membrane occurs when it is placed at an antinode, where the field is at its maximum. The effect is minimized when the membrane is placed at a node, where the field is at a minimum, corroborating earlier one-dimensional "dielectric bump model" calculations. In contrast to previous models, we consider the membrane's finite thickness and the curvature of the end mirrors, showing that the mode frequency varies with membrane thickness and beam waist. Understanding how mode frequency depends on system geometry and membrane position is crucial, as it impacts the optomechanical coupling strength, which is vital for investigating the boundary between quantum and classical mechanics and has significant implications for quantum technology applications.

TI Field deployable atomics package for an optical lattice clock
SO QUANTUM SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB An atomics package is the heart of any atom based quantum sensing device. Here we report on the realisation of a field deployable atomics package for alkaline earth atoms, e.g. Sr or Yb. In terms of size (similar to 121 L), weight (<75 kg) and power (similar to 320 W), it is the smallest package to date which is designed to load Sr atoms into an optical lattice. It consists of an ultra-high vacuum assembly (<4 L), lasers, magnetic field coils & optics required for cooling & trapping as well as a module for imaging & detection. The package can routinely produce ultra cold and dense samples of 1.6 x 10(5) Sr-88 atoms trapped in a 1D optical lattice in less than a second. Its robustness has been demonstrated by conducting two transportation campaigns within out-of-the-lab environments. This advancement will have impact not only on transportable optical clock development but also will influence the wider areas of quantum science and technologies, particularly requiring field deployable cold atom based quantum sensors.

TI Ultimate quantum limit for amplification: a single atom in front of a
   mirror
SO NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB We investigate three types of amplification processes for light fields coupling to an atom near the end of a one-dimensional (1D) semi-infinite waveguide. We consider two setups where a drive creates population inversion in the bare or dressed basis of a three-level atom and one setup where the amplification is due to higher-order processes in a driven two-level atom. In all cases, the end of the waveguide acts as a mirror for the light. We find that this enhances the amplification in two ways compared to the same setups in an open waveguide. Firstly, the mirror forces all output from the atom to travel in one direction instead of being split up into two output channels. Secondly, interference due to the mirror enables tuning of the ratio of relaxation rates for different transitions in the atom to increase population inversion. We quantify the enhancement in amplification due to these factors and show that it can be demonstrated for standard parameters in experiments with superconducting quantum circuits.

TI Simplified projection on total spin zero for state preparation on
   quantum computers
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW C
AB We introduce a simple algorithm for projecting on J = 0 states of a many-body system by performing a series of rotations to remove states with angular momentum projections greater than zero. Existing methods rely on unitary evolution with the two-body operator J2, which when expressed in the computational basis contains many complicated Pauli strings requiring Trotterization and leading to very deep quantum circuits. Our approach performs the necessary projections using the one-body operators Jx and Jz. By leveraging the method of Cartan decomposition, the unitary transformations that perform the projection can be parametrized as a product of a small number of two-qubit rotations, with angles determined by an efficient classical optimization. Given the reduced complexity in terms of gates, this approach can be used to prepare approximate ground states of even-even nuclei by projecting onto the J = 0 component of deformed Hartree-Fock states. We estimate the resource requirements in terms of the universal gate set {H, S, CNOT, T} and briefly discuss a variant of the algorithm that projects onto J = 1/2 states of a system with an odd number of fermions.

AB When a composite Lindblad system consists of weakly coupled sub-systems with fast and slow timescales, the description of slow dynamics can be simplified by discarding fast degrees of freedom. This model reduction technique is called adiabatic elimination. While second-order perturbative expansion with respect to the timescale separation has revealed that the evolution of a reduced state is completely positive, this paper presents an example exhibiting complete positivity violation in the fourth-order expansion. Despite the non-uniqueness of slow dynamics parametrization, we prove that complete positivity cannot be ensured in any parametrization. The violation stems from correlation in the initial state.

TI Parameter shift rule with optimal phase selection
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Parameter shift rules enable the estimation of the derivatives of expectation values with respect to the dynamical evolution of a state. Thus, they provide a valuable tool in variational optimization and insight into the dynamical behavior of quantum systems. Constructing parameter shift rules applicable to complex dynamical generators is useful towards improving the control of analog quantum simulation devices and extending the applicability of variational quantum simulating methods. However, parameter shift rules are typically designed only for dynamical generators with highly degenerate or equidistant eigenvalues, such as Pauli operators, commonplace in the construction of parametrized quantum circuits. For generators with irregularly spaced eigenvalues, effective rules have not been established. We provide insights about the optimal design of a parameter shift rule tailored to various sorts of spectral information that may be available. The proposed method targets the calculation of any linear combination of k th derivatives with respect to the conjugate variable of a generator with a known spectrum, regardless of how close the eigenvalues are to each other. We discuss the optimal choice of parameter shifts, minimizing their number and the variance of the target estimator. Furthermore, we discuss the construction of parameter shift rules when only partial information about the generator spectrum is known.

TI Optimal compression of quantum many-body time evolution operators into
   brickwall circuits
SO SCIPOST PHYSICS
AB Near term quantum computers suffer from a degree of decoherence which is prohibitive for high fidelity simulations with deep circuits. An economical use of circuit depth is therefore paramount. For digital quantum simulation of quantum many-body systems, real time evolution is typically achieved by a Trotter decomposition of the time evolution operator into circuits consisting only of two qubit gates. To match the geometry of the physical system and the CNOT connectivity of the quantum processor, additional SWAP gates are needed. We show that optimal fidelity, beyond what is achievable by simple Trotter decompositions for a fixed gate count, can be obtained by compiling the evolution operator into optimal brickwall circuits for the S = 1/2 quantum Heisenberg model on chains and ladders, when mapped to one dimensional quantum processors without the need of additional SWAP gates.

TI Tiled unitary product states for strongly correlated Hamiltonians
SO FARADAY DISCUSSIONS
AB Approximating the electronic wave function for strongly correlated systems remains a major theoretical challenge. Emerging quantum computers can enable new types of wave-function ansatz to be considered, with the potential to overcome the exponential memory storage for strong correlation. I have recently introduced the tiled Unitary Product States (tUPS) ansatz, which successfully combines the preservation of particle-number and spin symmetry with shallow quantum circuits and local qubit connectivity [H. G. A. Burton, Phys. Rev. Res., 2024, 6, 023300]. In this contribution, I investigate the accuracy of this tUPS hierarchy for strongly-correlated Hamiltonians. I consider the picket-fence pairing Hamiltonian and the two-dimensional Hubbard lattice, which collectively describe a range of strong correlation mechanisms found in molecules. Numerical results demonstrate that highly accurate energies can be achieved with a compact approximation for both weak and strong correlation in the Hubbard model, and the repulsive pairing regime. These data provide valuable insights into the applicability of the tUPS hierarchy for strong electron correlation.

In this review, we discuss in detail the structures, preparation methods, band structures, electronic properties, and optoelectronic applications (photocatalysis, photoelectric detection, solar cells, light-emitting diodes, lasers, and optical quantum information processing) of pyramidal low-dimensional semiconductors and demonstrate their excellent photoelectric performances. More specifically, pyramidal semiconductor quantum dots (PSQDs) possess higher mobilities and longer lifetimes, which would be more suitable for photovoltaic devices requiring fast carrier transport. In addition, the linear polarization direction of exciton emission is easily controlled via the direction of magnetic field in PSQDs with C3v symmetry, so that all-optical multi-qubit gates based on electron spin as a quantum bit could be realized. Therefore, the use of PSQDs (e.g., InAs, GaN, InGaAs, and InGaN) as effective candidates for constructing optical quantum devices is examined due to the growing interest in optical quantum information processing. Pyramidal semiconductor nanorods (PSNRs) and pyramidal semiconductor nanowires (PSNWRs) also exhibit the more efficient separation of electron-hole pairs and strong light absorption effects, which are expected to be widely utilized in light-receiving devices. Finally, this review concludes with a summary of the current problems and suggestions for potential future research directions in the context of pyramidal low-dimensional semiconductors.

TI Measurement-free reconstruction circuit of quantum secrets in quantum
   secret sharing
SO QUANTUM INFORMATION PROCESSING
AB For a quantum secret sharing scheme built from a general quantum stabilizer code, no measurement-free circuit has been known for reconstructing its quantum secrets, except particular classes, such as one proposed by Cleve, Gottesman and Lo. We propose a measurement-free reconstruction circuit of quantum secrets in quantum secret sharing based on stabilizer codes. Our reconstruction circuit has width k+|J|\documentclass[12pt]{minimal} \usepackage{amsmath} \usepackage{wasysym} \usepackage{amsfonts} \usepackage{amssymb} \usepackage{amsbsy} \usepackage{mathrsfs} \usepackage{upgreek} \setlength{\oddsidemargin}{-69pt} \begin{document}$$k+|J|$$\end{document} and consists of O(k|J|) one- or two-qudit unitary gates when |J| participants reconstruct k-qudit quantum secrets.

TI Topologically protected subradiant cavity polaritons through linewidth
   narrowing enabled by dissipationless edge states
SO QUANTUM SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB Cavity polaritons derived from strong light-matter interaction provide a basis for efficient manipulation of quantum states via cavity field. Polaritons with narrow linewidth and long lifetime are appealing in applications, such as quantum sensing and storage. Here, we propose a prototypical arrangement to implement a whispering-gallery-mode resonator with one-dimensional topological atom mirror, which allows to boost the lifetime of cavity polaritons over an order of magnitude. This considerable enhancement attributes to the coupling of polaritonic states to dissipationless edge states protected by the topological bandgap of atom mirror that suppresses the leakage of cavity modes. When exceeding the width of Rabi splitting, topological bandgap can further reduce the dissipation from polaritonic states to bulk states, giving arise to subradiant cavity polaritons with extremely sharp linewidth. The resultant Rabi oscillation experiences decay rate lower than the free-space decay of a single quantum emitter. Inheriting from the topologically protected properties of edge states, the subradiance of cavity polaritons can be preserved in disordered atom mirror with moderate perturbations involving the atomic frequency, interaction strengths and location fluctuations. Our work opens up a new paradigm of topology-engineered quantum states with robust quantum coherence for future applications in quantum computing and network.

TI Nonlinear dynamics and chaos control of the quantum Cournot-Bertrand
   duopoly game model
SO PHYSICA SCRIPTA
AB This paper examines a duopoly market comprising two firms, where the first firm optimizes its output and the second firm optimizes its price. We establish a quantum Cournot-Bertrand dynamical system from the perspective of quantum game theory to study the existence and stability conditions of equilibrium points and conduct bifurcation analysis on equilibrium points. A controlled quantum Cournot-Bertrand dynamical system is also established, which delays, advances, or eliminates the generation of bifurcations and chaos by appropriately selecting model parameter values. Finally, numerical simulation and analysis are conducted to verify the theoretical correctness of the research model and explore the influence of model parameter values on quantum game strategies. We also provide relevant economic explanations in the process. The research results indicate that the potential market size increases will lead to the instability of the quantum strategy. The impact of the two firms' cost control parameters on their respective quantum strategy is reversed. The second firm's control parameter of cost continuously decreasing will lead to its quantum strategy entering bifurcations and chaos. The quantum strategy's sensitivity to the second firm's marginal cost, strategy adjustment speed, and quantum entanglement degree is higher than that of the first firm's marginal cost, strategy adjustment speed, and quantum entanglement degree, respectively. The continuous increase of other parameter values will lead to the second firm's quantum strategy entering bifurcation and chaos, followed by the first firm's quantum strategy entering bifurcation and chaos.

TI Twenty-three-millisecond electron spin coherence of erbium ions in a
   natural-abundance crystal
SO SCIENCE ADVANCES
AB Erbium ions embedded in crystals have unique properties for quantum information processing, because of their optical transition at 1.5 mu m and of the large magnetic moment of their effective spin-1/2 electronic ground state. Most applications of erbium require, however, long electron spin coherence times, and this has so far been missing. Here, by selecting a host matrix with a low nuclear-spin density (CaWO4) and by quenching the spectral diffusion due to residual paramagnetic impurities at millikelvin temperatures, we obtain a 23-ms coherence time on the Er3+ electron spin transition. This is the longest Hahn echo electron spin coherence time measured in a material with a natural abundance of nuclear spins and on a magnetically sensitive transition. Our results establish Er3+:CaWO4 as a potential platform for quantum networks.

TI Dynamical nuclear polarization for dissipation-induced entanglement in
   NV centers
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
AB We propose a practical implementation of a two-qubit entanglement engine which denotes a scheme to generate quantum correlations through purely dissipative processes. On a diamond platform, the electron spin transitions of two nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers play the role of artificial atoms (qubits), interacting through a dipole-dipole Hamiltonian. The surrounding carbon-13 nuclear spins act as spin baths playing the role of thermal reservoirs at well-defined temperatures and exchanging heat through the NV center qubits. In our scheme, a key challenge is therefore to create a temperature gradient between two spin baths, for which we propose to exploit the recent progress in dynamical nuclear polarization, combined with microscopy superresolution methods. We discuss how these techniques should allow us to initialize such a long lasting out-of-equilibrium polarization situation between them, effectively leading to suitable conditions to run the entanglement engine successfully. Within a quantum master equation approach, we make theoretical predictions using state-of-the-art values for experimental parameters. We obtain promising values for the concurrence, reaching theoretical maxima.

TI Determining reaction pathways at low temperatures by isotopic
   substitution: the case of BeD + + H2O
SO NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB Trapped Be+ ions are a leading platform for quantum information science (Gaebler et al 2016 Phys. Rev. Lett. ), but reactions with background gas species, such as H-2 and H2O, result in qubit loss. Our experiment reveals that the BeOH+ ion is the final trapped ion species when both H-2 and H2O exist in a vacuum system with cold, trapped Be+. The BeH+ product in the Be+ + H-2 reaction further reacts with H2O to form BeOH+. To understand the loss mechanism, low-temperature reactions between sympathetically cooled BeD+ ions and H2O molecules have been investigated using an integrated, laser-cooled Be+ ion trap and high-resolution time-of-flight mass spectrometer (Schneider et al 2014 Phys. Rev. Appl. ). Among all the possible products, BeH2O+, H2DO+, BeOD+, and BeOH+, only the BeOH+ molecular ion was observed experimentally, with the assumed co-product of HD. Theoretical analyses based on explicitly correlated restricted coupled cluster singles, doubles, and perturbative triples (RCCSD(T)-F12) method with the augmented correlation-consistent polarized triple zeta (AVTZ) basis set reveal that two intuitive direct abstraction product channels, Be + H2DO+ and D + BeH2O+, are not energetically accessible at the present reaction temperature (similar to 150 K). Instead, a double displacement BeOH+ + HD product channel is accessible due to a large exothermicity of 1.885 eV through a submerged barrier in the reaction pathway. While the BeOD+ + H-2 product channel has a similar exothermicity, the reaction pathway is dynamically unfavourable, as suggested by a sudden vector projection analysis. This work sheds light on the origin of the loss and contaminations of the laser-cooled Be+ ions in quantum-information experiments.

TI Error-tolerant quantum convolutional neural networks for
   symmetry-protected topological phases
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB The analysis of noisy quantum states prepared on current quantum computers is getting beyond the capabilities of classical computing. Quantum neural networks based on parametrized quantum circuits, measurements and feed-forward can process large amounts of quantum data to reduce measurement and computational costs of detecting nonlocal quantum correlations. The tolerance of errors due to decoherence and gate infidelities is a key requirement for the application of quantum neural networks on near-term quantum computers. Here we construct quantum convolutional neural networks (QCNNs) that can, in the presence of incoherent errors, recognize different symmetry-protected topological phases of generalized cluster-Ising Hamiltonians from one another as well as from topologically trivial phases. Using matrix product state simulations, we show that the QCNN output is robust against symmetry-breaking errors below a threshold error probability and against symmetry-preserving errors provided the error channel is invertible. This is in contrast to string order parameters and the output of previously designed QCNNs, which vanish in the presence of any symmetry-breaking errors. To facilitate the implementation of the QCNNs on near-term quantum computers, the QCNN circuits can be shortened from logarithmic to constant depth in system size by performing a large part of the computation in classical postprocessing. These constant-depth QCNNs reduce sample complexity exponentially with system size in comparison to the direct sampling using local Pauli measurements.

TI Optomechanically-induced nonreciprocal conversion between microwave and
   optical photons
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB We theoretically propose a scheme of the nonreciprocal conversion device between photons of two arbitrary frequencies in a hybrid cavity optomechanical system, where two optical cavities and two microwave cavities are coupled to two different mechanical resonators via radiation pressure. Two mechanical resonators are coupled together via the Coulomb interaction. We study the nonreciprocal conversions between both the same and different types of frequency photons. The device is based on multichannel quantum interference to break the time-reversal symmetry. Our results show the perfect nonreciprocity conditions. By adjusting the Coulomb interaction and the phase differences, we find that the nonreciprocity can be modulated and even transformed into reciprocity. These results provide new insight into the design of nonreciprocal devices, including isolators, circulators, and routers in quantum information processing and quantum networks.(c) 2023 Optica Publishing Group under the terms of the Optica Open Access Publishing Agreement

TI Optimum-preserving QUBO parameter compression
SO QUANTUM MACHINE INTELLIGENCE
AB Quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO) problems are well-studied, not least because they can be approached using contemporary quantum annealing or classical hardware acceleration. However, due to limited precision and hardware noise, the effective set of feasible parameter values is severely restricted. As a result, otherwise solvable problems become harder or even intractable. In this work, we study the implications of solving QUBO problems under limited precision. Specifically, it is shown that the problem's dynamic range has a crucial impact on the problem's robustness against distortions. We show this by formalizing the notion of preserving optima between QUBO instances and explore to which extend parameters can be modified without changing the set of minimizing solutions. Based on these insights, we introduce techniques to reduce the dynamic range of a given QUBO instance based on the theoretical bounds of the minimal energy value. An experimental evaluation on random QUBO instances as well as QUBO-encoded BinClustering and SubsetSum problems show that our theoretical findings manifest in practice. Results on quantum annealing hardware show that the performance can be improved drastically when following our methodology.

TI Exploiting Atomic Control to Show When Atoms Become Molecules
SO ADVANCED FUNCTIONAL MATERIALS
AB Precision-placed atom qubits in silicon offer a unique means to confine electrons and control their spins with extreme accuracy, which can be leveraged to construct powerful quantum computers. To date atom qubits in silicon have been successfully realized using electrons hosted either on a single phosphorus atom or on a multi-donor quantum dot. Here, a novel molecular regime is explored in which electrons are bound to two donor dots separated by approximate to 8 nm in a natural silicon substrate. The molecular state, provided by these spatially separated donors, is used to study with exquisite precision the impact of confinement potential on the electronic and spin properties of qubits. Unique spin filling measurements, performed on up to five electrons, confirm how electrons are shared between both sites of the molecule, forming hybridized molecular states. The precise atomic locations of the donor atoms in the silicon lattice are determined by combining the experimental electron spin resonance spectra and the state-of-the-art atomistic modeling of multi-electron wave-functions in presence of realistic electric fields. The donor molecule studied in this work exhibits excellent qubit properties and addresses the impact that the confinement potential has, at the atomic scale, on the desired properties of electron spin qubits.
   A formation of novel molecular spin states is shown using precision-placed atom qubits in silicon. This work explores this molecular regime to demonstrate that qubit confinement potential can be engineered at the atomic scale to control the shape and size of the electron wavefunction and consequently to optimize the properties of electron spin qubits.image

TI Cavity polariton blockade for non-local entangling gates with trapped
   atoms
SO QUANTUM SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB We propose a scheme for realizing multi-qubit entangled W-state and non-local CZ and C2Z gates via a cavity polariton blockade mechanism with a system of atomic qubits coupled to a common cavity mode. The polariton blockade is achieved by tuning the system, an N-qubit register, such that no two atoms are simultaneously excited to the qubit excited state, and there is an effective coupling only between the ground state and a singly-excited W state of the qubit register. The control step requires only an external drive of the cavity mode and a global qubit pulse and no individual qubit addressing. We analytically obtain the state preparation error upper bound for an N-qubit W state which scales as (1-1/N)/C where C is the single particle cooperativity. We additionally show the application of the polariton blockade mechanism in realizing a non-local CZ and C2Z gate by using a different set of computational qubit states, and characterize the gate infidelity upper bounds which scale as similar to 1/C.

TI Probing a Dissipative Phase Transition with a Trapped Ion through
   Reservoir Engineering
SO CHINESE PHYSICS LETTERS
AB Dissipation is often considered as a detrimental effect in quantum systems for unitary quantum operations. However, it has been shown that suitable dissipation can be useful resources in both quantum information and quantum simulation. Here, we propose and experimentally simulate a dissipative phase transition (DPT) model using a single trapped ion with an engineered reservoir. We show that the ion's spatial oscillation mode reaches a steady state after the alternating application of unitary evolution under a quantum Rabi model Hamiltonian and sideband cooling of the oscillator. The average phonon number of the oscillation mode is used as the order parameter to provide evidence for the DPT. Our work highlights the suitability of trapped ions for simulating open quantum systems and shall facilitate further investigations of DPT with various dissipation terms.

TI Fully integrated four-channel wavelength-division multiplexed QKD
   receiver
SO OPTICA
AB Quantum key distribution(QKD) enables secure communication even in the presence of advanced quantum computers. However, scaling up discrete-variable QKD to high key rates remains a challenge due to the lossy nature of quantum communication channels and the use of weak coherent states. Photonic integration and massive parallelization are crucial steps toward the goal of high-throughput secret-key distribution. We present a fully integrated photonic chip on silicon nitride featuring a four-channel wavelength-division demultiplexed QKD receiver circuit including state-of-the-art wave guide-integrated superconducting nano wire single-photon detectors (SNSPDs). With a proof-of-principle setup operated at a clock rate of 3.35 GHz, we achieve a total secret-key rate of up to 12.17 Mbit/s at 10 dB channel attenuation with low detector-induced error rates. The QKD receiver architecture is massively scalable and constitutes a foundation for high-rate many-channel QKD transmission.

TI Steering interchange of polariton branches via coherent and incoherent
   dynamics
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Controlling light-matter-based quantum systems in the strong coupling regime allows for exploring quantum simulation of many-body physics in current architectures. For instance, the atom-field interaction in a cavity QED network provides control and scalability for quantum information processing. Here, we propose the control of single- and two-body Jaynes-Cummings systems in a nonequilibrium scenario, which allows us to establish conditions for the coherent and incoherent interchange of polariton branches. Our findings provide a systematic approach to manipulate the interchange of polaritons, which we apply to reveal insights into the transition between Mott-insulator- and superfluid-like states. Furthermore, we study the asymmetry in the absorption spectrum by triggering the cavity and atomic losses as a function of the atom-cavity detuning and the photon's hopping.

TI Ground state cooling of an ultracoherent electromechanical system
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Cavity electromechanics relies on parametric coupling between microwave and mechanical modes to manipulate the mechanical quantum state, and provide a coherent interface between different parts of hybrid quantum systems. High coherence of the mechanical mode is of key importance in such applications, in order to protect the quantum states it hosts from thermal decoherence. Here, we introduce an electromechanical system based around a softclamped mechanical resonator with an extremely high Q-factor (>10(9)) held at very low (30 mK) temperatures. This ultracoherent mechanical resonator is capacitively coupled to a microwave mode, strong enough to enable ground-state-cooling of the mechanics ((n) over bar (min) = 0:76 +/- 0:16). This paves the way towards exploiting the extremely long coherence times (t(coh) > 100 ms) offered by such systems for quantum information processing and state conversion.

TI Universally Optimal Verification of Entangled States with Nondemolition
   Measurements
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB The efficient and reliable characterization of quantum states plays a vital role in most, if not all, quantum information processing tasks. In this work, we present a universally optimal protocol for verifying entangled states by employing the so-called quantum nondemolition measurements, such that the verification efficiency is equivalent to that of the optimal global strategy. Instead of being probabilistic as the standard verification strategies, our protocol is constructed sequentially, which is thus more favorable for experimental realizations. In addition, the target states are preserved in the protocol after each measurement, so can be reused in any subsequent tasks. We demonstrate the power of our protocol for the optimal verification of Bell states, arbitrary two-qubit pure states, and stabilizer states. We also prove that our protocol is able to perform tasks including fidelity estimation and state preparation.

TI Miniature atom bottle traps enabled by chiral doughnut light
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB We highlight what we believe to be a novel optical set-up which enables the confinement of cold atoms in a finite set of sub -wavelength bottle traps. This involves two counter -propagating vortex beams with the same winding number <euro> = +/- 1 and the same circular polarization ( o- = -/+ 1). Strong focusing generates significant longitudinal field components which become responsible for an on -axis standing wave enabling the axial confinement of far blue-detuned atoms. The off -axis radial confinement is provided by the optical potential due to the transverse components of the light. The trap characteristics are illustrated using experimentally accessible parameters and are tunable by changing the power, focusing and ellipticity of the light. Atoms trapped in such a set-up are useful for applications, including quantum simulation and quantum information processing.

TI Quantum and classical dynamical semigroups of superchannels and
   semicausal channels
SO JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICAL PHYSICS
AB Quantum devices are subject to natural decay. We propose to study these decay processes as the Markovian evolution of quantum channels, which leads us to dynamical semigroups of superchannels. A superchannel is a linear map that maps quantum channels to quantum channels while satisfying suitable consistency relations. If the input and output quantum channels act on the same space, then we can consider dynamical semigroups of superchannels. No useful constructive characterization of the generators of such semigroups is known. We characterize these generators in two ways: First, we give an efficiently checkable criterion for whether a given map generates a dynamical semigroup of superchannels. Second, we identify a normal form for the generators of semigroups of quantum superchannels, analogous to the Gorini-Kossakowski-Lindblad-Sudarshan form in the case of quantum channels. To derive the normal form, we exploit the relation between superchannels and semicausal completely positive maps, reducing the problem to finding a normal form for the generators of semigroups of semicausal completely positive maps. We derive a normal for these generators using a novel technique, which applies also to infinite-dimensional systems. Our work paves the way for a thorough investigation of semigroups of superchannels: Numerical studies become feasible because admissible generators can now be explicitly generated and checked. Analytic properties of the corresponding evolution equations are now accessible via our normal form. (C) 2022 Author(s).

TI Single quantum emitters with spin ground states based on Cl bound
   excitons in ZnSe
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Defects in wide-band-gap semiconductors are promising qubit candidates for quantum communication and computation. Epitaxially grown II-VI semiconductors are particularly promising host materials due to their direct band gap and potential for isotopic purification to a spin-zero nuclear background. Here, we show an alternative type of single photon emitter with potential electron spin qubits based on Cl impurities in ZnSe. We utilize a quantum well to increase the binding energies of donor emission and confirm single photon emission with short radiative lifetimes of 192 ps. Furthermore, we verify that the ground state of the Cl donor complex contains a single electron by observing two-electron-satellite emission, leaving the electron in higher orbital states. We also characterize the Zeeman splitting of the exciton transition by performing polarization-resolved magnetic spectroscopy on single emitters. Our results suggest single Cl impurities are suitable as a single photon source with a potential photonic interface.

TI Chemical Reaction Simulator on Quantum Computers by First Quantization
   (II)-Basic Treatment: Implementation
SO JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL THEORY AND COMPUTATION
AB Chemical simulation is a key application area that can leverage the power of quantum computers. A chemical simulator that implements a grid-based first quantization method has promising characteristics, but an implementation fully in quantum circuits seems to have not been published. Here, we present "crsQ" (chemical reaction simulator Q), which is a quantum circuit generator that generates such a chemical simulator. The generated simulator is capable of antisymmetrization of the initial wave function and time-evolution of the wave function based on the Suzuki-Trotter decomposition. The potential energy term of the Hamiltonian is implemented using arithmetic gates, such as adders, subtractors, multipliers, dividers, and square roots. Circuit diagrams and output samples are shown. The number of qubits in the circuits scales on the order of O(eta log eta), where eta is the number of electrons. Each component of the generated circuit was verified in unit tests. Along with this development, we designed frameworks to ease the development of large-scale circuits, namely, a temporary qubit allocation framework and an abstract syntax tree framework for arithmetic formulas. These frameworks are expected to be useful in large-scale quantum circuit generators.

TI Quantum state preparation by adiabatic evolution with custom gates
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Quantum state preparation by adiabatic evolution is currently rendered ineffective by the long implementation times of the underlying quantum circuits, comparable to the decoherence time of present and near-term quantum devices. These implementation times can be significantly reduced by realizing these circuits with custom gates. Using classical computing, we model the output of a realistic two-qubit processor implementing the adiabatic evolution of a two-spin system by means of custom gates. This modeled output is then compared with the results of quantum simulations solving the same problem on IBM Quantum (IBMQ) systems. When used to emulate the behavior of the IBMQ quantum circuit, our realistic model yields state fidelities ranging from 65% to 85%, similar to the actual performance of a diverse set of IBMQ devices. When we reduced the implementation time by using custom gates, however, the loss of fidelity was reduced by at least a factor of 4, allowing us to accurately extract the energy of the target state. This improvement is enough to render adiabatic evolution useful for quantum state preparation for small systems or as a preconditioner for other state preparation methods.

TI Multi-Party Quantum Private Comparison Based on Entanglement Swapping of

SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF THEORETICAL PHYSICS
AB In this paper, a multi-party quantum private comparison (MQPC) scheme is suggested based on entanglement swapping of Bell entangled states within d-level quantum system, which can accomplish the equality comparison of secret binary sequences from n users via one execution of scheme. Detailed security analysis shows that both the outside attack and the participant attack are ineffective. The suggested scheme needn't establish a private key among n users beforehand through the quantum key distribution (QKD) method to encrypt the secret binary sequences. Compared with previous MQPC scheme based on d-level Cat states and d-level Bell entangled states, the suggested scheme has distinct advantages on quantum resource, quantum measurement of third party (TP) and qubit efficiency.

TI Quantum Image Segmentation Based on Grayscale Morphology
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON QUANTUM ENGINEERING
AB The classical image segmentation algorithm based on grayscale morphology can effectively segment images with uneven illumination, but with the increase of image data, the real-time problem will emerge. In order to solve this problem, a quantum image segmentation algorithm is proposed in this article, which can use a quantum mechanism to simultaneously perform morphological operations on all pixels in a grayscale image, and which then quickly segments the image into a binary image. In addition, several quantum circuit units, including dilation, erosion, bottom-hat transformation, top-hat transformation, etc., are designed in detail, and then, they are combined together to construct the complete quantum circuits for segmenting the novel enhanced quantum representation images. For a 2(n)x2(n) image with q grayscale levels, the complexity of our algorithm can be reduced to O (n(2)+q) , which is an exponential speedup than the classic counterparts. Finally, the experiment is conducted on IBM Q to show the feasibility of our algorithm in the noisy intermediate-scale quantum era.

TI High-Fidelity Electron Spin Gates for Scaling Diamond Quantum Registers
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW X
AB Diamond is a promising platform for quantum information processing as it can host highly coherent qubits that could allow for the construction of large quantum registers. A prerequisite for such devices is a coherent interaction between nitrogen-vacancy (NV) electron spins enabling scalable entanglement. Entanglement between dipolar-coupled NV spin pairs has been demonstrated but with a limited fidelity, and its error sources have not been characterized. Here, we design and implement a robust two-qubit gate between NV electron spins in diamond and quantify the influence of multiple error sources on the gate performance. Experimentally, we demonstrate a record gate fidelity of F2q = (96.0 + 2.5)% under ambient conditions. Our identification of the dominant errors paves the way towards NV-NV gates beyond the error correction threshold.

TI Predicting atmospheric turbulence for secure quantum communications in
   free space
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB Atmospheric turbulence is the main barrier to large-scale free-space quantum communication networks. Aberrations distort optical information carriers, thus limiting or preventing the possibility of establishing a secure link between two parties. For this reason, forecasting the turbulence strength within an optical channel is highly desirable, as it allows for knowing the optimal timing to establish a secure link in advance. Here, we train a recurrent neural network, TAROQQO, to predict the turbulence strength within a free-space channel. The training is based on weather and turbulence data collected over 9 months for a 5.4 km intra-city free-space link across the City of Ottawa. The implications of accurate predictions from our network are demonstrated in a simulated high-dimensional quantum key distribution protocol based on orbital angular momentum states of light across different turbulence regimes. TAROQQO will be crucial in validating a free-space channel to optimally route the key exchange for secure communications in real experimental scenarios.

TI Indistinguishability-Enhanced Entanglement Recovery by Spatially
   Localized Operations and Classical Communication
SO OPEN SYSTEMS & INFORMATION DYNAMICS
AB We extend a procedure exploiting spatial indistinguishability of identical particles to recover the spoiled entanglement between two qubits interacting with Markovian noisy environments. Here, the spatially localized operations and classical communication (sLOCC) operational framework is used to activate the entanglement restoration from the indistinguishable constituents. We consider the realistic scenario where noise acts for the whole duration of the process. Three standard types of noises are considered: a phase damping, a depolarizing, and an amplitude damping channel. Within this general scenario, we find the entanglement to be restored in an amount proportional to the degree of spatial indistinguishability. These results elevate sLOCC to a practical framework for accessing and utilizing quantum state protection within a quantum network of spatially indistinguishable subsystems.

TI Sequential propagation of a single photon through five measurement
   contexts in a three-path interferometer
SO OPTICA QUANTUM
AB Quantum contextuality describes scenarios in which it is impossible to explain the experimental evidence in terms of a measurement-independent reality. Here a three-path interferometer is introduced in which all five contexts needed for a demonstration of contextuality are realized in sequence. It is then possible to observe a paradoxical situation where the paths connecting input ports to their corresponding output ports appear to be blocked by destructive interference. It is shown that the conditional currents observed in weak measurements provide a consistent explanation of the paradox, indicating that weak values might help to bridge the gap between wave-like propagation effects and local particle detection.

Here, we use controlled dissipation as a resource and present an approach to generate programmable multimode entangled states in the vibrational modes of trapped ions, free of stringent requirements of initial state preparation. We experimentally demonstrate the generation of multimode squeezed states across two, three, and five modes out of initial thermal states by controlled couplings to dissipative internal spins. We characterize the output states by fidelity estimates and two-body correlations, confirming genuine multipartite entanglement using the van Loock-Furusawa inseparability criteria. This work outlines a generic path to create entangled nonclassical states with quantum harmonic oscillators, applicable for quantum information processing in continuous-variable quantum systems.

TI Variations on the Choi-Jamiołkowski isomorphism
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICS A-MATHEMATICAL AND THEORETICAL
AB The Choi-Jamio & lstrok;kowski isomorphism is an essential component in every quantum information theorist's toolkit: it allows to identify linear maps between two quantum systems with linear operators on the composite system. Here, we analyse this widely used gadget from a new perspective. Namely, we explicitly distinguish between its kinematical and dynamical properties, that is, we study the isomorphism on two different levels: Jordan algebras and the different C & lowast; -algebras they arise from, which are distinguished by their order of composition. A number of important and novel insights stem from our analysis. We find that Choi's theorem, which asserts that Choi's version of the isomorphism (Choi 1975 Lin. Alg. Appl. 10 285) further maps the positive cone of completely positive linear maps (such as quantum channels) to the cone of positive linear operators (such as quantum states) on the composite system, crucially depends on the dynamical structure in C & lowast; -algebras. We explain in detail how this dependence gives rise to the mismatch between the basis-dependence of Choi's version of the isomorphism, and the basis-independent version by Jamio & lstrok;kowski (1972 Rep. Math. Phys. 3 275). We then overcome this subtle but pervasive issue in a number of ways: first, we prove a version of Choi's theorem for Jamio & lstrok;kowski's isomorphism, second, we define a basis-independent variant of Choi's isomorphism and, third, by making explicit the dynamical distinction between Jordan and C & lowast; -algebras, we combine the different variants of the isomorphism into a unified description, that subsumes their individual features. We also embed and interpret our results in the graphical calculus of categorical quantum mechanics.

TI Atom-photon dressed states in a waveguide-QED system with multiple giant
   atoms
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB We study the properties of bound states in waveguide-QED systems consisting of multiple giant atoms coupled to a coupled -resonator waveguide. Based on the general analytical expressions for these states and the corresponding energy spectra, we analyze in detail the threshold conditions for the appearance of bound states and the photon -mediated interactions between dressed atoms for different configurations. In addition, when multiple giant atoms are coupled to the waveguide, different types of interacting atomic chain can be obtained by manipulating the coupling configurations. Accordingly, the energy spectra of the bound states form metaband structures in the photonic band gaps. This makes the system a useful platform for quantum simulation and quantum information processing. (c) 2024 Optica Publishing Group under the terms of the Optica Open Access Publishing Agreement

TI Holographic codes from hyperinvariant tensor networks
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Holographic quantum-error correcting codes are models of bulk/boundary dualities such as the anti-de Sitter/conformal field theory (AdS/CFT) correspondence, where a higher-dimensional bulk geometry is associated with the code's logical degrees of freedom. Previous discrete holographic codes based on tensor networks have reproduced the general code properties expected from continuum AdS/CFT, such as complementary recovery. However, the boundary states of such tensor networks typically do not exhibit the expected correlation functions of CFT boundary states. In this work, we show that a new class of exact holographic codes, extending the previously proposed hyperinvariant tensor networks into quantum codes, produce the correct boundary correlation functions. This approach yields a dictionary between logical states in the bulk and the critical renormalization group flow of boundary states. Furthermore, these codes exhibit a state-dependent breakdown of complementary recovery as expected from AdS/CFT under small quantum gravity corrections.

TI Sharing Classical Secrets with Continuous-Variable Entanglement:
   Composable Security and Network Coding Advantage
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB Secret sharing is a multiparty cryptographic primitive that can be applied to a network of partially distrustful parties for encrypting data that is both sensitive (it must remain secure) and important (it must not be lost or destroyed). When sharing classical secrets (as opposed to quantum states), one can distinguish between protocols that leverage bipartite quantum key distribution (QKD) and those that exploit multipartite entanglement. The latter class are known to be vulnerable to so-called participant attacks and, while progress has been made recently, there is currently no analysis that quantifies their performance in the composable, finite-size regime, which has become the gold standard for QKD security. Given this-and the fact that distributing multipartite entanglement is typically challenging one might well ask is there any virtue in pursuing multipartite entanglement-based schemes? Here, we answer this question in the affirmative for a class of secret-sharing protocols based on continuous-variable graph states. We establish security in a composable framework and identify a network topology, specifically a bottleneck network of lossy channels, and parameter regimes within the reach of present-day experiments for which a multipartite scheme outperforms the corresponding QKD-based method in the asymptotic and finite-size setting. Finally, we establish experimental parameters where the multipartite schemes outperform any possible QKD-based protocol. This is one of the first concrete compelling examples of multipartite entangled resources achieving a genuine advantage over point-to-point protocols for quantum communication and represents a rigorous, operational benchmark to assess the usefulness of such resources.

TI Characterizing and Tailoring Spatial Correlations in Multimode
   Parametric Down-Conversion
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW APPLIED
AB Photons entangled in their position-momentum degrees of freedom serve as an elegant manifestation of the Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen paradox, while also enhancing quantum technologies for communication, imaging, and computation. Themultimode nature of photons generated in parametric down-conversion has inspired a generation of experiments on high-dimensional entanglement, ranging from complete quantum state teleportation to exotic multipartite entanglement. However, precise characterization of the underlying position-momentum state is notoriously difficult due to limitations in detector technology, resulting in a slow and inaccurate reconstruction riddled with noise. Furthermore, theoretical models for the generated two-photon state often forgo the importance of the measurement system, resulting in a discrepancy between theory and experiment. Here we formalize a description of the two-photon wave function in the spatial domain, referred to as the collected joint-transverse momentum amplitude (JTMA), which incorporates both the generation and measurement system involved. We go on to propose and demonstrate a practical and efficient method to accurately reconstruct the collected JTMA using a simple phase-step scan known as the 2Dp measurement. Finally, we discuss how precise knowledge of the collected JTMA enables us to generate tailored high-dimensional entangled states that maximize discrete-variable entanglement measures such as entanglement of formation or entanglement dimensionality, and optimize critical experimental parameters such as photon heralding efficiency. By accurately and efficiently characterizing photonic position-momentum entanglement, our results unlock its full potential for discrete-variable quantum information science and lay the groundwork for future quantum technologies based onmultimode entanglement.

TI Quantum kernel methods for solving regression problems and differential
   equations
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB We propose several approaches for solving regression problems and differential equations (DEs) with quantum kernel methods. We compose quantum models as weighted sums of kernel functions, where variables are encoded using feature maps and model derivatives are represented using automatic differentiation of quantum circuits. While previously quantum kernel methods primarily targeted classification tasks, here we consider their applicability to regression tasks, based on available data and differential constraints. We use two strategies to approach these problems. First, we devise a mixed model regression with a trial solution represented by kernel-based functions, which is trained to minimize a loss for specific differential constraints or datasets. Second, we use support vector regression that accounts for the structure of differential equations. The developed methods are capable of solving both linear and nonlinear systems. Contrary to prevailing hybrid variational approaches for parametrized quantum circuits, we perform training of the weights of the model classically. Under certain conditions this corresponds to a convex optimization problem, which can be solved with provable convergence to global optimum of the model. The proposed approaches also favor hardware implementations, as optimization only uses evaluated Gram matrices, but require a quadratic number of function evaluations. We highlight trade-offs when comparing our methods to those based on variational quantum circuits such as the recently proposed differentiable quantum circuits approach. The proposed methods offer potential quantum enhancement through the rich kernel representations using the power of quantum feature maps, and start the quest towards provably trainable quantum DE solvers.

TI Classification of small triorthogonal codes
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Triorthogonal codes are a class of quantum error-correcting codes used in magic state distillation protocols. We classify all triorthogonal codes with n + k <= 38, where n is the number of physical qubits and k is the number of logical qubits of the code. We find 38 distinguished triorthogonal subspaces, and we show that every triorthogonal code with n + k <= 38 descends from one of these subspaces through elementary operations such as puncturing and deleting qubits. Specifically, we associate each triorthogonal code with a Reed-Muller polynomial of weight n + k, and we classify the Reed-Muller polynomials of low weight using the results of Kasami, Tokura, and Azumi [IEEE Trans. Inf. Theory 16, 752 (1970); Inf. Contr. 30, 380 (1976)] and an extensive computerized search. In an Appendix independent of the main text, we improve a magic state distillation protocol by reducing the time variance due to stochastic Clifford corrections.

TI A Metamodeling Approach to Enforcing the No-Cloning Theorem in Quantum
   Software Engineering
SO CMC-COMPUTERS MATERIALS & CONTINUA
AB Quantum software development utilizes quantum phenomena such as superposition and entanglement to address problems that are challenging for classical systems. However, it must also adhere to critical quantum constraints, notably the no-cloning theorem, which prohibits the exact duplication of unknown quantum states and has profound implications for cryptography, secure communication, and error correction. While existing quantum circuit representations implicitly honor such constraints, they lack formal mechanisms for early-stage verification in software design. Addressing this constraint at the design phase is essential to ensure the correctness and reliability of quantum software. This paper presents a formal metamodeling framework using UML-style notation and and Object Constraint Language (OCL) to systematically capture and enforce the no-cloning theorem within quantum software models. The proposed metamodel formalizes key quantum concepts-such as entanglement and teleportation-and encodes enforceable invariants that reflect core quantum mechanical laws. The framework's effectiveness is validated by analyzing two critical edge cases-conditional copying with CNOT gates and quantum teleportation-through instance model evaluations. These cases demonstrate that the metamodel can capture nuanced scenarios that are often mistaken as violations of the no-cloning theorem but are proven compliant under formal analysis. Thus, these serve as constructive validations that demonstrate the metamodel's expressiveness and correctness in representing operations that may appear to challenge the no-cloning theorem but, upon rigorous analysis, are shown to comply with it. The approach supports early detection of conceptual design errors, promoting correctness prior to implementation. The framework's extensibility is also demonstrated by modeling projective measurement, further reinforcing its applicability to broader quantum software engineering tasks. By integrating the rigor of metamodeling with fundamental quantum mechanical principles, this work provides a structured, model-driven approach that enables traditional software engineers to address quantum computing challenges. It offers practical insights into embedding quantum correctness at the modeling level and advances the development of reliable, error-resilient quantum software systems.

TI Spectral control of nonclassical light pulses using an integrated
   thin-film lithium niobate modulator
SO LIGHT-SCIENCE & APPLICATIONS
AB Manipulating the frequency and bandwidth of nonclassical light is essential for implementing frequency-encoded/ multiplexed quantum computation, communication, and networking protocols, and for bridging spectral mismatch among various quantum systems. However, quantum spectral control requires a strong nonlinearity mediated by light, microwave, or acoustics, which is challenging to realize with high efficiency, low noise, and on an integrated chip. Here, we demonstrate both frequency shifting and bandwidth compression of heralded single-photon pulses using an integrated thin-film lithium niobate (TFLN) phase modulator. We achieve record-high electro-optic frequency shearing of telecom single photons over terahertz range (+/- 641 GHz or +/- 5.2 nm), enabling high visibility quantum interference between frequency-nondegenerate photon pairs. We further operate the modulator as a time lens and demonstrate over eighteen-fold (6.55 nm to 0.35 nm) bandwidth compression of single photons. Our results showcase the viability and promise of on-chip quantum spectral control for scalable photonic quantum information processing.

TI Single photon emitter deterministically coupled to a topological corner
   state
SO LIGHT-SCIENCE & APPLICATIONS
AB Incorporating topological physics into the realm of quantum photonics holds the promise of developing quantum light emitters with inherent topological robustness and immunity to backscattering. Nonetheless, the deterministic interaction of quantum emitters with topologically nontrivial resonances remains largely unexplored. Here we present a single photon emitter that utilizes a single semiconductor quantum dot, deterministically coupled to a second-order topological corner state in a photonic crystal cavity. By investigating the Purcell enhancement of both single photon count and emission rate within this topological cavity, we achieve an experimental Purcell factor of Fp = 3.7. Furthermore, we demonstrate the on-demand emission of polarized single photons, with a second-order autocorrelation function g(2)(0) as low as 0.024 +/- 0.103. Our approach facilitates the customization of light-matter interactions in topologically nontrivial environments, thereby offering promising applications in the field of quantum photonics.
   We achieve the first deterministic coupling of a topological corner state with a single quantum dot, observing Purcell enhancement and polarized single-photon emission. This extends the effect of higher-order topological phase into the quantum realm.

TI Solving k-SAT problems with generalized quantum measurement
SO NPJ QUANTUM INFORMATION
AB We generalize the projection-based quantum measurement-driven k-SAT algorithm of Benjamin, Zhao, and Fitzsimons1 to arbitrary strength quantum measurements, including the limit of continuous monitoring. In doing so, we clarify that this algorithm is a particular case of the measurement-driven quantum control strategy elsewhere referred to as "Zeno dragging". We argue that the algorithm is most efficient with finite time and measurement resources in the continuum limit, where measurements have an infinitesimal strength and duration. Moreover, for solvable k-SAT problems, the dynamics generated by the algorithm converge deterministically towards target dynamics in the long-time (Zeno) limit, implying that the algorithm can successfully operate autonomously via Lindblad dissipation, without detection. We subsequently study both the conditional and unconditional dynamics of the algorithm implemented via generalized measurements, quantifying the advantages of detection for heralding errors. These strategies are investigated first in a computationally-trivial 2-qubit 2-SAT problem to build intuition, and then we consider the scaling of the algorithm on 3-SAT problems encoded with 4-10 qubits. We numerically investigate the scaling of 3-SAT with respect to algorithmic runtime and find that the optimized time to solution scales with qubit number n as lambda n, where lambda is slightly larger than 2\documentclass[12pt]{minimal} \usepackage{amsmath} \usepackage{wasysym} \usepackage{amsfonts} \usepackage{amssymb} \usepackage{amsbsy} \usepackage{mathrsfs} \usepackage{upgreek} \setlength{\oddsidemargin}{-69pt} \begin{document}$$\sqrt{2}$$\end{document} for unconditional dynamics and less than 2\documentclass[12pt]{minimal} \usepackage{amsmath} \usepackage{wasysym} \usepackage{amsfonts} \usepackage{amssymb} \usepackage{amsbsy} \usepackage{mathrsfs} \usepackage{upgreek} \setlength{\oddsidemargin}{-69pt} \begin{document}$$\sqrt{2}$$\end{document} for conditional dynamics.

AB In this paper, we study the hulls of ZpZp[v]- cyclic codes for any prime p, where v2 = v. Firstly, we derive the generator polynomials of the hulls of separable cyclic codes (SCCs) over ZpZp[v] and determine their dimensions using the concept of a generating function in combinatorics. We also enumerate the SCCs over ZpZp[v] with hulls of a fixed dimension. Next, we present the generator polynomials of the hulls of non-separable cyclic codes (NSCCs) over Z2Z2[v] with coprime odd block lengths and determine their dimensions. Additionally, we enumerate the NSCCs over Z2Z2[v] with hulls of a fixed dimension. As an application, we use the hulls of NSCCs over Z2Z2[v] to construct some good entanglement-assisted quantum error-correcting codes (EAQECCs).

TI Optimizing population accumulation in a designated single Zeeman state
   using microwave spectroscopy
SO OPTICS CONTINUUM
AB We present an all-optical method for the highly efficient preparation of cold atoms in a specific Zeeman state, such as the magnetically insensitive clock state (mF = 0) or a particular state suitable for quantum information processing and storage. This technique employs a single microwave spectrum, enabling precise determination of the population distribution, microwave polarization ratio, and microwave Rabi frequency individually. By analyzing the microwave spectrum, we can track the population distribution while systematically varying the power or period of the optical pumping field(s). In steady-state conditions, our simplified model, which incorporates resonant and off-resonant transitions, reveals an upper limit to the population purity. Through the optimization of the intensity and polarization of the optical pumping field, we have achieved exceptional population purities of up to 96(2)% or 98(1)% for the desired quantum state. These remarkable results indicate a significant advancement in state preparation accuracy. Our all-optical method introduces an approach to achieving high-purity atomic states while employing novel microwave spectroscopy to accurately detect all unknown parameters, offering valuable insights and potential applications in precision measurement and quantum computation research.

Tin is isoelectronic with silicon, so we expect that electrons can easily shuttle from one Sn atom to another to propagate quantum information via a hyperfine interaction that we predict, from all-electron linearized augmented plane-wave density-functional-theory calculations, to be roughly 10 times larger than that of intrinsic 29Si. A hyperfine-induced electron-nuclear controlledphase (e-n-CPhase) gate operation, generated (up to local rotations) by merely holding an electron at a sweet spot of maximum hyperfine strength for a specific duration of time, is predicted to be exceptionally resilient to charge or voltage noise. Diabatic spin flips are suppressed with a modest magnetic field (> 15 mT for < 10-6 flip probabilities) and nuclear-spin-bath noise may be avoided via isotopic enrichment or mitigated using dynamical decoupling or through monitoring and compensation. Combined with magnetic resonance control, this operation enables universal quantum computation.

TI Improvements on Making BKW Practical for Solving LWE
SO CRYPTOGRAPHY
AB The learning with errors (LWE) problem is one of the main mathematical foundations of post-quantum cryptography. One of the main groups of algorithms for solving LWE is the Blum-Kalai-Wasserman (BKW) algorithm. This paper presents new improvements of BKW-style algorithms for solving LWE instances. We target minimum concrete complexity, and we introduce a new reduction step where we partially reduce the last position in an iteration and finish the reduction in the next iteration, allowing non-integer step sizes. We also introduce a new procedure in the secret recovery by mapping the problem to binary problems and applying the fast Walsh Hadamard transform. The complexity of the resulting algorithm compares favorably with all other previous approaches, including lattice sieving. We additionally show the steps of implementing the approach for large LWE problem instances. We provide two implementations of the algorithm, one RAM-based approach that is optimized for speed, and one file-based approach which overcomes RAM limitations by using file-based storage.

TI Holographic duality between local Hamiltonians from random tensor
   networks
SO JOURNAL OF HIGH ENERGY PHYSICS
AB The AdS/CFT correspondence realises the holographic principle where information in the bulk of a space is encoded at its border. We are yet a long way from a full mathematical construction of AdS/CFT, but toy models in the form of holographic quantum error correcting codes (HQECC) have replicated some interesting features of the correspondence. In this work we construct new HQECCs built from random stabilizer tensors that describe a duality between models encompassing local Hamiltonians whilst exactly obeying the Ryu-Takayanagi entropy formula for all boundary regions. We also obtain complementary recovery of local bulk operators for any boundary bipartition. Existing HQECCs have been shown to exhibit these properties individually, whereas our mathematically rigorous toy models capture these features of AdS/CFT simultaneously, advancing further towards a complete construction of holographic duality.

TI A Survey on Exotic Signatures for Post-quantum Blockchain: Challenges
   and Research Directions
SO ACM COMPUTING SURVEYS
AB Blockchain technology provides efficient and secure solutions to various online activities by utilizing a wide range of cryptographic tools. In this article, we survey the existing literature on post-quantum secure digital signatures that possess exotic advanced features and that are crucial cryptographic tools used in the blockchain ecosystem for (1) account management, (2) consensus efficiency, (3) empowering scriptless blockchain, and (4) privacy. The exotic signatures that we particularly focus on in this work are the following: multi-/aggregate, threshold, adaptor, blind, and ring signatures. Herein the term "exotic" refers to signatures with properties that are not just beyond the norm for signatures, e.g., unforgeability, but also imbue new forms of functionalities. Our treatment of such exotic signatures includes discussions on existing challenges and future research directions in the post-quantum space. We hope that this article will help to foster further research to make post-quantum cryptography more accessible so that blockchain systems can be made ready in advance of the approaching quantum threats.

TI Decoherence and Wave-Function Deformation of D4 Non-Abelian
   Topological Order
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW X
AB The effect of decoherence on topological order (TO) has been most deeply understood for the toric code, the paragon of Abelian TOs. We show that certain non-Abelian TOs can be analyzed and understood to a similar degree, despite being significantly richer. We consider both wave-function deformations and quantum channels acting on D4 TO, which has recently been realized on a quantum processor. By identifying the corresponding local statistical mechanical spin or rotor model with D4 symmetry, we find a remarkable stability against proliferating non-Abelian anyons. This is shown by leveraging a reformulation in terms of the tractable O(2) loop model in the pure state case and n coupled O(2) loop models for Re<acute accent>nyi-n quantities in the decoherence case-corresponding to worldlines of the proliferating anyon with quantum dimension 2. In particular, we find that the purity (n 1/4 2) remains deep in the D4 TO for any decoherence strength, while the n-* infinity limit becomes critical upon maximally decohering a particular anyon type, similar to our wave-function deformation result. The information-theoretic threshold (n-* 1) appears to be controlled by a disordered version of these statistical mechanical models, akin to the toric code case although significantly more robust. We furthermore use Monte Carlo simulations to explore the phase diagrams when multiple anyon types proliferate at the same time, leading to a continued stability of the D4 TO in addition to critical phases with emergent U(1) symmetry. Instead of loop models, these are now described by net models corresponding to different anyon types coupled together according to fusion rules. This opens up the exploration of statistical mechanical models for decohered non-Abelian TO, which can inform optimal decoders and which in an ungauged formulation provides examples of non-Abelian strong-to-weak symmetry breaking.

TI Enhancing the performance of entanglement-based WDM-QKD
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB Entanglement-based quantum key distribution (EB-QKD) is considered an important implementation method for fully connected quantum networks. Due to practical considerations for conserving fiber resources, the demand for integrating EB-QKD into existing optical networks through wavelength-division multiplexing (WDM) in the same fiber (referred to as EB-WDM-QKD) is increasingly urgent. However, the noise generated from the classical system is an inherent limitation that restricts the performance of EB-WDM-QKD. In this work, we proposed an improved scheme that employs optical amplifiers to enhance the performance of EB-WDM-QKD. Under the fixed classical received power scenario, the transmission distance can be increased by more than 70 km compared to the original EB-WDM-QKD scheme without amplifiers. Moreover, for the scenario where the launch power of data lasers and amplifiers in the classical channel is non-adjustable, we applied the advantage distillation (AD) method to further enhance the performance of EB-WDM-QKD, and the transmission distance can be enhanced by more than 50 km. Our work can significantly enhance the performance of the EB-WDM-QKD system by optimizing the configuration of the classical subsystem and the post-processing of the quantum subsystem. The methods have the potential to be extended to various WDM-QKD systems, providing new perspectives for the advancement of WDM-QKD.

TI Black hole information recovery in JT gravity
SO JOURNAL OF HIGH ENERGY PHYSICS
AB We consider the issue of information recovery for an object carrying energy and entropy into a black hole using the generalized entropy formalism, in the context of JT gravity where the backreaction problem can be solved exactly. We verify the main aspects of the Hayden-Preskill scenario but with some refinements. We show that the information is encoded in the Hawking radiation in a redundant way, as expected for a quantum error correcting code. We show how quantum extremal surfaces associated to information recovery have the form of a python's lunch and thereby show that the complexity of decoding is exponential in a combination of the entropy shift of the black hole and the entropy of the object. We also show that an infalling observer must have a smooth experience at the horizon and we calculate their endurance proper time inside the black hole before they are radiated out.

TI TLERAD: Transfer Learning for Enhanced Ransomware Attack Detection
SO CMC-COMPUTERS MATERIALS & CONTINUA
AB Ransomware has emerged as a critical cybersecurity threat, characterized by its ability to encrypt user data or lock devices, demanding ransom for their release. Traditional ransomware detection methods face limitations due to their assumption of similar data distributions between training and testing phases, rendering them less effective against evolving ransomware families. This paper introduces TLERAD (Transfer Learning for Enhanced Ransomware Attack Detection), a novel approach that leverages unsupervised transfer learning and co-clustering techniques to bridge the gap between source and target domains, enabling robust detection of both known and unknown ransomware variants. The proposed method achieves high detection accuracy, with an AUC of 0.98 for known ransomware and 0.93 for unknown ransomware, significantly outperforming baseline methods. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate TLERAD's effectiveness in real-world scenarios, highlighting its adaptability to the rapidly evolving ransomware landscape. The paper also discusses future directions for enhancing TLERAD, including real-time adaptation, integration with lightweight and post-quantum cryptography, and the incorporation of explainable AI techniques.

TI Detecting telecom single photons with
   (99.5+0.5-2.07)% system detection efficiency and
   high time resolution
SO APL PHOTONICS
AB Single photon detectors are indispensable tools in optics, from fundamental measurements to quantum information processing. The ability of superconducting nanowire single photon detectors (SNSPDs) to detect single photons with unprecedented efficiency, short dead time, and high time resolution over a large frequency range enabled major advances in quantum optics. However, combining near-unity system detection efficiency (SDE) with high timing performance remains an outstanding challenge. In this work, we fabricated novel SNSPDs on membranes with 99.5-(2.07)(+0.5)% SDE at 1350 nm with 32 ps timing jitter (using a room-temperature amplifier), and other detectors in the same batch showed 94%-98% SDE at 1260-1625 nm with 15-26 ps timing jitter (using cryogenic amplifiers). The SiO2/Au membrane enables broadband absorption in small SNSPDs, offering high detection efficiency in combination with high timing performance. With low-noise cryogenic amplifiers operated in the same cryostat, our efficient detectors reach a timing jitter in the range of 15-26 ps. We discuss the prime challenges in optical design, device fabrication, and accurate and reliable detection efficiency measurements to achieve high performance single photon detection. As a result, the fast developing fields of quantum information science, quantum metrology, infrared imaging, and quantum networks will greatly benefit from this far-reaching quantum detection technology.

TI Experimental spatial-spectral allocation for quantum-classical
   coexistence over multicore fiber
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB The convergence of quantum key distribution (QKD) with classical optical networks represents a pivotal advancement in secure communication technologies. This paper presents an experimental investigation of a resource allocation framework for co-transmitting QKD and classical signals through multicore fiber (MCF). We first analyze theoretical model characterizing inter-core noise interference mechanisms between classical and quantum channels over MCF. Building on this analysis, a noise-aware spatial-spectral resource allocation scheme is proposed, coordinating resources across two dimensions: core allocation via a Cartesian coordinate-based hierarchy ensures universal compatibility with arbitrary MCF configurations, while adaptive wavelength assignment dynamically suppresses single or dual noise sources. Experimental validation demonstrates the scheme's superior noise suppression capabilities and enhanced secure key rates compared to benchmark approaches, achieving reductions of 4.2 dB in noise photons and improvements of 10 kbps in secure key rate. This work establishes a practical foundation for implementing QKD networks within existing fiber infrastructure, advancing the realization of scalable quantum-classical coexistance.

We adopt three principles for the generalization: the first two are to ensure that the games are compatible with quantum computer and the third is to ensure that the standard classical games are the special cases. We demonstrate how to construct basic quantum moves and use them to set up quantum games. There are three different schemes to play the quantized games: one quantum computer with another quantum computer (QwQ), two classical computer playing with each other on one quantum computer (CQC), and one classical computer with another classical computer (CwC). We illustrate these results with the games of Five in a Row and Weiqi.

TI Wigner-negative states in the steady-state emission of a two-level
   system driven by squeezed light
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Propagating modes of light with Wigner distributions exhibiting negativity are of fundamental interest in quantum optics and represent a key resource in the pursuit of optics-based quantum information technologies. Most schemes proposed or implemented for the generation of such modes are probabilistic in nature and rely on heralding by detection of a photon or on conditional methods where photons are separated from the original field mode by a beam splitter. We demonstrate theoretically, using a cascaded-quantum-system model, the possibility of deterministic generation of Wigner negativity in temporal modes of the steady-state emission of a two-level system driven by finite-bandwidth quadrature-squeezed light. Optimal negativity is obtained for a squeezing bandwidth similar to the linewidth of the transition of the two-level system. While the Wigner distribution associated with the incident squeezed light is Gaussian and everywhere positive, the Wigner functions of the outgoing temporal modes show distinct similarities and overlap with a superposition of displaced squeezed states.

SO INDIAN JOURNAL OF PURE & APPLIED PHYSICS
AB We report a new gateway towards the light-matter interaction of spontaneous emission from a quantum emitter (QE) in optical nanofiber (ONF) based on nanocavities tilted by some angle with respect to the plane of the fiber cross-section. This structure is designed by three-dimensional finite-difference time-domain simulations to enhance the spontaneous emission decay rate from a QE and maximize the coupling efficiency into the fiber-guided modes. Here, we systematically analyzed the polarization-dependent spontaneous emission characteristics of QE and cavity characteristics of the proposed structure. We show that the coupling efficiency from single emitters can reach as high as similar to 90% with the Purcell factor can be as high as & SIM; 65. The results show a 10-fold enhancement factor from a QE in the cavity center compared with the cavity surface. The tilted angle can be optimized to get more transmission and coupling efficiency. This tilted structure has a high Q-factor of similar to 1000 and a low mode volume of similar to 0.56 .m(3), with a maximum degree of polarization of the single photons has been calculated as high as 96%. For the quantum information and quantum photonics application, this system attracts researchers to a new direction in the quantum world.

TI Lower bound on the spread of valley splitting in Si/SiGe quantum wells
   induced by atomic rearrangement at the interface
SO CHINESE PHYSICS B
AB The achievement of universal quantum computing critically relies on scalability. However, ensuring the necessary uniformity for scalable silicon electron spin qubits poses a significant challenge due to the considerable fluctuations in valley splitting energy (E VS) across quantum dot arrays, which impede the initialization of qubit systems comprising multiple spins and give rise to spin-valley entanglement resulting in the loss of spin information. These E VS fluctuations have been attributed to variations in the in-plane averaged alloy concentration along the confinement direction of Si/SiGe quantum wells. In this study, employing atomistic pseudopotential calculations, we unveil a significant spectrum of E VS even in the absence of such concentration fluctuations. This spectrum represents the lower limit of the wide range of E VS observed in numerous Si/SiGe quantum devices. By constructing simplified interface atomic step models, we analytically demonstrate that the lower bound of the E VS spread originates from the in-plane random distribution of Si and Ge atoms within SiGe barriers - an inherent characteristic that has been previously overlooked. Additionally, we propose an interface engineering approach to mitigate the in-plane randomness-induced fluctuations in E VS by inserting a few monolayers of pure Ge barrier at the Si/SiGe interface. Our findings provide valuable insights into the critical role of in-plane randomness in determining E VS in Si/SiGe quantum devices and offer reliable methods to enhance the feasibility of scalable Si-based spin qubits.

TI Testing a Quantum Annealer as a Quantum Thermal Sampler
SO ACM TRANSACTIONS ON QUANTUM COMPUTING
AB Motivated by recent experiments in which specific thermal properties of complex many-body systems were successfully reproduced on a commercially available quantum annealer, we examine the extent to which quantum annealing hardware can reliably sample from the thermal state in a specific basis associated with a target quantum Hamiltonian. We address this question by studying the diagonal thermal properties of the canonical one-dimensional transverse-field Ising model on a D-Wave 2000Q quantum annealing processor. We find that the quantum processor fails to produce the correct expectation values predicted by Quantum Monte Carlo. Comparing to master equation simulations, we find that this discrepancy is best explained by how the measurements at finite transverse fields are enacted on the device. Specifically, measurements at finite transverse field require the system to be quenched from the target Hamiltonian to a Hamiltonian with negligible transverse field, and this quench is too slow. The limitations imposed by such hardware make it an unlikely candidate for thermal sampling, and it remains an open question what thermal expectation values can be robustly estimated in general for arbitrary quantum many-body systems.

Moreover, we calculate explicitly the analytic expressions of the alpha-concurrence for isotropic states and Werner states.

TI On the Construction of Quantum and LCD Codes from Cyclic Codes over the
   Finite Commutative Rings
SO AXIOMS
AB Let F-q be a field of order q, where q is a power of an odd prime p, and alpha and beta are two non-zero elements of F-q. The primary goal of this article is to study the structural properties of cyclic codes over a finite ring R = F-q[u(1), u(2)]/(u(1)(2) - alpha(2), u(2)(2) - beta(2), u(1)u(2)- u(2)u(1)). We decompose the ring R by using orthogonal idempotents Delta(1), Delta(2), Delta(3), and Delta(4) as R = Delta R-1 circle plus Delta R-2 circle plus Delta R-3 circle plus Delta R-4, and to construct quantum-error-correcting (QEC) codes over R. As an application, we construct some optimal LCD codes.

TI Two Families of Entanglement-Assisted Quantum MDS Codes from Cyclic
   Codes
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF THEORETICAL PHYSICS
AB With entanglement-assisted (EA) formalism, arbitrary classical linear codes are allowed to transform into EAQECCs by using pre-shared entanglement between the sender and the receiver. In this paper, based on classical cyclic MDS codes by exploiting pre-shared maximally entangled states, we construct two families of q-ary entanglement-assisted quantum MDS codes [[q(2)+1 a; q(2)+1 a -2 d-1+c; d]]; chh ii, where q is a prime power in the form of am + l, and a = (l(2) + 1) or a = (l(2) +1)/5. We show that all of q-ary EAQMDS have minimum distance upper limit much larger than the known quantum MDS (QMDS) codes of the same length. Most of these q-ary EAQMDS codes are new in the sense that their parameters are not covered by the codes available in the literature.

TI Entanglement-assisted variational algorithm for discrete optimization
   problems
SO COMMUNICATIONS PHYSICS
AB From fundamental sciences to economics and industry, discrete optimization problems are ubiquitous. Yet, their complexity often renders exact solutions intractable, necessitating the use of approximate methods. Heuristics inspired by classical physics have long played a central role in this domain. More recently, quantum annealing has emerged as a promising alternative, with hardware implementations realized on both analog and digital quantum devices. Here, we develop a heuristic inspired by quantum annealing, using Generalized Coherent States as a parameterized variational Ansatz to represent the quantum state. This framework allows for the analytical computation of energy and gradients with low-degree polynomial complexity, enabling the study of large problems with thousands of spins. Concurrently, these states capture non-trivial entanglement, crucial for the effectiveness of quantum annealing. We benchmark the heuristic on the three-dimensional Edwards-Anderson model and compare the solution quality and runtime of our method to other popular heuristics. Our findings suggest that it offers a scalable way to leverage quantum effects for complex optimization problems, with the potential to complement or improve upon conventional alternatives in large-scale applications.

TI Entanglement scaling behaviors of free fermions on hyperbolic lattices
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Recently, tight-binding models on hyperbolic lattices (discretized anti-de Sitter space) have gained significant attention, leading to hyperbolic band theory and non-Abelian Bloch states. In this paper, we investigate these quantum systems from the perspective of quantum information, focusing particularly on the scaling of entanglement entropy (EE) that has been regarded as a powerful quantum-information probe into exotic phases of matter. It is known that on a d-dimensional translation-invariant Euclidean lattice, the EE of band insulators scales as an area law (<^>Ld-1, where L is the linear size of the boundary between two subsystems). Meanwhile, the EE of metals [with a finite density of state (DOS)] scales as the renowned Gioev-Klich-Widom scaling law (<^>Ld-1 ln L). The appearance of logarithmic divergence, as well as the analytic form of the coefficient c, is mathematically controlled by the Widom conjecture of asymptotic behavior of Toeplitz matrices and can be physically understood via the Swingle's argument. However, the hyperbolic lattice, which generalizes translational symmetry, results in the inapplicability of these analytic approaches and the potential nontrivial behavior of the EE. Here we make an initial attempt through numerical simulation. Remarkably, we find that both cases adhere to the area law, indicating the effect of background hyperbolic geometry that influences quantum entanglement. To achieve the results, we first apply the vertex-inflation method to generate a hyperbolic lattice on the Poincar & eacute; disk, and then apply the Haydock recursion method to compute the DOS. Finally, we study the scaling of the EE for different bipartitions via exact diagonalization and perform finite-size scaling. We also investigate how the coefficient of the area law is correlated to the bulk gap in the gapped case and to the DOS in the gapless case, respectively. Future directions are discussed.

TI Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Formulation for Traffic Signal
   Optimization on Real-World Maps
SO JOURNAL OF THE PHYSICAL SOCIETY OF JAPAN
AB The D-Wave quantum annealing machine can quickly find the optimal solution for quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO). One of the applications where the use of quantum annealing is desired is in problems requiring rapid calculations. One such application is the traffic signal optimization. Several studies have used quantum annealing; however, they are formulated in relatively unrealistic settings, such as only crossroads on a map. We propose a different formulation of QUBO that can also deal with T-junctions and multi-forked roads. The simulation of urban mobility (SUMO) was used to validate the efficiency of our approach and verify the feasibility of real-time control using geographical information data that were very similar to the real world. Our model could reduce the waiting time at red lights for vehicles. In addition, we compared our results with those of the Gurobi Optimizer to confirm whether the DWave machine could find the ground state. Unfortunately, our results show that the D-Wave machine could not find the optimal solution and was slower than the Gurobi Optimizer in computation time.

TI Travel time optimization on multi-AGV routing by reverse annealing
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB Quantum annealing has been actively researched since D-Wave Systems produced the first commercial machine in 2011. Controlling a large fleet of automated guided vehicles is one of the real-world applications utilizing quantum annealing. In this study, we propose a formulation to control the traveling routes to minimize the travel time. We validate our formulation through simulation in a virtual plant and authenticate the effectiveness for faster distribution compared to a greedy algorithm that does not consider the overall detour distance. Furthermore, we utilize reverse annealing to maximize the advantage of the D-Wave's quantum annealer. Starting from relatively good solutions obtained by a fast greedy algorithm, reverse annealing searches for better solutions around them. Our reverse annealing method improves the performance compared to standard quantum annealing alone and performs up to 10 times faster than a commercial classical solver, Gurobi. This study extends a use of optimization with general problem solvers in the application of multi-AGV systems and reveals the potential of reverse annealing as an optimizer.

TI Error-mitigated quantum metrology via enhanced virtual purification
SO COMMUNICATIONS PHYSICS
AB Quantum metrology stands as a leading application of quantum science and technology, yet noise often constrains its precision and sensitivity. In near-term quantum metrology, existing protocols largely depend on virtual state purification, but significant noise accumulation and additional noise from the implementations of these protocols can impede their effectiveness. We propose enhanced virtual channel purification to address these problems, yielding enhanced virtual state purification as a by-product. Within sequential quantum metrology schemes, our error analysis reveals substantial bias reduction and quantum advantages in sampling cost when the number of encoding channels is O(p-1)\documentclass[12pt]{minimal} \usepackage{amsmath} \usepackage{wasysym} \usepackage{amsfonts} \usepackage{amssymb} \usepackage{amsbsy} \usepackage{mathrsfs} \usepackage{upgreek} \setlength{\oddsidemargin}{-69pt} \begin{document}$${\mathcal{O}}({p}<<^>>{-1})$$\end{document}, where p represents the error rate of encoding channels. In this range, our methods demonstrate significant improvements in parameter estimation precision and robustness against practical noise, as evidenced by numerical simulations for both single- and multi-parameter tasks. Particularly, these methods can naturally extend beyond quantum metrology, indicating their broad applicability in quantum information and quantum computation.

TI Non-Gaussian-state generation with time-gated photon detection
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Non-Gaussian states of light, which are essential in fault-tolerant and universal optical quantum computation, are typically generated by a heralding scheme using photon detectors. Recently, it has been theoretically shown that the large timing jitter of the photon detectors deteriorates the purity of the generated non-Gaussian states [T. Sonoyama et al., Phys. Rev. A 105, 043714 (2022)]. Here, we circumvent this problem by time-gated photon detection and generate non-Gaussian states with Wigner negativity using continuous-wave light. We use a fast optical switch for time gating to effectively improve the timing jitter of a photon-number-resolving detector based on a transition edge sensor from 50 ns to 10 ns. As a result, we generate non-Gaussian states with Wigner negativity of -0.011 +/- 0.004 (h over bar = 1), which cannot be observed without the time-gated photon detection method. These results confirm the effect of the timing jitter on non-Gaussian state generation experimentally for the first time. The proposed time-gated photon detection method would be useful for high-purity non-Gaussian state preparation in optical quantum information processing.

TI Cooling microwave fields into general multimode Gaussian states
SO NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB We show that a collection of lossy multichromatic modulated qubits can be used to dissipatively engineer arbitrary Gaussian states of a set of bosonic modes. Our ideas are especially suited to superconducting-circuit architectures, where all the required ingredients are experimentally available. The generation of such multimode Gaussian states is necessary for many applications, most notably measurement-based quantum computation. We build upon some of our previous proposals, where we showed how to generate single-mode and two-mode squeezed states through cooling and lasing. Special care must be taken when extending these proposals to many bosonic modes, and we discuss here how to overcome all the limitations and hurdles that naturally appear. For the sake of illustration, we work out two examples of Gaussian-state families consisting of Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger and cluster states, which allow us to show that it is possible to use a set of N lossy qubits to cool down a bosonic chain of N modes to any desired Gaussian state.

TI Quasiparticle excitations in a one-dimensional interacting topological
   insulator: Application for dopant-based quantum simulation
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
AB We study the effects of electron-electron interactions on the charge excitation spectrum of the spinful SuSchrieffer-Heeger (SSH) model, a prototype of a one-dimensional bulk obstructed topological insulator. In view of recent progress in the fabrication of dopant-based quantum simulators we focus on experimentally detectable signatures of interacting topology in finite lattices. To this end we use Lanczos-based exact diagonalization to calculate the single-particle spectral function in real space which generalizes the local density of states to interacting systems. Its spatial and spectral resolution allows for the direct investigation and identification of edge states. By studying the noninteracting limit, we demonstrate that the topological in-gap states on the boundary are robust against both finite-size effects as well as random bond and onsite disorder which suggests the feasibility of simulating the SSH model in engineered dopant arrays in silicon. While edge excitations become zero-energy spinlike for any finite interaction strength, our analysis of the spectral function shows that the single-particle charge excitations are gapped out on the boundary. Despite the loss of topological protection, we find that these edge excitations are quasiparticlelike as long as they remain within the bulk gap. Above a critical interaction strength of Uc approximate to 5t these quasiparticles on the boundary lose their coherence which is explained by the merging of edge and bulk states. This is in contrast to the many-body edge excitations which survive the limit of strong coupling, as established in the literature. Our findings show that for moderate repulsive interactions the nontrivial phase of the interacting SSH model can be detected through remnant signatures of topological single-particle states using single-particle local measurement techniques such as scanning tunneling spectroscopy.

TI Spin-Variable Reduction Method for Handling Linear Equality Constraints
   in Ising Machines
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON COMPUTERS
AB We propose a spin-variable reduction method for Ising machines to handle linear equality constraints in a combinatorial optimization problem. Ising machines including quantum-annealing machines can effectively solve combinatorial optimization problems. They are designed to find the lowest-energy solution of a quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO), which is mapped from the combinatorial optimization problem. The proposed method reduces the number of binary variables to formulate the QUBO compared to the conventional penalty method. We demonstrate a sufficient condition to obtain the optimum of the combinatorial optimization problem in the spin-variable reduction method and its general applicability. We apply it to typical combinatorial optimization problems, such as the graph $k$k-partitioning problem and the quadratic assignment problem. Experiments using simulated-annealing and quantum-annealing based Ising machines demonstrate that the spin-variable reduction method outperforms the penalty method. The proposed method extends the application of Ising machines to larger-size combinatorial optimization problems with linear equality constraints.

TI Manipulating Growth and Propagation of Correlations in Dipolar
   Multilayers: From Pair Production to Bosonic Kitaev Models
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB We study the nonequilibrium dynamics of dipoles confined in multiple stacked two-dimensional layers realizing a long-range interacting quantum spin 1/2 XXX model. We demonstrate that strong in-plane interactions can protect a manifold of collective layer dynamics. This then allows us to map the many-body spin dynamics to bosonic models. In a bilayer configuration we show how to engineer the paradigmatic two-mode squeezing Hamiltonian known from quantum optics, resulting in exponential production of entangled pairs and generation of metrologically useful entanglement from initially prepared product states. In multilayer configurations we engineer a bosonic variant of the Kitaev model displaying chiral propagation along the layer direction. Our study illustrates how the control over interactions, lattice geometry, and state preparation in interacting dipolar systems uniquely afforded by AMO platforms such as Rydberg and magnetic atoms, polar molecules, or trapped ions allows for the control over the temporal and spatial propagation of correlations for applications in quantum sensing and quantum simulation.

TI Multimode character of quantum states released from a superconducting
   cavity
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Quantum state transfer by propagating wave packets of electromagnetic radiation requires tunable couplings between the sending and receiving quantum systems and the propagation channel or waveguide. The highest fidelity of state transfer in experimental demonstrations so far has been in superconducting circuits. Here, the tunability always comes together with nonlinear interactions, arising from the same Josephson junctions that enable the tunability. The resulting nonlinear dynamics correlates the photon number and spatiotemporal degrees of freedom and leads to a multimode output state, for any multiphoton state. In this work, we study as a generic example the release of complex quantum states from a superconducting resonator, employing a flux tunable coupler to engineer and control the release process. We quantify the multimode character of the output state and discuss how to optimize the fidelity of a quantum state transfer process with this in mind.

AB Arithmetic to Boolean masking (A2B) conversion is a crucial technique in the masking of lattice-based post-quantum cryptography. It is also a crucial part of building a masked comparison which is one of the hardest to mask building blocks for active secure lattice-based encryption. We first present a new method, called one-hot conversion, to efficiently convert from higher-order arithmetic masking to Boolean masking using a variant of the higher-order table-based conversion of Coron et al. Secondly, we specialize our method to perform arithmetic to 1-bit Boolean functions. Our one-hot function can be applied to masking lattice-based encryption building blocks such as masked comparison or to determine the most significant bit of an arithmetically masked variable. In our benchmarks on a Cortex M4 processor, a speedup of 15 times is achieved over state-of-the-art table-based A2B conversions, bringing table-based A2B conversions within the performance range of the Boolean circuit-based A2B conversions.

TI Post-Quantum Migration of the Tor Application
SO JOURNAL OF CYBERSECURITY AND PRIVACY
AB The efficiency of Shor's and Grover's algorithms and the advancement of quantum computers implies that the cryptography used until now to protect one's privacy is potentially vulnerable to retrospective decryption, also known as the harvest now, decrypt later attack in the near future. This dissertation proposes an overview of the cryptographic schemes used by Tor, highlighting the non-quantum-resistant ones and introducing theoretical performance assessment methods of a local Tor network. The measurement is divided into three phases. We start with benchmarking a local Tor network simulation on constrained devices to isolate the time taken by classical cryptography processes. Secondly, the analysis incorporates existing benchmarks of quantum-secure algorithms and compares these performances on the devices. Lastly, the estimation of overhead is calculated by replacing the measured times of traditional cryptography with the times recorded for Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC) execution within the specified Tor environment. By focusing on the replaceable cryptographic components, using theoretical estimations, and leveraging existing benchmarks, valuable insights into the potential impact of PQC can be obtained without needing to implement it fully.

TI Effect of closely-spaced excited states on electromagnetically induced
   transparency
SO OSA CONTINUUM
AB Electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT) is a well-known phenomenon due in part to its applicability to quantum devices such as quantum memories and quantum gates. EIT is commonly modeled with a three-level lambda system; however, this simplified model does not capture all the physics of EIT experiments with real systems. We present a theoretical study of the effect of two closely-spaced excited states on EIT and off-resonance Raman transitions. In addition to the expected broadening of the EIT resonance and reduction in EIT transparency due to multiple excited states, we find some unexpected and interesting results. A comparison with a model that does not allow for coupling of the excited states shows that the coherent interaction of the fields with two excited states whose separation is smaller than their Doppler broadened linewidth can enhance the EIT transparency under some conditions and can enhance and shift the resonance frequency of off-resonance Raman absorption. Furthermore, through a dressed state analysis of the full four-level system, we find that the underlying mechanism for the reduction in EIT transparency is a shift in the two-photon resonance due to unequal dipole moments of the transitions coupled by the control field. Complete transparency can only be recovered for systems with equal dipole moments or when the separation between the two excited states is at least of the order of the Doppler width. To support our theoretical study, we present experimental EIT measurements in the D1 lines of Rb-85 and (87) Rb that agree with our predictions of an enhancement or reduction of EIT transparency under specific conditions. The experimental results also verify the roles that the dipole moments and the separation between the two excited states have on recovering the EIT transparency.

TI Quantum efficiency of the B-center in hexagonal boron nitride
SO NANOPHOTONICS
AB B-centers in hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) are gaining significant research interest for quantum photonics applications due to precise emitter positioning and highly reproducible emission wavelengths at 436 nm. Here, we leverage the layered nature of hBN to directly measure the quantum efficiency (QE) of single B-centers. The defects were engineered in a 35 nm flake of hBN using electron beam irradiation, and the local dielectric environment was altered by transferring a 250 nm hBN flake on top of the one containing the emitters. By analyzing the resulting change in measured lifetimes, we determined the QE of B-centers in the thin flake of hBN. Additionally, we propose two approaches to quantify the QE of B-centers in thick flakes of hBN. Our results indicate that B-centers located in thin flakes can exhibit QEs higher than 40 %. Near-unity QEs are achievable under reasonable Purcell enhancement for emitters embedded in thick flakes of hBN, highlighting their promise for quantum photonics applications.

TI Entanglement and entropy in multipartite systems: a useful approach
SO QUANTUM INFORMATION PROCESSING
AB Quantum entanglement and quantum entropy are crucial concepts in the study of multipartite quantum systems. In this work, we show how the notion of concurrence vector, re-expressed in a particularly useful form, provides new insights and computational tools for the analysis of both. In particular, using this approach for a general multipartite pure state, one can easily prove known relations in an easy way and to build up new relations between the concurrences associated with the different bipartitions. The approach is also useful to derive sufficient conditions for genuine entanglement in generic multipartite systems that are computable in polynomial time. From an entropy-of-entanglement perspective, the approach is powerful to prove properties of the Tsallis-2 entropy, such as the subadditivity, and to derive new ones, e.g., a modified version of the strong subadditivity which is always fulfilled; thanks to the purification theorem these results hold for any multipartite state, whether pure or mixed.

TI Analyzing IND-CPA Security of HQC Codes Using k-Nearest Neighbors
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB Hamming Quasi-Cyclic (HQC) codes, recently selected by NIST for post-quantum cryptography standardization, rely on the hardness of the 2-QCSD problem. While typically analyzed through algebraic methods, we apply AI-driven techniques to explore their IND-CPA security, as a complementary, empirical approach to assess potential structure or patterns. Using manifold learning (e.g., Isomap), we reveal geometric structure in high-dimensional embeddings of code instances. We then apply k-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) to assess separability and potential learnability within this space. To scale this analysis, we incorporate Hierarchical Navigable Small World (HNSW) graphs, enabling efficient nearest-neighbor search. Our results suggest that geometric and learning-based techniques may offer new insights into the hardness assumptions of HQC-based cryptography. The findings show that simple classifiers like KNN can achieve non-trivial classification accuracy (e.g., 80%), suggesting potential distributional artifacts in the ciphertext space.

TI Randomized Oblivious Transfer for Secure Multiparty Computation in the
   Quantum Setting
SO ENTROPY
AB Secure computation is a powerful cryptographic tool that encompasses the evaluation of any multivariate function with arbitrary inputs from mutually distrusting parties. The oblivious transfer primitive serves is a basic building block for the general task of secure multi-party computation. Therefore, analyzing the security in the universal composability framework becomes mandatory when dealing with multi-party computation protocols composed of oblivious transfer subroutines. Furthermore, since the required number of oblivious transfer instances scales with the size of the circuits, oblivious transfer remains as a bottleneck for large-scale multi-party computation implementations. Techniques that allow one to extend a small number of oblivious transfers into a larger one in an efficient way make use of the oblivious transfer variant called randomized oblivious transfer. In this work, we present randomized versions of two known oblivious transfer protocols, one quantum and another post-quantum with ring learning with an error assumption. We then prove their security in the quantum universal composability framework, in a common reference string model.

TI Alternant Hydrocarbon Diradicals as Optically Addressable Molecular
   Qubits
SO JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN CHEMICAL SOCIETY
AB High-spin molecules allow for bottom-up qubit design and are promising platforms for magnetic sensing and quantum information science. Optical addressability of molecular electron spins has also been proposed in first-row transition-metal complexes via optically detected magnetic resonance (ODMR) mechanisms analogous to the diamond-nitrogen-vacancy color center. However, significantly less progress has been made on the front of metal-free molecules, which can deliver lower costs and milder environmental impacts. At present, most luminescent open-shell organic molecules are pi-diradicals, but such systems often suffer from poor ground-state open-shell characters necessary to realize a stable ground-state molecular qubit. In this work, we use alternancy symmetry to selectively minimize radical-radical interactions in the ground state, generating pi-systems with high diradical characters. We call them m-dimers, referencing the need to covalently link two benzylic radicals at their meta carbon atoms for the desired symmetry. Through a detailed electronic structure analysis, we find that the excited states of alternant hydrocarbon m-diradicals contain important symmetries that can be used to construct ODMR mechanisms leading to ground-state spin polarization. The molecular parameters are set in the context of a tris(2,4,6-trichlorophenyl)methyl (TTM) radical dimer covalently tethered at the meta position, demonstrating the feasibility of alternant m-diradicals as molecular color centers.

TI Nearly Query-Optimal Classical Shadow Estimation of Unitary Channels
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB Classical shadow estimation (CSE) is a powerful tool for learning the properties of quantum states and quantum processes. Here we consider the CSE task for quantum unitary channels. By querying an unknown unitary channel U multiple times in quantum experiments, the goal is to learn a classical description from which one can accurately predict many different linear properties of the channel, i.e., the expectation values of arbitrary observables measured on the output of U upon arbitrary input states. Based on collective measurements on multiple systems, we propose a query-efficient protocol for this task, whose query complexity has a quadratic advantage over the previous best approach for this problem, and almost saturates the information-theoretic lower bound. To further enhance practicality, we also present a variant protocol using only single-copy measurements, which still offers much better query performance than previous protocols that do not use quantum memory, and can serve as a key subroutine for learning an arbitrary unknown Hamiltonian from dynamics. In addition to linear properties of unitary channels, our protocol can also be applied to simultaneously predict many nonlinear properties, such as out-of-time-ordered correlators.

TI Dynamical generation and transfer of nonclassical states in strongly
   interacting light-matter systems in cavities
SO QUANTUM SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB We propose leveraging strong and ultrastrong light-matter coupling to efficiently generate and exchange nonclassical light and quantum matter states. Two initial conditions are considered: (a) a displaced quadrature-squeezed matter state, and (b) a coherent state in a cavity. In both scenarios, polaritons mediate the dynamical generation and transfer of nonclassical states between light and matter. By monitoring the dynamics of both subsystems, we uncover the emergence of cavity-induced beatings in the collective matter oscillations. The beating period depends on the particle density through the vacuum Rabi splitting and peaks sharply under light-matter resonance conditions. For initial condition (a), nonclassicality is efficiently transferred from matter to photons under strong and ultrastrong coupling. However, for initial condition (b), nonclassical photonic states are generated only in the ultrastrong coupling regime due to the counter-rotating terms, highlighting the advantages of ultrastrong coupling. Furthermore, in the ultrastrong coupling regime, distinctive asymmetries relative to cavity detuning emerge in dynamical observables of both light and matter. The nonclassical photons can be extracted through a semi-transparent cavity mirror, while nonclassical matter states can be detected via time-resolved spectroscopy. This work highlights that polariton states may serve as a tool for dynamically generating and transferring nonclassical states, with potential applications in quantum technology.

TI Bench-Top Cooling of a Microwave Mode Using an Optically Pumped Spin
   Refrigerator
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB We experimentally demonstrate the temporary removal of thermal photons from a microwave mode at 1.45 GHz through its interaction with the spin-polarized triplet states of photo-excited pentacene molecules doped within a p-terphenyl crystal at room temperature. The crystal functions electromagnetically as a narrowband cryogenic load, removing photons from the otherwise room-temperature mode via stimulated absorption. The noise temperature of the microwave mode dropped to 50(-32)(+18) K (as directly inferred by noise-power measurements), while the metal walls of the cavity enclosing the mode remained at room temperature. Simulations based on the same system's behavior as a maser (which could be characterized more accurately) indicate the possibility of the mode's temperature sinking to similar to 10 K (corresponding to similar to 140 microwave photons). These observations, when combined with engineering improvements to deepen the cooling, identify the system as a narrowband yet extremely convenient platform-free of cryogenics, vacuum chambers, and strong magnets-for realizing low-noise detectors, quantum memory, and quantum-enhanced machines (such as heat engines) based on strong spin-photon coupling and entanglement at microwave frequencies.

TI Numerical Simulations on Polarization Quantum Noise Squeezing for
   Ultrashort Solitons in Optical Fiber with Enlarged Mode Field Area
SO PHOTONICS
AB Broadband quantum noise suppression of light is required for many applications, including detection of gravitational waves, quantum sensing, and quantum communication. Here, using numerical simulations, we investigate the possibility of polarization squeezing of ultrashort soliton pulses in an optical fiber with an enlarged mode field area, such as large-mode area or multicore fibers (to scale up the pulse energy). Our model includes the second-order dispersion, Kerr and Raman effects, quantum noise, and optical losses. In simulations, we switch on and switch off Raman effects and losses to find their contribution to squeezing of optical pulses with different durations (0.1-1 ps). For longer solitons, the peak power is lower and a longer fiber is required to attain the same squeezing as for shorter solitons, when Raman effects and losses are neglected. In the full model, we demonstrate optimal pulse duration (similar to 0.4 ps) since losses limit squeezing of longer pulses and Raman effects limit squeezing of shorter pulses.

TI Neural quantum state study of fracton models
SO SCIPOST PHYSICS
AB Fracton models host unconventional topological orders in three and higher dimensions and provide promising candidates for quantum memory platforms. Understanding their robustness against quantum fluctuations is an important task but also poses great challenges due to the lack of efficient numerical tools. In this work, we establish neural quantum states (NQS) as new tools to study phase transitions in these models. Exact and efficient parametrizations are derived for three prototypical fracton codes - the checkerboard and X-cube model, as well as Haah's code - both in terms of a restricted Boltzmann machine (RBM) and a correlation-enhanced RBM. We then adapt the correlation-enhanced RBM architecture to a perturbed checkerboard model and reveal its strong first-order phase transition between the fracton phase and a trivial field- polarizing phase. To this end, we simulate this highly entangled system on lattices of up to 512 qubits with high accuracy, representing a cutting-edge application of variational neural-network methods. In addition, we reproduce the phase transition of the X-cube model previously obtained with quantum Monte Carlo and high-order series expansion methods. Our work demonstrates the remarkable potential of NQS in studying complicated three-dimensional problems and highlights physics-oriented constructions of NQS architectures.

TI Effects of different sea surface wind speeds on performance of quantum
   satellite-to-ship communication
SO ACTA PHYSICA SINICA
AB In the ocean atmosphere boundary layer far from the continent, marine aerosols generally include two types: sea salt aerosols and secondary marine aerosols. The sea salt aerosols, also called sea salt droplets, stay in the atmosphere for a short time. The sea salt aerosols are produced by the splashing of waves caused by sea breeze on the sea surface. Quantum satellite-to-ship communication is one of the important application scenarios of quantum secret communication. The quantum satellite-to-ship communication is an important part of building a global quantum communication network. In the South China Sea, because the change of wind speed will cause a sharp change in the concentration of aerosol particles and the sharp change of the concentration of aerosol particles can change its own extinction characteristics, the change of aerosol extinction characteristics will inevitably lead to a dramatic attenuation of the satellite-to-ship's quantum link performance. However, the research on the relationship between wind speed on the sea surface and quantum satellite satellite-to-ship communication channel parameters has not been carried out so far. In this paper, based on the Gras model of wind speeds on the sea surface and aerosol, the quantitative relationship between wind speed and satellite-to-ship quantum channel error rate, channel capacity and channel average fidelity are established respectively. The simulation results show that when the transmission distance is constant, as the sea surface wind speed increases, the channel bit error rate increases; as the wind speed increases, the channel capacity of quantum satellite satellite-to-ship communication decreases; when the source probability is constant, as the wind speed increases, the average fidelity of the channel shows a decreasing trend. When the wind speeds are 4 m/s and 20 m/s, the oceanic atmospheric channel error rate, channel capacity, and channel average fidelity are respectively 4.62 x 10(-3) and 4.91 x 10(-3), 0.957 and 0.65, 0.999 and 0.974. It can be seen that the wind speed has a significant effect on the performance of maritime quantum communication. Therefore, when quantum communication over the ocean, in order to improve the reliability of communication, the parameters of the system should be adaptively adjusted according to the wind speed.

Hyperfine coupling has a critical influence on molecular qubit properties. While previous studies have exhaustively investigated this phenomenon, a comprehensive understanding of the underlying mechanisms across different systems remains elusive. A benchmark test was performed using DFT to assess which methodology worked best to accurately predict hyperfine coupling constants in molecular qubits predominantly composed of VIV and CuII. We systematically analysed the decomposition of hyperfine coupling and examined how variations in coordination sphere and molecular geometry impact dipolar, isotropic and spin-orbit contributions. By modelling diverse systems, we demonstrate how molecular design can fine-tune hyperfine coupling contributions, either minimising overall interaction or enhancing coupling along specific axes. This study provides useful insights into the structure-property relationships governing hyperfine coupling mechanisms and assesses the accuracy of different choices of density functional, basis sets and relativistic corrections in the prediction of hyperfine coupling constants.

TI Towards quantum computational mechanics
SO COMPUTER METHODS IN APPLIED MECHANICS AND ENGINEERING
AB The advent of quantum computers, operating on entirely different physical principles and abstractions from those of classical digital computers, sets forth a new computing paradigm that can potentially result in game-changing efficiencies and computational performance. Specifically, the ability to simultaneously evolve the state of an entire quantum system leads to quantum parallelism and interference. Despite these prospects, opportunities to bring quantum computing to bear on problems of computational mechanics remain largely unexplored. In this work, we demonstrate how quantum computing can indeed be used to solve representative volume element (RVE) problems in computational homogenisation with polylogarithmic complexity of O ((log N)(c)), compared to O (N (c)) in classical computing. Thus, our quantum RVE solver attains exponential acceleration with respect to classical solvers, bringing concurrent multiscale computing closer to practicality. The proposed quantum RVE solver combines conventional algorithms such as a fixed-point iteration for a homogeneous reference material and the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT). However, the quantum computing reformulation of these algorithms requires a fundamental paradigm shift and a complete rethinking and overhaul of the classical implementation. We employ or develop several techniques, including the Quantum Fourier Transform (QFT), quantum encoding of polynomials, classical piecewise Chebyshev approximation of functions and an auxiliary algorithm for implementing the fixed-point iteration and show that, indeed, an efficient implementation of RVE solvers on quantum computers is possible. We additionally provide theoretical proofs and numerical evidence confirming the anticipated O (log N)(c) complexity of the proposed solver.

TI Quantum Embedded Superstates
SO ADVANCED QUANTUM TECHNOLOGIES
AB Optical supercavity modes (superstates), i.e., hybrid modes emerging from the strong coupling of two modes of an open cavity, can support ultranarrow lines in their scattering spectra associated with quasi bound states in the continuum (quasi-BIC). These modes are of great interest for sensing applications as they enable compact systems with unprecedented sensitivity. However, classical quasi-BIC sensors are fundamentally limited by the shot-noise limit, which may be overcome in quantum sensors. Here, it is shown that a three-level quantum system (e.g., atom, quantum dot, superconducting qubit) can be tailored to support the quantum analog of superstates with an unboundedly narrow emission line. Remarkably, it is demonstrated that the coupling of such a system with a cavity (e.g., plasmonic or dielectric nanoparticle, microcavity, microwave resonator) enables sensing properties with excellent statistical features. The results can be applied to a plethora of quantum platforms, from superconducting circuits to cold atoms and quantum dots, opening exciting opportunities for quantum sensing and computing.

TI Quantum Euler Relation for Local Measurements
SO ENTROPY
AB In classical thermodynamics the Euler relation is an expression for the internal energy as a sum of the products of canonical pairs of extensive and intensive variables. For quantum systems the situation is more intricate, since one has to account for the effects of the measurement back action. To this end, we derive a quantum analog of the Euler relation, which is governed by the information retrieved by local quantum measurements. The validity of the relation is demonstrated for the collective dissipation model, where we find that thermodynamic behavior is exhibited in the weak-coupling regime.

TI Mitigating Security Vulnerabilities in 6G Networks: A Comprehensive
   Analysis of the DMRN Protocol Using SVO Logic and ProVerif
SO APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL
AB The rapid evolution of mobile and optical communication technologies is driving the transition from 5G to 6G networks. This transition inevitably brings about changes in authentication scenarios, as new security demands emerge that go beyond the capabilities of existing frameworks. Therefore, it is necessary to address these evolving requirements and the associated key challenges: ensuring Perfect Forward Secrecy (PFS) to protect communications even if long-term keys are compromised and integrating Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC) techniques to defend against the threats posed by quantum computing. These are essential for both radio and optical communications, which are foundational elements of future 6G infrastructures. The DMRN Protocol, introduced in 2022, represents a major advancement by offering both PFS and PQC while maintaining compatibility with existing 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) standards. Given the looming quantum-era challenges, it is imperative to analyze the protocol's security architecture through formal verification. Accordingly, we formally analyze the DMRN Protocol using SVO logic and ProVerif to assess its effectiveness in mitigating attack vectors, such as malicious or compromised serving networks (SNs) and home network (HN) masquerading. Our research found that the DMRN Protocol has vulnerabilities in key areas such as mutual authentication and key exchange. In light of these findings, our study provides critical insights into the design of secure and quantum-safe authentication protocols for the transition to 6G networks. Furthermore, by identifying the vulnerabilities in and discussing countermeasures to address the DMRN Protocol, this study lays the groundwork for the future standardization of secure 6G Authentication and Key Agreement protocols.

TI Using dark solitons from a Bose-Einstein condensate necklace to imprint
   soliton states in the spectral memory of a free boson gas
SO NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB A possible use of matter-wave dark-soliton crystal produced by a Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) with ring geometry, to store soliton states in the quantum memory of a free boson gas, is explored. A self-defocusing nonlinearity combined with dispersion and the finite size of the BEC, favor the creation of dark-soliton crystals that imprint quantum states with Jacobi elliptic-type soliton wavefunctions in the spectrum of the free boson gas. The problem is formulated by considering the Gross-Pitaevskii equation with a positive scattering length, coupled to a linear Schrodinger equation for the free boson gas. With the help of the matter-wave dark soliton-crystal solution, the spectrum of bound states created in the free boson gas is shown to be determined by the Lame eigenvalue problem. This spectrum consists of quantum states whose wave functions and energy eigenvalues can be unambiguously identified. Among these eigenstates some have their wave functions that are replicas of the generating dark soliton crystal.

While several logic gates can potentially produce phase-flip errors even in such a channel, we propose bias-preserving implementation of S, H, controlled-Z (CZ), and Rz gates. We demonstrate that our scheme improves the computational precision in several tasks such as the time evolution of quantum systems and variational quantum eigensolver.

TI High- and Low-Rank Optimization of SNOVA on ARMv8: From High-Security
   Applications to IoT Efficiency
SO ELECTRONICS
AB The increasing threat of quantum computing to traditional cryptographic systems has prompted intense research into post-quantum schemes. Despite SNOVA's potential for lightweight and secure digital signatures, its performance on embedded devices (e.g., ARMv8 platforms) remains underexplored. This research addresses this gap by presenting the optimal SNOVA implementations on embedded devices. This paper presents a performance-optimized implementation of the SNOVA post-quantum digital signature scheme on ARMv8 processors. SNOVA is a multivariate cryptographic algorithm under consideration in the NIST's additional signature standardization. Our work targets the performance bottlenecks in the SNOVA scheme. Specifically, we employ matrix arithmetic over GF16 and AES-CTR-based pseudorandom number generation by exploiting the NEON SIMD extension and tailoring the computations to the matrix rank. At a low level, we develop rank-specific SIMD kernels for addition and multiplication. Rank 4 matrices (i.e., 16 bytes) are handled using fully vectorized instructions that align with 128-bit-wise registers, while rank 2 matrices (i.e., 4 bytes) are processed in batches of four to ensure full SIMD occupancy. At the high level, core routines such as key generation and signature evaluation are structurally refactored to provide aligned memory layouts for batched execution. This joint optimization across algorithmic layers reduces the overhead and enables seamless hardware acceleration. The resulting implementation supports 12 SNOVA parameter sets and demonstrates substantial efficiency improvements compared to the reference baseline. These results highlight that fine-grained SIMD adaptation is essential for the efficient deployment of multivariate cryptography on modern embedded platforms.

TI Coherent spin dynamics of rare-earth doped crystals in the
   high-cooperativity regime
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
AB Rare-earth doped crystals have long coherence times and the potential to provide quantum interfaces between microwave and optical photons. Such applications benefit from a high cooperativity between the spin ensemble and a microwave cavity-this motivates an increase in the rare-earth ion concentration which in turn impacts the spin coherence lifetime. We measure spin dynamics of two rare-earth spin species, 145Nd and Yb, doped into Y2SiO5 , coupled to a planar microwave resonator in the high-cooperativity regime, in the temperature range 1.2 K to 14 mK. We identify relevant decoherence mechanisms, including instantaneous diffusion arising from resonant spins and temperature-dependent spectral diffusion from impurity electron and nuclear spins in the environment. We explore two methods to mitigate the effects of spectral diffusion in the Yb system in the low-temperature limit, first, using magnetic fields of up to 1 T to suppress impurity spin dynamics and, second, using transitions with low effective g factors to reduce sensitivity to such dynamics. Finally, we demonstrate how the "clock transition" present in the 171Yb system at zero field can be used to increase coherence times up to T2 = 6(1) ms.

TI Non-Markovian decoherence dynamics of strong-coupling hybrid quantum
   systems: A master equation approach
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Based on the experiments [S. Putz et al., Nat. Phys. 10, 720 (2014); Nat. Photonics 11, 36 (2017)] on the hybrid quantum system of a superconducting microwave cavity coupled strongly to an inhomogeneous broadening spin ensemble, we use the exact master equation theory to investigate its non-Markovian decoherence dynamics under external driving fields. In the experiments, the spin ensemble is made of negatively charged nitrogen-vacancy defects in diamond. The exact master equation theory generalizes the fluctuation-dissipation relation and depicts in details the transient non-Markovian decoherence, in which the dissipation (relaxation) and fluctuations (noise or dephasing) dynamics is well described and the non-Markovian memory effect can be well characterized. We study the physical picture of the transient non-Markovian decoherence dynamics and explore how the non-Markovian decoherence induced by the inhomogeneous broadening of the spin ensemble is suppressed in the strong-coupling regime. We also show how the spectral hole burning generates localized bound states for the further decoherence suppression. Furthermore, we investigate the two-time correlations to show the relationships between quantum fluctuations and quantum memory.

TI Tunable quantum dots in monolithic Fabry-Perot microcavities for
   high-performance single-photon sources
SO LIGHT-SCIENCE & APPLICATIONS
AB Cavity-enhanced single quantum dots (QDs) are the main approach towards ultra-high-performance solid-state quantum light sources for scalable photonic quantum technologies. Nevertheless, harnessing the Purcell effect requires precise spectral and spatial alignment of the QDs' emission with the cavity mode, which is challenging for most cavities. Here we have successfully integrated miniaturized Fabry-Perot microcavities with a piezoelectric actuator, and demonstrated a bright single-photon source derived from a deterministically coupled QD within this microcavity. Leveraging the cavity-membrane structures, we have achieved large spectral tunability via strain tuning. On resonance, a high Purcell factor of similar to 9 is attained. The source delivers single photons with simultaneous high extraction efficiency of 0.58, high purity of 0.956(2) and high indistinguishability of 0.922(4). Together with its compact footprint, our scheme facilitates the scalable integration of indistinguishable quantum light sources on-chip, therefore removing a major barrier to the development of solid-state quantum information platforms based on QDs.

TI Accelerated motional cooling with deep reinforcement learning
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Achieving fast cooling of motional modes is a prerequisite for leveraging such bosonic quanta for high-speed quantum information processing. In this Letter, we address the aspect of reducing the time limit for cooling, below that constrained by the conventional sideband cooling techniques, and propose a scheme to apply deep reinforcement learning (DRL) to achieve this. In particular, we have numerically demonstrated how the scheme can be used effectively to accelerate the dynamic motional cooling of a macroscopic magnonic sphere, and how it can be uniformly extended to more complex systems, for example, a tripartite opto-magno-mechanical system, to obtain cooling of the motional mode below the time bound of coherent cooling. While conventional sideband cooling methods do not work beyond the well-known rotating wave approximation (RWA) regimes, our proposed DRL scheme can be applied uniformly to regimes operating within and beyond the RWA, and thus, this offers a new and complete toolkit for rapid control and generation of macroscopic quantum states for application in quantum technologies.

TI Enabling ambient stability and quantum integration of organometallic
   magnonic ferrimagnets via atomic layer encapsulation
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Magnons, the quanta of spin waves in magnetic materials, are promising for hybrid quantum systems by bridging electromagnetic and spin degrees of freedom. The organometallic ferrimagnet vanadium tetracyanoethylene (V[TCNE]x, x approximate to 2) is especially well-suited for quantum magnonics due to its low Gilbert damping and substrate versatility. However, its rapid chemical degradation in ambient conditions hinders practical applications. Incumbent encapsulation methods provide some protection, but are bulky, obscure intrinsic properties of V[TCNE]x, introduce thermal stress at cryogenic temperatures, and complicate microwave device integration. Here, we demonstrate that ultrathin alumina films deposited via low-temperature atomic layer deposition effectively protect V[TCNE]x by preserving its magnetic and magnonic properties following ambient exposure. The sub-100 nm transparent films also enable advanced spectroscopy, magnetometry, and cavity magnonic measurements that reveal the intrinsic properties of V[TCNE]x. This encapsulation strategy advances molecule-based quantum information science by providing a robust route toward scalable, monolithic integration in hybrid quantum technologies.

TI High-efficiency coherent microwave-to-optics conversion via off-resonant
   scattering
SO NATURE PHOTONICS
AB The demonstration of high-resolution quantum-dot LEDs by transfer printing could prove useful for next-generation displays.
   Quantum transducers that can convert quantum signals from the microwave to the optical domain are a crucial optical interface for quantum information technology. Coherent microwave-to-optics conversions have been realized with various physical platforms, but all of them are limited to low efficiencies of less than 50%-the threshold of the no-cloning quantum regime. Here we report coherent microwave-to-optics transduction using Rydberg atoms and off-resonant scattering technique with an efficiency of 82 +/- 2% and a bandwidth of about 1 MHz. The high conversion efficiency is maintained for microwave photons ranging from thousands to about 50, suggesting that our transduction is readily applicable to the single-photon level. Without requiring cavities or aggressive cooling for the quantum ground states, our results would push atomic transducers closer to practical applications in quantum technologies.

TI Fluorescence enabled phonon counting in an erbium-doped
   piezo-optomechanical microcavity
SO NANOPHOTONICS
AB Converting phonons to photons with optomechanical interaction provides a pathway to realize single phonon counting, which is instrumental in the quantum applications of mechanical systems such as entanglement generation, thermometry, and study of macroscopic quantum phenomenon. In this process, the key requirement is high-extinction, narrow-bandwidth, and stable filtering of the parametric optical pump. Here, we propose to lift this necessity by counting fluorescence emission from a rare earth embedded optomechanical cavity. By doing so, we show that an equivalent filtering effect can be achieved due to spectral hole burning and cavity Purcell effect. To demonstrate this, we designed, fabricated, and characterized an integrated piezo-optomechanical Fabry-Perot cavity on the erbium-doped thin-film lithium niobate platform. By collecting fluorescence from the optomechanical sideband, we show that 93 dB suppression of the pump can be achieved with 10 dB loss of signal, resulting in an increase of 83 dB in sideband-pump ratio. Our results facilitate a route to realize filterless single phonon counting and also create new opportunities to study the interaction between solid state emitters and mechanical systems.

TI Fabrication and Photoluminescence Studies of Tin-Vacancy Centers in
   Chemical Vapor Deposition Diamond
SO ACS MATERIALS LETTERS
AB Group IV color centers in diamond are promising single-photon emitters for quantum information processing and networking. Among them, the tin-vacancy (SnV) center stands out due to its long spin coherence times at cryogenic temperatures above 1 K. While SnV centers have been realized using various fabrication routes, their in situ formation via microwave plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition (MW PE CVD) remains relatively unexplored. In this study, SnV centers, identified by a zero-phonon line (ZPL) near 620 nm, were synthesized in nanocrystalline diamond and free-standing microcrystalline diamond using tin oxide (SnO2) as a dopant source at substrate temperatures of 750 degrees C and 850 degrees C. Photoluminescence measurements reveal that lowering the substrate temperature enhances both the ZPL intensity and spatial uniformity of SnV centers. These results highlight substrate temperature as a key parameter for controlling SnV incorporation during MW PE CVD growth and provide insights into optimizing fabrication strategies for diamond-based quantum technologies.

TI Characterizing long-range entanglement in a mixed state through an
   emergent order on the entangling surface
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Topologically-ordered phases of matter at nonzero temperature are conjectured to exhibit universal pat-terns of long-range entanglement, which can be detected using the entanglement negativity, a mixed-state entanglement measure. In this paper, we show that the entanglement negativity in certain topological orders can be understood through the properties of an emergent symmetry-protected topological (SPT) order that is localized on the entanglement bipartition. This connection leads to an understanding of (i) universal contributions to the entanglement negativity, which diagnose finite-temperature topological order and (ii) the behavior of the entanglement negativity across certain phase transitions in which thermal fluctuations eventually destroy long-range entanglement across the bipartition surface. Within this correspondence, the universal patterns of entanglement in the finite-temperature topological order are related to the stability of an emergent SPT order against a symmetry-breaking field. SPT orders protected by higher-form symmetries-which arise, for example, in the description of the entanglement negativity for Z2 topological order in d = 4 spatial dimensions-remain robust even in the presence of a weak symmetry-breaking perturbation, leading to long-range entanglement at nonzero temperature for certain topological orders.

TI Crosstalk- and charge-noise-induced multiqubit decoherence in
   exchange-coupled quantum dot spin qubit arrays
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
AB We determine the interqubit crosstalk- and charge-noise-induced decoherence time T-2* for a system of L exchange-coupled electronic spin qubits in arrays of size L=3-14 for a number of different multiqubit geometries by directly calculating the return probability. We compare the behavior of the return probability to other quantities, namely, the average spin, the Hamming distance, and the entanglement entropy. In all cases, we use a starting state with alternating spins, vertical bar Psi(0)> = vertical bar down arrow up arrow down arrow...>. We show that a power law behavior, T-2*proportional to L-gamma, is a good fit to the results for the chain and ring geometries as a function of the number of qubits and provide numerical results for the exponent gamma. We find that T-2* depends crucially on the multiqubit geometry of the system. We also calculate the expectation value of one of the spins, the Hamming distance, and the entanglement entropy and show that they are good proxies for the return probability for measuring T-2*. A key finding is that T-2* decreases with increasing L. We also demonstrate that these results may be understood in terms of perturbation theory and its breakdown.

TI Ab initio experimental violation of Bell inequalities
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB The violation of a Bell inequality is the paradigmatic example of device-independent quantum information: The nonclassicality of the data is certified without the knowledge of the functioning of devices. In practice, however, all Bell experiments rely on the precise understanding of the underlying physical mechanisms. Given that, it is natural to ask: Can one witness nonclassical behavior in a truly black-box scenario? Here, we propose and implement, computationally and experimentally, a solution to this ab initio task. It exploits a robust automated optimization approach based on the stochastic Nelder-Mead algorithm. Treating preparation and measurement devices as black boxes, and relying on the observed statistics only, our adaptive protocol approaches the optimal Bell inequality violation after a limited number of iterations for a variety photonic states, measurement responses, and Bell scenarios. In particular, we exploit it for randomness certification from unknown states and measurements. Our results demonstrate the power of automated algorithms, opening a venue for the experimental implementation of device-independent quantum technologies.

TI Designing Majorana Quasiparticles in InAsP Quantum Dots in InP Nanowires
   with Variational Quantum Eigenvalue Solver
SO PHYSICA STATUS SOLIDI B-BASIC SOLID STATE PHYSICS
AB This work presents steps toward the design of Majorana zero modes (MZM) in InAsP quantum dots embedded in an InP semiconducting nanowire in contact with a p-type superconductor described by the Kitaev Hamiltonian. The single-particle spectrum is obtained from million atom atomistic calculations with QNANO and many-electron spectra using exact diagonalization and the hybrid variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) method. A variational ansatz is constructed to capture the ground state of the system by utilizing a generalized form of the analytical solution for a particular set of parameters. By systematically deviating from the analytically solvable regime while maintaining the system in the topological phase, the effectiveness of the variational function in reproducing the correct ground state and topological properties of the system is evaluated. This is done through a quantum algorithm for a many-body state containing MZM. The results are compared with exact solution in topological phase and demonstrate the capability of VQE, along with classical simulations, to accurately model the many-body spectra in topologically nontrivial state.

TI Quantum in the Media: A Content Analysis of Dutch Newspapers
SO SCIENCE COMMUNICATION
AB Quantum technology is expected to have an impact on society. Earlier literature suggests that certain themes may either create barriers or facilitate effective science communication. We studied 385 Dutch newspaper articles for the use of these themes. Newspapers commonly explained quantum concepts when mentioning quantum technology. They also regularly presented quantum technology as beneficial and enigmatic, often in prominent positions of the articles. The themes on economic development/competitiveness, mystical viewpoint, social progress, and risks were less common. Although these barriers are only potential barriers, we encourage journalists to weigh them when communicating about quantum technology.

TI Quantum Interference of Spontaneous Emission and Coherent Population
   Trapping for a Quantum Emitter Embedded Within a Two-Dimensional
   Photonic Crystal
SO PHOTONICS
AB We investigate the phenomenon of quantum interference in spontaneous emission pathways for a quantum emitter embedded in a two-dimensional photonic crystal composed of a square lattice of dielectric cylindrical rods. Using a V-type three-level system as a model, we demonstrate that the anisotropic Purcell effect inherent in such photonic structures can amplify quantum interference to its theoretical maximum, where the degree of interference p reaches unity. This results in the complete suppression of spontaneous emission for one polarization (directional suppression) and the emergence of coherent population trapping without the need for external coherent fields. By employing density matrix formalism, we derive analytical expressions for the population dynamics and identify conditions for indefinite or long-lived excited-state population. Our findings can find application in quantum technologies, including high-precision atomic clocks, magnetometry, and quantum information processing.

TI Compositional Reversible Computation
SO REVERSIBLE COMPUTATION, RC 2024
SE Lecture Notes in Computer Science
CT 16th International Conference on Reversible Computation (RC)
CY JUL 04-05, 2024
CL Torun, POLAND
AB Reversible computing is motivated by both pragmatic and foundational considerations arising from a variety of disciplines. We take a particular path through the development of reversible computation, emphasizing compositional reversible computation. We start from a historical perspective, by reviewing those approaches that developed reversible extensions of lambda-calculi, Turing machines, and communicating process calculi. These approaches share a common challenge: computations made reversible in this way do not naturally compose locally.
   We then turn our attention to computational models that eschew the detour via existing irreversible models. Building on an original analysis by Landauer, the insights of Bennett, Fredkin, and Toffoli introduced a fresh approach to reversible computing in which reversibility is elevated to the status of the main design principle. These initial models are expressed using low-level bit manipulations, however.
   Abstracting from the low-level of the Bennett-Fredkin-Toffoli models and pursuing more intrinsic, typed, and algebraic models, naturally leads to rig categories as the canonical model for compositional reversible programming. The categorical model reveals connections to type isomorphisms, symmetries, permutations, groups, and univalent universes. This, in turn, paves the way for extensions to reversible programming based on monads and arrows. These extensions are shown to recover conventional irreversible programming, a variety of reversible computational effects, and more interestingly both pure (measurement-free) and measurement-based quantum programming.

TI High-Spin Emission and Giant Magnetoluminescence from a Luminescent
   Organic Triradical
SO CCS CHEMISTRY
AB Organic triradicals represent a distinctive subclass of high-spin open-shell molecules with significant potential in organic magnets, spintronics, and quantum information technologies. However, the integration of luminescent properties with high-spin states- and the realization of spin-dependent optical modulation-remains largely unexplored. Here, we present a luminescent organic triradical, Cz-3TTM, that exhibits efficient quartet-state emission at the singlemolecule level, enabling spin-optical modulation. As a result, Cz-3TTM shows giant magnetoluminescence (ML > 600%) at 2 K under 7 T and strong thermally activated emission, with an intensity enhancement exceeding 3300% across the 2-120 K range. Moreover, it features relatively long spin relaxation (T-1 = 4.726 mu s) and coherence (T-m = 401.4 ns) times even at room temperature. These findings initiate the exploration of spin-optical modulation in luminescent triradicals and establish a molecular platform that bridges high-spin states with optoelectronic functionality for emerging quantum technologies.

TI Two-electron two-nucleus effective Hamiltonian and the spin diffusion
   barrier
SO SCIENCE ADVANCES
AB Dynamic nuclear polarization (DNP) and emerging quantum technologies rely on the spin transfer in electron-nuclear hybrid quantum systems. Spin transfers might be suppressed by larger couplings, e.g., hyperfine couplings suppressing nuclear dipolar flip-flops ("spin diffusion barrier"). We apply the Schrieffer-Wolff transformation to a two-electron two-nucleus spin system involving dipolar and hyperfine couplings in their tensorial form and study possible polarization-transfer processes. Among the different effective Hamiltonian matrix elements investigated is an energy-conserving electron-nuclear four-spin flip-flop, which combines an electronic with a nuclear dipolar flip-flop. The relevance of this electron-nuclear four-spin flip-flop for nuclear spin diffusion close to electrons is supported by model fits of HypRes-on experimental data. We connect the closely related fields of magnetic resonance and quantum information and provide a model that explains how all nuclear spins can contribute to the hyperpolarization of the bulk without a spin diffusion barrier in DNP.

TI Room-temperature addressing of single rare-earth atoms in optical fiber
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW APPLIED
AB Rare-earth (RE) atoms in solid-state materials are attractive components for photonic quantum information systems because of their coherence properties even in high-temperature environments. We have experimentally performed the single-site optical spectroscopy and optical addressing of a single RE atom in an amorphous silica optical fiber at room temperature. The single-site optical spectroscopy of the tapered RE-doped fiber shows nonresonant emission lines similar to those seen in the case of an unstructured fiber and the autocorrelation function of photons emitted from the fiber shows the antibunching effect due to the spatial isolation given by the tapered fiber structure. The ability to address single RE atoms at room temperature provides a very stable and cost-effective technical platform for the realization of a solid-state system for a large-scale quantum optical network and other quantum technologies based on a large number of spectral channels from visible to midinfrared wavelengths.

TI Hardware Acceleration of Crystals-Kyber in Low-Complexity Embedded
   Systems With RISC-V Instruction Set Extensions
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB The imminent rise of practical quantum computing threatens well-established cryptography algorithms for secret key exchange in use today, such as Diffie-Hellman, RSA and Elliptic Curve based schemes. To answer this challenge, the National Institute for Standard and Technology (NIST) has launched a competition for Key Encapsulation Mechanism (KEM) algorithms showing resistance to classical and quantum-based attacks. In July 2022, NIST announced that the Crystals-Kyber algorithm was chosen as the competition's winner, being standardized as ML-KEM. This work aims to explore hardware acceleration through Instruction Set Extensions (ISEs) in a low-end 32-bit RISC-V core (Ibex) in a comprehensive evaluation of performance, energy consumption, memory footprint and die area costs. Four different parametrizations of Kyber symmetric primitives are evaluated: the well-known SHA-3 and AES/SHA-2 based versions (Kyber-FIPS202 and Kyber-90s); and 2 novel parametrizations using Ascon and TurboSHAKE (Kyber-Ascon and Kyber-Turbo). Hardware acceleration of symmetric primitives in Kyber-90s with the Zkne and Zknh ISEs shows performance and energy gains of 42% and 37% for Kyber-512 encapsulation. Combining the acceleration of primitives with a novel Xkyber ISE accelerating polynomial arithmetic, CBD sampling and coefficient compression, further gains of 47% and 41% in performance and energy consumption are observed (for Kyber-512 encapsulation), while also reducing Kyber code size by 15%. Xkyber area costs are of 13% of the baseline Ibex processor with no ISEs or 4.3K equivalent gates. Software and RTL implementations are publicly available at github.com/cggewehr/RISCV-crypto.

TI Comprehensive Analysis and Implementation of Isogeny-Based Hash
   Functions
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB This paper analyzes the security and performance of the isogeny-based hash functions. The isogeny-based hash function was first proposed by Charles, Goren, and Lauter, and is referred to as the CGL hash function. However, Lauter and Petit demonstrated that a collision could be found if the endomorphism ring of the starting curve is known. Subsequently, isogeny hash functions that mitigate the Lauter-Petit attack have been proposed. This paper analyzes three methods that counter the Lauter-Petit attack: the methods proposed by Panny, Zaman and Min, and Larsson. In particular, we propose a new isogeny-based hash function SHH, which exploits Panny's method with Hessian curves. We then analyze the security and performance of the proposed SHH along with the methods by Zaman and Min (SCH) and Larsson (SLH). More specifically, the security was analyzed in the context of the Lauter-Petit attack, collision resistance, and fault tolerance. The analysis in this paper shows that all three algorithms can counter the Lauter-Petit attack. However, for SCH, we demonstrated that collision pairs could be found with carelessly chosen parameters. This paper also provides guidelines for selecting parameters to make SCH collision-resistant. From a fault-tolerance perspective, SCH and SLH are not fault-tolerant. We also present the results of implementing the three algorithms in SageMath. The implementation results show that at the 128-bit security level, hashing a 256-bit message takes 0.130s for SCH, 0.125s for projective-SLH, and 0.162s for SHH. As can be seen from the implementation results, projective-SLH is the most efficient, while SHH performs slower due to the use of a larger finite field.

TI Long-term stability of squeezed light in a fiber-based system using
   automated alignment
SO REVIEW OF SCIENTIFIC INSTRUMENTS
AB Providing a cloud service for optical quantum computing requires stabilizing the optical system for extended periods. It is advantageous to construct a fiber-based system, which does not require spatial alignment. However, fiber-based systems are instead subject to fiber-specific instabilities. For instance, there are phase drifts due to ambient temperature changes and external disturbances and polarization fluctuations due to the finite polarization extinction ratio of fiber components. Here, we report the success of measuring squeezed light with a fiber system for 24 h. To do this, we introduce stabilization mechanics to suppress fluctuations in the fiber system and an integrated controller to automatically align the entire system. The squeezed light at a wavelength of 1545.3 nm is measured every 2 min, where automated alignments are inserted every 30 min. The squeezing levels with an average of -4.42 dB are recorded with an extremely small standard deviation of 0.08 dB over 24 h. With the technologies developed here, we can build complicated optical setups with the fiber-based system and operate them automatically for extended periods, which is promising for cloud service of quantum computation.

TI Fast and Robust Optical Cooling via Shortcut to Adiabaticity
SO ENTROPY
AB Optical cooling is a key technique for preparing ultracold atoms in quantum technologies and precision experiments. We employ shortcut-to-adiabaticity (STA) techniques to accelerate and stabilize laser-based atomic cooling protocols. This approach improves the performance of conventional adiabatic momentum transfer schemes by addressing key limitations such as Doppler shifts, laser intensity fluctuations, and spontaneous emission. We first examine two- and three-level atomic systems subjected to counter-propagating laser pulses that induce momentum reduction through photon recoil. STA methods are then employed to construct pulse sequences that are robust against detuning errors and amplitude noise, outperforming standard pi-pulse schemes in resilience. Meanwhile, we analyze the dissipative dynamics during the momentum transfer and demonstrate the superiority of the STA protocol in enhancing momentum transfer efficiency via accelerated control. The results demonstrate that STA can significantly improve both the efficiency and robustness of cooling. These findings have implications for applications in atomic physics, quantum information processing, and precision metrology.

TI Cation Vacancy in Wide Bandgap III-Nitrides as Single-Photon Emitter: A
   First-Principles Investigation
SO ADVANCED SCIENCE
AB Single-photon sources based on solid-state material are desirable in quantum technologies. However, suitable platforms for single-photon emission are currently limited. Herein, a theoretical approach to design a single-photon emitter based on defects in solid-state material is proposed. Through group theory analysis and hybrid density functional theory calculation, the charge-neutral cation vacancy in III-V compounds is found to satisfy a unique 5-electron-8-orbital electronic configuration with T-d symmetry, which is possible for single-photon emission. Furthermore, it is confirmed that this type of single-photon emitter only exists in wide bandgap III-nitrides among all the III-V compounds. The corresponding photon energy in GaN, AlN, and AlGaN lies within the optimal range for transfer in optical fiber, thereby render the charge-neutral cation vacancy in wide-bandgap III-nitrides as a promising single-photon emitter for quantum information applications.

TI No foundations for metaphysical coherentism
SO PHILOSOPHICAL STUDIES
AB Recently, metaphysical coherentism has been propounded as an alternative to metaphysical foundationalism and infinitism. The view replaces the picture of reality as a hierarchy of levels with that of a network of objects or facts standing in symmetric or, more generally, cyclic relations of metaphysical dependence. This paper defends the orthodox picture of a well-founded hierarchy against the claimed superiority of coherentism. First, it will be argued that alleged theoretical advantages of coherentism do not hold up to scrutiny. Secondly, examples that are claimed to support coherentism are either misdescribed as involving metaphysical interdependence, or foundationalist treatments fare at least as good and often better than coherentist interpretations. Thirdly, a similar diagnosis applies to a recently proposed coherentist interpretation of quantum entanglement. The more general diagnosis is that claims of metaphysical dependence are convincing only if there is a detailed account of how one item metaphysically explains another. While foundationalists can resort to various specific explanatory relations, coherentism seems to be incapable of providing detailed explanations.

TI Interaction of a Four-Level Atom with a Deformed Quantum Field:
   Mathematical Model and Quantum Resources
SO AXIOMS
AB We introduce a framework presenting the interaction between a four-level atom (F-LA) and a field mode that begins in a coherent state within the para-Bose field (P-BF). The F-LA is considered in a cascade configuration and initially prepared in the upper level. We display the system dynamics by solving the motion equation. We discuss various dynamical behaviors of fundamental quantum resources used in quantum optics and information tasks, including atomic population inversion, quantum entanglement (QE), and the statistical properties of the P-BF based on the parameters of the quantum model. In this context, we demonstrate the impact of various system parameters on these quantum resources. Finally, we illustrate the dynamic relationships among the quantum resources within the model.

TI Sufficient criteria for absolute separability in arbitrary dimensions
   via linear map inverses
SO REPORTS ON PROGRESS IN PHYSICS
AB Quantum states that remain separable (i.e. not entangled) under any global unitary transformation are known as absolutely separable and form a convex set. Despite extensive efforts, the complete characterization of this set remains largely unknown. In this work, we employ linear maps and their inverses to derive new sufficient analytical conditions for absolute separability in arbitrary dimensions, providing extremal points of this set and improving its characterization. Additionally, we employ convex geometry optimization to refine the characterization of the set when multiple non-comparable criteria for absolute separability are available. We also address the closely related problem of characterizing the absolute PPT (positive partial transposition) set, which consists of quantum states that remain positive under partial transposition across all unitary transformations. Finally, we extend our results to multipartite states. We are proud to dedicate our work to Professor Ryszard Horodecki, whose pioneering contributions to the field of quantum entanglement continue to inspire us all. With deep gratitude and respect.

TI Entanglement Rényi negativity of interacting fermions from quantum Monte
   Carlo simulations
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Many-body entanglement unveils additional aspects of quantum matter and offers insights into strongly correlated physics. While ground-state entanglement has received much attention in the past decade, the study of mixed-state quantum entanglement using negativity in interacting fermionic systems remains largely unexplored. We demonstrate that the partially transposed density matrix of interacting fermions, similar to their reduced density matrix, can be expressed as a weighted sum of Gaussian states describing free fermions, enabling the calculation of rank-n R & eacute;nyi negativity within the determinant quantum Monte Carlo framework. We calculate the rank-two R & eacute;nyi negativity for the half-filled Hubbard model and the spinless t-V model. Our calculation reveals that the area law coefficient of the R & eacute;nyi negativity for the spinless t-V model has a logarithmic finite-size scaling at the finite-temperature transition point. Our work contributes to the calculation of entanglement and sets the stage for future studies on quantum entanglement in various fermionic many-body mixed states.

TI Randomized tensor network reservoir computing: validity and learnability
   phase transitions
SO MACHINE LEARNING-SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB Reservoir computing (RC) systems, traditionally based on echo state networks (ESN) or liquid state machines, have shown significant potential in dynamic temporal data modeling, such as weather forecasting and astronomical predictions. However, these frameworks are known not being applicable to quantum dynamics-based RC. Tensor networks (TNs), with their efficient representation of high-dimensional quantum information and entanglement, are powerful tools for modeling correlated quantum dynamics. Introducing randomized effects into TNs, akin to randomization of recurrent connections in traditional RC, is expected to generate diverse quantum correlation patterns and provide robust, generalizable quantum-inspired dynamic models through randomization. In this work, we propose a novel randomized TN-based RC scheme, experimentally demonstrating its validity. A theoretical model selection criterion is constructed to find the optimal TNRC hyperparameters. Critical phenomena along with the phase transitions of learnability near the edge of chaos in TN RC are clearly identified. The distribution-independent universality in phase transitions observed in TN RC is captured by the newly developed learning theory and a self-consistent mean-field theory of the spin-glass type. The performance advantage of TNRC over ESN is demonstrated in several forecasting experiments. Our findings lay the groundwork for future explorations into randomized TN quantum machine learning, phase transitions in quantum RC, and the manipulation of critical phenomena in complex systems.

TI Secure post-quantum group key exchange: Implementing a solution based on
   Kyber
SO IET COMMUNICATIONS
AB Quantum computing poses fascinating challenges for current cryptography, threatening the security of many schemes and protocols widely used today. To adapt to this reality, the U.S. National Institute for Standards and Technology (NIST) is currently running a standardization process in search of post-quantum (classical, yet resistant to quantum attacks) cryptographic tools, focusing on signature schemes and key encapsulation mechanisms. Many of the competing proposals also include designs for two-party key exchange, which can be combined in different ways to fit scenarios involving n >= 2$n \ge 2$ parties, that is, yielding group key exchange protocols. However, very few implementations of such group protocols are available to practitioners, which face a non-trivial challenge when deciding how to implement a protocol for establishing secure group sessions in this new post-quantum scenario. With this in mind, the authors report on the implementation of a secure post-quantum group key exchange protocol in the so-called Quantum Random Oracle Model. The protocol decided to implement is based on a KEM called Kyber, which is one of the finalists of the NIST competition. Not only this group construction is the only one available in the literature using a NIST finalist, but also, among all post-quantum designs the authors are aware of, it uses this strongest security model (as, e.g. in other proposals, the adversarial interaction with the hash functions of the system is assumed to be exclusively classical). Furthermore, experimental evidence is provided supporting this choice in terms of performance, even if the number of involved entities is large (up to 2000). All data and code are publicly available.

TI Space-time generalization of mutual information
SO JOURNAL OF HIGH ENERGY PHYSICS
AB The mutual information characterizes correlations between spatially separated regions of a system. Yet, in experiments we often measure dynamical correlations, which involve probing operators that are also separated in time. Here, we introduce a space-time generalization of mutual information which, by construction, satisfies several natural properties of the mutual information and at the same time characterizes correlations across subsystems that are separated in time. In particular, this quantity, that we call the space-time mutual information, bounds all dynamical correlations. We construct this quantity based on the idea of the quantum hypothesis testing. As a by-product, our definition provides a transparent interpretation in terms of an experimentally accessible setup. We draw connections with other notions in quantum information theory, such as quantum channel discrimination. Finally, we study the behavior of the space-time mutual information in several settings and contrast its long-time behavior in many-body localizing and thermalizing systems.

TI CAPSULE NETWORK SEVERAL YEARS LATER: A BIBLIOMETRIC ANALYSIS
SO EURASIAN JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICAL AND COMPUTER APPLICATIONS
AB Bibliometric analysis aims to identify research trends, spot research centers, and find research gaps. We conducted a bibliometric analysis of the Capsule Network method from 2018 to 2023. The research flow began with data collection from Go ogle Trends, Open Knowledge Maps and Scopus. Go ogle Trends was used to get a rough idea of interest over time and the most popular countries. Open Knowledge Maps analysis helped identify intersections between papers related to Capsule Network. The primary data was obtained from Scopus, which was analyzed using ScienceDirect to determine the subject area and Publish or Perish to obtain metadata. The metadata was then analyzed using VOSviewer to identify keyword associations and understand annual trends, the number of articles, and most citations. We also searched for research gaps connected to the Connected Paper website to identify topics that could be developed in the future. The analysis showed a decline in interest in the Capsule Network method. We obtained 170 papers identified in Scopus with the highest publication in 2019 with 50 papers, then decreased by 86% in the following years. Most publications are in IEEE Access with the dominant subject area being Computer Science. The research gap that we can propose is related to quantum computation. We suggest further research on quantum computing which has excellent potential for the future development of the Capsule Network method.

AB Transmon qubits have become a leading technology in quantum information science (QIS), with fabrication techniques widely accessible. Historically, devices were predominantly made from aluminum (Al) and niobium (Nb), but state-of-the-art transmons now use tantalum (Ta) achieving coherence times up to and exceeding 0.5 milliseconds [1-3]. The differentiation in performance between Ta and Nb-based devices is attributed to the surface oxidation states affecting Two -Level-System (TLS) noise. One approach to quickly evaluating material and device performance consists of fabricating only the readout resonator of a qubit and evaluating the quality factor which is the strategy employed in this project. Our research focuses on Ta coplanar waveguide (CPW) resonators fabricated using a damascene technique producing pristine metal structures within silicon substrates. This approach increases the dielectric substrate's participation ratio while keeping device edges oxide-free due to entrenchment. This collaborative effort, involving Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL), NY CREATES/SUNY Poly, and Brookhaven National Laboratory (BNL), has resulted in resonators with Q factors as high as 10' at low power. Ongoing studies aim to further understand and improve device performance by systematic analysis of oxygen trapped between device layers during processing. This research showcases the potential for significant improvements in superconducting qubit performance via the damascene process, heralding new possibilities for the advancement of scalable QIS technology.

TI Role of boundary conditions in quantum computations of scattering
   observables
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW D
AB Quantum computing may offer the opportunity to simulate strongly interacting field theories, such as quantum chromodynamics, with physical time evolution. This would give access to Minkowski-signature correlators, in contrast to the Euclidean calculations routinely performed at present. However, as with present-day calculations, quantum computation strategies still require the restriction to a finite system size, including a finite, usually periodic, spatial volume. In this work, we investigate the consequences of this in the extraction of hadronic and Compton-like scattering amplitudes. Using the framework presented in Briceno et al. [Phys. Rev. D 101, 014509 (2020)], we estimate the volume effects for various 1 + 1D Minkowski-signature quantities and show that these can be a significant source of systematic uncertainty, even for volumes that are very large by the standards of present-day Euclidean calculations. We then present an improvement strategy, based in the fact that the finite volume has a reduced symmetry. This implies that kinematic points, which yield the same Lorentz invariants, may still be physically distinct in the periodic system. As we demonstrate, both numerically and analytically, averaging over such sets can significantly suppress the unwanted volume distortions and improve the extraction of the physical scattering amplitudes. As the improvement strategy is based only in kinematics, it can be applied without detailed knowledge of the system.

TI Emergence of Classical Random Walk from Non-Hermitian Effects in Quantum
   Kicked Rotor
SO ENTROPY
AB We investigate the quantum random walk in momentum space of a spinor kicked rotor with a non-Hermitian kicking potential. We find that the variance in momentum distributions transitions from quadratic to linear growth over time for the non-Hermitian case. Correspondingly, the momentum distributions are in the shape of Gaussian wavepackets, providing clear evidence of a classical random walk induced by the non-Hermitian-driven potential. Remarkably, the rate of the linear growth of the variance diverges as the non-Hermitian parameter approaches zero. In the Hermitian case, deviations from the quantum resonance condition dramatically suppress the quadratic growth of the variance, leading to dynamical localization of the quantum walk. Under such quantum non-resonance conditions, the classical random walk is significantly reduced by the non-Hermitian-driven potential. Interestingly, non-Hermiticity enhances quantum entanglement between internal degrees of freedom, while deviations from the quantum resonance condition reduce it. Possible applications of our findings are discussed.

TI Quantum vortices in curved geometries
SO AVS QUANTUM SCIENCE
AB The control over the geometry and topology of quantum systems is crucial for advancing novel quantum technologies. This work provides a synthesis of recent insights into the behavior of quantum vortices within atomic Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs) subject to curved geometric constraints. We highlight the significant impact of the curvature on the condensate density and phase distribution, particularly in quasi-one-dimensional waveguides for different angular momentum states. An engineered periodic transport of the quantized vorticity between density-coupled ring-shaped condensates is discussed. The significant role of curved geometry in shaping the dynamics of rotational Josephson vortices in long atomic Josephson junctions is illustrated for the system of vertically stacked toroidal condensates. Different methods for the controlled creation of rotational Josephson vortices in coupled ring systems are described in the context of the formation of long-lived vortex configurations in shell-shaped BECs with cylindrical geometry. Future directions of explorations of vortices in curved geometries with implications for quantum information processing and sensing technologies are discussed.

TI Local Entanglement of Electrons in 1D Hydrogen Molecule
SO ENTROPY
AB The quantum entanglement entropy of the electrons in a one-dimensional hydrogen molecule is quantified locally using an appropriate partitioning of the two-dimensional configuration space. Both the global and the local entanglement entropy exhibit a monotonic increase when increasing the inter-nuclear distance, while the local entropy remains peaked in the middle between the nuclei with its width decreasing. Our findings show that at the inter-nuclear distance where a stable hydrogen molecule is formed, the quantum entropy shows no peculiarity thus indicating that the entropy and the energy measures display different sensitivity with respect to the interaction between the two identical electrons involved. One possible explanation is that the calculation of the quantum entropy does not account explicitly for the distance between the nuclei, which contrasts to the total energy calculation where the energy minimum depends decisively on that distance. The numerically exact and the time-dependent quantum Monte Carlo calculations show close results.

TI What can unitary sequences tell us about multi-time physics?
SO QUANTUM
AB Multi-time quantum processes are endowed with the same richness as multipartite states, including temporal entanglement and exotic causal structures. However, experimentally probing these rich phenomena leans heavily on fast and clean mid-circuit measurements, which are rarely available. We show here how surprisingly accessible these phenomena are in nascent quantum processors even when faced with substantially limited control. We work within the limitation where only unitary control is allowed, followed by a terminating measurement. Within this setting, we first develop a witness for genuine multi-time entanglement, and then methods to bound (from top and bottom) multi-time entanglement, non-Markovianity, purity, entropy, and other correlative measures. Our tools are designed to be implemented on quantum information processors, which we proceed to demonstrate. Finally, we discuss the limitations of these methods by testing them across random multi-time processes. Conceptually, this broadens our understanding of the extent to which temporal correlations may be determined with only deterministic control. Our techniques are pertinent to generic quantum stochastic dynamical processes, with a scope ranging across condensed matter physics, quantum biology, and in-depth diagnostics of NISQ-era quantum devices.

TI Module-Lattice-Based Key-Encapsulation Mechanism Performance
   Measurements
SO SCI
AB Key exchange mechanisms are foundational to secure communication, yet traditional methods face challenges from quantum computing. The Module-Lattice-Based Key-Encapsulation Mechanism (ML-KEM) is a post-quantum cryptographic key exchange protocol with unknown successful quantum vulnerabilities. This study evaluates the ML-KEM using experimental benchmarks. We implement the ML-KEM in Python for clarity and in C++ for performance, demonstrating the latter's substantial performance improvements. The C++ implementation achieves microsecond-level execution times for key generation, encapsulation, and decapsulation. Python, while slower, provides a user-friendly introduction to the ML-KEM's operation. Moreover, our Python benchmark confirmed that the ML-KEM consistently outperformed RSA in execution speed across all tested parameters. Beyond benchmarking, the ML-KEM is shown to handle the computational hardness of the Module Learning With Errors (MLWE) problem, ensuring resilience against quantum attacks, classical attacks, and Artificial Intelligence (AI)-based attacks, since the ML-KEM has no pattern that could be detected. To evaluate its practical feasibility on constrained devices, we also tested the C++ implementation on a Raspberry Pi 4B, representing IoT use cases. Additionally, we attempted to run integration and benchmark tests for the ML-KEM on microcontrollers such as the ESP32 DevKit, ESP32 Super Mini, ESP8266, and Raspberry Pi Pico, but these trials were unsuccessful due to memory constraints. The results showed that while the ML-KEM can operate effectively in such environments, only devices with sufficient resources and runtimes can support its computational demands. While resource-intensive, the ML-KEM offers scalable security across diverse domains such as IoT, cloud environments, and financial systems, making it a key solution for future cryptographic standards.

TI Entangled photons enabled time-frequency-resolved coherent Raman
   spectroscopy and applications to electronic coherences at femtosecond
   scale
SO LIGHT-SCIENCE & APPLICATIONS
AB Quantum entanglement has emerged as a great resource for spectroscopy and its importance in two-photon spectrum and microscopy has been demonstrated. Current studies focus on the two-photon absorption, whereas the Raman spectroscopy with quantum entanglement still remains elusive, with outstanding issues of temporal and spectral resolutions. Here we study the new capabilities provided by entangled photons in coherent Raman spectroscopy. An ultrafast frequency-resolved Raman spectroscopy with entangled photons is developed for condensed-phase molecules, to probe the electronic and vibrational coherences. Using quantum correlation between the photons, the signal shows the capability of both temporal and spectral resolutions not accessible by either classical pulses or the fields without entanglement. We develop a microscopic theory for this Raman spectroscopy, revealing the electronic coherence dynamics even at timescale of 50fs. This suggests new paradigms of optical signals and spectroscopy, with potential to push detection below standard quantum limit.

TI Spatiotemporal heterogeneity of entanglement in many-body localized
   systems
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
AB We propose a spatiotemporal characterization of the entanglement dynamics in many-body localized (MBL) systems, which exhibits a striking resemblance to dynamical heterogeneity in classical glasses. Specifically, we find that the relaxation times of local entanglement, as measured by the concurrence, are spatially correlated yielding a dynamical length scale for quantum entanglement. As a consequence of this spatiotemporal analysis, we observe that the considered MBL system is made up of dynamically correlated clusters with a size set by this entanglement length scale. The system decomposes into compartments of different activity such as active regions with fast quantum entanglement dynamics and inactive regions where the dynamics is slow. We further find that the relaxation times of the on-site concurrence become broadly distributed and more spatially correlated, as disorder increases or the energy of the initial state decreases. Through this spatiotemporal characterization of entanglement, our work unravels a previously unrecognized connection between the behavior of classical glasses and the genuine quantum dynamics of MBL systems.

TI Strong interactions between integrated microresonators and alkali atomic
   vapors: towards single-atom, single-photon operation
SO OPTICA
AB Cavity quantum electrodynamics (cQED), the interaction of a two-level system with a high quality factor ( Q) cavity, is a foundational building block in different architectures for quantum computation, communication, and metrology. The strong interaction between the atom and the cavity enables single-photon operation, which is required for quantum gates and sources. Cold atoms, quantum dots, and color centers in crystals are among the systems that have shown single-photon operations, but they require significant physical infrastructure. Atomic vapors, on the other hand, require limited experimental infrastructure and are hence much easier to deploy outside a laboratory, but they consist of an ensemble of moving atoms that results in short interaction times involving multiple atoms, which can hamper quantum operations. A solution to this issue can be found in nanophotonic cavities, where the optical mode is confined to a small volume and light-matter interaction is enhanced, so that fast single-atom, single-photon operations are enabled. In this work, we study the interaction of an atomically clad microring resonator (ACMRR) with different-sized ensembles of Rb atoms. We demonstrate strong coupling between an ensemble of approximate to 50 atoms interacting with a high quality factor ( Q = 4.3 x 105) ACMRR, yielding a many-atom cooperativity C = (5.5 +/- 0.3). We continue to observe signatures of atom-photon interaction for a few (<3) atoms, for which we observe saturation at the level of a few intracavity photons. Further development of our platform, which includes integrated thermo-optic heaters to enable cavity tuning and stabilization, should enable the observation of interactions between single photons and single atoms.

TI Once-in-a-lifetime encounter models for neutrino media: From coherent
   oscillations to flavor equilibration
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW D
AB Collective neutrino oscillations are typically studied using the lowest -order quantum kinetic equation, also known as the mean -field approximation. However, some recent quantum many -body simulations suggest that quantum entanglement among neutrinos may be important and may result in flavor equilibration of the neutrino gas. In this work, we develop new quantum models for neutrino gases in which any pair of neutrinos can interact at most once in their lifetimes. A key parameter of our models is gamma = mu Delta z , where mu is the neutrino coupling strength, which is proportional to the neutrino density, and Delta z is the duration over which a pair of neutrinos can interact each time. Our models reduce to the mean -field approach in the limit gamma -> 0 and achieve flavor equilibration in time t >> ( gamma mu ) - 1 . These models demonstrate the emergence of coherent flavor oscillations from the particle perspective and may help elucidate the role of quantum entanglement in collective neutrino oscillations.

TI Bosonic Representation of Matrices and Angular Momentum Probabilistic
   Representation of Cyclic States
SO ENTROPY
AB The Jordan-Schwinger map allows us to go from a matrix representation of any arbitrary Lie algebra to an oscillator (bosonic) representation. We show that any Lie algebra can be considered for this map by expressing the algebra generators in terms of the oscillator creation and annihilation operators acting in the Hilbert space of quantum oscillator states. Then, to describe quantum states in the probability representation of quantum oscillator states, we express their density operators in terms of conditional probability distributions (symplectic tomograms) or Husimi-like probability distributions. We illustrate this general scheme by examples of qubit states (spin-1/2 su(2)-group states) and even and odd Schrodinger cat states related to the other representation of su(2)-algebra (spin-j representation). The two-mode coherent-state superpositions associated with cyclic groups are studied, using the Jordan-Schwinger map. This map allows us to visualize and compare different properties of the mentioned states. For this, the su(2) coherent states for different angular momenta j are used to define a Husimi-like Q representation. Some properties of these states are explicitly presented for the cyclic groups C2 and C3. Also, their use in quantum information and computing is mentioned.

TI Quantum Minimum Searching Algorithms for Active User Detection in
   Wireless IoT Networks
SO IEEE INTERNET OF THINGS JOURNAL
AB The key features of 5G, such as ultrareliable low latency (URLLC) and massive machine-type communication (mMTC), are designed to address the need for low latency and the ability to connect a large number of devices in the Internet of Things context. To support these constraints, mobile devices transmit information without previously establishing a connection with the base station (BS). This requires the BS to detect in real-time the active users [process known as active user detection (AUD)]. With classical processors, one can employ the maximum likelihood (ML) method (the optimal detector, but suffers from high complexity and delay), or suboptimal ones (which are simpler, but less reliable). Meanwhile, quantum algorithms, particularly Durr and H & oslash;yer (DHA) algorithm, addressing minimum searching problems, can significantly reduce complexity while keeping good performances. However, these algorithms were designed for generic problems, and their initialization and parameterization are blindly done. Nonetheless, we can have access to prior information on the system's behavior. Therefore, in this article, we aim to adapt and improve these quantum algorithms by using prior knowledge on the system for the AUD problem. We first propose a novel algorithm, the improved iterative minimum searching algorithm (IIMSA) where we define more efficiently the parameters. Then, further enhancements of IIMSA are obtained thanks to a better initialization of the algorithms by exploiting classical preprocessing of the received signals with classical conventional correlation receiver (CCR) or zero forcing (ZF). The obtained results show that these proposed algorithms operate more efficiently (i.e., less complexity with better accuracy).

TI Unitary-transformed projective squeezing: Applications for circuit
   knitting and state preparation of non-Gaussian states
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Continuous-variable (CV) quantum computing is a promising candidate for quantum computation because it can, even with one mode, utilize infinite-dimensional Hilbert spaces and can efficiently handle continuous values. Although photonic platforms have been considered as a leading platform for CV computation, hybrid systems that use both qubits and bosonic modes, e.g., superconducting hardware, have shown significant advances because they can prepare non-Gaussian states by utilizing the nonlinear interaction between the qubits and the bosonic modes. However, the size of hybrid hardware is currently restricted. Moreover, the fidelity of the nonGaussian state is also restricted. This work extends the projective squeezing method to establish a formalism for projecting quantum states onto the states that are unitary-transformed from the squeezed vacuum at the expense of the sampling cost. Based on this formalism, we propose methods for simulating larger quantum devices and projecting states onto the cubic phase state, a typical non-Gaussian state, with a higher squeezing level and higher nonlinearity. To make implementation practical, we can, by leveraging the interactions in hybrid systems of qubits and bosonic modes, apply the smeared projector by using either the linear-combination-of-unitaries or virtual quantum error detection algorithms. We numerically verify the performance of our methods and show that projection can suppress the effect of photon-loss errors.

TI Accessible and inaccessible quantum coherence in relativistic quantum
   systems
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB The quantum coherence of a multipartite system is investigated when some of the parties are moving with uniform acceleration and the analysis is carried out using the single-mode approximation. Due to acceleration the quantum coherence is divided into two parts as accessible and inaccessible coherence. First we investigate tripartite systems, considering both GHZ and W states. We find that the quantum coherence of these states does not vanish in the limit of infinite acceleration, rather asymptoting to a nonzero value. These results hold for both single- and two-qubit acceleration. In the GHZ and W states the coherence is distributed as correlations between the qubits and is known as global coherence. However, quantum coherence can also exist due to the superposition within a qubit, the local coherence. To study the properties of local coherence we investigate a separable state. The GHZ state, W state, and separable states contain only one type of coherence. Next we consider the W W?? and star states in which both local and global coherences coexist. We find that under uniform acceleration both local and global coherence show similar qualitative behavior. Finally, we derive analytic expressions for the quantum coherence of N-partite GHZ and W states for n < N accelerating qubits. We find that the quantum coherence of a multipartite GHZ state falls exponentially with the number of accelerated qubits, whereas for multipartite W states the quantum coherence decreases only polynomially. We conclude that W states are more robust to Unruh decoherence and discuss some potential applications in satellite-based quantum communication and black-hole physics.

TI A compact public key encryption with equality test for lattice in cloud
   computing
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB The rapid proliferation of cloud computing enables users to access computing resources and storage space over the internet, but it also presents challenges in terms of security and privacy. Ensuring the security and availability of data has become a focal point of current research when utilizing cloud computing for resource sharing, data storage, and querying. Public key encryption with equality test (PKEET) can perform an equality test on ciphertexts without decrypting them, even when those ciphertexts are encrypted under different public keys. That offers a practical approach to dividing up or searching for encrypted information directly. In order to deal with the threat raised by the rapid development of quantum computing, researchers have proposed post-quantum cryptography to guarantee the security of cloud services. However, it is challenging to implement these techniques efficiently. In this paper, a compact PKEET scheme is pro-posed. The new scheme does not encrypt the plaintext's hash value immediately but embeds it into the test trapdoor. We also demon-strated that our new construction is one-way secure under the quantum security model. With those efforts, our scheme can withstand the chosen ciphertext attacks as long as the learning with errors (LWE) assumption holds. Furthermore, we evaluated the new scheme's performance and found that it only costs approximately half the storage space compared with previous schemes. There is an almost half reduction in the computing cost throughout the encryption and decryption stages. In a nutshell, the new PKEET scheme is less costly, more compact, and applicable to cloud computing scenarios in a post-quantum environment.

AB The monogamy of entanglement stands as an indispensable feature within multipartite quantum systems. We study monogamy relations with respect to any partitions for the generalized W-class (GW) states based on the unified-(q, s) entanglement (UE). We provide the monogamy relation based on the squared UE for a reduced density matrix of a qudit GW state, as well as tighter monogamy relations based on the alpha th (alpha >= 2) power of UE. Furthermore, for an n-qudit system ABC 1...C n-2, a generalized monogamy relation and an upper bound satisfied by the beta th (0 <= beta <= 1) power of the UE for the GW states under the partition AB and C 1...C n-2 are established. In particular, two partition-dependent residual entanglements for the GW states are analyzed in detail.

TI Adiabatic state preparation of correlated wave functions with nonlinear
   scheduling functions and broken-symmetry wave functions
SO COMMUNICATIONS CHEMISTRY
AB Adiabatic state preparation (ASP) can generate correlated wave functions for quantum chemical calculations, but is inherently unsuitable for studying strongly correlated systems. Here, the authors perform numerical simulations of ASP for the ground state wave functions of molecules with strongly correlated electrons and propose practical conditions for preparation of close-to-exact correlated wave functions.
   Adiabatic state preparation (ASP) can generate the correlated wave function by simulating the time evolution of wave function under the time-dependent Hamiltonian that interpolates the Fock operator and the full electronic Hamiltonian. However, ASP is inherently unsuitable for studying strongly correlated systems, and furthermore practical computational conditions for ASP are unknown. In quest for the suitable computational conditions for practical applications of ASP, we performed numerical simulations of ASP in the potential energy curves of N-2, BeH2, and in the C-2v quasi-reaction pathway of the Be atom insertion to the H-2 molecule, examining the effect of nonlinear scheduling functions and the ASP with broken-symmetry wave functions with the S-2 operator as the penalty term, contributing to practical applications of quantum computing to quantum chemistry. Eventually, computational guidelines to generate the correlated wave functions having the square overlap with the complete-active space self-consistent field wave function close to unity are discussed.

TI Spatial-spectral mapping to prepare frequency entangled qudits
SO OPTICS LETTERS
AB Entangled qudits, the high-dimensional entangled states, play an important role in the study of quantum information. How to prepare entangled qudits in an efficient and easy-tooperate manner is still a challenge in quantum technology. Here, we demonstrate a method to engineer frequency entangled qudits in a spontaneous parametric downconversion process. The proposal employs an angle-dependent phasematching condition in a nonlinear crystal, which forms a classical-quantum mapping between the spatial (pump) and spectral (biphotons) degrees of freedom. In particular, the pump profile is separated into several bins in the spatial domain, and thus shapes the down-converted biphotons into discrete frequency modes in the joint spectral space. Our approach provides a feasible and efficient method to prepare a high-dimensional frequency entangled state. As an experimental demonstration, we generate a three-dimensional entangled state by using a homemade variable slit mask.

TI Optimal quantum strategy for locating Unruh channels
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB From the perspective of quantum information theory, the effect of Unruh radiation on a two-level accelerated detector can be modeled as a quantum channel. In this work we employ the tools of channel-position finding to locate Unruh channels. The signal-idler and idler-free protocols are explored to determine the position of the target Unruh channel within a sequence of background channels. We derive the fidelity-based bounds for the ultimate error probability of each strategy and obtain the conditions where the signal-idler protocol is superior to the protocol involving idler-free states. It is found that the lower bound of the error probability for the signal-idler scheme exhibits clear advantages in all cases, while the idler-free scheme can only be implemented when the temperatures of the two channels are very close and the number of initial states is insufficient. Interestingly, it is shown that the optimal detection protocol relies on the residual correlations shared between the emitted probe state and the retained idler modes.

TI Bound state in a giant atom-modulated resonators system
SO NPJ QUANTUM INFORMATION
AB It is of fundamental interest in controlling the light-matter interaction for a long time in the field of quantum information processing. Here, we explore a model by coupling a giant atom with the dynamically-modulated coupled-resonator waveguide and find the bound state, where the light shows the localization effect and the atomic decay into resonator modes is inhibited, excited by a propagating photon. An analytical treatment based on the separation of the propagating states and localized states of light has been proposed and provides inspiring explanation of our finding, i.e., there supports a quantum channel where the propagating photon can be converted to the localized state through the quantum interference from light-atom interactions in three resonators at different frequency detunings. Our work therefore shows the potential for actively localizing the photon in a modulated coupled-resonator waveguide system interacting with the giant atom, and also points out a way to study the light-atom interaction in a synthetic frequency dimension that holds the similar Hamiltonian.

TI Flag Gadgets Based on Classical Codes
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB Fault-tolerant syndrome extraction is a key ingredient in implementing fault-tolerant quantum computation. While conventional methods use a number of extra qubits that are linear in the weight of the syndrome, several improvements have been introduced using flag gadgets. In this work, we develop a framework to design flag gadgets using classical codes. Using this framework, we show how to perform fault-tolerant syndrome extraction for any stabilizer code with arbitrary distance using exponentially fewer qubits than conventional methods when qubit measurement and reset are relatively slow compared to a round of error correction. In particular, our method requires only (2t+ 1)t (sic)log(2)(w)(sic) flag qubits to fault-tolerantly measure a weight-w stabilizer. We further take advantage of the saving provided by our construction to fault-tolerantly measure multiple stabilizers using a single gadget and show that it maintains the same exponential advantage when it is used to fault-tolerantly extract the syndromes of quantum low-density parity-check codes. Using the developed framework, we perform computer-assisted search to find several small examples where our constructions reduce the number of qubits required. These small examples may be relevant to near-term experiments on small-scale quantum computers.

TI Engineering holography with stabilizer graph codes
SO NPJ QUANTUM INFORMATION
AB The discovery of holographic codes established a surprising connection between quantum error correction and the anti-de Sitter-conformal field theory correspondence. Recent technological progress in artificial quantum systems renders the experimental realization of such holographic codes now within reach. Formulating the hyperbolic pentagon code in terms of a stabilizer graph code, we give gate sequences that are tailored to systems with long-range interactions. We show how to obtain encoding and decoding circuits for the hyperbolic pentagon code, before focusing on a small instance of the holographic code on twelve qubits. Our approach allows to verify holographic properties by partial decoding operations, recovering bulk degrees of freedom from their nearby boundary.

TI Probing entanglement and testing Bell inequality violation with e plus
    e- → τ plus τ- at Belle II
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW D
AB We present a feasibility study to probe quantum entanglement and Bell inequality violation in the process e+e- -> tau+tau- at a center -of -mass energy of ffis ffi p = 10.579 GeV. The sensitivity of the analysis is enhanced by applying a selection on the scattering angle & thetasym; in the tau+tau- center -of -mass frame. We analyze events in which both tau leptons decay to hadrons, using a combination of decay channels tau- -> pi- nu tau, tau- -> pi- pi 0 nu tau, and tau- -> pi- pi+pi- nu tau. The spin orientation of the tau leptons in these decays is reconstructed using the polarimeter-vec tor method. Assuming a dataset of 200 million tau+tau- events and accounting for experimental resolutions, we expect the observation of quantum entanglement and Bell inequality violation by the Belle -II experiment will be possible with a significance well in excess of five standard deviations.

TI Emission enhancement of erbium in a reverse nanofocusing waveguide
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Since Purcell's seminal report 75 years ago, electromagnetic resonators have been used to control light-matter interactions to make brighter radiation sources and unleash unprecedented control over quantum states of light and matter. Indeed, optical resonators such as microcavities and plasmonic antennas offer excellent control but only over a limited spectral range. Strategies to mutually tune and match emission and resonator frequency are often required, which is intricate and precludes the possibility of enhancing multiple transitions simultaneously. In this letter, we report a strong radiative emission rate enhancement of Er3+-ions across the telecommunications C-band in a single plasmonic waveguide based on the Purcell effect. Our gap waveguide uses a reverse nanofocusing approach to efficiently enhance, extract and guide emission from the nanoscale to a photonic waveguide while keeping plasmonic losses at a minimum. Remarkably, the large and broadband Purcell enhancement allows us to resolve Stark-split electric dipole transitions, which are typically only observed under cryogenic conditions. Simultaneous radiative emission enhancement of multiple quantum states is of great interest for photonic quantum networks and on-chip data communications.
   Emission enhancement and extraction from quantum emitters is a major challenge for photon sources in e.g. quantum photonic networks. Here the authors propose a broadband waveguide platform which allows to boost, extract, and guide quantum emission within integrated photonic networks.

TI Investigation of modified uni-traveling carrier photodiode for cryogenic
   microwave photonic links
SO OPTICS CONTINUUM
AB Quantum devices present the potential for unparalleled computing and communica-tions capabilities; however, the cryogenic temperatures required to successfully control and read out many qubit platforms can prove to be very challenging to scale. Recently, there has emerged an interest in using microwave photonics to deliver control signals down to ultracold stages via optical fiber, thereby reducing thermal load and facilitating dense wavelength multiplexing. Photodetectors can then convert this optical energy to electrical signals for qubit control. The fidelity of the quantum operations of interest therefore depend heavily upon the characteristics of the photodiode, yet experimental demonstrations of fiber-coupled photodetection systems at low temperatures are relatively few in number, leaving important open questions regarding how specific detectors may perform in real-world cryogenic settings. In this work, we examine a highly linear modified uni-traveling carrier photodiode (MUTC-PD) under C-band illumination (1530-1565 nm) at three temperature regimes (300 K, 80 K, and similar to 4 K) and multiple bias condi-tions. Our findings of reduced responsivity but preserved bandwidth are consistent with previous studies, while our saturation tests suggest a variety of potential applications for MUTC-PDs in cryogenic microwave photonics with and without electrical bias. Overall, our results should provide a valuable foundation for the continued and expanding use of this detector technology in quantum information processing.

TI Quantum non-Gaussian states of superfluid Helium vibrations
SO QUANTUM SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB Quantum non-Gaussian states of phononic systems coupled to light are essential for fundamental studies of single-phonon mechanics and direct applications in quantum technology. Although nonclassical mechanical states have already been demonstrated, the more challenging quantum non-Gaussianity of such states remains limited. Using photon counting detection, we propose the quantum non-Gaussian generation of few-phonon states of low-temperature vibrating superfluid Helium. We predict the quantum non-Gaussian depth of such phononic states and investigate their robustness under relevant mechanical heating. As the quality of such phononic states is very high, we confirm a single-phonon bunching capability to further classify such states for future mechanical experiments. Moreover, we predict increasing capability for force sensing and thermometry for increasing heralded phonon numbers.

TI Rydberg-atom experiment for the integer factorization problem
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB The task of factoring integers poses a significant challenge in modern cryptography, and quantum computing holds the potential to efficiently address this problem compared to classical algorithms. Thus, it is crucial to develop quantum computing algorithms to address this problem. This study introduces a quantum approach that utilizes Rydberg atoms to tackle the factorization problem. Experimental demonstrations are conducted for the factorization of small composite numbers such as 6 = 2 x 3, 15 = 3 x 5, and 35 = 5 x 7. This approach involves employing Rydberg-atom graphs to algorithmically program binary multiplication tables, yielding many-body ground states that represent superpositions of factoring solutions. Subsequently, these states are probed using quantum adiabatic computing. Limitations of this method are discussed, specifically addressing the scalability of current Rydberg quantum computing for the intricate computational problem.

TI Adaptive Variational Quantum Imaginary Time Evolution Approach for
   Ground State Preparation
SO ADVANCED QUANTUM TECHNOLOGIES
AB An adaptive variational quantum imaginary time evolution (AVQITE) approach is introduced that yields efficient representations of ground states for interacting Hamiltonians on near-term quantum computers. It is based on McLachlan's variational principle applied to imaginary time evolution of variational wave functions. The variational parameters evolve deterministically according to equations of motions that minimize the difference to the exact imaginary time evolution, which is quantified by the McLachlan distance. Rather than working with a fixed variational ansatz, where the McLachlan distance is constrained by the quality of the ansatz, the AVQITE method iteratively expands the ansatz along the dynamical path to keep the McLachlan distance below a chosen threshold. This ensures the state is able to follow the quantum imaginary time evolution path in the system Hilbert space rather than in a restricted variational manifold set by a predefined fixed ansatz. AVQITE is used to prepare ground states of H-4, H2O, and BeH2 molecules, where it yields compact variational ansatze and ground state energies within chemical accuracy. Polynomial scaling of circuit depth with system size is shown through a set of AVQITE calculations of quantum spin models. Finally, quantum Lanczos calculations are demonstrated alongside AVQITE without additional quantum resource costs.

TI Measuring the quantum state of photoelectrons
SO NATURE PHOTONICS
AB A photoelectron, emitted due to the absorption of light quanta as described by the photoelectric effect, is often characterized experimentally by a classical quantity, its momentum. However, since the photoelectron is a quantum object, its rigorous characterization requires the reconstruction of the complete quantum state, the photoelectron's density matrix. Here we use quantum-state tomography to fully characterize photoelectrons emitted from helium and argon atoms upon absorption of ultrashort, extreme ultraviolet light pulses. While in helium we measure a pure photoelectronic state, in argon, spin-orbit interaction induces entanglement between the ion and the photoelectron, leading to a reduced purity of the photoelectron state. Our work shows how state tomography gives new insights into the fundamental quantum aspects of light-induced electronic processes in matter, bridging the fields of photoelectron spectroscopy and quantum information and offering new spectroscopic possibilities for quantum technology.

TI Machine Learning based Noise Characterization and Correction on Neutral
   Atoms NISQ Devices
SO ADVANCED QUANTUM TECHNOLOGIES
AB Neutral atoms devices represent a promising technology using optical tweezers to geometrically arrange atoms and modulated laser pulses to control their quantum states. They are exploited as noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) processors. Indeed, like all real quantum devices, they are affected by noise introducing errors in the computation. Therefore, it is important to understand and characterize the noise sources and possibly to correct them. Here, two machine-learning based approaches are proposed respectively to estimate the noise parameters and to mitigate their effects using only measurements of the final quantum state. Our analysis is then tested on a real neutral atom platform, comparing our predictions with a priori estimated parameters. It turns out that increasing the number of atoms is less effective than using more measurements on a smaller scale. The agreement is not always good but this may be due to the limited amount of real data that are obtained from a still under development device. Finally, reinforcement learning is employed to design a pulse that mitigates the noise effects. Our machine learning-based approach is espected to be very useful for the noise benchmarking of NISQ processors and, more in general, of real quantum technologies.
   Neutral atoms devices represent a promising technology that uses optical tweezers to arrange atoms and modulated laser pulses to control the quantum states. Two machine learning approaches are proposed to estimate the noise parameters and to mitigate the noise effects on such devices. The former is evaluated on simulated and real data and the latter do not require ancilla qubits.image

TI Fast-response low-power atomic oven for integration into an ion
   microchip
SO APPLIED PHYSICS LETTERS
AB We present a microfabricated neutral atom source for quantum technologies that can be easily integrated onto microchip devices using well-established micro-electromechanical systems fabrication techniques, and contrast this to conventional off-chip ion loading mechanisms. The heating filament of the device is shown to be as small as 90 x 90 mu m(2). Testing of the Yb-171 fluorescence response is found to be in the low tens of milliseconds, two orders of magnitude faster compared to previous literature at a power of milliwatts, making it desirable for low-power device packages. We demonstrate how the evaporation material can be capped in vacuum to work with materials such as Ba that oxidizes easily in air, which can avoid the need for ablation lasers in the loading process. We calculate oven lifetimes to be over 10 years of continuous use for commonly used ion species in quantum technology. (c) 2025 Author(s).

TI Highly-excited Rydberg excitons in synthetic thin-film cuprous oxide
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB Cuprous oxide (Cu2O) has recently emerged as a promising material in solid-state quantum technology, specifically for its excitonic Rydberg states characterized by large principal quantum numbers (n). The significant wavefunction size of these highly-excited states (proportional to n(2)) enables strong long-range dipole-dipole (proportional to n(4)) and van der Waals interactions (proportional to n(11)). Currently, the highest-lying Rydberg states are found in naturally occurring Cu2O. However, for technological applications, the ability to grow high-quality synthetic samples is essential. The fabrication of thin-film Cu2O samples is of particular interest as they hold potential for observing extreme single-photon nonlinearities through the Rydberg blockade. Nevertheless, due to the susceptibility of high-lying states to charged impurities, growing synthetic samples of sufficient quality poses a substantial challenge. This study successfully demonstrates the CMOS-compatible synthesis of a Cu2O thin film on a transparent substrate that showcases Rydberg excitons up to n = 8 which is readily suitable for photonic device fabrications. These findings mark a significant advancement towards the realization of scalable and on-chip integrable Rydberg quantum technologies.

TI Sequential generation of multiphoton entanglement with a Rydberg
   superatom
SO NATURE PHOTONICS
AB Up to six photons in a Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger state are sequentially generated by using a Rydberg superatom-a mesoscopic atomic ensemble under the condition of strong Rydberg blockade. The efficiency scaling factor for adding one photon is 0.27.
   Multiqubit entanglement is an indispensable resource for quantum information science. In particular, the entanglement of photons is of conceptual interest due to its implications in measurement-based quantum computing, communication and metrology. The traditional way of spontaneous parametric downconversion already demonstrates the entanglement of up to a dozen photons but is hindered by its probabilistic nature. Here we experimentally demonstrate an efficient approach for multiphoton generation with a Rydberg superatom, a mesoscopic atomic ensemble under Rydberg blockade. Using it as an efficient single-photon interface, we iterate the photon creation process that gives rise to a train of single photons entangled in the time-bin degree of freedom. Photon correlations verify entanglement up to six qubits. The overall efficiency to detect one photon is 9.4%. After correcting the measurement inefficiencies, we obtain a scaling factor of 27%, surpassing previous results and paving the way for larger-scale photonic entanglement.

TI Hyperfine interactions and coherent spin dynamics of isotopically
   purified 167Er3+ in polycrystalline
   Y2O3
SO MATERIALS FOR QUANTUM TECHNOLOGY
AB Er-167(3+) doped solids are a promising platform for quantum technology due to erbium's telecom C-band optical transition and its long hyperfine coherence times. We experimentally study the spin Hamiltonian and dynamics of Er-167(3+) spins in Y2O3 using electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy. The anisotropic electron Zeeman, hyperfine and nuclear quadrupole matrices are fitted using data obtained by X-band (9.5 GHz) EPR spectroscopy. We perform pulsed EPR spectroscopy to measure spin relaxation time T-1 and coherence time T-2 for the 3 principal axes of an anisotropic g tensor. Long electronic spin coherence time up to 24.4 mu s is measured for lowest g transition at 4 K, exceeding previously reported values at much lower temperatures. Measurements of decoherence mechanism indicates T-2 limited by spectral diffusion and instantaneous diffusion. Long spin coherence times, along with a strong anisotropic hyperfine interaction makes Er-167(3+):Y2O3 a rich system and an excellent candidate for spin-based quantum technologies.

TI Electromagnetic scattering controlled all-dielectric cavity-antenna for
   bright, directional, and purely radiative single-photon emission
SO JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYSICS
AB A deterministic, bright, room-temperature stable single-photon source (SPS) has been a major demand in the field of quantum photonics. Here, using computational and analytical techniques, we showed that the Mie-scattering moments of an all-dielectric cavity-cum-antenna help in shaping the spontaneous emission process of an embedded point-dipole emitter, the nanodiamond-based NV- and SiV color centers here. Our resonator-cum-antenna design comprises two top and bottom TiO2 cylinders with a sandwiched polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) layer enclosing the nanodiamond crystal. The Cartesian multi-polar decomposition of the Mie-scattering moments of the sandwiched PVA layer (enclosing the dipole emitter) with subwavelength scale thickness showed strong electric-dipole (ED) resonance. This resulted in significant field confinement, making the PVA layer to act as a cavity, providing a Purcell enhancement of more than an order of magnitude for all dipole orientations. The top and bottom TiO2 cylinders were observed to act as an antenna, and the far-field radiation pattern of the embedded dipole-emitter is controlled by the Mie-scattering moments of the TiO2 cylinders. The radiation directionality along the vertical directions was found to be maximum at the Kerker point (electric dipole moment, ED = magnetic dipole moment), the collection efficiency (CE) being about 80%. For dipole emission coupled to the antenna, the quantum efficiency was observed to increase to a high value of 0.98 for nanodiamond NV- center, very close to an ideal case of purely radiative emission. Our scheme is shown to be universal and can be applied to any solid-state-based quantum emitters, for generating on-demand SPS for quantum-photonic applications. (c) 2024 Author(s).

TI Engineering entangled photon pairs with metal-organic frameworks
SO CHEMICAL SCIENCE
AB The discovery and design of new materials with competitive optical frequency conversion efficiencies can accelerate the development of scalable photonic quantum technologies. Metal-organic framework (MOF) crystals without inversion symmetry have shown potential for these applications, given their nonlinear optical properties and the combinatorial number of possibilities for MOF self-assembly. In order to accelerate the discovery of MOF materials for quantum optical technologies, scalable computational assessment tools are needed. We develop a multi-scale methodology to study the wavefunction of entangled photon pairs generated by selected non-centrosymmetric MOF crystals via spontaneous parametric down-conversion (SPDC). Starting from an optimized crystal structure, we predict the shape of the G(2) intensity correlation function for coincidence detection of the entangled pairs, produced under conditions of collinear type-I phase matching. The effective nonlinearities and photon pair correlation times obtained are comparable to those available with inorganic crystal standards. Our work thus provides fundamental insights into the structure-property relationships for entangled photon generation with metal-organic frameworks, paving the way for the automated discovery of molecular materials for optical quantum technology.

TI Electromagnetically Induced Transparency Cooling of High-Nuclear-Spin
   Ions
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB We report the electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT) cooling of Ba-137(+) ions with a nuclear spin of I = 3/2, which are a good candidate of qubits for future large-scale trapped-ion quantum computing. EIT cooling of atoms or ions with a complex ground-state level structure is challenging due to the lack of an isolated Lambda system, as the population can escape from the Lambda system to reduce the cooling efficiency. We overcome this issue by leveraging an EIT pumping laser to repopulate the cooling subspace, ensuring continuous and effective EIT cooling. We cool the two radial modes of a single Ba-137(+) ion to average motional occupations of 0.08(5) and 0.15(7), respectively. Using the same laser parameters, we also cool all the ten radial modes of a five-ion chain to near their ground states. Our approach can be adapted to atomic species possessing similar level structures. It allows engineering of the EIT Fano-like spectrum, which can be useful for simultaneous cooling of modes across a wide frequency range, aiding in large-scale trapped-ion quantum information processing.

TI Algorithmic Cluster Expansions for Quantum Problems
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB We establish a general framework for developing approximation algorithms for a class of counting problems. Our framework is based on the cluster expansion of the abstract polymer model formalism of KoteckATIN SMALL LETTER Y WITH ACUTE and Preiss. We apply our framework to obtain efficient algorithms for (1) approximating probability amplitudes of a class of quantum circuits close to the identity, (2) approximating expectation values of a class of quantum circuits with operators close to the identity, (3) approximating partition functions of a class of quantum spin systems at high temperature, and (4) approximating thermal expectation values of a class of quantum spin systems at high temperature with positive-semidefinite operators. Further, we obtain hardness of approximation results for approximating probability amplitudes of quantum circuits and partition functions of quantum spin systems. This establishes a computational complexity transition for these problems and shows that our algorithmic conditions are optimal under complexity-theoretic assumptions. Finally, we show that our algorithmic condition is almost optimal for expectation values and optimal for thermal expectation values in the sense of zero freeness.

TI Observability of fidelity decay at the Lyapunov rate in few-qubit
   quantum simulations
SO QUANTUM
AB In certain regimes, the fidelity of quantum states will decay at a rate set by the classical Lyapunov exponent. This serves both as one of the most important examples of the quantum-classical correspondence principle and as an accurate test for the presence of chaos. While detecting this phenomenon is one of the first useful calculations that noisy quantum computers without error correction can perform [G. Benenti et al., Phys. Rev. E 65, 066205 (2001)], a thorough study of the quantum sawtooth map reveals that observing the Lyapunov regime is just beyond the reach of present-day devices. We prove that there are three bounds on the ability of any device to observe the Lyapunov regime and give the first quantitatively accurate description of these bounds: (1) the Fermi golden rule decay rate must be larger than the Lyapunov rate, (2) the quantum dynamics must be diffusive rather than localized, and (3) the initial decay rate must be slow enough for Lyapunov decay to be observable. This last bound, which has not been recognized previously, places a limit on the maximum amount of noise that can be tolerated. The theory implies that an absolute minimum of 6 qubits is required. Recent experiments on IBM-Q and IonQ imply that some combination of a noise reduction by up to 100x per gate and large increases in connectivity and gate parallelization are also necessary. Finally, scaling arguments are given that quantify the ability of future devices to observe the Lyapunov regime based on trade-offs between hardware architecture and performance.

TI Occam's razor description of sudden energy transitions in a Rabi-driven
   quantum bit under frequent observation
SO PHYSICA E-LOW-DIMENSIONAL SYSTEMS & NANOSTRUCTURES
AB The fundamental law of parsimony in science, which is colloquially referred to as Occam's razor, gives precedence to simplicity in the development of a theory. We wish to illustrate this principle by revisiting the issue related to the long-lasting continuous experimental measurement of a Rabi-driven qubit (Minev et al., 2019). We propose a simple and basic explanation of the results that proceeds from the variance property of the Hamiltonian in the case of a weak Rabi drive. This variance provides a large statistical time-dependent range of available values for the qubit energy (namely, its standard deviation) that spreads out about Rabi's well-known harmonic state-flipping mean value. In the presence of a long-lasting continuous measurement process like in Minev et al experiment, the resulting "quantum Zeno freezing"of the observed system keeps its energy frozen in its initial state as long as this remains possible within the standard deviation of the energy. Otherwise the system suddenly experiences a quantum jump between the two energy levels - dubbed a quantum Zeno jump - in order to resume its state-freezing dynamics. Some link is made with the dynamics of swapping gates in quantum information processing.

TI Enhanced Phonon Antibunching in a Circuit Quantum Acoustodynamical
   System Containing Two Surface Acoustic Wave Resonators
SO MICROMACHINES
AB We propose a scheme to implement the phonon antibunching and phonon blockade in a circuit quantum acoustodynamical system containing two surface acoustic wave (SAW) resonators coupled to a superconducting qubit. In the cases of driving only one SAW resonator and two SAW resonators, we investigate the phonon statistics by numerically calculating the second-order correlation function. It is found that, when only one SAW cavity is resonantly driven, the phonon antibunching effect can be achieved even when the qubit-phonon coupling strength is smaller than the decay rates of acoustic cavities. This result physically originates from the quantum interference between super-Poissonian statistics and Poissonian statistics of phonons. In particular, when the two SAW resonators are simultaneously driven under the mechanical resonant condition, the phonon antibunching effect can be significantly enhanced, which ultimately allows for the generation of a phonon blockade. Moreover, the obtained phonon blockade can be optimized by regulating the intensity ratio of the two SAW driving fields. In addition, we also discuss in detail the effect of system parameters on the phonon statistics. Our work provides an alternative way for manipulating and controlling the nonclassical effects of SAW phonons. It may inspire the engineering of new SAW-based phonon devices and extend their applications in quantum information processing.

TI An algebraic method to fidelity-based model checking over quantum Markov
   chains
SO THEORETICAL COMPUTER SCIENCE
AB Fidelity is one of the most widely used quantities in quantum information that measures the distance of two quantum states through a noisy channel, a kind of quantum operations. In this paper, we consider the model of quantum Markov chain (QMC), in which transitions are weighted by super-operators to characterize quantum operations and the initial quantum state is left parametric. A quantum analogy of probabilistic computation tree logic, called QCTL, is introduced to take into account fidelity, instead of probability measure, over QMC. The key to the model checking problem lies in computing the fidelity of the super-operator valued measure specified by a path formula in QCTL. It is minimized over all initial quantum states, which is intended for analyzing the system performance in the worst case. We achieve it by a reduction to quantifier elimination in the existential theory of the reals. The method is absolutely exact, so that model checking QCTL formulas against QMCs is proved to be decidable in exponential time.(c) 2022 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Engineering strong beamsplitter interaction between bosonic modes via
   quantum optimal control theory
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB In continuous-variable quantum computing with qubits encoded in the infinite-dimensional Hilbert space of bosonic modes, it is a difficult task to realize strong and on-demand interactions between the qubits. One option is to engineer a beamsplitter interaction for photons in two superconducting cavities by driving an intermediate superconducting circuit with two continuous-wave drives, as demonstrated in a recent experiment [Gao et al., Phys. Rev. X 8, 021073 (2018)]. Here we show how quantum optimal control theory (OCT) can be used in a systematic way to improve the beamsplitter interaction between the two cavities. We find that replacing the two-tone protocol by a three-tone protocol accelerates the effective beamsplitter rate between the two cavities. The third tone's amplitude and frequency are determined by gradient-free optimization and make use of cavity-transmon sideband couplings. We show how to further improve the three-tone protocol via gradient-based optimization while keeping the optimized drives experimentally feasible. Our work exemplifies how to use OCT to systematically improve practical protocols in quantum information applications.

TI Large-bandwidth Transduction Between an Optical Single Quantum Dot
   Molecule and a Superconducting Resonator
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB Quantum transduction between the microwave and optical domains is an outstanding challenge for long-distance quantum networks based on superconducting qubits. For all transducers realized to date, the generally weak light-matter coupling does not allow high transduction efficiency, large bandwidth, and low noise simultaneously. Here we show that a large electric dipole moment of an exciton in an optically active self-assembled quantum dot molecule (QDM) efficiently couples to a microwave resonator field at the single-photon level. This allows for transduction between microwave and optical photons without coherent optical pump fields to enhance the interaction. With an on-chip device, we demonstrate a sizeable single-photon coupling strength of 16 MHz. Thanks to the fast exciton decay in the QDM, the transduction bandwidth between an optical and microwave resonator photon reaches several 100 s of MHz. We also show that the transduction process via the QDM is fully coherent within the measurement error range.

TI Bottom-up fabrication of 2D Rydberg exciton arrays in cuprous oxide
SO COMMUNICATIONS MATERIALS
AB Solid-state platforms provide exceptional opportunities for advancing on-chip quantum technologies by enhancing interaction strengths through coupling, scalability, and robustness. Cuprous oxide (Cu2O) has recently emerged as a promising medium for scalable quantum technology due to its high-lying Rydberg excitonic states, akin to those in hydrogen atoms. To harness these nonlinearities for quantum applications, the confinement dimensions must match the Rydberg blockade size, which can reach several microns in Cu2O. Using a CMOS-compatible growth technique, this study demonstrates the bottom-up fabrication of site-selective arrays of Cu2O microparticles. We observed Rydberg excitons up to the principal quantum number n = 5 within these Cu2O arrays on a quartz substrate and analyzed the spatial variation of their spectrum across the array, showing robustness and reproducibility on a large chip. These results lay the groundwork for the deterministic growth of Cu2O around photonic structures, enabling substantial light-matter interaction on integrated photonic platforms and paving the way for scalable, on-chip quantum devices.

AB Significant attention in the PER community has been paid to student cognition and reasoning processes in undergraduate quantum mechanics. Until recently, however, these same topics have remained largely unexplored in the context of emerging interdisciplinary quantum information science (QIS) courses. We conducted exploratory interviews with 22 students in an upper-division quantum computing course at a large R1 university crosslisted in physics and computer science, as well as 6 graduate students in a similar graduate-level QIS course offered in physics. We classify and analyze students' responses to a pair of questions regarding the fundamental differences between classical and quantum computers. We specifically note two key themes of importance to educators: (1) when reasoning about computational power, students often struggled to distinguish between the relative effects of exponential and linear scaling, resulting in students frequently focusing on distinctions that are arguably better understood as analog-digital than classical-quantum, and (2) introducing the thought experiment of analog classical computers was a powerful tool for helping students develop a more expertlike perspective on the differences between classical and quantum computers.

TI Autler-Townes splitting in the trap-loss fluorescence spectroscopy due
   to single-step direct Rydberg excitation of cesium cold atomic ensemble
SO AIP ADVANCES
AB We experimentally investigate trap-loss spectra of the cesium 6S(1/2)(F = 4) ? 71P(3/2) Rydberg transition by combining the cesium atomic magneto-optical trap with the narrow-linewidth, continuously tunable 318.6 nm ultraviolet laser. Specifically, the atoms in the magneto-optical trap are excited to the Rydberg state due to the ultraviolet laser single-step Rydberg excitation, which leads to the reduction of atomic fluorescence. Based on the trap-loss spectroscopy technology, the Autler-Townes (AT) splitting due to a strong cooling laser is observed, and the parameter dependence of the AT splitting interval of trap-loss spectroscopy is investigated. The effective temperature of cold atoms is measured by using simplified time-of-flight fluorescence imaging. In addition, closed-loop feedback power stabilization of 318.6 nm ultraviolet laser is carried out. This lays the foundation for further experimental research related to the Rydberg atoms using ultraviolet lasers, which is of great significance for the development of quantum computing and quantum information.

TI Quantum Complexity of the Kronecker Coefficients
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB Whether or not the Kronecker coefficients of the symmetric group count some set of combinatorial objects is a longstanding open question. In this work we show that a given Kronecker coefficient is proportional to the rank of a projector that can be measured efficiently using a quantum computer. In other words a Kronecker coefficient counts the dimension of the vector space spanned by the accepting witnesses of a QMA verifier, where QMA is the quantum analogue of NP. This implies that approximating the Kronecker coefficients to within a given relative error is not harder than a certain natural class of quantum approximate counting problems that captures the complexity of estimating thermal properties of quantum many-body systems. A second consequence is that deciding positivity of Kronecker coefficients is contained in QMA, complementing a recent NP-hardness result of Ikenmeyer, Mulmuley, and Walter. We obtain similar results for the related problem of approximating row sums of the character table of the symmetric group. Finally, we discuss an efficient quantum algorithm that approximates normalized Kronecker coefficients to inverse-polynomial additive error.

TI Quantum state transport in a square-lattice superconducting qubit
   circuit under gauge potential
SO ACTA PHYSICA SINICA
AB In this paper, we study the transport properties of quantum states in the square-lattice quantum bit model by using inductive couplers to generate the artificial gauge potential (effective magnetic flux). It is found by theoretical calculation that the eigenstates of single particle and single hole have the same eigen energy spectrum, and the average particle and hole currents, sinusoidally modulated by the effective magnetic flux, are opposite to each other with respect to the same eigen energy. For an initial single-particle or single-hole state where only one lattice site is occuplied, if the time-inversion symmetry is preserved (the effective magnetic flux is an integral multiple of 4 & pi;), the components of the time-dependent wave functions of the single particle and the single hole are equal, otherwise they are not equal. The analysis demonstrates that the above calculation results are due to the fact that the particle-hole operation for the system Hamiltonian is equivalent to the time inversion. In addition, it is found that when the effective magnetic flux is & pi;, a single particle or a single hole is only transported between the initial bit and two adjacent bits, and when the effective magnetic flux is 0, a single particle or a single hole is transported to the diagonal bit through two adjacent bits, and then transported in reverse. Regardless of the value of effective magnetic flux, both the single-particle and single-hole states share the same average (particle or hole) current and lattice site occupation probability.

TI Experimental validation of boson sampling using detector binning
SO QUANTUM SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB We experimentally demonstrate a testing strategy for boson samplers that is based on efficiently computable expressions for the output photon counting distributions binned over multiple optical modes. We apply this method to validate boson sampling experiments with three photons on a reconfigurable photonic chip, which implements a four-mode interferometer, analyzing 50 Haar-random unitary transformations while tuning photon indistinguishability via controlled delays. We show that for (nearly) indistinguishable photons, the experiment accurately reproduces the ideal boson sampling binned-mode distributions, which exhibit variations that depend both on the specific interferometer implemented as well as the choice of bin, confirming the usefulness of the method to diagnose imperfections such as partial distinguishability or imperfect chip control. Finally, we analyze the behavior of Haar-averaged binned-mode distributions in relation to indistinguishability and demonstrate analytically that its variance is proportional to the average of the square of the photons' indistinguishability parameter. These findings highlight the central role of binning in boson sampling validation, offering a scalable and efficient framework for assessing multiphoton interference and experimental performance.

TI Exact Time Evolution of Genuine Multipartite Correlations for N-Qubit
   Systems in a Common Thermal Reservoir
SO QUANTUM REPORTS
AB We investigate the dynamical evolution of genuine multipartite correlations for N-qubits in a common reservoir considering a non-dissipative qubits-reservoir model. We derive an exact expression for the time-evolved density matrix by modeling the reservoir as a set of infinite harmonic oscillators with a bilinear form of interaction Hamiltonian. Interestingly, we find that the choice of two-level systems corresponding to an initially correlated multipartite state plays a significant role in potential robustness against environmental decoherence. In particular, the generalized W-class Werner state shows robustness against the decoherence for an equivalent set of qubits, whereas a certain generalized GHZ-class Werner state shows robustness for inequivalent sets of qubits. It is shown that the genuine multipartite concurrence (GMC), a measure of multipartite entanglement of an initially correlated multipartite state, experiences an irreversible decay of correlations in the presence of a thermal reservoir. For the GHZ-class Werner state, the region of mixing parameters for which there exists GMC, shrinks with time and with increase in the temperature of the thermal reservoir. Furthermore, we study the dynamical evolution of the relative entropy of coherence and von-Neumann entropy for the W-class Werner state.

TI Quantum Fourier analysis for multivariate functions and applications to
   a class of Schrodinger-type partial differential equations
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB In this work we develop a highly efficient representation of functions and differential operators based on Fourier analysis. Using this representation, we create a variational hybrid quantum algorithm to solve static, Schrodinger-type, Hamiltonian partial differential equations (PDEs), using space-efficient variational circuits, including the symmetries of the problem, and global and gradient-based optimizers. We use this algorithm to benchmark the performance of the representation techniques by means of the computation of the ground state in three PDEs, i.e., the one-dimensional quantum harmonic oscillator and the transmon and flux qubits, studying how they would perform in ideal and near-term quantum computers. With the Fourier methods developed here, we obtain low infidelities of order 10(-4)-10(-5) using only three to four qubits, demonstrating the high compression of information in a quantum computer. Practical fidelities are limited by the noise and the errors of the evaluation of the cost function in real computers, but they can also be improved through error mitigation techniques.

TI Stationary and dynamical entanglements in microcavity exciton polaritons
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB We propose a scheme for generating genuinely tripartite entanglements in microcavity exciton polaritons comprised of an exciton, photon, and phonon modes. We search for robust stationary bipartite and tripartite entanglements by optimizing optomechanical parameters while revealing the mechanism for generating entangled states by non-Hermitian spectrum. Maximum photon-phonon and exciton-phonon bipartite entanglements appear at the cross points of real eigenvalues in the non-Hermitian spectrum, while photon-exciton bipartite entanglements and tripartite entanglements are related to the breaking of parity-time symmetry. We also demonstrate entanglement dynamics and discover entanglement oscillations, transformation, and sudden death. Entanglement transformation among different bipartite entanglements and entanglement sudden death can be effectively regulated by cavity-exciton detunings and exciton-photonphonon couplings. Moreover, thermal noises should be degraded to generate robust stationary entanglements and maintain prolonged dynamical entanglements. Our results open up new possibilities for constructing exciton-photon-phonon tripartite entanglements, which may have potential applications in developing quantum computing and quantum information processing protocols based on macroscopic entangled states.

TI A continuous variable Born machine
SO QUANTUM MACHINE INTELLIGENCE
AB Generative modelling has become a promising use case for near-term quantum computers. Due to the fundamentally probabilistic nature of quantum mechanics, quantum computers naturally model and learn probability distributions, perhaps more efficiently than can be achieved classically. The quantum circuit Born machine is an example of such a model, easily implemented on near-term quantum computers. However, the Born machine was originally defined to naturally represent discrete distributions. Since probability distributions of a continuous nature are commonplace in the world, it is essential to have a model which can efficiently represent them. Some proposals have been made in the literature to supplement the discrete Born machine with extra features to more easily learn continuous distributions; however, all invariably increase the resources required. In this work, we discuss the continuous variable Born machine, built on the alternative architecture of continuous variable quantum computing, which is much more suitable for modelling such distributions in a resource-minimal way. We provide numerical results indicating the model's ability to learn both quantum and classical continuous distributions, including in the presence of noise.

TI Composite-pulse enhanced room-temperature diamond magnetometry
SO FUNCTIONAL DIAMOND
AB The sensitivity of practical solid quantum sensing can be boosted up by increasing the number of probes. However, the effects of spin dephasing caused by inhomogeneous broadening and imperfect quantum control can reduce the fidelity of quantum control and the sensitivity of quantum sensing with the dense ensemble of probes, such as nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamond. Here, we present a robust and effective composite-pulse for high fidelity operation against inhomogeneous broadening and control errors via optimized modulation of the control field. Such a composite-pulse was verified on NV center to keep high fidelity quantum control up to a spectrum detuning as large as 110% of Rabi frequency. The sensitivity of the magnetometer with NV center ensemble was experimentally improved by a factor of 4, comparing to dynamical decoupling with a normal rectangular pulse. Our work marks an important step towards high trustworthy ultra-sensitive quantum sensing with imperfect quantum control in practical applications. The used principle is universal and not restricted to NV center ensemble magnetometer.

TI Toward a QUBO-Based Density Matrix Electronic Structure Method
SO JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL THEORY AND COMPUTATION
AB Density matrix electronic structure theory is used in many quantum chemistry methods to "alleviate" the computational cost that arises from directly using wave functions. Although density matrix based methods are computationally more efficient than wave function based methods, significant computational effort is involved. Because the Schrodinger equation needs to be solved as an eigenvalue problem, the time-to-solution scales cubically with the system size in mean-field type approaches such as Hartree-Fock and density functional theory and is solved as many times in order to reach charge or field self-consistency. We hereby propose and study a method to compute the density matrix by using a quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO) solver. This method could be useful to solve the problem with quantum computers and, more specifically, quantum annealers. Our proposed approach is based on a direct construction of the density matrix using a QUBO eigensolver. We explore the main parameters of the algorithm focusing on precision and efficiency. We show that, while direct construction of the density matrix using a QUBO formulation is possible, the efficiency and precision have room for improvement. Moreover, calculations performed with quantum annealing on D-Wave's new Advantage quantum computer are compared with results obtained with classical simulated annealing, further highlighting some problems of the proposed method. We also suggest alternative methods that could lead to a more efficient QUBO-based density matrix construction.

TI Effective descriptions of bosonic systems can be considered complete
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Bosonic statistics give rise to remarkable phenomena, from the Hong-Ou-Mandel effect to Bose-Einstein condensation, with applications spanning fundamental science to quantum technologies. Modeling bosonic systems relies heavily on effective descriptions: typically, truncating their infinite-dimensional state space or restricting their dynamics to a simple class of Hamiltonians, such as polynomials of canonical operators. However, many natural bosonic Hamiltonians do not belong to these simple classes, and some quantum effects harnessed by bosonic computers inherently require infinite-dimensional spaces. Can we trust that results obtained with such simplifying assumptions capture real effects? We solve this outstanding problem, showing that these effective descriptions do correctly capture the physics of bosonic systems. Our technical contributions are twofold: firstly, we prove that any physical bosonic unitary evolution can be accurately approximated by a finite-dimensional unitary evolution; secondly, we show that any finite-dimensional unitary evolution can be generated exactly by a bosonic Hamiltonian that is a polynomial of canonical operators. Beyond their fundamental significance, our results have implications for classical and quantum simulations of bosonic systems, provide universal methods for engineering bosonic quantum states and Hamiltonians, show that polynomial Hamiltonians generate universal gate sets for quantum computing over bosonic modes, and lead to a bosonic Solovay-Kitaev theorem.

TI A map of cavity magnonics: concepts, developments, and recent advances
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICS-CONDENSED MATTER
AB Recent developments in the field of cavity magnonics are surveyed with a focus on emerging topics of particular interest for application to information technologies. The review begins with a brief tutorial, providing a conceptual foundation useful for understanding cavity magnon-polaritons. More detailed discussions follow that target directions that have received increasing attention in recent years. These topics include remote and long-distance coupling, topological magnonics, non-reciprocity, and explorations of these phenomena for quantum and single magnon regimes. Interest in this area is driven in large part by a combination of modern nano-fabrication techniques with microwave active materials in order to engineer new functionality and phenomena in forms useful for application across a range of classical and quantum technologies. Moreover, advances in the ability to control the coupling between photons and cavity magnons is creating an exciting playground within which to explore new physics enabled by precision studies of cavity magnon-polaritons. From an applications perspective, these studies are also important for information technologies due to a great potential to store, transfer, and manipulate information encoded in spin states, thereby offering unique advantages as platforms for power-efficient classical and quantum computing.

TI Computational Materials Insights Into Solid-State Multiqubit Systems
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB The field of materials for quantum information science is rapidly growing with a focus on scaling and integrating new solid-state qubits. However, despite the extraordinary progress, major challenges must still be overcome for scaling. Specifically, there is a critical need for efficient coupling of tens to hundreds of solid-state qubits and multiqubit error correction to mitigate environmental interactions. This Perspective looks forward to the challenges ahead in the realization of multiqubit operations and collective phenomena with a focus on solid-state quantum materials. We provide a theorists' point of view on the modeling and rational design of these multiqubit systems. Our Perspective identifies a path for bridging the gap between the model Hamiltonians used to develop quantum algorithms and control sequences and the ab initio calculations used to understand and characterize single solid-state-based qubits.

TI α-RuCl3 and other Kitaev materials
SO APL MATERIALS
AB Quantum spin liquids have been drawing much attention in recent years as a platform to develop future quantum technologies, such as topological quantum computing. In particular, Kitaev's honeycomb model has provided a blueprint to realize a quantum spin liquid that has Majorana fermions as its elementary excitation. While numerous theoretical studies have shown intriguing properties of quantum spin liquids, an experimental realization remains elusive. The recent observation of the quantized thermal Hall effect in alpha-RuCl(3 )has brought us tantalizingly close to an experimental realization of Kitaev quantum spin liquids. However, various groups report conflicting results, indicating that the Kitaev quantum spin liquid phase might be very fragile and its properties strongly depend on the sample. Here, we present a short overview of the rise of alpha-RuCl3 as a prime candidate material for realizing Kitaev quantum spin liquids. There are already many excellent review papers on this topic, so the emphasis will be on the materials aspect, comparing different crystal growth methods and crystal morphologies. We also discuss current research attempts to find other candidate materials to realize Kitaev quantum spin liquids, mostly focused on 3d transition-metal compounds, such as transition-metal halides and layered cobalt compounds.

TI Interaction graph engineering in trapped-ion quantum simulators with
   global drives
SO NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB Trapped-ion quantum simulators have demonstrated a long history of studying the physics of interacting spin-lattice systems using globally addressed entangling operations. Yet despite the multitude of studies so far, most have been limited to studying variants of the same spin interaction model, namely an Ising model with power-law decay in the couplings. Here, we demonstrate that much broader classes of effective spin-spin interactions are achievable using exclusively global driving fields. Specifically, we find that these new categories of interaction graphs become achievable with perfect or near-perfect theoretical fidelity by tailoring the coupling of the driving fields to each vibrational mode of the ion crystal. Given the relation between the ion crystal vibrational modes and the accessible interaction graphs, we show how the accessible interaction graph set can be further expanded by shaping the trapping potential to include specific anharmonic terms. Finally, we derive a rigorous test to determine whether a desired interaction graph is accessible using only globally driven fields. These tools broaden the reach of trapped-ion quantum simulators so that they may more easily address open questions in materials science and quantum chemistry.

SO PHYSICS-USPEKHI
AB Today, precise laser control of the quantum states of single ions cooled to low temperatures in traps ensures significant progress in the development of such physical areas as optical and microwave frequency standards, quantum computing, and accurate measurements of transition frequencies to confirm fundamental physical theories. Pioneering ideas about the possibility of using lasers in the development of frequency standards, expressed in the 1960s by the Nobel laureate N G Basov, have enjoyed rapid development: the relative accuracy of frequency standards has reached the 18th decimal place, and the experimentally demonstrated coherence time of narrow optical transitions amounts to tens of seconds. The paper presents a selective review, as well as the results of research at the Lebedev Physical Institute, in the area of using elements of quantum logic in the action of coherent laser pulses on single ions. Also discussed is the use of quantum logic methods in optical clocks based on the Al+ ion and the multiply charged Al+ ion, and also in quantum computers based on Ca+ and Yb+ ions.

TI A double quantum dot defined by top gates in a single crystalline InSb
   nanosheet*
SO CHINESE PHYSICS B
AB We report on the transport study of a double quantum dot (DQD) device made from a freestanding, single crystalline InSb nanosheet. The freestanding nanosheet is grown by molecular beam epitaxy and the DQD is defined by the top gate technique. Through the transport measurements, we demonstrate how a single quantum dot (QD) and a DQD can be defined in an InSb nanosheet by tuning voltages applied to the top gates. We also measure the charge stability diagrams of the DQD and show that the charge states and the inter-dot coupling between the two individual QDs in the DQD can be efficiently regulated by the top gates. Numerical simulations for the potential profile and charge density distribution in the DQD have been performed and the results support the experimental findings and provide a better understanding of fabrication and transport characteristics of the DQD in the InSb nanosheet. The achieved DQD in the two-dimensional InSb nanosheet possesses pronounced benefits in lateral scaling and can thus serve as a new building block for the developments of quantum computation and quantum simulation technologies.

TI Quantum-Optimized Probabilistic U-Net With Quantum Entropy Calibration
   and Active Annotation for Reliable Sparse-Label MRI Brain Lesion
   Segmentations
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB Accurate and trustworthy segmentation of brain lesions in multimodal MRI is crucial for clinical decisions, yet most datasets carry only sparse voxel-level annotations. Conventional probabilistic U-Nets and classical uncertainty calibration struggle in this regime, often underestimating epistemic uncertainty and failing to preserve fine-grained topology or cross-scanner consistency sets. To overcome these limits, we present a Quantum-Optimized Probabilistic U-Net (Q-PUNet) equipped with a suite of quantum Inspired modules that address the main failure points of current practice sets. At its core, Quantum Entropy-Guided Uncertainty Calibration (QE-UC) embeds features into a Hilbert space and minimizes the Kullback-Leibler divergence between von Neumann entropy and Monte Carlo variance, refining confidence maps when labels are scarce. To reduce the cost of expert supervision, a Variational Quantum Active Annotation Loop (VQ-AAL) scores voxel importance via quantum Fisher information and queries only the most informative regions, lowering annotation workload by roughly 40 % without sacrificing Dice accuracy. Structural reliability is reinforced through Quantum Mutual Information Consistency Validation (Q-MICV), which encodes adjacent slices as quantum states and penalizes inter-slice mutual Information mismatches, improving 3-D coherence. For multi-center data, Hybrid Quantum-Classical Adversarial Domain Harmonization (HQADH) combines quantum kernel mapping with an adversarial discriminator to suppress scanner-specific artifacts, while Quantum Inspired Topological Persistence Regularization (Q-TPR) leverages quantum annealing of persistent homology to maintain correct Betti numbers and lesion topology sets. This integrated design raises expected Dice scores from 0.84 to about 0.89, cuts calibration error by up to 25 %, and improves cross-site generalization and topological fidelity. The framework delivers a practical route toward reliable, annotation-efficient, and clinically robust MRI lesion segmentations.

TI Mutually unbiased balanced functions and generalized random access codes
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Quantum resources and protocols are known to outperform their classical counterparts in a variety of communication and information processing tasks. Random access codes (RACs) are one such cryptographically significant family of bipartite communication tasks, wherein the sender encodes a data set (typically a string of input bits) onto a physical system of bounded dimension and transmits it to the receiver, who then attempts to guess a randomly chosen part of the sender's data set (typically one of the sender's input bits). In this work, we introduce a generalization of this task wherein the receiver, in addition to the individual input bits, aims to retrieve randomly chosen functions of the sender's input string. Specifically, we employ sets of mutually unbiased balanced functions, such that perfect knowledge of any one of the constituent functions yields no knowledge about the others. We investigate and bound the performance of (i) classical, (ii) quantum prepare and measure, and (iii) entanglement assisted classical communication (EACC) protocols for the resultant generalized RACs (GRACs). Finally, we detail the case of GRACs with three input bits and find maximal success probabilities for classical, quantum, and EACC protocols, along with the effect of noisy quantum channels on the performance of quantum protocols. Moreover, with the help of this case study, we reveal several characteristic properties of the GRACs which deviate from the standard RACs.

TI Computationally Secure Semi-Quantum All-Or-Nothing Oblivious Transfer
   from Dihedral Coset States
SO ADVANCED QUANTUM TECHNOLOGIES
AB The quest for perfect quantum oblivious transfer (QOT) with information-theoretic security remains a challenge, necessitating the exploration of computationally secure QOT as a viable alternative. Unlike the unconditionally secure quantum key distribution (QKD), the computationally secure QOT relies on specific quantum-safe computational hardness assumptions, such as the post-quantum hardness of learning with errors (LWE) problem and quantum-hard one-way functions. This raises an intriguing question: Are there additional efficient quantum hardness assumptions that are suitable for QOT? In this work, leveraging the dihedral coset state derived from the dihedral coset problem (DCP), a basic variant of OT, known as the all-or-nothing OT, is studied in the semi-quantum setting. Specifically, the DCP originates from the dihedral hidden subgroup problem (DHSP), conjectured to be challenging for any quantum polynomial-time algorithms. First, a computationally secure quantum protocol is presented for all-or-nothing OT, which is then simplified into a semi-quantum OT protocol with minimal quantumness, where the interaction needs merely classical communication. To efficiently instantiate the dihedral coset state, a powerful cryptographic tool called the LWE-based noisy trapdoor claw-free functions (NTCFs) is used. The construction requires only a three-message interaction and ensures perfect statistical privacy for the receiver and computational privacy for the sender.

TI Optimal solving of a binary knapsack problem on a D-Wave quantum machine
   and its implementation in production systems
SO ANNALS OF OPERATIONS RESEARCH
AB The efficient management of complex production systems is a challenge in today's logistics. In the field of intelligent and sustainable logistics, the optimization of production batches, especially in the context of a rapidly changing product range, requires fast and precise computational solutions. This paper explores the potential of quantum computers for solving these problems. Traditional computational methods are often limited when it comes to optimizing complex logistics systems. In response to these challenges, the paper proposes the use of a hybrid algorithm that combines quantum technologies with classical computational methods. Such integration allows the computational power of both types of technologies to be harnessed, leading to faster and more efficient identification of optimal solutions. In this work, we consider the knapsack problem, a classic NP-hard optimization problem that is commonly used to verify the effectiveness of new algorithm construction methods. The algorithm presented is based on the Branch and Bound method and aims to ensure solution optimality in the context of the non-determinism of quantum computers. Within the algorithm, computations are performed alternately on a classical processor and a quantum processor. In addition, the lower and upper bounds of the objective function are computed in constant time using the D-Wave quantum machine.

   SCIENCES
AB A diversity of experimental techniques has been developed over the last 25 years to create samples of molecular gases at temperatures close to the Absolute Zero-here we consider samples in the range from 10s of Kelvin (cold) down to 10s of nanoKelvin (ultracold). In these exotic physical environments, a range of novel experiments can be conducted which bring high levels of control over the properties of these 'almost stationary' molecules, in some cases with control over single trapped molecules achievable. In this article, recent advances in this field since 2020, both in terms of the ability to produce and manipulate the molecules and understand their properties, and also in the development of new applications of these technologies, are highlighted. Applications include observing explicit 'quantum effects' in chemical reactivity, developing an understanding of chemistry in cold astrophysical media, the creation of exotic phases of matter, the use of trapped molecules in quantum computation and simulations systems, and the use of very high-precision spectroscopic measurements to answer fundamental physics questions beyond the standard model of particle physics.

TI Experimental quantum secret sharing based on phase encoding of coherent
   states
SO SCIENCE CHINA-PHYSICS MECHANICS & ASTRONOMY
AB Quantum secret sharing (QSS) is one of the basic communication primitives in future quantum networks which addresses part of the basic cryptographic tasks of multiparty communication and computation. Nevertheless, it is a challenge to provide a practical QSS protocol with security against general attacks. A QSS protocol that balances security and practicality is still lacking. Here, we propose a QSS protocol with simple phase encoding of coherent states among three parties. Removing the requirement of impractical entangled resources and the need for phase randomization, our protocol can be implemented with accessible technology. We provide the finite-key analysis against coherent attacks and implement a proof-of-principle experiment to demonstrate our scheme's feasibility. Our scheme achieves a key rate of 85.3 bps under a 35 dB channel loss. Combined with security against general attacks and accessible technology, our protocol is a promising candidate for practical multiparty quantum communication networks.

AB We use a gradient-based optimization scheme to find single-qubit rotations to be interwoven between time steps of a noisy logical two-qubit entangling gate in order to suppress the effects of arbitrary logical and leakage noise in the two-qubit gate. We show how the sequence fidelity is affected by imperfections in the single-qubit operations, as well as by various relative strengths of the logical and leakage noise. Our approach is completely general and system-independent, allowing for application to any two-qubit system regardless of the experimental implementation details.

TI On-Chip Optical Power Limiter for Quantum Communications
SO ADVANCED QUANTUM TECHNOLOGIES
AB This article presents an on-chip optical power limiter that utilizes the thermo-optical defocusing effect. A pair of input and output waveguides is designed to mimic emitting and receiving antennas. The waveguides are separated by a free-space region filled with poly-methyl-meth-acrylate (PMMA) material, which has a negative thermal-optic coefficient that causes a decrease in refractive index with an increase in temperature. As the power in the input waveguide increases, the refractive index of the free-space region decreases, which in turn increases the radiated beam's divergence angle with respect to input power. The empirical findings demonstrate that the non-linear divergence angle can be written as theta 0+kP${\theta }_0 + kP$, where theta 0 represents the divergence angle of the equivalent Gaussian beam, k is a waveguide-specific constant, and P is the input power. The edge of the receiving waveguide is tapered to adjust the coupling of the divergent beam to the output waveguide. The taper width is optimized to minimize insertion loss. The devices are two orders lengthwise smaller compared to the bulk demonstration, and they exhibit low loss ranging from 0.2 to 10 dB.
   Photonic integrated circuits (PICs), valued for miniaturization, cost-effectiveness, and energy efficiency, are explored for secure communication.

TI Photonic cellular automaton simulation of relativistic quantum fields:
   Observation of Zitterbewegung
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Quantum cellular automaton (QCA) is a model for universal quantum computation and a natural candidate for digital quantum simulation of relativistic quantum fields. Here we introduce the first photonic platform for implementing QCA simulation of a free relativistic Dirac quantum field in 1 + 1 dimension, through a Dirac quantum cellular automaton (DQCA). Encoding the field position degree of freedom in the orbital angular momentum (OAM) of single photons, our state-of-the-art setup experimentally realizes eight steps of a DQCA, with the possibility of having complete control over the input OAM state preparation and the output measurement making use of two spatial light modulators. Therefore, studying the distribution in the OAM space at each step, we were able to reproduce the time evolution of the free Dirac field observing the Zitterbewegung, an oscillatory movement extremely difficult to see in a real-case experimental scenario that is a signature of the interference of particle and antiparticle states. The accordance between the expected and measured Zitterbewegung oscillations certifies the simulator performances, paving the way towards the application of photonic platforms to the simulation of more complex relativistic effects.

TI Quantum versatility in PageRank
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Quantum mechanics empowers the emergence of quantum advantages in various fields, including quantum algorithms. Quantum PageRank is a promising tool for a future quantum internet. Recently, arbitrary phase rotations (APRs) have been introduced in the underlying Szegedy's quantum walk of the quantum PageRank algorithm. In this work we thoroughly study the role APR plays in quantum PageRank. We discover the versatility resulting from quantumness. Specifically, we discover the emergence of a cluster phenomenon in rankings considering the rotation phases, i.e., the existence of similar clusters in the distribution of the rankings and their fidelity with the corresponding classical PageRanks, the ranking distribution variance, the coherence and entanglement of PageRank states, and the power-law parameter in the ranking distributions on a scale-free network concerning the two rotation phases. Furthermore, we propose an alternate quantum PageRank with APR which provides an extra tunnel for the analysis of PageRank. We also study the PageRank on the trackback graph of a scale-free graph for the investigation of network information traffic tracking. We demonstrate the rich cluster diversity formed in our alternate quantum PageRank, which offers a novel perspective on the quantum versatility of PageRank. Our results present the quantum-enabled perspective for PageRanking and shed light on the design and application of practical quantum PageRank algorithms.

TI Transit facility allocation: Hybrid quantum-classical optimization
SO PLOS ONE
AB An essential consideration in urban transit facility planning is service efficiency and accessibility. Previous research has shown that reducing the number of facilities along a route may increase efficiency but decrease accessibility. Striking a balance between these two is a critical consideration in transit planning. Transit facility consolidation is a cost-effective way to improve the quality of service by strategically determining the desirable allocation of a limited number of facilities. This paper develops an optimization framework that integrates Geographical Information systems (GIS), decision-making analysis, and quantum technologies for addressing the problem of facility consolidation. Our proposed framework includes a novel mathematical model that captures non-linear interactions between facilities and surrounding demand nodes, inter-facility competition, ridership demand and spatial coverage. The developed model can harness the power of quantum effects such as superposition and quantum tunnelling and enables transportation planners to utilize the most recent hardware solutions such as quantum and digital annealers, coherent Ising Machines and gate-based universal quantum computers. This study presents a real-world application of the framework to the public transit facility redundancy problem in the British Columbia Vancouver metropolitan area. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework by reducing the number of facilities by 40% while maintaining the same service accessibility. Additionally, we showcase the ability of the proposed mathematical model to take advantage of quantum annealing and classical optimization techniques.

TI Chip-Level GHz Capable Balanced Quantum Homodyne Receivers
SO JOURNAL OF LIGHTWAVE TECHNOLOGY
AB We present a design of balanced homodyne receivers suitable for ultra-low noise quantum applications such as continuous-variable quantum key distribution and quantum random number generation. For best noise and bandwidth performance a die-level low-parasitic photodiode together with a low-noise high-speed transimpedance amplifier are explored together with a planar lightwave circuit splitter chip serving as a photomixer. Bandwidths of 750 MHz and 2.6 GHz were accomplished while maintaining optimum noise performance, as evidenced by very high quantum-to-classical noise ratios of 26.8 and 18.6 dB, respectively. A common-mode rejection ratio of at least 40 dB was achieved for a frequency range of up to 1 GHz. Its application for continuous-variable quantum key distribution was evaluated by means of estimations under a strict untrusted receiver assumption, showing its potential for generating up to 43 Mbit/s secure-key rate over a reach of 10 km, whereas up to 100 Mbit/s could be supported at shorter reaches. Moreover, the high quantum-to-classical clearance values can enable high quality quantum random number generation at Gb/s rates. The multi-purpose operation of the designed balanced receivers for classical communications was examined showing reception sensitivities of -55.8 and -52.6 dBm at 500 Mbit/s and 1 Gbit/s quadrature phase shift keying transmission, respectively, using the 750 MHz receiver. The faster 2.6 GHz receiver enabled 10 Gbit/s duobinary transmission at -14.8 dBm sensitivity.

TI Computational Complexity of Isometric Tensor-Network States
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB We determine the computational power of isometric tensor-network states (isoTNSs), a variational ansatz originally developed to numerically find and compute properties of gapped ground states and topological states in two dimensions. By mapping two-dimensional isoTNSs to (1 + 1)D unitary quantum circuits, we find that the computation of local expectation values in isoTNSs (including those with translation-invariant bulk) is BQP-complete. We then introduce injective isoTNSs, which are those isoTNSs that are the unique ground states of frustration-free Hamiltonians and which are characterized by an injectivity parameter delta is an element of (0, 1/D], where D is the bond dimension of the isoTNS. We show that injectivity necessarily adds depolarizing noise to the circuit at a rate eta = delta 2D2. We show that weakly injective isoTNS (small delta) are still BQP-complete but that there exists an efficient classical algorithm to compute local expectation values in strongly injective isoTNSs (eta >= 0.41). We also show that while weakly injective isoTNSs can support long-range correlations, strongly injective isoTNSs are approximate Markov states with exponentially decaying correlations. Sampling from isoTNSs corresponds to monitored quantum dynamics and we exhibit a family of isoTNSs that undergo a phase transition from a hard regime to an easy phase in which the monitored circuit can be sampled efficiently. Our results can be used to design provable algorithms to contract isoTNSs. Our mapping between ground states of certain frustration-free Hamiltonians to open circuit dynamics in one dimension fewer may be of independent interest.

TI Controlled Surface Modification to Revive Shallow NV- Centers
SO NANO LETTERS
AB Near-surface negatively charged nitrogen vacancy (NV) centers hold excellent promise for nanoscale magnetic imaging and quantum sensing. However, they often experience charge-state instabilities, leading to strongly reduced fluorescence and NV coherence time, which negatively impact magnetic imaging sensitivity. This occurs even more severely at 4 K and ultrahigh vacuum (UHV, p = 2 x 10-10 mbar). We demonstrate that in situ adsorption of H2O on the diamond surface allows the partial recovery of the shallow NV sensors. Combining these with band-bending calculations, we conclude that controlled surface treat-ments are essential for implementing NV-based quantum sensing protocols under cryogenic UHV conditions.

TI Improving the performance of quantum approximate optimization for
   preparing non-trivial quantum states without translational symmetry
SO NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB The variational preparation of complex quantum states using the quantum approximate optimization algorithm (QAOA) is of fundamental interest, and becomes a promising application of quantum computers. Here, we systematically study the performance of QAOA for preparing ground states of target Hamiltonians near the critical points of their quantum phase transitions, and generating Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) states. We reveal that the performance of QAOA is related to the translational invariance of the target Hamiltonian: without the translational symmetry, for instance due to the open boundary condition (OBC) or randomness in the system, the QAOA becomes less efficient. We then propose a generalized QAOA assisted by the parameterized resource Hamiltonian (PRH-QAOA), to achieve a better performance. In addition, based on the PRH-QAOA, we design a low-depth quantum circuit beyond one-dimensional geometry, to generate GHZ states with perfect fidelity. The experimental realization of the proposed scheme for generating GHZ states on Rydberg-dressed atoms is discussed. Our work paves the way for performing QAOA on programmable quantum processors without translational symmetry, especially for recently developed two-dimensional quantum processors with OBC.

TI Machine-learning-inspired quantum control in many-body dynamics
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Achieving precise preparation of quantum many-body states is crucial for the practical implementation of quantum computation and quantum simulation. However, the inherent challenges posed by unavoidable excitations at critical points during quench processes necessitate careful design of control fields. In this work, we introduce a promising and versatile dynamic control neural network tailored to optimize control fields. We address the problem of suppressing defect density and enhancing cat-state fidelity during the passage across the critical point in the quantum Ising model. Our method facilitates seamless transitions between different objective functions by adjusting the optimization strategy. In comparison to gradient-based power-law quench methods, our approach demonstrates significant advantages for both small system sizes and long-term evolutions. We provide a detailed analysis of the specific forms of control fields and summarize common features for experimental implementation. Furthermore, numerical simulations demonstrate the robustness of our proposal against random noise and spin number fluctuations. The optimized defect density and cat-state fidelity exhibit a transition at a critical ratio of the quench duration to the system size, coinciding with the quantum speed limit for quantum evolution.

TI Variational Quantum Classifier for Binary Classification: Real vs
   Synthetic Dataset
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB Nowadays, quantum-enhanced methods have been widely studied to solve machine learning related problems. This article presents the application of a Variational Quantum Classifier (VQC) for binary classification. We utilized three datasets: a synthetic dataset with randomly generated values between 0 and 1, the publicly available University of California Intelligence Machine learning (UCI) sonar dataset consisting of mining data, and a proprietary diabetes dataset related to diabetes with acute diseases and diabetes without acute disease. To deal with the limitation of noisy intermediate-scale quantum systems (NISQ), we used a pre-processing method to enhance the prediction rate when applying the VQC method. The process includes feature selection and state preparation. Quantum state preparation is critical for obtaining a functioning pipeline in a quantum machine learning (QML) model. Amplitude encoding is a state preparation approach that enhances the performance of data encoding and the learning of quantum models. As a result, our proposed methods achieved accuracies of 75%, 71.4%, and 68.73% by using VQC model and in contrast, the amplitude encoding-based VQC achieved 98.40%, 67.3%, and 74.50% accuracies on the synthetic, sonar, and diabetes dataset, respectively.

TI In-Source High-Resolution Spectroscopy Using an Integrated Tunable Raman
   Laser
SO LASER & PHOTONICS REVIEWS
AB Tunable single-frequency lasers are the most prominent tool for high-resolution spectroscopy, allowing for the study and exploitation of the electronic structure of atoms. A significant milestone relies on the demonstration of integrated laser technology for performing such a task. The device presented here is composed of a compact Fabry-Perot monolithic resonator capable of producing tunable and Fourier-limited nanosecond pulses with a MHz-class frequency stability without active cavity stabilization elements. It also has the remarkable capability of exploiting the Raman effect to funnel efficiently the broad spectrum of an input laser to a spectrally-bright Stokes pulse at hard-to-access wavelength ranges. The targeted atom for the demonstrations is 152Sm, released as an atomic vapor in a hot cavity environment. Here, the Stokes field is tuned to a wavelength of 433.9 nm, while a crossed-beams spectroscopy setup is used to minimize the Doppler broadened spectral features of the atoms. With this work, the suitability of integrated diamond Raman lasers as a high-resolution in-source spectroscopy tool is demonstrated, enabling many applications in atomic and nuclear physics. The integrated form-factor and inherent simplicity makes such a laser an interesting prospect for quantum-technology based sensing systems and related applications.
   Integrated diamond Raman lasers can be used for in-source high resolution spectroscopy experiments.

TI Anyon quantum dimensions from an arbitrary ground state wave function
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Realizing topological orders and topological quantum computation is a central task of modern physics. An important but notoriously hard question in this endeavor is how to diagnose topological orders that lack conventional order parameters. A breakthrough in this problem is the discovery of topological entanglement entropy, which can be used to detect nontrivial topological order from a ground state wave function, but is far from enough for fully determining the topological order. In this work, we take a key step further in this direction: We propose a simple entanglement-based protocol for extracting the quantum dimensions of all anyons from a single ground state wave function in two dimensions. The choice of the space manifold and the ground state is arbitrary. This protocol is both validated in the continuum and verified on lattices, and we anticipate it to be realizable in various quantum simulation platforms.
   Topological entanglement entropy has been used to detect topological orders but it cannot distinguish abelian and non-abelian orders. This work potentially solves this problem using a new entanglement-based protocol for characterizing topological phases with anyons from a single ground state wavefunction in 2D.

TI Sampling, rates, and reaction currents through reverse stochastic
   quantization on quantum computers
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB The quest for improved sampling methods to solve statistical mechanics problems of physical and chemical interest has proceeded with renewed efforts since the invention of the Metropolis algorithm, in 1953. In particular, the understanding of thermally activated rare-event processes between long-lived metastable states, such as protein folding, is still elusive. In this case, one needs both the finite-temperature canonical distribution function and the reaction current between the reactant and product states to completely characterize the dynamic. Here we show how to tackle this problem using a quantum computer. We use the connection between a classical stochastic dynamics and the Schrodinger equation, also known as stochastic quantization, to variationally prepare quantum states, allowing us to unbiasedly sample from a Boltzmann distribution Similarly, reaction rate constants can be computed as ground-state energies of suitably transformed operators, following the supersymmetric extension of the formalism. Finally, we propose a hybrid quantum-classical sampling scheme to escape local minima and explore the configuration space in both real-space and spin Hamiltonians. We indicate how to realize the quantum algorithms constructively, without assuming the existence of oracles or quantum walk operators. The quantum advantage concerning the above applications is discussed.

TI Experimental realization of a quantum classification: Bell state
   measurement via machine learning
SO APL MACHINE LEARNING
AB The Bell state is a crucial resource for the realization of quantum information tasks, and when combined with orbital angular momentum (OAM), it enables a high-dimensional Hilbert space, which is essential for high-capacity quantum communication. In this study, we demonstrate the recognition of OAM Bell states using interference patterns generated by a classical light source and a single-photon source from a Sagnac interferometer-based OAM Bell state evolution device. The interference patterns exhibit a one-to-one correspondence with the input Bell states, providing conclusive evidence for the full recognition of OAM Bell states. Furthermore, we introduce machine learning to the field of Bell state recognition by proposing a neural network model capable of accurately recognizing higher order single-photon OAM Bell states, even in the undersampling case. In particular, the model's training set includes interference patterns of OAM Bell states generated by classical light sources, yet it is able to recognize single-photon OAM Bell states with high accuracy, without rel10.1063/5.0175787ying on quantum resources during training. Our innovative application of neural networks to the recognition of single-photon OAM Bell states not only circumvents the resource consumption and experimental difficulties associated with quantum light sources but also facilitates the study of OAM-based quantum information.

TI Q-SupCon: Quantum-Enhanced Supervised Contrastive Learning Architecture
   within the Representation Learning Framework
SO ACM TRANSACTIONS ON QUANTUM COMPUTING
AB In the evolving landscape of data privacy regulations, the challenge of providing extensive data for robust deep classification models arises. The accuracy of these models relies on the amount of training data, due to the multitude of parameters that require tuning. Unfortunately, obtaining such ample data proves challenging, particularly in domains like medical applications, where there is a pressing need for robust models for early disease detection but a shortage of labeled data. Nevertheless, the classical supervised contrastive learning models, have shown the potential to address this challenge up to a certain limit, by utilizing deep encoder models. However, recent advancements in quantum machine learning enable the extraction of meaningful representations from extremely limited and simple data. Thus, replacing classical counterparts in classical or hybrid quantum-classical supervised contrastive models enhances feature learning capability with minimal data. Therefore, this work proposes the Q-SupCon model, a fully quantum-powered supervised contrastive learning model comprising a quantum data augmentation circuit, quantum encoder, quantum projection head, and quantum variational classifier, enabling efficient image classification with minimal labeled data. Furthermore, the novel model attains 80%, 60%, and 80% test accuracy on MNIST, KMNIST, and FMNIST datasets, marking a significant advancement in addressing the data scarcity challenge.

TI Phenomenological theory of variational quantum ground-state preparation
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB The variational approach is a cornerstone of computational physics, considering both conventional and quantum computing computational platforms. The variational quantum eigensolver algorithm aims to prepare the ground state of a Hamiltonian exploiting parametrized quantum circuits that may offer an advantage compared to classical trial states used, for instance, in quantum Monte Carlo or tensor network calculations. While, traditionally, the main focus has been on developing better trial circuits, we show that the algorithm's success, if optimized within stochastic gradient descent (SGD) or quantum natural gradient descent (QNGD), crucially depends on other parameters such as the learning rate, the number Ns of measurements to estimate the gradient components, and the Hamiltonian gap Delta. Within the standard SGD or QNGD, we first observe the existence of a finite Ns value below which the optimization is impossible, and the energy variance resembles the behavior of the specific heat in second-order phase transitions. Second, when Ns is above such threshold level, and learning is possible, we develop a phenomenological model that relates the fidelity of the state preparation with the optimization hyperparameters and Delta. More specifically, we observe that the computational resources scale as 1/Delta 2, and we propose a symmetry enhancement of the variational ansatz as a way to increase the closing gap. We test our understanding on several instances of two-dimensional frustrated quantum magnets, which are believed to be the most promising candidates for near-term quantum advantage through variational quantum simulations.

TI Exploring finite temperature properties of materials with quantum
   computers
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB Thermal properties of nanomaterials are crucial to not only improving our fundamental understanding of condensed matter systems, but also to developing novel materials for applications spanning research and industry. Since quantum effects arise at the nano-scale, these systems are difficult to simulate on classical computers. Quantum computers can efficiently simulate quantum many-body systems, yet current quantum algorithms for calculating thermal properties of these systems incur significant computational costs in that they either prepare the full thermal state on the quantum computer, or they must sample a number of pure states from a distribution that grows with system size. Canonical thermal pure quantum (TPQ) states provide a promising path to estimating thermal properties of quantum materials as they neither require preparation of the full thermal state nor require a growing number of samples with system size. Here, we present an algorithm for preparing canonical TPQ states on quantum computers. We compare three different circuit implementations for the algorithm and demonstrate their capabilities in estimating thermal properties of quantum materials. Due to its increasing accuracy with system size and flexibility in implementation, we anticipate that this method will enable finite temperature explorations of relevant quantum materials on near-term quantum computers.

TI Entangled states dynamics of moving two-level atoms in a thermal field
   bath
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICS A-MATHEMATICAL AND THEORETICAL
AB We consider a two-level atom that follows a wordline of constant velocity, while interacting with a massless scalar field in a thermal state through: (i) an Unruh-DeWitt (UDW) coupling, and (ii) a coupling that involves the time derivative of the field. We treat the atom as an open quantum system, with the field playing the role of the environment, and employ a master equation to describe its time evolution. We study the dynamics of entanglement between the moving atom and a (auxiliary) qubit at rest and isolated from the thermal field. We find that in the case of the standard UDW coupling and for high temperatures of the environment the decay of entanglement is delayed due to the atom's motion. Instead, in the derivative coupling case, the atom's motion always causes the rapid death of entanglement.

TI Non-Markovian Cost Function for Quantum Error Mitigation
SO ADVANCED QUANTUM TECHNOLOGIES
AB In near-term quantum computers like noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices, reducing the impact of errors and decoherence is critical for practical implementation. Existing studies have primarily focused on Markovian noise sources; however, understanding the relationship between quantum error mitigation (QEM) and non-Markovian noise sources is essential, as these effects are practically unavoidable in most solid-state devices used for quantum computing. Here, a non-Markovian model of quantum state evolution and a QEM cost function of controlled-NOT (CNOT) gate operation are presented for NISQ devices interacting with an environment characterized by simple harmonic oscillators as a noise source. Using the projection operator formalism and both advanced and retarded propagators in time, the reduced-density operator is derived for output quantum states in a time-convolutionless form by solving the quantum Liouville equation. Output quantum state fluctuations are analyzed for identity and CNOT gate operations in two-qubit operations across various input states and compare these results with experimental data from ion-trap and superconducting quantum computing systems to estimate the key parameters of the QEM cost functions. These findings demonstrate that the QEM cost function increases as the coupling strength between the quantum system and its environment intensifies. This study highlights the significance of non-Markovian models for understanding quantum state evolution and the practical implications of the QEM cost function in assessing experimental results from NISQ devices.

TI The outcomes of measurements in the de Broglie-Bohm theory
SO COMPTES RENDUS PHYSIQUE
AB Within the de Broglie-Bohm (dBB) theory, the measurement process and the determination of its outcome are usually discussed in terms of the effect of the Bohmian positions of the measured system S. This article shows that the Bohmian positions associated with the measurement apparatus M can actually play a crucial role in the determination of the result of measurement. Indeed, in many cases, the result is practically independent of the initial value of a Bohmian position associated with S, and determined only by those of M. The measurement then does not reveal the value of any pre-existing variable attached to S, but just the initial state of the measurement apparatus. Quantum contextuality then appears with particular clarity as a consequence of the dBB dynamics for entangled systems.

TI Bayesian tomography of high-dimensional on-chip biphoton frequency combs
   with randomized measurements
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Owing in large part to the advent of integrated biphoton frequency combs, recent years have witnessed increased attention to quantum information processing in the frequency domain for its inherent high dimensionality and entanglement compatible with fiber-optic networks. Quantum state tomography of such states, however, has required complex and precise engineering of active frequency mixing operations, which are difficult to scale. To address these limitations, we propose a solution that employs a pulse shaper and electro-optic phase modulator to perform random operations instead of mixing in a prescribed manner. We successfully verify the entanglement and reconstruct the full density matrix of biphoton frequency combs generated from an on-chip Si3N4 microring resonator in up to an 8 x 8-dimensional two-qudit Hilbert space, the highest dimension to date for frequency bins. More generally, our employed Bayesian statistical model can be tailored to a variety of quantum systems with restricted measurement capabilities, forming an opportunistic tomographic framework that utilizes all available data in an optimal way.
   Full tomography of biphoton frequency comb states requires frequency mixing operations which are hard to scale. Here, the authors propose and demonstrate a protocol exploiting advanced Bayesian statistical methods and randomized measurements coming from complex mode mixing in electro-optic phase modulators.

TI Secure and Efficient Two-Party Quantum Scalar Product Protocol With
   Application to Privacy-Preserving Matrix Multiplication
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON CIRCUITS AND SYSTEMS I-REGULAR PAPERS
AB Secure two-party scalar product (S2SP) is a promising research area within secure multiparty computation (SMC), which can solve a range of SMC problems, such as intrusion detection, data analysis, and geometric computations. However, existing quantum S2SP protocols are not efficient enough, and the complexity is usually close to exponential level. In this paper, a novel secure two-party quantum scalar product (S2QSP) protocol based on Fourier entangled states is proposed to achieve higher efficiency. Firstly, the definition of unconditional security under malicious models is given. And then, an honesty verification method called Entanglement Bondage is proposed, which is used in conjunction with the modular summation gate to resist malicious attacks. The property of Fourierentangled states is used to calculate the scalar product with polynomial complexity. The unconditional security of our protocol is proved, which guarantees the privacy of all parties. In addition, we design a privacy-preserving quantum matrix multiplication protocol based on S2QSP protocol. By transforming matrix multiplication into a series of scalar product processes, the product of two private matrices is calculated without revealing any privacy. Finally, we show our protocol's feasibility in IBM Qiskit simulator.

TI An architecture for quantum networking of neutral atom processors
SO APPLIED PHYSICS B-LASERS AND OPTICS
AB Development of a network for remote entanglement of quantum processors is an outstanding challenge in quantum information science. We propose and analyze a two-species architecture for remote entanglement of neutral atom quantum computers based on integration of optically trapped atomic qubit arrays with fast optics for photon collection. One of the atomic species is used for atom-photon entanglement, and the other species provides local processing. We compare the achievable rates of remote entanglement generation for two optical approaches: free space photon collection with a lens and a near-concentric, long working distance resonant cavity. Laser cooling and trapping within the cavity remove the need for mechanical transport of atoms from a source region, which allows for a fast repetition rate. Using optimized values of the cavity finesse, remote entanglement generation rates > 10(3) s(-1) are predicted for experimentally feasible parameters.

TI Photon Pair Source based on PPLN-Waveguides for Entangled Two-Photon
   Absorption
SO ADVANCED PHYSICS RESEARCH
AB Fluorescence excitation by absorption of entangled photon pairs offers benefits compared to classical imaging techniques, such as the attainment of higher signal levels at low excitation power while simultaneously mitigating phototoxicity. However, current entangled photon pair sources are unreliable for fluorescence detection. In order to address this limitation, there is a need for ultra-bright entangled photon pair sources. Among the potential solutions, sources utilizing nonlinear waveguides emerge as promising candidates to facilitate fluorescence excitation through entangled photons. In this paper, a source consisting of a periodically poled lithium niobate waveguide is developed and its key characteristics are analyzed. To demonstrate its suitability as key component for imaging experiments, the entangled two-photon absorption behavior of Cadmium Selenide Zinc Sulfide quantum dot solutions is experimentally investigated.

AB We define a map from an arbitrary quantum circuit to a local Hamiltonian whose ground state encodes the quantum computation. All previous maps relied on the Feynman-Kitaev construction, which introduces an ancillary 'clock register' to track the computational steps. Our construction, on the other hand, relies on injective tensor networks with associated parent Hamiltonians, avoiding the introduction of a clock register. This comes at the cost of the ground state containing only a noisy version of the quantum computation, with independent stochastic noise. We can remedy this - making our construction robust - by using quantum fault tolerance. In addition to the stochastic noise, we show that any state with energy density exponentially small in the circuit depth encodes a noisy version of the quantum computation with adversarial noise. We also show that any 'combinatorial state' with energy density polynomially small in depth encodes the quantum computation with adversarial noise. This serves as evidence that any state with energy density polynomially small in depth has a similar property.
   As an application, we show that contracting injective tensor networks to additive error is BQP-hard. We also discuss the implication of our construction to the quantum PCP conjecture, combining with an observation that QMA verification can be done in logarithmic depth.

TI On-Chip Apodized Hybrid Photonic-Plasmonic Cavity QED for Polarized
   Single Photons Coupling
SO ADVANCED QUANTUM TECHNOLOGIES
AB A system is proposed for the efficient coupling of plasmon-enhanced polarized single photons into a 1D apodized hybrid photonic-plasmonic (HPP) cavity structure, to realize cavity quantum electrodynamics (QED). The HPP cavity is formed by placing a gold nanorod (GNR) on an apodized 1D photonic crystal (PhC) cavity designed on a diamond waveguide. It is shown that the spontaneous emission of quantum emitters (QE) can be strongly enhanced by utilizing the combination of GNR and Phc cavity structure, leading to the emission of highly polarized and bright single photons. The Purcell factor is numerically estimated as high approximate to 5303, with a cavity-enhanced coupling efficiency of up to approximate to 24.3% and a degree of polarization (DOP) of more than 99%, in the guided modes of the HPP cavity. Under the resonance condition, a 28-fold increase in enhancement factor in the HPP cavity as compared to a moderate finesse-based Phc cavity is achieved. The cavity is designed to minimize the losses, resulting in a scattering-limited Q-factor and one-pass loss estimated to be around 21500 and 0.1%, respectively. This work paves the way to realize quantum photonic devices based on efficient photonic interfaces for on-chip quantum information processing applications.

TI Digitized counterdiabatic quantum optimization for bin packing problem
SO EPJ QUANTUM TECHNOLOGY
AB The bin packing problem (BPP), a classical NP-hard combinatorial optimization challenge, has emerged as a promising application for quantum computing. In this work, we tackle the one-dimensional BPP (1dBPP) using a digitized counterdiabatic quantum approximate optimization algorithm (DC-QAOA) that incorporates counterdiabatic (CD) driving to achieve a 40% higher feasibility ratio than standard QAOA, while reducing quantum resource requirements. We investigate three ansatz schemes -DC-QAOA, CD-inspired ansatz, and CD-mixer ansatz - each integrating CD terms with distinct combinations of cost and mixer Hamiltonians, resulting in different DC-QAOA variants. Numerical simulations demonstrate that these DC-QAOA variants maintain solution accuracy with less than 5% variance across varying iteration numbers, circuit depths, and Hamiltonian step sizes. Moreover, they require approximately 7 to 8 times fewer measurements to achieve comparable precision under the same parameter variations. Experimental validation on a 10-item 1dBPP instance using IBM quantum computers shows the CD-mixer ansatz achieves five times more feasibility solutions and greater robustness against NISQ noise. Collectively, these results establish DC-QAOA as a resource-efficient framework for combinatorial optimization on near-term quantum devices.

SO GPS SOLUTIONS
AB Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSSs), such as GPS and Galileo, provide precise time and space coordinates globally and constitute part of the critical infrastructure of modern society. To reliably operate GNSS, a highly accurate and stable system time is required, such as the one provided by several independent clocks hosted in Precise Timing Facilities (PTFs) around the world. The relative clock offset between PTFs is periodically measured to have a fallback system to synchronize the GNSS satellite clocks. The security and integrity of the communication between PTFs is of paramount importance: if compromised, it could lead to disruptions to the GNSS service. Therefore, securing the communication between PTFs is a compelling use-case for protection via Quantum Key Distribution (QKD), since this technology provides information-theoretic security. We have performed a field trial demonstration of such a use-case by sharing encrypted time synchronization information between two PTFs, one located in Oberpfaffenhofen (Germany) and one in Matera (Italy)-more than 900 km apart. To bridge this large distance, a satellite-QKD system is required, plus a "last-mile" terrestrial link to connect the optical ground station (OGS) to the actual location of the PTF. In our demonstration, we have deployed two full QKD systems to protect the last-mile connection at both locations and have shown via simulation that upcoming QKD satellites will be able to distribute keys between Oberpfaffenhofen and Matera, exploiting already existing OGSs.

TI A quantum speedup algorithm for TSP based on quantum dynamic programming
   with very few qubits
SO THEORETICAL COMPUTER SCIENCE
AB The Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) is a classical NP-hard problem that plays a crucial role in combinatorial optimization. In this paper, we are interested in the quantum search framework for the TSP because it has robust theoretical guarantees. However, we need to first search for all Hamiltonian cycles from a very large solution space, which greatly weakens the advantage of quantum search algorithms. To address this issue, one can first prepare a superposition state of all feasible solutions, and then amplify the amplitude of the optimal solution from it. We propose a quantum algorithm to generate the uniform superposition state of all N-length Hamiltonian cycles as an initial state within polynomial gate complexity based on pure quantum dynamic programming with very few ancillary qubits, which achieves exponential acceleration compared to the previous initial state preparation algorithm. As a result, we realized the theoretical minimum query complexity of quantum search algorithms for a general TSP. Compared to some algorithms that theoretically have lower query complexities but lack practical implementation solutions, our algorithm has feasible circuit implementation.

TI Character Randomized Benchmarking for Non-Multiplicity-Free Groups With
   Applications to Subspace, Leakage, and Matchgate Randomized Benchmarking
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB Randomized benchmarking (RB) is a powerful method for determining the error rate of experimental quantum gates. Traditional RB, however, is restricted to gatesets, such as the Clifford group, that form a unitary 2-design. The recently introduced character RB can benchmark more general gates using techniques from representation theory; up to now, however, this method has only been applied to "multiplicity-free" groups, a mathematical restriction on these groups. In this paper, we extend the original character RB derivation to explicitly treat non-multiplicity-free groups, and derive several applications. First, we derive a rigorous version of the recently introduced subspace RB, which seeks to characterize a set of one- and two-qubit gates that are symmetric under SWAP. Second, we develop a new leakage RB protocol that applies to more general groups of gates. Finally, we derive a scalable RB protocol for the matchgate group, a group that like the Clifford group is nonuniversal but becomes universal with the addition of one additional gate. This example provides one of the few examples of a scalable non-Clifford RB protocol. In all three cases, compared to existing theories, our method requires similar resources, but either provides a more accurate estimate of gate fidelity, or applies to a more general group of gates. In conclusion, we discuss the potential, and challenges, of using non-multiplicity-free character RB to develop new classes of scalable RB protocols and methods of characterizing specific gates.

TI Quantum Hybrid Diffusion Models for Image Synthesis
SO KUNSTLICHE INTELLIGENZ
AB In this paper, we propose a new methodology to design quantum hybrid diffusion models, derived from classical U-Nets with ResNet and Attention layers. Specifically, we propose two possible different hybridization schemes combining quantum computing's superior generalization with classical networks' modularity. In the first one, we acted at the vertex: ResNet convolutional layers are gradually replaced with variational circuits to create Quantum ResNet blocks. In the second proposed architecture, we extend the hybridization to the intermediate level of the encoder, due to its higher sensitivity in the feature extraction process. In order to conduct an in-depth analysis of the potential advantages stemming from the integration of quantum layers, images generated by quantum hybrid diffusion models are compared to those generated by classical models, and evaluated in terms of several quantitative metrics. The results demonstrate an advantage in using hybrid quantum diffusion models, as they generally synthesize better-quality images and converges faster. Moreover, they show the additional advantage of having a lower number of parameters to train compared to the classical one, with a reduction that depends on the extent to which the vertex is hybridized.

TI Experimental Speedup of Quantum Dynamics through Squeezing
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB We show experimentally that a broad class of interactions involving quantum harmonic oscillators can be made stronger (amplified) using a unitary squeezing protocol. While our demonstration uses the motional and internal states of a single trapped 25Mg+ ion, the scheme applies generally to Hamiltonians involving just a single harmonic oscillator as well as Hamiltonians coupling the oscillator to another quantum degree of freedom such as a qubit, covering a large range of systems of interest in quantum information and metrology applications. Importantly, the protocol does not require knowledge of the parameters of the Hamiltonian to be amplified, nor does it require a well-defined phase relationship between the squeezing interaction and the rest of the system dynamics, making it potentially useful in instances where certain aspects of a signal or interaction may be unknown or uncontrolled, such as searches for novel forms of dark matter.

TI Understanding and mitigating noise in molecular quantum linear response
   for spectroscopic properties on quantum computers
SO CHEMICAL SCIENCE
AB The promise of quantum computing to circumvent the exponential scaling of quantum chemistry has sparked a race to develop chemistry algorithms for quantum architecture. However, most works neglect the quantum-inherent shot noise, let alone the effect of current noisy devices. Here, we present a comprehensive study of quantum linear response (qLR) theory obtaining spectroscopic properties on simulated fault-tolerant quantum computers and present-day near-term quantum hardware. This work introduces novel metrics to analyze and predict the origins of noise in the quantum algorithm, proposes an Ansatz-based error mitigation technique, and reveals the significant impact of Pauli saving in reducing measurement costs and noise in subspace methods. Our hardware results using up to cc-pVTZ basis set serve as proof of principle for obtaining absorption spectra on quantum hardware in a general approach with the accuracy of classical multi-configurational methods. Importantly, our results exemplify that substantial improvements in hardware error rates and measurement speed are necessary to lift quantum computational chemistry from proof of concept to an actual impact in the field.

TI Quantum-Inspired Control Strategies for Reducing DC-Link Voltage
   Fluctuations in DFIG Wind Energy Converters
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB The integration of renewable energy sources into power grids presents significant technical challenges, particularly regarding voltage stability and power quality. While Doubly-Fed Induction Generators (DFIGs) offer superior performance in variable wind conditions, their DC-link voltage fluctuations remain a critical concern affecting system reliability, component longevity, and grid compliance. This paper presents a quantum-inspired discrete Proportional-Integral (PI) controller to stabilize DC-link voltage in DFIG-based wind energy systems. The approach integrates quantum computing principles into classical control frameworks, creating a hybrid methodology that leverages quantum-inspired optimization while maintaining implementation feasibility on conventional hardware. By incorporating quantum-inspired algorithms into the Grid-Side Converter (GSC) control framework, the strategy dynamically adjusts PI gains using qubit-based probabilistic modeling-where control parameters exist simultaneously in multiple potential states, similar to quantum bits existing in both 0 and 1 states concurrently. This superposition-based optimization explores multiple solution spaces in parallel, achieving 40-50% faster convergence than classical methods. Simulations of a 1.5 MW DFIG system demonstrated a 69.6% reduction in steady-state voltage fluctuations (from 11.97% to 3.64%) and 73.8% improvement during symmetrical faults (from 33.33% to 11.31%), while limiting peak deviations to <10% during unsymmetrical faults (L-L-G/L-G). The controller maintained stable DC-link voltage at 1150V +/- 40V under normal operation and exhibited only 3.5% overshoot during fault conditions, significantly outperforming conventional PI and fuzzy controllers. This quantum-classical hybrid approach reduces mechanical stress on capacitors and converters, extends equipment lifespan, and enables higher renewable integration through improved grid stability while maintaining compliance with IEEE 1547-2018 standards.

TI Quantum AI and hybrid simulators for a Universal Quantum Field
   Computation Model
SO METHODSX
AB Quantum field theory (QFTh) simulators simulate physical systems using quantum circuits that process quantum information (qubits) via single field (SF) and/or quantum double field (QDF) transformation. This review presents models that classify states against pairwise particle states vertical bar ij >, given their state transition (ST) probability P-vertical bar ij >. A quantum AI (QAI) program, weighs and compares the field's distance between entangled states as qubits from their scalar field of radius R >= vertical bar r(ij)vertical bar. These states distribute across < R > with expected probability < P-distribute > and measurement outcome < m(P-distribute)> = P-vertical bar ij >. A quantum-classical hybrid model of processors via QAI, classifies and predicts states by decoding qubits into classical bits. For example, a QDF as a quantum field computation model (QFCM) in IBM-QE, performs the doubling of P-vertical bar ij > for a strong state prediction outcome. QFCMs are compared to achieve a universal QFCM (UQFCM). This model is novel in making strong event predictions by simulating systems on any scale using QAI. Its expected measurement fidelity is < m(F)> >= 7/5 in classifying states to select 7 optimal QFCMs to predict < m >'s on QFTh observables. This includes QFCMs' commonality of < m > against QFCMs limitations in predicting system events. Common measurement results of QFCMs include their expected success probability < P-success > over STs occurring in the system. Consistent results with high F's, are averaged over STs as < P-distribute > yielding < P-success > >= 2/3 performed by an SF or QDF of certain QFCMs. A combination of QFCMs with this fidelity level predicts error rates (uncertainties) in measurements, by which a P-vertical bar ij > = < P-success > less than or similar to 1 is weighted as a QAI output to a QFCM user. The user then decides which QFCMs perform a more efficient system simulation as a reliable solution. A UQFCM is useful in predicting system states by preserving and recovering information for intelligent decision support systems in applied, physical, legal and decision sciences, including industry 4.0 systems.

TI Digital-analog counterdiabatic quantum optimization with trapped ions
SO QUANTUM SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB We introduce a hardware-specific, problem-dependent digital-analog quantum algorithm of a counterdiabatic quantum dynamics tailored for optimization problems. Specifically, we focus on trapped-ion architectures, taking advantage from global M & oslash;lmer-S & oslash;rensen gates as the analog interactions complemented by digital gates, both of which are available in the state-of-the-art technologies. We show an optimal configuration of analog blocks and digital steps leading to a substantial reduction in circuit depth compared to the purely digital approach. This implies that, using the proposed encoding, we can address larger optimization problem instances, requiring more qubits, while preserving the coherence time of current devices. Furthermore, we study the minimum gate fidelity required by the analog blocks to outperform the purely digital simulation, finding that it is below the best fidelity reported in the literature. To validate the performance of the digital-analog encoding, we tackle the maximum independent set problem, showing that it requires fewer resources compared to the digital case. This hybrid co-design approach paves the way towards quantum advantage for efficient solutions of quantum optimization problems.

TI Enhanced power on small scales and evolution of quantum state of
   perturbations in single and two field inflationary models
SO GENERAL RELATIVITY AND GRAVITATION
AB With the detection of gravitational waves from merging binary black holes, over the last few years, there has been a considerable interest in the literature to understand if these black holes could have originated in the early universe. If the primordial scalar power over small scales is boosted considerably when compared to the COBE normalized amplitude over large scales, then, such an increased power can lead to a copious production of primordial black holes that can constitute a significant fraction of the cold dark matter density today. Recently, many models of inflation involving single or two scalar fields have been constructed which lead to enhanced power on small scales. In this work, we examine the evolution of the quantum state of the curvature perturbations in such single and two field models of inflation using measures of squeezing, entanglement entropy or quantum discord. We find that, in the single as well as the two field models, the extent of squeezing of the modes is enhanced to a certain extent (when compared to the scenarios involving only slow roll) over modes which exhibit increased scalar power. Moreover, we show that, in the two field models, the entanglement entropy associated with the curvature perturbation, arrived at when the isocurvature perturbation has been traced out, is also enhanced over the small scales. We also take the opportunity to discuss the relation between entanglement entropy and quantum discord in the case of the two field model. We conclude with a brief discussion on the wider implications of the results.

TI Separation of Out-Of-Time-Ordered Correlation and Entanglement
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB The out-of-time-ordered correlation (OTOC) and entanglement are two physically motivated and widely used probes of the "scrambling" of quantum information, a phenomenon that has drawn great interest recently in quantum gravity and many-body physics. We argue that the corresponding notions of scrambling can be fundamentally different, by proving an asymptotic separation between the time scales of the saturation of OTOC and that of entanglement entropy in a random quantum-circuit model defined on graphs with a tight bottleneck, such as tree graphs. Our result counters the intuition that a random quantum circuit mixes in time proportional to the diameter of the underlying graph of interactions. It also provides a more rigorous justification for an argument in our previous work [Shor P.W., Scrambling time and causal structure of the photon sphere of a Schwarzschild black hole, arXiv:1807.04363 (2018)], that black holes may be slow information scramblers, which in turn relates to the black-hole information problem. The bounds we obtain for OTOC are interesting in their own right in that they generalize previous studies of OTOC on lattices to the geometries on graphs in a rigorous and general fashion.

AB Detecting gravity-mediated entanglement can provide evidence that the gravitational field obeys quantum mechanics. We report the result of a simulation of the phenomenon using a photonic platform. The simulation tests the idea of probing the quantum nature of a variable by using it to mediate entanglement and yields theoretical and experimental insights, clarifying the operational tools needed for future gravitational experiments. We employ three methods to test the presence of entanglement: the Bell test, entanglement witness, and quantum state tomography. We also simulate the alternative scenario predicted by gravitational collapse models or due to imperfections in the experimental setup and use quantum state tomography to certify the absence of entanglement. The simulation reinforces two main lessons: (1) which path information must be first encoded and subsequently coherently erased from the gravitational field and (2) performing a Bell test leads to stronger conclusions, certifying the existence of gravity-mediated nonlocality.

TI A giant atom with modulated transition frequency
SO FRONTIERS OF PHYSICS
AB Giant atoms are known for the frequency-dependent spontaneous emission and associated interference effects. In this paper, we study the spontaneous emission dynamics of a two-level giant atom with dynamically modulated transition frequency. It is shown that the retarded feedback effect of the giant-atom system is greatly modified by a dynamical phase arising from the frequency modulation and the retardation effect itself Interestingly, such a modification can in turn suppress the retarded feedback such that the giant atom behaves like a small one. By introducing an additional phase difference between the two atom-waveguide coupling paths, we also demonstrate the possibility of realizing chiral and tunable temporal profiles of the output fields. The results in this paper have potential applications in quantum information processing and quantum network engineering.

TI Tavis-Cummings Model with Moving Atoms
SO ENTROPY
AB In this work, we examine a nonlinear version of the Tavis-Cummings model for two two-level atoms interacting with a single-mode field within a cavity in the context of power-law potentials. We consider the effect of the particle position that depends on the velocity and acceleration, and the coupling parameter is supposed to be time-dependent. We examine the effect of velocity and acceleration on the dynamical behavior of some quantumness measures, namely as von Neumann entropy, concurrence and Mandel parameter. We have found that the entanglement of subsystem states and the photon statistics are largely dependent on the choice of the qubit motion and power-law exponent. The obtained results present potential applications for quantum information and optics with optimal conditions.

TI Local Binary and Multiclass SVMs Trained on a Quantum Annealer
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON QUANTUM ENGINEERING
AB Support vector machines (SVMs) are widely used machine learning models, with formulations for both classification and regression tasks. In the last years, with the advent of working quantum annealers, hybrid SVM models characterized by quantum training and classical execution have been introduced. These models have demonstrated comparable performance to their classical counterparts. However, they are limited in the training set size due to the restricted connectivity of the current quantum annealers. Hence, to take advantage of large datasets, a strategy is required. In the classical domain, local SVMs, namely, SVMs trained on the data samples selected by a k-nearest neighbors model, have already proven successful. Here, the local application of quantum-trained SVM models is proposed and empirically assessed. In particular, this approach allows overcoming the constraints on the training set size of the quantum-trained models while enhancing their performance. In practice, the fast local kernel support vector machine (FaLK-SVM) method, designed for efficient local SVMs, has been combined with quantum-trained SVM models for binary and multiclass classification. In addition, for comparison, FaLK-SVM has been interfaced for the first time with a classical single-step multiclass SVM model. Concerning the empirical evaluation, D-Wave's quantum annealers and real-world datasets taken from the remote sensing domain have been employed. The results have shown the effectiveness and scalability of the proposed approach, but also its practical applicability in a real-world large-scale scenario.

TI Experimental entanglement characterization of two-rebit states
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB We characterize entanglement subject to its definition over real and complex, composite quantum systems. In particular, a method is established to assess quantum correlations with respect to a selected number system, illuminating the deeply rooted, yet rarely discussed question of why quantum states are described via complex numbers. With our experiment, we then realize two-photon polarization states that are entangled with respect to the notion of two rebits, comprising two two-level systems over real numbers. At the same time, the generated states are separable with respect to two complex qubits. Among other results, we reconstruct the best approximation of the generated states in terms of a real-valued, local expansion and show that this yields an incomplete description of our data. Conversely, the generated states are shown to be fully decomposable in terms of tensor-product states with complex wave functions. Thereby, we probe paradigms of quantum physics with modern theoretical tools and experimental platforms that are relevant for applications in quantum information science and technology and connected to the fundamentals of the quantum description of nature.

TI Compressed-sensing Lindbladian quantum tomography with trapped ions
SO QUANTUM SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB Characterizing the dynamics of quantum systems is a central task for the development of quantum information processors (QIPs). It serves to benchmark different devices, learn about their specific noise, and plan the next hardware upgrades. However, this task is also very challenging, for it requires a large number of measurements and time-consuming classical processing. Moreover, when interested in the time dependence of the noise, there is an additional overhead since the characterization must be performed repeatedly within the time interval of interest. To overcome this limitation while, at the same time, ordering the learned sources of noise by their relevance, we focus on the inference of the dynamical generators of the noisy dynamics using Lindbladian quantum tomography (LQT). We propose two different improvements of LQT that alleviate previous shortcomings. In the weak-noise regime of current QIPs, we manage to linearize the maximum likelihood estimation of LQT, turning the constrained optimization into a convex problem to reduce the classical computation cost and to improve its robustness. Moreover, by introducing compressed sensing techniques, we reduce the number of required measurements without sacrificing accuracy. To illustrate these improvements, we apply our LQT tools to trapped-ion experiments of single- and two-qubit gates, advancing in this way the previous state of the art.

The advantages of the path integral formalism are the knowledge and experience accumulated by classical lattice simulation and manifest Lorentz invariance. In this article, we will discuss quantum computation of lattice gauge theory in the path integral formalism, utilize a quantum sampling algorithm to generate gauge configurations, and demonstrate a benchmark test of Z(2) lattice gauge theory on a four-dimensional hypercube.

TI Hyperbolic matter in electrical circuits with tunable complex phases
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Curved spaces play a fundamental role in many areas of modern physics, from cosmological length scales to subatomic structures related to quantum information and quantum gravity. In tabletop experiments, negatively curved spaces can be simulated with hyperbolic lattices. Here we introduce and experimentally realize hyperbolic matter as a paradigm for topological states through topolectrical circuit networks relying on a complex-phase circuit element. The experiment is based on hyperbolic band theory that we confirm here in an unprecedented numerical survey of finite hyperbolic lattices. We implement hyperbolic graphene as an example of topologically nontrivial hyperbolic matter. Our work sets the stage to realize more complex forms of hyperbolic matter to challenge our established theories of physics in curved space, while the tunable complex-phase element developed here can be a key ingredient for future experimental simulation of various Hamiltonians with topological ground states.

TI Quantum parameter estimation on coherently superposed noisy channels
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB A generic qubit unitary operator affected by quantum noise is duplicated and inserted in a coherently superposed channel, superposing two paths offered to a probe qubit across the noisy unitary, and driven by a control qubit. A characterization is performed of the transformation realized by the superposed channel on the joint state of the probe-control qubit pair. The superposed channel is then specifically analyzed for the fundamental metrological task of phase estimation on the noisy unitary, with the performance assessed by the Fisher information, classical or quantum. A comparison is made with conventional estimation techniques and also with a quantum switched channel with indefinite causal order recently investigated for a similar task of phase estimation. In the analysis here, a first important observation is that the control qubit of the superposed channel, although it never directly interacts with the unitary being estimated, can nevertheless be measured alone for effective estimation, while discarding the probe qubit that interacts with the unitary. This property is also present with the switched channel but is inaccessible with conventional techniques. The optimal measurement of the control qubit here is characterized in general conditions. A second important observation is that the noise plays an essential role in coupling the control qubit to the unitary, and that the control qubit remains operative for phase estimation at very strong noise, even with a fully depolarizing noise, whereas conventional estimation and the switched channel become inoperative in these conditions. The results extend the analysis of the capabilities of coherently controlled channels which represent novel devices exploitable for quantum signal and information processing.

TI A Consistent Approach to Modeling Quantum Observers
SO ENTROPY
AB A number of no-go theorems have shown that Wigner's Friend scenarios combined with various metaphysical assumptions lead to contradictions in any version of quantum theory. We present an alternative constructive approach that only assumes that agents make properly qualified true statements. Quantum observers are modeled rigorously, although simplistically, using quantum circuits. Terminology is suggested to help avoid contradictions. Our methodology is applied to the Frauchiger-Renner paradox and results in statements by all agents that are both true and consistent. Quantum theory evades the no-go theorems because they make an incorrect implicit assumption about how quantum agents behave.

TI Manipulation speed of light and giant phase shifting: a new
   quantum-based model for improving efficiency and security of internet of
   things
SO OPTICAL AND QUANTUM ELECTRONICS
AB The Internet of Things (IoT) is transitioning towards Quantum Computing soon, relying on electromagnetic waves for data transfer within circuits and between IoT devices. This paper introduces a four-level atomic medium controlled by electromagnetic fields to manipulate the speed of light, resulting in subluminal and superluminal information transfer for IoT. Subluminal propagation transmits data at an average rate, while superluminal propagation transfers data faster than conventional methods. The differentiation between these two modes of propagation is determined by the sign of the group index, which is positive for subluminal and negative for superluminal. Our proposed model reports a maximum positive and negative group index of +/- 5000. This modified group velocity to become nu(g) = +/- c/5000 enhances IoT information transferring in quantum-based communication. The group delay time is measured to t(d) = +/- 10 mu s in the medium, which increases the capacity for IoT information storage. The maximum value of normal and anomalous phase shift is reported to Phi = +/- 20000 radians at 60cm lengths of the medium; this effect is used to divide information in sub-set that protect IoT information from different types of attacks and losses.

TI A two-dimensional array of single-hole quantum dots
SO APPLIED PHYSICS LETTERS
AB Quantum dots fabricated using methods compatible with semiconductor manufacturing are promising for quantum information processing. In order to fully utilize the potential of this platform, scaling quantum dot arrays along two dimensions is a key step. Here, we demonstrate a two-dimensional quantum dot array where each quantum dot is tuned to single-charge occupancy, verified by simultaneous measurements using two integrated radio frequency charge sensors. We achieve this by using planar germanium quantum dots with low disorder and a small effective mass, allowing the incorporation of dedicated barrier gates to control the coupling of the quantum dots. We measure the hole charge filling spectrum and show that we can tune single-hole quantum dots from isolated quantum dots to strongly exchange coupled quantum dots. These results motivate the use of planar germanium quantum dots as building blocks for quantum simulation and computation.

TI Comparative Study of Portfolio Optimization Models for Cryptocurrency
   and Stock Markets
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB Since the introduction of Modern Portfolio Theory (MPT) in 1952, its practical applications, associated challenges, and computational efficiency on large and high-frequency datasets, particularly datasets not used to develop and optimize the model, have drawn extensive research interest. This study has examined the performance of various portfolio models that have explored the concept of MPT on U.S. stock and cryptocurrency markets, i.e., discrete Markowitz portfolio selection (DMPS), the optimal dynamic portfolio (ODP), the binary unconstrained ODP (BUODP) with a quantum annealing solver, and the 1/N naive diversification (ND). Their performance is then compared to the indices that measure the performance of corresponding market exchange-traded funds (ETFs) for stock markets. Our findings show that the DMPS and ODP perform better than other models, delivering better returns in a shorter period. Both run significantly faster than the BUODP (with quantum annealing) with computation time of approximately 0.5 seconds for the S&P 400, 500, and 600 markets whereas BUODP takes 30 seconds; they also mitigate risk and outperform ETFs and ND model for the out-of-sample test with diversified portfolios combining NASDAQ stocks and cryptocurrencies. Furthermore, we have analyzed the impact of data with different frequency intervals, i.e., weekly, daily, hourly, and one-minute, on portfolio performance of the stock markets. The results suggest that data collection frequencies do not make differences in portfolio selections and weights. This study contributes to the advancement of portfolio theory, providing insights and practical values, especially in addressing computational efficiency for high-frequency and large-scale datasets and saving computational costs.

TI Quantum neural networks in practice: a comparative study with classical
   models from standard data sets to industrial images
SO QUANTUM MACHINE INTELLIGENCE
AB In this study, we compare the performance of randomized classical and quantum neural networks (NNs) as well as classical and quantum-classical hybrid convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for the task of supervised binary image classification. We keep the employed quantum circuits compatible with near-term quantum devices and use two distinct methodologies: applying randomized NNs on dimensionality-reduced data, and applying CNNs to full image data. We evaluate these approaches on three fully-classical data sets of increasing complexity: an artificial hypercube data set, MNIST handwritten digits and industrial images of practical relevance. Our study's central goal is to shed more light on how quantum and classical models perform for various binary classification tasks and on what defines a good quantum model. To this end, our study involves a correlation analysis between classification accuracy and quantum model hyperparameters, and an analysis on the role of entanglement in quantum models, as well as on the impact of initial training parameters. We find classical and quantum-classical hybrid models achieve statistically-equivalent classification accuracies across most data sets with no approach consistently outperforming the other. Interestingly, we observe that quantum NNs show lower variance with respect to initial training parameters and that the role of entanglement is nuanced. While incorporating entangling gates seems to be generally advantageous, we also observe that their (optimizable) entangling power is not correlated with model performance. We also observe an inverse proportionality between the number of entangling gates and the average gate entangling power. Our study provides an industry perspective on quantum machine learning for practical binary image classification tasks, highlighting both current limitations and potential avenues for further research in quantum circuit design, entanglement utilization, and model transferability across varied applications.

TI Quantum query complexity of symmetric oracle problems
SO QUANTUM
AB We study the query complexity of quantum learning problems in which the oracles form a group G of unitary matrices. In the simplest case, one wishes to identify the oracle, and we find a description of the optimal success probability of a t-query quantum algorithm in terms of group characters. As an application, we show that Omega(n) queries are required to identify a random permutation in S-n. More generally, suppose H is a fixed subgroup of the group G of oracles, and given access to an oracle sampled uniformly from G, we want to learn which coset of H the oracle belongs to. We call this problem coset identification and it generalizes a number of well-known quantum algorithms including the Bernstein-Vazirani problem, the van Dam problem and finite field polynomial interpolation. We provide character-theoretic formulas for the optimal success probability achieved by a t-query algorithm for this problem. One application involves the Heisenberg group and provides a family of problems depending on n which require n + 1 queries classically and only 1 query quantumly.

TI A hybrid hash framework for post quantum secure zero knowledge

SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB The advent of quantum computing poses substantial risks to conventional cryptographic mechanisms, particularly hash-based authentication and zero-knowledge identification (ZKI) protocols, which are susceptible to quantum algorithms such as Grover's and Shor's. This study presents a comprehensive benchmarking framework for evaluating the quantum resistance of cryptographic hash functions through performance metrics (execution time, memory utilization), statistical characteristics (entropy, bit-level randomness, avalanche effect), and security attributes (collision and preimage resistance) across diverse input sizes and edge conditions. A novel hybrid hashing strategy, integrating SHA-512 and BLAKE3 in a defense-in-depth configuration, is introduced to enhance post-quantum resilience. Its efficacy is validated via Grover's algorithm simulations, demonstrating a methodology for evaluating the increased computational workload for quantum search algorithms relative to conventional hash functions. The framework incorporates visualization utilities and structured reporting modules, enabling systematic assessment and practical implementation of quantum-resistant cryptographic solutions within ZKI systems. Findings indicate that while classical hashes such as SHA-256 and SHA-512 exhibit theoretically diminished security in quantum threat scenarios, the proposed hybrid method acts as a practical risk mitigation strategy with acceptable computational overhead, providing a viable pathway for safeguarding authentication systems against quantum-capable adversaries.

TI Quantum differential cryptanalysis based on Bernstein-Vazirani algorithm
SO EPJ QUANTUM TECHNOLOGY
AB Recent research has demonstrated the potential of quantum algorithms to exploit vulnerabilities in various popular constructions, such as certain block ciphers like Feistel, Even-Mansour, and multiple MACs, within the superposition query model. In this study, we delve into the security of block ciphers against quantum threats, particularly investigating their susceptibility to cryptanalysis techniques, notably exploring quantum adaptations of differential cryptanalysis. Initially, we introduce a BV-based quantum algorithm for identifying linear structures with a complexity of O(n)\documentclass[12pt]{minimal} \usepackage{amsmath} \usepackage{wasysym} \usepackage{amsfonts} \usepackage{amssymb} \usepackage{amsbsy} \usepackage{mathrsfs} \usepackage{upgreek} \setlength{\oddsidemargin}{-69pt} \begin{document}$O(n)$\end{document}, where n denotes the number of bits in the function. Subsequently, we illustrate the application of this algorithm in devising quantum differential cryptanalysis techniques, including quantum differential cryptanalysis, quantum small probability differential cryptanalysis, and quantum impossible differential cryptanalysis, demonstrating polynomial acceleration compared to prior approaches. By treating the encryption function as a unified entity, our algorithm circumvents the traditional challenge of extending differential paths in differential cryptanalysis.

TI Quantum game strategy solution for R&D cartel: Reorganizing government
   R&D investment strategy in Korea
SO PLOS ONE
AB This study reevaluates criticism of the Korean government's R&D investment strategy, which was considered an 'R&D cartel' and was cited as a reason for the Korean government's R&D cuts in 2023, through an advanced framework of quantum game theory. By modeling the interaction between the government and researchers as a quantum information strategy game, it redefines the dynamics of R&D investment as a quantum game involving two key players: the R&D manager (Alice) and the research performer (Bob). This quantum game, akin to the Prisoner's Dilemma but focused on responsibility and sincerity, allows for the exploration of strategic complexities and decision-making dynamics not possible in classical models. It introduces quantum entanglement and superposition as innovative strategies to shift the paradigm of R&D investment, suggesting that terms like 'R&D bureaucracy' and 'R&D monopoly' more accurately describe the moral hazards in this sector than 'R&D cartel'. Through simulations, the paper demonstrates how quantum strategies can significantly alter outcomes, providing fresh insights and policy alternatives for R&D innovation. This research not only challenges conventional investment frameworks but also proposes a novel approach for achieving Pareto optimal outcomes in government R&D investments, emphasizing the transformative potential of quantum game theory in strategic decision-making and policy development.

AB The Quantum Alternating Operator Ansatz (QAOA) is a prominent variational quantum algorithm for solving combinatorial optimization problems. Its effectiveness depends on identifying input parameters that yield high-quality solutions. However, understanding the complexity of training QAOA remains an under-explored area. Previous results have given analytical performance guarantees for a small, fixed number of parameters. At the opposite end of the spectrum, barren plateaus are likely to emerge at Omega(n) parameters for n qubits. In this work, we study the difficulty of training in the intermediate regime, which is the focus of most current numerical studies and near-term hardware implementations. Through extensive numerical analysis of the quality and quantity of local minima, we argue that QAOA landscapes can exhibit a superpolynomial growth in the number of low-quality local minima even when the number of parameters scales logarithmically with n. This means that the common technique of gradient descent from randomly initialized parameters is doomed to fail beyond small n, and emphasizes the need for good initial guesses of the optimal parameters.

TI Local Purity Distillation in Quantum Systems: Exploring the
   Complementarity Between Purity and Entanglement
SO QUANTUM
AB Quantum thermodynamics and quantum entanglement represent two pivotal quantum resource theories with significant relevance in quantum information science. Despite their importance, the intricate relationship between these two theories is still not fully understood. Here, we investigate the interplay between entanglement and thermodynamics, particularly in the context of local cooling processes. We introduce and develop the framework of Gibbs-preserving local operations and classical communication. Within this framework, we explore strategies enabling remote parties to effectively cool their local systems to the ground state. Our analysis is centered on scenarios where only a single copy of a quantum state is accessible, with the ideal performance defined by the highest possible fidelity to the ground state achievable under these constraints. We focus on systems with fully degenerate local Hamiltonians, where local cooling aligns with the extraction of local purity. In this context, we establish a powerful link between the efficiency of local purity extraction and the degree of entanglement present in the system, a concept we define as purity-entanglement complementarity. Moreover, we demonstrate that in many pertinent scenarios, the optimal performance can be precisely determined through semidefinite programming techniques. Our findings open doors to various practical applications, including techniques for entanglement detection and estimation. We demonstrate this by evaluating the amount of entanglement for a class of bound entangled states.

TI Experimental observation of quantum nonlocality in general networks with
   different topologies
SO FUNDAMENTAL RESEARCH
AB Nonlocal correlation plays an important role in device independent quantum information processing. The stan-dard Bell nonlocality has been well studied with single local hidden variables, however the nonlocal correlations in general networks with several independent quantum sources and distant observers have been far less explored. Here, by using three independent entangled photon sources and recently constructed nonlinear Bell inequalities, we experimentally test the nonlocal correlations in the network scenario with different topologies. The violation of the inequalities can be obtained simply with separate measurements, which is much more favourable from the practical point of view. Our experiment results show a violation as 0 . 7779 ?? 0 . 0093 for the star network, and 0 . 7303 ?? 0 . 0024 for the chain network. Furthermore, we demonstrate that more measurement settings for each observer can bound more information against an eavesdropper.

TI Cryogenic characterization and modeling of a CMOS floating-gate device
   for quantum control hardware
SO SOLID-STATE ELECTRONICS
AB We perform the characterization and modeling of a floating-gate device realized with a commercial 350-nm CMOS technology at cryogenic temperature. The programmability of the device offers a solution in the realization of a precise and flexible cryogenic system for qubits control in large-scale quantum computers. The device stores onto a floating-gate node a non-volatile charge, which can be bidirectionally modified by Fowler-Nordheim tunneling and impact-ionized hot-electron injection. These two injection mechanisms are characterized and modelled in compact equations both at 300 K and 15 K. At cryogenic temperature, we show a fine-tuning of the stored charge compatible with the operation of a precise analog memory. Moreover, we developed accurate simulation models of the proposed floating-gate device that set the stage for designing a programmable analog circuit with better performances and accuracy at a few Kelvin. This work offers a solution in the design of configurable analog electronics to be employed for accurately read out the qubit state at deep-cryogenic temperature.

TI Reducing Quantum Cost for Reversible Realization of
   Densely-packed-decimal Converters
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING
AB At present, the reduction of circuit design power is a prime research topic. The reversible computation satisfies the criteria of the power consumption reduction compared to the traditional logic design. Thereby, reversible computation is gaining much attention in recent decades. Two reversible design approaches of binary-coded-decimal (BCD) to densely-packed-decimal (DPD) converter (encoder) and two design approaches of DPD to BCD converter (decoder) are proposed in this paper. The designs are carried out through the appropriate selection of the gates and further proper organization of such gates with parallel implementation. The proposed design approaches offer a low quantum cost implementation compared to state-of-the-art design. The cost results analysis of reversible DPD encoder shows appreciable reduction by at least similar to 23%, and that of decoder by at least similar to 62% compared to the state-of-art design found in the literature. Furthermore, the structures are decomposed into the primitive-quantum-gates and compressed in compact form for delay calculation.

TI Emergence and Dynamical Stability of a Charge Time-Crystal in a
   Current-Carrying Quantum Dot Simulator
SO NANO LETTERS
AB Periodically driven open quantum systems that never thermalize exhibit a discrete time-crystal behavior, a nonequilibrium quantum phenomenon that has shown promise in quantum information processing applications. Measurements of time-crystallinity are currently limited to (magneto-) optical experiments in atom-cavity systems and spin-systems making it an indirect measurement. We theoretically show that time-crystallinity can be measured directly in the charge-current from a spin-less Hubbard ladder, which can be simulated on a quantum-dot array. We demonstrate that one can dynamically tune the system out and then back on a time-crystal phase, proving its robustness against external forcings. These findings motivate further theoretical and experimental efforts to simulate the time-crystal phenomena in current-carrying nanoscale systems.

TI Entanglement of Spin-Pair Qubits with Intrinsic Dephasing Times
   Exceeding a Minute
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW X
AB Understanding and protecting the coherence of individual quantum systems is a central challenge in quantum science and technology. Over the past decades, a rich variety of methods to extend coherence have been developed. A complementary approach is to look for naturally occurring systems that are inherently protected against decoherence. Here, we show that pairs of identical nuclear spins in solids form intrinsically long-lived qubits. We study three carbon-13 pairs in diamond and realize high-fidelity measurements of their quantum states using a single nitrogen-vacancy center in their vicinity. We then reveal that the spin pairs are robust to external perturbations due to a combination of three phenomena: a decoherence-free subspace, a clock transition, and a variant on motional narrowing. The resulting inhomogeneous dephasing time is T-2* = 1.9(3) min, the longest reported for individually controlled qubits. Finally, we develop complete control and realize an entangled state between two spin pairs through projective parity measurements. These long-lived qubits are abundantly present in diamond and other solids and provide new opportunities for ancilla-enhanced quantum sensing and for robust memory qubits for quantum networks.

TI Global-local duality of energetic control cost in multipartite quantum
   correlated systems
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Multipartite quantum correlated systems (MQCSs) are widely utilized in diverse quantum information tasks, where their sophisticated control inherently incurs energetic costs. However, the fundamental characteristics of these control costs remain elusive, largely due to the lack of thermodynamic descriptions capable of capturing the full complexities of MQCSs. Here, we uncover universal thermodynamic relations for arbitrary MQCSs weakly coupled to a thermal bath, establishing an intrinsic global-local duality of control costs. Using these relations, we elucidate the exact role of multipartite correlation-a defining quantum feature of MQCSs-in shaping control costs at finite times. We also demonstrate that the relative magnitude between global and local control costs is undetermined, which perplexes the cost management of MQCSs under finite-time controls. Our results are numerically corroborated with applications to experimentally realizable multiqubit systems undergoing finitetime qubit reset processes.

TI Preparing Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger states on ground levels of neutral
   atoms
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB We propose a scalable protocol in the Rydberg atomic system to generate the Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) states, where the qubits are encoded on the hyperfine ground levels. Our system is featured with off-resonant driving fields rather than strong Rydberg interaction sufficient for blockade. Closely it can follow the desired nonadiabatic passage during the time evolution and avoid the unwanted transition by imposing the passage-dependent and fast-varying global phase, that serves as an error correction to the universal quantum control. In our protocol, an N-qubit GHZ state is prepared in N - 1 steps, which is found to be robust against both environmental noise and systematic deviation. Our protocol therefore provides an avenue toward large-scale entanglement, which is essential for quantum information processing and computation based on neutral atoms.

TI Realization of Tunable Highly-Efficient Quantum Routing in Chiral
   Waveguides
SO FRONTIERS IN PHYSICS
AB The chiral interaction between single photons in waveguides and quantum emitters has gained considerable attention. Here, we proposed a tunable quantum routing scheme with a chiral quantum system by coupling an emitter to two chiral waveguides. Conventional quantum routers can only be achieved with each port output probability no larger than 25%. But our scheme can transfer quantum information arbitrarily from an input port to another, and each port's output probability is 100%. Besides, we investigated the influence of the Purcell factor in quantum routing properties. No matter how to change the size of the directionalities S-j or set a specific value to the dissipation of the emitter, we always found that the quantum routing has very high efficiency. Moreover, we also used a superconducting qubit coupled to two resonators to show the present scheme is pretty feasible for experimental implementation.

TI Superradiantlike dynamics of nuclear spins by nonadiabatic electron
   shuttling
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
AB We investigate superradiantlike dynamics of a nuclear-spin bath in contact with an electron shuttle, modeled as a moving quantum dot trapping a single electron. The dot is shuttled between two external reservoirs, where electron-nuclear flip flops are associated with tunneling events. For an ideal model with uniform hyperfine interaction, realized through an isotopically enriched "nuclear-spin island", we discuss in detail the nuclear spin evolution and its relation to superradiance. We then show that the superradiantlike evolution is robust to various extensions of the initial setup, and derive the minimum shuttling time which allows to escape adiabatic spin evolution. We also discuss slow/fast shuttling under the inhomogeneous field of a nearby micromagnet and compare our scheme to a model with stationary quantum dot. Finally, we describe the electrical detection of nuclear entanglement in the framework of Monte Carlo wave-function simulations.
