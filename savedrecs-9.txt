TI Cryogenic optical-to-microwave conversion using Si photonic integrated
   circuit Ge photodiodes
SO APL PHOTONICS
AB Integrated circuit technology enables the scaling of circuit complexity and functionality while maintaining manufacturability and reliability. Integration is expected to play an important role in quantum information technologies, including in the highly demanding task of producing the classical signals to control and measure quantum circuits at scales needed for fault-tolerant quantum computation. Here, we experimentally characterize the cryogenic performance of a miniaturized photonic integrated circuit fabricated by a commercial foundry that downconverts classical optical signals into microwave signals. The circuit consists of waveguide-integrated germanium PIN photodiodes packaged using a scalable photonic wire bonding approach to a multi-channel optical fiber array that provides the optical excitation. We find the peak optical-to-microwave conversion response to be similar to 150 +/- 13 mA/W in the O-band at 4.2 K, well below the temperature the circuit was designed for and tested at in the past, for two different diode designs. The second diode design operates to over 6 GHz of 3 dB bandwidth, making it suitable for controlling quantum circuits, with improvements in bandwidth and response expected from improved packaging. The demonstrated miniaturization and integration offers new perspectives for wavelength-division multiplexed control of microwave quantum circuits and scalable processors using light delivered by optical fiber arrays.

TI New constructions of entanglement-assisted quantum codes

AB We present two new constructions of entanglement-assisted quantum error-correcting codes using some fundamental properties of (classical) linear codes in an effective way. The main ideas include linear complementary dual codes and related concatenation constructions. Numerical examples in modest lengths show that our constructions perform better than known constructions in the literature. We also give a proof on a generalization of binary Singleton type bound on entanglement-assisted quantum error-correcting codes to arbitrary q-ary entanglement-assisted quantum error-correcting codes.

TI Resource-theoretic efficacy of the single copy of a two-qubit entangled
   state in a sequential network
SO QUANTUM INFORMATION PROCESSING
AB How best one can recycle a given quantum resource, mitigating the various difficulties involved in its preparation and preservation, is of considerable importance for ensuring efficient applications in quantum technology. Here, we demonstrate quantitatively the resource-theoretic advantage of reusing a single copy of a two-qubit entangled state toward information processing. To this end, we consider a scenario of sequential entanglement detection of a given two-qubit state by multiple independent observers on each of the two spatially separated wings. In particular, we consider equal numbers of sequential observers on the two wings. We first determine the upper bound on the number of observers who can detect entanglement employing suitable entanglement witness operators. In terms of the parameters characterizing the entanglement consumed and the robustness of measurements, we then compare the above scenario with the corresponding scenario involving multiple pairs of entangled qubits shared among the two wings. This reveals a clear resource-theoretic advantage of recycling a single copy of a two-qubit entangled state in the sequential network.

TI Experimental symmetric private information retrieval with
   measurement-device-independent quantum network
SO LIGHT-SCIENCE & APPLICATIONS
AB Secure information retrieval is an essential task in today's highly digitised society. In some applications, it may be necessary that user query's privacy and database content's security are enforced. For these settings, symmetric private information retrieval (SPIR) could be employed, but its implementation is known to be demanding, requiring a private key-exchange network as the base layer. Here, we report for the first time a realisation of provably-secure SPIR supported by a quantum-secure key-exchange network. The SPIR scheme looks at biometric security, offering secure retrieval of 582-byte fingerprint files from a database with 800 entries. Our experimental results clearly demonstrate the feasibility of SPIR with quantum secure communications, thereby opening up new possibilities in secure distributed data storage and cloud computing over the future Quantum Internet.

TI Many-Qudit Representation for the Travelling Salesman Problem
   Optimisation
SO JOURNAL OF THE PHYSICAL SOCIETY OF JAPAN
AB We present a map from the travelling salesman problem (TSP), a prototypical NP-complete combinatorial optimisation task, to the ground state associated with a system of many-qudits. Conventionally, the TSP is cast into a quadratic unconstrained binary optimisation (QUBO) problem that can be solved on an Ising machine. The corresponding physical system's Hilbert space size is 2N2, where N is the number of cities considered in the TSP. Our proposal provides a many-qudit system with a Hilbert space of dimension 2N log2 N, which is considerably smaller than the dimension of the Hilbert space of the system resulting from the usual QUBO map. This reduction can yield a significant speedup in quantum and classical computers. We simulate and validate our proposal using variational Monte Carlo with a neural quantum state, solving the TSP in a linear layout for up to almost 100 cities.

TI Quantum-enhanced Markov chain Monte Carlo for systems larger than a
   quantum computer
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Quantum computers theoretically promise computational advantages in many tasks, but it is much less clear how such advantages can be maintained when using existing and near-term hardware that has limitations in the number and quality of its qubits. Layden et al. [Nature (London) 619, 282 (2023)] proposed a promising application by introducing a quantum-enhanced Markov chain Monte Carlo (QeMCMC) approach to reduce the thermalization time required when sampling from hard probability distributions. In QeMCMC, the size of the required quantum computer scales linearly with the problem, placing limitations on the sizes of systems that can be considered. In this paper we introduce a framework to coarse grain the algorithm in such a way that the quantum computation can be performed using considerably smaller quantum computers and we term the method the coarse grained quantum-enhanced Markov chain Monte Carlo (CGQeMCMC). Example strategies within this framework are put to the test, with the quantum speedup persisting while using only root n simulated qubits where n is the number of qubits required in the original QeMCMC-a quadratic reduction in resources. The coarse graining framework has the potential to be practically applicable in the near term as it requires very few qubits to approach classically intractable problem instances; in this case, only six simulated qubits suffice to gain an advantage compared with standard classical approaches when investigating the magnetization of a 36-spin system. Our method can be easily combined with other classical and quantum techniques and is adaptable to various quantum hardware specifications-in particular those with limited connectivity.

TI Quantum entanglement autodistillation in baryon pair decays
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW D
AB We study the spin-entangled mixed state of a spin-1=2 baryon-antibaryon pair produced in the process e+e- -* J=psi, psi 0 -* BB<overline>. We show that the spin entanglement of the system can increase following the decays B -* i + M and B<overline> -* i<overline> + M<overline>, where i, i<overline> are spin-1=2 baryons and M, M<overline> are spin-0 mesons. This phenomenon, known as entanglement autodistillation, manifests as a probabilistic amplification of entanglement during the decay process. We analyze the underlying mechanism and show that this phenomenon depends only on the initial state of the BB<overline> system and the decay parameter alpha D, but not on the decay parameter phi D. This effect only arises when parity is violated in the decay, when alpha D not equal 0.

TI Twist: Sound Reasoning for Purity and Entanglement in Quantum Programs
SO PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACM ON PROGRAMMING LANGUAGES-PACMPL
AB Quantum programming languages enable developers to implement algorithms for quantum computers that promise computational breakthroughs in classically intractable tasks. Programming quantum computers requires awareness of entanglement, the phenomenon in which measurement outcomes of qubits are correlated. Entanglement can determine the correctness of algorithms and suitability of programming patterns.
   In this work, we formalize purity as a central tool for automating reasoning about entanglement in quantum programs. A pure expression is one whose evaluation is unaffected by the measurement outcomes of qubits that it does not own, implying freedom from entanglement with any other expression in the computation.
   We present Twist, the first language that features a type system for sound reasoning about purity. The type system enables the developer to identify pure expressions using type annotations. Twist also features purity assertion operators that state the absence of entanglement in the output of quantum gates. To soundly check these assertions, Twist uses a combination of static analysis and runtime verification.
   We evaluate Twist's type system and analyses on a benchmark suite of quantum programs in simulation, demonstrating that Twist can express quantum algorithms, catch programming errors in them, and support programs that existing languages disallow, while incurring runtime verification overhead of less than 3.5%.

TI Quantum circuit-based proxy blind signatures: A novel approach and
   experimental evaluation on the IBM quantum cloud platform
SO CHINESE PHYSICS B
AB This paper presents a novel approach to proxy blind signatures in the realm of quantum circuits, aiming to enhance security while safeguarding sensitive information. The main objective of this research is to introduce a quantum proxy blind signature (QPBS) protocol that utilizes quantum logical gates and quantum measurement techniques. The QPBS protocol is constructed by the initial phase, proximal blinding message phase, remote authorization and signature phase, remote validation, and de-blinding phase. This innovative design ensures a secure mechanism for signing documents without revealing the content to the proxy signer, providing practical security authentication in a quantum environment under the assumption that the CNOT gates are securely implemented. Unlike existing approaches, our proposed QPBS protocol eliminates the need for quantum entanglement preparation, thus simplifying the implementation process. To assess the effectiveness and robustness of the QPBS protocol, we conduct comprehensive simulation studies in both ideal and noisy quantum environments on the IBM quantum cloud platform. The results demonstrate the superior performance of the QPBS algorithm, highlighting its resilience against repudiation and forgeability, which are key security concerns in the realm of proxy blind signatures. Furthermore, we have established authentic security thresholds (82.102%) in the presence of real noise, thereby emphasizing the practicality of our proposed solution.

TI Entanglement diagnostics for efficient VQA optimization
SO JOURNAL OF STATISTICAL MECHANICS-THEORY AND EXPERIMENT
AB We consider information spreading measures in randomly initialized variational quantum circuits and introduce entanglement diagnostics for efficient variational quantum/classical computations. We establish a robust connection between entanglement measures and optimization accuracy by solving two eigensolver problems for Ising Hamiltonians with nearest-neighbor and long-range spin interactions. As the circuit depth affects the average entanglement of random circuit states, the entanglement diagnostics can identify a high-performing depth range for optimization tasks encoded in local Hamiltonians. We argue, based on an eigensolver problem for the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev model, that entanglement alone is insufficient as a diagnostic to the approximation of volume-law entangled target states and that a large number of circuit parameters is needed for such an optimization task.

TI QLBM-A quantum lattice Boltzmann software framework
SO COMPUTER PHYSICS COMMUNICATIONS
AB We present QLBM, a Python software package designed to facilitate the development, simulation, and analysis of Quantum Lattice Boltzmann Methods (QBMs). QLBM is a modular framework that introduces a quantum component abstraction hierarchy tailored to the implementation of novel QBMs. The framework interfaces with state-of-the-art quantum software infrastructure to enable efficient simulation and validation pipelines, and leverages novel execution and pre-processing techniques that significantly reduce the computational resources required to develop quantum circuits. We demonstrate the versatility of the software by showcasing multiple QBMs in 2D and 3D with complex boundary conditions, integrated within automated benchmarking utilities. Accompanying the source code are extensive test suites, thorough online documentation resources, analysis tools, visualization methods, and demos that aim to increase the accessibility of QBMs while encouraging reproducibility and collaboration. Program summary Program Title: QLBM CPC Library link to program files: https://doi.org/10.17632/28hkvsg7p2.1 Developer's repository link: https://github.com/QCFD-Lab/qlbm Licensing provisions: MPL-2.0 Programming language: Python3 Supplementary material: The documentation of is available at https://qcfd-lab.github.io/qlbm/. Nature of problem: The advent of quantum algorithms for computational fluid dynamics brings with it challenges that are new to the established field of computational physics. These challenges include the lack of standardized implementations of the still nascent quantum methods, the intense computational demands of developing and simulating quantum algorithms on hardware available today, and the absence of tools that integrate novel developments into established infrastructure. Because of these current limitations, physicists and mathematicians expend superfluous resources on tasks that more mature computational physics branches have surmounted long ago. Solution method: QLBM is a software package that provides an end-to-end development environment for quantum lattice Boltzmann methods. The modular design and flexible quantum circuit library provide a base for extending and generalizing quantum algorithms. Performance enhancements exploit the paradigm of quantum computing simulations to accelerate the speed at which researchers can verify the validity of their methods. Its integration with state-of-the-art quantum computing software and visualization tools increases the algorithms' accessibility. These features allow QLBM to effectively generate, simulate, and analyze quantum circuits for 2D and 3D computational fluid dynamics problems.

   computation
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Generating ground states of any local Hamiltonians seems to be impossible in quantum polynomial time. In this paper, we give evidence for the impossibility by applying an argument used in the quantum-computational-supremacy approach. More precisely, we show that if ground states of any 3-local Hamiltonians can be approximately generated in quantum polynomial time with postselection, then PP = PSPACE. Our result is superior to the existing findings in the sense that we reduce the impossibility to an unlikely relation between classical complexity classes. We also discuss what makes efficiently generating the ground states hard for postselected quantum computation.

AB Context: The rules of Quantum Mechanics have been exploited through Quantum Computing (QC) to solve specific problems and process information in expeditious ways as compared to Conventional Computing (CC) such as factoring integers. Problem: With the alluring computation capability of QC, it is still important to assess the implications and limitations of QC in solving a variety of computationally demanding problems. Method: In this regard, an empirical study was conducted to assess the efficacy of QC in terms of solving certain complex problems by keeping a tradeoff between the execution time and problem size. An analysis was performed based on the widely used Shor's algorithms and the efficacy of QC as compared to CC was reported. Results: The outcomes show that QC has the potential to exponentially speed up the identification of a solution to certain polynomial problems that are intractable for CC. However, further research is needed to fully understand the potential and limitations of QC for Non-Polynomial (NP) complete problems.

TI Towards a Lithium Niobate Photonic Integrated Circuit for Quantum

SO PHOTONICS
AB Quantum transducers are key components for hybrid quantum networks, enabling the transfer of quantum states between microwave and optical photons. In the quantum community, many efforts have focused on creating and verifying the entanglement between microwave and optical fields in systems that typically operate at temperatures in the millikelvin range. Our goal is to develop an integrated microwave optical entanglement device based on a lithium niobate whispering gallery mode resonator (WGMR). To investigate the feasibility of developing such an integrated device, first, a passive photonic integrated circuit (PIC) was designed, fabricated, and characterized. The PIC was developed on a thin-film lithium niobate (TFLN) on an insulator platform, and it includes eight ring resonators and four asymmetric Mach-Zehnder interferometers. This paper presents the design and operational principles of the integrated device for microwave-optical entanglement, as well as the results of the characterization of the passive PIC.

AB To support the execution of multiple simultaneously-running quantum network applications, a quantum network must efficiently allocate shared resources. We study traffic models for a type of quantum network hub called an Entanglement Generation Switch (EGS), a device that allocates resources to enable entanglement generation between nodes in response to user-generated demand. We propose an on-demand resource allocation algorithm, where a demand is either blocked if no resources are available or else results in immediate resource allocation. We model the EGS as an Erlang loss system, with demands corresponding to sessions whose arrival is modelled as a Poisson process. To reflect the operation of a practical quantum switch, our model captures scenarios where a resource is allocated for batches of entanglement generation attempts, possibly interleaved with calibration periods for the quantum network nodes. Calibration periods are necessary to correct against drifts or jumps in the physical parameters of a quantum node. We then derive a formula for the demand blocking probability under three different traffic scenarios using analytical methods from applied probability and queueing theory. We prove an insensitivity theorem which guarantees that the probability a demand is blocked only depends upon the mean duration of each entanglement generation attempt and calibration period, and is not sensitive to their underlying distributions. Our numerical results support our analysis. Our work is the first analysis of traffic characteristics at an EGS system and provides a valuable analytic tool for devising performance driven resource allocation algorithms.

SO RESULTS IN PHYSICS
AB Thermal entanglement and teleportation properties in non-inertial frames are investigated when a two-qubit Heisenberg XXX model with Dzyaloshinski-Moriya (DM) interaction is used as the quantum channel. We find that thermal entanglement and teleportation fidelity decrease with the acceleration parameter or temperature, in other words, the entanglement teleportation of a teleported state will degenerate in non-inertial frames. Furthermore, our results also show that the average fidelity may be promoted by DM interaction for the ferromagnetic case, which is opposite to the antiferromagnetic case in non-inertial frames, although diminished by acceleration parameter, and their influence can be counteracted.

TI Gravitational wave matched filtering by quantum Monte Carlo integration
   and quantum amplitude amplification
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB The speedup of heavy numerical tasks by quantum computing is now actively investigated in various fields including data analysis in physics and astronomy. In this paper, we propose a quantum algorithm for matched filtering in gravitational wave (GW) data analysis based on the previous work by Gao et al. [Phys. Rev. Research 4, 023006 (2022)]. Our approach uses the quantum algorithm for Monte Carlo integration for the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) calculation instead of the fast Fourier transform used in Gao et al. and searches signal templates with high SNR by quantum amplitude amplification. In this way, we achieve an exponential reduction of the qubit number compared with Gao et al.'s algorithm, keeping a quadratic speedup over classical GW matched filtering with respect to the template number.

TI Quantum Quantile Mechanics: Solving Stochastic Differential Equations
   for Generating Time-Series
SO ADVANCED QUANTUM TECHNOLOGIES
AB A quantum algorithm is proposed for sampling from a solution of stochastic differential equations (SDEs). Using differentiable quantum circuits (DQCs) with a feature map encoding of latent variables, the quantile function is represented for an underlying probability distribution and samples extracted as DQC expectation values. Using quantile mechanics the system is propagated in time, thereby allowing for time-series generation. The method is tested by simulating the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process and sampling at times different from the initial point, as required in financial analysis and dataset augmentation. Additionally, continuous quantum generative adversarial networks (qGANs) are analyzed, and the authors show that they represent quantile functions with a modified (reordered) shape that impedes their efficient time-propagation. The results shed light on the connection between quantum quantile mechanics (QQM) and qGANs for SDE-based distributions, and point the importance of differential constraints for model training, analogously with the recent success of physics informed neural networks.

TI Symmetry breaking/symmetry preserving circuits and symmetry restoration
   on quantum computers A quantum many-body perspective
SO EUROPEAN PHYSICAL JOURNAL A
AB We discuss here some aspects related to the symmetries of a quantum many-body problem when trying to treat it on a quantum computer. Several features related to symmetry conservation, symmetry breaking, and possible symmetry restoration are reviewed. After briefly discussing some of the standard symmetries relevant for many-particle systems, we discuss the advantage of encoding some symmetries directly in quantum ansatze, especially to reduce the quantum register size. It is, however, well-known that the use of symmetry-breaking states can also be a unique way to incorporate specific internal correlations when a spontaneous symmetry breaking occurs. These aspects are discussed in the quantum computing context. Ultimately, an accurate description of quantum systems can be achieved only when the initially broken symmetries are properly restored. We review several methods explored previously to perform symmetry restoration on a quantum computer, for instance, the ones based on symmetry filtering by quantum phase estimation and by an iterative independent set of Hadamard tests. We propose novel methods that pave the new directions to perform symmetry restoration, like those based on the purification of the state employing the linear combination of unitaries (LCU) approach.

TI Simulation of adiabatic quantum computing for molecular ground states
SO JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL PHYSICS
AB Quantum computation promises to provide substantial speedups in many practical applications with a particularly exciting one being the simulation of quantum many-body systems. Adiabatic state preparation (ASP) is one way that quantum computers could recreate and simulate the ground state of a physical system. In this paper, we explore a novel approach for classically simulating the time dynamics of ASP with high accuracy and with only modest computational resources via an adaptive sampling configuration interaction scheme for truncating the Hilbert space to only the most important determinants. We verify that this truncation introduces negligible error and use this new approach to simulate ASP for sets of small molecular systems and Hubbard models. Furthermore, we examine two approaches to speeding up ASP when performed on quantum hardware: (i) using the complete active space configuration interaction (CASCI) wave function instead of the Hartree-Fock initial state and (ii) a nonlinear interpolation between the initial and target Hamiltonians. We find that starting with a CASCI wave function with a limited active space yields substantial speedups for many of the systems examined, while nonlinear interpolation does not. In additional, we observe interesting trends in the minimum gap location (based on the initial state) as well as how state preparation time can depend on certain molecular properties, such as the number of valence electrons. Importantly, we find that the required state preparation times do not show an immediate exponential wall that would preclude an efficient run of ASP on actual hardware.

TI Realization of an Error-Correcting Surface Code with Superconducting
   Qubits
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB Quantum error correction is a critical technique for transitioning from noisy intermediate-scale quantum devices to fully fledged quantum computers. The surface code, which has a high threshold error rate, is the leading quantum error correction code for two-dimensional grid architecture. So far, the repeated error correction capability of the surface code has not been realized experimentally. Here, we experimentally implement an error-correcting surface code, the distance-three surface code which consists of 17 qubits, on the Zuchongzhi 2.1 superconducting quantum processor. By executing several consecutive error correction cycles, the logical error can be significantly reduced after applying corrections, achieving the repeated error correction of surface code for the first time. This experiment represents a fully functional instance of an error-correcting surface code, providing a key step on the path towards scalable fault-tolerant quantum computing.

TI Threshold theorem in isolated quantum dynamics with stochastic control
   errors
SO PHILOSOPHICAL TRANSACTIONS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY A-MATHEMATICAL PHYSICAL
   AND ENGINEERING SCIENCES
AB We investigate the effect of stochastic control errors in the time-dependent Hamiltonian on isolated quantum dynamics. The control errors are formulated as time-dependent stochastic noise in the Schrodinger equation. For a class of stochastic control errors, we establish a threshold theorem that provides a sufficient condition to obtain the target state, which should be determined in noiseless isolated quantum dynamics, as a relation between the number of measurements and noise strength. The theorem guarantees that if the sum of the noise strengths is less than the inverse of computational time, the target state can be obtained through a constant-order number of measurements. If the opposite is true, the number of measurements to guarantee obtaining the target state increases exponentially with computational time. Our threshold theorem can be applied to any isolated quantum dynamics such as quantum annealing and adiabatic quantum computation.This article is part of the theme issue 'Quantum annealing and computation: challenges and perspectives'.

TI A dataset for quantum circuit mapping
SO DATA IN BRIEF
AB Quantum computing is rapidly establishing itself as a new computing paradigm capable of obtaining advantages over its classical counterpart. However, a major limitation in the design of a quantum algorithm is related to the proper mapping of the corresponding circuit to a specific quantum processor so that the underlying physical constraints are satisfied. Moreover, current deterministic mapping algorithms suffer from high run times as the number of qubits to map increases. To bridge the gap in view of the next generation of quantum computers composed of thousands of qubits, this data paper proposes the first datasets that help address the quantum circuit mapping problem as a classification task. Each dataset is composed of random quantum circuits mapped onto a specific IBM quantum processor. In detail, each dataset instance contains some features related to the calibration data of the physical device and others related to the generated quantum circuit. Finally, the instance is labeled with a vector encoding the best mapping among those provided by deterministic mapping algorithms. Considering this, the proposed datasets allow the development of machine learning models capable of achieving mapping similar to those achieved with deterministic algorithms, but in a significantly shorter time.

TI Improved Low-Depth SHA3 Quantum Circuit for Fault-Tolerant Quantum
   Computers
SO APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL
AB To build a secure cryptography system in the post-quantum era, one must find the minimum security parameters against quantum attacks by estimating the quantum resources of a fault-tolerant quantum computer. In a fault-tolerant quantum computer, errors must reach an acceptable level for practical uses according to error detection and error correction processes. However, these processes utilize additional quantum resources. As the depth of the quantum circuit increases, the computation time per qubit increases together with the processing errors. Therefore, in terms of errors in quantum circuits, it is a fundamental requirement to reduce the depth by trading off the number of qubits. This paper proposes novel low-depth SHA3 quantum circuit implementations for fault-tolerant quantum computers to reduce errors. The proposed SHA3 quantum circuit was implemented with the aim of optimizing the quantum circuit depth through a trade-off between the number of qubits, the quantum gate, and the quantum depth in each function. Compared to other state-of-art techniques, the proposed method achieved T-depth and full-depth reductions of 30.3% and 80.05%, respectively. We believe that this work will contribute to the establishment of minimum security parameters for SHA3 in the quantum era.

TI Quantum image denoising: a framework via Boltzmann machines, QUBO, and
   quantum annealing
SO FRONTIERS IN COMPUTER SCIENCE
AB We investigate a framework for binary image denoising via restricted Boltzmann machines (RBMs) that introduces a denoising objective in quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO) form well-suited for quantum annealing. The denoising objective is attained by balancing the distribution learned by a trained RBM with a penalty term for derivations from the noisy image. We derive the statistically optimal choice of the penalty parameter assuming the target distribution has been well-approximated, and further suggest an empirically supported modification to make the method robust to that idealistic assumption. We also show under additional assumptions that the denoised images attained by our method are, in expectation, strictly closer to the noise-free images than the noisy images are. While we frame the model as an image denoising model, it can be applied to any binary data. As the QUBO formulation is well-suited for implementation on quantum annealers, we test the model on a D-Wave Advantage machine, and also test on data too large for current quantum annealers by approximating QUBO solutions through classical heuristics.

   with non-Gaussian operations: An exact closed form solution
SO RESULTS IN PHYSICS
AB In this paper, we derive a closed-form expression for the output state of a CV-QKD protocol in the presence of zero-photon catalysis (ZPC) and a quantum scissor (QS). Then, based on this closed-form solution, we use a direct search algorithm to find the appropriate values of input state and QS parameters, which considerably enhance the range and the fidelity of a CV-QKD protocol. In the special case of pure loss channel, the largest range of the protocol is only 6.5% less than the fundamental limit of repeaterless quantum communication. In addition, examination of the protocol for different values of excess noise, reveals that there is a trade-off between range and fidelity, and a high value of fidelity can be obtained at the cost of a slight reduction in protocol range.

TI Terahertz Quantum Imaging
SO ADVANCED QUANTUM TECHNOLOGIES
AB Quantum imaging offers a powerful method for spatially transferring amplitude and phase information between spectral regions of interest, even when separated by several orders of magnitude in photon energy. However, so far demonstrations have been limited to regions of similar orders of magnitude in frequency, where commercial cameras are available. Here, amplitude- and phase-sensitive imaging in the terahertz frequency region (1.5 THz) is demonstrated by detecting only visible photons (662.2 nm, 452.7 THz), separated by over two orders of magnitude. This allows reliable detection of terahertz information using a standard CMOS camera without cooling while still achieving spatial resolution close to the terahertz wavelength. The impact of strong noise contributions is reduced through quantum distillation.The experimental results are in good agreement with numerical simulations of the imaging process and demonstrate the huge potential of this method for exploring challenging spectral regions where conventional cameras are not available.

TI New space-efficient quantum algorithm for binary elliptic curves using
   the optimized division algorithm
SO QUANTUM INFORMATION PROCESSING
AB In the previous research on solving the elliptic curve discrete logarithm problem, quantum resources were concretely estimated. In Banegas et al. (IACR Trans Cryptogr Hardw Embed Syst 2021(1):451-472, 2020. https://doi.org/10.46586/tches.v2021.i1. 451-472), the quantum algorithm was optimized for binary elliptic curves, with the main optimization target being the number of the logical qubits. The division algorithm was primarily optimized in Banegas et al. (2020) since every ancillary qubit is used in the division algorithm. In this paper, we propose a new quantum division algorithm on the binary field that uses fewer qubits. Specifically, for elements in a field of 2(n), our algorithm saves n - 3left perpendicularlog nleft perpendicular - 2 qubits instead of using n(2) - 64n left perpendicularlog(n)left perpendicular + O(n) more Toffoli gates, which leads to amore space-efficient quantum algorithm for binary elliptic curves. For the small size n of 16, 127, 163, 233, 283 and 571, both the number of qubits and the number of Toffoli gates are actually reduced. When the size n is 571, the reduction in ancillary qubits amounts to approximately 23% compared to the previous algorithm.

TI Elastic energy driven multivariant selection in martensites via quantum
   annealing
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB We demonstrate the use of quantum annealing for the selection of multiple martensite variants in a microstructure with long-range coherency stresses and external mechanical load. The general approach is illustrated for martensites with four different variants based on the minimization of the linear elastic energy. The equilibrium variant distribution is then analyzed under application of tensile and shear strains and for different values of the considered shear and tetragonal contributions of the different martensite variants. The interface orientations between different domains of variants can be explained using the perspective of the elastic energy anisotropy for regular stripe patterns. For random grain orientations, the response to an external elastic strain is weaker and variant changes can be interpreted based on the rotated eigenstrain tensor.

TI Reinforcement learning pulses for transmon qubit entangling gates
SO MACHINE LEARNING-SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB The utility of a quantum computer is highly dependent on the ability to reliably perform accurate quantum logic operations. For finding optimal control solutions, it is of particular interest to explore model-free approaches, since their quality is not constrained by the limited accuracy of theoretical models for the quantum processor-in contrast to many established gate implementation strategies. In this work, we utilize a continuous control reinforcement learning algorithm to design entangling two-qubit gates for superconducting qubits; specifically, our agent constructs cross-resonance and CNOT gates without any prior information about the physical system. Using a simulated environment of fixed-frequency fixed-coupling transmon qubits, we demonstrate the capability to generate novel pulse sequences that outperform the standard cross-resonance gates in both fidelity and gate duration, while maintaining a comparable susceptibility to stochastic unitary noise. We further showcase an augmentation in training and input information that allows our agent to adapt its pulse design abilities to drifting hardware characteristics, importantly, with little to no additional optimization. Our results exhibit clearly the advantages of unbiased adaptive-feedback learning-based optimization methods for transmon gate design.

TI Unbiasing fermionic quantum Monte Carlo with a quantum computer
SO NATURE
AB Interacting many-electron problems pose some of the greatest computational challenges in science, with essential applications across many fields. The solutions to these problems will offer accurate predictions of chemical reactivity and kinetics, and other properties of quantum systems(1-4). Fermionic quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) methods(5,6), which use a statistical sampling of the ground state, are among the most powerful approaches to these problems. Controlling the fermionic sign problem with constraints ensures the efficiency of QMC at the expense of potentially significant biases owing to the limited flexibility of classical computation. Here we propose an approach that combines constrained QMC with quantum computation to reduce such biases. We implement our scheme experimentally using up to 16 qubits to unbias constrained QMC calculations performed on chemical systems with as many as 120 orbitals. These experiments represent the largest chemistry simulations performed with the help of quantum computers, while achieving accuracy that is competitive with state-of-the-art classical methods without burdensome error mitigation. Compared with the popularvariational quantum eigensolver(7,)(8), our hybrid quantum-classical computational model offers an alternative path towards achieving a practical quantum advantage for the electronic structure problem without demanding exceedingly accurate preparation and measurement of the ground-state wavefunction.

TI Solving differential-algebraic equations in power system dynamic
   analysis with quantum computing
SO ENERGY CONVERSION AND ECONOMICS
AB Power system dynamics are generally modeled by high dimensional non-linear differential-algebraic equations (DAEs) given a large number of components forming the network. These DAEs' complexity can grow exponentially due to the increasing penetration of distributed energy resources, whereas their computation time becomes sensitive due to the increasing interconnection of the power grid with other energy systems. This paper demonstrates the use of quantum computing algorithms to solve DAEs for power system dynamic analysis. We leverage a symbolic programming framework to equivalently convert the power system's DAEs into ordinary differential equations (ODEs) using index reduction methods and then encode their data into qubits using amplitude encoding. The system non-linearity is captured by Hamiltonian simulation with truncated Taylor expansion so that state variables can be updated by a quantum linear equation solver. Our results show that quantum computing can solve the power system's DAEs accurately with a computational complexity polynomial in the logarithm of the system dimension. We also illustrate the use of recent advanced tools in scientific machine learning for implementing complex computing concepts, that is, Taylor expansion, DAEs/ODEs transformation, and quantum computing solver with abstract representation for power engineering applications.

TI Quantum algorithm for the calculation of transition amplitudes in hybrid
   tensor networks
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB The hybrid tensor network approach allows us to perform calculations on systems larger than the scale of a quantum computer. However, when calculating transition amplitudes, there is the problem that the number of terms to be measured increases exponentially with that of the contracted operators. This problem is caused by the fact that the contracted operators are represented as non-Hermitian operators. In this study, we propose a method for hybrid tensor network calculation that contracts non-Hermitian operators without an exponential increase in the number of terms. In the proposed method, transition amplitudes are calculated by combining the singular value decomposition of the contracted non-Hermitian operators with a Hadamard test. The method significantly extends the applicability of the hybrid tensor network approach.

TI Digital Control of a Superconducting Qubit Using a Josephson Pulse
   Generator at 3 K
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB Scaling of quantum computers to fault-tolerant levels relies critically on the integration of energy-efficient, stable, and reproducible qubit control and readout electronics. In comparison to traditional semiconductor-control electronics (TSCE) located at room temperature, the signals generated by rf sources based on Josephson-junctions (Ms) benefit from small device sizes, low power dissipation, intrinsic calibration, superior reproducibility, and insensitivity to ambient fluctuations. Previous experiments to colocate qubits and JJ-based control electronics have resulted in quasiparticle poisoning of the qubit, degrading the coherence and lifetime of the qubit. In this paper, we digitally control a 0.01-K transmon qubit with pulses from a Josephson pulse generator (JPG) located at the 3-K stage of a dilution refrigerator. We directly compare the qubit lifetime T-1, the coherence time T-2*, and the thermal occupation P-th when the qubit is controlled by the JPG circuit versus the TSCE setup. We find agreement to within the daily fluctuations of +/- 0.5 mu s and +/- 2 mu s for T-1 and T-2, respectively, and agreement to within the 1% error for P-th. Additionally, we perform randomized benchmarking to measure an average JPG gate error of 2.1 x 10(-2). In combination with a small device size (< 25 mm(2)) and low on-chip power dissipation (<< 100 mu W), these results are an important step toward demonstrating the viability of using JJ-based control electronics located at temperature stages higher than the mixing-chamber stage in highly scaled superconducting quantum information systems.

TI Information scrambling and redistribution of quantum correlations
   through dynamical evolution in spin chains
SO QUANTUM INFORMATION PROCESSING
AB We investigate the propagation of local bipartite quantum correlations, along with the tripartite mutual information to characterize the information scrambling through dynamical evolution of spin chains. Starting from an initial state with the first pair of spins in a Bell state, we study how quantum correlations spread to other parts of the system, using different representative spin Hamiltonians, viz. the Heisenberg Model, a spin-conserving model, the transverse-field XY model, a non-conserving but integrable model, and the kicked Harper model, a spin conserving but nonintegrable model. We show that the local correlations spread consistently in the case of spin-conserving dynamics in both integrable and nonintegrable cases, with a strictly nonnegative tripartite mutual information. In contrast, in the case of non-conserving dynamics, tripartite mutual information is negative and local pair correlations do not propagate.

TI C60 Fullerene as an On-Demand Single Photon Source at Room
   Temperature
SO NANO LETTERS
AB Single photon sources are fundamental for applications in quantum computing, secure communication, and sensing, as they enable the generation of individual photons and ensure strict control over photon number statistics. However, current single photon sources can be limited by a lack of robustness, difficulty of integration into existing optical or electronic devices, and high cost. In this study, we present the use of off-the-shelf C60 fullerene molecules embedded in polystyrene as room-temperature reliable single-photon emitters. As our results demonstrate, these molecules exhibit on-demand single-photon emission, with short fluorescence lifetimes and, consequently, high emission rates. The wide availability and ease of preparation and manipulation of fullerenes as single photon sources can pave the way for the development of practical, economic and scalable quantum photonic technologies.

TI Quantum key distribution with two-way authentication
SO OPTICAL AND QUANTUM ELECTRONICS
AB Quantum key distribution uses the principle of quantum physics to realize unconditionally secure key distribution protocol. But this kind of security needs to be based on the authenticated classical channel. Although there are quantum key distribution protocols without classical channel, authentication is still needed. In the process of key distribution, authentication is not considered, which is also a problem of quantum key distribution protocol. In this paper, a quantum key distribution protocol with two-way authentication is proposed. Identity authentication is carried out at the same time of key distribution. If the identity authentication fails, the key distribution protocol cannot be carried out. If the key distribution protocol is aborted, the identity authentication is not successful. The conclusion of this paper is based on a central authentication system supported by symmetric encryption theory, which uses pseudo-random functions, multiple sets of quantum conjugate bases and Measurement-device-independent technology to simultaneously achieve two-way authentication and key distribution.

TI Quantum Voting Machine Encoded with Microwave Photons
SO CHINESE PHYSICS LETTERS
AB We propose a simple quantum voting machine using microwave photon qubit encoding, based on a setup comprising multiple microwave cavities and a coupled superconducting flux qutrit. This approach primarily relies on a multi-control single-target quantum phase gate. The scheme offers operational simplicity, requiring only a single step, while ensuring verifiability through the measurement of a single qubit phase information to obtain the voting results. It provides voter anonymity, as the voting outcome is solely tied to the total number of affirmative votes. Our quantum voting machine also has scalability in terms of the number of voters. Additionally, the physical realization of the quantum voting machine is general and not limited to circuit quantum electrodynamics. Quantum voting machine can be implemented as long as the multi-control single-phase quantum phase gate is realized in other physical systems. Numerical simulations indicate the feasibility of this quantum voting machine within the current quantum technology.

TI Low depth virtual distillation of quantum circuits by deterministic
   circuit decomposition
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Virtual distillation using measurements of multiple copies of a quantum circuit have recently been proposed as a method of noise mitigation of expectation values. Circuit decompositions known as B gates were found only for 1-local Hamiltonians, however practical problems for chemistry require n-local Hamiltonians, which cannot be corrected with B gates. We discover low depth circuit decompositions for expectation values for n-local Pauli strings by combining multiple projections to recover the correct measurement statistics or expectation values. Our method adds linear entangling gates with the number of qubits, but it requires extra measurements. Furthermore, in applications to find ground states such as the variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) algorithm, the variational principle is required which states that the energy cannot go below the ground-state energy. We find that the variational principle is violated when using B gates and is preserved if we use our low depth decomposition on all expectation values. We perform a demonstration on real devices, and we show that our decomposition can mitigate real experimental noise in VQE for the H2 2 molecule with a two-qubit tapered mapping, H3 3 with three qubits, and H2 2 with four qubits. Our decomposition provides a way to perform duplicate circuit virtual distillation on real devices at significantly lower depth and for arbitrary observables.

TI Deterministic loading of a single strontium ion into a surface electrode
   trap using pulsed laser ablation
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICS COMMUNICATIONS
AB Trapped-ion quantum technologies have been developed for decades toward applications such as precision measurement, quantum communication and quantum computation. Coherent manipulation of ions' oscillatory motions in an ion trap is important for quantum information processing by ions, however, unwanted decoherence caused by fluctuating electric-field environment often hinders stable and high-fidelity operations. One way to avoid this is to adopt pulsed laser ablation for ion loading, a loading method with significantly reduced pollution and heat production. Despite the usefulness of the ablation loading such as the compatibility with cryogenic environment, randomness of the number of loaded ions is still problematic in realistic applications where definite number of ions are preferably loaded with high probability. In this paper, we demonstrate an efficient loading of a single strontium ion into a surface electrode trap generated by laser ablation and successive photoionization. The probability of single-ion loading into a surface electrode trap is measured to be 82%, and such a deterministic single-ion loading allows for loading ions into the trap one-by-one. Our results open up a way to develop more functional ion-trap quantum devices by the clean, stable, and deterministic ion loading.

TI Quantum sensing with optically accessible spin defects in van der Waals
   layered materials
SO LIGHT-SCIENCE & APPLICATIONS
AB Quantum sensing has emerged as a powerful technique to detect and measure physical and chemical parameters with exceptional precision. One of the methods is to use optically active spin defects within solid-state materials. These defects act as sensors and have made significant progress in recent years, particularly in the realm of two-dimensional (2D) spin defects. In this article, we focus on the latest trends in quantum sensing that use spin defects in van der Waals (vdW) materials. We discuss the benefits of combining optically addressable spin defects with 2D vdW materials while highlighting the challenges and opportunities to use these defects. To make quantum sensing practical and applicable, the article identifies some areas worth further exploration. These include identifying spin defects with properties suitable for quantum sensing, generating quantum defects on demand with control of their spatial localization, understanding the impact of layer thickness and interface on quantum sensing, and integrating spin defects with photonic structures for new functionalities and higher emission rates. The article explores the potential applications of quantum sensing in several fields, such as superconductivity, ferromagnetism, 2D nanoelectronics, and biology. For instance, combining nanoscale microfluidic technology with nanopore and quantum sensing may lead to a new platform for DNA sequencing. As materials technology continues to evolve, and with the advancement of defect engineering techniques, 2D spin defects are expected to play a vital role in quantum sensing.

TI Semiconductor-on-diamond cavities for spin optomechanics
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB Optomechanical cavities are powerful tools for classical and quantum information processing that can be realized using nanophotonic structures that co-localize optical and mechanical resonances. Typically, phononic localization requires suspended devices that forbid vertical leakage of mechanical energy. Achieving this in some promising quantum photonic materials such as diamond requires non-standard nanofabrication techniques, while hindering integration with other components and exacerbating heating related challenges. As an alternative, we have developed a semiconductor-on-diamond platform that co-localizes phononic and photonic modes without requiring undercutting. We have designed an optomechanical crystal cavity that combines high optomechanical coupling with low dissipation, and we show that this platform will enable optomechanical coupling to spin qubits in the diamond substrate. These properties demonstrate the promise of this platform for realizing quantum information processing devices based on spin, phonon, and photon interactions.

TI Squeezing below the ground state of motion of a continuously monitored

SO QUANTUM SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB Squeezing is a crucial resource for quantum information processing and quantum sensing. In levitated nanomechanics, squeezed states of motion can be generated via temporal control of the trapping frequency of a massive particle. However, the amount of achievable squeezing typically suffers from detrimental environmental effects. We propose a scheme for the generation of significant levels of mechanical squeezing in the motional state of a levitated nanoparticle by leveraging on the careful temporal control of the trapping potential. We analyse the performance of such a scheme by fully accounting for the most relevant sources of noise, including measurement backaction. The feasibility of our proposal, which is close to experimental state-of-the-art, makes it a valuable tool for quantum state engineering.

TI All-optical nuclear quantum sensing using nitrogen-vacancy centers in
   diamond
SO NPJ QUANTUM INFORMATION
AB Solid state spins have demonstrated significant potential in quantum sensing with applications including fundamental science, medical diagnostics and navigation. The quantum sensing schemes showing best performance under ambient conditions all utilize microwave or radio-frequency driving, which poses a significant limitation for miniaturization, energy efficiency, and non-invasiveness of quantum sensors. We overcome this limitation by demonstrating a purely optical approach to coherent quantum sensing. Our scheme involves the N-15 nuclear spin of the Nitrogen-Vacancy (NV) center in diamond as a sensing resource, and exploits NV spin dynamics in oblique magnetic fields near the NV's excited state level anti-crossing to optically pump the nuclear spin into a quantum superposition state. We demonstrate all-optical free-induction decay measurements-the key protocol for low-frequency quantum sensing-both on single spins and spin ensembles. Our results pave the way for highly compact quantum sensors to be employed for magnetometry or gyroscopy applications in challenging environments.

TI Nitrogen plasma passivated niobium resonators for superconducting
   quantum circuits
SO APPLIED PHYSICS LETTERS
AB Microwave loss in niobium metallic structures used for superconducting quantum circuits is limited by a native surface oxide layer formed over a timescale of minutes when exposed to an ambient environment. In this work, we show that nitrogen plasma treatment forms a niobium nitride layer at the metal-air interface, which prevents such oxidation. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy confirms the doping of nitrogen more than 5 nm into the surface and a suppressed oxygen presence. This passivation remains stable after aging for 15 days in an ambient environment. Cryogenic microwave characterization shows an average filling-factor-adjusted two-level-system loss tangent F delta(TLS) of (2,9 +/- 0.5) . 10(-7) for resonators with a 3 mu m center strip and (1.0 +/- 0.3) . 10(-7) for a 20 mu m center strip, exceeding the performance of unpassivated samples by a factor of four.

TI Dynamics of the atom-polyatomic molecule conversion with quantum
   decoherence
SO PHYSICA SCRIPTA
AB Based on the mean-field approximation and the two-mode Bose-Hubbard model, we investigate the dynamical properties of atom-polyatomic molecule conversion systems under dissipation and dephasing. For such a many-body system problem, we partition phase space based on the states of fixed points, study the movement of fixed points and the transition to attractors in an open system. Additionally, for all the atoms that constitute a molecule, depending on whether the species of these atoms are identical or not, we introduce the innovative concepts of unbiased and biased systems. We discover that in biased conversion systems under particle losses, the evolution trajectories are distributed on a three-dimensional Bloch sphere with an internal structure. There exists a significant difference from the two-dimensional Hilbert space of an unbiased system. Finally, we discuss the sweeping rate of the time-varying magnetic field applied externally to the conversion system, and analyze a feasible scheme for the quantum coherent synthesis of triatomic molecules.

TI x2DL: A high throughput architecture for
   binary-ring-learning-with-error-based post quantum cryptography schemes
SO IET QUANTUM COMMUNICATION
AB Lattice-based cryptography is one of the most promising cryptographic scheme which lies on the hardness of ring-learning-with-error (RLWE). A new variant of RLWE, known as binary-ring-learning-with-error (BRLWE), has less key size and more efficient hardware implementations compared to RLWE-based schemes. The key arithmetic operation for BRLWE-based encryption scheme is the implementation of arithmetic operation represented by FD+H, where both F and H are integer polynomials, and D is a binary polynomial. An efficient architecture to perform the arithmetic operation FD+H over a polynomial ring x(n)+1 is proposed. We employ two linear feedback shift register structures comprising x(2)-net units in our design to reduce the computational time. This reduction in computational time yields to a significant improvement in the other performance metrics such as delay, area-delay product (ADP), power-delay product, throughput and efficiency compared to the existing designs. As per the experimental results, the authors' proposed design has 32% improvement in ADP when compared to the recently reported work.

TI An experimental setup to generate narrowband bi-photons via four-wave
   mixing in cold atoms
SO REVISTA MEXICANA DE FISICA
AB We present our recently-built experimental setup designed to generate near-infrared and narrow-band correlated photon pairs by inducing four-wave mixing in a cold gas of Rb-87 atoms confined in a magneto-optical trap. The experimental setup and its automation and control approach are described in detail. A characterization of the optical density of the atomic ensemble as well as the basic statistical measurements of the generated light are reported. The non-classical nature of the photon pairs is confirmed by observing a violation of Cauchy-Schwarz inequality by a factor of 5.6 x10(5) in a Hanbury Brown - Twiss interferometer. A 1/e coherence time for the heralded, idler photons of 4.4 +/- 0.1 ns is estimated from our observations. We are able to achieve a value of 10(4) s(-1 )pair-detection-rate, which results in a spectral brightness of 280 (MHz s)(-1) . The combination of high brightness and narrow-band spectrum makes this photon-pair source a viable tool in fundamental studies of quantum states and opens the door to use them in quantum technologies.

TI Quantum annealing-aided design of an ultrathin-metamaterial optical
   diode
SO NANO CONVERGENCE
AB Thin-film optical diodes are important elements for miniaturizing photonic systems. However, the design of optical diodes relies on empirical and heuristic approaches. This poses a significant challenge for identifying optimal structural models of optical diodes at given wavelengths. Here, we leverage a quantum annealing-enhanced active learning scheme to automatically identify optimal designs of 130 nm-thick optical diodes. An optical diode is a stratified volume diffractive film discretized into rectangular pixels, where each pixel is assigned to either a metal or dielectric. The proposed scheme identifies the optimal material states of each pixel, maximizing the quality of optical isolation at given wavelengths. Consequently, we successfully identify optimal structures at three specific wavelengths (600, 800, and 1000 nm). In the best-case scenario, when the forward transmissivity is 85%, the backward transmissivity is 0.1%. Electromagnetic field profiles reveal that the designed diode strongly supports surface plasmons coupled across counterintuitive metal-dielectric pixel arrays. Thereby, it yields the transmission of first-order diffracted light with a high amplitude. In contrast, backward transmission has decoupled surface plasmons that redirect Poynting vectors back to the incident medium, resulting in near attenuation of its transmission. In addition, we experimentally verify the optical isolation function of the optical diode.

TI Entanglement in Quantum Systems Based on Directed Graphs
SO ADVANCED QUANTUM TECHNOLOGIES
AB The entanglement properties of quantum states associated with directed graphs are investigated. Using a measure derived from the Fubini-Study metric, multipartite entanglement is quantitatively related to the local connectivity of the graph. In Entanglement in Directed Graph States (2025), arXiv:2505.10716, it is demonstrated that the vertex degree distribution fully determines this entanglement measure and remains invariant under vertex relabeling, highlighting its topological character. As a consequence, the measure depends only on the total degree of each vertex, making it independent of the distinction between incoming and outgoing edges. This framework is applied to several specific graph structures, including hierarchical networks, neural network-inspired graphs, full binary tree and linear bridged cycle graphs, demonstrating how their combinatorial properties influence entanglement distribution. These results provide a geometric perspective on quantum correlations in complex systems, offering potential applications in the design and analysis of quantum networks.

TI Quantum multiphoton Rabi oscillations in waveguide QED
SO NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB The future of quantum information processing hinges on chip-scale nanophotonics, specifically cavity QED and waveguide QED. One of the foremost processes underpinning quantum photonic technologies is the phenomenon of Rabi oscillations, which manifests when a qubit is irradiated by an intense laser source. Departing from the conventional semiclassical framework, we explore the more general, quantum theoretical case where the optical excitation takes the form of a multiphoton Fock state, and the qubit couples to a continuum of radiation modes. By employing the real-space formalism, we analytically explore the scattering dynamics of the photonic Fock state as it interfaces with a two-level emitter. The resulting amplitude for atomic excitation features a linear superposition of various independent scattering events that are triggered by the potential of sequential, time-delayed photon absorptions and emissions. The lowest-order excitation event, initiated by the stochastic scattering of one of the several photons, appropriately characterizes the dynamics in a weak-field environment. This event is complemented by a multitude of higher-order scattering events ensuing from repeated atom-photon interactions. The temporal evolution of the qubit excitation in our configuration closely mirrors the semiclassical predictions, particularly in the strong-pumping limit where Rabi oscillations unfold. Notably, this compatibility with the semiclassical paradigm transcends beyond the strong-excitation regime and applies both to the weak-driving and large-detuning limits. In a nutshell, our analysis extends the existing results on quantum Rabi oscillations pertinent to single-mode cavity QED, to the multimode, waveguide-QED configurations wherein flying photons are the information carriers. Additionally, we delve into the dynamics of pulsed wave packets, shedding light on the potential to substantially enhance excitation efficiency, even in scenarios involving just a few photons. Beyond their theoretical merit, these findings should hold practical relevance for future Fock-state-based quantum computing and emerging waveguide-integrated photonic technologies such as those involving superconducting circuitry.

TI Enabling quantum sensing under extreme pressure: Nitrogen-vacancy
   magnetometry up to 130 GPa
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
AB Engineering a layer of nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers on the tip of a diamond anvil creates a multipurpose quantum sensor array for high-pressure measurements, especially for probing the magnetic and superconducting properties of materials. Expanding this concept above 100 GPa appears to be a substantial challenge. We observe that deviatoric stress on the anvil tip sets a limit at 40-50 GPa for practical magnetic measurements based on the optically detected magnetic resonance (ODMR) of NV centers under pressure. We show that this limit can be circumvented up to at least 130 GPa by machining a micropillar on the anvil tip to create a quasihydrostatic stress environment for the NV centers. Improved hydrostaticity is quantified using the pressure dependence of the diamond Raman shift, the NV ODMR dependence on applied magnetic field, and NV photoluminescence spectral shift. This paves the way for the reliable use of NV microsensing at pressures above 100 GPa.

To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that an 800 Gbps quantum-secured optical channel-along with several other dense wavelength division multiplexed channels on the C-band and multiplexed with the QKD channel on the O-band-was established at distances up to 100 km, with secret key-rates relevant for practical industry use cases. In addition, during the course of these trials, transporting a blockchain application over this established channel was utilized as a demonstration of securing a financial transaction in transit over a quantum-secured optical channel.

TI Noise Reduction in Qubit Readout with a Two-Mode Squeezed Interferometer
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW APPLIED
AB Fault-tolerant quantum information processing with flawed qubits and gates requires highly efficient, quantum nondemolition qubit readout. In superconducting circuits, qubit readout using coherent light with fidelity above 99% has been achieved by using quantum limited parametric amplifiers such as the Josephson parametric converter (JPC). However, further improvement of such measurement faces many challenges, including the vacuum fluctuation of the coherent light that limits measurement fidelity. In this work we demonstrate dispersive qubit readout with a two-mode squeezed light interferometer formed by two JPCs. The first JPC generates two-mode squeezed vacuum at its output, which is coherently recombined by the second JPC after one branch is phase shifted and displaced by its interaction with the qubit-cavity system on that arm of the interferometer. We observe a 31% improvement in the power signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of projective readout after replacing vacuum fluctuation in the readout cavity with two-mode squeezed vacuum containing on average one photon. This demonstrates a more efficient way of improving SNR than by increasing readout power. Furthermore, we investigate the quantum properties of the two-mode squeezed light in the system through weak measurement. Surprisingly, we find that tuning the interferometer to be less projective increases the measurement efficiency relative to the optimum setting for projective measurement. These enhancements may enable remote entanglement with lower efficiency components in a system with qubits in both arms of the interferometer.

AB Flat-band systems provide an ideal platform for exploring exotic quantum phenomena, where the strongly suppressed kinetic energy in these flat energy bands suggests the potential for exotic phases driven by geometric structure, disorder, and interactions. While intriguing phenomena and physical mechanisms have been unveiled in theoretical models, synthesizing such systems within scalable quantum platforms remains challenging. Here, we present the experimental realization of a pi-flux rhombic system using a two-dimensional superconducting qubit array with tunable coupling. We experimentally observe characteristic dynamics, e.g., pi-flux driven destructive interference, and demonstrate the protocol for eigenstate preparation in this rhombic array with coupler-assisted flux. Our results provide future possibilities for exploring the interplay of geometry, interactions, and quantum information encoding in such degenerate systems.

TI Dynamics of quantum information scrambling under decoherence effects
   measured via active spin clusters
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Developing quantum technologies requires the control and understanding of the nonequilibrium dynamics of quantum information in many-body systems. Local information propagates in the system by creating complex correlations known as information scrambling, as this process prevents extracting the information from local measurements. In this paper, we develop a model adapted from solid-state NMR methods, to quantify the information scrambling. The scrambling is measured via time-reversal Loschmidt echo (LE) and multiple quantum coherences experiments that intrinsically contain imperfections. Considering these imperfections, we derive expressions for out-of-time order correlators (OTOCs) to quantify the observable information scrambling based on measuring the number of active spins where the information was spread. Based on the OTOC expressions, decoherence effects arise naturally by the effects of the nonreverted terms in the LE experiment. Decoherence induces localization of the measurable degree of information scrambling. These effects define a localization cluster size for the observable number of active spins that determines a dynamical equilibrium. We contrast the model's predictions with quantum simulations performed with solid-state NMR experiments, that measure the information scrambling with time-reversal echoes with controlled imperfections. An excellent quantitative agreement is found with the dynamics of quantum information scrambling and its localization effects determined from the experimental data. The presented model and derived OTOCs set tools for quantifying the quantum information dynamics of large quantum systems (more than 104 spins) consistent with experimental implementations that intrinsically contain imperfections.

TI A Quantum Algorithm for Solving Eigenproblem of the Laplacian Matrix of
   a Fully Connected Weighted Graph
SO ADVANCED QUANTUM TECHNOLOGIES
AB Solving eigenproblem of the Laplacian matrix of a fully connected weighted graph has wide applications in data science, machine learning, and image processing, etc. However, this is very challenging because it involves expensive matrix operations. Here, an efficient quantum algorithm is proposed to solve it. Specifically, the optimal Hamiltonian simulation technique based on the block-encoding framework is adopted to implement the quantum simulation of the Laplacian matrix. Then, the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the Laplacian matrix are extracted by the quantum phase estimation algorithm. The core of this entire algorithm is to construct a block-encoding of the Laplacian matrix. To achieve this, how to construct block-encoding of operators containing the information of the weight matrix and the degree matrix, respectively are shown in detail, and the block-encoding of the Laplacian matrix is further obtained. Compared with its classical counterpart, this algorithm has a polynomial speedup on the number of vertices and an exponential speedup on the dimension of each vertex. It is also shown that this algorithm can be extended to solve the eigenproblem of symmetric (non-symmetric) normalized Laplacian matrix.

TI The Effect of Penalty Factors of Constrained Hamiltonians on the
   Eigenspectrum in Quantum Annealing
SO ACM TRANSACTIONS ON QUANTUM COMPUTING
AB Constrained optimization problems are usually translated to (naturally unconstrained) Ising formulations by introducing soft penalty terms for the previously hard constraints. In this work, we empirically demonstrate that assigning the appropriate weight to these penalty terms leads to an enlargement of the minimum spectral gap in the corresponding eigenspectrum, which also leads to a better solution quality on actual quantum annealing hardware. We apply machine learning methods to analyze the correlations of the penalty factors and the minimum spectral gap for six selected constrained optimization problems and show that regression using a neural network allows to predict the best penalty factors in our settings for various problem instances. Additionally, we observe that problem instances with a single global optimum are easier to optimize in contrast to ones with multiple global optima.

TI Multiplexed readout of superconducting qubits using a three-dimensional
   reentrant-cavity filter
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW APPLIED
AB Hardware-efficient methods for high-fidelity quantum state measurements are crucial for superconducting qubit experiments, as qubit numbers grow and feedback and state reset begin to be employed for quantum error correction. We present a three-dimensional reentrant-cavity filter designed for frequencymultiplexed readout of superconducting qubits. The cavity filter is situated out of the plane of the qubit circuit and capacitively couples to an array of on-chip readout resonators in a manner that can scale to large qubit arrays. The reentrant cavity functions as a large-linewidth bandpass filter with intrinsic Purcell filtering. We demonstrate the concept with a four-qubit multiplexed device in which we achieve an average readout fidelity of 98.6% and measurement-induced crosstalk dephasing rates below 0.15 kHz.

TI Proof-of-Concept Quantum Simulator Based on Molecular Spin Qudits
SO JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN CHEMICAL SOCIETY
AB The use of d-level qudits instead of two-level qubits can largely increase the power of quantum logic for many applications, ranging from quantum simulations to quantum error correction. Magnetic molecules are ideal spin systems to realize these large-dimensional qudits. Indeed, their Hamiltonian can be engineered to an unparalleled extent and can yield a spectrum with many low-energy states. In particular, in the past decade, intense theoretical, experimental, and synthesis efforts have been devoted to develop quantum simulators based on molecular qubits and qudits. However, this remarkable potential is practically unexpressed, because no quantum simulation has ever been experimentally demonstrated with these systems. Here, we show the first prototype quantum simulator based on an ensemble of molecular qudits and a radiofrequency broadband spectrometer. To demonstrate the operativity of the device, we have simulated quantum tunneling of the magnetization and the transverse-field Ising model, representative of two different classes of problems. These results represent an important step toward the actual use of molecular spin qudits in quantum technologies.

The resulting code CFTs exhibit a global & Zopf;2 symmetry, enabling us to perform the & Zopf;2-gauging to derive their orbifolded and fermionized theories when the symmetry is non-anomalous. We classify a subset of these subsystem code CFTs using weighted oriented graphs and enumerate those with small central charges. Consequently, we identify several bosonic code CFTs self-dual under the & Zopf;2-orbifold, new supersymmetric code CFTs, and a few fermionic code CFTs with spontaneously broken supersymmetry.

TI Contraction of ZX diagrams with triangles via stabiliser decompositions
SO PHYSICA SCRIPTA
AB Recent advances in classical simulation of Clifford+T circuits make use of the ZX calculus to iteratively decompose and simplify magic states into stabiliser terms We improve on this method by studying stabiliser decompositions of ZX diagrams involving the triangle operation. We show that this technique greatly speeds up the simulation of quantum circuits involving multi-controlled gates which can be naturally represented using triangles. We implement our approach in the QuiZX library (2022 A. Kissinger amd J. van de Wetering Quantum Science and Technology 7, 044001), (2022 A. Kissinger et al F. Le Gall and T. Morimae, ed. 17th Conference on the Theory of Quantum Computation, Communication and Cryptography (TQC 2022), Leibniz International Proceedings in Informatics (LIPIcs) 232, Schloss Dagstuhl-Leibniz-Zentrum f & uuml;r Informatik, Dagstuhl, Germany, pp 5:1-5:13) and demonstrate a significant simulation speed-up (up to multiple orders of magnitude) for random circuits and a variation of previously used benchmarking circuits. Furthermore, we use our software to contract diagrams representing the gradient variance of parametrised quantum circuits, which yields a tool for the automatic numerical detection of the barren plateau phenomenon in ans & auml;tze used for quantum machine learning. Compared to traditional statistical approaches, our method yields exact values for gradient variances and only requires contracting a single diagram. The performance of this tool is competitive with tensor network approaches, as demonstrated with benchmarks against the quimb library (2018 J. Gray Journal of Open Source Software 3, 819).

TI Efficient quantum state tracking in noisy environments
SO QUANTUM SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB Quantum state tomography, which aims to find the best description of a quantum state-the density matrix, is an essential building block in quantum computation and communication. Standard techniques for state tomography are incapable of tracking changing states and often perform poorly in the presence of environmental noise. Although there are different approaches to solve these problems theoretically, experimental demonstrations have so far been sparse. Our approach, matrix-exponentiated gradient (MEG) tomography, is an online tomography method that allows for state tracking, updates the estimated density matrix dynamically from the very first measurements, is computationally efficient, and converges to a good estimate quickly even with very noisy data. The algorithm is controlled via a single parameter, its learning rate, which determines the performance and can be tailored in simulations to the individual experiment. We present an experimental implementation of MEG tomography on a qutrit system encoded in the transverse spatial mode of photons. We investigate the performance of our method on stationary and evolving states, as well as significant environmental noise, and find fidelities of around 95% in all cases.

TI Superconducting quasiparticle-amplifying transmon: A qubit-based sensor

SO PHYSICAL REVIEW APPLIED
AB With great interest from the quantum computing community, an immense amount of R&D effort has been invested into improving superconducting qubits. The technologies developed for the design and fabrication of these qubits can be directly applied to applications for ultralow-threshold particle detectors, e.g., low-mass dark matter and far-infrared photon sensing. We propose a novel energy-resolving sensor based on the transmon qubit architecture combined with a signal-enhancing superconducting quasiparticle amplification stage. We refer to these sensors as SQUATs: superconducting quasiparticle-amplifying transmons. We detail the operating principle and design of this new sensor and predict that, with minimal R&D effort, solid-state-based detectors patterned with these sensors can achieve sensitivity to single terahertz photons, and sensitivity to 1 meV phonons in the detector absorber substrate on the microsecond timescale.

TI LLM-generated tips rival expert-created tips in helping students answer
   quantum-computing questions
SO EPJ QUANTUM TECHNOLOGY
AB Alleviating high workloads for teachers is crucial for continuous high quality education. To evaluate if Large Language Models (LLMs) can alleviate this problem in the quantum computing domain, we conducted two complementary studies exploring the use of GPT-4 to automatically generate tips for students. (1) A between-subject survey in which students (N = 46) solved four multiple-choice quantum computing questions with either the help of expert-created or LLMgenerated tips. To correct for possible biases, we additionally introduced two deception conditions. (2) Experienced educators and students (N = 23) directly compared the LLM-generated and expert-created tips. Our results show that the LLM-generated tips were significantly more helpful and pointed better towards relevant concepts while also giving away more of the answers. Furthermore, we found that participants in the first study performed significantly better in answering the quantum computing questions when given tips labeled as LLM-generated, even if they were expert-created. This points towards a placebo effect induced by the participants' biases for LLM-generated content. Ultimately, we contribute that LLM-generated tips can be used instead of expert tips to support teaching of quantum computing basics.

AB We use hyperentanglement to experimentally realize deterministic entanglement swapping based on quantum elegant joint measurements. These are joint projections of two qubits onto highly symmetric, isoentangled bases. We report measurement fidelities no smaller than 97.4%. We showcase the applications of these measurements by using the entanglement swapping procedure to demonstrate quantum correlations in the form of proof-of-principle violations of both bilocal Bell inequalities and more stringent correlation criteria corresponding to full network nonlocality. Our results are a foray into entangled measurements and nonlocality beyond the paradigmatic Bell state measurement and they show the relevance of more general measurements in entanglement swapping scenarios.

TI Scalable Implementation of Temporal and Phase Encoding QKD with
   Phase-Randomized States
SO ADVANCED QUANTUM TECHNOLOGIES
AB Quantum key distribution (QKD), that is, exchanging cryptographic keys encoded in quantum particles exploiting the laws of quantum physics, is already a reality in our society. Current implementations are based on attenuated laser technique, a practical replacement of single photons which requires a random phase for each quantum state in order to achieve the highest level of security. In particular, the time-bin and phase encoding techniques are mainly exploiting laser in gain-switching modes combined with asymmetric interferometers or multiple laser sources in a master-slave configuration, which present limitations in terms of stability and scalability. In this work, a novel scheme for implementing a reconfigurable and scalable QKD transmitter based on the time-bin encoding protocol with a decoy-state method employing phase-randomized weak coherent states is proposed and demonstrated. The scheme is tested and validated up to 26 dB-attenuation channel using standard single-photon detectors working in the telecom wavelength range.

TI Real-time frequency estimation of a qubit without single-shot-readout
SO QUANTUM SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB Quantum sensors can potentially achieve the Heisenberg limit of sensitivity over a large dynamic range using quantum algorithms. The adaptive phase estimation algorithm (PEA) is one example that was proven to achieve such high sensitivities with single-shot readout (SSR) sensors. However, using the adaptive PEA on a non-SSR sensor is not trivial due to the low contrast nature of the measurement. The standard approach to account for the averaged nature of the measurement in this PEA algorithm is to use a method based on 'majority voting'. Although it is easy to implement, this method is more prone to mistakes due to noise in the measurement. To reduce these mistakes, a binomial distribution technique from a batch selection was recently shown theoretically to be superior, as all ranges of outcomes from an averaged measurement are considered. Here we apply, for the first time, real-time non-adaptive PEA on a non-SSR sensor with the binomial distribution approach. We compare the mean square error of the binomial distribution method to the majority-voting approach using the nitrogen-vacancy center in diamond at ambient conditions as a non-SSR sensor. Our results suggest that the binomial distribution approach achieves better accuracy with the same sensing times. To further shorten the sensing time, we propose an adaptive algorithm that controls the readout phase and, therefore, the measurement basis set. We show by numerical simulation that adding the adaptive protocol can further improve the accuracy in a future real-time experiment.

TI Multi-objective Quantum Annealing approach for solving flexible job shop
   scheduling in manufacturing
SO JOURNAL OF MANUFACTURING SYSTEMS
AB Flexible Job Shop Scheduling (FJSSP) is a challenging optimization problem with multiple conflicting objectives used to model and compute real-world process scheduling tasks. In order for a manufacturing system to remain competitive, it is necessary to compute such optimization problems quickly and efficiently. The limitations of conventional optimization methods frequently stem from a delicate balance between solution quality and computation time. Consequently, a pressing need for solution algorithms arises that can effectively transcend these limitations. This paper presents a novel Quantum Annealing-based solving algorithm (QASA) for computing FJSSP, leveraging the power of Quantum Annealing combined with classical techniques. The proposed approach aims to optimize a multi-criterial FJSSP considering makespan, total workload, and job priority simultaneously. QASA employs a Hamiltonian formulation with Lagrange parameters to integrate the problem's constraints and objectives. By assigning appropriate weights to the objectives, the method allows the prioritization of certain objectives over others. To handle the computational complexity of large FJSSP instances, the problem is decomposed into smaller subproblems, and a decision logic based on bottleneck factors is employed to select critical jobs for computation combined with variable pruning techniques. To evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, experiments are conducted on benchmark problems, considering makespan, total workload, and priority objectives. Therefore, QASA combining tabu search, simulated annealing, and Quantum Annealing is used for efficient computation and is compared with a classical solving algorithm (CSA) combining tabu search and simulated annealing. The results demonstrate that QASA outperforms CSA in terms of solution quality, as measured by set coverage and hypervolume ratio metrics. Furthermore, computational efficiency analysis reveals that QASA achieves superior Pareto solutions compared to the classical approach, with a reasonable increase in computation time.

TI Subharmonic Control of a Fluxonium Qubit via a Purcell-Protected Flux
   Line
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB Protecting qubits from environmental noise while maintaining strong coupling for fast high-fidelity control is a central challenge for quantum information processing. Here, we demonstrate a control scheme for superconducting fluxonium qubits that eliminates qubit decay through the control channel by suppressing the environmental density of states at the transition frequency. Adding a low-pass filter on the flux line allows for flux-biasing and, at the same time, coherently controlling the fluxonium qubit by parametrically driving it at integer fractions of its transition frequency. We compare the filtered to the unfiltered configuration and find a 5-times-longer T1, and a 10-times-improved T2-echo time in the filtered case. We demonstrate coherent control with up to 11-photon subharmonic drives, highlighting the strong nonlinearity of the fluxonium potential. Measured Rabi frequencies and drive-induced frequency shifts show excellent agreement with numerical and analytical models. Furthermore, we show the equivalence of a 3-photon subharmonic drive to an on-resonance drive by benchmarking subharmonic gate fidelities above 99.94%. These results open up a scalable path for full qubit control through a single Purcell-protected channel, providing strong suppression of control-induced decoherence and enabling wiring-efficient superconducting quantum processors.

TI Entangling Power and Quantum Circuit Complexity
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB Notions of circuit complexity and cost play a key role in quantum computing and simulation where they capture the (weighted) minimal number of gates that is required to implement a unitary. Similar notions also become increasingly prominent in high energy physics in the study of holography. While notions of entanglement have in general little implications for the quantum circuit complexity and the cost of a unitary, in this work, we discuss a simple such relationship when both the entanglement of a state and the cost of a unitary take small values, building on ideas on how values of entangling power of quantum gates add up. This bound implies that if entanglement entropies grow linearly in time, so does the cost. The implications are twofold: It provides insights into complexity growth for short times. In the context of quantum simulation, it allows us to compare digital and analog quantum simulators. The main technical contribution is a continuous-variable small incremental entangling bound.

TI Photon-phonon entanglement in the acousto-optic interaction of vector
   beams
SO RESULTS IN OPTICS
AB We demonstrate that acousto-optic diffraction under certain conditions can be accompanied by inter-system photon-phonon entanglement. A photon diffracted during Stokes acousto-optic interaction of acoustic and optical vector beams represents a vector beam that manifests the intra-system entanglement between its states characterized by the different signs of circular polarization and orbital angular momentum. At the same time, a diffracted photon and an acoustic phonon emitted in the process of acousto-optic interaction demonstrate the inter-system entanglement between their circularly polarized vortex states.

TI High-Efficiency Multi-Standard Polynomial Multiplication Accelerator on
   RISC-V SoC for Post-Quantum Cryptography
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB Number Theoretic Transform (NTT) enables speeding up polynomial multiplications, thereby accelerating the implementation of lattice-based post-quantum cryptography (PQC) algorithms. Currently, the standardized PQC algorithms FIPS 203 (CRYSTALS-Kyber), FIPS 204 (CRYSTALS-Dilithium), and the one in the process of being standardized FIPS 206 (FALCON) all use the NTT to perform polynomial multiplication. This paper proposes a high-speed, low-complexity, and run-time configurable accelerator that supports all three standards. Firstly, we propose a unified design using four parallel radix-2 butterflies targeting a high-speed polynomial multiplier. With a unified design, the accelerator performs NTT, inverse NTT (INTT), point-wise multiplication (PWM), and matrix-vector polynomial multiplication. Secondly, we propose a compact, configurable reordering unit for effective coefficient processing in high-parallelism. As a bonus, the required memory size is minimal, and the memory access pattern is straightforward. Finally, we present a RISC-V SoC architecture with a loosely coupled accelerator through register-map communication and the data flow to accelerate NTT-based operation in software. The FPGA implementation results show that the achieved speed for NTT/INTT/PWM executions is 224/224/64 clock cycles (CCs) for Kyber, 512/512/128 CCs for Dilithium, 576/576/128 CCs for FALCON-512, and 1280/1280/256 CCs for FALCON-1024, respectively. The Area $\times $ Time Product (ATP) results also show superiority over other algorithm-specific and configurable designs, achieving improvement up to 82%, 63%, 79%, and 50% for Kyber, Dilithium, FALCON-512, and FALCON-1024, respectively. The SoC implementation results show that the NTT-based operations have improved by up to 5.29x, 27.49x, 56.79x, and 58.91x in software; and speed-up up to 10.53x, 9.81x, 9.57x, and 9.99x for the considered algorithms compared to previous SW/HW works on RISC-V platforms.

TI Correlations for computation and computation for correlations
SO NPJ QUANTUM INFORMATION
AB Quantum correlations are central to the foundations of quantum physics and form the basis of quantum technologies. Here, our goal is to connect quantum correlations and computation: using quantum correlations as a resource for computation-and vice versa, using computation to test quantum correlations. We derive Bell-type inequalities that test the capacity of quantum states for computing Boolean functions within a specific model of computation and experimentally investigate them using 4-photon Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) states. Furthermore, we show how the resource states can be used to specifically compute Boolean functions-which can be used to test and verify the non-classicality of the underlying quantum states. The connection between quantum correlation and computability shown here has applications in quantum technologies, and is important for networked computing being performed by measurements on distributed multipartite quantum states.

TI Optimisation-free density estimation and classification with quantum
   circuits
SO QUANTUM MACHINE INTELLIGENCE
AB We demonstrate the implementation of a novel machine learning framework for probability density estimation and classification using quantum circuits. The framework maps a training data set or a single data sample to the quantum state of a physical system through quantum feature maps. The quantum state of the arbitrarily large training data set summarises its probability distribution in a finite-dimensional quantum wave function. By projecting the quantum state of a new data sample onto the quantum state of the training data set, one can derive statistics to classify or estimate the density of the new data sample. Remarkably, the implementation of our framework on a real quantum device does not require any optimisation of quantum circuit parameters. Nonetheless, we discuss a variational quantum circuit approach that could leverage quantum advantage for our framework.

TI Experimental verification of on-chip quantum key distribution based on
   advantage distillation
SO ACTA PHYSICA SINICA
AB Quantum key distribution (QKD) has been extensively studied for practical applications. Advantage distillation (AD) represents a key technique to extract highly correlated bit pairs from weakly correlated ones, thus improving QKD protocol performance, particularly in large-error scenarios. However, its practical implementation remains under-explored. In this study, the AD is integrated into the three-intensity decoy-state BB84 protocol and its performance is demonstrated on a high-speed phase-encoding platform. The experimental system employs an asymmetric Mach-Zehnder interferometer (AMZI) fabricated on a silicon dioxide optical waveguide chip for phase encoding, which is benefited from its low coupling loss and minimum waveguide transmission loss. Phase-randomized weak coherent pulses, generated by a distributed feedback laser at 625 MHz, are modulated into decoy states of varying intensities. The signals are encoded via an AMZI and attenuated to single-photon levels before transmission. At the receiver, another AMZI demodulates the signals detected by avalanche photodiodes in gated mode. Experiments conducted at 50 km and 105 km demonstrate secure key rates of 104 kbits/s and 59 bits/s, respectively. The results at shorter distances closely match theoretical predictions, while slight deviations at 105 km are attributed to signal attenuation and noise. Despite these challenges, the results obtained at 105 km highlight the effectiveness of AD in enhancing secure key rates in the large-error scenario. This study confirms the potential of AD in extending secure communication range of QKD. By leveraging the high integration and scalability of silicon dioxide photonic chips, the proposed system lays a foundation for large-scale QKD deployment, paving the way for developing advanced protocols and real- world quantum networks.

TI Residual-ZZ-coupling suppression and fast two-qubit gate for
   Kerr-cat qubits based on level-degeneracy engineering
SO APPLIED PHYSICS LETTERS
AB Building large-scale quantum computers requires an interqubit-coupling scheme with a high on-off ratio to avoid unwanted crosstalk coming from residual coupling and to enable fast multi-qubit operations. We propose a ZZ-coupling scheme for two Kerr-cat qubits with a frequency-tunable coupler. By making four relevant states of the two Kerr-cat qubits quadruply degenerate, we can switch off the ZZ coupling. By partially lifting the level degeneracy, we can switch it on. We theoretically show that an experimentally feasible circuit model suppresses the residual ZZ coupling. Moreover, our circuit can realize RZZ(-pi/2)-gate fidelity higher than 99.9% within 18 ns when decoherence is ignored. Our model includes the first-order terms in expansion beyond the rotating-wave approximation.

The analytical expressions of the density operator and the entanglement can be obtained by using the dressed-state basis when the total excitation number is one. We also discuss in detail the effects of different parameters on the entanglement dynamics. The results show that the classical driving can not only protect the entanglement, but also effectively eliminate the influence of the qubit velocity and the detuning on the quantum entanglement.

TI Realizing coherently convertible dual-type qubits with the same ion
   species
SO NATURE PHYSICS
AB Trapped ions constitute one of the most promising systems for implementing quantum computing and networking(1,2). For large-scale ion-trap-based quantum computers and networks, it is critical to have two types of qubit: one for computation and storage, and another for auxiliary operations such as qubit detection(3), sympathetic cooling(4-7) and entanglement generation through photon links(8,9). Although the two qubit types can be implemented using two different ion species(3,10-13), this approach introduces substantial complexity into creating and controlling each qubit type(14,)(15). Here we resolve these challenges by implementing two coherently convertible qubit types using one ion species. We encode the qubits into two pairs of clock states of the Yb-171(+) ions, and achieve microsecond-level conversion rates between the two types with one-way fidelities of 99.5%. We further demonstrate that operations on one qubit type, including sympathetic laser cooling, single-qubit gates and qubit detection, have crosstalk errors less than 0.06% on the other type, which is below the best-known error threshold of similar to 1% for fault-tolerant quantum computing using the surface code(1,)(16). Our work establishes the feasibility and advantages of using coherently convertible dual-type qubits with the same ion species for large-scale quantum computing and networking.

TI Wave packet approach to quantum correlations in neutrino oscillations
SO EUROPEAN PHYSICAL JOURNAL C
AB Quantum correlations provide a fertile testing ground for investigating fundamental aspects of quantum physics in various systems, especially in the case of relativistic (elementary) particle systems as neutrinos. In a recent paper, Ming et al. (Eur Phys J C 80:275, 2020), in connection with results of Daya-Bay and MINOS experiments, have studied the quantumness in neutrino oscillations in the framework of plane-wave approximation. We extend their treatment by adopting the wave packet approach that accounts for effects due to localization and decoherence. This leads to a better agreement with experimental results, in particular for the case of MINOS experiment.

TI Error Mitigation for Universal Gates on Encoded Qubits
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB The Eastin-Knill theorem states that no quantum error-correcting code can have a universal set of transversal gates. For Calderbank-Shor-Steane codes that can implement Clifford gates transversally, it suffices to provide one additional non-Clifford gate, such as the T gate, to achieve universality. Common methods to implement fault-tolerant T gates, e.g., magic state distillation, generate a significant hardware overhead that will likely prevent their practical usage in the near-term future. Recently, methods have been developed to mitigate the effect of noise in shallow quantum circuits that are not protected by error correction. Error mitigation methods require no additional hardware resources but suffer from a bad asymptotic scaling and apply only to a restricted class of quantum algorithms. In this Letter, we combine both approaches and show how to implement encoded Clifford + T circuits where Clifford gates are protected from noise by error correction while errors introduced by noisy encoded T gates are mitigated using the quasiprobability method. As a result, Clifford + T circuits with a number of T gates inversely proportional to the physical noise rate can be implemented on small error-corrected devices without magic state distillation. We argue that such circuits can be out of reach for state-of-the-art classical simulation algorithms.

TI Time-varying quantum channel models for superconducting qubits
SO NPJ QUANTUM INFORMATION
AB The decoherence effects experienced by the qubits of a quantum processor are generally characterized using the amplitude damping time (T-1) and the dephasing time (T-2). Quantum channel models that exist at the time of writing assume that these parameters are fixed and invariant. However, recent experimental studies have shown that they exhibit a time-varying (TV) behaviour. These time-dependant fluctuations of T-1 and T-2, which become even more pronounced in the case of superconducting qubits, imply that conventional static quantum channel models do not capture the noise dynamics experienced by realistic qubits with sufficient precision. In this article, we study how the fluctuations of T-1 and T-2 can be included in quantum channel models. We propose the idea of time-varying quantum channel (TVQC) models, and we show how they provide a more realistic portrayal of decoherence effects than static models in some instances. We also discuss the divergence that exists between TVQCs and their static counterparts by means of a metric known as the diamond norm. In many circumstances this divergence can be significant, which indicates that the time-dependent nature of decoherence must be considered, in order to construct models that capture the real nature of quantum devices.

TI A bright future for silicon in quantum technologies
SO JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYSICS
AB Silicon is the most widely used material in microelectronic devices; integration of atomic impurities in silicon via doping during growth or ion implant is now widely used as it allows to form conventional transistors. Exploiting all the knowledge accumulated over the last 60 years in the context of the second quantum revolution that is now underway would help accelerate the commercialization of quantum technologies. Several works have already reported that silicon can be an optically active material with point-like defects emitting below the Si bandgap, both in ensemble emission and absorption in natural Si as well as in isotopically purified 28Si, even under electrical pumping. Very recently, the detection of individual impurities in silicon opened the door for further exploitation of this indirect bandgap material to applications in quantum technologies, including single photon emission at near-infrared frequency, matching the telecommunication band and optical detection of individual spins. Here, we describe the current state-of-the-art and discuss the forthcoming challenges and goals toward a reliable exploitation of these solid-state quantum-emitters in the context of quantum technologies. In particular, we examine opportunities, issues, and challenges in controlling defect formation and localization, extrinsic effects, and integration of optical devices.

TI Enumerating all bilocal Clifford distillation protocols through symmetry
   reduction
SO QUANTUM
AB Entanglement distillation is an essential building block in quantum communication protocols. Here, we study the class of near-term implementable distillation protocols that use bilocal Clifford operations followed by a single round of communication. We introduce tools to enumerate and optimise over all protocols for up to n = 5 (not necessarily equal) Bell-diagonal states using a commodity desktop computer. Furthermore, by exploiting the symmetries of the input states, we find all protocols for up to n = 8 copies of a Werner state. For the latter case, we present circuits that achieve the highest fidelity with perfect operations and no decoherence. These circuits have modest depth and number of two-qubit gates. Our results are based on a correspondence between distillation protocols and double cosets of the symplectic group, and improve on previously known protocols.

TI Approximating dynamical correlation functions with constant depth
   quantum circuits
SO QUANTUM
AB One of the most important quantities characterizing the microscopic properties of quantum systems are dynamical correlation functions. These correlations are obtained by time-evolving a perturbation of an eigenstate of the system, typically the ground state. In this work, we study approximations of these correlation functions that do not require time dynamics. We show that having access to a circuit that prepares an eigenstate of the Hamiltonian, it is possible to approximate the dynamical correlation functions up to exponential accuracy in the complex frequency domain w = Re(w) + i Im(w), on a strip above the real line Im(w) = 0. We achieve this by exploiting the continued fraction representation of the dynamical correlation functions as functions of frequency w, where the level k approximant can be obtained by measuring a weight O(k) operator on the eigenstate of interest. In the complex w plane, we show how this approach allows to determine approximations to correlation functions with accuracy that increases exponentially with k. We analyse two algorithms to generate the continuous fraction representation in scalar or matrix form, starting from either one or many initial operators. We prove that these algorithms generate an exponentially accurate approximation of the dynamical correlation functions on a region sufficiently far away from the real frequency axis. We present numerical evidence of these theoretical results through simulations of small lattice systems. We comment on the stability of these algorithms with respect to sampling noise in the context of quantum simulation using quantum computers.

TI Quantum Computing-Based Search Method for Transmission Sections
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB The increasing scale and complexity of modern power systems impose higher demands for the secure and stable operation of power grids. Traditional methods for identifying key transmission section (KTS) suffer from limitations such as low computational efficiency and high risk of missing critical sections. Quantum computing possesses unparalleled parallel processing capabilities that classical computing technologies cannot match, offering a groundbreaking technical approach to transmission section (TS) search. This paper proposes KTS identification method based on the quantum approximate optimization algorithm (QAOA). By constructing target and initial Hamiltonians from topological cut-sets, a quantum circuit model is designed. Quantum parameters are then optimized via differential gradient descent and expected cut value tuning, facilitating efficient TS search. The KTS is determined by integrating electrical zone connectivity and power flow distribution factor thresholds, ensuring the physical rationality and security sensitivity of the results. Experiments on the Origin Quantum Qpanda software platform using the IEEE 14-node system and IEEE 30-node system demonstrate that the proposed method significantly improves the identification rate of KTS.

TI Applications of universal parity quantum computation
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB We demonstrate the applicability of a universal gate set in the parity encoding, which is a dual to the standard gate model, by exploring several quantum gate algorithms such as the quantum Fourier transform and quantum addition. Embedding these algorithms in the parity encoding reduces the circuit depth compared to conventional gate-based implementations while keeping the multiqubit gate counts comparable. We further propose simple implementations of multiqubit gates in tailored encodings and an efficient strategy to prepare graph states.

TI Developing a Grover's quantum algorithm emulator on standalone FPGAs:
   optimization and implementation
SO AIMS MATHEMATICS
AB Quantum computing (QC) leverages superposition, entanglement, and parallelism to solve complex problems that are challenging for classical computing methods. The immense potential of QC has spurred explosive interest and research in both academia and industry. However, the practicality of QC based on large-scale quantum computers remains limited by issues of scalability and error correction. To bridge this gap, QC emulators utilizing classical computing resources have emerged, with modern implementations employing FPGAs for efficiency. Nevertheless, FPGA-based QC emulators face significant limitations, particularly in standalone implementations required for low- power, low-performance devices like IoT end nodes, embedded systems, and wearable devices, due to their substantial resource demands. This paper proposes optimization techniques to reduce resource requirements and enable standalone FPGA implementations of QC emulators. We specifically focused on Grover's algorithm, known for its excellent performance in searching unstructured databases. The proposed resource-saving optimization techniques allow for the emulation of the largest possible Grover's algorithm within the constrained resources of FPGAs. Using these optimization techniques, we developed a hardware accelerator for Grover's algorithm and integrated it with a RISC-V processor architecture. We completed a standalone Grover's algorithm-specific emulator operating on FPGAs, demonstrating significant performance enhancements and resource savings afforded by the proposed techniques.

TI Quantifying unknown entanglement by neural networks
SO QUANTUM INFORMATION PROCESSING
AB Quantum entanglement plays a crucial role in quantum information processing tasks and quantum mechanics; hence, quantifying unknown entanglement is a fundamental task. However, this is also challenging, as entanglement cannot be measured by any observables directly. In this paper, we train neural networks to quantify unknown entanglement, where the input features for neural networks are the outcome statistics data produced by measuring target quantum states with local or even single-qubit Pauli observables, and the training labels are well-chosen quantities. For bipartite quantum states, this quantity is coherent information, which is a lower bound for many popular entanglement measures, like the entanglement of distillation. For multipartite quantum states, we choose this quantity as the geometric measure of entanglement. It turns out that the neural networks we train have very good performance in quantifying unknown quantum entanglement and can beat previous approaches like semi-device-independent protocols for this problem easily in both precision and application range. We also observe an interesting phenomenon that on quantum states with stronger quantum nonlocality, the neural networks tend to have better performance, though we do not provide them any knowledge on quantum nonlocality.

TI IMPLEMENTING THREE-QUBIT GROVER'S ALGORITHM USING REAL QUANTUM PLATFORMS
SO FRACTALS-COMPLEX GEOMETRY PATTERNS AND SCALING IN NATURE AND SOCIETY
AB Quantum computing is an innovative field that has opened up a whole new world of computational possibilities. At the forefront of this field is Grover's algorithm, a pioneering algorithm that has the remarkable ability to search an unsorted database quadratically faster than its classical counterparts. It harnesses the power of quantum mechanics, specifically quantum superposition and quantum parallelism, to explore a vast solution space simultaneously. In this work, we present an overview of Grover's algorithm, highlighting its key principles and proposing an implementation using fermionic quantum computing and a structured linear optics circuit in other cases. The approaches are technologically different, but both can implement Grover's algorithm. Our work aims to compare the two approaches, highlight their advantages and disadvantages, and tries to conclude which one is the most promising for practical implementation. The former presented the advantage of having a simpler circuit schematization and excellent scalability. Thanks to the use of the quantum properties of fermions, an essential feature of the algorithm, entanglement can be easily achieved. The most evident disadvantage that was found is a lower probability of success than the theoretical one, due to a non-negligible decoherence of the quantum state due to the strong interaction with the environment by the fermions. The second has the advantage of being more flexible and easier to implement, as it is based on a more traditional and well-established approach - quantum linear optics, where bosons interact weakly with matter, and therefore, the phenomenon of decoherence is negligible. The disadvantage lies in the excessive difficulty of achieving entanglement without using nonlinear optical subcircuits or ancillary quantum modes, and it has a low degree of scalability.

AB As quantum networking experiments move from laboratory experiments to larger scale deployments, integrated control software becomes essential for managing complex interactions between the numerous distributed resources involved. While a number of laboratory-scale control systems have been developed for specific quantum platform demonstrations, an openly available and general solution for operating quantum networks has not emerged. With the QUANT-NET Control Plane (QNCP), we introduce a model-based, extensible control plane implementation that offers a framework for enabling network-wide orchestration in quantum information network environments. QCNP provides a quantum network data model, resource management, communication primitives, and a plugin interface for defining orchestration and protocol interactions across distributed quantum network devices and services. This paper describes the design and architecture of QNCP, its implementation, and opportunities for extensibility and deployment.

TI High-fidelity trapped-ion qubit operations with scalable photonic
   modulators
SO NPJ QUANTUM INFORMATION
AB Experiments with trapped ions and neutral atoms typically employ optical modulators in order to control the phase, frequency, and amplitude of light directed to individual atoms. These elements are expensive, bulky, consume substantial power, and often rely on free-space I/O channels, all of which pose scaling challenges. To support many-ion systems like trapped-ion quantum computers or miniaturized deployable devices like clocks and sensors, these elements must ultimately be microfabricated, ideally monolithically with the trap to avoid losses associated with optical coupling between physically separate components. In this work we design, fabricate, and test an optical modulator capable of monolithic integration with a surface-electrode ion trap. These devices consist of piezo-optomechanical photonic integrated circuits configured as multi-stage Mach-Zehnder modulators that are used to control the intensity of light delivered to a single trapped ion on a separate chip. We use quantum tomography employing hundreds of multi-gate sequences to enhance the sensitivity of the fidelity to the types and magnitudes of gate errors relevant to quantum computing and better characterize the performance of the modulators, ultimately measuring single qubit gate fidelities that exceed 99.7%.

TI Quantum one-time tables for unconditionally secure qubit-commitment
SO QUANTUM
AB The commodity-based cryptography is an alternative approach to realize conventionally impossible cryptographic primitives such as unconditionally secure bit-commitment by consuming pre-established correlation between distrustful participants. A unit of such classical correlation is known as the one-time table (OTT). In this paper, we introduce a new example besides quantum key distribution in which quantum correlation is useful for cryptography. We propose a scheme for unconditionally secure qubit-commitment, a quantum cryptographic primitive forbidden by the recently proven no-masking theorem in the standard model, based on the consumption of the quantum generalization of the OTT, the bipartite quantum state we named quantum one-time tables (QOTT). The construction of the QOTT is based on the newly analyzed internal structure of quantum masker and the quantum secret sharing schemes. Our qubit-commitment scheme is shown to be universally cornposable. We propose to measure the randomness cost of preparing a (Q)OTT in terms of its entropy, and show that the QOTT with superdense coding can increase the security level with half the cost of OTTs for unconditionally secure bit-commitment. The QOTT exemplifies an operational setting where neither maximally classically correlated state nor maximally entangled state, but rather a well-structured partially entangled mixed state is more valuable resource.

TI Learning to classify quantum phases of matter with a few measurements
SO QUANTUM SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB We study the identification of quantum phases of matter, at zero temperature, when only part of the phase diagram is known in advance. Following a supervised learning approach, we show how to use our previous knowledge to construct an observable capable of classifying the phase even in the unknown region. By using a combination of classical and quantum techniques, such as tensor networks, kernel methods, generalization bounds, quantum algorithms, and shadow estimators, we show that, in some cases, the certification of new ground states can be obtained with a polynomial number of measurements. An important application of our findings is the classification of the phases of matter obtained in quantum simulators, e.g. cold atom experiments, capable of efficiently preparing ground states of complex many-particle systems and applying simple measurements, e.g. single qubit measurements, but unable to perform a universal set of gates.

TI Qubit-efficient encoding scheme for quantum simulations of electronic
   structure
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Simulating electronic structure on a quantum computer requires encoding of fermionic systems onto qubits. Common encoding methods transform a fermionic system of N spin-orbitals into an N-qubit system, but many of the fermionic configurations do not respect the required conditions and symmetries of the system so the qubit Hilbert space in this case may have unphysical states and thus cannot be fully utilized. We propose a generalized qubit-efficient encoding (QEE) scheme that requires the qubit number to be only logarithmic in the number of configurations that satisfy the required conditions and symmetries. For the case of considering only the particle-conserving and singlet configurations, we reduce the qubit count to an upper bound of O(m log(2) N), where m is the number of particles. This QEE scheme is demonstrated on an H-2 molecule in the 6-31G basis set and a LiH molecule in the STO-3G basis set using fewer qubits than the common encoding methods. We calculate the ground-state energy surfaces using a variational quantum eigensolver algorithm with a hardware-efficient ansatz circuit. We choose to use a hardware-efficient ansatz since most of the Hilbert space in our scheme is spanned by desired configurations so a heuristic search for an eigenstate is sensible. The simulations are performed on IBM Quantum machines and the Qiskit simulator with a noise model implemented from a IBM Quantum machine. Using the methods of measurement error mitigation and error-free linear extrapolation, we demonstrate that most of the distributions of the extrapolated energies using our QEE scheme agree with the exact results obtained by Hamiltonian diagonalization in the given basis sets within chemical accuracy. Our proposed scheme and results show the feasibility of quantum simulations for larger molecular systems in the noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) era. The number of terms in the Hamiltonian has an upper bound of of O(N2m+1/(m-1)!m!) for the QEE scheme while it scales as O(N-4) for the Jordan-Wigner encoding scheme. Nevertheless, we present several cases where QEE is useful.

SO REVIEW OF SCIENTIFIC INSTRUMENTS
AB Electronic systems for qubit control and measurement serve as a bridge between quantum programming language and quantum information processors. With the rapid development of superconducting quantum circuit technology, synchronization in a large-scale system, low-latency execution, and low noise are required for electronic systems. Here, we present a field-programmable gate array (FPGA)-based electronic system with a distributed synchronous clock and trigger architecture. The system supports synchronous control of qubits with jitters of similar to 5 ps. We implement a real-time digital signal processing system in the FPGA, enabling precise timing control, arbitrary waveform generation, in-phase and quadrature demodulation for qubit state discrimination, and the generation of real-time qubit-state-dependent trigger signals for feedback/feedforward control. The hardware and firmware low-latency design reduces the feedback/feedforward latency of the electronic system to 125 ns, significantly less than the decoherence times of the qubit. Finally, we demonstrate the functionalities and low-noise performance of this system using a fluxonium quantum processor. Published under an exclusive license by AIP Publishing.

TI The generation of genuine quadripartite Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen steering
   in an optical superlattice
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR) steering is a quantum effect based on quantum entanglement and it is the key resource for building quantum networks because of its useful properties. Based on the criterion for genuine multipartite EPR steering, the genuine quadripartite EPR steering is confirmed and it can be generated by a spontaneous parametric down-conversion cascaded process with two sum-frequency generations in an optical superlattice. This occurs either below the oscillation threshold and without oscillation threshold. The influence of the parameters of cascaded nonlinear process on the quadripartite EPR steering among signal, idler, and two sum-frequency beams are also discussed. Choosing appropriate nonlinear parameters can achieve good quadripartite quantum steering. This scheme of the generation of genuine quadripartite EPR steering has potential applications in quantum communication and computing.

TI Multipartite entanglement distribution in a topological photonic network
SO QUANTUM
AB In the ongoing effort towards a scalable quantum computer, multiple technologies have been proposed. Some of them exploit topological materials to process quantum information. In this work, we propose a lattice of photonic cavities with alternating hoppings to create a modified multidomain SSH chain, that is, a sequence of topological insulators made from chains of dimers. A qubit is then coupled to each boundary. We show this system is well suited for quantum information processing because topological transfer of photons through this one-dimensional lattice can entangle any set of qubits on demand, providing a scalable quantum platform. We verify this claim evaluating entanglement measures and witnesses, proving that bipartite and multipartite entanglement is produced, even in the presence of some disorder.

TI QUANTUM CORRELATIONS IN THE HADRONIZATION PROCESS
SO ACTA PHYSICA POLONICA B PROCEEDINGS SUPPLEMENT
CT 31st Cracow Epiphany Conference on the Recent LHC Results
CY JAN 13-17, 2025
CL Cracow, POLAND
AB The quantum interference effects have been studied across many collision systems with a wide spectrum of energies and particle species. They were the subject of studies in many experiments using different accelerators. Studying the quantum correlations may provide essential information to understand the mechanism of hadronization, describing in particular the space-time structure of the hadronization source. As the measured correlation parameters depend on various observables, such as charged particle multiplicity, transverse momentum, or hadron mass, it is essential to model the observed trends properly. In particular, it was observed that the correlation radii become smaller with an increasing mass of the studied hadron species, which was a conclusion driven mainly by the LEP measurements performed for a number of different types of hadrons. One of the approaches aiming at interpretation of the observed dependence of the correlation radius on the hadron mass is the quantum-mechanical model employing the Bj & ouml;rken-Gottfried condition, suggesting the universality of the source radius, which is independent of the hadron mass.

TI A scheme for direct detection of qubit-environment entanglement
   generated during qubit pure dephasing
SO QUANTUM INFORMATION PROCESSING
AB We propose a scheme for the detection of qubit-environment entanglement which requires only operations and measurements on the qubit, all within reach of current experimental state-of-the-art. The scheme works for any type of interaction which leads to pure dephasing of the qubit as long as the initial qubit state is pure. The scheme is direct in the sense that it allows the detection of entanglement present in the system at time tau after the initialization of the qubit in a superposition state. It requires a measurement on the qubit at time tau and a comparison of the post-measurement evolution to the evolution obtained by a modified scheme. It becomes particularly simple when one of the qubit states is neutral with respect to the environment, such as in case of the most common choice of the NV center spin qubit or for excitonic charge qubits, when the environment is initially at thermal equilibrium. In this case, the post-measurement evolution needs to be compared only to the standard decoherence which is obtained without any qubit manipulation after the preparation of the initial state.

TI Quantum Receivers for Entanglement Assisted Classical Optical
   Communications
SO IEEE PHOTONICS JOURNAL
AB Entanglement assisted (EA) communication represents an interesting alternative to classical communication, in particular in low-brightness and highly noisy regime when it outperforms significantly corresponding classical counterpart in terms of the channel capacity. Even though that the EA capacity is known for decades the optimum quantum receiver has not been determined yet. In this paper, we propose several low-complexity quantum receivers outperforming recently proposed receivers employing the optical parametric amplifier as a basic building block. We demonstrate by simulations that the capacity of the proposed EA schemes, employing Gaussian modulation and the proposed low-complexity joint receivers, can significantly outperform both the Holevo capacity and classical homodyne and heterodyne channel capacities.

TI Discrete-variable quantum key distribution services hosted in legacy
   passive optical networks [Invited]
SO JOURNAL OF OPTICAL COMMUNICATIONS AND NETWORKING
AB Fiber-based quantum key distribution (QKD) systems are mature and commercialized, but their integration into existing optical networks is crucial for their widespread use, in particular in passive optical networks (PONs) if end-to-end quantum-secured communications are to be addressed. While discrete-variable QKD coexistence with classical channels is well-studied in point-to-point links, its performance in point-to-multipoint topologies like PONs has received less attention. We thus developed a numerical tool to estimate quantum-available bandwidth and maximum link lengths for QKD systems in single-fiber PON architectures in coexistence with GPON, XG-PON, NG-PON2, and HS-PON standards. The QKD channel performance is obtained by setting thresholds on the quantum bit error rate and the secret key rate, ultimately limited by spontaneous Raman scattering noise and high optical distribution network losses. We perform a comparison between the performance obtained assuming the asymptotic infinite-key generation rate or taking into account actual implementations in the finite-key regime. We evidence that proper design rules can be obtained as a function of both classical and quantum system parameters to support end-to-end quantum security services in existing optical networks.

TI Programmable N-Body Interactions with Trapped Ions
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB Trapped atomic ion qubits or effective spins are a powerful quantum platform for quantum computation and simulation, featuring densely connected and efficiently programmable interactions between the spins. While native interactions between trapped-ion spins are typically pairwise, many quantum algorithms and quantum spin models naturally feature couplings between triplets, quartets, or higher orders of spins. Here, we formulate and analyze a mechanism that extends the standard Molmer-Sorensen pairwise entangling gate and generates a controllable and programmable coupling between N spins of trapped ions. We show that spin-dependent optical parametric drives applied at twice the motional frequency generate a coordinate transformation of the collective ion motion in phase space, rendering displacement forces that are nonlinear in the spin operators. We formulate a simple framework that enables a systematic and faithful construction of high-order spin Hamiltonians and gates, including the effect of multiple modes of motion, and characterize the performance of such operations under realistic conditions.

TI Demonstrating BB84 Quantum Key Distribution in the Physical Layer of an
   Optical Fiber Based System
SO INFOCOMMUNICATIONS JOURNAL
AB Nowadays, widely spread encryption methods (e.g., RSA) and protocols enabling digital signatures (e.g., DSA, ECDSA) are an integral part of our life. Although recently developed quantum computers have low processing capacity, huge dimensions and lack of interoperability, we must underline their practical significance applying Peter Shor's quantum algorithm (which makes it possible to factorize integers in polynomial time) public key cryptography is set to become breakable. As an answer, symmetric key cryptography proves to be secure against quantum based attacks and with it quantum key distribution (QKD) is going through vast development and growing to be a hot topic in data security. This is due to such methods securely generating symmetric keys by protocols relying on laws of quantum physics.
   In this paper we introduce a fiber based QKD system that is being built in Hungary in a collaboration between Budapest University of Technology and Economics (BME), Wigner Research Centre for Physics and Ericsson Hungary. We demonstrate the first successful quantum key distribution over physical layer in accordance with the truth table of BB84 protocol in the country. We apply light pulses at 1550 nm wavelength, reducing their power to less than one photon per pulse level. We create two phases of operation including an initialization phase in which software and hardware solutions are proposed for synchronizing the units of the two communicating parties. We introduce a data processing and a timing mechanism and elaborate on the results of the demonstration. We also inspect the possibilities of efficiency enhancement and give an outlook on further development directions.

TI Effect of Marine Bubbles on the Performance of Underwater Quantum
   Communication Channel
SO ACTA OPTICA SINICA
AB Objective In recent years, quantum communication has become a research hotspot in China and abroad for its better data transmission security. As the core of the quantum information theory, quantum communication can be more secure and reliable for information transmission and is an important direction of inquiry. With the development of underwater wireless communication, it is important to research underwater quantum communication for marine and military fields. Bubbles are ubiquitous in the ocean, and the scattering and refraction effects of bubbles on light can cause certain losses in optical quantum transmission, which exerts a certain impact on the performance of underwater optical quantum communication. However, the research on the effect of bubbles on the channel performance of underwater quantum communication has not been conducted. By building the particle size distribution and scattering coefficient models of marine bubbles, the paper analyzes the effects of different condition parameters on link attenuation, entanglement, channel capacity, and channel bit error rate (BER) in the marine bubble environment to investigate the influence of these bubbles on the channel performance of underwater quantum communication. This is of great significance to improve the efficiency of underwater quantum communication.
   Methods Marine bubbles are mainly generated by wind-driven wave breaking. With an aim to study the influence of marine bubbles on the channel performance of underwater quantum communication, the particle size distribution function of the bubbles is firstly derived and established. The scattering characteristics and extinction coefficient of the bubbles are studied according to the particle size distribution model of marine bubbles. Additionally, according to the extinction characteristics, the relationship between marine bubble parameters and link attenuation is firstly established, and then the effects of different depths and bubble radii on channel entanglement are analyzed. Then, the effects of different bubble concentrations and transmission distances on three channel capacities of amplitude damped channel, depolarized channel, and bit-flip channel are analyzed respectively. Finally, the effects of different bubble concentrations and transmission distances on channel BER are studied and analyzed. At the same time, the effects of different bubble concentrations and transmission distances on the channel BER are studied and simulated. The theoretical analysis and simulation results can provide a reference for the design of underwater quantum communication in the marine bubble environment.
   Results and Discussions The simulation results show that the density of bubbles decreases with the increasing depth from the sea level, whereas increases with the rising wind speed. The scattering coefficient of bubbles has the same trend as the bubble density number under the same parameter conditions. Under short transmission distance and small bubble concentration, the link attenuation caused by marine bubbles is also small. With the increase in the transmission distance of optical quantum signals and the bubble concentration, the link attenuation grows rapidly. The channel entanglement increases with the rising depth from the sea level and the decreasing bubble radius. For the amplitude damping channel, depolarization channel, and bit-flip channel, the channel capacity decreases to different degrees with the increasing transmission distance and bubble concentration. The capacity of the depolarization channel and the bit-flip channel is more affected by the transmission distance, and the transmission distance exerts less effect on the channel capacity. The BER in the marine bubble environment is also affected by the transmission distance and bubble concentration. When the bubble concentration is small with a short transmission distance, the system BER changes slowly. When the bubble concentration is large with a long transmission distance, the optical quantum signal attenuates seriously and the BER value rises rapidly.
   Conclusions To investigate the effect of marine bubbles on the channel performance of underwater quantum communication, this paper studies the scattering characteristics of the bubbles according to the particle size distribution model of marine bubbles. In addition, the effects of different condition parameters on link attenuation, entanglement, channel capacity, and channel BER are analyzed according to the extinction coefficient of bubbles, and simulation experiments are conducted. The results show that the increase in bubble concentration and transmission distance increases the link attenuation and BER, and the channel capacity decreases for amplitude damping channel, depolarization channel, and bit-flip channel. The channel entanglement decreases with the increasing bubble radius and decreasing depth, and the impact of marine bubbles on communication performance cannot be ignored. Meanwhile, parameters related to underwater quantum communication should be adjusted appropriately according to the concentration of marine bubbles to reduce the impact of the marine bubble environment on the communication system and improve the reliability of the communication system in practical application.

TI Mitigation of channel tampering attacks in continuous-variable quantum
   key distribution
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Despite significant advancements in continuous-variable quantum key distribution (CV-QKD), practical CV-QKD systems can be compromised by various attacks. Consequently, identifying new attack vectors and countermeasures for CV-QKD implementations is important for the continued robustness of CV-QKD. In particular, as CV-QKD relies on a public quantum channel, vulnerability to communication disruption persists from potential adversaries employing denial-of-service (DoS) attacks. Inspired by DoS attacks, this paper introduces a threat in CV-QKD called the channel amplification (CA) attack, wherein Eve manipulates the communication channel through amplification. We specifically model this attack in a CV-QKD optical fiber setup. To counter this threat, we propose a detection and mitigation strategy. Detection involves a machine learning (ML) model based on a decision tree classifier, classifying various channel tampering attacks, including CA and DoS attacks. For mitigation, Bob, postselects quadrature data by classifying the attack type and frequency. Our ML model exhibits high accuracy in distinguishing and categorizing these attacks. The CA attack's impact on the secret key rate (SKR) is explored concerning Eve's location and the relative intensity noise of the local oscillator (LO). The proposed mitigation strategy improves the attacked SKR for CA attacks and, in some cases, for hybrid CA-DoS attacks. Our study marks an application of both ML classification and postselection in this context. These findings are important for enhancing the robustness of CV-QKD systems against emerging threats on the channel.

TI Measurement-Based Quantum Computation in Symmetry-Enriched Topological
   Phases
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB We present the first examples of topological phases of matter with uniform power for measurementbased quantum computation (MBQC). This is possible due to a new framework for analyzing the computational properties of phases of matter that is more general than previous constructions, which have been limited to short-range entangled phases in one dimension. We show that ground states of the toric code in an anisotropic magnetic field yield a natural, albeit noncomputationally universal, application of our framework. We then present a new model with topological order the ground states of which are universal resources for MBQC. Both topological models are enriched by subsystem symmetries and these symmetries protect their computational power. Our framework greatly expands the range of physical models that can be analyzed from the computational perspective.

TI Bound states in the continuum in a fluxonium qutrit
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Heavy fluxonium at zero external flux has a long-lived state when coupled capacitively to any other system. We analyze it by projecting all the fluxonium-relevant operators into the qutrit subspace, as this long-lived configuration corresponds to the second excited fluxonium level. This state becomes a bound state in the continuum (BIC) when the coupling occurs to an extended system supporting a continuum of modes. In the case without noise, we find BIC lifetimes T1 that can be much larger than seconds when the fluxonium is coupled to a superconducting waveguide, while typical device frequencies are on the order of gigahertz. We have performed a detailed study of the different sources of decoherence in a realistic experiment, finding that upwards transitions caused by a finite temperature in the waveguide and decay induced by 1/f flux noise are the most dangerous ones. Even in their presence, BIC decay times could reach the range of T1 ti 10-1 ms, while preparation times are of the order of 102 ns.

TI Universality of Z3 parafermions via edge-mode interaction and quantum
   simulation of topological space evolution with Rydberg atoms
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Parafermions are Zn generalizations of Majorana quasiparticles, with fractional non-Abelian statistics. They can be used to encode topological qudits and perform Clifford operations by their braiding. Here we investigate the generation of quantum gates by allowing Z3 parafermions to interact in order to achieve universality. In particular, we study the form of the nontopological gate that arises through direct short-range interaction of the parafermion edge modes in a Z3 parafermion chain. We show that such an interaction gives rise to a dynamical phase gate on the encoded ground space, generating a non-Clifford gate which can be tuned to belong to even levels of the Clifford hierarchy. We illustrate how to access highly noncontextual states using this dynamical gate. Finally, we propose an experiment that simulates the braiding and dynamical evolutions of the Z3 topological states with Rydberg atom technology.

AB Quantum Computing is an emerging paradigm which is gathering a lot of popularity in the current scientific and technological community. Widely conceived as the next frontier of computation, Quantum Computing is still at the dawn of its development. Thus, current solving systems suffer from significant limitations in terms of performance and capabilities. Some interesting approaches have been devised by researchers and practitioners in order to overcome these barriers, being quantum-classical hybrid algorithms one of the most often used solving schemes. The main goal of this paper is to extend the results and findings of the recently proposed hybrid Quantum Computing - Tabu Search Algorithm for partitioning problems. To do that, we focus our research on the adaptation of this method to the Asymmetric Traveling Salesman Problem. In overall, we have employed six well-known instances belonging to TSPLIB to assess the performance of Quantum Computing - Tabu Search Algorithm in comparison to QBSolv. Furthermore, as an additional contribution, this work also supposes the first solving of the Asymmetric Traveling Salesman Problem using a Quantum Computing based method. Aiming to boost whole community's research in QC, we have released the project's repository as open source code for further application and improvements.

TI Analytical solution for nonadiabatic quantum annealing to arbitrary
   Ising spin Hamiltonian
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB The computational capabilities of quantum annealing in the accessible regimes of operation are still subject to debate. Here, the authors study a model admitting an analytical solution far from the adiabatic regime, and show evidences of better convergence and energy relaxation rates over classical annealing.
   Ising spin Hamiltonians are often used to encode a computational problem in their ground states. Quantum Annealing (QA) computing searches for such a state by implementing a slow time-dependent evolution from an easy-to-prepare initial state to a low energy state of a target Ising Hamiltonian of quantum spins, H-I. Here, we point to the existence of an analytical solution for such a problem for an arbitrary H-I beyond the adiabatic limit for QA. This solution provides insights into the accuracy of nonadiabatic computations. Our QA protocol in the pseudo-adiabatic regime leads to a monotonic power-law suppression of nonadiabatic excitations with time T of QA, without any signature of a transition to a glass phase, which is usually characterized by a logarithmic energy relaxation. This behavior suggests that the energy relaxation can differ in classical and quantum spin glasses strongly, when it is assisted by external time-dependent fields. In specific cases of H-I, the solution also shows a considerable quantum speedup in computations.

TI Verifying the security of a continuous variable quantum communication
   protocol via quantum metrology
SO NPJ QUANTUM INFORMATION
AB Quantum mechanics offers the possibility of unconditionally secure communication between multiple remote parties. Security proofs for such protocols typically rely on bounding the capacity of the quantum channel in use. In a similar manner, Cramer-Rao bounds in quantum metrology place limits on how much information can be extracted from a given quantum state about some unknown parameters of interest. In this work we establish a connection between these two areas. We first demonstrate a three-party sensing protocol, where the attainable precision is dependent on how many parties work together. This protocol is then mapped to a secure access protocol, where only by working together can the parties gain access to some high security asset. Finally, we map the same task to a communication protocol where we demonstrate that a higher mutual information can be achieved when the parties work collaboratively compared to any party working in isolation.

TI LEAP: Scaling Numerical Optimization Based Synthesis Using an
   Incremental Approach

AB While showing great promise, circuit synthesis techniques that combine numerical optimization with search over circuit structures face scalability challenges due to a large number of parameters, exponential search spaces, and complex objective functions. The LEAP algorithm improves scaling across these dimensions using iterative circuit synthesis, incremental reoptimization, dimensionality reduction, and improved numerical optimization. LEAP draws on the design of the optimal synthesis algorithm QSearch by extending it with an incremental approach to determine constant prefix solutions for a circuit. By narrowing the search space, LEAP improves scalability from four to six qubit circuits. LEAP was evaluated with known quantum circuits such as QFT and physical simulation circuits like the VQE, TFIM, and QITE. LEAP can compile four qubit unitaries up to 59x faster than QSearch and five and six qubit unitaries with up to 1.2x fewer CNOTs compared to the QFAST package. LEAP can reduce the CNOT count by up to 36x, or 7x on average, compared to the CQC Tket compiler. Despite its heuristics, LEAP has generated optimal circuits for many test cases with a priori known solutions. The techniques introduced by LEAP are applicable to other numerical optimization based synthesis approaches.

TI Exploring Single-Molecular Magnets for Quantum Technologies
SO MOLECULES
AB A single-molecule magnet (SMM) is a molecule that functions as a magnet. SMMs can be explored not only for emerging technology but also the fundamental science of their quantum nature, nanometer sizes, and their ease of engineering. This review encompasses the state-of-the-art experiments and theories developed so far for SMMs. We briefly explore their experimental synthesis and characterization. In the experimental synthesis, we cover 'Click Chemistry' and supramolecular chemistry. The main experimental characterizations comprise superconducting quantum interference devices, electron paramagnetic resonance, neutron scattering, and X-ray magnetic circular dichroism. The theoretical and computational works based on the density functional theory, the post-Hartree-Fock methods, and the theory of open quantum systems are discussed. Moreover, we exemplify the numerous promising research areas for SMMs by discussing quantum technologies. We envision a brilliant future for the fundamental research and emerging applications of SMMs.

TI Ladder of Loschmidt anomalies in the deep strong-coupling regime of a
   qubit-oscillator system
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB We uncover a remarkably regular array of singularitylike structures within the deep strong-coupling limit of qubit-oscillator (e.g., light-matter) systems described by the quantum Rabi model as a function of time and coupling strength. These nonanalytic anomalies in the Loschmidt amplitude (echoes) suggest the existence of new forms of dynamical phase transition within this deep strong-coupling regime. The key feature whereby the initial state collapses into orthogonal states at select values of the interaction strength and select times may be used to enhance-or attack-quantum information processing or computation schemes that rely on removing- or retaining-a given quantum state.

TI Quantum algorithms for numerical differentiation of expected values with
   respect to parameters
SO QUANTUM INFORMATION PROCESSING
AB The quantum algorithms for Monte Carlo integration (QMCI), which are based on quantum amplitude estimation (QAE), speed up expected value calculation compared with classical counterparts and have been widely investigated along with their applications to industrial problems such as financial derivative pricing. In this paper, we consider an expected value of a function of a stochastic variable and a real-valued parameter and how to calculate derivatives of the expectation with respect to the parameter. This problem is related to calculating sensitivities of financial derivatives and so of industrial importance. Based on QMCI and the general-order central difference formula for numerical differentiation, we propose two quantum methods for this problem and evaluate their complexities. The first one, which we call the naive iteration method, simply calculates the formula by iterative computations and additions of the terms in it and then estimates its expected value by QAE. The second one, which we name the sum-in-QAE method, performs the summation of the terms at the same time as the sum over the possible values of the stochastic variable in a single QAE. We see that, depending on the smoothness of the function and the number of qubits available, either of two methods is better than the other. In particular, when the function is nonsmooth or we want to save the qubit number, the sum-in-QAE method can be advantageous.

Changes in the environment or the machine configuration may affect their dependability. Through analysis of real quantum computer calibration data, this work demonstrates that quantum computers available from IBM Quantum experience periods of fluctuation or abrupt qubit frequency changes. This work further analyzes the correlation between the frequency change events, decoherence times, gate errors, and machine maintenance or offine periods. The results highlight that the properties of NISQ computers change over time, affecting their dependability, but not all of the changes can be explained with publicly available data.

TI Remote cross-resonance gate between superconducting fixed-frequency
   qubits
SO QUANTUM SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB High-fidelity quantum state transfer and remote entanglement between superconducting fixed-frequency qubits have not yet been realized. In this study, we propose an alternative remote cross-resonance gate. Considering multiple modes of a superconducting coaxial cable connecting qubits, we must find conditions under which the cross-resonance gate operates with a certain accuracy even in the presence of qubit frequency shifts due to manufacturing errors. For 0.25- and 0.5 m cables, remote cross-resonance gates with a concurrence of > 99.9 % in entanglement generation are obtained even with +/- 10 MHz frequency shifts. For a 1 m cable with a narrow mode spacing, a concurrence of 99.5% is achieved by reducing the coupling between the qubits and cable. The optimized echoed raised-cosine pulse duration is 150-400 ns, which is similar to the operation time of cross-resonance gates between neighboring qubits on a chip. The dissipation through the cable modes does not considerably affect the obtained results. Such high-precision quantum interconnects pave the way not only for scaling up quantum computer systems but also for nonlocal connections on a chip.

TI Xor-And-Inverter Graphs for Quantum Compilation
SO NPJ QUANTUM INFORMATION
AB Quantum compilation is the task of translating a high-level description of a quantum algorithm into a sequence of low-level quantum operations. We propose and motivate the use of Xor-And-Inverter Graphs (XAG) to specify Boolean functions for quantum compilation. We present three different XAG-based compilation algorithms to synthesize quantum circuits in the Clifford + T library, hence targeting fault-tolerant quantum computing. The algorithms are designed to minimize relevant cost functions, such as the number of qubits, the T-count, and the T-depth, while allowing the flexibility of exploring different solutions. We present novel resource estimation results for relevant cryptographic and arithmetic benchmarks. The achieved results show a significant reduction in both T-count and T-depth when compared with the state-of-the-art.

TI Analytic gradients in variational quantum algorithms: Algebraic
   extensions of the parameter-shift rule to general unitary
   transformations
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Optimization of unitary transformations in variational quantum algorithms benefits highly from efficient evaluation of cost function gradients with respect to amplitudes of unitary generators. We propose several extensions of the parameter-shift rule to formulating these gradients as linear combinations of expectation values for generators with general eigenspectra (i.e., with more than two eigenvalues). Our approaches are exact and do not use any auxiliary qubits; instead they rely on a generator eigenspectrum analysis. Two main directions in the parameter-shift-rule extensions are (1) polynomial expansion of the exponential unitary operator based on a limited number of different eigenvalues in the generator and (2) decomposition of the generator as a linear combination of low-eigenvalue operators (e.g., operators with only two or three eigenvalues). These techniques have a range of scalings for the number of needed expectation values with the number of generator eigenvalues from quadratic (for polynomial expansion) to linear and even log2 (for generator decompositions). This allowed us to propose efficient differentiation schemes for commonly used two-qubit transformations (e.g., match gates, transmon gates, and fSim gates) and (S) over cap2-conserving fermionic operators for the variational quantum eigensolver.

TI Robust two-state swap by stimulated Raman adiabatic passage
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICS B-ATOMIC MOLECULAR AND OPTICAL PHYSICS
AB Efficient initialization and manipulation of quantum states is important for numerous applications and it usually requires the ability to perform high fidelity and robust swapping of the populations of quantum states. Stimulated Raman adiabatic passage (STIRAP) has been known to perform efficient and robust inversion of the ground states populations of a three-level system. However, its performance is sensitive to the initial state of the system. In this contribution we demonstrate that a slight modification of STIRAP, where we introduce a non-zero single-photon detuning, allows for efficient and robust population swapping for any initial state. The results of our work could be useful for efficient and robust state preparation, dynamical decoupling and design of quantum gates in ground state qubits via two-photon interactions.

AB Finding shape correspondences can be formulated as an NP-hard quadratic assignment problem (QAP) that becomes infeasible for shapes with high sampling density. A promising research direction is to tackle such quadratic optimization problems over binary variables with quantum annealing, which allows for some problems a more efficient search in the solution space. Unfortunately, enforcing the linear equality constraints in QAPs via a penalty significantly limits the success probability of such methods on currently available quantum hardware. To address this limitation, this paper proposes Q-Match, i.e., a new iterative quantum method for QAPs inspired by the a-expansion algorithm, which allows solving problems of an order of magnitude larger than current quantum methods. It implicitly enforces the QAP constraints by updating the current estimates in a cyclic fashion. Further, Q-Match can be applied iteratively, on a subset of well-chosen correspondences, allowing us to scale to real-world problems. Using the latest quantum annealer, the D-Wave Advantage, we evaluate the proposed method on a subset of QAPLIB as well as on isometric shape matching problems from the FAUST dataset.

TI Entanglement-assisted concatenated quantum codes
SO PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF
   AMERICA
AB Entanglement-assisted concatenated quantum codes (EACQCs), constructed by concatenating two quantum codes, are proposed. These EACQCs show significant advantages over standard concatenated quantum codes (CQCs). First, we prove that, unlike standard CQCs, EACQCs can beat the nondegenerate Hamming bound for entanglement-assisted quantum error-correction codes (EAQECCs). Second, we construct families of EACQCs with parameters better than the best-known standard quantum error-correction codes (QECCs) and EAQECCs. Moreover, these EACQCs require very few Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR) pairs to begin with. Finally, it is shown that EACQCs make entanglement-assisted quantum communication possible, even if the ebits are noisy. Furthermore, EACQCs can outperform CQCs in entanglement fidelity over depolarizing channels if the ebits are less noisy than the qubits. We show that the error-probability threshold of EACQCs is larger than that of CQCs when the error rate of ebits is sufficiently lower than that of qubits. Specifically, we derive a high threshold of 47% when the error probability of the preshared entanglement is 1% to that of qubits.

TI Quantum entanglement between two antiferromagnets in the microcavities
SO EPL
AB Magnons are being currently developed as qubits for quantum storage and information processing. Here, in this work, we focus on a hybrid quantum system containing two antiferromagnets, and entanglement between magnons in the antiferromagnets can be generated through strong coupling mediated by the same microwave mode. Moreover, we numerically simulate the process with feasible parameters. The influence of the system parameters, such as the magnon-photon coupling rate, detuning, bias magnetic field and dissipation of entanglement, are discussed. By adjusting some of the experimental parameters, we show that two antiferromagnets can produce a large entanglement, which is a result that has not been previously found in other quantum systems. Our findings may provide a potential platform for the completion of related quantum tasks in the future. Copyright (C) 2022 EPLA

TI Quantum channel marginal problem
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Given a set of local dynamics, are they compatible with a global dynamics? We systematically formulate these questions as quantum channel marginal problems. These problems are strongly connected to the generalization of the no-signaling conditions to quantized inputs and outputs and can be understood as a general toolkit to study notions of quantum incompatibility. In fact, they include as special cases channel broadcasting, channel extendibility, measurement compatibility, and state marginal problems. After defining the notion of compatibility between global and local dynamics, we provide a solution to the channel marginal problem that takes the form of a semidefinite program. Using this formulation, we construct channel incompatibility witnesses, discuss their operational interpretation in terms of an advantage for a state-discrimination task, prove a gap between classical and quantum dynamical marginal problems, and show that the latter is irreducible to state marginal problems.

TI Scalable Atomic Arrays for Spin-Based Quantum Computers in Silicon
SO ADVANCED MATERIALS
AB Semiconductor spin qubits combine excellent quantum performance with the prospect of manufacturing quantum devices using industry-standard metal-oxide-semiconductor (MOS) processes. This applies also to ion-implanted donor spins, which further afford exceptional coherence times and large Hilbert space dimension in their nuclear spin. Here multiple strategies are demonstrated and integrated to manufacture scale-up donor-based quantum computers. 31PF2 molecule implants are used to triple the placement certainty compared to 31P ions, while attaining 99.99% confidence in detecting the implant. Similar confidence is retained by implanting heavier atoms such as 123Sb and 209Bi, which represent high-dimensional qudits for quantum information processing, while Sb2 molecules enable deterministic formation of closely-spaced qudits. The deterministic formation of regular arrays of donor atoms with 300 nm spacing is demonstrated, using step-and-repeat implantation through a nano aperture. These methods cover the full gamut of technological requirements for the construction of donor-based quantum computers in silicon.
   Ion-implanted silicon donor spin qubits afford exceptional quantum performance and show promise for the maturation to powerful quantum computers using standard semiconductor industry processes. This study presents a comprehensive technological suite for the scalable deterministic construction of donor-based qubit and qudit arrays that could be used as quantum processor architectures. image

TI Fitting quantum machine learning potentials to experimental free energy
   data: predicting tautomer ratios in solution
SO CHEMICAL SCIENCE
AB The computation of tautomer ratios of druglike molecules is enormously important in computer-aided drug discovery, as over a quarter of all approved drugs can populate multiple tautomeric species in solution. Unfortunately, accurate calculations of aqueous tautomer ratios-the degree to which these species must be penalized in order to correctly account for tautomers in modeling binding for computer-aided drug discovery-is surprisingly difficult. While quantum chemical approaches to computing aqueous tautomer ratios using continuum solvent models and rigid-rotor harmonic-oscillator thermochemistry are currently state of the art, these methods are still surprisingly inaccurate despite their enormous computational expense. Here, we show that a major source of this inaccuracy lies in the breakdown of the standard approach to accounting for quantum chemical thermochemistry using rigid rotor harmonic oscillator (RRHO) approximations, which are frustrated by the complex conformational landscape introduced by the migration of double bonds, creation of stereocenters, and introduction of multiple conformations separated by low energetic barriers induced by migration of a single proton. Using quantum machine learning (QML) methods that allow us to compute potential energies with quantum chemical accuracy at a fraction of the cost, we show how rigorous relative alchemical free energy calculations can be used to compute tautomer ratios in vacuum free from the limitations introduced by RRHO approximations. Furthermore, since the parameters of QML methods are tunable, we show how we can train these models to correct limitations in the underlying learned quantum chemical potential energy surface using free energies, enabling these methods to learn to generalize tautomer free energies across a broader range of predictions.

TI Incompatibility as a Resource for Programmable Quantum Instruments
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB Quantum instruments represent the most general type of quantum measurement, as they incorporate processes with both classical and quantum outputs. In many scenarios, it may be desirable to have some "on-demand" device that is capable of implementing one of many possible instruments whenever the experimenter desires. We refer to such objects as programmable instrument devices (PIDs), and this paper studies PIDs from a resource-theoretic perspective. A physically important class of PIDs are those that do not require quantum memories to implement, and these are naturally "free" in this resource theory. Additionally, these free objects correspond precisely to the class of unsteerable channel assemblages in the study of channel steering. The traditional notion of measurement incompatibility emerges as a resource in this theory since any PID controlling an incompatible family of instruments requires a quantum memory to build. We identify an incompatibility preorder between PIDs based on whether one can be transformed into another using processes that do not require additional quantum memories. Necessary and sufficient conditions are derived for when such transformations are possible based on how well certain guessing games can be played using a given PID. Ultimately our results provide an operational characterization of incompatibility, and they offer semi-device-independent tests for incompatibility in the most general types of quantum instruments.

TI Classically emulated digital quantum simulation of the Schwinger model
   with a topological term via adiabatic state preparation
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW D
AB We designed a protocol for digital quantum computation of a gauge theory with a topological term in Minkowski spacetime, which is practically inaccessible by standard lattice Monte Carlo simulations. We focus on 1 ?? 1 dimensional quantum electrodynamics with the ?? term known as the Schwinger model and test our protocol for this on an IBM simulator. We construct the true vacuum state of a lattice Schwinger model using adiabatic state preparation which, in turn, allows us to compute an expectation value of the fermion mass operator with respect to the vacuum. Upon taking a continuum limit we find that our result in the massless case agrees with the known exact result. In the massive case, we find an agreement with mass perturbation theory in the small-mass regime and deviations in the large-mass regime. We estimate computational costs required to take a reasonable continuum limit. Our results imply that digital quantum simulation appears a promising tool to explore nonperturbative aspects of gauge theories with real time and topological terms.

TI Non-Gaussian quantum steering produced by quasi-phase-matching
   third-harmonic generation
SO NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB With the rapid advancements in fields such as quantum entanglement distillation and quantum metrology, the limitations of Gaussian states in certain applications within quantum computing and information processing have come to the forefront. This has necessitated the development of methods to prepare non-Gaussian states, which exhibit negative Wigner values and are indispensable for enhancing the capabilities of quantum systems in these tasks. Wigner negativity, a renowned indicator of nonclassicality, is integral to quantum computing and the simulation of continuous-variable systems. It is also employed to discern non-Gaussian characteristics in optical fields. We demonstrate Gaussian Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR) steering between second and third harmonic generations prior to performing non-Gaussian operations. Inducing non-Gaussian attributes in the second harmonic is achieved by coupling the third harmonic with a vacuum state and subtracting photons via a beamsplitter. The Wigner stochastic trajectory approach is utilized to investigate the non-Gaussian properties of both the second and third harmonics. By varying the coupling parameter lambda lambda and the ratio of nonlinear coupling constants kappa 2/kappa 1, symmetric and asymmetric non-Gaussian EPR steering can be observed. This proposed scheme for non-Gaussian EPR steering holds promise for applications in quantum computing and quantum information processing.

TI Thermal state quantum key distribution
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICS B-ATOMIC MOLECULAR AND OPTICAL PHYSICS
AB We analyse a central broadcast continuous variable quantum key distribution protocol in which a beam produced by a thermal source is used to create a secret key between two parties, Alice and Bob. A beam splitter divides the initial beam into a pair of output beams, which are sent to Alice and Bob, with Eve intercepting Bob's beam. We investigate the protocol in detail, calculating mutual informations through a pair of analytic methods and comparing the results to the outputs of a Monte Carlo simulation of the protocol. In a lossless system, we find that a lower bound on the key rate remains positive in the protocol under a beam splitter attack, provided Bob receives a nonzero proportion of the beam initially sent to him. This suggests that the thermal state protocol could be used experimentally to produce secure keys.

TI Quantum Channels with Quantum Group Symmetry
SO COMMUNICATIONS IN MATHEMATICAL PHYSICS
AB In this paper we will demonstrate that any compact quantum group can be used as symmetries for quantum channels, which leads us to the concept of covariant channels. We then unearth the structure of the convex set of covariant channels by identifying all extreme points under the assumption ofmultiplicity-free condition for the associated fusion rule, which provides awide generalization of the results of Mozrzymas et al. (J Math Phys 58(5):052204, 2017). The presence of quantum group symmetry in contrast to the group symmetry will be highlighted in the examples of quantum permutation groups and SUq(2). In the latter example, we will see the necessity of the Heisenberg picture coming from the non-Kac type condition. This paper ends with the covariance with respect to projective representations, which leads us back to Weyl covariant channels and its fermionic analogue.

TI Silicon photonics interfaced with microelectronics for integrated
   photonic quantum technologies: a new era in advanced quantum computers
   and quantum communications?
SO NANOSCALE
AB Silicon photonics is rapidly evolving as an advanced chip framework for implementing quantum technologies. With the help of silicon photonics, general-purpose programmable networks with hundreds of discrete components have been developed. These networks can compute quantum states generated on-chip as well as more extraordinary functions like quantum transmission and random number generation. In particular, the interfacing of silicon photonics with complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) microelectronics enables us to build miniaturized quantum devices for next-generation sensing, communication, and generating randomness for assembling quantum computers. In this review, we assess the significance of silicon photonics and its interfacing with microelectronics for achieving the technology milestones in the next generation of quantum computers and quantum communication. To this end, especially, we have provided an overview of the mechanism of a homodyne detector and the latest state-of-the-art of measuring squeezed light along with its integration on a photonic chip. Finally, we present an outlook on future studies that are considered beneficial for the wide implementation of silicon photonics for distinct data-driven applications with maximum throughput.

TI Multiphoton non-local quantum interference controlled by an undetected
   photon
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB The interference of quanta lies at the heart of quantum physics. The multipartite generalization of single-quanta interference creates entanglement, the coherent superposition of states shared by several quanta. Entanglement allows non-local correlations between many quanta and hence is a key resource for quantum information technology. Entanglement is typically considered to be essential for creating non-local quantum interference. Here, we show that this is not the case and demonstrate multiphoton non-local quantum interference that does not require entanglement of any intrinsic properties of the photons. We harness the superposition of the physical origin of a four-photon product state, which leads to constructive and destructive interference with the photons' mere existence. With the intrinsic indistinguishability in the generation process of photons, we realize four-photon frustrated quantum interference. This allows us to observe the following noteworthy difference to quantum entanglement: We control the non-local multipartite quantum interference with a photon that we never detect, which does not require quantum entanglement. These non-local properties pave the way for the studies of foundations of quantum physics and potential applications in quantum technologies.

TI Heralded preparation of polarization entanglement via quantum scissors
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Quantum entanglement is at the heart of quantum information sciences and quantum technologies. In the optical domain, the most common type of quantum entanglement is polarization entanglement, which is usually created in a postselection manner involving destructive photon detection and thus hindering further applications which require readily available entanglement resources. In this work, we propose a scheme to prepare multipartite entangled states of polarized photons in a heralded manner, i.e., without postselection. We exploit the quantum scissors technique to truncate a given continuous-variable entanglement into the target entangled states which are of hybrid discrete-continuous or solely discrete types. We consider two implementations of the quantum scissors: one modified from the original quantum scissors [Pegg et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 81, 1604 (1998)] using single photons and linear optics and the other designed here using a type-II two-mode squeezer. We clarify the pros and cons of these two implementations as well as discussing practical aspects of the entanglement preparation. Our work illustrates an interface between various types of optical entanglement and the proposed quantum scissors techniques could serve as alternative methods for heralded generation of polarization entanglement.

TI The quantum hypercube as a k-mer graph
SO FRONTIERS IN BIOINFORMATICS
AB The application of quantum principles in computing has garnered interest since the 1980s. Today, this concept is not only theoretical, but we have the means to design and execute techniques that leverage the quantum principles to perform calculations. The emergence of the quantum walk search technique exemplifies the practical application of quantum concepts and their potential to revolutionize information technologies. It promises to be versatile and may be applied to various problems. For example, the coined quantum walk search allows for identifying a marked item in a combinatorial search space, such as the quantum hypercube. The quantum hypercube organizes the qubits such that the qubit states represent the vertices and the edges represent the transitions to the states differing by one qubit state. It offers a novel framework to represent k-mer graphs in the quantum realm. Thus, the quantum hypercube facilitates the exploitation of parallelism, which is made possible through superposition and entanglement to search for a marked k-mer. However, as found in the analysis of the results, the search is only sometimes successful in hitting the target. Thus, through a meticulous examination of the quantum walk search circuit outcomes, evaluating what input-target combinations are useful, and a visionary exploration of DNA k-mer search, this paper opens the door to innovative possibilities, laying down the groundwork for further research to bridge the gap between theoretical conjecture in quantum computing and a tangible impact in bioinformatics.

TI Entanglement Islands in 1D and 2D Lattices with Defects
SO ENTROPY
AB We investigate the spatial structure of quantum entanglement in one- and two-dimensional lattice systems containing structural defects, using the Time-Dependent Quantum Monte Carlo (TDQMC) method. By constructing reduced density matrices from ensembles of guide waves, we resolve spatial variations in both Coulomb-mediated entanglement and coherence without requiring full many-body wavefunctions. This approach reveals localized regions, entanglement islands, where quantum correlations are enhanced or suppressed due to the presence of vacancies or interaction inhomogeneities. In 1D systems, entanglement tends to concentrate near defects, while in 2D systems, we observe bridge-like and radially symmetric domains. Our results demonstrate that TDQMC offers a scalable and physically transparent framework for real-space quantum information analysis, with implications for information transfer in atomic-size structures, quantum materials, entanglement-based sensing, and coherent state engineering.

AB The increased development of quantum computing hardware in recent years has led to increased interest in its application to various areas. Finding effective ways to apply this technology to real-world use-cases is a current area of research in the remote sensing community. This article proposes an adiabatic quantum kitchen sinks (AQKS) kernel approximation algorithm with parallel quantum annealing on the D-Wave Advantage quantum annealer. The proposed implementation is applied to support vector regression and Gaussian process regression algorithms. To evaluate its performance, a regression problem related to estimating chlorophyll concentration in water is considered. The proposed algorithm was tested on two real-world datasets and its results were compared with those obtained by a classical implementation of kernel-based algorithms and a random kitchen sinks implementation. On average, the parallel AQKS achieved comparable results to the benchmark methods, indicating its potential for future applications.

TI Enhancing vacuum squeezing via magnetic field optimization

Compared with the case without the magnetic field, whose optimal squeezing degree is about -1.5 dB, this weak magnetic field can enhance the PSR effect and ultimately increase the squeezing degree. This compact squeezed light source can be potentially utilized in quantum protocols in which atomic ensembles are involved, such as in quantum memory, atomic magnetometers and quantum interferometers.

TI Molecular Optimization for Nuclear Spin State Control via a Single
   Electron Spin Qubit by Optimal Microwave Pulses: Quantum Control of
   Molecular Spin Qubits
SO APPLIED MAGNETIC RESONANCE
AB Quantum state control is one of the most important concepts in advanced quantum technology, emerging quantum cybernetics and related fields. Molecular open shell entities can be a testing ground for implementing quantum control technology enabling us to manipulate molecular spin quantum bits (molecular spin qubits). In well-designed molecular spins consisting of unpaired electron and nuclear spins, the electrons and nuclear spins can be bus and client qubits, respectively. Full control of molecular spin qubits, in which client spins interact via hyperfine coupling, is a key issue for implementing quantum computers (QCs). In solid-state QCs, there are two approaches to the control of nuclear client qubits, namely, direct control of nuclear spins by radio-wave (RF) pulses and indirect control via hyperfine interactions by microwave pulses applied to electron spin qubits. Although the latter is less popular in the literature, the indirectness has advantage of greatly reducing unnecessary interactions between a qubit system and its environment. In this work, we investigate molecular spin optimization to find optimal experimental conditions which can afford to achieve the high fidelity of quantum gates by the indirect control scheme. In the present quantum systems, one electron is directly controlled by pulsed ESR techniques without manipulating individual hyperfine resonance, but the states of two nuclear client spins are indirectly steered via hyperfine interactions. Single crystals of potassium hydrogen maleate (KHM) radical and C-13-labeled malonyl radical are chosen as typical molecular spin qubits which exemplify the importance of the symmetry of hyperfine tensors and their collinear properties. We have found that both the non-collinearity of the principal axes of hyperfine coupling tensors and the non-distinguishability/non-equivalency between nuclear spins are key issues which extremely reduce the gate fidelity.

SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICS-PHOTONICS
AB Achieving a high level of pulsed squeezing, in a platform which offers integration and stability, is a key requirement for continuous-variable quantum information processing. Typically highly squeezed states are achieved with narrow band optical cavities and bulk crystals, limiting scalability. Using single-pass parametric down conversion in an integrated optical device, we demonstrate quadrature squeezing of picosecond pulses in a thin-film lithium niobate strip-loaded waveguide. For on-chip peak powers of less than 0.3 W, we measure up to -0.33 +/- 0.07 dB of squeezing with an inferred on-chip value of -1.7 +/- 0.4 dB. This work highlights the potential of the strip-loaded waveguide platform for broadband squeezing applications and the development of photonic quantum technologies.

TI Quantum Sensing and Light Guiding with Fluorescent Nanodiamond-Doped PVA
   Fibers
SO ADVANCED OPTICAL MATERIALS
AB Fluorescent nanodiamonds (FNDs) containing quantum defects enable the optical measurement of electromagnetic fields and temperature and are among the most developed nanoscale quantum sensors today. Yet, for many applications in biomedicine and beyond, FNDs must be integrated into biocompatible substrates that preserve FND sensitivity and bring FNDs within nanoscale distance of their sensing target. At the same time, the high excitation light intensity required for most quantum sensing protocols remains a major challenge for applications in biomedicine. Here, it is shown that FNDs embedded in polyvinyl-alcohol (PVA) fibers are a powerful 3D platform for nanoscale quantum sensing via light guiding. First, it is demonstrated that biocompatible PVA fibers can guide light to excite FNDs >10 mu m from the excitation beam. Using this light-guiding-enabled excitation, optically detected magnetic resonance (ODMR) and T-1 spin relaxometry measurements are performed using the nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center in FNDs. Through ODMR thermometry, it is shown that light-guiding-enabled excitation mitigates light-induced heating. Finally, the quantum sensing capability of the platform is established by detecting paramagnetic gadolinium in a dry and aqueous environment using T-1 relaxometry of the NV center in FNDs. These results pave the way for light-guiding-enabled optical quantum sensing in biomedicine using nanodiamond-doped biosubstrates.

TI Excited states from ADAPT-VQE convergence path in many-body problems:
   Application to nuclear pairing problem and H4 molecule dissociation
SO PHYSICS LETTERS B
AB A quantum computing algorithm is proposed to obtain low-lying excited states in many-body interacting systems. The approximate eigenstates are obtained by using a quantum space diagonalization method in a subspace of states selected from the convergence path of the ADAPT-VQE (adaptive derivative-assembled pseudo-Trotter Ansatz variational quantum eigensolver) towards the ground state of the many-body problem. This method is shown to be accurate with only a small overhead in terms of quantum resources required to get the ground state. We also show that the quantum algorithm might be used to facilitate the convergence of the ADAPT-VQE method itself. Successful applications of the technique are made to like-particle pairing as well as neutron-proton pairing. Finally, the H4 molecule's dissociation also illustrates the technique, demonstrating its accuracy and versatility.

TI Hamiltonian simulation algorithms for near-term quantum hardware
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB The quantum circuit model is the de-facto way of designing quantum algorithms. Yet any level of abstraction away from the underlying hardware incurs overhead. In this work, we develop quantum algorithms for Hamiltonian simulation "one level below" the circuit model, exploiting the underlying control over qubit interactions available in most quantum hardware and deriving analytic circuit identities for synthesising multi-qubit evolutions from two-qubit interactions. We then analyse the impact of these techniques under the standard error model where errors occur per gate, and an error model with a constant error rate per unit time. To quantify the benefits of this approach, we apply it to time-dynamics simulation of the 2D spin Fermi-Hubbard model. Combined with new error bounds for Trotter product formulas tailored to the non-asymptotic regime and an analysis of error propagation, we find that e.g. for a 5 x 5 Fermi-Hubbard lattice we reduce the circuit depth from 1, 243, 586 using the best previous fermion encoding and error bounds in the literature, to 3, 209 in the per-gate error model, or the circuit-depth-equivalent to 259 in the per-time error model. This brings Hamiltonian simulation, previously beyond reach of current hardware for non-trivial examples, significantly closer to being feasible in the NISQ era.
   The way quantum simulation algorithms are translated into specific hardware implementations often translates into additional overhead. Here, the authors improve the efficiency of Hamiltonian simulation using a method that allows efficient synthesis of multi-qubit evolutions from two-qubit interactions.

TI Magnon- mediated qubit coupling determined via dissipation measurements
SO PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF
   AMERICA
AB Controlled interaction between localized and delocalized solid -state spin systems offers a compelling platform for on -chip quantum information processing with quantum spintronics. Hybrid quantum systems (HQSs) of localized nitrogen- vacancy (NV) centers in diamond and delocalized magnon modes in ferrimagnets-systems with naturally commensurate energies-have recently attracted significant attention, especially for interconnecting isolated spin qubits at length- scales far beyond those set by the dipolar coupling. However, despite extensive theoretical efforts, there is a lack of experimental characterization of the magnon- mediated interaction between NV centers, which is necessary to develop such hybrid quantum architectures. Here, we experimentally determine the magnon- mediated NV-NV coupling from the magnon- induced self- energy of NV centers. Our results are quantitatively consistent with a model in which the NV center is coupled to magnons by dipolar interactions. This work provides a versatile tool to characterize HQSs in the absence of strong coupling, informing future efforts to engineer entangled solid -state systems.

TI Non-classical correlations of accelerated observers interacting with a
   classical stochastic noise beyond the single mode approximation
SO OPTICAL AND QUANTUM ELECTRONICS
AB This paper investigates the behaviour of the quantum correlations for an accelerated two-qubit system during its interaction with a classical stochastic field, utilizing the Wigner function and concurrence. The non-classical behaviour is indicated by negative values of the Wigner function, while the degree of entanglement is demonstrated by the concurrence. To consider acceleration and interaction with a common or independent environment, we discard the single-mode approximation and utilize the Unruh construction of the quantum field mode in our analysis. Our results suggest that coherence suppression is caused by the acceleration effect, noise strength, and noise frequency. Through an examination of quantum concurrence, this study analyses the level of quantum entanglement that corresponds positively with negative values of the Wigner function. The findings indicate that coherence degradation in the initial system is reduced when observers interact independently with their environments, as opposed to interacting with a common environment. Additionally, the acceleration of both observers has an impact on coherence reduction. During system evolution, the Wigner function displays collapse and reappearance behaviour, while quantum entanglement undergoes local collapse and revival phenomena. Notably, common noise situations exhibit more rapid variation in both the Wigner function and entanglement compared to independent noise configurations.

TI Tunable Fiber-Cavity Enhanced Photon Emission from Defect Centers in hBN
SO ADVANCED OPTICAL MATERIALS
AB Realization of quantum photonic devices requires coupling single quantum emitters to the mode of optical resonators. In this work, a hybrid system consisting of defect centers in few-layer hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) grown by chemical vapor deposition and a fiber-based Fabry-Perot cavity is presented. The sub 10-nm thickness of hBN and its smooth surface enable efficient integration into the cavity mode. This hybrid platform is operated over a broad spectral range larger than 30 nm and its tuneability is used to explore different coupling regimes. Consequently, very large cavity-assisted signal enhancement up to 50-fold and strongly narrowed linewidths are achieved, which is owing to cavity funneling, a record for hBN-cavity systems. Additionally, an excitation and readout scheme is implemented for resonant excitation that allows to establish cavity-assisted photoluminescence excitation (PLE) spectroscopy. This work marks an important milestone for the deployment of 2D materials coupled to fiber-based cavities in practical quantum technologies.

TI Reformulation of the No-Free-Lunch Theorem for Entangled Datasets
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB The no-free-lunch (NFL) theorem is a celebrated result in learning theory that limits one's ability to learn a function with a training dataset. With the recent rise of quantum machine learning, it is natural to ask whether there is a quantum analog of the NFL theorem, which would restrict a quantum computer's ability to learn a unitary process with quantum training data. However, in the quantum setting, the training data can possess entanglement, a strong correlation with no classical analog. In this Letter, we show that entangled datasets lead to an apparent violation of the (classical) NFL theorem. This motivates a reformulation that accounts for the degree of entanglement in the training set. As our main result, we prove a quantum NFL theorem whereby the fundamental limit on the learnability of a unitary is reduced by entanglement. We employ Rigetti's quantum computer to test both the classical and quantum NFL theorems. Our Letter establishes that entanglement is a commodity in quantum machine learning.

TI Bright Silicon Carbide Single-Photon Emitting Diodes at Low
   Temperatures: Toward Quantum Photonics Applications
SO NANOMATERIALS
AB Color centers in silicon carbide have recently emerged as one of the most promising emitters for bright single-photon emitting diodes (SPEDs). It has been shown that, at room temperature, they can emit more than 10(9) photons per second under electrical excitation. However, the spectral emission properties of color centers in SiC at room temperature are far from ideal. The spectral properties could be significantly improved by decreasing the operating temperature. However, the densities of free charge carriers in SiC rapidly decrease as temperature decreases, which reduces the efficiency of electrical excitation of color centers by many orders of magnitude. Here, we study for the first time the temperature characteristics of SPEDs based on color centers in 4H-SiC. Using a rigorous numerical approach, we demonstrate that although the single-photon electroluminescence rate does rapidly decrease as temperature decreases, it is possible to increase the SPED brightness to 10(7) photons/s at 100 K using the recently predicted effect of hole superinjection in homojunction p-i-n diodes. This gives the possibility to achieve high brightness and good spectral properties at the same time, which paves the way toward novel quantum photonics applications of electrically driven color centers in silicon carbide.

TI On the Possibility of Classical Client Blind Quantum Computing
SO CRYPTOGRAPHY
AB Classical client remote state preparation (CC - RSP) is a primitive where a fully classical party (client) can instruct the preparation of a sequence of random quantum states on some distant party (server) in a way that the description is known to the client but remains hidden from the server. This primitive has many applications, most prominently, it makes blind quantum computing possible for classical clients. In this work, we give a protocol for classical client remote state preparation, that requires minimal resources. The protocol is proven secure against honest-but-curious servers and any malicious third party in a game-based security framework. We provide an instantiation of a trapdoor (approximately) 2-regular family of functions whose security is based on the hardness of the Learning-With-Errors problem, including a first analysis of the set of usable parameters. We also run an experimentation on IBM's quantum cloud using a toy function. This is the first proof-of-principle experiment of classical client remote state preparation.

TI Floquet-enhanced spin swaps
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB The transfer of information between quantum systems is essential for quantum communication and computation. In quantum computers, high connectivity between qubits can improve the efficiency of algorithms, assist in error correction, and enable high-fidelity readout. However, as with all quantum gates, operations to transfer information between qubits can suffer from errors associated with spurious interactions and disorder between qubits, among other things. Here, we harness interactions and disorder between qubits to improve a swap operation for spin eigenstates in semiconductor gate-defined quantum-dot spins. We use a system of four electron spins, which we configure as two exchange-coupled singlet-triplet qubits. Our approach, which relies on the physics underlying discrete time crystals, enhances the quality factor of spin-eigenstate swaps by up to an order of magnitude. Our results show how interactions and disorder in multi-qubit systems can stabilize non-trivial quantum operations and suggest potential uses for non-equilibrium quantum phenomena, like time crystals, in quantum information processing applications. Our results also confirm the long-predicted emergence of effective Ising interactions between exchange-coupled singlet-triplet qubits. Information transfer between distant qubits suffers from spurious interactions and disorder. Here, the authors report up to an order of magnitude enhancement in the quality factor of a swap operation of eigenstates in a quantum dot chain, by using a periodic driving protocol inspired by discrete time crystals.

AB (Sender-)Deniable encryption provides a very strong privacy guarantee: a sender who is coerced by an attacker into "opening" their ciphertext after-the-fact is able to generate "fake" local random choices that are consistent with any plaintext of their choice. The only known fully-efficient constructions of public-key deniable encryption rely on indistinguishability obfuscation (iO) (which currently can only be based on sub-exponential hardness assumptions).
   In this work, we study (sender-)deniable encryption in a setting where the encryption procedure is a quantum algorithm, but the ciphertext is classical. First, we propose a quantum analog of the classical definition in this setting. We give a fully efficient construction satisfying this definition, assuming the quantum hardness of the Learning with Errors (LWE) problem.
   Second, we show that quantum computation unlocks a fundamentally stronger form of deniable encryption, whichwe call perfect unexplainability. The primitive at the heart of unexplainability is a quantum computation for which there is provably no efficient way, such as exhibiting the "history of the computation," to establish that the output was indeed the result of the computation. We give a construction which is secure in the random oracle model, assuming the quantum hardness of LWE. Crucially, this notion implies a form of protection against coercion "before-the-fact", a property that is impossible to achieve classically.

TI Time-warping invariant quantum recurrent neural networks via
   quantum-classical adaptive gating
SO MACHINE LEARNING-SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB Adaptive gating plays a key role in temporal data processing via classical recurrent neural networks (RNNs), as it facilitates retention of past information necessary to predict the future, providing a mechanism that preserves invariance to time warping transformations. This paper builds on quantum RNNs (QRNNs), a dynamic model with quantum memory, to introduce a novel class of temporal data processing quantum models that preserve invariance to time-warping transformations of the (classical) input-output sequences. The model, referred to as time warping-invariant QRNN (TWI-QRNN), augments a QRNN with a quantum-classical adaptive gating mechanism that chooses whether to apply a parameterized unitary transformation at each time step as a function of the past samples of the input sequence via a classical recurrent model. The TWI-QRNN model class is derived from first principles, and its capacity to successfully implement time-warping transformations is experimentally demonstrated on examples with classical or quantum dynamics.

This work underscores the confluence of two recent cutting-edge advances. On the one hand, the quantum integration algorithm quantum Fourier iterative amplitude estimation, which efficiently decomposes the target function into its Fourier series through a quantum neural network before quantumly integrating the corresponding Fourier components. On the other hand, causal unitary in the loop-tree duality (LTD), which exploits the causal properties of vacuum amplitudes in LTD to coherently generate all contributions with different numbers of final-state particles to a scattering or decay process, leading to singularity-free integrands that are well suited for Fourier decomposition. We test the performance of the quantum algorithm with benchmark decay rates in a quantum simulator and in quantum hardware, and find accurate theoretical predictions in both settings.

TI Quantum algorithms for geologic fracture networks
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB Solving large systems of equations is a challenge for modeling natural phenomena, such as simulating subsurface flow. To avoid systems that are intractable on current computers, it is often necessary to neglect information at small scales, an approach known as coarse-graining. For many practical applications, such as flow in porous, homogenous materials, coarse-graining offers a sufficiently-accurate approximation of the solution. Unfortunately, fractured systems cannot be accurately coarse-grained, as critical network topology exists at the smallest scales, including topology that can push the network across a percolation threshold. Therefore, new techniques are necessary to accurately model important fracture systems. Quantum algorithms for solving linear systems offer a theoretically-exponential improvement over their classical counterparts, and in this work we introduce two quantum algorithms for fractured flow. The first algorithm, designed for future quantum computers which operate without error, has enormous potential, but we demonstrate that current hardware is too noisy for adequate performance. The second algorithm, designed to be noise resilient, already performs well for problems of small to medium size (order 10-1000 nodes), which we demonstrate experimentally and explain theoretically. We expect further improvements by leveraging quantum error mitigation and preconditioning.

TI Data-driven modeling of S0 → S1 excitation energy
   in the BODIPY chemical space: High-throughput computation, quantum
   machine learning, and inverse design
SO JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL PHYSICS
AB Derivatives of BODIPY are popular fluorophores due to their synthetic feasibility, structural rigidity, high quantum yield, and tunable spectroscopic properties. While the characteristic absorption maximum of BODIPY is at 2.5 eV, combinations of functional groups and substitution sites can shift the peak position by +/- 1 eV. Time-dependent long-range corrected hybrid density functional methods can model the lowest excitation energies offering a semi-quantitative precision of +/- 0.3 eV. Alas, the chemical space of BODIPYs stemming from combinatorial introduction of-even a few dozen-substituents is too large for brute-force high-throughput modeling. To navigate this vast space, we select 77412 molecules and train a kernel-based quantum machine learning model providing <2% hold-out error. Further reuse of the results presented here to navigate the entire BODIPY universe comprising over 253 giga (253 x 10(9)) molecules is demonstrated by inverse-designing candidates with desired target excitation energies.

TI Designing quantum blockchain system integrated with 6G network
SO JOURNAL OF KING SAUD UNIVERSITY COMPUTER AND INFORMATION SCIENCES
AB The sixth-generation (6G) network utilizes state-of-the-art machine learning technology and obtains high attention, while the fifth-generation (5G) industry is still developing globally. Unfortunately, 6G encounters challenges to achieve performance superiority, such as scalability, massive connection, integrity, and trust. As a result, future network technologies are migrating away from centralized management entities and toward decentralized and distributed ledger technology, such as blockchain. However, the security of the blockchain is based on the computational complexity of solving specific mathematical problems that are impossible to solve on existing computers in real-time. On the other hand, quantum computers can effortlessly translate such problems with easy decryption. As a result, this study presents an architecture demonstrating the integration of quantum blockchain (QBC) with 6G networks. To show the quantum advantage, highly entangled/secured QBC of 5-, 6-, and 7-qubits are used to create the above system's quantum circuits. After circuit optimization, mitigation is executed with the efficiency analysis to show the advantage of the error mitigation approach in recreating the state of the QBC circuit and executing on quantum hardware. Furthermore, quantum algorithms of blockchain smart provenience contracts for the cloud-centric Internet of Things (IoT) are proposed, and corresponding quantum circuits are designed. The possible outcomes from these circuits based on the input transaction information are verified.

SO NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB We propose a method for the dynamical control in three-level open systems and realize it in the experiment with a superconducting qutrit. Our work demonstrates that in the Markovian environment for a relatively long time (3 mu s), the systemic populations or coherence can still strictly follow the preset evolution paths. This is the first experiment for precisely controlling the Markovian dynamics of three-level open systems, providing a solid foundation for the future realization of dynamical control in multiple open systems. An instant application of the technique demonstrated in this experiment is to stabilize the energy of quantum batteries.

TI Evolutionary Method of Sink Node Path Planning Guided by the Hamiltonian
   of Quantum Annealing Algorithm
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB In order to solve the NP-hard problem of mobile sink path planning in wireless sensor networks (WSN) where the communication range is modeled as a circular area and overlaps with each other, this paper proposes a sink node path planning method guided by the Hamiltonian of quantum annealing algorithm (EMGH) to balance the energy consumption of wireless sensor networks, improve the network life and solve the energy hole problem. First of all, this paper analyzes the problem in theory, and transforms the characteristics of the problem into a mathematical model. The mathematical model considers that the sensor network itself is a travelling salesman problem (TSP), but also requires the shortest path of the mobile sink node. Then, the path of each node in the sensor network is iterated by quantum annealing algorithm, and an optimal TSP path is obtained by using quantum tunneling effect and quantum circuit to achieve parallelism. Finally, in the case of compressing the solution space, the moving path of the mobile sink node is quantum coded, and the Hamiltonian in the quantum annealing algorithm is taken as the guiding factor, and then the individual dimensions are moved, which improves the accuracy of the algorithm and speeds up the convergence speed of the algorithm. Finally, the feasibility of EMGH is verified by simulation experiments and comparison with other algorithms, which provides a reference for the optimization and improvement of path planning method.

AB Quantum Machine Learning (QML) is an emerging field at the intersection of quantum computing and machine learning, aiming to enhance classical machine learning methods by leveraging quantum mechanics principles such as entanglement and superposition. However, skepticism persists regarding the practical advantages of QML, mainly due to the current limitations of noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices. This study addresses these concerns by extensively assessing Quantum Neural Networks (QNNs)-quantum-inspired counterparts of Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs), demonstrating their effectiveness compared to classical methods. We systematically construct and evaluate twelve distinct QNN configurations, utilizing two unique quantum feature maps combined with six different entanglement strategies for ansatz design. Experiments conducted on a wind energy dataset reveal that QNNs employing the Z feature map achieve up to 93% prediction accuracy when forecasting wind power output using only four input parameters. Our findings show that QNNs outperform classical methods in predictive tasks, underscoring the potential of QML in real-world applications.

TI Lightly Boron-Doped Nanodiamonds for Quantum Sensing Applications
SO NANOMATERIALS
AB Unlike standard nanodiamonds (NDs), boron-doped nanodiamonds (BNDs) have shown great potential in heating a local environment, such as tumor cells, when excited with NIR lasers (808 nm). This advantage makes BNDs of special interest for hyperthermia and thermoablation therapy. In this study, we demonstrate that the negatively charged color center (NV) in lightly boron-doped nanodiamonds (BNDs) can optically sense small temperature changes when heated with an 800 nm laser even though the correct charge state of the NV is not expected to be as stable in a boron-doped diamond. The reported BNDs can sense temperature changes over the biological temperature range with a sensitivity reaching 250 mK/root Hz. These results suggest that BNDs are promising dual-function bio-probes in hyperthermia or thermoablation therapy as well as other quantum sensing applications, including magnetic sensing.

TI Thermodynamic Signature of Logical Depth in Quantum Circuits
SO FOUNDATIONS OF PHYSICS
AB We demonstrate that the internal logical structure of a quantum circuit can leave a distinct thermodynamic signature under progressive decoherence. By comparing deep, conditionally branching circuits with shallow, uniform counterparts-while controlling for overall halting probability and physical resources-we show that branching architectures induce greater entropy flow into the environment. This effect is captured by a logical depth factor \documentclass[12pt]{minimal} \usepackage{amsmath} \usepackage{wasysym} \usepackage{amsfonts} \usepackage{amssymb} \usepackage{amsbsy} \usepackage{mathrsfs} \usepackage{upgreek} \setlength{\oddsidemargin}{-69pt} \begin{document}$$L_d$$\end{document}, which quantifies entropy accumulation during environmental interactions. We validate our framework through detailed analysis of two 4-branch quantum circuits, demonstrating greater entropy production with \documentclass[12pt]{minimal} \usepackage{amsmath} \usepackage{wasysym} \usepackage{amsfonts} \usepackage{amssymb} \usepackage{amsbsy} \usepackage{mathrsfs} \usepackage{upgreek} \setlength{\oddsidemargin}{-69pt} \begin{document}$$L_d \approx 1.615$$\end{document} for conditional versus uniform architectures. An ancilla-based experimental protocol using controlled-phase gates provides a concrete pathway for detecting these thermodynamic signatures on current quantum platforms. Our results establish logical depth as a physically measurable quantity with implications for circuit design, compilation strategies, and verification protocols.

TI Security proof for variable-length quantum key distribution
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB We present a security proof for variable-length QKD in the Renner framework against IID collective attacks. Our proof can be lifted to coherent attacks using the postselection technique. Our first main result is a theorem to convert a sequence of security proofs for fixed-length protocols satisfying certain conditions to a security proof for a variable-length protocol. This conversion requires no new calculations, does not require any changes to the final key lengths or the amount of error-correction information, and at most doubles the security parameter. Our second main result is the description and security proof of a more general class of variable-length QKD protocols, which does not require characterizing the honest behavior of the channel connecting the users before the execution of the QKD protocol. Instead, these protocols adaptively determine the length of the final key, and the amount of information to be used for error correction, based upon the observations made during the protocol. We apply these results to the qubit BB84 protocol, and show that variable-length implementations lead to higher expected key rates than the fixed-length implementations.

TI Joint photon-number splitting attack on semi-quantum key distribution
SO FRONTIERS IN PHYSICS
AB Semi-quantum key distribution is based on the basic principle of quantum mechanics, which allows a classical user and quantum user to use information theory to have a secure shared key. In 2021, our research group proved the first proof-of-principle experimental demonstration of semi-quantum key distribution and verified its feasibility. Due to the limitations of existing science and technology, the experimental system still features a combination of multiphoton signal source and loss in the transmission line. This makes semi-quantum key distribution as susceptible to a photon-number splitting attack as quantum key distribution, leading to limitations of secure transmission distance. It seems that practical single-state semi-quantum key distribution can overcome photon-number splitting attack due to the SIRT bits (also known as the "sifted key "). However, its dual-channel feature still opens up an observation window to Eve. We present two joint photon-number splitting attacks suitable for a single-state semi-quantum key distribution system and show that through the joint photon-number splitting attack, Eve can obtain key information without being detected by Alice or Bob.

TI Photonic counterdiabatic quantum optimization algorithm
SO COMMUNICATIONS PHYSICS
AB One of the key applications of near-term quantum computers has been the development of quantum optimization algorithms. However, these algorithms have largely been focused on qubit-based technologies. Here, we propose a hybrid quantum-classical approximate optimization algorithm for photonic quantum computing, specifically tailored for addressing continuous-variable optimization problems. Inspired by counterdiabatic protocols, our algorithm reduces the required quantum operations for optimization compared to adiabatic protocols. This reduction enables us to tackle non-convex continuous optimization within the near-term era of quantum computing. Through illustrative benchmarking, we show that our approach can outperform existing state-of-the-art hybrid adiabatic quantum algorithms in terms of convergence and implementability. Our algorithm offers a practical and accessible experimental realization, bypassing the need for high-order operations and overcoming experimental constraints. We conduct a proof-of-principle demonstration on Xanadu's eight-mode nanophotonic quantum chip, successfully showcasing the feasibility and potential impact of the algorithm.
   The authors introduce a hybrid quantum-classical algorithm for photonic quantum computing that focuses on tackling continuous-variable optimization problems using fewer quantum operations than existing methods. The approach shows better performance and practical implementation potential, demonstrated on Xanadu's quantum chip.

TI Research on Financial Stock Market Prediction Based on the Hidden
   Quantum Markov Model
SO MATHEMATICS
AB Quantum finance, as a key application scenario of quantum computing, showcases multiple significant advantages of quantum machine learning over traditional machine learning methods. This paper first aims to overcome the limitations of the hidden quantum Markov model (HQMM) in handling continuous data and proposes an innovative method to convert continuous data into discrete-time sequence data. Second, a hybrid quantum computing model is developed to forecast stock market trends. The model was used to predict 15 stock indices from the Shanghai and Shenzhen Stock Exchanges between June 2018 and June 2021. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed quantum model outperforms classical algorithmic models in handling higher complexity, achieving improved efficiency, reduced computation time, and superior predictive performance. This validation of quantum advantage in financial forecasting enables the practical deployment of quantum-inspired prediction models by investors and institutions in trading environments. This quantum-enhanced model empowers investors to predict market regimes (bullish/bearish/range-bound) using real-time data, enabling dynamic portfolio adjustments, optimized risk controls, and data-driven allocation shifts.

TI On-Chip Quantum Interference between Independent Lithium
   Niobate-on-Insulator Photon-Pair Sources
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB Generating and interfering nonclassical states of light is fundamental to optical quantum information science and technology. Quantum photonic integrated circuits provide one pathway towards scalability by combining nonlinear sources of nonclassical light and programmable circuits in centimeter-scale devices. The key requirements for quantum applications include efficient generation of indistinguishable photonpairs and high-visibility programmable quantum interference. Here, we demonstrate a lithium niobate-oninsulator (LNOI) integrated photonic circuit that generates a two-photon path-entangled state, and a programmable interferometer for quantum interference. We generate entangled photons with similar to 2.3 x 108 pairs/s/mW brightness and perform quantum interference experiments on the chip with 96.8 + 3.6% visibility. LNOI is an emerging photonics technology that has revolutionized high-speed modulators and efficient frequency conversion. Our results provide a path towards large-scale integrated quantum photonics including efficient photon-pair generation and programmable circuits for applications such as boson sampling and quantum communications.

Entanglement and squeezing of HHG light would open fascinating perspectives in quantum technology, with the emergence of a field of basic and applied research: attosecond quantum optics. Here, we measure entanglement in a tripartite solid-state HHG system through the violation of a Cauchy-Schwarz inequality. Displaced squeezing is experimentally observed and supported by numerical simulations with excellent agreement to the data. The Schmidt number is estimated, which indicates a low-dimensional multimode structure for each harmonic, an important property for most quantum technologies. At the applied level, the semiconductor HHG source is scalable, integrable, operates at room temperature with compact lasers, and thus represents a useful and exploitable resource in quantum photonics.

TI Qubit noise deconvolution
SO EPJ QUANTUM TECHNOLOGY
AB We present a noise deconvolution technique to remove a wide class of noises when performing arbitrary measurements on qubit systems. In particular, we derive the inverse map of the most common single qubit noisy channels, and exploit it at the data processing step to obtain noise-free estimates of observables evaluated on a qubit system subject to known noise. We illustrate a self-consistency check to ensure that the noise characterization is accurate providing simulation results for the deconvolution of a generic Pauli channel, as well as experimental evidence of the deconvolution of decoherence noise occurring on Rigetti quantum hardware.

TI High-fidelity quantum information transmission using a room-temperature
   nonrefrigerated lossy microwave waveguide
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB Quantum microwave transmission is key to realizing modular superconducting quantum computers and distributed quantum networks. A large number of incoherent photons are thermally generated within the microwave frequency spectrum. The closeness of the transmitted quantum state to the source-generated quantum state at the input of the transmission link (measured by the transmission fidelity) degrades due to the presence of the incoherent photons. Hence, high-fidelity quantum microwave transmission has long been considered to be infeasible without refrigeration. In this study, we propose a novel method for high-fidelity quantum microwave transmission using a room-temperature lossy waveguide. The proposed scheme consists of connecting two cryogenic nodes (i.e., a transmitter and a receiver) by the room-temperature lossy microwave waveguide. First, cryogenic preamplification is implemented prior to transmission. Second, at the receiver side, a cryogenic loop antenna is placed inside the output port of the waveguide and coupled to an LC harmonic oscillator located outside the waveguide. The loop antenna converts quantum microwave fields to a quantum voltage across the coupled LC harmonic oscillator. Noise photons are induced across the LC oscillator including the source generated noise, the preamplification noise, the thermal occupation of the waveguide, and the fluctuation-dissipation noise. The loop antenna detector at the receiver is designed to extensively suppress the induced photons across the LC oscillator. The signal transmittance is maintained intact by providing significant preamplification gain. Our calculations show that high-fidelity quantum transmission (i.e., more than 95%) is realized based on the proposed scheme for transmission distances reaching 100 m.

TI Encoding-dependent generalization bounds for parametrized quantum
   circuits
SO QUANTUM
AB A large body of recent work has begun to explore the potential of parametrized quantum circuits (PQCs) as machine learning models, within the framework of hybrid quantum-classical optimization. In particular, theoretical guarantees on the out-of-sample performance of such models, in terms of generalization bounds, have emerged. However, none of these generalization bounds depend explicitly on how the classical input data is encoded into the PQC. We derive generalization bounds for PQC-based models that depend explicitly on the strategy used for data-encoding. These imply bounds on the performance of trained PQC-based models on unseen data. Moreover, our results facilitate the selection of optimal data-encoding strategies via structural risk minimization, a mathematically rigorous framework for model selection. We obtain our generalization bounds by bounding the complexity of PQC-based models as measured by the Rademacher complexity and the metric entropy, two complexity measures from statistical learning theory. To achieve this, we rely on a representation of PQC-based models via trigonometric functions. Our generalization bounds emphasize the importance of well-considered data-encoding strategies for PQC-based models.

TI Real-Time Nonperturbative Dynamics of Jet Production in Schwinger Model:
   Quantum Entanglement and Vacuum Modification
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB The production of jets should allow testing the real-time response of the QCD vacuum disturbed by the propagation of high-momentum color charges. Addressing this problem theoretically requires a real-time, nonperturbative method. It is well known that the Schwinger model [QED in (1 + 1) dimensions] shares many common properties with QCD, including confinement, chiral symmetry breaking, and the existence of vacuum fermion condensate. As a step in developing such an approach, we report here on fully quantum simulations of a massive Schwinger model coupled to external sources representing quark and antiquark jets as produced in e+e- annihilation. We study, for the first time, the modification of the vacuum chiral condensate by the propagating jets and the quantum entanglement between the fragmenting jets. Our results indicate strong entanglement between the fragmentation products of the two jets at rapidity separations & UDelta;& eta; & LE; 2, which can potentially exist also in QCD and can be studied in experiments.

TI Nuclear scattering via quantum computing
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW C
AB We propose a hybrid quantum-classical framework to solve the elastic-scattering phase shift of two wellbound nuclei in an uncoupled channel. Within this framework, we develop a many-body formalism in which the continuum scattering states of the two colliding nuclei are regulated by a weak external harmonic-oscillator potential with varying strength. Based on our formalism, we propose an approach to compute the eigenenergies of the low-lying scattering states of the relative motion of the colliding nuclei as a function of the oscillator strength of the confining potential. Utilizing the modified effective range expansion, we extrapolate the elastic-scattering phase shift of the colliding nuclei from these eigenenergies to the limit when the external potential vanishes. In our hybrid approach, we leverage the advantage of quantum computing to solve for these eigenenergies from a set of many-nucleon Hamiltonian eigenvalue problems. These eigenenergies are inputs to classical computers to obtain the phase shift. We demonstrate our framework with two simple problems, where we implement the rodeo algorithm to solve the relevant eigenenergies with the IBM Qiskit quantum simulator. The results of both the spectra and the elastic-scattering phase shifts agree well with other theoretical results.

TI Demonstration of a two-bit controlled-NOT quantum-like gate using
   classical acoustic qubit-analogues
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB The Controlled-NOT (CNOT) gate is the key to unlock the power of quantum computing as it is a fundamental component of a universal set of gates. We demonstrate the operation of a two-bit C-NOT quantum-like gate using classical qubit acoustic analogues, called herein logical phi-bits. The logical phi-bits are supported by an externally driven nonlinear acoustic metamaterial composed of a parallel array of three elastically coupled waveguides. A logical phi-bit has a two-state degree of freedom associated with the two independent relative phases of the acoustic wave in the three waveguides. A simple physical manipulation involving the detuning of the frequency of one of the external drivers is shown to operate on the complex vectors in the Hilbert space of pairs of logical phi-bits. This operation achieves a systematic and predictable C-NOT gate with unambiguously measurable input and output. The possibility of scaling the approach to more phi-bits is promising.

TI High-Quality Thermal Gibbs Sampling with Quantum Annealing Hardware
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW APPLIED
AB Quantum annealing (QA) was originally intended for accelerating the solution of combinatorial optimization tasks that have natural encodings as Ising models. However, recent experiments on QA-hardware platforms have demonstrated that, in the operating regime corresponding to weak interactions, the QA hardware behaves like a noisy Gibbs sampler at a hardware-specific effective temperature. This work builds on those insights and identifies a class of small hardware-native Ising models that are robust to noise effects and proposes a procedure for executing these models on QA hardware to maximize Gibbssampling performance. The experimental results indicate that the proposed protocol results in high-quality Gibbs samples from a hardware-specific effective temperature. Furthermore, we show that this effective temperature can be adjusted by modulating the annealing time and energy scale. The procedure proposed in this work provides an approach to using QA hardware for Ising-model sampling presenting potential opportunities for applications in machine learning and physics simulation.

TI Quantum algorithms for Second-Order Cone Programming and Support Vector
   Machines
SO QUANTUM
AB We present a quantum interior-point method (IPM) for second-order cone programming (SOCP) that runs in time (O) over tilde (n root r zeta kappa/delta 2 log (1/epsilon) where r is the rank and n the dimension of the SOCP, zeta bounds the distance of intermediate solutions from the cone boundary, zeta is a parameter upper bounded by root n, and kappa is an upper bound on the condition number of matrices arising in the classical IPM for SOCP. The algorithm takes as its input a suitable quantum description of an arbitrary SOCP and outputs a classical description of a delta-approximate epsilon-optimal solution of the given problem.
   Furthermore, we perform numerical simulations to determine the values of the aforementioned parameters when solving the SOCP up to a fixed precision epsilon. We present experimental evidence that in this case our quantum algorithm exhibits a polynomial speedup over the best classical algorithms for solving general SOCPs that run in time O(n(omega+0.5)) (here, w is the matrix multiplication exponent, with a value of roughly 2.37 in theory, and up to 3 in practice). For the case of random SVM (support vector machine) instances of size O(n), the quantum algorithm scales as O(n(k)), where the exponent k is estimated to be 2.59 using a least-squares power law. On the same family random instances, the estimated scaling exponent for an external SOCP solver is 3.31 while that for a state-of-the-art SVM solver is 3.11.

TI Applications of a Quantum Linear System Algorithm to Linear MIMO
   Detections
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB A linear system can be solved more efficiently by quantum computing. However, previously known quantum algorithms provide only a quantum state as the solution; consequently, we cannot obtain the value of each component of the solution. We propose a method to extract the component values of the solution, and we present an application to linear multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) detections. In the proposed algorithm, we demonstrate a concrete method that applies a quantum linear system algorithm (QLSA) when the components of a solution have binary variables, quaternary variables, or roots of a complex number. Whereas the conventional method requires an additional process to read out the values of the components, the proposed algorithm does not need any post-procedure. Instead, our method uses a QLSA iteratively, and the number of uses is logarithmic in the size of the linear system. Thus, our method maintains the runtime with the quantum advantage, but the conventional approach increases the runtime significantly. Furthermore, the application of the proposed method shows that quantum computing can collaborate with communication systems for large-scale MIMO systems.

TI Demonstration of Scully-Drühl-type quantum erasers on quantum computers
SO NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB We present a novel quantum circuit that genuinely implements the Scully-Dr & uuml;hl-type delayed-choice quantum eraser, where the two recorders of the which-way information directly interact with the signal qubit and remain spatially separated. Experiments conducted on IBM Quantum and IonQ processors demonstrate that the recovery of interference patterns, to varying degrees, aligns closely with theoretical predictions, despite the presence of systematic errors. This quantum circuit-based approach, more manageable and versatile than traditional optical experiments, facilitates arbitrary adjustment of the erasure and enables a true random choice in a genuine delayed-choice manner. On the IBM Quantum platform, delay gates can be employed to further defer the random choice, thereby amplifying the retrocausal effect. Since gate operations are executed sequentially in time, the system does not have any involvement of random choice until after the signal qubit has been measured, therefore eliminating any potential philosophical loopholes regarding retrocausality that might exist in other experimental setups. Remarkably, quantum erasure is achieved with delay times up to similar to 1 mu s without noticeable decoherence, a feat challenging to replicate in optical setups.

AB Since the state-of-the-art quantum computers are still noisy and error-prone, classical simulation of quantum circuits is essential in verifying/calibrating quantum computers and prototyping/debugging complex quantum algorithms. Classical simulation of large quantum systems is challenging due to its exponential increase in space and computation requirements. In this paper, we propose a full-state simulation framework, SnuQS. It exploits storage devices, such as HDDs and NVMe SSDs, to enlarge the available main memory capacity at a small cost. To achieve maximum I/O bandwidth, we propose an overlay-based memory management technique and optimization techniques. We also propose an I/O subsystem architecture that guarantees the maximum bandwidth of each storage device. We evaluate SnuQS on a 64-core CPU and 4-GPU system with 80 2TB HDDs and 10 4TB NVMe SSDs using quantum supremacy and quantum Fourier transform circuits. The experimental result indicates that SnuQS and the proposed I/O subsystem together is an effective and practical solution to scale the full-state simulation of large quantum circuits at about 300x lower cost than the DDR4 DRAM main-memory-only system.

TI QUANTUM ALGORITHM FOR SIMULATING REAL TIME EVOLUTION OF LATTICE
   HAMILTONIANS
SO SIAM JOURNAL ON COMPUTING
AB We study the problem of simulating the time evolution of a lattice Hamiltonian, where the qubits are laid out on a lattice and the Hamiltonian only includes geometrically local interactions (i.e., a qubit may only interact with qubits in its vicinity). This class of Hamiltonians is very general and is believed to capture fundamental interactions of physics. Our algorithm simulates the time evolution of such a Hamiltonian on n qubits for time T up to error epsilon using O (nT polylog(nT/epsilon)) gates with depth O (T polylog(nT/epsilon)). Our algorithm is the first simulation algorithm that achieves gate cost quasilinear in nT and polylogarithmic in 1/epsilon. Our algorithm also readily generalizes to time-dependent Hamiltonians and yields an algorithm with similar gate count for any piecewise slowly varying time-dependent bounded local Hamiltonian. We also prove a matching lower bound on the gate count of such a simulation, showing that any quantum algorithm that can simulate a piecewise constant bounded local Hamiltonian in one dimension to constant error requires (sic) (nT) gates in the worst case. The lower bound holds even if we only require the output state to be correct on local measurements. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first nontrivial lower bound on the gate complexity of the simulation problem. Our algorithm is based on a decomposition of the time-evolution unitary into a product of small unitaries using Lieb-Robinson bounds. In the appendix, we prove a Lieb--Robinson bound tailored to Hamiltonians with small commutators between local terms, giving zero Lieb--Robinson velocity in the limit of commuting Hamiltonians. This improves the performance of our algorithm when the Hamiltonian is close to commuting.

TI Advanced Laser Technology for Quantum Communications (Tutorial Review)
SO ADVANCED QUANTUM TECHNOLOGIES
AB Quantum communications is the art of exchanging and manipulating information beyond the capabilities of the conventional technologies using the laws of quantum mechanics. With applications ranging from quantum computing to cryptographic systems with information-theoretic security, there is strong incentive to introduce quantum communications into many areas of the society. However, an important challenge is to develop viable technologies meeting the stringent requirements of low noise and high coherence for quantum state encoding, of high bit rate and low power for the integration with classical communication networks, and of scalable and low-cost production for a practical wide-deployment. This tutorial presents recent advances in laser modulation technologies that have enabled the development of efficient and versatile light sources for quantum communications, with a particular focus on quantum key distribution (QKD). Such approaches have been successfully used to demonstrate several QKD protocols with state-of-the-art performance. The applications and experimental results are reviewed and interpreted in the light of a complete theoretical background, allowing the reader to model and simulate such sources.

TI Protected two-qubit entangling gate with mechanical driven continuous
   dynamical decoupling
SO COMMUNICATIONS IN THEORETICAL PHYSICS
AB In this work, we propose a high-fidelity phonon-mediated entangling gate in a hybrid mechanical system based on two silicon-vacancy color centers in diamond. In order to suppress the influence of the spin decoherence on the entangling gate, we use a continuous dynamical decoupling approach to create new dressed spin states, which are less sensitive to environmental fluctuations and exhibit an extended T-2* spin dephasing time. The effective spin-spin Hamiltonian modified by the mechanical driving field and the corresponding master equation are derived in the dispersive regime. We show that in the presence of the mechanical driving field, the effective spin-spin coupling can be highly controlled. By calculating the entangling gate fidelity in the dressed basis, we find that once the mechanical field is turned on, the gate fidelity can be significantly improved. In particular, under an optimized spin-phonon detuning and a stronger Rabi frequency of the mechanical driving field, the two-qubit gate is capable of reaching fidelity exceeding 0.99. Moreover, by employing appropriate driving modulation, we show that a high-fidelity full quantum gate can be also realized, in which the initial and final spin states are on a bare basis. Our work provides a promising scheme for realizing high-fidelity quantum information processing.

SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB The scaling of the entanglement entropy at a quantum critical point allows us to extract universal properties of the state, e.g., the central charge of a conformal field theory. With the rapid improvement of noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices, these quantum computers present themselves as a powerful tool to study critical many-body systems. We use finite-depth quantum circuits suitable for NISQ devices as a variational ansatz to represent ground states of critical, infinite systems. We find universal finite-depth scaling relations for these circuits and verify them numerically at two different critical points, i.e., the critical Ising model with an additional symmetry-preserving term and the critical XXZ model.

TI A Review of Quantum Key Distribution Protocols in the Perspective of
   Smart Grid Communication Security
SO IEEE SYSTEMS JOURNAL
AB Smart grid depends on an advanced communication network to collect information from the power grid, and to disseminate control commands to the control devices. To safeguard the power grid, it is crucial to ensure information confidentiality in the communication networks. Quantum key distribution (QKD) protocols help in generating, and distributing secret keys between communication parties, and such secret keys are required in symmetric cryptography. The combination of QKD protocols, and symmetric cryptography are known to be unconditionally secure, which means information confidentiality can be guaranteed even against an eavesdropper, who has unlimited resources. This article provides a concise review of existing works on QKD protocols, and their applications in smart grid communications. Deploying QKD protocols in smart grid is challenging because distance between the control center, and control devices can be larger than the limits of existing protocols. Also, QKD protocols require an expensive quantum channel between each pair of sender, and receiver nodes, and there is large number of control devices with diverse capabilities in smart grid. We have classified existing works based on the challenges they have dealt with. Compared to the rich literature on QKD protocols in general, there are significantly fewer works in the specific context of smart grid. This can be an indication for opportunity to make a significant contribution. We have also identified a few research challenges that can be potential future works.

TI SL(2,C) Scheme Processing of Singularities in Quantum Computing and
   Genetics
SO AXIOMS
AB Revealing the time structure of physical or biological objects is usually performed thanks to the tools of signal processing such as the fast Fourier transform, Ramanujan sum signal processing, and many other techniques. For space-time topological objects in physics and biology, we propose a type of algebraic processing based on schemes in which the discrimination of singularities within objects is based on the space-time-spin group SL(2,C). Such topological objects possess an homotopy structure encoded in their fundamental group, and the related SL(2,C) multivariate polynomial character variety contains a plethora of singularities somehow analogous to the frequency spectrum in time structures. Our approach is applied to a model of quantum computing based on an Akbulut cork in exotic R4, to an hyperbolic model of topological quantum computing based on magic states and to microRNAs in genetics. Such diverse topics reveal the manifold of possibilities of using the concept of a scheme spectrum.

TI Macroscopic and deterministic quantum feature generation via phase basis
   quantization in a cascaded interferometric system
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB Quantum entanglement is the quintessence of quantum information science governed by quantum superposition mostly limited to a microscopic regime. For practical applications, however, macroscopic entanglement has an essential benefit for quantum sensing and metrology to beat its classical counterpart. Recently, a coherence approach for entanglement generation has been proposed and demonstrated in a coupled interferometric system using classical laser light, where the quantum feature of entanglement has been achieved via phase basis superposition between identical interferometric systems. Such a coherence method is based on the wave nature of a photon without violating quantum mechanics under the complementarity theory. Here, a method of phase basis quantization via phase basis superposition is presented for macroscopic entanglement in an interferometric system, which is corresponding to the energy quantization of a photon.

TI Multi-Channel Polarization Manipulation Based on All-Dielectric
   Metasurface
SO PHOTONICS
AB A metasurface is a planar structure that can be utilized to manipulate the amplitude, phase, and polarization of light on a subwavelength scale. Although a variety of functional optical devices based on metasurface have been proposed, the simultaneous transmission of different types of polarized waves has rarely been reported. The transmission of polarized waves with different types plays an important role in the fields of wavelength division multiplexing, quantum cryptography, and quantum computing. The simulated results in this work demonstrate that the independent manipulation of transmitted waves can be realized by the designed all-dielectric metasurface, and different types of polarized waves can be simultaneously generated. In addition, different optical responses under orthogonal circularly polarized wave incidences can be generated by this metasurface. The proposed method provides potential applications for the development of integrated optical quantum information transmission and the design of integrated optical systems on a chip.

TI Heralded interconversion between hyperentangled W state and
   hyperentangled KLM state assisted by nitrogen vacancy centers coupled
   with microresonators
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB As the hyperentanglement of photon systems holds lots of remarkable applications for enhancing channel capacity with less quantum resource, the interconversion of various hyperentangled states warrants in-depth investigation and becomes a vital work for quantum information technologies. Here we realize completely mutual conversions between spatial-polarization hyperentangled Knill-Laflamme-Milburn state and hyperentangled W state for three-photon systems, resorting to hyperparallel quantum control gates and the practical nonlinear interaction of nitrogen-vacancy centers coupled with whispering-gallery-mode microresonators. The hyperparallel quantum gates, i.e., hyperparallel controlled-not and controlled-swap gates, are fundamental prerequisites for realizing interconversions of two hyperentangled states in a deterministic way. The fidelities of these conversion processes are robust and their efficiencies are also high due to fewer nonlinear interactions and errors heralded by the response of detectors, which intensify comprehending the properties of hyperentanglement.

TI Classical state masking over a quantum channel

AB Transmission of classical information over a quantum state-dependent channel is considered, when the encoder can measure channel side information (CSI) and is required to mask information on the quantum channel state from the decoder. In this quantum setting, it is essential to conceal the CSI measurement as well. A regularized formula is derived for the masking equivocation region, and a full characterization is established for a class of measurement channels.

TI Quantum Nonlinear Spectroscopy via Correlations of Weak Faraday-Rotation
   Measurements
SO ADVANCED QUANTUM TECHNOLOGIES
AB The correlations of fluctuations are key to studying fundamental quantum physics and quantum many-body dynamics. They are also useful information for understanding and combating decoherence in quantum technology. Nonlinear spectroscopy and noise spectroscopy are powerful tools to characterize fluctuations, but they can access only very few among the many types of higher-order correlations. A systematic quantum sensing approach, called quantum nonlinear spectroscopy (QNS), is recently proposed for extracting arbitrary types and orders of time-ordered correlations, using sequential weak measurement via a spin quantum sensor. However, the requirement of a central spin as the quantum sensor limits the versatility of the QNS since usually a central spin interacts only with a small number of particles in proximity and the measurement of single spins needs stringent conditions. Here, the aim is to employ the polarization (a pseudo-spin) of a coherent light beam as a quantum sensor for QNS. After interacting with a target system (such as a transparent magnetic material), the small Faraday rotation of the linearly polarized light can be measured, which constitutes a weak measurement of the magnetization in the target system. Using a Mach-Zehnder interferometer with a designed phase shift, one can post-select the effects of the light-material interaction to be either a quantum evolution or a quantum measurement of the material magnetization. This way, the correlated difference photon counts of a certain number of measurement shots, each with a designated interference phase, can be made proportional to a certain type and order of correlations of the magnetic fluctuations in the material. The analysis of the signal-to-noise ratios shows that the second-order correlations are detectable in general under realistic conditions and higher-order correlations are significant when the correlation lengths of the fluctuations are comparable to the laser spot size (such as in systems near the critical points). Since the photon sensor can interact simultaneously with many particles and interferometry is a standard technique, this protocol of QNS is advantageous for studying quantum many-body systems.
   Quantum many-body systems can have a rich structure of high-order correlations. Conventional nonlinear spectroscopy can detect only a few types of correlation. A Faraday-rotation-based quantum sensing scheme is proposed to extract arbitrary types and orders of correlations, offering a new approach to studying quantum many-body physics. image

TI PDI-trityl dyads as photogenerated molecular spin qubit candidates
SO CHEMICAL SCIENCE
AB Owing to their potential applications in the field of quantum information science, photogenerated organic triplet-radical conjugates have attracted an increasing amount of attention recently. Typically, these compounds are composed of a chromophore appended to a stable radical. After initialisation of the system by photoexcitation, a highly spin-polarised quartet state may be generated, which serves as a molecular spin qubit candidate. Here, we investigate three perylene diimide (PDI)-based chromophore-radical systems with different phenylene linkers and radical counterparts by both optical spectroscopy and transient electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) techniques. Femtosecond transient absorption measurements demonstrate chromophore triplet state formation on a picosecond time scale for PDI-trityl dyads, while excited state deactivation is found to be slowed down considerably in a PDI-nitroxide analogue. The subsequent investigation of the coherent spin properties by transient EPR confirms quartet state formation by triplet-doublet spin mixing for all investigated dyads and the suitability of the two studied PDI-trityl dyads as spin qubit candidates. In particular, we show that using tetrathiaryl trityl as the radical counterpart, an intense spin polarisation is observed even at room temperature and quartet state coherence times of 3.0 mu s can be achieved at 80 K, which represents a considerable improvement compared to previously studied systems.

TI Reliability and Security Analysis of an Entanglement-Based QKD Protocol
   in a Dynamic Ground-to-UAV FSO Communications System
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB Quantum cryptography is a promising technology that achieves unconditional security, which is essential to a wide range of sensitive applications. In contrast to optical fiber, the free-space optical (FSO) link is efficiently used as a quantum channel without affecting the polarization of transmitted photons. However, the FSO link has several impairments, such as atmospheric turbulence and pointing errors, which affect the performance of the quantum channel. This paper proposes a quantum key distribution (QKD) scheme that uses a time-bin entanglement protocol over the FSO channel that suffers from various channel impairments. Due to the interest in unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and their usefulness for many social, internet-of-things (IoT), civil, and military applications, the proposed QKD-FSO system is integrated with the ground-to-UAV platform. Furthermore, variances in the position and orientation of the UAV are investigated using a tracking system. These variances are considered when evaluating the overall performance of the proposed integrated system. For this purpose, closed-form expressions are obtained for the system average symbol error rate (ASER) and outage probability. The Monte Carlo simulation is used to verify the validity of the proposed expressions. The system security is investigated assuming photon number splitting (PNS) attack. Moreover, the transmit power, time-bin number, and modulation order are optimized to maximize the raw and secret key rates. The results show that for 500 m link, ASER < 10(-1) and link outage probability < 10(-1) with tolerating boresight displacement up to 30 cm, the system should be configured at receiver's field-of-view > 22 mrad and signal-to-noise ratio > 7:5 dB which leads SNRth < 2:5 dB and raw key rate maximized by adjusting the number of time bins according to the received SNR.

TI Quantum gene regulatory networks
SO NPJ QUANTUM INFORMATION
AB In this work, we present a quantum circuit model for inferring gene regulatory networks (GRNs) from single-cell transcriptomic data. The model employs qubit entanglement to simulate interactions between genes, resulting in competitive performance and promising potential for further exploration. We applied our quantum GRN modeling approach to single-cell transcriptomic data from human lymphoblastoid cells, focusing on a small set of genes involved in innate immunity regulation. Our quantum circuit model successfully predicted the presence and absence of regulatory interactions between genes, while also estimating the strength of these interactions. We argue that the application of quantum computing in biology has the potential to provide a better understanding of single-cell GRNs by more effectively approaching the relationship between fully interconnected genes compared to conventional statistical methods such as correlation and regression. Our results encourage further investigation into the creation of quantum algorithms that utilize single-cell data, paving the way for future research into the intersection of quantum computing and biology.

For this, different factors are considered that could induce decoherence of photons, including the gravitational field of astrophysical bodies, the particle content in the interstellar medium, and the more local environment of the Solar System. The x-ray region of the spectrum is identified as the prime candidate to establish a quantum communication channel, although the optical and microwave bands could also enable communication across large distances. Finally, we discuss what could be expected from a quantum signal emitted by an extraterrestrial civilization, as well as the challenges for the receiver end of the channel to identify and interpret such signals.

AB A novel quantum-classical hybrid scheme is proposed to efficiently solve large-scale combinatorial optimization problems. The key concept is to introduce a Hamiltonian dynamics of the classical flux variables associated with the quantum spins of the transverse-field Ising model. Molecular dynamics of the classical fluxes can be used as a powerful preconditioner to sort out the frozen and ambivalent spins for quantum annealers. The performance and accuracy of our smooth hybridization in comparison to the standard classical algorithms (the tabu search and the simulated annealing) are demonstrated by employing the MAX-CUT and Ising spin-glass problems.

TI Uniformly decaying subspaces for error-mitigated quantum computation
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB We present a general condition to obtain subspaces that decay uniformly in a system governed by the Lindblad master equation and use them to perform error-mitigated quantum computation. The expectation values of dynamics encoded in such subspaces are unbiased estimators of noise-free expectation values. In analogy to the decoherence free subspaces which are left invariant by the action of Lindblad operators, we show that the uniformly decaying subspaces are left invariant (up to orthogonal terms) by the action of the dissipative part of the Lindblad equation. We apply our theory to a system of qubits and qudits undergoing relaxation with varying decay rates and show that such subspaces can be used to eliminate bias up to first-order variations in the decay rates without requiring full knowledge of noise. Since such a bias cannot be corrected through standard symmetry verification, our method can improve error mitigation in dual-rail qubits and, given partial knowledge of noise, can perform better than probabilistic error cancellation.

TI Efficient excited-state calculations for molecules based on contextual
   subspace method and symmetry optimizations
SO NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB Quantum computing methods for excited-state calculations remain underexplored in noisy intermediate-scale quantum hardware, despite their critical role in photochemistry and material science. Herein, we propose a resource-efficient framework that integrates the contextual subspace method with the variational quantum deflation algorithm to enable systematic excited-state calculations for molecules while reducing qubit requirements. On the basis of the numerical results, we find that it is unproblematic to utilize this combination in calculating the excited state to reduce qubits. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the implementation of a spin-conserving hardware-efficient ansatz, namely the N(theta x,theta y,theta z) block ansatz, allows exploitation of spin symmetry within the projected subspace, thereby achieving further reductions in computational resource demands. Compared to the commonly used RYRZ ansatz, using the N(theta x,theta y,theta z) ansatz can reduce the number of optimization iterations by up to three times at a similar circuit depth.

AB An on-chip multigrating device is proposed to interface single atoms and integrated photonic circuits, by guiding and focusing lasers to the area similar to 10 mu m above the chip for trapping, state manipulation, and readout of single rubidium atoms. For the optical dipole trap, two 850-nm laser beams are diffracted and overlapped to form the lattice of a single-atom dipole trap, with the diameter of the optical dipole trap being around 2.7 mu m. Similar gratings are designed for guiding a 780-nm probe laser to excite and also collect the fluorescence of Rb-87 atoms. Such a device provides a compact solution for future applications of single atoms, including the single-photon source, single-atom quantum register, and single-atom quantum sensor.

TI Quantum computing for quantum tunneling
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW D
AB We demonstrate how quantum field theory problems can be practically encoded by using a discretization of the field theory problem into a general Ising model, with the continuous field values being encoded into Ising spin chains. To illustrate the method, and as a simple proof of principle, we use a (hybrid) quantum annealer to recover the correct profile of the thin-wall tunnelling solution. This method is applicable to many nonperturbative problems.

TI Synergy between noisy quantum computers and scalable classical deep
   learning for quantum error mitigation
SO EPJ QUANTUM TECHNOLOGY
AB We investigate the potential of combining the computational power of noisy quantum computers and of classical scalable convolutional neural networks (CNNs). The goal is to accurately predict exact expectation values of parameterized quantum circuits representing the Trotter-decomposed dynamics of quantum Ising models. By incorporating (simulated) noisy expectation values alongside circuit structure information, our CNNs effectively capture the underlying relationships between circuit architecture and output behaviour, enabling, via transfer learning, also predictions for circuits with more qubits than those included in the training set. Notably, thanks to the quantum information, our CNNs succeed even when supervised learning based only on classical descriptors fails. Furthermore, they outperform a popular error mitigation scheme, namely, zero-noise extrapolation, demonstrating that the synergy between quantum and classical computational tools leads to higher accuracy compared with quantum-only or classical-only approaches. By tuning the noise strength, we explore the crossover from a computationally powerful classical CNN assisted by quantum noisy data, towards rather precise quantum computations, further error-mitigated via classical deep learning.

AB Quantum networks emerge as fundamental frameworks for addressing various large-scale problems. There are two primary architectures: space-based quantum networks, which deploy satellites with free space channels to interconnect users, and ground-based quantum networks, which utilize optical fibers to interconnect users. In this paper, we explore space-ground integrated quantum networks that incorporate both satellites and optical fibers into the infrastructure. This integrated network features three forms of communication: using only free space links, only ground links, or a hybrid usage of free space and ground links. We formulate the routing problem in space-ground integrated quantum networks as an integer programming and propose two solutions: using linear relaxation or a greedy algorithm. The linear relaxation method allows timely scheduling of additional entanglement purification, whereas the greedy method enables quick scheduling. Simulation results demonstrate their effective balancing between network throughput and communication fidelity.

TI Geodesic algorithm for unitary gate design with time-independent
   Hamiltonians
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Larger multiqubit quantum gates allow shallower, more efficient quantum circuits, which could decrease the prohibitive effect of noise on algorithms for noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices and fault-tolerant error correction schemes. Such multiqubit gates can potentially be generated by time-independent Hamiltonians comprising only physical (one- and two-local) interaction terms. Here, we present an algorithm that finds the time-independent Hamiltonian for a target quantum gate on n qubits by using the geodesic on the Riemannian manifold of SU(2n). Differential programming is used to determine how the Hamiltonian should be updated to follow the geodesic to the target unitary as closely as possible. We show that our geodesic algorithm outperforms gradient descent methods for standard multiqubit gates such as Toffoli and Fredkin. The geodesic algorithm is then used to find previously unavailable multiqubit gates implementing high-fidelity parity checks, which could be used in a wide array of quantum codes and increase the clock speed of fault-tolerant quantum computers. The geodesic algorithm is demonstrated on an example relevant to current experimental hardware, illustrating a circuit speed up.

TI Using Spectral Graph Theory to Map Qubits onto Connectivity-limited
   Devices
SO ACM TRANSACTIONS ON QUANTUM COMPUTING
AB We propose an efficient heuristic for mapping the logical qubits of quantum algorithms to the physical qubits of connectivity-limited devices, adding a minimal number of connectivity-compliant SWAP gates. In particular, given a quantum circuit, we construct an undirected graph with edge weights a function of the two-qubit gates of the quantum circuit. Taking inspiration from spectral graph drawing, we use an eigenvector of the graph Laplacian to place logical qubits at coordinate locations. These placements are then mapped to physical qubits for a given connectivity. We primarily focus on one-dimensional connectivities and sketch how the general principles of our heuristic can be extended for use in more general connectivities.

TI Optimized Surface Ion Trap Design for Tight Confinement and Separation
   of Ion Chains
SO QUANTUM REPORTS
AB Qubit systems based on trapped ultracold ions win one of the leading positions in the quantum computing field, demonstrating quantum algorithms with the highest complexity to date. Surface Paul traps for ion confinement open the opportunity to scale quantum processors to hundreds of qubits and enable high-connectivity manipulations on ions. To fabricate such a system with certain characteristics, the special design of a surface electrode structure is required. The depth of the trapping potential, the stability parameter, the secular frequency and the distance between an ion and the trap surface should be optimized for better performance. Here, we present the optimized design of a relatively simple surface trap that allows several important high-fidelity primitives: tight ion confinement, laser cooling, and wide optical access. The suggested trap design also allows us to perform an important basic operation, namely, splitting an ion chain into two parts.

TI Informationally restricted correlations: a general framework for
   classical and quantum systems
SO QUANTUM
AB We introduce new methods and tools to study and characterise classical and quantum correlations emerging from prepare-and measure experiments with informationally restricted communication. We consider the most general kind of informationally restricted correlations, namely the ones formed when the sender is allowed to prepare statistical mixtures of mixed states, showing that contrary to what happens in Bell nonlocality, mixed states can outperform pure ones. We then leverage these tools to derive device-independent witnesses of the information content of quantum communication, witnesses for different quantum information resources, and demonstrate that these methods can be used to develop a new avenue for semi-device independent random number generators.

TI Robotic Vectorial Field Alignment for Spin-Based Quantum Sensors
SO ADVANCED SCIENCE
AB Developing practical quantum technologies will require the exquisite manipulation of fragile systems in a robust and repeatable way. As quantum technologies move toward real world applications, from biological sensing to communication in space, increasing experimental complexity introduces constraints that can be alleviated by the introduction of new technologies. Robotics has shown tremendous progress in realizing increasingly smart, autonomous, and highly dexterous machines. Here, a robotic arm equipped with a magnet is demonstrated to sensitize an NV center quantum magnetometer in challenging conditions unachievable with standard techniques. Vector magnetic fields are generated with 1 degrees angular and 0.1 mT amplitude accuracy and determine the orientation of a single stochastically-aligned spin-based sensor in a constrained physical environment. This work opens up the prospect of integrating robotics across many quantum degrees of freedom in constrained settings, allowing for increased prototyping speed, control, and robustness in quantum technology applications.
   Robotic arms consist of sets of links that allow arbitrary positioning and orientation of an end tool. This study shows such a technique can be used to align vector spin-based quantum sensors with high accuracy by positioning a permanent magnet. The flexibility demonstrated is important for emerging quantum sensing applications in physically constrained environments.image

AB As the popularity of quantum computing continues to grow, quantum machine access over the cloud is critical to both academic and industry researchers across the globe. And as cloud quantum computing demands increase exponentially, the analysis of resource consumption and execution characteristics are key to efficient management of jobs and resources at both the vendorend as well as the client-end. While the analysis of resource consumption and management are popular in the classical HPC domain, it is severely lacking for more nascent technology like quantum computing.
   This paper is a first-of-its-kind academic study, analyzing various trends in job execution and resources consumption / utilization on quantum cloud systems. We focus on IBM Quantum systems and analyze characteristics over a two year period, encompassing over 6000 jobs which contain over 600,000 quantum circuit executions and correspond to almost 10 billion "shots" or trials over 20+ quantum machines. Specifically, we analyze trends focused on, but not limited to, execution times on quantum machines, queuing/waiting times in the cloud, circuit compilation times, machine utilization, as well as the impact of job and machine characteristics on all of these trends. Our analysis identifies several similarities and differences with classical HPC cloud systems. Based on our insights, we make recommendations and contributions to improve the management of resources and jobs on future quantum cloud systems.

TI Nearly Optimal Quantum Algorithm for Estimating Multiple Expectation
   Values
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB Many quantum algorithms involve the evaluation of expectation values. Optimal strategies for estimating a single expectation value are known, requiring a number of state preparations that scales with the target error e as O(1=e thorn . In this Letter, we address the task of estimating the expectation values of M different observables, each to within additive error e, with the same 1=e dependence. We describe an approach that leverages Gilyen et al.'s quantum gradient estimation algorithm to achieve O( p =e thorn scaling up to ffiffiffiffiM logarithmic factors, regardless of the commutation properties of the M observables. We prove that this scaling is worst-case optimal in the high-precision regime if the state preparation is treated as a black box, even when the operators are mutually commuting. We highlight the flexibility of our approach by presenting several generalizations, including a strategy for accelerating the estimation of a collection of dynamic correlation functions.

TI Secure multiparty quantum key agreement against collusive attacks
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB Quantum key agreement enables remote participants to fairly establish a secure shared key based on their private inputs. In the circular-type multiparty quantum key agreement mode, two or more malicious participants can collude together to steal private inputs of honest participants or to generate the final key alone. In this work, we focus on a powerful collusive attack strategy in which two or more malicious participants in particular positions, can learn sensitive information or generate the final key alone without revealing their malicious behaviour. Many of the current circular-type multiparty quantum key agreement protocols are not secure against this collusive attack strategy. As an example, we analyze the security of a recently proposed multiparty key agreement protocol to show the vulnerability of existing circular-type multiparty quantum key agreement protocols against this collusive attack. Moreover, we design a general secure multiparty key agreement model that would remove this vulnerability from such circular-type key agreement protocols and describe the necessary steps to implement this model. The proposed model is general and does not depend on the specific physical implementation of the quantum key agreement.

TI Deterministic algorithms for compiling quantum circuits with recurrent
   patterns
SO QUANTUM INFORMATION PROCESSING
AB Current quantum processors are noisy and have limited coherence and imperfect gate implementations. On such hardware, only algorithms that are shorter than the overall coherence time can be implemented and executed successfully. A good quantum compiler must translate an input program into the most efficient equivalent of itself, getting the most out of the available hardware. In this work, we present novel deterministic algorithms for compiling recurrent quantum circuit patterns in polynomial time. In particular, such patterns appear in quantum circuits that are used to compute the ground-state properties of molecular systems using the variational quantum eigensolver method together with the RyRz heuristic wavefunction Ansatz. We show that our pattern-oriented compiling algorithms, combined with an efficient swapping strategy, produces-in general-output programs that are comparable to those obtained with state-of-the-art compilers, in terms of CNOT count and CNOT depth. In particular, our solution produces unmatched results on RyRz circuits.

TI Magnetic-Gradient-Free Two-Axis Control of a Valley Spin Qubit in
   SixGe1-x
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW APPLIED
AB Spins in SixGe1-x quantum dots are promising candidates for quantum bits but are also challenging due to the valley degeneracy and weak spin-orbital coupling. In this work, we demonstrate that valley states can serve as an asset that enables full two-axis control of a singlet-triplet qubit formed in a double quantum dot. We measure the valley spectrum in each dot using magnetic field spectroscopy of Zeeman split triplet states. We find a finite probability of valley states to flip during interdot transitions, which in turn provides a g-factor difference Ag between two dots. This Ag serves as an effective magnetic field gradient and allows for qubit rotations with a rate that increases linearly with an external magnetic field. We measure several interdot transitions and find that this valley-introduced Ag is universal and electrically tunable. This could potentially simplify the scaling up of quantum information processing in the SixGe1-x platform by removing the requirement for magnetic field gradients, which are difficult to engineer.

TI AN ALGEBRAIC QUANTUM CIRCUIT COMPRESSION ALGORITHM FOR HAMILTONIAN
   SIMULATION
SO SIAM JOURNAL ON MATRIX ANALYSIS AND APPLICATIONS
AB Quantum computing is a promising technology that harnesses the peculiarities of quantum mechanics to deliver computational speedups for some problems that are intractable to solve on a classical computer. Current generation noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) com-puters are severely limited in terms of chip size and error rates. Shallow quantum circuits with uncomplicated topologies are essential for successful applications in the NISQ era. Based on matrix analysis, we derive localized circuit transformations to efficiently compress quantum circuits for sim-ulation of certain spin Hamiltonians known as free fermions. The depth of the compressed circuits is independent of simulation time and grows linearly with the number of spins. The proposed nu-merical circuit compression algorithm behaves backward stable and scales cubically in the number of spins enabling circuit synthesis beyond O(10(3)) spins. The resulting quantum circuits have a simple nearest-neighbor topology, which makes them ideally suited for NISQ devices.

TI Quantum features of gravcats
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB We explore the quantum features of two gravitational cats (gravcats) modeled by two qubits, focusing on quantum steerability, concurrence, and geometric quantum discord under varying conditions of gravitational interaction strength, temperature, and excitation energy. We first analyze the system without dephasing effects, revealing that two-way quantum steering occurs at lower temperatures and higher gravitational interaction strengths. As temperature increases, thermal noise reduces steerability, though gravitational effects remain significant, indicating a non-monotonic behavior dependent on energy and mass scales. Furthermore, quantum correlations exhibit a hierarchy, with geometric quantum discord persisting even when steering and entanglement vanish. We then explore the impact of environmental dephasing and classical correlations on the system's dynamics. Our findings demonstrate that classical correlations in correlated dephasing channels can protect quantum resources, enhancing their stability in both Markovian and non-Markovian regimes. This work highlights the intricate interplay between gravitational interactions, thermal effects, and environmental noise in preserving quantum resources.

TI The challenge and opportunities of quantum literacy for future education
   and transdisciplinary problem-solving
SO RESEARCH IN SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGICAL EDUCATION
AB Background: Knowledge of quantum computing is arguably inaccessible to many, with knowledge of the complex mathematics involving a particular barrier to entry, creating difficulty in terms of teaching and inclusive learning for those without a high level of mathematics. Meanwhile, it is increasingly important that the knowledge of quantum technologies is accessible to those who work with real-world applications and is taught to the younger generation. Purpose: Resulting from collaborative dialogue between physicists, computer scientists, educationalists, and industrial end users, we propose the concept of quantum literacy as one means of addressing the need for transdisciplinary research in response to the complex problems that we see at the heart of issues around global sustainability. In this way, quantum literacy can contribute to UN Sustainable Development Goal 4, Quality Education. Methods: We introduce a specific puzzle visualization learning tool through which to achieve the pedagogic ends we set out with respect to quantum literacy. Visualization through puzzles can enable non-specialists to develop an intuitive, but still rigorous, understanding of universal quantum computation and provide a facility for non-specialists to discover increasingly complex and new quantum algorithms. Using the Hong-Ou-Mandel optical effect from quantum mechanics, we demonstrate how visual methods such as those made possible through the puzzle visualization tool can be very useful for understanding underlying complex processes in quantum physics and beyond and therefore support the aims of quantum literacy. Conclusion: We argue that quantum literacy, as defined here, addresses the challenges of learning within a highly bounded discipline and of access to the kind of powerful knowledge that should be more accessible to a wide group of learners. We therefore argue for the importance of addressing pedagogic issues when powerful knowledge consists of dense concepts, as well as complex and hierarchical relations between concepts, in addition to presenting a strong barrier to entry in the form of mathematics.

AB The learning process of classical machine learning algorithms is tuned by hyperparameters that need to be customized to best learn and generalize from an input dataset. In recent years, Quantum Machine Learning (QML) has been gaining traction as a possible application of quantum computing which may provide quantum advantage in the future. However, quantum versions of classical machine learning algorithms introduce a plethora of additional parameters and circuit variations that have their own intricacies in being tuned.
   In this work, we take the first steps towards Automated Quantum Machine Learning (AutoQML). We propose a concrete description of the problem, and then develop a classical-quantum hybrid cloud architecture that allows for parallelized hyperparameter exploration and model training.
   As an application use-case, we train a quantum Generative Adversarial neural Network (qGAN) to generate energy prices that follow a known historic data distribution. Such a QML model can be used for various applications in the energy economics sector.

TI Performance comparison of quantum-safe multivariate polynomial public
   key encapsulation algorithm
SO EURASIP JOURNAL ON INFORMATION SECURITY
AB A novel quantum-safe key encapsulation algorithm, called Multivariate Polynomial Public Key (MPPK), was recently proposed by Kuang, Perepechaenko, and Barbeau. Security of the MPPK key encapsulation mechanism does not rely on the prime factorization or discrete logarithm problems. It builds upon the NP-completeness of the modular Diophantine equation problem, for which there are no known efficient classical or quantum algorithms. Hence, it is resistant to known quantum computing attacks. The private key of MPPK comprises a pair of multivariate polynomials. In a companion paper, we analyzed the performance of MPPK when these polynomials are quadratic. The analysis highlighted the MPPK high decapsulation time. We found that, while maintaining the security strength, the polynomials can be linear. Considerable performance gains are obtained for the decapsulation process. In this article, we benchmark the linear case and compare the results with the previous quadratic case.

TI AI image enhancement for failure analysis in 3D quantum information
   technology
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB 3D integration and miniaturization techniques get more widely used in conventional integrated circuits but also represent crucial ingredients for future quantum computing devices. This consolidates the need for efficiently detecting increasingly small defects on wafer size. Here we present a time-efficient and accurate way of measuring, localizing and statistically classifying defects down to the micrometer regime, utilizing a combination of scanning acoustic microscopy (SAM), You Only Look Once object detection, semantic segmentation and a machine learning super-resolution (ML-SR) approach. In particular, we test the capabilities of different ML-SR approaches to enable self-supervised quality enhancement of the measured image data. We reveal that the developed AI-powered workflow enhances time-efficiency by a factor of around 4x and 6x for the TSV and delamination analysis, respectively. Yet, the mentioned approach is not limited to SAM image data but presents a general way for speeding-up failure analysis in various fields.

TI Computation-efficient quantum convolutional neural networks for
   autonomous driving applications
SO JOURNAL OF SUPERCOMPUTING
AB This paper proposes a computation-efficient quantum convolutional neural network (CE-QCNN) architecture designed for autonomous driving applications. A key contribution of this work lies in the formulation of a tri-value qubit encoding (TQE) scheme, which compactly embeds three-channel RGB image data into single-qubit states via a sequence of quantum rotations. This strategy enables significant qubit resource reduction while preserving the representational richness of multi-channel visual inputs. The encoded quantum states are subsequently processed through parameterized quantum circuits for convolutional feature extraction, forming the core of the proposed CE-QCNN framework. To further improve learning stability and early-stage performance, a knowledge distillation (KD) strategy is employed, transferring supervision from a pretrained classical CNN model to the quantum network. The proposed model is evaluated on the KITTI dataset, a standard benchmark for autonomous driving, where it demonstrates both competitive detection accuracy and reduced computational complexity. These results substantiate the scalability and practical applicability of CE-QCNNs for future quantum-enhanced perception systems in real-time autonomous driving scenarios.

TI GASP: a genetic algorithm for state preparation on quantum computers
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB The efficient preparation of quantum states is an important step in the execution of many quantum algorithms. In the noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) computing era, this is a significant challenge given quantum resources are scarce and typically only low-depth quantum circuits can be implemented on physical devices. We present a genetic algorithm for state preparation (GASP) which generates relatively low-depth quantum circuits for initialising a quantum computer in a specified quantum state. The method uses a basis set of R-X, R-y, R-Z, and CNOT gates and a genetic algorithm to systematically generate circuits to synthesize the target state to the required fidelity. GASP can produce more efficient circuits of a given accuracy with lower depth and gate counts than other methods. This variability of the required accuracy facilitates overall higher accuracy on implementation, as error accumulation in high-depth circuits can be avoided. We directly compare the method to the state initialisation technique based on an exact synthesis technique by implemented in IBM Qiskit simulated with noise and implemented on physical IBM Quantum devices. Results achieved by GASP outperform Qiskit's exact general circuit synthesis method on a variety of states such as Gaussian states and W-states, and consistently show the method reduces the number of gates required for the quantum circuits to generate these quantum states to the required accuracy.

TI PP-PQB: Privacy-Preserving in Post-Quantum Blockchain-Based Systems: A
   Systematization of Knowledge
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB Blockchain technology has produced effective solutions and provides security by using cryptographic tools for various applications, attracting attention from the academic community. Therefore, researchers have taken advantage of the features of blockchain technology to increase the security of the ecosystem. Recently, as the existence of quantum computers has been felt, researchers have started to benefit from post-quantum cryptography to increase privacy and security. There has been an increase in data and asset protection in post-quantum blockchain-based solutions. To the best of our knowledge, there is no comprehensive review or taxonomy that provides a complete picture of post-quantum secure structures with privacy-preserving techniques that have the potential to be used in blockchain. This paper aims to close this gap by systematically examining these approaches and revealing the deficiencies in the existing literature and the development potential in these areas. The taxonomy examines the role of blockchain technology in post-quantum cryptography and emphasizes the potential of technologies such as zero-knowledge proof to ensure privacy in post-quantum blockchain-based systems. We also review the existing literature on addressing the performance overhead, interoperability, scalability, and security challenges in implementing post-quantum cryptography in zero-knowledge proof-enabled blockchain architectures that protect against quantum computing threats. The studies are collected from journal papers in widely used academic databases between 2018 and 2024. The studies are subjected to certain elimination criteria, and 13 studies are reviewed in detail. Our approach will facilitate discussions on future research directions by proposing the accessibility of post-quantum cryptography against quantum threats to blockchain systems and solutions to the challenges that arise in the integration phase.

TI Fast and converged classical simulations of evidence for the utility of
   quantum computing before fault tolerance
SO SCIENCE ADVANCES
AB A recent quantum simulation of observables of the kicked Ising model on 127 qubits implemented circuits that exceed the capabilities of exact classical simulation. We show that several approximate classical methods, based on sparse Pauli dynamics and tensor network algorithms, can simulate these observables orders of magnitude faster than the quantum experiment and can also be systematically converged beyond the experimental accuracy. Our most accurate technique combines a mixed Schrodinger and Heisenberg tensor network representation with the Bethe free entropy relation of belief propagation to compute expectation values with an effective wave function-operator sandwich bond dimension >16,000,000, achieving an absolute accuracy, without extrapolation, in the observables of <0.01, which is converged for many practical purposes. We thereby identify inaccuracies in the experimental extrapolations and suggest how future experiments can be implemented to increase the classical hardness.

TI Do maximally entangled states always have an advantage over
   non-maximally entangled states in Schwarzschild black hole?
SO EUROPEAN PHYSICAL JOURNAL C
AB It is generally believed that quantum entanglement in the maximally entangled states is greater than quantum entanglement in the non-maximally entangled states under a relativistic setting. In this paper, we study quantum entanglement for four different types of Bell-like states of the fermionic modes near the event horizon of a Schwarzschild black hole. It is interesting to find that quantum entanglement in the maximally entangled states is less than quantum entanglement in the non-maximally entangled states in Schwarzschild spacetime. From the perspective of quantum resources, the non-maximally entangled states may have more advantages in curved spacetime compared to the maximally entangled states. This is obviously different from the conclusions in previous paper. For two types of Bell-like states, quantum entanglement suffers sudden death under the Hawking effect of the black hole, and for the other two types of Bell-like states, quantum entanglement can exist forever regardless of the Hawking temperature. Therefore, we should choose appropriate types of Bell-like states to handle relativistic quantum information tasks.

TI Metropolitan Quantum-Drone Networking and Computing: A Software-Defined
   Perspective
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB Swarms of drones are utilized in a wide range of applications, considering that they can be deployed on-demand and are economically affordable. Furthermore, they can also have a significant role in the creation of future Quantum Networks (QNs). As a matter of fact, the use of drones allows deploying a non terrestrial Quantum Metropolitan Area Network (QMAN), overcoming Optical Fibers' (OFs) limits, due to the large percentage of photons that scatters before reaching the receiver. However, random fluctuations of drones' positions and atmospheric turbulence can affect the quality of the Free Space Optic (FSO) link with a significant impact on performance. Considering that Quantum Drone Networks (QDNs) require significant control, Software-Defined Networking (SDN) paradigm can play a key role in their provisioning. Specifically, an SDN Controller is responsible for managing the global strategies for the distribution of end-to-end (E2E) entangled pairs. Therefore, this paper provides the design of an SDN-based architecture for supporting high-performance Metropolitan Quantum Drone Networks (MQDNs) with a specific protocol for creating entanglement between two Ground Stations (GSs) through the swarm of drones. The proposed architecture can be employed for distributed quantum computing applications and entanglement-based Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) services. Moreover, a suited objective function to optimize the planning and operation of the swarm mission has been proposed. Finally, the paper provides a performance evaluation considering the most relevant metrics, such as fidelity, entanglement rate, and the overhead of the proposed protocol, pointing out that even higher performance than OFs is achievable.

TI Enhancing adversarial robustness of quantum neural networks by adding
   noise layers
SO NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB The rapid advancements in machine learning and quantum computing have given rise to a new research frontier: quantum machine learning. Quantum models designed for tackling classification problems possess the potential to deliver speed enhancements and superior predictive accuracy compared to their classical counterparts. However, recent research has revealed that quantum neural networks (QNNs), akin to their classical deep neural network-based classifier counterparts, are vulnerable to adversarial attacks. In these attacks, meticulously designed perturbations added to clean input data can result in QNNs producing incorrect predictions with high confidence. To mitigate this issue, we suggest enhancing the adversarial robustness of quantum machine learning systems by incorporating noise layers into QNNs. This is accomplished by solving a Min-Max optimization problem to control the magnitude of the noise, thereby increasing the QNN's resilience against adversarial attacks. Extensive numerical experiments illustrate that our proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art defense techniques in terms of both clean and robust accuracy.

TI Quantum Thermodynamic Advantage in Work Extraction from Steerable
   Quantum Correlations
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB Inspired by the primary goal of quantum thermodynamics-to characterize quantum signatures and leverage their benefits in thermodynamic scenarios-we design a work extraction task within a bipartite framework that exhibits a quantum thermodynamic advantage. The steerability of quantum correlations between the two parties is the key resource enabling such an advantage. In designing the task, we exploit the correspondence between steerability and the incompatibility of observables. Our work extraction protocol involves mutually unbiased bases, which exhibit maximum incompatibility and therefore maximum steerability, showcased in maximally entangled quantum states. The work extraction protocols consist of quenches and thermalization processes, which serve as fundamental building blocks for various thermodynamic protocols, such as heat engines. We derive upper bounds on the extractable work for unsteerable and steerable correlations and devise a protocol that saturates the latter. The ratio between the extractable work in steerable and unsteerable scenarios, which encapsulates the quantum advantage, increases with the dimension of the underlying system (sometimes referred to as an unbounded advantage). This proves a quantum thermodynamic advantage arising from steerable quantum correlations.

AB Ultracold atoms in optical lattices are a powerful tool for quantum simulation, precise measurement, and quantum computation. A fundamental problem in applying this quantum system is how to manipulate the higher bands or orbitals in Bloch states effectively. Here we mainly review our methods for manipulating high orbital ultracold atoms in optical lattices with different configurations. Based on these methods, we construct the atom-orbital qubit under nonadiabatic holonomic quantum control and Ramsey interferometry with trapped motional quantum states. Then we review the observation of the novel quantum states and the study of the dynamical evolution of the high orbital atoms in optical lattices. The effective manipulation of the high orbitals provides strong support for applying ultracold atoms in the optical lattice in many fields.

Specifically, our approach leverages quantum annealers, providing high-quality solutions to instances of quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO) problems quickly. We show how to transform data allocation instances into equivalent QUBO instances. Also, we analyze the number of qubits needed to represent the resulting instances. More precisely, we determine the asymptotic number of required qubits as a function of the dimensions of the input problem. Our analysis takes into account different annealer topologies, ranging from fully connected qubits to sparse connection structures. Finally, we outline future work for this project.

TI All-optical quantum information processing via a single-step Rydberg
   blockade gate
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB One of the critical elements in the realization of the quantum internet are deterministic two-photon gates. This CZ photonic gate also completes a set of universal gates for all-optical quantum information processing. This article discusses an approach to realize a high fidelity CZ photonic gate by storing both control and target photons within an atomic ensemble using non-Rydberg electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT) followed by a fast, single-step Rydberg excitation with global lasers. The proposed scheme operates by relative intensity modulation of two lasers used in Rydberg excitation. Circumventing the conventional pi-gap-pi schemes, the proposed operation features continuous laser protection of the Rydberg atoms from the environment noise. The complete spatial overlap of stored photons inside the blockade radius optimizes the optical depth and simplifies the experiment. The coherent operation here is performed in the region that was dissipative in the previous Rydberg EIT schemes. Encountering the main imperfection sources, i.e., the spontaneous emission of the Rydberg and intermediate levels, population rotation errors, Doppler broadening of the transition lines, storage/retrieval efficiency, and atomic thermal motion induced decoherence, this article concludes that with realistic experimental parameters 99.7% fidelity is achievable.(c) 2023 Optica Publishing Group under the terms of the Optica Open Access Publishing Agreement

TI Accurate and gate-efficient quantum Ansätze for electronic states
   without adaptive optimization
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB The ability of quantum computers to overcome the exponential memory scaling of many -body problems is expected to transform quantum chemistry. Quantum algorithms require accurate representations of electronic states on a quantum device, but current approximations struggle to combine chemical accuracy and gate efficiency while preserving physical symmetries, and rely on measurement -intensive adaptive methods that tailor the wave function Ansatz to each molecule. In this contribution, we present a symmetry -preserving and gate -efficient Ansatz that provides chemically accurate molecular energies with a well-defined circuit structure. Our approach exploits local qubit connectivity, orbital optimization, and connections with generalized valence bond theory to maximize the accuracy that is obtained with shallow quantum circuits. Numerical simulations for molecules with weak and strong electron correlation, including benzene, water, and the singlet -triplet gap in tetramethyleneethane, demonstrate that chemically accurate energies are achieved with as much as 84% fewer two-qubit gates compared to state-of-the-art adaptive Ansatz techniques.

AB This letter presents a cryogenic digital-to-analog converter (DAC) for controlling qubits in a large-scale quantum computer. The capacitor arrays composing a charge-redistribution DAC are miniaturized by effectively utilizing the cryogenic characteristics of extremely low noise and leakage. Furthermore, capacitor mismatches due to their small size are automatically corrected by a newly proposed calibration technique with a small area-overhead. Fabricated in 40 nm CMOS and measured at cryogenic temperature, the prototype 11-bit DAC achieved a very small area of 0.3 mm(2) and low power consumption of 5.8 mu W, while realizing a non-linearity error within +/-2 LSB.

TI Inverted many-body mobility edge in a central qudit problem
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
AB Many interesting experimental systems, such as cavity QED or central spin models, involve global coupling to a single harmonic mode. Out of equilibrium, it remains unclear under what conditions localized phases survive such global coupling. We study energy-dependent localization in the disordered Ising model with transverse and longitudinal fields coupled globally to a d-level system (qudit). Strikingly, we discover evidence for an inverted mobility edge where high-energy states are localized whereas low-energy states are delocalized. This prediction is supported by shift-and-invert eigenstate targeting and Krylov time evolution up to L = 13 and 18, respectively. We argue for a critical energy of the localization phase transition which scales as E-c proportional to L-1/2, consistent with finite-size numerics. We also show evidence for a reentrant many-body localization phase at even lower energies despite the presence of strong effects of the central mode in this regime. Similar results should occur in the central spin-S problem at large S and in certain models of cavity QED.

TI Block encodings of discrete subgroups on a quantum computer
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW D
AB We introduce a block encoding method for mapping discrete subgroups to qubits on a quantum computer. This method is applicable to general discrete groups, including crystal-like subgroups such as BI of SU(2) and V of SU ( 3 ) . We detail the construction of primitive gates-the inversion gate, the group multiplication gate, the trace gate, and the group Fourier gate-utilizing this encoding method for BT and for the first time BI group. We also provide resource estimations to extract the gluon viscosity. The inversion gates for BT and BI are benchmarked on the Baiwang quantum computer with estimated fidelities of 405-4% and 4 5 -3 %, respectively.

TI Controlled gate networks: theory and application to eigenvalue
   estimation
SO EUROPEAN PHYSICAL JOURNAL A
AB We introduce a new scheme for quantum circuit design called controlled gate networks. Rather than trying to reduce the complexity of individual unitary operations, the new strategy is to toggle between all of the unitary operations needed with the fewest number of gates. We present the general theory of controlled gate networks and show that, under quite general conditions, it can significantly reduce the number of two-qubit gates needed to produce linear combinations of unitary operators. The first example we consider is a variational subspace calculation for a two-qubit system. The second example is estimating the eigenvalues of a two-qubit Hamiltonian via the rodeo algorithm (Choi et al. in Phys Rev Lett 127(4):040505, 2021. https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevLett.127.040505) using operators that we call controlled reversal gates. We use the Quantinuum H1-2 and IBM Perth devices to realize the quantum circuits. The third example is the application of controlled gate networks to the controlled time evolution of a free nucleon on a three-dimensional lattice. For all of the examples, we show very substantial reductions in the number of two-qubit gates required. Our work demonstrates that controlled gate networks are a useful tool for reducing gate complexity in quantum algorithms for quantum many-body problems such as those relevant to nuclear physics.

TI Application of Quantum Computers and Their Unique Properties for
   Constrained Optimization in Engineering Problems: Welded Beam Design
SO ELECTRONICS
AB The welded beam design problem represents a real-world engineering challenge in structural optimization. The objective is to determine the optimal dimensions of a steel beam and weld length to minimize cost while satisfying constraints related to shear stress (tau), bending stress (sigma), critical buckling load (Pc), end deflection (delta), and side constraints. The structural analysis of this problem involves the following four design variables: weld height (x1), weld length (x2), beam thickness (x3), and beam width (x4), which are commonly denoted in structural engineering as h,l,t,b respectively. The structural formulation of this problem leads to a nonlinear objective function, which is subject to five nonlinear and two linear inequality constraints. The optimal solution lies on the boundary of the feasible region, with a very small feasible-to-search-space ratio, making it a highly challenging problem for classical optimization algorithms. This paper explores the application of quantum computing to solve the welded beam optimization problem, utilizing the unique properties of quantum computers for constrained optimization in engineering problems. Specifically, we employ the D-Wave quantum computing system, which utilizes quantum annealing and is particularly well-suited for solving constrained optimization problems. The study presents a detailed formulation of the problem in a format compatible with the D-Wave system, ensuring the efficient encoding of constraints and objective functions. Furthermore, we analyze the performance of quantum computing in solving this problem and compare the obtained results with classical optimization methods. The effectiveness of quantum computing is evaluated in terms of computational efficiency, accuracy, and its ability to navigate complex, constrained search spaces. This research highlights the potential of quantum algorithms in tackling real-world engineering optimization problems and discusses the challenges and limitations of current quantum hardware in solving practical industrial application issues.

TI Fault-tolerant resource estimate for quantum chemical simulations: Case
   study on Li-ion battery electrolyte molecules
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB We estimate the resources required in the fusion-based quantum computing scheme to simulate electrolyte molecules in Li-ion batteries on a fault-tolerant, photonic quantum computer. We focus on the molecules that can provide practical solutions to industrially relevant problems. Certain fault-tolerant operations require the use of single-qubit "magic states" prepared by dedicated "magic state factories" (MSFs). Producing and consuming magic states in parallel is typically a prohibitively expensive task, resulting in the serial application of fault-tolerant gates. However, for the systems considered, the MSF constitutes a negligible fraction of the total footprint of the quantum computer, allowing for the use of multiple MSFs to produce magic states in parallel. We suggest architectural and algorithmic techniques that can accommodate such a capability. We propose a method to consume multiple magic states simultaneously, which can potentially lead to an order of magnitude reduction in the computational runtime without additional expense in the footprint.

AB Quantum sensing is broadly defined as the use of quantum materials, quantum coherence, and/or quantum entanglement to measure physical quantities and/or to enhance the sensitivity of classical analytical measurements. Certain materials exhibit interesting quantum properties that have the potential to be utilized in quantum sensing applications. One such quantum property is electronic spin, which is utilized in this work. Here, we built a custom apparatus capable of conducting both optically detected magnetic resonance (ODMR) and spin relaxometry. The quantum material investigated was an ensemble of nitrogen vacancies (NV) in nanodiamonds. We have characterized the system and measured ODMR spectra at different applied DC magnetic fields and observed the expected splitting of the resonances due the Zeeman effect. We also have measured the spin relaxation times for two different powers of the applied AC magnetic field. The lower power dataset exhibited expected exponential temporal dependence of the relaxation of a modified spin state, whereas the higher power dataset exhibited stretched exponential dependence of the evolution of the modified spin state, indicating the presence of high-power phenomena that emerge that retard the relaxation of the spin state.

TI Rotational Coherence Times of Polar Molecules in Optical Tweezers
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB Qubit coherence times are critical to the performance of any robust quantum computing platform. For quantum information processing using arrays of polar molecules, a key performance parameter is the molecular rotational coherence time. We report a 93(7) ms coherence time for rotational state qubits of laser cooled CaF molecules in optical tweezer traps, over an order of magnitude longer than previous systems. Inhomogeneous broadening due to the differential polarizability between the qubit states is suppressed by tuning the tweezer polarization and applied magnetic field to a "magic" angle. The coherence time is limited by the residual differential polarizability, implying improvement with further cooling. A single spin-echo pulse is able to extend the coherence time to nearly half a second. The measured coherence times demonstrate the potential of polar molecules as high fidelity qubits.

AB Feature selection is a common step in many ranking, classification, or prediction tasks and serves many purposes. By removing redundant or noisy features, the accuracy of ranking or classification can be improved and the computational cost of the subsequent learning steps can be reduced. However, feature selection can be itself a computationally expensive process. While for decades confined to theoretical algorithmic papers, quantum computing is now becoming a viable tool to tackle realistic problems, in particular special-purpose solvers based on the Quantum Annealing paradigm. This paper aims to explore the feasibility of using currently available quantum computing architectures to solve some quadratic feature selection algorithms for both ranking and classification. The experimental analysis includes 15 state-of-the-art datasets. The effectiveness obtained with quantum computing hardware is comparable to that of classical solvers, indicating that quantum computers are now reliable enough to tackle interesting problems. In terms of scalability, current generation quantum computers are able to provide a limited speedup over certain classical algorithms and hybrid quantum-classical strategies show lower computational cost for problems of more than a thousand features.

TI Experimental implementation of non-Clifford interleaved randomized
   benchmarking with a controlled-S gate
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Hardware-efficient transpilation of quantum circuits to a quantum device native gate set is essential for the execution of quantum algorithms on noisy quantum computers. Typical quantum devices utilize a gate set with a single two-qubit Clifford entangling gate per pair of coupled qubits; however, in some applications access to a non-Clifford two-qubit gate can result in more optimal circuit decompositions and also allows more flexibility in optimizing over noise. We demonstrate calibration of a low-error non-Clifford controlled-pi/2 phase (CS) gate on a cloud-based IBM Quantum system using the Qiskit Pulse framework. To measure the gate error of the calibrated CS gate we perform non-Clifford CNOT-dihedral interleaved randomized benchmarking. We are able to obtain a gate error of 5.9(7) x 10(-3) at a gate length 263 ns, which is close to the coherence limit of the associated qubits, and lower error than the back-end standard calibrated CNOT gate.

TI Stochastic noise can be helpful for variational quantum algorithms
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Saddle points constitute a crucial challenge for first-order gradient descent algorithms. In notions of classical machine learning, they are avoided, for example, by means of stochastic gradient descent methods. In this work, we provide evidence that the saddle-points problem can be naturally avoided in variational quantum algorithms by exploiting the presence of stochasticity. We prove convergence guarantees and present practical examples in numerical simulations and on quantum hardware. We argue that the natural stochasticity of variational algorithms can be beneficial for avoiding strict saddle points, i.e., those saddle points with at least one negative Hessian eigenvalue. This insight that some levels of shot noise could help is expected to add a new perspective to notions of near-term variational quantum algorithms.

TI A comparative study of quantum resources in bipartite
   Lipkin-Meshkov-Glick model under DM interaction and Zeeman splitting
SO OPEN PHYSICS
AB We assess the thermal resilience of key quantum resources-( & ell; 1 {\ell }_{1} )-norm coherence ( Q Q ), quantum discord ( D D ), logarithmic negativity ( & Laplacetrf;N {\mathcal{ {\mathcal L} N}} ), Bell nonlocality ( & Bernoullis; {\mathcal{ {\mathcal B} }} ), and quantum steering ( S {\mathcal{S}} )-in a bipartite Lipkin-Meshkov-Glick (LMG) spin system subject to competing Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya (DM) interactions and Zeeman splitting. By varying temperature ( T T ), spin-spin coupling ( lambda \lambda ), magnetic field strength ( B 0 {B}_{0} ), and DM amplitude ( D z {D}_{z} ), we reveal a clear hierarchy of thermal stability: coherence and discord remain robust well beyond the temperatures at which nonlocality ( & Bernoullis; {\mathcal{ {\mathcal B} }} ), steering ( S {\mathcal{S}} ), and bipartite entanglement ( & Laplacetrf;N {\mathcal{ {\mathcal L} N}} ) undergo successive thermal collapse. Stronger spin-spin coupling lambda \lambda and nonzero DM strength D z >= 0 {D}_{z}\ge 0 not only amplify overall quantum correlations but also elevate the critical temperatures T c {T}_{c} for the survival of each resource. In contrast, a large B 0 {B}_{0} polarizes the spins into paramagnetic states, thereby suppressing all quantum features at fixed T T . Notably, high amplitude of DM interactions preserves residual coherence and discord even in the high-temperature limit ( T >> T c ) \left(T\gg {T}_{c}) . These results establish practical operating thresholds for LMG-based quantum technologies in thermal environments and highlight D z {D}_{z} as a powerful tuning parameter for engineering thermally robust quantum resources.

TI Student review of innovations in quantum technologies. Part 6
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ELECTRONICS AND TELECOMMUNICATIONS
AB The aim of the paper is to show how graduated engineering students in classical ICT view practically the advent of the QIT. The students do their theses in El.Eng. and ICT and were asked how to implement now or in the future the QIT in their current or future work. Most of them have strictly defined research topics and in s ome cases t he r ealization stage is advanced. Thus, most of the potential QIT application areas are defined and quite narrow. In s uch a case, the issue t o be considered is the incorporation of QIT components and interfaces into the existing ICT infrastructure, software and hardware alike, and propose a solution as a reasonable functional hybrid system. The QIT components or circuits are not standalone in most cases, they should be somehow incorporated into existing environment, with a measurable added value. Not an easy task indeed. We have to excuse the students if the proposed solutions are not ripe enough. The exercise was proposed as an on-purpose publication workshop, related strictly to the fast and fascinating development of the QIT. The paper is a continuation of publishing exercises with previous groups of students participating in QIT lectures.

The experiment utilizes pulsed laser light and a carefully engineered optical system to emulate quantum entanglement, enabling students to investigate foundational quantum phenomena using accessible laboratory tools. Through practical measurements and simulations, students reconstruct quantum states and analyze correlations indicative of entanglement and non-locality. The setup includes polarization analysis across multiple measurement bases and culminates in the measurement of Bell's parameter using the CHSH test. By combining experimental emulation with computational analysis, this approach provides a compelling educational bridge between abstract quantum theory and hands-on experiments, highlighting the conceptual and practical relevance of quantum entanglement in modern physics.

AB High-pressure extreme conditions are crucial for realizing novel states and regulating material properties, while magnetic resonance technology is a widely used method to characterize microscopic magnetic structures and magnetic properties. The integration of these two fields offers new opportunities for cutting-edge research in condensed matter physics and materials science. However, conventional magnetic resonance is limited by several factors, such as low spin polarization and low signal detection efficiency, which makes in-situ measurement of micrometer-sized samples under ultra-high pressure a challenge. Recent advances in quantum sensing with color centers in solids, in particular, the development of quantum sensors based on nitrogen vacancy (NV) centers in diamond, provide an innovative solution for magnetic resonance and in-situ quantum sensing under high pressure. This article summarizes the effects of high-pressure conditions on the spin and optical properties, as well as on the magnetic resonance of diamond NV centers. In addition, this article reviews recent advances in high-pressure quantum sensing through applications such as magnetic imaging, pressure detection, and the study of the superconducting Meissner effect under high pressure.

SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INFORMATION THEORY
AB In this paper, we present new families of quantum channels for which corresponding minimum output Renyi p-entropy is not additive. Our manuscript is motivated by the results of Grudka et al. and we focus on channels characterized by both extensions and subspaces of the antisymmetric subspace in C-d circle times C-d , which exhibit additivity breaking for p > 2 .

TI A Review of Block Ciphers and Its Post-Quantum Considerations
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB Recent advances in cryptography aim to address threats posed by quantum computers. However, these advances have focused disproportionately on asymmetric schemes, while symmetric primitives like block ciphers have received less attention. The common assumption is that doubling block cipher key sizes provides adequate quantum resistance, but this oversimplifies the challenge. This paper provides a systematic examination of block cipher security in the quantum computing era. The paper first establishes a formal framework for understanding block cipher security, covering their mathematical foundations and essential security properties. Building on this foundation, we examine how quantum computing fundamentally challenges these security assumptions, going beyond the simple impact on key lengths. Our review of recent research reveals that quantum attacks can exploit structural vulnerabilities in block ciphers and their modes of operation, requiring more comprehensive defenses than key length adjustments alone. We analyze emerging approaches in quantum-resistant design and identify critical areas requiring further research to ensure block cipher security in a post-quantum world.

TI Enhanced quantum sensing in time-modulated non-Hermitian systems
SO CHINESE JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB Enhancing the sensitivity of quantum sensing near exceptional points represents a significant phenomenon in non-Hermitian (NH) systems. However, the application of this property in time-modulated NH systems remains largely unexplored. In this work, we propose two theoretical schemes to achieve enhanced quantum sensing in time-modulated NH systems by leveraging the coalescence of eigenvalues and eigenstates. We conduct a comprehensive analysis of the full energy spectrum, including both real and imaginary components, the population distribution of eigenstates, and various characteristics associated with optimal conditions for sensitivity enhancement. Numerical simulations confirm that eigenvalue-based quantum sensors exhibit a 9.21-fold improvement over conventional Hermitian sensors, aligning with the performance of existing time-independent NH sensors. In contrast, for eigenstate-based quantum sensors, the enhancement reaches up to 50 times that of conventional Hermitian sensors, surpassing the performance of existing time-independent NH sensors. Moreover, the eigenstate-based sensor exhibits divergent susceptibility even when the system's parameters are not close to an exceptional point. Our findings pave the way for advanced sensing in time-sensitive contexts, complementing existing efforts to harness the unique properties of open systems.

TI Long-Range Nonstabilizerness and Phases of Matter
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB Long-range nonstabilizerness can be defined as the amount of nonstabilizerness that cannot be removed by shallow local quantum circuits. We study long-range nonstabilizerness in the context of many-body quantum physics, a task with possible implications for quantum-state preparation protocols and implementation of quantum-error correcting codes. After presenting a simple argument showing that long-range nonstabilizerness is a generic property of many-body states, we restrict to the class of ground states of gapped local Hamiltonians. We focus on one-dimensional (1D) systems and present rigorous results in the context of translation-invariant matrix product states (MPSs), with our analysis extending to all gapped 1D phases under widely accepted physical assumptions. By analyzing the fixed points of the MPS renormalization-group flow, we provide a sufficient condition for long-range nonstabilizerness, which depends entirely on the local MPS tensors. Physically, our condition captures the fact that the mutual information between distant regions of stabilizer fixed points is quantized and remains so after applying shallow quantum circuits.

AB An Entanglement Generation Switch (EGS) is a quantum network hub that provides entangled states to a set of connected nodes by enabling them to share a limited number of hub resources. As entanglement requests arrive, they join dedicated queues corresponding to the nodes from which they originate. We propose a load-balancing policy wherein the EGS queries nodes for entanglement requests by randomly sampling d of all available request queues and choosing the longest of these to service. This policy is an instance of the well-known power-of-d-choices paradigm previously introduced for classical systems such as data-centers. In contrast to previous models, however, we place queues at nodes instead of directly at the EGS, which offers some practical advantages. Additionally, we incorporate a tunable back-off mechanism into our load-balancing scheme to reduce the classical communication load in the network. To study the policy, we consider a homogeneous star network topology that has the EGS at its center, and model it as a queueing system with requests that arrive according to a Poisson process and whose service times are exponentially distributed. We provide an asymptotic analysis of the system by deriving a set of differential equations that describe the dynamics of the mean-field limit and provide expressions for the corresponding unique equilibrium state. Consistent with analogous results from randomized load-balancing for classical systems, we observe a significant decrease in the average request processing time when the number of choices d increases from one to two during the sampling process, with diminishing returns for a higher number of choices. We also observe that our mean-field model provides a good approximation to study even moderately-sized systems.

TI Optical quantum sensing for agnostic environments via deep learning
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Optical quantum sensing promises measurement precision beyond classical sensors termed the Heisenberg limit (HL). However, conventional methodologies often rely on prior knowledge of the target system to achieve HL, presenting challenges in practical applications. Addressing this limitation, we introduce an innovative deep-learning-based quantum sensing scheme (DQS), enabling optical quantum sensors to attain HL in agnostic environments. DQS incorporates two essential components: a graph neural network (GNN) predictor and a trigonometric interpolation algorithm. Operating within a data-driven paradigm, DQS utilizes the GNN predictor, trained on offline data, to unveil the intrinsic relationships between the optical setups employed in preparing the probe state and the resulting quantum Fisher information (QFI) after interaction with the agnostic environment. This distilled knowledge facilitates the identification of optimal optical setups associated with maximal QFI. Subsequently, DQS employs a trigonometric interpolation algorithm to recover the unknown parameter estimates for the identified optical setups. Extensive experiments are conducted to investigate the performance of DQS under different settings up to eight photons. Our findings not only offer a different lens through which to accelerate optical quantum sensing tasks but also catalyze future research integrating deep learning and quantum mechanics.

TI Quantum Bitcoin Mining
SO ENTROPY
AB This paper studies the effect of quantum computers on Bitcoin mining. The shift in computational paradigm towards quantum computation allows the entire search space of the golden nonce to be queried at once by exploiting quantum superpositions and entanglement. Using Grover's algorithm, a solution can be extracted in time O(root 2(256)/t), where t is the target value for the nonce. This is better using a square root over the classical search algorithm that requires O(2(256)/t) tries. If sufficiently large quantum computers are available for the public, mining activity in the classical sense becomes obsolete, as quantum computers always win. Without considering quantum noise, the size of the quantum computer needs to be approximate to 10(4) qubits.

TI Observing quantum many-body scars in random quantum circuits
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB The Schwinger model describes quantum electrodynamics in 1+1 dimensions, it is a prototype for quantum chromodynamics, and its lattice version allows for a quantum link model description that can be simulated using modern quantum devices. In this work, we devise quantum simulations to investigate the dynamics of this model in its low-dimensional form, where the gauge field degrees of freedom are described by spin-21 operators. We apply Trotterization to write quantum circuits that effectively generate the evolution under the Schwinger model Hamiltonian. We consider both sequential circuits, with a fixed-gate sequence, and randomized ones. Utilizing the correspondence between the Schwinger model and the PXP model, known for its quantum scars, we investigate the presence of quantum scar states in the Schwinger model by identifying states exhibiting extended thermalization times in our circuit evolutions. Our comparison of sequential and randomized circuit dynamics shows that the nonthermal sector of the Hilbert space, including the scars, is more sensitive to randomization.

TI Resolving Fock states near the Kerr-free point of a superconducting

SO NPJ QUANTUM INFORMATION
AB We have designed a tunable nonlinear resonator terminated by a SNAIL (Superconducting Nonlinear Asymmetric Inductive eLement). Such a device possesses a Kerr-free point in which the external magnetic flux allows to suppress the Kerr interaction. We have excited photons near this Kerr-free point and characterized the device using a transmon qubit. The excitation spectrum of the qubit allows to observe photon-number-dependent frequency shifts about nine times larger than the qubit linewidth. Our study demonstrates a compact integrated platform for continuous-variable quantum processing that combines large couplings, considerable relaxation times and excellent control over the photon mode structure in the microwave domain.

TI Floquet Engineering and Harnessing Giant Atoms in Frequency-Comb
   Emission and Bichromatic Correlations in Waveguide QED
SO LASER & PHOTONICS REVIEWS
AB The capability to design spectrally controlled photon emission is not only fundamentally interesting for understanding frequency-encoded light-matter interactions, but also is essential for realizing the preparation and manipulation of quantum states. Here, a dynamically modulated qubit array is considered, and realize frequency-controlled single-photon emission focusing on the generation of a frequency comb constituted solely of even-parity or anti-Stokes sidebands. This system also offers parity-dependent bunching and antibunching in frequency-filtered quantum correlations. In particular, the waveguide quantum electrodynamics (QED) setup is extended to include chiral and non-local coupling architectures, thereby enhancing its versatility in Floquet engineering. This proposal also supports the predictable generation of high-dimensional entangled quantum states, where the corresponding effective Hilbert space dimension is well controlled by energy modulation. Moreover, the utilisation of sophisticated numerical tools, such as the matrix product states (MPSs) and the discretization approach, enables the efficient simulation of multi-photon dynamics, in which the non-Markovian Floquet steady states emerge. This work fundamentally broadens the fields of collective emission, and has wide applications in implementing frequency-encoded quantum information processing and many-body quantum simulation.

TI Quantum circuit for implementing Serpent algorithm with low costs
SO SCIENTIA SINICA-PHYSICA MECHANICA & ASTRONOMICA
AB Serpent, one of the AES candidate algorithms, is known for its high security and attack resistance. It is suitable for areas with high information security requirements. Serpent's distinctive nonlinear structure is the S-boxes. This paper studies how to build the quantum circuit for Serpent algorithm with lower costs. By combining with the quantum circuits of Sboxes with fewer qubits and quantum gates and the inverse quantum circuits of S-boxes, the key expansion quantum circuit can be constructed. Moreover, by decomposing the 3-controlled CNOT gates appearing in the quantum circuits of the S-boxes and optimizing the decomposed quantum circuits, the number of Toffoli gates is further reduced. In conjunction with the proposed quantum circuits, two types of quantum circuits requiring 448 qubits and 92288 T gates and 384 qubits and 118944 T gates are given to realize the Serpent algorithm. In comparison with the previous study, which required 800 qubits and 132608 T gates, the quantum circuit in this paper requires fewer resources. Furthermore, the S-boxes and key expansion quantum circuits used in the study can reduce the quantum resources in implementing Serpent, reducing the quantum circuit scale required to attack Serpent by the Grover algorithm.

TI Demonstrating a universal logical gate set in error-detecting surface
   codes on a superconducting quantum processor
SO NPJ QUANTUM INFORMATION
AB Fault-tolerant quantum computing (FTQC) is essential for achieving large-scale practical quantum computation. Implementing arbitrary FTQC requires the execution of a universal gate set on logical qubits, which is highly challenging. Particularly, in the superconducting system, two-qubit gates on surface code logical qubits have not been realized. Here, we experimentally implement a logical CNOT gate along with arbitrary single-qubit rotation gates on distance-2 surface codes using the superconducting quantum processor Wukong, thereby demonstrating a universal logical gate set. In the experiment, we demonstrate the transversal CNOT gate on a two-dimensional topological processor based on a tailored encoding circuit, at the cost of removing the ancilla qubits required for stabilizer measurements. Furthermore, we fault-tolerantly prepare logical Bell states and observe a violation of CHSH inequality, confirming the entanglement between logical qubits. Using the logical CNOT gate and an ancilla logical state, arbitrary single-qubit rotation gates are realized through gate teleportation. All logical gates are characterized on a complete state set and their fidelities are evaluated by logical Pauli transfer matrices. The demonstration of a universal logical gate set and the entangled logical states highlights significant aspects of FTQC on superconducting quantum processors.

TI Variational algorithms for linear algebra
SO SCIENCE BULLETIN
AB Quantum algorithms have been developed for efficiently solving linear algebra tasks. However, they generally require deep circuits and hence universal fault-tolerant quantum computers. In this work, we propose variational algorithms for linear algebra tasks that are compatible with noisy intermediate-scale quantum devices. We show that the solutions of linear systems of equations and matrix-vector multiplications can be translated as the ground states of the constructed Hamiltonians. Based on the variational quantum algorithms, we introduce Hamiltonian morphing together with an adaptive ansatz for efficiently finding the ground state, and show the solution verification. Our algorithms are especially suitable for linear algebra problems with sparse matrices, and have wide applications in machine learning and optimisation problems. The algorithm for matrix multiplications can be also used for Hamiltonian simulation and open system simulation. We evaluate the cost and effectiveness of our algorithm through numerical simulations for solving linear systems of equations. We implement the algorithm on the IBM quantum cloud device with a high solution fidelity of 99.95%. (c) 2021 Science China Press. Published by Elsevier B.V. and Science China Press.

TI Robust finite-temperature many-body scarring on a quantum computer
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Mechanisms for suppressing thermalization in disorder-free many-body systems, such as Hilbert space fragmentation and quantum many-body scars, have recently attracted much interest in foundations of quantum statistical physics and potential quantum information processing applications. However, their sensitivity to realistic effects such as finite temperature remains largely unexplored. Here, we have utilized IBM's Kolkata quantum processor to demonstrate an unexpected robustness of quantum many-body scars at finite temperatures when the system is prepared in a thermal Gibbs ensemble. We identify such robustness in the PXP model, which describes quantum many-body scars in experimental systems of Rydberg atom arrays and ultracold atoms in tilted Bose-Hubbard optical lattices. By contrast, other theoretical models which host exact quantum many-body scars are found to lack such robustness and their scarring properties quickly decay with temperature. Our study sheds light on the important differences between scarred models in terms of their algebraic structures, which impacts their resilience to finite temperature.

TI The role of encodings and distance metrics for the quantum nearest
   neighbor
SO QUANTUM MACHINE INTELLIGENCE
AB Over the past few years, we observed a rethinking of classical artificial intelligence algorithms from a quantum computing perspective. This trend is driven by the peculiar properties of quantum mechanics, which offer the potential to enhance artificial intelligence capabilities, enabling it to surpass the constraints of classical computing. However, redesigning classical algorithms into their quantum equivalents is not straightforward and poses numerous challenges. In this study, we analyze in-depth two orthogonal designs of the quantum K-nearest neighbor classifier. In particular, we show two solutions based on amplitude encoding and basis encoding of data, respectively. These two types of encoding impact the overall structure of the respective algorithms, which employ different distance metrics and show different performances. By breaking down each quantum algorithm, we clarify and compare implementation aspects ranging from data preparation to classification. Eventually, we discuss the difficulties associated with data preparation, the theoretical advantage of quantum algorithms, and their impact on performance with respect to the classical counterpart.

TI Hybrid QuantumClassical Generative Adversarial Network for
   High-Resolution Image Generation
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON QUANTUM ENGINEERING
AB Quantum machine learning (QML) has received increasing attention due to its potential to outperform classical machine learning methods in problems, such as classification and identification tasks. A subclass of QML methods is quantum generative adversarial networks (QGANs), which have been studied as a quantum counterpart of classical GANs widely used in image manipulation and generation tasks. The existing work on QGANs is still limited to small-scale proof-of-concept examples based on images with significant downscaling. Here, we integrate classical and quantum techniques to propose a new hybrid quantum-classical GAN framework. We demonstrate its superior learning capabilities over existing quantum techniques by generating $28 \times 28$ pixels grayscale images without dimensionality reduction or classical pre/postprocessing on multiple classes of the standard Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology (MNIST) and Fashion MNIST datasets, which achieves comparable results to classical frameworks with three orders of magnitude less trainable generator parameters. To gain further insight into the working of our hybrid approach, we systematically explore the impact of its parameter space by varying the number of qubits, the size of image patches, the number of layers in the generator, the shape of the patches, and the choice of prior distribution. Our results show that increasing the quantum generator size generally improves the learning capability of the network. The developed framework provides a foundation for future design of QGANs with optimal parameter set tailored for complex image generation tasks.

TI Efficient Implementation of PRESENT and GIFT on Quantum Computers
SO APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL
AB Grover search algorithm is the most representative quantum attack method that threatens the security of symmetric key cryptography. If the Grover search algorithm is applied to symmetric key cryptography, the security level of target symmetric key cryptography can be lowered from n-bit to n/2-bit. When applying Grover's search algorithm to the block cipher that is the target of potential quantum attacks, the target block cipher must be implemented as quantum circuits. Starting with the AES block cipher, a number of works have been conducted to optimize and implement target block ciphers into quantum circuits. Recently, many studies have been published to implement lightweight block ciphers as quantum circuits. In this paper, we present optimal quantum circuit designs of symmetric key cryptography, including PRESENT and GIFT block ciphers. The proposed method optimized PRESENT and GIFT block ciphers by minimizing qubits, quantum gates, and circuit depth. We compare proposed PRESENT and GIFT quantum circuits with other results of lightweight block cipher implementations in quantum circuits. Finally, quantum resources of PRESENT and GIFT block ciphers required for the oracle of the Grover search algorithm were estimated.

TI Time-dependent quantum correlations in two-dimensional expanding
   spacetime
SO EUROPEAN PHYSICAL JOURNAL C
AB In expanding universes, the entanglement entropy must be time-dependent because the background geometry changes with time. For understanding time evolution of quantum correlations, we take into account two distinct holographic models, the dS boundary model and the braneworld model. In this work, we focus on two-dimensional expanding universes for analytic calculation and comparison. Although two holographic models realize expanding universes in totally different ways, we show that they result in the qualitatively same time-dependence for eternal inflation. We further investigate the time-dependent correlations in the radiation-dominated era of the braneworld model. Intriguingly, the holographic result reveals that a thermal system in the expanding universe is dethermalized after a critical time characterized by the subsystem size.

TI Power system fault diagnosis with quantum computing and efficient gate
   decomposition
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB Power system fault diagnosis is crucial for identifying the location and causes of faults and providing decision-making support for power dispatchers. However, most classical methods suffer from significant time-consuming, memory overhead, and computational complexity issues as the scale of the power system concerned increases. With rapid development of quantum computing technology, the combinatorial optimization method based on quantum computing has shown certain advantages in computational time over existing methods. Given this background, this paper proposes a quantum computing based power system fault diagnosis method with the quantum approximate optimization algorithm. The proposed method reformulates the fault diagnosis problem as a Hamiltonian by using Ising model, which completely preserves the coupling relationship between faulty components and various operations of protective relays and circuit breakers. Additionally, to enhance problem-solving efficiency under current equipment limitations, the symmetric equivalent decomposition method of multi-z-rotation gate is utilized. Furthermore, the small probability characteristics of power system events is utilized to reduce the number of qubits. Simulation results based on the test system show that the proposed methods can achieve the same optimal results with a faster speed compared with the classical higher-order solver provided by D-Wave.

AB This article proposes a quantum spatial graph convolutional neural network (QSGCN) model that is implementable on quantum circuits, providing a novel avenue to processing non-Euclidean type data based on the state-of-the-art parameterized quantum circuit (PQC) computing platforms. Four basic blocks are constructed to formulate the whole QSGCN model, including the quantum encoding, the quantum graph convolutional layer, the quantum graph pooling layer, and the network optimization. In particular, the trainability of the QSGCN model is analyzed through discussions on the barren plateau phenomenon. Simulation results from various types of graph data are presented to demonstrate the learning, generalization, and robustness capabilities of the proposed quantum neural network (QNN) model.

TI Exponentially tighter bounds on limitations of quantum error mitigation
SO NATURE PHYSICS
AB Quantum error mitigation has been proposed as a means to combat unwanted and unavoidable errors in near-term quantum computing without the heavy resource overheads required by fault-tolerant schemes. Recently, error mitigation has been successfully applied to reduce noise in near-term applications. In this work, however, we identify strong limitations to the degree to which quantum noise can be effectively 'undone' for larger system sizes. Our framework rigorously captures large classes of error-mitigation schemes in use today. By relating error mitigation to a statistical inference problem, we show that even at shallow circuit depths comparable to those of current experiments, a superpolynomial number of samples is needed in the worst case to estimate the expectation values of noiseless observables, the principal task of error mitigation. Notably, our construction implies that scrambling due to noise can kick in at exponentially smaller depths than previously thought. Noise also impacts other near-term applications by constraining kernel estimation in quantum machine learning, causing an earlier emergence of noise-induced barren plateaus in variational quantum algorithms and ruling out exponential quantum speed-ups in estimating expectation values in the presence of noise or preparing the ground state of a Hamiltonian.
   Error mitigation has helped improve the performance of current quantum computing devices. Now, a mathematical analysis of the technique suggests its benefits may not extend to larger systems.

TI Scattering in the Ising model with the quantum Lanczos algorithm *
SO NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB Time evolution and scattering simulation in phenomenological models are of great interest for testing and validating the potential for near-term quantum computers to simulate quantum field theories. Here, we simulate one-particle propagation and two-particle scattering in the one-dimensional transverse Ising model for 3 and 4 spatial sites with periodic boundary conditions on a quantum computer. We use the quantum Lanczos algorithm to obtain all energy levels and corresponding eigenstates of the system. We simplify the quantum computation by taking advantage of the symmetries of the system. These results enable us to compute one- and two-particle transition amplitudes, particle numbers for spatial sites, and the transverse magnetization as functions of time. The quantum circuits were executed on various IBM Q superconducting hardware. The experimental results are in very good agreement with the values obtained using exact diagonalization.

TI Ultrafast coherent control of a hole spin qubit in a germanium quantum
   dot
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Hole-spin qubits in germanium are promising candidates for rapid, all-electrical qubit control. Here the authors report Rabi oscillations with the record frequency of 540 MHz in a hole-based double quantum dot in a germanium hut wire, which is attributed to strong spin-orbit interaction of heavy holes.
   Operation speed and coherence time are two core measures for the viability of a qubit. Strong spin-orbit interaction (SOI) and relatively weak hyperfine interaction make holes in germanium (Ge) intriguing candidates for spin qubits with rapid, all-electrical coherent control. Here we report ultrafast single-spin manipulation in a hole-based double quantum dot in a germanium hut wire (GHW). Mediated by the strong SOI, a Rabi frequency exceeding 540 MHz is observed at a magnetic field of 100 mT, setting a record for ultrafast spin qubit control in semiconductor systems. We demonstrate that the strong SOI of heavy holes (HHs) in our GHW, characterized by a very short spin-orbit length of 1.5 nm, enables the rapid gate operations we accomplish. Our results demonstrate the potential of ultrafast coherent control of hole spin qubits to meet the requirement of DiVincenzo's criteria for a scalable quantum information processor.

TI Experimental Single-Copy Entanglement Distillation
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB The phenomenon of entanglement marks one of the furthest departures from classical physics and is indispensable for quantum information processing. Despite its fundamental importance, the distribution of entanglement over long distances through photons is unfortunately hindered by unavoidable decoherence effects. Entanglement distillation is a means of restoring the quality of such diluted entanglement by concentrating it into a pair of qubits. Conventionally, this would be done by distributing multiple photon pairs and distilling the entanglement into a single pair. Here, we turn around this paradigm by utilizing pairs of single photons entangled in multiple degrees of freedom. Specifically, we make use of the polarization and the energy-time domain of photons, both of which are extensively field tested. We experimentally chart the domain of distillable states and achieve relative fidelity gains up to 13.8%. Compared to the two-copy scheme, the distillation rate of our single-copy scheme is several orders of magnitude higher, paving the way towards high-capacity and noise-resilient quantum networks.

TI Letting the Tiger out of Its Cage: Bosonic Coding without Concatenation
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW X
AB Continuous-variable cat codes are encodings into a single photonic or phononic mode that offer a promising avenue for hardware-efficient fault-tolerant quantum computation. Protecting information in a cat code requires measuring the mode's occupation number modulo two, but this can be relaxed to a linear occupation-number constraint using the alternative two-mode pair-cat encoding. We construct multimode codes with similar linear constraints using any two integer matrices satisfying a Calderbank-Shor-Steanelike homological condition of a quantum rotor code. Just like the pair-cat code, syndrome extraction can be performed in tandem with stabilizing dissipation using current superconducting-circuit designs. The framework includes codes with various finite-or infinite-dimensional code spaces and codes with finite or infinite Fock-state support. It encompasses two-component cat, pair-cat, dual-rail, two-mode binomial, various bosonic repetition codes, and aspects of chi-squared encodings, while also yielding codes from homological products, lattices, generalized coherent states, and algebraic varieties. Among our examples are analogs of repetition codes, the Shor code, and a surface-code-like construction that is not a concatenation of a known cat code with the qubit surface code. Code words are coherent states projected into a Fock-state subspace defined by an integer matrix, and their overlaps are governed by Gelfand-Kapranov-Zelevinsky hypergeometric functions.

TI Macroscopic quantum entanglement between an optomechanical cavity and a
   continuous field in presence of non-Markovian noise
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Probing quantum entanglement with macroscopic objects allows us to test quantum mechanics in new regimes. One way to realize such behavior is to couple a macroscopic mechanical oscillator to a continuous light field via radiation pressure. In view of this, the system that is discussed comprises an optomechanical cavity driven by a coherent optical field in the unresolved sideband regime where we assume Gaussian states and dynamics. We develop a framework to quantify the amount of entanglement in the system numerically. Different from previous work, we treat non-Markovian noise and take into account both the continuous optical field and the cavity mode. We apply our framework to the case of the Advanced Laser Interferometer Gravitational -Wave Observatory and discuss the parameter regimes where entanglement exists, even in the presence of quantum and classical noises.

TI A Multifaceted Deepfake Prevention Framework Integrating Blockchain,
   Post-Quantum Cryptography, Hybrid Watermarking, Human Oversight, and
   Policy Governance
SO COMPUTERS
AB Deepfake technology, driven by advances in artificial intelligence (AI) and deep learning (DL), has become one of the foremost threats to digital trust and the authenticity of information. Despite the rapid development of deepfake detection methods, the dynamic evolution of generative models continues to outpace current mitigation efforts. This highlights the pressing need for more effective and proactive deepfake prevention strategy. This study introduces a comprehensive and multifaceted deepfake prevention framework that leverages both technical and non-technical countermeasures and involves collaboration among key stakeholders in a unified structure. The proposed framework has four modules: trusted content assurance, detection and monitoring, awareness and human-in-the-loop verification, and policy, governance, and regulation. The framework uses a combination of hybrid watermarking and embedding techniques, as well as cryptographic digital signature algorithms (DSAs) and blockchain technologies, to make sure that the media is authentic, traceable, and cannot be denied. Comparative experiments were conducted in this research using both classical and post-quantum DSAs to evaluate their efficiency, resource consumption, and gas costs in blockchain operations. The results revealed that the Falcon-512 algorithm outperformed other post-quantum algorithms while consuming fewer resources and lowering gas costs, making it a preferable option for real-time, quantum-resilient deepfake prevention. The framework also employed AI-based detection models and human oversight to enhance detection accuracy and robustness. Overall, this research offers a novel, multifaceted, and governance-aware strategy for deepfake prevention. The proposed approach significantly contributes to mitigating deepfake threats and offers a practical foundation for secure and transparent digital media ecosystems.

TI Entanglement Distillation Based on Polarization and Frequency
   Hyperentanglement
SO IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN QUANTUM ELECTRONICS
AB Entanglement distillation has many applications in quantum information processing and is an important tool for improving the quality and efficiency of quantum communication, cryptography, computing, and simulation. We propose an entanglement distillation scheme using only one pair of polarization-frequency hyperentangled photons, which can be equivalently viewed as containing two pairs of entangled logical qubits: a pair of polarization-entangled qubits and a pair of frequency-entangled qubits. To perform the required controlled NOT (CNOT) operation between the two qubits we consider the use of a polarization-dependent frequency converter. Compared to past methods of entanglement distillation that relied on polarization and spatial-mode/energy-time degree of freedom, the utilization of frequency-encoded qubits offers an advantage in that it is immune to bit-flip errors when the channel is linear. After distillation, the fidelity of polarization entanglement can be significantly improved by sacrificing the frequency degree of freedom. Through simulation, we show that high fidelity gains, large yield, and high distillation rate can be achieved. Our distillation scheme is simple to implement with current technologies, compatible with existing telecommunication fiber networks, and is a promising approach for achieving efficient quantum communication.

AB Present-day quantum computers suffer from various noises or errors such as, gate error, relaxation, dephasing, readout error, and crosstalk. Besides, they offer a limited number of qubits with restrictive connectivity. Therefore, quantum programs running these computers face resilience issues and low output fidelities. The noise in the cloud-based access of quantum computers also introduce new modes of security and privacy issues. Furthermore, quantum computers face several threat models from insider and outsider adversaries including input tampering, program misallocation, fault injection, Reverse Engineering (RE) and Cloning. This paper provides an overview of various assets embedded in quantum computers and programs, vulnerabilities and attack models and the relation between resilience and security. We also cover countermeasures against the reliability and security issues and present future outlook for security of quantum computing.

AB Quantum computing promises to revolutionize various fields, yet the execution of quantum programs necessitates an effective compilation process. This involves strategically mapping quantum circuits onto the physical qubits of a quantum processor. The qubits' arrangement, or topology, is pivotal to the circuit's performance, a factor that often defies traditional heuristic or manual optimization methods due to its complexity. In this study, we introduce a novel approach leveraging reinforcement learning to dynamically tailor qubit topologies to the unique specifications of individual quantum circuits, guiding algorithm-driven quantum processor topology design for reducing the depth of mapped circuit, which is particularly critical for the output accuracy on noisy quantum processors. Our method marks a significant departure from previous methods that have been constrained to mapping circuits onto a fixed processor topology. Experiments demonstrate that we have achieved notable enhancements in circuit performance, with a minimum of 20% reduction in circuit depth in 60% of the cases examined, and a maximum enhancement of up to 46%. Furthermore, the pronounced benefits of our approach in reducing circuit depth become increasingly evident as the scale of the quantum circuits increases, exhibiting the scalability of our method in terms of problem size. This work advances the co-design of quantum processor architecture and algorithm mapping, offering a promising avenue for future research and development in the field.

TI Solving flexible job shop scheduling problems in manufacturing with
   Quantum Annealing
SO PRODUCTION ENGINEERING-RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT
AB Quantum Annealing (QA) is a metaheuristic for solving optimization problems in a time-efficient manner. Therefore, quantum mechanical effects are used to compute and evaluate many possible solutions of an optimization problem simultaneously. Recent studies have shown the potential of QA for solving such complex assignment problems within milliseconds. This also applies for the field of job shop scheduling, where the existing approaches however focus on small problem sizes. To assess the full potential of QA in this area for industry-scale problem formulations, it is necessary to consider larger problem instances and to evaluate the potentials of computing these job shop scheduling problems while finding a near-optimal solution in a time-efficient manner. Consequently, this paper presents a QA-based job shop scheduling. In particular, flexible job shop scheduling problems in various sizes are computed with QA, demonstrating the efficiency of the approach regarding scalability, solutions quality, and computing time. For the evaluation of the proposed approach, the solutions are compared in a scientific benchmark with state-of-the-art algorithms for solving flexible job shop scheduling problems. The results indicate that QA has the potential for solving flexible job shop scheduling problems in a time efficient manner. Even large problem instances can be computed within seconds, which offers the possibility for application in industry.

TI Time-bin encoding quantum key distribution in free-space horizontal
   links during nighttime and daytime
SO OPTICA QUANTUM
AB Free-space quantum key distribution (QKD) represents a groundbreaking advancement in secure communication, enabling secure key exchange over vast distances and offering robust encryption for the future quantum internet. However, the compatibility between fiber and free-space infrastructures continues to pose challenges for QKD protocols. Indeed, free-space and fiber-based networks commonly use different wavelengths and qubits encoding schemes. On the one hand, free-space QKD typically exploits visible light for its beneficial beam divergence compared with longer wavelengths, and polarization encoding for its robustness against turbulence. On the other hand, fiber-based QKD employs infrared light, particularly the C-band, because it shows the minimum losses with silica fibers, and time-bin encoding, due to polarization instability in optical fibers. In our study, we demonstrate the viability of a time-bin encoded QKD protocol operating in the C-band through horizontal turbulent free-space channels. We test the setup into a 50-m- and a 500-m-long link, respectively achieving an average secure key rate of 793 kbps and 40 kbps over several hours of measurements. The results encourage further exploration of the interoperability between free-space and fiber-based infrastructures, opening new possibilities for connecting terminal users with satellites in hybrid infrastructures.

TI Fault-tolerant preparation of quantum polar codes encoding one logical
   qubit
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB This paper explores an approach to fault-tolerant quantum computing (FTQC), relying on quantum polar codes. We consider quantum polar codes of Calderbank-Shor-Steane type, encoding one logical qubit, which we refer to as Q(1) codes. First, we show that a subfamily of Q(1) codes is equivalent to the well-known family of Shor codes. Moreover, we show that Q 1 codes significantly outperform Shor codes, of the same length and minimum distance. Second, we consider the fault-tolerant preparation of Q(1) code states. We give a recursive procedure to prepare a Q(1) code state, based on two-qubit Pauli measurements only. The procedure is not by itself fault-tolerant; however, the measurement operations therein provide redundant classical bits, which can be advantageously used for error detection. Fault tolerance is then achieved by combining the proposed recursive procedure with an error detection method. Finally, we consider the fault-tolerant error correction ofQ 1 codes. We use Steane error correction, which incorporates the proposed fault-tolerant code state preparation procedure. We provide numerical estimates of the logical error rates for Q(1) and Shor codes of length 16 and 64 qubits, assuming a circuit-level depolarizing noise model. Remarkably, the Q(1) code of length 64 qubits achieves a logical error rate very close to 10(-6) for the physical error rate p = 10(-3), therefore demonstrating the potential of the proposed polar-codes-based approach to FTQC.

TI Universal control of four singlet-triplet qubits
SO NATURE NANOTECHNOLOGY
AB The coherent control of interacting spins in semiconductor quantum dots is of strong interest for quantum information processing and for studying quantum magnetism from the bottom up. Here we present a 2 x 4 germanium quantum dot array with full and controllable interactions between nearest-neighbour spins. As a demonstration of the level of control, we define four singlet-triplet qubits in this system and show two-axis single-qubit control of each qubit and SWAP-style two-qubit gates between all neighbouring qubit pairs, yielding average single-qubit gate fidelities of 99.49(8)-99.84(1)% and Bell state fidelities of 73(1)-90(1)%. Combining these operations, we experimentally implement a circuit designed to generate and distribute entanglement across the array. A remote Bell state with a fidelity of 75(2)% and concurrence of 22(4)% is achieved. These results highlight the potential of singlet-triplet qubits as a competing platform for quantum computing and indicate that scaling up the control of quantum dot spins in extended bilinear arrays can be feasible.
   Singlet-triplet qubits implemented in a 2 x 4 germanium quantum dot array allow for a quantum circuit that generates and distributes entanglement across the array with a remote Bell state fidelity of 75(2)% between the first and last qubit.

TI Quantum algorithms for group convolution, cross-correlation, and
   equivariant transformations
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Group convolutions and cross-correlations, which are equivariant to the actions of group elements, are commonly used to analyze or take advantage of symmetries inherent in a given problem setting. Here, we provide efficient quantum algorithms for performing linear group convolutions and cross-correlations on data stored as quantum states. Runtimes for our algorithms are poly-logarithmic in the dimension of the group and the desired error of the operation. Motivated by the rich literature on quantum algorithms for solving algebraic problems, our theoretical framework opens a path for quantizing many algorithms in machine learning and numerical methods that employ group operations.

TI Drastic Slowdown of EIT Dynamics by Doppler Broadening and Its
   Compensation in Room-Temperature Atomic Vapor
SO PHOTONICS
AB The transient dynamics of electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT) are fundamental to understanding coherent light-atom interactions and the advancement of quantum technologies such as optical switching and quantum memory. However, in room-temperature atomic vapors, Doppler broadening significantly alters these dynamics, yet a comprehensive understanding of its impact on the transient EIT response remains lacking. In this study, we combine analytical and numerical methods to investigate the absorption dynamics of a weak probe field in a three-level Lambda-type system driven by a strong coupling field, based on the optical Bloch equations and Laplace transform techniques. Our results show that the transient response is highly sensitive to both the atomic spontaneous emission rate and the Rabi frequency of the coupling field. Increasing the coupling field intensity not only accelerates the approach to steady state but also induces oscillatory dynamics and negative absorption. Under Doppler broadening, the time required to reach steady state increases by approximately three orders of magnitude compared to the Doppler-free case-an effect that is surprisingly insensitive to temperature variations across the 100-400 K range. Moreover, restoring a short steady-state time under broadened conditions necessitates increasing the coupling laser intensity by two orders of magnitude. These findings provide key insights into the influence of Doppler broadening on coherent transient processes and offer practical guidelines for the design of room-temperature atomic devices, including quantum memories and optical modulators.

AB Quantum key distribution (QKD) is a symmetric key exchange mechanism designed to enhance the security of current communication systems. Although QKD provides unconditional security, it also comes with deployment challenges. One challenge is the distance limitation between the transmitter and receiver, which restricts the large-scale adoption of QKD. To overcome this, trusted relays are used as intermediate nodes, allowing QKD to evolve from distance-limited point-to-point connections to unlimited QKD networks (QKDN). With an increasing deployment of QKD and a growing number of applications requesting keys, quality of service (QoS) constraints must be set for efficient key resource management to alleviate the risk of rejecting application requests. In this work, we integrate key delivery delay and maximum requested key size as QoS constraints in a novel key allocation algorithm built on three QKDN layers - quantum, key management and service. Moreover, we design key relaying using quantum key pools and virtual quantum key pools as storage mechanisms. We use static and dynamic weights for relay path computation and evaluate their impact on the proposed key allocation strategies with QoS constraints and find that static weights show a good overall performance for QKDN, while performance with dynamic weights varies based on historical key consumption data.

TI A device-independent quantum key distribution system for distant users
SO NATURE
AB Device-independent quantum key distribution (DIQKD) enables the generation of secret keys over an untrusted channel using uncharacterized and potentially untrusted devices(1-9). The proper and secure functioning of the devices can be certified by a statistical test using a Bell inequality(10-12). This test originates from the foundations of quantum physics and also ensures robustness against implementation loopholes(13), thereby leaving only the integrity of the users' locations to be guaranteed by other means. The realization of DIQKD, however, is extremely challenging-mainly because it is difficult to establish high-quality entangled states between two remote locations with high detection efficiency. Here we present an experimental system that enables for DIQKD between two distant users. The experiment is based on the generation and analysis of event-ready entanglement between two independently trapped single rubidium atoms located in buildings 400 metre apart(14). By achieving an entanglement fidelity of F >= 0.892(23) and implementing a DIQKD protocol with random key basis(15), we observe a significant violation of a Bell inequality of S = 2.578(75)-above the classical limit of 2- and a quantum bit error rate of only 0.078(9). For the protocol, this results in a secret key rate of 0.07 bits per entanglement generation event in the asymptotic limit, and thus demonstrates the system's capability to generate secret keys. Our results of secure key exchange with potentially untrusted devices pave the way to the ultimate form of quantum secure communications in future quantum networks.

To load single atoms into optical dipole traps and then detect them by resonance fluorescence, lenses with a large numerical aperture (NA > 0.5) inside a vacuum chamber and expensive EMCCD cameras are commonly used. We present our recent experimental results on demonstrating the trapping of single Rb-87 atoms using a long-focus objective lens with a low numerical aperture (NA = 0.172) placed outside the vacuum chamber, and detecting single atoms with a low-cost sCMOS camera.

TI New physics effects on quantum coherence in neutrino oscillations
SO EUROPEAN PHYSICAL JOURNAL PLUS
AB Several measures of quantum correlations such as Leggett-Garg and Bell-type inequalities have been extensively studied in the context of neutrino oscillations. However, these analyses are performed under the assumption of standard model (SM) interactions of neutrinos. In this work, we study new physics effects on l1-norm based measure of quantum coherence which quantifies the quantumness embedded in the system and is also intrinsically related to various measures of quantum correlations. Moreover, it is considered to be a resource theoretical tool which can be utilized in quantum algorithms and quantum channel discrimination. The new physics effects are incorporated in a model independent way by using the effective Lagrangian for the neutral current non-standard neutrino interactions (NSI). Bounds on the NSI parameters are extracted from a recent global analysis of oscillation experiments including COHERENT (coherent neutrino-nucleus scattering experiment) data. In the context of upcoming DUNE experimental setup, we find that the most favourable combination of LMA-Light sector of theta 12 (i.e., theta 12<45 degrees) with normal mass ordering decreases the coherence in the system in comparison to the SM prediction for all values of neutrino energy E and CP violating phase delta (except in the narrow region around E similar to 2 GeV). On the other hand, a large enhancement in the value of coherence parameter in the entire (E-delta) plane is possible for the dark octant of theta 12 (theta 12>45 degrees) with inverted ordering. For almost all values of CP violating phase, the enhancement is more protuberant in the region around E similar to 4 GeV where maximum neutrino flux is expected in the DUNE experiment. Therefore for the normal mass ordering, the SM interaction provides favourable conditions for quantum information tasks while the NSI favours inverted ordering scenario for such tasks.

TI Bright Electrically Contacted Circular Bragg Grating Resonators with

SO ACS NANO
AB Cavity-enhanced emission of electrically controlled semiconductor quantum dots (QDs) is essential in the development of bright quantum devices for real-world quantum photonic applications. Combining the circular Bragg grating (CBG) approach with a PIN-diode structure, we propose and implement designs for ridge-based electrically contacted QD-CBG resonators. Through fine-tuning of device parameters in numerical simulations and deterministic nanoprocessing, we produced electrically controlled single QD-CBG resonators with excellent electro-optical emission properties. These include multiple wavelength-tunable emission lines and a photon extraction efficiency (PEE) of up to 30.4(3.4)%, where refined numerical optimization based on experimental findings suggests a substantial improvement, promising PEE > 50%. Additionally, the developed quantum light sources yield single-photon purity reaching 99.2(2)% and photon indistinguishability of 75(5)% under quasi-resonant p-shell excitation. Our results present high-performance quantum devices with combined cavity enhancement and deterministic charge-environment controls, which are relevant for the development of photonic quantum information systems such as complex quantum repeater networks.

TI Quantum Computing in Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) Forensics:

SO WILEY INTERDISCIPLINARY REVIEWS: FORENSIC SCIENCE
AB The continuous evolution of quantum computing has shown novel and transformative possibilities and critical implications for the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) forensic processes. With the potential to break traditional encryption algorithms and process diverse datasets at unprecedented speeds, quantum computing could disrupt current approaches to digital forensic evidence (DFE) collection, preservation, and hybrid quantum-classical data analysis methods across IIoT environments, an emerging topic in digital forensics. This paper proposes a generic quantum safe IIoT forensic (QS-IIoT-F) framework, explores the implications of quantum computing for IIoT forensics, mentions the opportunities of quantum computing in IIoT forensics, and future research directions.

TI Quantum Kerr learning
SO MACHINE LEARNING-SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB Quantum machine learning is a rapidly evolving field of research that could facilitate important applications for quantum computing and also significantly impact data-driven sciences. In our work, based on various arguments from complexity theory and physics, we demonstrate that a single Kerr mode can provide some 'quantum enhancements' when dealing with kernel-based methods. Using kernel properties, neural tangent kernel theory, first-order perturbation theory of the Kerr non-linearity, and non-perturbative numerical simulations, we show that quantum enhancements could happen in terms of convergence time and generalization error. Furthermore, we make explicit indications on how higher-dimensional input data could be considered. Finally, we propose an experimental protocol, that we call quantum Kerr learning, based on circuit QED.

TI High-Performance Telecom-Wavelength Biphoton Source from a Hot Atomic
   Vapor Cell
SO ADVANCED QUANTUM TECHNOLOGIES
AB Telecom-band quantum light sources are critical to the development of long-distance quantum communication technologies. A high-performance telecom-wavelength biphoton source from a hot 87Rb atomic vapor cell is reported. Time-correlated biphotons are generated from the cascade-type 5S1/2-5P3/2-4D5/2 transition of 87Rb via a spontaneous four-wave mixing process. The maximum value gSI(2)(tau)$g_{{\mathrm{SI}}}<^>{( 2 )}( \tau )$ of biphoton cross-correlation to be 44(3) is achieved, under the condition of a high optical depth of 112(3), including two-photon absorption, with a spectral width of approximately 300 MHz. The coincidence count rate of biphoton is estimated to be of the order of 38 000 cps mW-1. It is believed that the telecom-wavelength biphoton source from an atomic vapor cell can be applied in long-distance quantum networks and practical quantum repeaters based on atom-photon interactions.
   Introducing a groundbreaking achievement in the field of quantum optics and communication, the research unveils a high-performance telecom-wavelength biphoton source from a hot 87Rb atomic vapor cell. With its remarkable advantages of compatibility with existing telecom networks, seamless long-distance communication, exceptional efficiency, and minimal noise, the work paves the way for the realization of optical-fiber-based quantum communications and networks.image

TI Picosecond Synchronization System for the Distribution of Photon Pairs
   Through a Fiber Link Between Fermilab and Argonne National Laboratories
SO IEEE JOURNAL OF QUANTUM ELECTRONICS
AB We demonstrate a three-node quantum network for C-band photon pairs using 2 pairs of 59 km of deployed fiber between Fermi and Argonne National Laboratories. The C-band pairs are directed to nodes using a standard telecommunication switch and the detection system is synchronized to picosecond scale timing resolution using a coexisting O-or L-band optical clock distribution system. We measure a reduction of coincidence to-accidental ratio (CAR) of the C-band pairs from 51 +/- 2 to 5.3 +/- 0.4 due to Raman scattering of the O-band clock pulses. Despite this reduction, the CAR is nevertheless suitable for quantum networks.

TI Quantum machine learning regression optimisation for full-scale sewage
   sludge anaerobic digestion
SO NPJ CLEAN WATER
AB Anaerobic digestion (AD) is a crucial bioenergy source widely applied in wastewater treatment. However, its efficiency improvement is hindered by complex microbial communities and sensitivity to feedstock properties. We, thus, propose a hybrid quantum-classical machine learning (Q-CML) regression algorithm using a quantum circuit learning (QCL) strategy. Combining a variational quantum circuit with a classical optimiser, this approach predicts biogas production from operational data of 18 full-scale mesophilic AD sites in the UK. Tailored for noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices, the low-depth QCL model outperforms conventional regression methods (R-2: 0.53) and matches the performance of a classical multi-layer perceptron (MLP) regressor (R-2: 0.959) with significantly fewer parameters and better scalability. Comparative analysis highlights the advantages of quantum superposition and entanglement in capturing intricate correlations in AD data. This study positions Q-CML as a cutting-edge solution for optimising AD processes, boosting energy recovery, and driving the circular economy.

TI QUBO Modeling for a Spectrum of Domination Problems
SO JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICS
AB As quantum computing advances, the application of quantum algorithms to address combinatorial optimization problems on quantum computers has emerged as a pivotal area of research. The quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO) acts as an intermediary, facilitating the translation of combinatorial optimization problems into a quantum computing context, thereby constituting an essential foundation for this field of inquiry. Within the realm of combinatorial optimization, the domination problem (DP) is pertinent to a myriad of real-world applications, including, but not limited to, the strategic placement of fire stations and the analysis of social network structures. Furthermore, the DP encompasses a multitude of variants, exemplified by the independent DP, total DP, and k-domination, among others. However, a dearth of research exists within the quantum computing community regarding these variant problems. One plausible explanation for this gap is the absence of comprehensive QUBO modeling research pertaining to these issues. This paper delves into the methodologies of QUBO modeling for both the canonical DP and its diverse variants. For the classic DP, we have refined the existing QUBO modeling methods, addressing the issue of incomplete modeling. Additionally, we have optimized the variable representation of the slack terms in the penalty items of DP. At the same time, we introduce novel QUBO modeling methods for a spectrum of DP variants, marking a pioneering effort in this domain. Our contributions are anticipated to expedite the integration of DP into the burgeoning quantum computing landscape.

TI Majorana nanowires for topological quantum computation
SO JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYSICS
AB Majorana bound states are quasiparticle excitations localized at the boundaries of a topologically nontrivial superconductor. They are zero-energy, charge-neutral, particle-hole symmetric, and spatially-separated end modes which are topologically protected by the particle-hole symmetry of the superconducting state. Due to their topological nature, they are robust against local perturbations and, in an ideal environment, free from decoherence. Furthermore, unlike ordinary fermions and bosons, the adiabatic exchange of Majorana modes is noncommutative, i.e., the outcome of exchanging two or more Majorana modes depends on the order in which exchanges are performed. These properties make them ideal candidates for the realization of topological quantum computers. In this tutorial, I will present a pedagogical review of 1D topological superconductors and Majorana modes in quantum nanowires. I will give an overview of the Kitaev model and the more realistic Oreg-Lutchyn model, discuss the experimental signatures of Majorana modes, and highlight their relevance in the field of topological quantum computation. This tutorial may serve as a pedagogical and relatively self-contained introduction for graduate students and researchers new to the field, as well as an overview of the current state-of-the-art of the field and a reference guide to specialists.

TI Quantum Optimal Transport with Quantum Channels
SO ANNALES HENRI POINCARE
AB We propose a new generalization to quantum states of the Wasserstein distance, which is a fundamental distance between probability distributions given by the minimization of a transport cost. Our proposal is the first where the transport plans between quantum states are in natural correspondence with quantum channels, such that the transport can be interpreted as a physical operation on the system. Our main result is the proof of a modified triangle inequality for our transport distance. We also prove that the distance between a quantum state and itself is intimately connected with the Wigner-Yanase metric on the manifold of quantum states. We then specialize to quantum Gaussian systems, which provide the mathematical model for the electromagnetic radiation in the quantum regime. We prove that the noiseless quantum Gaussian attenuators and amplifiers are the optimal transport plans between thermal quantum Gaussian states, and that our distance recovers the classical Wasserstein distance in the semiclassical limit.

TI Nonclassicality and Coherent Error Detection via Pseudo-Entropy
SO ENTROPY
AB Pseudo-entropy is a complex-valued generalization of entanglement entropy defined on non-Hermitian transition operators and induced by post-selection. We present a simulation-based protocol for detecting nonclassicality and coherent errors in quantum circuits using this pseudo-entropy measure S, focusing on its imaginary part IS as a diagnostic tool. Our method enables resource-efficient classification of phase-coherent errors, such as those from miscalibrated CNOT gates, even under realistic noise conditions. By quantifying the transition between classical-like and quantum-like behavior through threshold analysis, we provide theoretical benchmarks for error classification that can inform hardware calibration strategies. Numerical simulations demonstrate that 55% of the parameter space remains classified as classical-like (below classification thresholds) at hardware-calibrated sensitivity levels, with statistical significance confirmed through rigorous sensitivity analysis. Robustness to noise and comparison with standard entropy-based methods are demonstrated in a simulation. While hardware validation remains necessary, this work bridges theoretical concepts of nonclassicality with practical quantum error classification frameworks, providing a foundation for experimental quantum computing applications.

TI External Quantum Self-Attention Model
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB Self-attention mechanisms have revolutionized machine learning domains. Quantum self-attention models have emerged as promising extensions, yet they suffer from quadratic computational complexity like their classical counterparts. To address this, we propose the External Quantum Self-Attention Model (EQSAM), which integrates external memory modules into quantum self-attention, reducing complexity from quadratic to linear. In EQSAM, two sets of fully trainable external quantum modules generate key and value memory states. The model computes similarities only between input queries and these external states, rather than pairwise among all inputs. This lowers computational demands and boosts scalability in quantum machine learning. Experiments on MNIST and Fashion MNIST classification tasks demonstrate that EQSAM achieves comparable or superior performance to pairwise quantum self-attention models with less computation. The number of external modules serves as a key hyperparameter in EQSAM, with an optimal value balancing representational capacity and generalization. Performance approaches saturation near this optimum.

TI Quantum Computing in Community Detection for Anti-Fraud Applications
SO ENTROPY
AB Fraud detection within transaction data is crucial for maintaining financial security, especially in the era of big data. This paper introduces a novel fraud detection method that utilizes quantum computing to implement community detection in transaction networks. We model transaction data as an undirected graph, where nodes represent accounts and edges indicate transactions between them. A modularity function is defined to measure the community structure of the graph. By optimizing this function through the Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) model, we identify the optimal community structure, which is then used to assess the fraud risk within each community. Using a Coherent Ising Machine (CIM) to solve the QUBO model, we successfully divide 308 nodes into four communities. We find that the CIM computes faster than the classical Louvain and simulated annealing (SA) algorithms. Moreover, the CIM achieves better community structure than Louvain and SA as quantified by the modularity function. The structure also unambiguously identifies a high-risk community, which contains almost 70% of all the fraudulent accounts, demonstrating the practical utility of the method for banks' anti-fraud business.

TI Minimizing CNOT-count in quantum circuit of the extended Shor's
   algorithm for ECDLP
SO CYBERSECURITY
AB The elliptic curve discrete logarithm problem (ECDLP) is a popular choice for cryptosystems due to its high level of security. However, with the advent of the extended Shor's algorithm, there is concern that ECDLP may soon be vulnerable. While the algorithm does offer hope in solving ECDLP, it is still uncertain whether it can pose a real threat in practice. From the perspective of the quantum circuits of the algorithm, this paper analyzes the feasibility of cracking ECDLP using an ion trap quantum computer with improved quantum circuits for the extended Shor's algorithm. We give precise quantum circuits for extended Shor's algorithm to calculate discrete logarithms on elliptic curves over prime fields, including modular subtraction, three different modular multiplication, and modular inverse. Additionally, we incorporate and improve upon windowed arithmetic in the circuits to reduce the CNOT-counts. Whereas previous studies mostly focused on minimizing the number of qubits or the depth of the circuit, we focus on minimizing the number of CNOT gates in the circuit, which greatly affects the running time of the algorithm on an ion trap quantum computer. Specifically, we begin by presenting implementations of basic arithmetic operations with the lowest known CNOT-counts, along with improved constructions for modular inverse, point addition, and windowed arithmetic. Next, we precisely estimate that, to execute the extended Shor's algorithm with the improved circuits to factor an n-bit integer, the CNOT-count required is 1237n(3)/ log n + 2n(2) + n. Finally, we analyze the running time and feasibility of the extended Shor's algorithm on an ion trap quantum computer.

TI Computable and noncomputable in the quantum domain: statements and
   conjectures
SO PHYSICS-USPEKHI
AB Significant advances in the development of computing devices based on quantum effects and the demonstration of their use to solve various problems have rekindled interest in the nature of the "quantum computational advantage." Although various attempts to quantify and characterize the nature of the quantum computational advantage have previously been made, this question largely remains open. Indeed, there is no universal approach that allows determining the scope of problems whose solution can be accelerated by quantum computers, in theory of in practice. In this paper, we consider an approach to this question based on the concept of complexity and reachability of quantum states. On the one hand, the class of quantum states that are of interest for quantum computing must be complex, i.e., not amenable to simulation by classical computers with less than exponential resources. On the other hand, such quantum states must be reachable on a practically feasible quantum computer. This means that the unitary operation that transforms the initial quantum state into the desired one must be decomposable into a sequence of one- and two-qubit gates of a length that is at most polynomial in the number of qubits. By formulating several statements and conjectures, we discuss the question of describing a class of problems whose solution can be accelerated by a quantum computer.

TI SHARC meets TEQUILA: mixed quantum-classical dynamics on a quantum
   computer using a hybrid quantum-classical algorithm
SO CHEMICAL SCIENCE
AB Recent developments in quantum computing are highly promising, particularly in the realm of quantum chemistry. Due to the noisy nature of currently available quantum hardware, hybrid quantum-classical algorithms have emerged as a reliable option for near-term simulations. Mixed quantum-classical dynamics methods effectively capture nonadiabatic effects by integrating classical nuclear dynamics with quantum chemical computations of the electronic properties. However, these methods face challenges due to the high computational cost of the quantum chemistry part. To mitigate the computational demand, we propose a method where the required electronic properties are computed through a hybrid quantum-classical approach that combines classical and quantum hardware. This framework employs the variational quantum eigensolver and variational quantum deflation algorithms to obtain ground and excited state energies, gradients, nonadiabatic coupling vectors, and transition dipole moments. These quantities are used to propagate the nonadiabatic molecular dynamics using the Tully's fewest switches surface hopping method, although the implementation is also compatible with other molecular dynamics approaches. The approach, implemented by integrating the molecular dynamics program package SHARC with the TEQUILA quantum computing framework, is validated by studying the cis-trans photoisomerization of methanimine and the electronic relaxation of ethylene. The results show qualitatively accurate molecular dynamics that align with experimental findings and other computational studies. This work is expected to mark a significant step towards achieving a "quantum advantage" for realistic chemical simulations.

TI Cosmic-ray-induced correlated errors in superconducting qubit array
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Correlated errors may devastate quantum error corrections that are necessary for the realization of fault-tolerant quantum computation. Recent experiments with superconducting qubits indicate that they can arise from quasiparticle (QP) bursts induced by cosmic-ray muons and gamma-rays. Here, we use charge-parity jump and bit flip for monitoring QP bursts and two muon detectors in the dilution refrigerator for detecting muon events. We directly observe QP bursts leading to correlated errors that are induced solely by muons and separate the contributions of muons and gamma-rays. We further investigate the dynamical process of QP burst and the impact of QP trapping on correlated errors and particle detection. The proposed method, which monitors multiqubit simultaneous charge-parity jumps, has high sensitivity to QP bursts and may find applications for the detection of cosmic-ray particles, low-mass dark matter, and far-infrared photons.

TI Quantum annealing algorithms for Boolean tensor networks
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB Quantum annealers manufactured by D-Wave Systems, Inc., are computational devices capable of finding high-quality heuristic solutions of NP-hard problems. In this contribution, we explore the potential and effectiveness of such quantum annealers for computing Boolean tensor networks. Tensors offer a natural way to model high-dimensional data commonplace in many scientific fields, and representing a binary tensor as a Boolean tensor network is the task of expressing a tensor containing categorical (i.e., (0, 1)) values as a product of low dimensional binary tensors. A Boolean tensor network is computed by Boolean tensor decomposition, and it is usually not exact. The aim of such decomposition is to minimize the given distance measure between the high-dimensional input tensor and the product of lower-dimensional (usually three-dimensional) tensors and matrices representing the tensor network. In this paper, we introduce and analyze three general algorithms for Boolean tensor networks: Tucker, Tensor Train, and Hierarchical Tucker networks. The computation of a Boolean tensor network is reduced to a sequence of Boolean matrix factorizations, which we show can be expressed as a quadratic unconstrained binary optimization problem suitable for solving on a quantum annealer. By using a novel method we introduce called parallel quantum annealing, we demonstrate that Boolean tensor's with up to millions of elements can be decomposed efficiently using a DWave 2000Q quantum annealer.

TI First Hitting Times on a Quantum Computer: Tracking vs. Local
   Monitoring, Topological Effects, and Dark States
SO ENTROPY
AB We investigate a quantum walk on a ring represented by a directed triangle graph with complex edge weights and monitored at a constant rate until the quantum walker is detected. To this end, the first hitting time statistics are recorded using unitary dynamics interspersed stroboscopically by measurements, which are implemented on IBM quantum computers with a midcircuit readout option. Unlike classical hitting times, the statistical aspect of the problem depends on the way we construct the measured path, an effect that we quantify experimentally. First, we experimentally verify the theoretical prediction that the mean return time to a target state is quantized, with abrupt discontinuities found for specific sampling times and other control parameters, which has a well-known topological interpretation. Second, depending on the initial state, system parameters, and measurement protocol, the detection probability can be less than one or even zero, which is related to dark-state physics. Both return-time quantization and the appearance of the dark states are related to degeneracies in the eigenvalues of the unitary time evolution operator. We conclude that, for the IBM quantum computer under study, the first hitting times of monitored quantum walks are resilient to noise. However, a finite number of measurements leads to broadening effects, which modify the topological quantization and chiral effects of the asymptotic theory with an infinite number of measurements.

TI Dispersion cancellation in a quantum interferometer with independent
   single photons
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB A key technique to perform proper quantum information processing is to get a high visibility quantum interference between independent single photons. One of the crucial elements that affects the quantum interference is a group velocity dispersion that occurs when single photons pass through a dispersive medium. We theoretically and experimentally demonstrate that an effect of group velocity dispersion on the two-photon interference can be cancelled if two independent single photons experience the same amount of pulse broadening. This dispersion cancellation effect can be applied to a multi-path linear interferometer with multiple independent single photons. As multi-path quantum interferometers are at the heart of quantum communication, photonic quantum computing, and boson sampling applications, our work should find wide applicability in quantum information science.

AB We present short-depth quantum circuits to deter-ministically prepare any Dicke state vertical bar D-k(n)>, which is the equal-amplitude superposition of all n-qubit computational basis states with Hamming Weight k. Dicke states are an important class of entangled quantum states with a large variety of applications, and a long history of experimental creation in physical systems. On the other hand, not much is known regarding efficient scalable quantum circuits for Dicke state preparation on realistic quantum computing hardware connectivities.
   Concretely, we present preparation circuits for Dicke states vertical bar D-k(n)> with (i) depth of O(k log n/k) for all-to-all connectivity (such as on current ion trap devices); (ii) depth of O(k root n/k) = O (root nk) for Grid connectivity on grids of size Omega (root n/2) x O(root ns) with s <= k (such as on most current superconducting qubit devices).
   Both approaches have a total gate count of O(kn), need no ancilla qubits, and generalize to preparation and compression of those symmetric pure states, in which all non-zero amplitudes correspond to states with Hamming weight at most k. Our work significantly improves and expands previous state-of-the art circuits which had depth O(n) on a Linear Nearest Neighbor connectivity for arbitrary k (FCT 2019 [4]) and depth O(logn) on all-to-all connectivity for k =1 (AQT 2019 [9]).

TI Lightweight Computational Complexity Stepping Up the NTRU Post-Quantum
   Algorithm Using Parallel Computing
SO SYMMETRY-BASEL
AB The Nth-degree Truncated polynomial Ring Unit (NTRU) is one of the famous post-quantum cryptographic algorithms. Researchers consider NTRU to be the most important parameterized family of lattice-based public key cryptosystems that has been established to the IEEE P1363 standards. Lattice-based protocols necessitate operations on large vectors, which makes parallel computing one of the appropriate solutions to speed it up. NTRUEncrypt operations contain a large amount of data that requires many repetitive arithmetic operations. These operations make it a strong candidate to take advantage of the high degree of parallelism. The main costly operation that is repeated in all NTRU algorithm steps is polynomial multiplication. In this work, a Parallel Post-Quantum NTRUEncrypt algorithm called PPQNTRUEncrypt is proposed. This algorithm exploits the capabilities of parallel computing to accelerate the NTRUEncrypt algorithm. Both analytical and Apache Spark simulation models are used. The proposed algorithm enhanced the NTRUEncrypt algorithm by approximately 49.5%, 74.5%, 87.6%, 92.5%, 93.4%, and 94.5%, assuming that the number of processing elements is 2, 4, 8, 12, 16, and 20 respectively.

TI Hybrid quantum-classical computation for automatic guided vehicles
   scheduling
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB Motivated by recent efforts to develop quantum computing for practical, industrial-scale challenges, we demonstrate the effectiveness of state-of-the-art hybrid (not necessarily quantum) solvers in addressing the business-centric optimization problem of scheduling Automatic Guided Vehicles (AGVs). Some solvers can already leverage noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices. In our study, we utilize D-Wave hybrid solvers that implement classical heuristics with potential assistance from a quantum processing unit. This hybrid methodology performs comparably to existing classical solvers. However, due to the proprietary nature of the software, the precise contribution of quantum computation remains unclear. Our analysis focuses on a practical, business-oriented scenario: scheduling AGVs within a factory constrained by limited space, simulating a realistic production setting. Our approach maps a realistic AGVs problem onto one reminiscent of railway scheduling and demonstrates that the AGVs problem is better suited to quantum computing than its railway counterpart, the latter being denser in terms of the average number of constraints per variable. The main idea here is to highlight the potential usefulness of a hybrid approach for handling AGVs scheduling problems of practical sizes. We show that a scenario involving up to 21 AGVs, significant due to possible deadlocks, can be efficiently addressed by a hybrid solver in seconds.

TI Influence of source intensity errors in unidimensional Gaussian
   modulation continuous-variable quantum key distribution
SO ACTA PHYSICA SINICA
AB Unidimensional Gaussian modulation continuous-variable quantum key distribution (UD CV-QKD) uses only one modulator to encode information. The UD CV-QKD has the advantages of low implementation cost and low random number consumption, making it attractive for the construction of future miniaturized and low-cost large-scale quantum communication networks. However, in the actual application of the protocol, the intensity fluctuation of the source pulsed light, device defects, and external environmental interference maybe lead to the generation of source intensity errors, thereby affecting the realistic security and performance of the protocol. To solve these problems, the security and performance of UD CV-QKD are studied in depth under source intensity errors in this work. The mechanism of source intensity errors influencing the protocol parameter estimation process is analyzed. To make it possible that the protocol can operate stably under various realistic conditions and ensure communication security, three practical assumptions about the sender's abilities are made in this work, and corresponding data optimization processing schemes for these assumptions are proposed to reduce the negative influence of source intensity errors. Additionally, both source errors and finite-size effect are comprehensively considered to ensure the realistic security of the system. The simulation results indicate that the source intensity errors cannot be neglected and the maximum transmission distance of the system will be reduced by approximately 20 km for significant intensity fluctuations. Therefore, in the practical implementation of the protocol, the influence of source intensity errors must be fully considered, and the corresponding countermeasures should be taken to reduce or even eliminate these errors. This study provides theoretical guidance for securely implementing the UD CV-QKD in real-world environments.

This approach overcomes challenges associated with structuring traditional single-crystal quantum sensing platforms and enables the creation of complex, fully three-dimensional, sensor assemblies with submicroscale resolutions (down to 400 nm) and large fields of view (>1 mm). By embedding NV center-containing nanoparticles in exemplary structures, we demonstrate high sensitivity optical sensing of temperature and magnetic fields at the microscale. Our work showcases the potential for integrating quantum sensors with advanced manufacturing techniques, facilitating the incorporation of sensors into existing microfluidic and electronic platforms, and opening new avenues for widespread utilization of quantum sensors in various applications.

TI Geometric Refactoring of Quantum and Reversible Circuits Using Graph
   Algorithms
SO IEICE TRANSACTIONS ON INFORMATION AND SYSTEMS
AB With the advent of gated quantum computers and the regular structures for qubit layout, methods for placement, routing, noise estimation, and logic to hardware mapping become imminently required. In this paper, we propose a method for quantum circuit layout that is intended to solve such problems when mapping a quantum circuit to a gated quantum computer. The proposed methodology starts by building a Circuit Interaction Graph (CIG) that represents the ideal hardware layout minimizing the distance and path length between the individual qubits. The CIG is also used to introduce a qubit noise model. Once constructed, the CIG is iteratively reduced to a given architecture (qubit coupling model) specifying the neighborhood, qubits, priority, and qubits noise. The introduced constraints allow us to additionally reduce the graph according to preferred weights of desired properties. We propose two different methods of reducing the CIG: iterative reduction or the iterative isomorphism search algorithm. The proposed method is verified and tested on a set of standard benchmarks with results showing improvement on certain functions while in average improving the cost of the implementation over the current state of the art methods.

TI Adaptive Bayesian quantum algorithm for phase estimation
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Quantum -phase -estimation algorithms are critical subroutines in many applications for quantum computers and in quantum -metrology protocols. These algorithms estimate the unknown strength of a unitary evolution. By using coherence or entanglement to sample the unitary N tot times, the variance of the estimates can scale as O (1 / N 2tot ), compared to the best "classical" strategy with O (1 / N tot ). The original algorithm for quantum phase estimation cannot be implemented on near -term hardware as it requires large-scale entangled probes and fault -tolerant quantum computing. Therefore, alternative algorithms have been introduced that rely on coherence and statistical inference. These algorithms produce quantum -boosted phase estimates without interprobe entanglement. This family of phase -estimation algorithms have, until now, never exhibited the possibility of achieving optimal scaling O (1 / N 2tot ). Moreover, previous works have not considered the effect of noise on these algorithms. Here, we present a coherence -based phase -estimation algorithm which can achieve the optimal quadratic scaling in the mean absolute error and the mean squared error. In the presence of noise, our algorithm produces errors that approach the theoretical lower bound. The optimality of our algorithm stems from its adaptive nature: Each step is determined, iteratively, using a Bayesian protocol that analizes the results of previous steps.

TI Introducing structure to expedite quantum searching
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB We present a quantum algorithm for solving the unstructured search problem with one marked element. Our algorithm allows generating quantum circuits that use asymptotically fewer additional quantum gates than the famous Grover's algorithm and may be successfully executed on noisy intermediate-scale quantum devices. We prove that our algorithm is optimal in the total number of elementary gates up to a multiplicative constant. As many NP-hard problems are, in fact, not unstructured, we also describe the partial uncotnpute technique which exploits the oracle structure and allows a significant reduction in the number of elementary gates required to find the solution. Combining these results allows us to use an asymptotically smaller number of elementary gates than Grover's algorithm in various applications, keeping the number of queries to the oracle essentially the same. We show how the results can be applied to solve hard combinatorial problems, for example, Unique k-SAT. Additionally, we show how to asymptotically reduce the number of elementary gates required to solve the unstructured search problem with multiple marked elements.

TI Quantum Distributed Unit Commitment: An Application in Microgrids
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON POWER SYSTEMS
AB The dawn of quantum computing brings on a revolution in the way combinatorially complex power system problems such as Unit Commitment are solved. The Unit Commitment problem complexity is expected to increase in the future because of the trend toward the increase of penetration of intermittent renewables. Even though quantum computing has proven effective for solving a host of problems, its applications for power systems' problems have been rather limited. In this paper, a quantum unit commitment is innovatively formulated and the quantum version of the decomposition and coordination alternate direction method of multipliers (ADMM) is established. The above is achieved by devising quantum algorithms and by exploiting the superposition and entanglement of quantum bits (qubits) for solving subproblems, which are then coordinated through ADMM to obtain feasible solutions. The main contributions of this paper include: 1) the innovative development of a quantum model for Unit Commitment; 2) development of decomposition and coordination-supported framework which paves the way for the utilization of limited quantum resources to potentially solve the large-scale discrete optimization problems; 3) devising the novel quantum distributed unit commitment (QDUC) to solve the problem in a larger scale than currently available quantum computers are capable of solving. The QDUC results are compared with those from its classical counterpart, which validate the efficacy of quantum computing.

TI Protectability of IBMQ Qubits by Dynamical Decoupling Technique
SO SYMMETRY-BASEL
AB We study the current effectiveness of the dynamical decoupling technique on a publicly accessible IBM quantum computer (IBMQ). This technique, also known as bang-bang decoupling or dynamical symmetrization, consists of applying sequences of pulses for protecting a qubit from decoherence by symmetrizing the qubit-environment interactions. Works in the field have studied sequences with different symmetries and carried out tests on IBMQ devices typically considering single-qubit states. We show that the simplest universal sequences can be interesting for preserving two-qubit states on the IBMQ device. For this, we considered a collection of single-qubit and two-qubit states. The results indicate that a simple dynamical decoupling approach using available IBMQ pulses is not enough for protecting a general single-qubit state without further care. Nevertheless, the technique is beneficial for the Bell states. This encouraged us to study logical qubit encodings such as {|0 > L equivalent to 01 >,|1 > L equivalent to|10 >, where a quantum state has the form |psi ab >=a|0 > L+b|1 > L. Thus, we explored the effectiveness of dynamical decoupling with a large set of two-qubit |psi ab > states, where a and b are real amplitudes. With this, we also determined that the |psi ab > states most benefiting from this dynamical decoupling approach and slowed down the decay of their survival probability.

TI Experimental quantum communication enhancement by superposing
   trajectories
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB In quantum communication networks, wires represent well-defined trajectories along which quantum systems are transmitted. In spite of this, trajectories can be used as a quantum control to govern the order of different noisy communication channels, and such a control has been shown to enable the transmission of information even when quantum communication protocols through well-defined trajectories fail. This result has motivated further investigations on the role of the superposition of trajectories in enhancing communication, which revealed that the use of quantum control of parallel communication channels, or of channels in series with quantum-controlled operations, can also lead to communication advantages. Building upon these findings, here we experimentally and numerically compare different ways in which two trajectories through a pair of noisy channels can be superposed. We observe that, within the framework of quantum interferometry, the use of channels in series with quantum-controlled operations generally yields the largest advantages. Our results contribute to clarify the nature of these advantages in experimental quantum-optical scenarios, and showcase the benefit of an extension of the quantum communication paradigm in which both the information exchanged and the trajectory of the information carriers are quantum.

TI Projective robustness for quantum channels and measurements and their
   operational significance
SO LASER PHYSICS LETTERS
AB Recently, the projective robustness of quantum states was introduced in (Regula 2022 Phys. Rev. Lett. 128 110505). This demonstrates that the projective robustness is a useful resource monotone and can comprehensively characterize the capabilities and limitations of probabilistic protocols that manipulate quantum resources deterministically. In this paper, we will extend the projective robustness to any convex resource theory of quantum channels and measurements. First, we introduce the projective robustness of quantum channels and prove that it satisfies some good properties, especially sub-multiplicativity under any free quantum process. Moreover, we show that the projective robustness of channels quantifies the maximal advantage that a given channel outperforms all free channels in the simultaneous discrimination and exclusion of a fixed-state ensemble. Second, we define the projective robustness of quantum measurements and prove that it exactly quantifies the maximal advantage that a given measurement outperforms all free measurements in the simultaneous discrimination and exclusion of two fixed-state ensembles. Finally, within a specific channel resource setting based on measurement incompatibility, we show that the projective robustness of quantum channels coincides with the projective robustness of measurement incompatibility.

TI Introducing the kernel descent optimizer for variational quantum
   algorithms
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB In recent years, variational quantum algorithms have garnered significant attention as a candidate approach for near-term quantum advantage using noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices. In this article we introduce kernel descent, a novel algorithm for minimizing the functions underlying variational quantum algorithms. We compare kernel descent to existing methods and carry out extensive experiments to demonstrate its effectiveness. In particular, we showcase scenarios in which kernel descent outperforms gradient descent and quantum analytic descent. The algorithm follows the well-established scheme of iteratively computing classical local approximations to the objective function and subsequently executing several classical optimization steps with respect to the former. Kernel descent sets itself apart with its employment of reproducing kernel Hilbert space techniques in the construction of the local approximations, which leads to the observed advantages.

TI Decoherence-assisted quantum key distribution
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB We put forward and demonstrate a controllable decoherence-assisted quantum key distribution scheme. The protocol is based on the possibility of introducing controllable decoherence to polarization qubits using the spatial degree of freedom of light. We show that our method reduces the amount of information that an eavesdropper can obtain in the BB84 protocol under the entangling probe attack. We demonstrate experimentally that Alice and Bob can agree on a scheme that gives low values of the quantum bit error rate, despite the presence of a large amount of decoherence in the transmission channel of the BB84 protocol.

TI Ergodic and Nonergodic Dual-Unitary Quantum Circuits with Arbitrary
   Local Hilbert Space Dimension
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB Dual-unitary quantum circuits can be used to construct 1 +/- 1 dimensional lattice models for which dynamical correlations of local observables can be explicitly calculated. We show how to analytically construct classes of dual-unitary circuits with any desired level of (non-)ergodicity for any dimension of the local Hilbert space, and present analytical results for thermalization to an infinite-temperature Gibbs state (ergodic) and a generalized Gibbs ensemble (nonergodic). It is shown how a tunable ergodicity-inducing perturbation can be added to a nonergodic circuit without breaking dual unitarity, leading to the appearance of prethermalization plateaux for local observables.

TI Power-Law Entanglement and Hilbert Space Fragmentation in Nonreciprocal
   Quantum Circuits
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB Quantum circuits utilizing measurement to evolve a quantum wave function offer a new and rich playground to engineer unconventional entanglement dynamics. Here, we introduce a hybrid, nonreciprocal setup featuring a quantum circuit, whose updates are conditioned on the state of a classical dynamical agent. In our example the circuit is represented by a Majorana quantum chain controlled by a classical N- state Potts chain undergoing pair flips. The local orientation of the classical spins controls whether randomly drawn local measurements on the quantum chain are allowed or not. This imposes a dynamical kinetic constraint on the entanglement growth, described by the transfer matrix of an N- colored loop model. It yields an equivalent description of the circuit by an SU ( N )-symmetric Temperley-Lieb Hamiltonian or by a kinetically constrained surface growth model for an N- component height field. For N = 2 , we find a diffusive growth of the half-chain entanglement toward a stationary profile S(L) ( L ) L 1 = 2 for L sites. For N >= 3 , the kinetic constraints impose Hilbert space fragmentation, yielding subdiffusive growth toward S(L) ( L ) L 0 . 57 . This showcases how the control by a classical dynamical agent can enrich the entanglement dynamics in quantum circuits, paving a route toward novel entanglement dynamics in nonreciprocal hybrid circuit architectures.

TI Neural networks with quantum states of light
SO PHILOSOPHICAL TRANSACTIONS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY A-MATHEMATICAL PHYSICAL
   AND ENGINEERING SCIENCES
AB Quantum optical networks are instrumental in addressing the fundamental questions and enable applications ranging from communication to computation and, more recently, machine learning (ML). In particular, photonic artificial neural networks (ANNs) offer the opportunity to exploit the advantages of both classical and quantum optics. Photonic neuro-inspired computation and ML have been successfully demonstrated in classical settings, while quantum optical networks have triggered breakthrough applications such as teleportation, quantum key distribution and quantum computing. We present a perspective on the state of the art in quantum optical ML and the potential advantages of ANNs in circuit designs and beyond, in more general, analogue settings characterized by recurrent and coherent complex interactions. We consider two analogue neuro-inspired applications, namely quantum reservoir computing and quantum associative memories, and discuss the enhanced capabilities offered by quantum substrates, highlighting the specific role of light squeezing in this context.This article is part of the theme issue 'The quantum theory of light'.

TI Non-Abelian braiding of Fibonacci anyons with a superconducting
   processor
SO NATURE PHYSICS
AB Quantum many-body systems with a non-Abelian topological order can host anyonic quasiparticles. It has been proposed that anyons could be used to encode and manipulate information in a topologically protected manner that is immune to local noise, with quantum gates performed by braiding and fusing anyons. Unfortunately, realizing non-Abelian topologically ordered states is challenging, and it was not until recently that the signatures of non-Abelian statistics were observed through digital quantum simulation approaches. However, not all forms of topological order can be used to realize universal quantum computation. Here we use a superconducting quantum processor to simulate non-Abelian topologically ordered states of the Fibonacci string-net model and demonstrate braidings of Fibonacci anyons featuring universal computational power. We demonstrate the non-trivial topological nature of the quantum states by measuring the topological entanglement entropy. In addition, we create two pairs of Fibonacci anyons and demonstrate their fusion rule and non-Abelian braiding statistics by applying unitary gates on the underlying physical qubits. Our results establish a digital approach to explore non-Abelian topological states and their associated braiding statistics with current noisy intermediate-scale quantum processors.
   Superconducting qubits have been used to realize a quantum many-body state that is capable of universal topological quantum computation.

TI Quantum generative adversarial networks with multiple superconducting

SO NPJ QUANTUM INFORMATION
AB Generative adversarial networks are an emerging technique with wide applications in machine learning, which have achieved dramatic success in a number of challenging tasks including image and video generation. When equipped with quantum processors, their quantum counterparts-called quantum generative adversarial networks (QGANs)-may even exhibit exponential advantages in certain machine learning applications. Here, we report an experimental implementation of a QGAN using a programmable superconducting processor, in which both the generator and the discriminator are parameterized via layers of single- and two-qubit quantum gates. The programmed QGAN runs automatically several rounds of adversarial learning with quantum gradients to achieve a Nash equilibrium point, where the generator can replicate data samples that mimic the ones from the training set. Our implementation is promising to scale up to noisy intermediate-scale quantum devices, thus paving the way for experimental explorations of quantum advantages in practical applications with near-term quantum technologies.

TI Virtual quantum error detection
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Quantum error correction and quantum error detection necessitate syndrome measurements to detect errors. Performing syndrome measurements for each stabilizer generator can be a significant overhead, considering the fact that the readout fidelity in the current quantum hardware is generally lower than gate fidelity. Here, by generalizing a quantum error mitigation method known as symmetry expansion, we propose a protocol called virtual quantum error detection (VQED). This method virtually allows for evaluating computation results corresponding to postselected quantum states obtained through quantum error detection during circuit execution, without implementing syndrome measurements. Unlike conventional quantum error detection, which requires the implementation of Hadamard test circuits for each stabilizer generator, our VQED protocol can be performed with a constant depth shallow quantum circuit with an ancilla qubit, irrespective of the number of stabilizer generators. Furthermore, for some simple error models, the computation results obtained using VQED are robust against the noise that occurred during the operation of VQED, and our method is fully compatible with other error mitigation schemes, enabling further improvements in computation accuracy and facilitating high-fidelity quantum computing.

TI Optimizing qubit performance through smoothing techniques
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB This study explores an approach to enhance the performance of qubits by leveraging signal smoothing algorithms applied to qubit chips. The primary aim is to mitigate experimental variability and enhance overall stability, tied to the improvement of the Hamiltonian spectrum. By optimizing qubit operation through smoothing techniques, data processing for subsequent stages of two-tone qubit spectroscopy data transformation is facilitated. Specifically, through the subsequent pipeline of calibration transformations for resonator frequency, qubit frequency, qubit amplitude calibrations, and refinement of qubit frequency via Ramsey oscillations, qubit state calibration can be achieved. This, in turn, improves qubit coherence time during measurement. This is because smoothing allows for a more precise determination of the Hamiltonian spectrum on two-tone spectroscopy maps, thereby enabling more accurate parameter construction.

AB Measurement-based quantum computing (MBQC) is a promising quantum computing paradigm that carries out computation through one-way measurements on entangled photon qubits. Practical photonic hardware first generates a 2D mesh of resource states with each being a small number of entangled photon qubits and then exploits fusion operations to connect resource states to scale up the computation. Given that the fusion operation is highly error-prone, it is important to reduce the number of fusions for an MBQC circuit. In this paper, we propose FCM, a fusion-aware scheme that exploits wire cutting to improve the fidelity of MBQC. By cutting a large MBQC circuit into several smaller subcircuits, FCM effectively reduces the number of fusions in each subcircuit and thus improves the computation fidelity. Given circuit cutting requires classical post-processing to combine the results of subcircuits, FCM strives to achieve the best cutting strategy under different settings. Evaluation of representative benchmarks demonstrates that, when cutting a large circuit to two subcircuits, FCM reduces the maximum number of fusions of all subcircuits by 59.6% on average (up to 69.1%).

TI Robust biometric identity authentication scheme using quantum voice
   encryption and quantum secure direct communications for cybersecurity
SO JOURNAL OF KING SAUD UNIVERSITY-COMPUTER AND INFORMATION SCIENCES
AB A significant problem facing cybersecurity is that most client/server identity authentication schemes depend on computational complexity which is recently challenged by the super exponential computational abilities of quantum computers. Quantum cryptography with its quantum mechanics principles solves this problem and provides mathematically un-hackable secure communication for the quantum computers epoch. Biometric authentication has a big challenge related to its protection as it has to be submitted and stored in encrypted form. Unfortunately, most existing biometric cryptosystems rely on classical cryptography, so they are insecure in quantum era. This problem is solved in this paper by introducing a novel three-factor biometric quantum identity authentication scheme combining something you know (password), something you produce (client 's voice), and something you are (client 's face image) is proposed. The scheme consists of two phases: client enrollment and client login/authentication. The methodology is to use in the enrollment phase, two layers of quantum encryption for the client 's voice signal. Each layer consists of two simple quantum circuits of SWAP and C-NOT quantum gates respectively using a different pseudorandom key obtained from a cellular automata (CA) pseudorandom generator. The proposed scheme has many merits. Firstly, it introduces a new design of muti-factors quantum biometric authentication scheme as the biometric voice data is processed, transmitted, and stored at the server database in an encrypted unconditionally secure quantum form which provides parallel processing, realtime communications, inherent level of security against attacks, tamper-proof security and exponential powerful storage capability due to the quantum properties. Secondly, the proposed scheme achieves double-layers security by combing quantum voice encryption and quantum secure direct communication in one process such that the quantum channel eavesdropper cannot obtain any valuable information in case of information leakage. Thirdly , the distribution and management of encryption key problem is solved as there is no need for key exchange prior to communication. Fourthly, it achieves high communication efficiency as although it is a three-factor biometric identity authentication, only one biometric data is sent in quantum encrypted form to the server . Fifthly , the numerical simulations showed that the proposed scheme has large key space, high key sensitivity and more robust performance against different types of attacks compared to other existing classical and quantum voice encryption schemes. Finally, as an identity authentication method, the proposed scheme achieves identification accuracy of 100% with zero False Rejection Rate (FRR) and zero False acceptance rate (FAR) which is perfect.

TI Scattering phase shifts from a quantum computer
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW C
AB We calculate two-body scattering phase shifts on a quantum computer using a leading order short-range effective field theory Hamiltonian. The algorithm combines the variational quantum eigensolver and the quantum subspace expansion. As an example, we consider scattering in the deuteron 3S1 partial wave. We calculate scattering phase shifts with a quantum simulator and on real hardware. We also study how noise impacts these calculations and discuss noise mitigation required to extend our work to larger quantum processing units. With current hardware, up to five superconducting qubits can produce acceptable results, and larger calculations will require a significant noise reduction.

TI Optical Spin Initialization of Nitrogen Vacancy Centers in a
   28Si-Enriched 6H-SiC Crystal for Quantum Technologies
SO JETP LETTERS
AB High-spin defect centers in crystal matrices are used in quantum computing technologies, highly sensitive sensors, and single-photon sources. In this work, optically active nitrogen-vacancy color centers NV- in a Si-28-enriched (nuclear spin I = 0) 6H-(SiC)-Si-28 crystal have been studied using the photoinduced (lambda = 980 nm) high-frequency (94 GHz, 3.4 T) pulsed electron paramagnetic resonance method at a temperature of T = 150 K. Three structurally nonequivalent types of NV- centers with axial symmetry have been identified and their spectroscopic parameters have been determined. Long spin-lattice, T-1 = 1.3 ms, and spin-spin, T-2 = 59 mu s, ensemble relaxation times of NV- centers with extremely narrow (450 kHz) absorption lines allow highly selective excitation of resonant transitions between sublevels (m(I)) caused by the weak hyperfine interaction (A approximate to 1 MHz) with N-14 (I = 1) nuclei for the quantum manipulation of the electron spin magnetization.

TI Fundamental bounds on qubit reset
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Qubit reset is a key task in the operation of quantum devices which, for many quantum hardware platforms, presently limits device clock speed. While it is known that coupling the qubit to an ancilla on demand allows for the fastest qubit reset, the limits on reset accuracy and speed due to the choice of ancilla have not yet been identified-despite the great flexibility in device design for most quantum hardware platforms. Here, we derive bounds on qubit reset in terms of maximum fidelity and minimum time, assuming control over the qubit and no control over the ancilla. For two-level ancillas, we find a provably time-optimal protocol which consists of purity exchange between qubit and ancilla brought into resonance. The globally minimal time can only be realized for specific choices of coupling and control which we identify. When increasing the size of the ancilla Hilbert space, the maximally achievable fidelity increases, whereas the reset time remains constant. Our results translate into device design principles for realizing, in a given quantum architecture, the fastest and most accurate protocol for qubit reset.

AB Quantum computer chip based on spin qubits in diamond uses modules that are entangled with on-chip optical links. This enables an increased connectivity and a negligible crosstalk and error-rate when the number of qubits increases on-chip. Here, 3D integration is the key enabling technology for a large-scale integration of the diamond spin qubits with photonic and electronic circuits for routing, control and readout of qubits. There are several engineering challenges to integrate the large number of spins in diamond with the on-chip circuits operating at a cryogenic temperature. In this paper we will address challenges, present recent results and discuss future outlook of the integration technology for realization of a scalable quantum computer based on diamond spin qubits.

TI Advances in quantum imaging
SO NATURE PHOTONICS
AB Modern imaging technologies are widely based on classical principles of light or electromagnetic wave propagation. They can be remarkably sophisticated, with recent successes ranging from single-molecule microscopy to imaging far-distant galaxies. However, new imaging technologies based on quantum principles are gradually emerging. They can either surpass classical approaches or provide novel imaging capabilities that would not otherwise be possible. Here we provide an overview of the most recently developed quantum imaging systems, highlighting the nonclassical properties of sources, such as bright squeezed light, entangled photons and single-photon emitters that enable their functionality. We outline potential upcoming trends and the associated challenges, all driven by a central enquiry, which is to understand whether quantum light can make visible the invisible.

TI Improving Wireless Sensor Network Security Using Quantum Key
   Distribution
SO BAGHDAD SCIENCE JOURNAL
AB Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) are promoting the spread of the Internet for devices in all areas of life, which makes it is a promising technology in the future. In the coming days, as attack technologies become more improved, security will have an important role in WSN. Currently, quantum computers pose a significant risk to current encryption technologies that work in tandem with intrusion detection systems because it is difficult to implement quantum properties on sensors due to the resource limitations. In this paper, quantum computing is used to develop a future-proof, robust, lightweight and resource-conscious approach to sensor networks. Great emphasis is placed on the concepts of using the BB84 protocol with the AES algorithm in WSN security. The results of analysis indicated a high level of security between the data by depending on the generation of secure keys, and reached an accuracy rate of about (80-95) % based on using NIST statistical. The efficiency of the work increased to 0.704 after using the Quantum Bit Error Rate equation, eventually increasing the network performance. This results in the reduction of the overall amount of energy, and the time required for performing the key exchange in the encryption and decryption processes decreased.

TI Quantum-inspired Probabilistic Database Corruption Detection

AB A crucial problem of machine learning is the management of unclean probabilistic databases. We approach this problem by applying recent results and methods from quantum information to detect a specific class of database corruption. We present a quantifier of the global corruption of the probabilistic database and show its relationship with detection protocols based on generalized Bell inequalities. Furthermore, we show a relation between the noise generating the corruption and information encoded in the database schema. Finally, we discuss how our work indicates a way to export quantum information results to study noise in probabilistic databases.

TI Remotely Establishing Polarization Entanglement Over Noisy Polarization
   Channels
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW APPLIED
AB The faithful distribution of entanglement over noisy channels is a vital prerequisite for many quantum technological applications. Quantum information can be encoded in different degrees of freedom (DOF) of photons, where each encoding comes with its own advantages and disadvantages with respect to noise resilience and practicality in manipulation. In this work, we experimentally implement a deterministic entanglement purification protocol that allows us to faithfully distribute entanglement in one DOF over a noisy channel and then remotely transfer it to another DOF for manipulation. In particular, we distribute robust energy-time entanglement and transfer it to polarization entanglement at the communicating parties. The remotely obtained polarization state is independent of the polarization noise during distribution and reaches fidelities to a Bell state of up to 97.6%. Our scheme enables robust and efficient polarization entanglement distribution in the presence of arbitrary polarization noise, which is relevant for future large-scale quantum networks.

TI Quantum-Solving Algorithm for d'Alembert Solutions of the Wave Equation
SO ENTROPY
AB When faced with a quantum-solving problem for partial differential equations, people usually transform such problems into Hamiltonian simulation problems or quantum-solving problems for linear equation systems. In this paper, we propose a third approach to solving partial differential equations that differs from the two approaches. By using the duality quantum algorithm, we construct a quantum-solving algorithm for solving the first-order wave equation, which represents a typical class of partial differential equations. Numerical results of the quantum circuit have high precision consistency with the theoretical d'Alembert solution. Then the routine is applied to the wave equation with either a dissipation or dispersion term. As shown by complexity analysis for all these cases of the wave equation, our algorithm has a quadratic acceleration for each iteration compared to the classical algorithm.

TI Integrating micromagnets and hybrid nanowires for topological quantum
   computing
SO SCIPOST PHYSICS
AB Majorana zero modes are expected to arise in semiconductor-superconductor hybrid systems, with potential topological quantum computing applications. One limitation of this approach is the need for a relatively high external magnetic field that should also change direction at the nanoscale. This proposal considers devices that incorporate micromagnets to address this challenge. We perform numerical simulations of stray magnetic fields from different micromagnet configurations, which are then used to solve for Majorana wavefunctions. Several devices are proposed, starting with the basic four-magnet design to align magnetic field with the nanowire and scaling up to nanowire T-junctions. The feasibility of the approach is assessed by performing magnetic imaging of prototype patterns.

TI Tighter lower bounds on quantum annealing times
SO SCIPOST PHYSICS
AB We derive lower bounds on the time needed for a quantum annealer to prepare the ground state of a target Hamiltonian. These bounds do not depend on the annealing schedule and can take the local structure of the Hamiltonian into account. Consequently, the bounds are computable without knowledge of the annealer's dynamics and, in certain cases, scale with the size of the system. We discuss spin systems where the bounds are polynomially tighter than existing bounds, qualitatively capturing the scaling of the exact annealing times as a function of the number of spins.

AB Quantum networking at many scales will be critical to future quantum technologies and experiments on quantum systems. Photonic links enable quantum networking. They will connect co-located quantum processors to enable large-scale quantum computers, provide links between distant quantum computers to support distributed, delegated, and blind quantum computing, and will link distant nodes in space enabling new tests of fundamental physics. Here, we discuss recent work advancing photonic tools and protocols that support quantum networking. We provide analytical results and numerics for the effect of distinguishability errors on key photonic circuits; we considered a variety of error models and developed new metrics for benchmarking the quality of generated photonic states. We review a distillation protocol by one of the authors that mitigates distinguishability errors. We also review recent results by a subset of the authors on the efficient simulation of photonic circuits via approximation by coherent states. We study some interactions between the theory of universal sets, unitary t-designs, and photonics: while many of the results we state in this direction may be known to experts, we aim to bring them to the attention of the broader quantum information science community and to phrase them in ways that are more familiar to this community. We prove, translating a result from representation theory, that there are no non-universal infinite closed 2-designs in U(V) when dim V >= 2. As a consequence, we observe that linear optical unitaries form a 1-design but not a 2-design. Finally, we apply a result of Oszmaniec and Zimboras to prove that augmenting the linear optical unitaries with any nontrivial SNAP gate is sufficient to achieve universality.

CY JUN 07-11, 2021
CL POLAND
AB The ZX-calculus was introduced as a graphical language able to represent specific quantum primi-tives in an intuitive way. The recent completeness results have shown the theoretical possibility of a purely graphical description of quantum processes. However, in practice, such approaches are lim-ited by the intrinsic low level nature of ZX calculus. The scalable notations have been proposed as an attempt to recover an higher level point of view while maintaining the topological rewriting rules of a graphical language. We demonstrate that the scalable ZX-calculus provides a formal, intuitive, and compact framework to describe and prove quantum algorithms. As a proof of concept, we con-sider the standard oracle-based quantum algorithms: Deutsch-Jozsa, Bernstein-Vazirani, Simon, and Grover algorithms, and we show they can be described and proved graphically.

TI Practical Real-Time Phase Drift Compensation Scheme for Quantum

SO ENTROPY
AB Quantum communication systems are susceptible to various perturbations and drifts arising from the operational environment, with phase drift being a crucial challenge. In this paper, we propose an efficient real-time phase drift compensation scheme in which only existing data from the quantum communication process is used to establish a stable closed-loop control subsystem for phase tracking. This scheme ensures the continuous operation of transmission by tracking and compensating for phase drift in the phase-encoding quantum communication system. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and feasibility of the proposed scheme with an average quantum bit error rate of 1.60% and a standard deviation of 0.0583% for 16 h of continuous operation.

AB Variational Quantum Algorithms (VQA) are one of the most promising candidates for near-term quantum advantage. Traditionally, these algorithms are parameterized by rotational gate angles whose values are tuned over iterative execution on quantum machines. The iterative tuning of these gate angle parameters make VQAs more robust to a quantum machine's noise profile. However, the effect of noise is still a significant detriment to VQA's target estimations on real quantum machines - they are far from ideal. Thus, it is imperative to employ effective error mitigation strategies to improve the fidelity of these quantum algorithms on near-term machines.
   While existing error mitigation techniques built from theory do provide substantial gains, the disconnect between theory and real machine execution characteristics limit the scope of these improvements. Thus, it is critical to optimize mitigation techniques to explicitly suit the target application as well as the noise characteristics of the target machine.
   We propose VAQEM, which dynamically tailors existing error mitigation techniques to the actual, dynamic noisy execution characteristics of VQAs on a target quantum machine. We do so by tuning specific features of these mitigation techniques similar to the traditional rotation angle parameters by targeting improvements towards a specific objective function which represents the VQA problem at hand. In this paper, we target two types of error mitigation techniques which are suited to idle times in quantum circuits: single qubit gate scheduling and the insertion of dynamical decoupling sequences. We gain substantial improvements to VQA objective measurements a mean of over 3x across a variety of VQA applications, run on IBM Quantum machines.
   More importantly, while we study two specific error mitigation techniques, the proposed variational approach is general and can be extended to many other error mitigation techniques whose specific configurations are hard to select a priori. Integrating more mitigation techniques into the VAQEM framework in the future can lead to further formidable gains, potentially realizing practically useful VQA benefits on today's noisy quantum machines.

TI Classical-quantum dual encoding for laser communications in space
SO NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB In typical laser communications classical information is encoded by modulating the amplitude of the laser beam and measured via direct detection. We add a layer of security using quantum physics to this standard scheme, applicable to free-space channels. We consider a simultaneous classical-quantum communication scheme where the classical information is encoded in the usual way and the quantum information is encoded as fluctuations of a sub-Poissonian noise-floor. For secret key generation, we consider a continuous-variable quantum key distribution protocol (CVQKD) using a Gaussian ensemble of squeezed states and direct detection. Under the assumption of passive attacks secure key generation and classical communication can proceed simultaneously. Compared with standard CVQKD, which is secure against unrestricted attacks, our added layer of quantum security is simple to implement, robust and does not affect classical data rates. We perform detailed simulations of the performance of the protocol for a free-space atmospheric channel. We analyse security of the CVQKD protocol in the composable finite-size regime.

TI Advances in nano- and microscale NMR spectroscopy using diamond quantum
   sensors
SO CHEMICAL COMMUNICATIONS
AB Quantum technologies have seen a rapid developmental surge over the last couple of years. Though often overshadowed by quantum computation, quantum sensors show tremendous potential for widespread applications in chemistry and biology. One system stands out in particular: the nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center in diamond, an atomic-sized sensor allowing the detection of nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) signals at unprecedented length scales down to a single proton. In this article, we review the fundamentals of NV center-based quantum sensing and its distinct impact on nano- and microscale NMR spectroscopy. Furthermore, we highlight possible future applications of this novel technology ranging from energy research, materials science, to single-cell biology, and discuss the associated challenges of these rapidly developing NMR sensors.

TI A flexible framework for (n,n) quantum secret sharing
SO MODERN PHYSICS LETTERS A
AB With the rise of quantum computing, traditional cryptography is facing serious threats. Secret sharing, as an important primitive of cryptography, is also affected. Because secret sharing is widely used in many fields, researchers have started to explore quantum secret sharing (QSS). QSS uses basic principles of quantum mechanics to provide strong security and can protect against both eavesdropping and malicious attacks. However, most existing QSS studies focus on specific situations and lack the flexibility needed for complex multiparty environments. In this work, we propose a general QSS framework that can be applied to different scenarios. We first design a basic (n,n) QSS protocol, and then extend it to support multiparty communication and dynamic changes in participants. Our security analysis shows that the proposed method keeps strong security, uses fewer resources, and works independently without the need for a trusted third party (TP). This protocol offers a unified solution that can meet different application needs and provides a new approach to handling diverse QSS tasks more efficiently.

TI Dual epitaxial telecom spin-photon interfaces with long-lived coherence
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Optically active solid-state spin qubits thrive as an appealing technology for quantum interconnects and quantum networks, thanks to their atomic size, scalable synthesis, long-lived coherence, and ability to coherently interface with flying qubits. Trivalent erbium dopants, in particular, emerge as an attractive candidate due to their emission in the telecom C band and shielded 4f intra-shell spin and optical transitions. Nevertheless, prevailing top-down architectures for rare-earth qubits and devices have not yet achieved simultaneous long optical and spin coherence, which is necessary for efficient long-distance quantum networks. Here, we demonstrate dual Er3+ telecom spin-photon interfaces in two distinct lattice symmetry sites within an epitaxial thin-film platform. By leveraging high matrix crystallinity, controlled proximity of dopants to surfaces, and exploiting host lattice symmetry, we simultaneously achieve kilohertz-level optical linewidth in a strongly symmetry-protected site, and erbium qubit spin coherence times exceeding 10 milliseconds. Additionally, we realize single-shot readout and microwave coherent control of erbium qubits in a fiber-integrated package, enabling rapid deployment and scalability. These advancements highlight the significant potential of high-quality rare-earth qubits and quantum memories assembled using a bottom-up method, paving the way for scalable development of quantum light-matter interfaces tailored for telecommunication quantum networks.

TI An accordion superlattice for controlling atom separation in optical
   potentials
SO NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB We propose a method for separating trapped atoms in optical lattices by large distances. The key idea is the cyclic transfer of atoms between two lattices of variable spacing, known as accordion lattices, each covering at least a factor of two in lattice spacing. By coherently loading atoms between the two superimposed potentials, we can reach, in principle, arbitrarily large atom separations, while requiring only a relatively small numerical aperture. Numerical simulations of our 'accordion superlattice' show that the atoms remain localized to one lattice site throughout the separation process, even for moderate lattice depths. In a proof-of-principle experiment, we demonstrate the optical fields required for the accordion superlattice using acousto-optic deflectors. The method can be applied to neutral-atom quantum computing with optical tweezers, as well as quantum simulation of low-entropy many-body states. For instance, a unit-filling atomic Mott insulator can be coherently expanded by a factor of ten in order to load an optical tweezer array with very high filling. In turn, sorted tweezer arrays can be compressed to form high-density states of ultracold atoms in optical lattices. The method can also be applied to biological systems where dynamical separation of particles is required.

TI A Comparison of Three Ways to Measure Time-Dependent Densities With
   Quantum Simulators
SO FRONTIERS IN PHYSICS
AB Quantum algorithms are touted as a way around some classically intractable problems such as the simulation of quantum mechanics. At the end of all quantum algorithms is a quantum measurement whereby classical data is extracted and utilized. In fact, many of the modern hybrid-classical approaches are essentially quantum measurements of states with short quantum circuit descriptions. Here, we compare and examine three methods of extracting the time-dependent one-particle probability density from a quantum simulation: direct Z-measurement, Bayesian phase estimation, and harmonic inversion. We have tested these methods in the context of the potential inversion problem of time-dependent density functional theory. Our test results suggest that direct measurement is the preferable method. We also highlight areas where the other two methods may be useful and report on tests using Rigetti's quantum virtual device. This study provides a starting point for imminent applications of quantum computing.

TI Near-Video Frame Rate Quantum Sensing Using Hong-Ou-Mandel
   Interferometry
SO ADVANCED QUANTUM TECHNOLOGIES
AB Hong-Ou-Mandel (HOM) interference, bunching of two indistinguishable photons on a balanced beam-splitter, has emerged as a promising tool for quantum sensing. There is a need for wide spectral-bandwidth photon pairs (for high-resolution sensing) with high brightness (for fast sensing). Here, the generation of photon-pairs with flexible spectral-bandwidth even using single-frequency, continuous-wave diode laser enabling high-precision, real-time sensing is showed. Using 1-mm-long periodically-poled KTP crystal, degenerate, photon-pairs with spectral-bandwidth of 163.42 & PLUSMN;1.68 nm are produced resulting in a HOM-dip width of 4.01 & PLUSMN;0.04 & mu;$\umu$m to measure a displacement of 60 nm, and sufficiently high brightness to enable the measurement of vibrations with amplitude of 205 & PLUSMN; 0.75 nm and frequency of 8 Hz. Fisher-information (FI) and maximum likelihood estimation enables optical delay measurements as small as 4.97 nm with precision (Cramer-Rao bound) and accuracy of 0.89 and 0.54 nm, respectively, therefore showing HOM sensing capability for real-time, precision-augmented, in-field quantum sensing applications.

TI Effects of higher levels of qubits on control of qubit protected by a
   Josephson quantum filter
SO NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB A Josephson quantum filter (JQF) protects a data qubit (DQ) from the radiative decay into transmission lines (TLs) in superconducting quantum computing architectures. A transmon, which is a weakly nonlinear harmonic oscillator rather than a pure two-level system, can play a role of a JQF or a DQ. However, in the previous study, a JQF and a DQ were modeled as two-level systems neglecting the effects of higher levels. We theoretically examine the effects of the higher levels of the JQF and the DQ on the control of the DQ. It is shown that the higher levels of the DQ cause the shift of the resonance frequency and the decrease of the maximum population of the first excited state of the DQ in the controls with a continuous wave (cw) field and a pulsed field, while the higher levels of the JQF do not. Moreover, we present optimal parameters of the pulsed field, which maximize the control efficiency.

TI Ultrabright Entangled-Photon-Pair Generation from an AlGaAs-On-Insulator
   Microring Resonator
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB Entangled-photon pairs are an essential resource for quantum-information technologies. Chip-scale sources of entangled pairs have been integrated with various photonic platforms, including silicon, nitrides, indium phosphide, and lithium niobate, but each has fundamental limitations that restrict the photon-pair brightness and quality, including weak optical nonlinearity or high waveguide loss. Here, we demonstrate a novel ultralow-loss AlGaAs-on-insulator platform capable of generating time-energy entangled photons in a Q > 1 million microring resonator with nearly 1000-fold improvement in brightness compared to existing sources. The waveguide-integrated source exhibits an internal generation rate greater than 20 x 10(9) pairs s(-1) mW(-2), emits near 1550 nm, produces heralded single photons with > 99% purity, and violates Bell's inequality by more than 40 standard deviations with visibility > 97%. Combined with the high optical nonlinearity and optical gain of AlGaAs for active component integration, these are all essential features for a scalable quantum photonic platform.

TI Integration of Simulated Quantum Annealing in Parallel Tempering and
   Population Annealing for Heterogeneous-Profile QUBO Exploration
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB Simulated Quantum Annealing (SQA) is a heuristic algorithm which can solve Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) problems by emulating the exploration of the solution space done by a quantum annealer. It mimics the quantum superposition and tunnelling effects through a set of correlated replicas of the spins system representing the problem to be solved and performing Monte Carlo steps. However, the effectiveness of SQA over a classical algorithm strictly depends on the cost/energy profile of the target problem. In fact, quantum annealing only performs well in exploring functions with high and narrow peaks, while classical annealing is better in overcoming flat and wide energy-profile barriers. Unfortunately, real-world problems have a heterogeneous solution space and the probability of success of each solver depends on the size of the energy profile region compatible with its exploration mechanism. Therefore, significant advantages could be obtained by exploiting hybrid solvers, which combine SQA and classical algorithms. This work proposes four new quantum-classical algorithms: Simulated Quantum Parallel Tempering (SQPT), Simulated Quantum Population Annealing (SQPA), Simulated Quantum Parallel Tempering - Population Annealing v1 (SQPTPA1) and Simulated Quantum Parallel Tempering - Population Annealing v2 (SQPTPA2). They are obtained by combining SQA, Parallel Tempering (PT), and Population Annealing (PA). Their results are compared with those provided by SQA, considering benchmark QUBO problems, characterized by different profiles. Even though this work is preliminary, the obtained results are encouraging and prove hybrid solvers' potential in solving a generic optimization problem.

For this reason, the QTEdu pilot project 'Quantum Technology PCK for teachers' put together the expertise of several educational researchers in order to i) pre-research the Pedagogical Content Knowledge teachers need to teach Quantum Mechanics (QM) and Quantum Technology (QT) and ii) develop a PCK Map of practical use for teachers and teacher educators. The consortium performed pilots at the local level of existing teaching resources. The partners applied qualitative research methods such as interviews and observations in order to collect illustrations for the activities included in the developed PCK map.

TI Continuous variable multimode quantum states via symmetric group
   velocity matching
SO NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB Configurable and scalable continuous variable (CV) quantum networks for measurement-based quantum information protocols or multipartite quantum communication schemes can be obtained via parametric down conversion (PDC) in non-linear waveguides. In this work, we exploit symmetric group velocity matching (SGVM) to engineer the properties of the squeezed modes of the PDC. We identify type II PDC in a single waveguide as the best suited process, since multiple modes with non-negligible amount of squeezing can be obtained. We explore, for the first time, the waveguide dimensions, usually only set to ensure single-mode guiding, as an additional design parameter ensuring indistinguishability of the signal and idler fields. We investigate here potassium titanyl phosphate (KTP), which offers SGVM at telecommunications wavelengths, but our approach can be applied to any non-linear material and pump wavelength. This work paves the way toward the engineering of future large-scale quantum networks in the CV regime.

TI Optimal control of a quantum sensor: A fast algorithm based on an
   analytic solution
SO SCIPOST PHYSICS
AB Quantum sensors can show unprecedented sensitivities, provided they are controlled in a very specific, optimal way. Here, we consider a spin sensor of time-varying fields in the presence of dephasing noise, and we show that the problem of finding the pulsed control field that optimizes the sensitivity (i.e., the smallest detectable signal) can be mapped to the determination of the ground state of a spin chain. We find an approximate but analytic solution of this problem, which provides a lower bound for the sensitivity and a pulsed control very close to optimal, which we further use as initial guess for realizing a fast simulated annealing algorithm. We experimentally demonstrate the sensitivity improvement for a spin-qubit magnetometer based on a nitrogen-vacancy center in diamond.

SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Spin-active quantum emitters have emerged as a leading platform for quantum technologies. However, one of their major limitations is the large spread in optical emission frequencies, which typically extends over tens of GHz. Here, we investigate single V4+ vanadium centres in 4H-SiC, which feature telecom-wavelength emission and a coherent S = 1/2 spin state. We perform spectroscopy on single emitters and report the observation of spin-dependent optical transitions, a key requirement for spin-photon interfaces. By engineering the isotopic composition of the SiC matrix, we reduce the inhomogeneous spectral distribution of different emitters down to 100 MHz, significantly smaller than any other single quantum emitter. Additionally, we tailor the dopant concentration to stabilise the telecom-wavelength V4+ charge state, thereby extending its lifetime by at least two orders of magnitude. These results bolster the prospects for single V emitters in SiC as material nodes in scalable telecom quantum networks.
   Several solid-state defect platforms have been proposed for application as a spin-photon interface in quantum communication networks. Here the authors report spin-selective optical transitions and narrow inhomogeneous spectral distribution of V centers in isotopically-enriched SiC emitting in the telecom O-band.

TI Wavelength Selection for Satellite Quantum Key Distribution
SO APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL
AB Current distance limitations of quantum key distribution (QKD) over fibre optic networks suggest that satellite (free-space optical) QKD networks will be required to enable global quantum communications. However, the operational availability of these systems is limited by background noise and strong attenuation caused by turbulence and adverse weather conditions. Using the decoy-state BB84 QKD protocol, we evaluate the secret key rate for a range of wavelengths, receiver sizes and initial beam waists through a variety of atmospheric conditions. We combine filtering techniques, adaptive optics, and wavelength selection to optimize the performance of satellite QKD. This study is simulation-based.

TI Novel observables for exploring QCD collective evolution and quantum
   entanglement within individual jets
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW C
AB We postulate that nonperturbative quantum chromodynamics (QCD) effects occurring during parton fragmentation can result in collective effects of a multiparton system, reminiscent of those observed in high-energy hadronic or nuclear interactions with large final-state particle multiplicity. Proton-proton collisions at the CERN Large Hadron Collider showed surprising signatures of a strongly interacting, thermalized quark-gluon plasma, which was thought only to form in collisions of large nuclear systems. Another puzzle observed earlier in e+e- collisions is that production yields of various hadron species appear to follow a thermal-like distribution with a common temperature. We propose searches for thermal and collective properties resulting from parton fragmentation processes using high multiplicity jets in high-energy elementary collisions. Several novel observables are studied using the PYTHIA 8 Monte Carlo event generator. Experimental observation of such collectivity will offer a new view of nonperturbative QCD dynamics of multiparton systems at the smallest scales. Absence of any collective effects may offer new insights into the role of quantum entanglement in the observed thermal behavior of particle production in high energy collisions.

TI Emergence of noise-induced barren plateaus in arbitrary layered noise
   models
SO QUANTUM SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB In variational quantum algorithms the parameters of a parameterized quantum circuit are optimized in order to minimize a cost function that encodes the solution of the problem. The barren plateau phenomenon manifests as an exponentially vanishing dependence of the cost function with respect to the variational parameters, and thus hampers the optimization process. We discuss how, and in which sense, the phenomenon of noise-induced barren plateaus emerges in parameterized quantum circuits with a layered noise model. Previous results have shown the existence of noise-induced barren plateaus in the presence of local Pauli noise (Wang et al 2021 Nat. Commun. 12 6961). We extend these results analytically to arbitrary completely-positive trace preserving maps in two cases: (1) when a parameter-shift rule holds, (2) when the parameterized quantum circuit at each layer forms a unitary 2-design. The second example shows how highly expressive unitaries give rise not only to standard barren plateaus (McClean et al 2018 Nat. Commun. 9 4812), but also to noise-induced ones. In the second part of the paper, we study numerically the emergence of noise-induced barren plateaus in QAOA circuits focusing on the case of MaxCut problems on d-regular graphs and amplitude damping noise.

AB Quantum Computing is considered as the next frontier in computing, and it is attracting a lot of attention from the current scientific community. This kind of computation provides to researchers with a revolutionary paradigm for addressing complex optimization problems, offering a significant speed advantage and an efficient search ability. Anyway, Quantum Computing is still in an incipient stage of development. For this reason, present architectures show certain limitations, which have motivated the carrying out of this paper. In this paper, we introduce a novel solving scheme coined as hybrid Quantum Computing - Tabu Search Algorithm. Main pillars of operation of the proposed method are a greater control over the access to quantum resources, and a considerable reduction of non-profitable accesses. To assess the quality of our method, we have used 7 different Traveling Salesman Problem instances as benchmarking set. The obtained outcomes support the preliminary conclusion that our algorithm is an approach which offers promising results for solving partitioning problems while it drastically reduces the access to quantum computing resources. We also contribute to the field of Transfer Optimization by developing an evolutionary multiform multitasking algorithm as initialization method.

TI Numerical gate synthesis for quantum heuristics on bosonic quantum
   processors
SO FRONTIERS IN PHYSICS
AB There is a recent surge of interest and insights regarding the interplay of quantum optimal control and variational quantum algorithms. We study the framework in the context of qudits which are, for instance, definable as controllable electromagnetic modes of a superconducting cavity system coupled to a transmon. By employing recent quantum optimal control approaches described in (Petersson and Garcia, 2021), we showcase control of single-qudit operations up to eight states, and two-qutrit operations, mapped respectively onto a single mode and two modes of the resonator. We discuss the results of numerical pulse engineering on the closed system for parametrized gates useful to implement Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) for qudits. The results show that high fidelity ( > 0.99) is achievable with sufficient computational effort for most cases under study, and extensions to multiple modes and open, noisy systems are possible. The tailored pulses can be stored and used as calibrated primitives for a future compiler in circuit quantum electrodynamics (cQED) systems.

Simultaneous multiple noises are introduced as the kinetic energy term into the Schrodinger equation, which effectively reduces the probability of the algorithm falling into a local optimum by the parallel annealing process. The experimental results on the numerical optimisation problem and a real-world plug-in hybrid electric vehicles charging problem show that the proposed scheme is very competitive.

TI Independent state and measurement characterization for quantum computers
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Correctly characterizing state preparation and measurement (SPAM) processes is a necessary step towards building reliable quantum processing units (QPUs). In this work, we discuss the subtleties behind separately measuring SPAM errors. We propose a protocol that can separately estimate SPAM errors, in the case where quantum gates are ideal. In the case where the quantum gates are imperfect, we derive bounds on the estimated SPAM error rates, based on gate error measures, which can be estimated independently of SPAM processes. Our method shows that the gauge ambiguity in characterizing SPAM operations can be resolved by assuming that there exists one qubit whose initial state is uncorrelated with other qubits in a QPU. We test the protocol on a publicly available five-qubit QPU and demonstrate its validity by comparing our results with simulations.

TI Quantum Speed Limits Based on the Sharma-Mittal Entropy
SO ANNALEN DER PHYSIK
AB Quantum speed limits (QSLs) establish intrinsic bounds on the minimum time required for the evolution of quantum systems. We present a class of QSLs formulated in terms of the two-parameter Sharma-Mittal entropy (SME), applicable to finite-dimensional systems evolving under general nonunitary dynamics. In the single-qubit case, the QSLs for both quantum channels and non-Hermitian dynamics are analyzed in detail. For many-body systems, we explore the role of SME-based bounds in characterizing the reduced dynamics and apply the results to the XXZ spin chain model. These entropy-based QSLs characterize fundamental limits on quantum evolution speeds and may be employed in contexts including entropic uncertainty relations, quantum metrology, coherent control, and quantum sensing.

TI Time-Domain-Multiplexed Measurement-Based Quantum Operations with 25-MHz
   Clock Frequency
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW APPLIED
AB Continuous-variable optical quantum computation has seen much progress in recent years. In particular, cluster states-the universal resource for measurement-based quantum computation-have been realized in a scalable fashion using the time-domain multiplexing method. To utilize the cluster states in actual quantum computation, the measurement bases need to be programmed according to the desired computation. In addition, as the information is encoded in time in the time-domain multiplexing method, the measurement bases must be dynamically changed in time to fully utilize the large-scale cluster states. Here we report demonstrations of quantum operations using time-domain-multiplexed cluster states with a clock frequency of 25 MHz. This is achieved by our combining the cluster state-generation setup with the setup to change the measurement basis in the time domain. We also formulate a method to evaluate and verify continuous-variable operations where the quantum entanglements in the cluster states are utilized. Therefore, we demonstrate the implementation of quantum operations on scalable continuous-variable cluster-state architectures. The results in this work are compatible with the developing nonlinear feedforward and non-Gaussian state generation technology, which brings the realization of the large-scale fault-tolerant universal optical quantum computer closer to reality.

TI Mode-pairing quantum key distribution
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Quantum key distribution - the establishment of information-theoretically secure keys based on quantum physics - is mainly limited by its practical performance, which is characterised by the dependence of the key rate on the channel transmittance R(eta). Recently, schemes based on single-photon interference have been proposed to improve the key rate to R = O(root eta) by overcoming the point-to-point secret key capacity bound with interferometers. Unfortunately, all of these schemes require challenging global phase locking to realise a stable long-arm single-photon interferometer with a precision of approximately 100 nm over fibres that are hundreds of kilometres long. Aiming to address this problem, we propose a mode-pairing measurement-device-independent quantum key distribution scheme in which the encoded key bits and bases are determined during data post-processing. Using conventional second-order interference, this scheme can achieve a key rate of R = O(root eta) without global phase locking when the local phase fluctuation is mild. We expect this high-performance scheme to be ready-to-implement with off-the-shelf optical devices.

TI Reference-Frame-Independent Asynchronous Measurement-Device-Independent
   Quantum Key Distribution
SO ADVANCED QUANTUM TECHNOLOGIES
AB Asynchronous quantum key distribution protocol (AMDI-QKD) is a high performance quantum key distribution protocol while it can outperform the Pirandola-Laurenza-Ottaviani-Banchi (PLOB) bound without the need of phase-locking and phase-tracking techniques. However, the protocol applies the relative phase information of the communicating parties for encoding, and the drift of the reference frame inevitably affects the performance of the QKD system, whereas reference frame independent quantum key distribution (RFI-QKD) has the advantage of tolerating the slow change of the reference frame. In this study, a reference frame-independent asynchronous quantum key distribution (RFI-AMDI-QKD) scheme is proposed, which does not require phase alignment between the interferometers of both parties, and it is shown that the protocol can transmit over long distances and is robust to the drift of the reference frame.

TI Security of differential phase shift QKD from relativistic principles
SO QUANTUM
AB The design of quantum protocols for secure key generation poses many challenges: On the one hand, they need to be practical concerning experimental realisations. On the other hand, their theoretical description must be simple enough to allow for a security proof against all possible attacks. Often, these two requirements are in conflict with each other, and the differential phase shift (DPS) QKD protocol exemplifies these difficulties: It is designed to be implementable with current optical telecommunication technology, which, for this protocol, comes at the cost that many standard security proof techniques do not apply to it. After about 20 years since its invention, this work presents the first full security proof of DPS QKD against general attacks, including finite-size effects. The proof combines techniques from quantum information theory, quantum optics, and relativity. We first give a security proof of a QKD protocol whose security stems from relativistic constraints. We then show that security of DPS QKD can be reduced to security of the relativistic protocol. In addition, we show that coherent attacks on the DPS protocol are, in fact, stronger than collective attacks. Our results have broad implications for the development of secure and reliable quantum communication technologies, as they shed light on the range of applicability of stateof-the-art security proof techniques.

TI Kenfack - Zyczkowski indicator of nonclassicality for two non-equivalent
   representations of Wigner function of qutrit
SO PHYSICS LETTERS A
AB Following Kenfack and.Zyczkowski, we consider the indicator of nonclassicality of quantum states for N-level systems defined via the integral of the absolute value of the Wigner function. For these systems, remaining in the framework of Stratonovich-Weyl correspondence, one can construct a whole family of representations of the Wigner functions defined over the continuous phase-space and characterized by a set of (N-2) moduli parameters. It is shown that the nonclassicality indicator, being invariant under the SU(N) transformations of states, turns to be sensitive to the representation of the Wigner function. We analyse this representation dependence computing the Kenfack-. Zyczkowski indicators for pure and mixed states of a 3-level system using a generic and two degenerate Stratonovich-Weyl kernels respectively. Our calculations reveal three classes of states: the "absolutely classical/quantum" states, which have zero and non-vanishing indicator for all values of the moduli parameters correspondingly, and the "relatively quantum-classical" states whose classicality/quantumness is susceptible to a representation of the Wigner function. Herewith, all pure states of qutrit belong to the "absolutely quantum" states. (c) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

In recent years, with the growing applications of QKD in realistic channels such as satellite-based free-space communications, certain conditions such as the unlimited power collection ability of Eve become too strict for security analysis. Thus, in this invited paper, we give a brief overview of the quantum key distribution with a geometrical optics restricted power collection ability of Eve with its potential applications.

TI System characterization of dispersive readout in superconducting qubits
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW APPLIED
AB Designing quantum systems with the measurement speed and accuracy needed for quantum error correction using superconducting qubits requires iterative design and testing informed by accurate models and characterization tools. We introduce a single protocol, with few prerequisite calibrations, to measure the dispersive shift, resonator linewidth, and drive power used in the dispersive readout of superconducting qubits. We find that the resonator linewidth is poorly controlled, with a factor of 2 variation between the maximum and minimum measured values, and this variation is likely to require focused attention in future quantum error correction experiments. We also introduce a protocol for measuring the efficiency of the readout system using the same power levels as are used in typical qubit readout, and without the need to measure the qubit dephasing. We routinely run these protocols on chips with tens of qubits to a hundred qubits, driven by automation software with little human interaction. Using the extracted system parameters, we find that a model based on these parameters predicts the readout signal-to-noise ratio to within 10% over a device with 54 qubits.

TI Excited-state molecular dynamics simulation based on variational quantum
   algorithms
SO CHEMICAL PHYSICS LETTERS
AB We propose an excited-state molecular dynamics simulation method based on variational quantum algorithms at a computational cost comparable to that of ground-state simulations. We utilize the feature that excited -states can be obtained as metastable states in the restricted variational quantum eigensolver calculation with a hardware-efficient ansatz. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the method, molecular dynamics simulations are performed for the S1 excited-states of H2 and CH2NH molecules. The results are consistent with those of the exact adiabatic simulations in the S1 states, except for the CH2NH system, after crossing the conical intersection, where the proposed method causes a nonadiabatic transition.

TI Bennett-Brassard 1984 quantum key distribution using conjugate homodyne
   detection
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Optical homodyne detection has been widely used in continuous-variable (CV) quantum information processing for measuring field quadrature. In this paper we explore the possibility of operating a conjugate homodyne detection system in "photon counting" mode to implement discrete-variable (DV) quantum key distribution (QKD). A conjugate homodyne detection system, which consists of a beam splitter followed by two optical homodyne detectors, can simultaneously measure a pair of conjugate quadratures X and P of the incoming quantum state. In classical electrodynamics, X-2 + P-2 is proportional to the energy (the photon number) of the input light. In quantum optics, X and P do not commute and thus the above photon-number measurement is intrinsically noisy. This implies that a blind application of standard security proofs of QKD could result in pessimistic performance. We overcome this obstacle by taking advantage of two special features of the proposed detection scheme. First, the fundamental detection noise associated with vacuum fluctuations cannot be manipulated by an external adversary. Second, the ability to reconstruct the photon number distribution at the receiver's end can place additional constraints on possible attacks from the adversary. As an example, we study the security of the BB84 QKD using conjugate homodyne detection and evaluate its performance through numerical simulations. This study may open the door to a family of QKD protocols, complementary to the well-established DV-QKD based on single-photon detection and CV-QKD based on coherent detection.

TI Exploring the mechanisms of qubit representations and introducing a new
   category system for visual representations: results from expert ratings
SO EPJ QUANTUM TECHNOLOGY
AB In quantum physics (QP) education, the use of representations such as diagrams and visual aids that connect to mathematical concepts is crucial. Research in representation theory indicates that combining symbolic-mathematical elements (e.g., formulae) with visual-graphical representations enhances conceptual understanding more effectively than representations that merely depict phenomena. However, common representations vary widely, and existing category systems do not adequately distinguish between them in QP. To address this, we developed a new set of differentiation criteria based on insights from representation research, QP education, and specific aspects of the quantum sciences. We created a comprehensive category system for evaluating visual QP representations for educational use, grounded in Ainsworths (2006) DeFT Framework.Twenty-one experts from four countries evaluated this category system using four qubit representations: the Bloch sphere, Circle Notation, Quantum Bead, and the pie chart (Qake) model. This evaluation enabled us to assess the discriminative power of our criteria and to gain expert-based insights into the perceived effectiveness of each representation in supporting the learning of QP concepts. It evaluated how well each representation conveyed quantum concepts such as quantum state, measurement, superposition, entanglement, and quantum technologies (X-, Z-, and H-gates) across 16 criteria.The results showed significant differences in the effectiveness of these representations, particularly in conveying key concepts like superposition and measurement from an expert perspective. Additionally, expert ratings indicated notable variations in the potential of each representation to induce misconceptions, linked to differences in shape, measurement behaviour, and requirements for understanding entanglement. We also discuss considerations for developing new representations and suggest directions for future empirical studies.

TI Dissipative Dynamics of Graph-State Stabilizers with Superconducting
   Qubits
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB We study experimentally and numerically the noisy evolution of multipartite entangled states, focusing on superconducting qubit devices accessible via the cloud. We find that a valid modeling of the dynamics requires one to properly account for coherent frequency shifts, caused by stochastic charge -parity fluctuations. We introduce an approach modeling the charge -parity splitting using an extended Markovian environment. This approach is numerically scalable to tens of qubits, allowing us to simulate efficiently the dissipative dynamics of some large multiqubit states. Probing the continuous -time dynamics of increasingly larger and more complex initial states with up to 12 coupled qubits in a ring -graph state, we obtain a good agreement of the experiments and simulations. We show that the underlying many -body dynamics generate decays and revivals of stabilizers, which are used extensively in the context of quantum error correction. Furthermore, we demonstrate the mitigation of 2-qubit coherent interactions (crosstalk) using tailored dynamical decoupling sequences. Our noise model and the numerical approach can be valuable to advance the understanding of error correction and mitigation and invite further investigations of their dynamics.

TI Training Variational Quantum Circuits with CoVaR: Covariance Root
   Finding with Classical Shadows
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW X
AB Exploiting near-term quantum computers and achieving practical value is a considerable and exciting challenge. Most prominent candidates as variational algorithms typically aim to find the ground state of a Hamiltonian by minimizing a single classical (energy) surface which is sampled from by a quantum computer. Here, we introduce a method we call CoVaR, an alternative means to exploit the power of variational circuits: We find eigenstates by finding joint roots of a polynomially growing number of properties of the quantum state as covariance functions between the Hamiltonian and an operator pool of our choice. The most remarkable feature of our CoVaR approach is that it allows us to fully exploit the extremely powerful classical shadow techniques; i.e., we simultaneously estimate a very large number > 104-107 of covariances. We randomly select covariances and estimate analytical derivatives at each iteration applying a stochastic Levenberg-Marquardt step via a large but tractable linear system of equations that we solve with a classical computer. We prove that the cost in quantum resources per iteration is comparable to a standard gradient estimation; however, we observe in numerical simulations a very significant improvement by many orders of magnitude in convergence speed. CoVaR is directly analogous to stochastic gradient-based optimizations of paramount importance to classical machine learning while we also offload significant but tractable work onto the classical processor. As we demonstrate numerically, the approach shares features with phase-estimation protocols that prepare eigenstates with a dominant initial fidelity contribution.

TI Quantum Direct-Sequence Spread-Spectrum CDMA Communication Systems:
   Mathematical Foundations
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON QUANTUM ENGINEERING
AB This article describes the fundamental principles and mathematical foundations of quantum direct-sequence spread-spectrum code division multiple-access communication systems. The evolution of quantum signals through the quantum direct-sequence spread-spectrum multiple-access communication system is carefully characterized by a novel approach called the decomposition of creation operators. In this methodology, the creation operator of the transmitted quantum signal is decomposed into the chip-time interval creation operators, each of which is defined over the duration of a chip. These chip-time interval creation operators are the invariant building blocks of the spread-spectrum quantum communication systems. With the aid of the proposed chip-time decomposition approach, we can find closed-form relations for quantum signals at the receiver of such a quantum communication system. Furthermore, this article details the principles of narrowband filtering of quantum signals required at the receiver, a crucial step in designing and analyzing quantum communication systems. We show, that by employing coherent states as the transmitted quantum signals, the interuser interference appears as an additive term in the magnitude of the output coherent (Glauber) state, and the output of the quantum communication system is a pure quantum signal. On the other hand, if the transmitters utilize particle-like quantum signals (Fock states) such as single-photon states, the entanglement effect can arise at the receivers. The important techniques developed in this article are expected to have far-reaching implications for various applications in the exciting field of quantum communications and quantum signal processing.

TI Quantum simulation of a three-mode optomechanical system based on the
   Fredkin-type interaction
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB The realization of multimode optomechanical interactions in the single-photon strong-coupling regime is a desired task in cavity optomechanics, but it remains a big challenge in realistic physical systems. In this work we propose a reliable scheme to simulate a three-mode optomechanical system working in the single-photon strongcoupling regime based on the Fredkin-type interaction. This is achieved by utilizing two strong drivings to the two exchange-coupled modes in the Fredkin-type coupling involving one optical mode and two mechanical-like modes. As an application of this enhanced three-mode nonlinear optomechanical coupling, we show how to generate entangled cat states of the mechanical-like modes using the conditional displacement mechanism. The quantum coherence effects in the generated states are investigated by calculating the two-mode joint Wigner function and quantum entanglement. The influence of the system dissipation on the state generation is also considered. This work will open up a different route to the study of multimode optomechanical interactions at the single-photon level.

TI A Case for Synthesis of Recursive Quantum Unitary Programs
SO PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACM ON PROGRAMMING LANGUAGES-PACMPL
AB Quantum programs are notoriously difficult to code and verify due to unintuitive quantum knowledge associated with quantum programming. Automated tools relieving the tedium and errors associated with low-level quantum details would hence be highly desirable. In this paper, we initiate the study of program synthesis for quantum unitary programs that recursively define a family of unitary circuits for different input sizes, which are widely used in existing quantum programming languages. Specifically, we present QSynth, the first quantum program synthesis framework, including a new inductive quantum programming language, its specification, a sound logic for reasoning, and an encoding of the reasoning procedure into SMT instances. By leveraging existing SMT solvers, QSynth successfully synthesizes 10 quantum unitary programs including quantum arithmetic programs, quantum eigenvalue inversion, quantum teleportation and Quantum Fourier Transformation, which can be readily transpiled to executable programs on major quantum platforms, e.g., Q#, IBM Qiskit, and AWS Braket.

TI Magnetic devil's staircaselike behavior in quasiperiodic qubit lattices
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
AB The devil's staircase (DS) phenomenon is a fractal response of magnetization to external fields, traditionally observed in periodic ferromagnetic systems, where the commensurability between spin arrangements, lattice parameters, and external magnetic fields governs abrupt changes in magnetization. Its occurrence in aperiodic, fractal-type systems has remained largely unexplored, despite their natural compatibility with such phenomena. Using a quantum annealing device, we uncover a wealth of abrupt magnetic transitions between spin manifolds driven by increasing external magnetic fields within a simple yet effective Ising-model framework. In contrast to periodic systems, where DS arises from long-range competing interactions, our findings reveal that short-range, purely antiferromagnetic couplings in aperiodic geometries produce equally rich ground-state magnetization patterns. We demonstrate that while magnetic textures are determined by the lattice size, their formation remains remarkably robust and independent of scale, with commensurability emerging locally. Our results challenge the prevailing view that DS behavior is limited to periodic systems and establish quasiperiodic geometries as a natural host for this phenomenon.

TI On-chip generation and dynamic piezo-optomechanical rotation of single
   photons
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Hybrid quantum technologies synergistically combine different types of systems with complementary strengths. Here, the authors show monolithic integration and control of quantum dots and the emitted single photons in a surface acoustic wave-driven GaAs integrated quantum photonic circuit.
   Integrated photonic circuits are key components for photonic quantum technologies and for the implementation of chip-based quantum devices. Future applications demand flexible architectures to overcome common limitations of many current devices, for instance the lack of tuneabilty or built-in quantum light sources. Here, we report on a dynamically reconfigurable integrated photonic circuit comprising integrated quantum dots (QDs), a Mach-Zehnder interferometer (MZI) and surface acoustic wave (SAW) transducers directly fabricated on a monolithic semiconductor platform. We demonstrate on-chip single photon generation by the QD and its sub-nanosecond dynamic on-chip control. Two independently applied SAWs piezo-optomechanically rotate the single photon in the MZI or spectrally modulate the QD emission wavelength. In the MZI, SAWs imprint a time-dependent optical phase and modulate the qubit rotation to the output superposition state. This enables dynamic single photon routing with frequencies exceeding one gigahertz. Finally, the combination of the dynamic single photon control and spectral tuning of the QD realizes wavelength multiplexing of the input photon state and demultiplexing it at the output. Our approach is scalable to multi-component integrated quantum photonic circuits and is compatible with hybrid photonic architectures and other key components for instance photonic resonators or on-chip detectors.

TI Quantum imaging of the reconfigurable VO2 synaptic

SO SCIENCE ADVANCES
AB Neuromorphic computing has shown remarkable capabilities in silicon-based artificial intelligence, which can be optimized by using Mott materials for functional synaptic connections. However, the research efforts focus on two-terminal artificial synapses and envisioned the networks controlled by silicon-based circuits, which is difficult to develop and integrate. Here, we propose a dynamic network with laser-controlled conducting filaments based on electric field-induced local insulator-metal transition of vanadium dioxide. Quantum sensing is used to realize conductivity-sensitive imaging of conducting filament. We find that the location of filament formation is manipulated by focused laser, which is applicable to simulate the dynamical synaptic connections between the neurons. The ability to process signals with both long-term and short-term potentiation is further demonstrated with similar to 60 times on/off ratio while switching the pathways. This study opens the door to the development of dynamic network structures depending on easily controlled conduction pathways, mimicking the biological nervous systems.

TI Deterministic generation of indistinguishable photons in a cluster state
SO NATURE PHOTONICS
AB Entanglement between particles is a basic concept of quantum sciences. The ability to produce entangled particles in a controllable manner is essential for any quantum technology. Entanglement between light particles (photons) is particularly crucial for quantum communication due to light's non-interactive nature and long-lasting coherence. Resources producing entangled multiphoton cluster states will enable communication between remote quantum nodes, as the inbuilt redundancy of cluster photons allows for repeated local measurements-compensating for losses and probabilistic Bell measurements. For feasible applications, the cluster generation should be fast, deterministic and, most importantly, its photons indistinguishable, which will allow measurements and fusion of clusters by interfering photons. Here, using periodic excitation of a semiconductor quantum-dot-confined spin, we demonstrate a multi-indistinguishable photon cluster, featuring a continuously generated string of photons at deterministic gigahertz generation rates, and an optimized entanglement length of about ten photons. The indistinguishability of the photons opens up new possibilities for scaling up the cluster's dimensionality by fusion, thus building graph states suited for measurement-based photonic quantum computers and all-photonic quantum repeaters.
   A continuous string of indistinguishable photons entangled in a cluster state is generated on demand from an InAs/GaAs quantum dot. The confined heavy-hole spin is used as an entangler. Under an externally tuned magnetic field, an optimized characteristic entanglement decay length of about ten photons is obtained.

TI Optimal Protocols in Quantum Annealing and Quantum Approximate
   Optimization Algorithm Problems
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB Quantum annealing (QA) and the quantum approximate optimization algorithm (QAOA) are two special cases of the following control problem: apply a combination of two Hamiltonians to minimize the energy of a quantum state. Which is more effective has remained unclear. Here we analytically apply the framework of optimal control theory to show that generically, given a fixed amount of time, the optimal procedure has the pulsed (or "bang-bang") structure of QAOA at the beginning and end but can have a smooth annealing structure in between. This is in contrast to previous works which have suggested that bang-bang (i.e., QAOA) protocols are ideal. To support this theoretical work, we carry out simulations of various transverse field Ising models, demonstrating that bang-anneal-bang protocols are more common. The general features identified here provide guideposts for the nascent experimental implementations of quantum optimization algorithms.

TI Feynman Meets Turing: The Uncomputability of Quantum Gate-Circuit
   Emulation and Concatenation
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON COMPUTERS
AB We investigate the feasibility of computing quantum gate-circuit emulation (QGCE) and quantum gate-circuit concatenation (QGCC) on digital hardware. QGCE serves the purpose of rewriting gate circuits comprised of gates from a varying input gate set to gate circuits formed of gates from a fixed target gate set. Analogously, QGCC serves the purpose of finding an approximation to the concatenation of two arbitrary elements of a varying list of input gate circuits in terms of another element from the same list. Problems of this kind occur regularly in quantum computing and are often assumed an easy task for the digital computers controlling the quantum hardware. Arguably, this belief is due to analogical reasoning: The classical Boolean equivalents of QGCE and QGCC are natively computable on digital hardware. In the present paper, we present two insights in this regard: Upon applying a rigorous theory of computability, QGCE and QGCC turn out to be uncomputable on digital hardware. The results remain valid when we restrict the set of feasible inputs for the relevant functions to one parameter families of fixed gate sets. Our results underline the possibility that several ideas from quantum-computing theory may require a rethinking to become feasible for practical implementation.

TI One T Gate Makes Distribution Learning Hard
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB The task of learning a probability distribution from samples is ubiquitous across the natural sciences. The output distributions of local quantum circuits are of central importance in both quantum advantage proposals and a variety of quantum machine learning algorithms. In this work, we extensively characterize the learnability of output distributions of local quantum circuits. Firstly, we contrast learnability with simulatability by showing that Clifford circuit output distributions are efficiently learnable, while the injection of a single T gate renders the density modeling task hard for any depth d 1/4 n & omega;o1 thorn . We further show that the task of generative modeling universal quantum circuits at any depth d 1/4 n & omega;o1 thorn is hard for any learning algorithm, classical or quantum, and that for statistical query algorithms, even depth d 1/4 & omega;1/2logon thorn ⠂ Clifford circuits are hard to learn. Our results show that one cannot use the output distributions of local quantum circuits to provide a separation between the power of quantum and classical generative modeling algorithms, and therefore provide evidence against quantum advantages for practically relevant probabilistic modeling tasks.

TI Effective spin models of Kerr-nonlinear parametric oscillators for
   quantum annealing
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB A method of quantum annealing (QA) using Kerr-nonlinear parametric oscillators (KPOs) was proposed. This method is described by bosonic operators and has different characteristics from QA based on the transverse-field Ising model. As the first step to describe this method in the conventional framework of QA, we propose effective spin models of KPOs. The spin models are obtained via a variant of the Holstein-Primakoff transformation and are described by spin-s operators. The terms for detuning, coherent driving, parametric driving, and the Kerr effect are mapped to the transverse field, longitudinal field, and nonlinear terms for the z and x components of spins, respectively. By analyzing the spin models corresponding to KPOs in several settings, we demonstrate that the present spin models for a rather large s and tuned parameters qualitatively reproduce the behavior of KPOs.

TI Quantum simulation of interacting fermions
SO ACTA PHYSICA SINICA
AB Fermions are basic building blocks in the standard model. Interactions among these elementary particles determine how they assemble and consequently form various states of matter in our nature. Simulating fermionic degrees of freedom is also a central problem in condensed matter physics and quantum chemistry, which is crucial to understanding high-temperature superconductivity, quantum magnetism and molecular structure and functionality. However, simulating interacting fermions by classical computing generically face the minus sign problem, encountering the exponential computation complexity. Ultracold atoms provide an ideal experimental platform for quantum simulation of interacting fermions. This highly-controllable system enables the realizing of nontrivial fermionic models, by which the physical properties of the models can be obtained by measurements in experiment. This deepens our understanding of related physical mechanisms and helps determine the key parameters. In recent years, there have been versatile experimental studies on quantum ground state physics, finite temperature thermal equilibrium, and quantum many-body dynamics, in fermionic quantum simulation systems. Quantum simulation offers an access to the physical problems that are intractable on the classical computer, including studying macroscopic quantum phenomena and microscopic physical mechanisms, which demonstrates the quantum advantages of controllable quantum systems. This paper briefly introduces the model of interacting fermions describing the quantum states of matter in such a system. Then we discuss various states of matter, which can arise in interacting fermionic quantum systems, including Cooper pair superfluids and density-wave orders. These exotic quantum states play important roles in describing hightemperature superconductivity and quantum magnetism, but their simulations on the classical computers have exponentially computational cost. Related researches on quantum simulation of interacting fermions in determining the phase diagrams and equation of states reflect the quantum advantage of such systems.

TI Observation of interaction induced blockade and local spin freezing in a
   NMR quantum simulator
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB We experimentally emulate interaction induced blockade and local spin freezing in two and three qubit NMR architecture. These phenomena are identical to the Rydberg blockade and Rydberg biased freezing. In Rydberg blockade, the simultaneous excitation of two or more atoms is blocked due to the level shift induced by the strong van der Waal's interaction. In such a strong interaction regime, one can also observe Rydberg biased freezing, wherein the dynamics is confined to a subspace, with the help of multiple drives with unequal amplitudes. Here we drive NMR qubits with specific transition-selective radio waves, while intermittently characterizing the quantum states via quantum state tomography. This not only allows us to track the population dynamics, but also helps to probe quantum correlations, by means of quantum discord, evolving under blockade and freezing phenomena. Our work constitutes experimental simulations of these phenomena in the NMR platform. Moreover, these studies open up interesting quantum control perspectives in exploiting the above phenomena for entanglement generation as well as subspace manipulations.

TI Entanglement induced by Heisenberg exchange between an electron in a
   nested quantum dot and a qubit with relative motion
SO NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB We propose a nested quantum dot (QD) structure to achieve enhanced control of entanglementinduced by Heisenberg exchange between an electron and a qubit. Entanglement is quantified bymutual information (MI). We first consider the case of permanent exchange with the qubitembedded in a QD and find that the maximum MI (among all times) is solely determined by theinitial angle between the spins. The entanglement exhibits distinct growth characteristics duringdifferent phases, and the saturation behavior mimics that of a strict zero-dimensional QD, whereexchangestrengthandinteractiontimecombineintoasingleparameter,theamountofinteraction.Introducing a nested dot with a moving qubit (decaying exchange) allows the electron to occupyeither bound or scattering states, resulting in different final entanglement. In longitudinal motion,scattering states produce greater entanglement, while in transverse motion, the exchange range andqubit speed govern the entanglement behavior. The nested QD structure offers broad tunability ofthe final entanglement through gate voltage control, although the maximum achievable MIremains fundamentally limited by the maximum set in the case of permanent exchange. Ourresults demonstrate that combining system geometry, motion speed, and voltage control providesan effective strategy for optimizing entanglement tunability in QD devices

TI Measuring Concurrence in Qubit Werner States Without an Aligned
   Reference Frame
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW APPLIED
AB The genuine concurrence is a standard quantifier of multipartite entanglement, detection, and quantification of which still remains a difficult problem from both the theoretical and experimental points of view. Although many efforts have been devoted to the detection of multipartite entanglement (e.g., using entanglement witnesses), measuring the degree of multipartite entanglement, in general, requires some knowledge about the exact shape of a density matrix of the quantum state. An experimental reconstruction of such a density matrix can be done by full state tomography, which amounts to having the distant parties share a common reference frame and well-calibrated devices. Although this assumption is typically made implicitly in theoretical works, establishing a common reference frame, as well as aligning and calibrating measurement devices in experimental situations, are never trivial tasks. It is therefore an interesting and important question whether the requirements of having a shared reference frame and calibrated devices can be relaxed. In this work, we study both theoretically and experimentally the genuine concurrence for the generalized Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger states under randomly chosen measurements on individual qubits without a shared frame of reference and calibrated devices. We present the relation between genuine concurrence and the so-called nonlocal volume, a recently introduced indicator of nonlocality.

TI Minimizing readout-induced noise for early fault-tolerant quantum
   computers
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Quantum error correcting code can diagnose potential errors and correct them based on measured outcomes by leveraging syndrome measurement. However, mid -circuit measurement has been technically challenging for early fault -tolerant quantum computers and the readout -induced noise acts as a main contributor to the logical infidelity. We present a different method for syndrome extraction, namely generalized syndrome measurement , that requires only a single -shot measurement on a single ancilla, while the canonical syndrome measurement requires multiple measurements to extract the eigenvalue for each stabilizer generator. As such, we can detect the error in the logical state with minimized readout -induced noise. By adopting our method as a precheck routine for quantum error correcting cycles, we can significantly reduce the readout overhead, the idling time, and the logical error rate during syndrome measurement. We numerically analyze the performance of our protocol using Iceberg code and Steane code under realistic noise parameters based on superconducting hardware and demonstrate the advantage of our protocol in the near -term scenario. As mid -circuit measurements are still error -prone for near -term quantum hardware, our method could boost the applications of early fault -tolerant quantum computing.

TI On Incorrectness Logic for Quantum Programs
SO PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACM ON PROGRAMMING LANGUAGES-PACMPL
AB Bug-catching is important for developing quantum programs. Motivated by the incorrectness logic for classical programs, we propose an incorrectness logic towards a logical foundation for static bug-catching in quantum programming. The validity of formulas in this logic is dual to that of quantum Hoare logics. We justify the formulation of validity by an intuitive explanation from a reachability point of view and a comparison against several alternative formulations. Compared with existing works focusing on dynamic analysis, our logic provides sound and complete arguments. We further demonstrate the usefulness of the logic by reasoning several examples, including Grover's search, quantum teleportation, and a repeat-until-success program. We also automate the reasoning procedure by a prototyped static analyzer built on top of the logic rules.

TI Quantum annealing-based route optimization for commercial AGV operating
   systems in large-scale logistics warehouses
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB This study proposes a new approach to optimizing the routing of Automated Guided Vehicles (AGVs) in large-scale logistics warehouses using Quantum Annealing. As logistics operations grow, efficient AGV routing becomes critical for ensuring safety, reliability, and throughput, particularly in high-density environments. To address the complexity of real-world systems, we introduce an enhanced cost function that incorporates a real-time priority factor to improve both routing performance and operation safety. In this paper, we present a secure and computationally efficient candidate route generation method, along with an Optimization Problem Clustering technique that decomposes the large problem into smaller, tractable subproblems to reduce computational complexity. The proposed methods are designed to incorporate real-time operational data to ensure collision avoidance, maintain safe operations, and enhance routing efficiency in realistic large-scale warehouse environments. We validate the proposed methods using a state-of-the-art Quantum Annealing machine, benchmarking against both classical and quantum-inspired solvers. Integration with a commercial AGV Operating System (AOS) is demonstrated, enabling seamless connectivity with classical solvers via a local network and with Quantum Annealing and Quantum-inspired solvers via cloud infrastructure. Simulations involving 1000 AGVs show that the proposed route generation method reduces the number of optimization variables by an average of 96% for small-scale to medium-scale systems and 78% for large-scale systems, while also improving route quality. The clustering method reduces the maximum problem size to under 10,000 variables, enabling scalable and safe control of large AGV fleets. Furthermore, a complexity-based problem formulation reduces sampling time by approximately 28.2% compared to conventional size-based approaches for problems ranging from 1000 to 10,000 variables. These results demonstrate the practical viability of Quantum Annealing for managing large-scale AGV Operating Systems and underscore the potential of the proposed methods for advancing logistics optimization in real-world warehouse environments.

TI Hierarchical Quantum Architecture Search for Variational Quantum
   Algorithms
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON QUANTUM ENGINEERING
AB Designing efficient variational quantum algorithms (VQAs) is crucial for transforming the theoretical advantages of quantum algorithms into practical applications. In this context, quantum architecture search (QAS) has been introduced to automate the search and design of VQAs. However, current mainstream QAS algorithms typically perform both global and local searches simultaneously, which can result in high search space complexity and optimization challenges. In this paper, we propose a hierarchical quantum architecture search framework based on a two-stage search structure. In the first stage, global exploration of the overall quantum circuit structure is performed, while in the second stage, local optimization of quantum gate selection is carried out. We provide a numerical analysis of the theoretical advantages of the proposed framework in reducing the search space. To evaluate practical performance, we conduct experiments on quantum chemistry tasks with different algorithm combinations integrated into the framework. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of the hierarchical search structure in automating quantum circuit design.

TI Hybrid Quantum-Classical Deep Neural Networks Based Smart Contract
   Vulnerability Detection
SO APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL
AB The increasing adoption of blockchain technology has presented significant challenges in maintaining the security and reliability of smart contracts. This study addresses the problem of identifying security flaws in smart contracts, which may result in monetary damages and diminished confidence in blockchain systems. A Hybrid Quantum-Classical Deep Neural Network (HQCDNN) approach was proposed, combining quantum computing principles with classical deep learning methods to identify various vulnerability types, including access control, arithmetic, front-running, reentrancy, time manipulation, denial of service, and unchecked low calls. The SmartBugs Wild Dataset was used for training, with TF-IDF employed as a preprocessing technique optimized for hybrid architectures. Experiments were conducted using hybrid architectures with 2-qubit and 4-qubit quantum layers, alongside a classical deep neural network (DNN) model for comparative analysis. The HQCDNN model attained accuracy levels ranging from 96.4% to 78.2% and F1-scores between 96.6% and 80.2%, showcasing enhanced performance compared to the classical and deep learning models referenced in the literature. These results highlight the capability of HQCDNNs to improve the identification of security flaws in smart contracts. Future work could focus on evaluating the model on actual quantum devices and expanding its application to larger datasets for further validation.

TI Dissipative preparation of qutrit entanglement via periodically
   modulated Rydberg double antiblockade
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB We propose a mechanism of Rydberg double antiblockade by virtue of a resonant dipole-dipole interaction between a pair of Rydberg atoms placed at short distances scaling as 1/R-3. By combining this novel excitation regime with microwave-driven fields and dissipative dynamics, a stationary qutrit entangled state can be obtained with high quality, the corresponding steady-state fidelity and purity are insensitive to the variations of the dynamical parameters. Furthermore, we introduce time-dependent laser fields with periodically modulated amplitude to speed up the entanglement creation process. Numerical simulations reveal that the order of magnitude of the shortened convergence time is about 10(3) in units of omega(0), and the acceleration effect appears valid in broad parametric space. The present results enrich the physics of the Rydberg antiblockade regimes and may receive more attention for the experimental investigations in dissipative dynamics of neutral atoms.

TI A thin film lithium niobate near-infrared platform for multiplexing
   quantum nodes
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Practical quantum networks will require multi-qubit quantum nodes. This in turn will increase the complexity of the photonic circuits needed to control each qubit and require strategies to multiplex memories. Integrated photonics operating at visible to near-infrared (VNIR) wavelength range can provide solutions to these needs. In this work, we realize a VNIR thin-film lithium niobate (TFLN) integrated photonics platform with the key components to meet these requirements, including low-loss couplers (<1 dB/facet), switches (>20 dB extinction), and high-bandwidth electro-optic modulators (>50 GHz). With these devices, we demonstrate high-efficiency and CW-compatible frequency shifting (>50% efficiency at 15 GHz), as well as simultaneous laser amplitude and frequency control. Finally, we highlight an architecture for multiplexing quantum memories and outline how this platform can enable a 2-order of magnitude improvement in entanglement rates over single memory nodes. Our results demonstrate that TFLN can meet the necessary performance and scalability benchmarks to enable large-scale quantum nodes.

SO NUCLEAR PHYSICS B
AB Quantum computers are emerging technologies expected to become important tools for exploring various aspects of fundamental physics in the future. Therefore, we pose the question of whether quantum computers can help us to study the Page curve and the black hole information dynamics, which has been a key focus in fundamental physics. In this regard, we rigorously examine the qubit transport model, a toy qubit model of black hole evaporation on IBM's superconducting quantum computers, to shed light on this question. Specifically, we implement the quantum simulation of the scrambling dynamics in black holes using an efficient random unitary circuit. Furthermore, we employ the swap-based many-body interference protocol and the randomized measurement protocol to measure the entanglement entropy of Hawking radiation qubits in this model. Finally, by incorporating quantum error mitigation techniques into our challenging implementation of entanglement entropy measurement protocols on the IBM quantum hardware, we accurately determine the R & eacute;nyi entropy in the qubit transport model, thus showcasing the utility of quantum computers for future investigations of complex quantum systems.

AB Due to the significant progress made in the implementation of quantum hardware, efficient methods and tools to design corresponding algorithms become increasingly important. Many of these tools rely on functional representations of certain building blocks or even entire quantum algorithms which, however, inherently exhibit an exponential complexity. Although several alternative representations have been proposed to cope with this complexity, the construction of those representations remains a bottleneck. In this work, we propose solutions for efficiently constructing representations of quantum functionality based on the idea of conducting as many operations as possible on as small as possible intermediate representations-using Decision Diagrams as a representative functional description. Experimental evaluations show that applying these solutions allows to construct the desired representations several factors faster than with state-of-the-art methods. Moreover, if repeating structures (which frequently occur in quantum algorithms) are explicitly exploited, exponential improvements are possible-allowing to construct the functionality of certain algorithms within seconds, whereas the state of the art fails to construct it in an entire day.

TI Extendibility limits quantum-secured communication and key distillation
SO REPORTS ON PROGRESS IN PHYSICS
AB Secret-key distillation from quantum states and channels is a central task of interest in quantum information theory, as it facilitates private communication over a quantum network. Here, we study the task of secret-key distillation from bipartite states and point-to-point quantum channels using local operations and one-way classical communication (one-way LOCC). We employ the resource theory of unextendible entanglement to study the transformation of a bipartite state under one-way LOCC, and we obtain several efficiently computable upper bounds on the number of secret bits that can be distilled from a bipartite state using one-way LOCC channels; these findings apply not only in the one-shot setting but also in some restricted asymptotic settings. We extend our formalism to private communication over a quantum channel assisted by forward classical communication. We obtain efficiently computable upper bounds on the one-shot forward-assisted private capacity of a channel, thus addressing a question in the theory of quantum-secured communication that has been open for some time now. Our formalism also provides upper bounds on the rate of private communication when using a large number of channels in such a way that the error in the transmitted private data decreases exponentially with the number of channel uses. Moreover, our bounds can be computed using semidefinite programs, thus providing a computationally feasible method to understand the limits of private communication over a quantum network.

TI Reducing measurement costs by recycling the Hessian in adaptive
   variational quantum algorithms
SO QUANTUM SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB Adaptive protocols enable the construction of more efficient state preparation circuits in variational quantum algorithms (VQAs) by utilizing data obtained from the quantum processor during the execution of the algorithm. This idea originated with Adaptive Derivative-Assembled Problem-Tailored variational quantum eigensolver (ADAPT-VQE), an algorithm that iteratively grows the state preparation circuit operator by operator, with each new operator accompanied by a new variational parameter, and where all parameters acquired thus far are optimized in each iteration. In ADAPT-VQE and other adaptive VQAs that followed it, it has been shown that initializing parameters to their optimal values from the previous iteration speeds up convergence and avoids shallow local traps in the parameter landscape. However, no other data from the optimization performed at one iteration is carried over to the next. In this work, we propose an improved quasi-Newton optimization protocol specifically tailored to adaptive VQAs. The distinctive feature in our proposal is that approximate second derivatives of the cost function are recycled across iterations in addition to optimal parameter values. We implement a quasi-Newton optimizer where an approximation to the inverse Hessian matrix is continuously built and grown across the iterations of an adaptive VQA. The resulting algorithm has the flavor of a continuous optimization where the dimension of the search space is augmented when the gradient norm falls below a given threshold. We show that this inter-optimization exchange of second-order information leads the approximate Hessian in the state of the optimizer to be consistently closer to the exact Hessian. As a result, our method achieves a superlinear convergence rate even in situations where the typical implementation of a quasi-Newton optimizer converges only linearly. Our protocol decreases the measurement costs in implementing adaptive VQAs on quantum hardware as well as the runtime of their classical simulation.

SO BULLETIN OF THE AMERICAN METEOROLOGICAL SOCIETY
AB Over the past few years, quantum computers and quantum algorithms have attracted considerable interest and attention from numerous scientific disciplines. In this article, we aim to provide a nontechnical yet informative introduction to key aspects of quantum computing. We discuss whether quantum computers one day might become useful tools for numerical weather and climate prediction. Using a recently developed quantum algorithm for solving nonlinear differential equations, we integrate a simple nonlinear model. In addition to considering the advantages that quantum computers have to offer, we shall also discuss the challenges one faces when trying to use quantum computers for real-world problems involving "big data," such as weather prediction.

Today many companies like IBM, Google and Microsoft have developed quantum computers and simulators for research and commercial use. The development of quantum techniques and algorithms is essential to exploit the full power of quantum computers.

TI Toward a Mølmer Sørensen gate with .9999 fidelity
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICS B-ATOMIC MOLECULAR AND OPTICAL PHYSICS
AB Realistic fault-tolerant quantum computing at reasonable overhead requires two-qubit gates with the highest possible fidelity. Typically, an infidelity of less than or similar to 10(-4) is recommended in the literature. Focusing on the phase-sensitive architecture used in laboratories and by commercial companies to implement quantum computers, we show that even under noise-free, ideal conditions, neglecting the carrier term and linearizing the Lamb-Dicke term in the Hamiltonian used for control-pulse construction for generating M & oslash;lmer-S & oslash;rensen XX gates based on the Raman scheme are not justified if the goal is an infidelity target of <10(-4). We obtain these results with a gate simulator code that, in addition to the computational space, explicitly takes the most relevant part of the phonon space into account. With the help of a Magnus expansion carried to the third order, keeping terms up to the fourth order in the Lamb-Dicke parameters, we identify the leading sources of coherent errors, which we show can be eliminated by adding a single linear equation to the phase-space closure conditions and subsequently adjusting the amplitude of the control pulse (calibration). This way, we obtain XX gates with infidelities <10(-4).

TI A Method Based on Timing Weight Priority and Distance Optimization for
   Quantum Circuit Transformation
SO ENTROPY
AB In order to implement a quantum circuit on an NISQ device, it must be transformed into a functionally equivalent circuit that satisfies the device's connectivity constraints. However, NISQ devices are inherently noisy, and minimizing the number of SWAP gates added to the circuit is crucial for reducing computation errors. To achieve this, we propose a subgraph isomorphism algorithm based on the timing weight priority of quantum gates, which provides a better initial mapping for a specific two-dimensional quantum architecture. Additionally, we introduce a heuristic swap sequence selection optimization algorithm that uses a distance optimization measurement function to select the ideal sequence and reduce the number of SWAP gates, thereby optimizing the circuit transformation. Our experiments demonstrate that our proposed algorithm is effective for most benchmark quantum circuits, with a maximum optimization rate of up to 43.51% and an average optimization rate of 13.51%, outperforming existing related methods.

TI Efficient Construction of Feasible Solutions in Column Generation Using
   Quantum Annealing
SO JOURNAL OF THE PHYSICAL SOCIETY OF JAPAN
AB Column generation (CG) has been used to solve constrained 0-1 quadratic programming problems. The pricing problem, which is iteratively solved in CG, can be reduced to an unconstrained 0-1 quadratic programming problem, allowing for the efficient application of quantum annealing (QA). The solutions obtained by CG are continuous relaxations, which cannot be practically used as feasible 0-1 solutions. In this paper, we propose a postprocessing method for constructing feasible 0-1 solutions from the continuous relaxations obtained through CG. The proposed technique consists of two phases: (i) mapping the continuous CG solution to a feasible 0-1 solution and (ii) applying a constraint-aware local search to improve that solution's quality. Numerical experiments on randomly generated problems demonstrate that CG with the proposed postprocessing yields solutions comparable to commercial solvers with significantly reduced computation time. Consequently, the postprocessing enables CG with QA to obtain high-quality approximate solutions faster.

TI The impact of spot-size on single-photon avalanche diode timing-jitter
   and quantum key distribution
SO IET QUANTUM COMMUNICATION
AB In free-space implementations of Quantum key distribution (QKD), the wide adoption of near-Infrared wavelengths has led to the common use of silicon single-photon avalanche diodes (Si-SPAD) for receiver systems. While the impacts of some SPAD properties on QKD have been explored extensively, the relationship of spot-size and spatial position on the full instrumental response and thus quantum bit error rate (QBER) has been studied little. Changes in spot size and spatial position can result from atmospheric turbulence and pointing and tracking errors. Here, An empirical analysis of that relationship is presented utilising a large active area, 500 mu m, free-space coupled Si-SPAD designed for free-space QKD. A baseline full-width at half-maximum timing jitter of 182 ps and a QBER contribution of 0.1 % for a 1 GHz clock frequency QKD system and 100 ps time-gating window are reported. The impacts of spot-size and spatial position can increase the QBER to over 0.3%. The link between the spot-size and timing jitter will allow the understanding of tolerancing for the alignment of Si-SPADs within free-space QKD receiver systems-an important factor in designing properly engineered practical systems and the equipment needed to compensate for atmospheric turbulence and pointing and tracking.
   For quantum key distribution (QKD), single-photon avalanche diodes (SPAD) are limited by the full timing response. Here, the impact of spot diameter and spatial position of the multimode fibre on a SPAD timing response is summarised. image

TI Quarta: quantum supervised and unsupervised learning for binary
   classification in domain-incremental learning
SO QUANTUM MACHINE INTELLIGENCE
AB Quantum machine learning recently gained prominence due to the promise of quantum computers in solving machine learning problems that are intractable on a classical computer. Nevertheless, several studies on problems which remain challenging for classical computing algorithms are emerging. One of these is classifying continuously incoming data instances in incremental fashion, which is studied in this paper through a hybrid computational solution that combines classical and quantum techniques. Hybrid approaches represents one of the current ways for the use of quantum computation in practical applications. In this paper, we show how typical issues of domain-incremental learning can be equally addressed with the properties of quantum mechanics, until to offer often better results. We propose the framework QUARTA to combine algorithms of quantum supervised learning, that is, variational quantum circuits, and techniques used in quantum unsupervised learning, that is, distance estimation. We aim at keeping the classification capabilities, which have learned on previously processed data instances, preserved as much as possible, and then acquiring new knowledge on new data instances. Experiments are performed on real-world datasets with quantum simulators.

TI Emergent geometry from quantum probability
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW D
AB Carrying the insights of conditional probability to the quantum realm is notoriously difficult due to the noncommutative nature of quantum observables. Nevertheless, conditional expectations on von Neumann algebras have played a significant role in the development of quantum information theory, and especially the study of quantum error correction. In quantum gravity, it has been suggested that conditional expectations may be used to implement the holographic map algebraically, with quantum error correction underlying the emergence of spacetime through the generalized entropy formula. However, the requirements for exact error correction are almost certainly too strong for realistic theories of quantum gravity. In this paper, we present a relaxed notion of quantum conditional expectation which implements approximate error correction. We introduce a generalization of Connes's spatial theory adapted to completely positive maps, and derive a chain rule allowing for the noncommutative factorization of relative modular operators into a marginal and conditional part, constituting a quantum Bayes's law. This allows for an exact quantification of the information gap occurring in the data processing inequality for arbitrary quantum channels. When applied to algebraic inclusions, this also provides an approach to factorizing the entropy of states into a sum of terms which, in the gravitational context, may be interpreted as a generalized entropy. We illustrate that the emergent area operator is fully noncommutative rather than central, except under the conditions of exact error correction. We provide some comments on how this result may be used to construct a fully algebraic quantum extremal surface prescription and to probe the quantum nature of black holes.

TI Few-photon storage on a second timescale by electromagnetically induced
   transparency in a doped solid
SO NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB We present the experimental demonstration of light storage towards the single photon level at a long storage time by electromagnetically induced transparency in a rare-earth ion-doped Pr3+:Y2SiO5 crystal. We apply decoherence control by static magnetic fields and appropriately designed radio-frequency composite pulse sequences to prolong the storage time in the memory. A rare-earth ion-doped filter crystal prepared by optical pumping serves to efficiently separate the signal at the single photon level from optical noise. Multipass setups around the memory and the filter crystal improve the storage efficiency and filter selectivity. Already without decoherence control, the setup permits storage of single photons in the microsecond regime at a storage efficiency of 42%. With decoherence control we demonstrate storage of weak coherent pulses containing some 10 photons for up to 10 s at a storage efficiency of several percent. The experimental data clearly demonstrate the applicability of EIT light storage to implement a true quantum memory in Pr3+:Y2SiO5 at long storage times. The scientific findings and technical developments are of relevance also to other protocols and media for quantum information storage.

TI Estimating Gibbs partition function with quantum Clifford sampling
SO QUANTUM SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB The partition function is an essential quantity in statistical mechanics, and its accurate computation is a key component of any statistical analysis of quantum systems and phenomena. However, for interacting many-body quantum systems, its calculation generally involves summing over an exponential number of terms and can thus quickly grow to be intractable. Accurately and efficiently estimating the partition function of its corresponding system Hamiltonian then becomes the key in solving quantum many-body problems. In this paper we develop a hybrid quantum-classical algorithm to estimate the partition function, utilising a novel quantum Clifford sampling technique. Note that previous works on the estimation of partition functions require O(1/epsilon root Delta)-depth quantum circuits (Srinivasan et al 2021 IEEE Int. Conf. on Quantum Computing and Engineering (QCE) pp 112-22; Montanaro 2015 Proc. R. Soc. A 471 20150301), where Delta is the minimum spectral gap of stochastic matrices and epsilon is the multiplicative error. Our algorithm requires only a shallow O(1)-depth quantum circuit, repeated O(n/epsilon(2)) times, to provide a comparable epsilon approximation. Shallow-depth quantum circuits are considered vitally important for currently available noisy intermediate-scale quantum devices.

TI Cryptochrome and quantum biology: unraveling the mysteries of plant
   magnetoreception
SO FRONTIERS IN PLANT SCIENCE
AB Magnetoreception, the remarkable ability of organisms to perceive and respond to Earth's magnetic field, has captivated scientists for decades, particularly within the field of quantum biology. In the plant science, the exploration of the complicated interplay between quantum phenomena and classical biology in the context of plant magnetoreception has emerged as an attractive area of research. This comprehensive review investigates into three prominent theoretical models: the Radical Pair Mechanism (RPM), the Level Crossing Mechanism (LCM), and the Magnetite-based MagR theory in plants. While examining the advantages, limitations, and challenges associated with each model, this review places a particular weight on the RPM, highlighting its well-established role of cryptochromes and in-vivo experiments on light-independent plant magnetoreception. However, alternative mechanisms such as the LCM and the MagR theory are objectively presented as convincing perspectives that permit further investigation. To shed light on these theoretical frameworks, this review proposes experimental approaches including cutting-edge experimental techniques. By integrating these approaches, a comprehensive understanding of the complex mechanisms driving plant magnetoreception can be achieved, lending support to the fundamental principle in the RPM. In conclusion, this review provides a panoramic overview of plant magnetoreception, highlighting the exciting potential of quantum biology in unraveling the mysteries of magnetoreception. As researchers embark on this captivating scientific journey, the doors to deciphering the diverse mechanisms of magnetoreception in plants stand wide open, offering a profound exploration of nature's adaptations to environmental cues.

TI An Enhanced Virtualized Control and Key Management Model for QKD

SO IEEE NETWORK
AB The advent of softwarization and disaggregated architectures has transformed modern communication networks, sparking innovation by separating network functionalities from the underlying hardware. Following this trend, in future quantum networks, the virtualization and softwarization of critical components will be essential to achieve global interoperability and enhance adaptability. Virtualization allows for the abstraction of hardware resources, making it easier to manage and scale networks dynamically, while softwarization promotes flexibility, reconfigurability, and interoperability by enabling the use of standardized, software-defined protocols that can be easily updated and modified to work across diverse and evolving network environments. In this paper, we introduce and examine an operational model for QKD networks that leverages the virtualization of control and key management functionalities. We detail its elements and procedures to optimize QKD services. The design paves the way for the integration of quantum network with functions already established in modern mobile networks while adhering to established QKD network standards. The proposed operational model has been validated at the 5G Telefonica Open Network Innovation Centre (5TONIC) using an environment that deploys digital twins of QKD networks.

TI QuantMark: A Benchmarking API for VQE Algorithms
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON QUANTUM ENGINEERING
AB Thanks to the rise of quantum computers, many variations of the variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) have been proposed in recent times. This is a promising development for real quantum algorithms, as the VQE is a promising algorithm that runs on current quantum hardware. However, the popular method of comparing your algorithm versus a classical baseline in a small basis set is not meaningful in the big picture. Moreover, many papers use a different molecular representation or a different quantum computer to test their algorithms such that the used baselines are different between different papers. Thus, it is almost impossible to compare the different algorithms to each other. As a solution, we have built a benchmarking framework to standardize the VQE performance metrics, such that they can be analyzed more easily. Using our framework, any researcher working on the VQE can easily test their own algorithms against previous ones on the leaderboard without the need to reproduce previous work themselves.

TI A Novel Efficient Quantum Random Access Memory
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB Owing to the significant progress in manufacturing desktop quantum computers, the quest to achieve efficient quantum random access memory (QRAM) became inevitable. In this paper, we propose a novel efficient random access memory for quantum computers. The proposed QRAM has a fixed structure and can be used efficiently to store both known and unknown classical/quantum data. The storage capacity of the proposed QRAM is more efficient than that of the classical RAMs and can be used to store both classical and quantum information. Furthermore, the proposed model can access an arbitrary location in O(1) compared with other state-of-the-art models.

TI Quantum information flow in impurity qubits interacting with Bose-Bose
   mixtures
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB We investigate the dynamics of quantum information flow in one and two impurity qubits trapped in a double-well potential and interacting with a one-dimensional ultracold Bose-Bose mixture reservoir. For a single qubit immersed in a binary Bose mixture, we show that the system maintains coherence over finite timescales and exhibits non-Markovian dynamics, particularly in the upper branch of the environment. We explore the transition from Markovian to non-Markovian dephasing through the Ohmicity of the spectral density functions, which are significantly influenced by interspecies interactions. In the case of two spatially separated qubits coupled to the Bose-Bose mixture reservoir, we demonstrate that collective decoherence affects the system dynamics, leading to prolonged coherence survival in both branches of the mixture. The intricate evolution of the decoherence factors is reflected in the density spectral functions and their Ohmicity characteristics. We find that the decoherence functions and spectra oscillate with increasing distance between the qubits, modifying the information flow dynamics. Additionally, we conduct a thorough investigation of the entanglement dynamics between the two qubits induced by the binary Bose mixture reservoir in both branches, underscoring the critical role of interspecies interactions.

TI Bell Nonlocality and EPR Steering Decay in Dephasing Hyperfine Spins
SO AXIOMS
AB This work presents a comprehensive study of quantum correlations and their degradation under environmental dephasing within the atomic hydrogen system. By analyzing the magnetic coupling between the electron and proton spins in the 1s hyperfine state, we elucidate how coherent spin interactions generate entangled states and govern their temporal evolution. The investigation focuses on three key measures of quantum correlations-Bell nonlocality, Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR) steering, and quantum purity-each reflecting a different level within the hierarchy of nonclassical correlations. Analytical formulations and numerical simulations reveal that, in the absence of decay, all quantities remain steady, indicating the preservation of coherence. When dephasing is introduced, each measure decays exponentially toward a stationary lower bound, with Bell nonlocality identified as the most fragile, followed by steering and purity. A three-dimensional analysis of Werner states under dephasing further establishes the critical purity thresholds required for Bell inequality violations. The results highlight the interdependence between magnetic coupling, decoherence, and initial entanglement, providing a unified framework for understanding correlation dynamics in open quantum systems. These findings have direct implications for the development of noise-resilient quantum information protocols and spin-based quantum technologies, where preserving nonlocal correlations is essential for reliable quantum operations.

TI Certifying position-momentum entanglement at telecommunication
   wavelengths
SO PHYSICA SCRIPTA
AB The successful employment of high-dimensional quantum correlations and its integration in telecommunication infrastructures is vital in cutting-edge quantum technologies for increasing robustness and key generation rate. Position-momentum Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR) entanglement of photon pairs are a promising resource of such high-dimensional quantum correlations. Here, we experimentally certify EPR correlations of photon pairs generated by spontaneous parametric down-conversion (SPDC) in a nonlinear crystal with type-0 phase-matching at telecommunication wavelength for the first time. To experimentally observe EPR entanglement, we perform scanning measurements in the near- and far-field planes of the signal and idler modes. We certify EPR correlations with high statistical significance of up to 45 standard deviations. Furthermore, we determine the entanglement of formation of our source to be greater than one, indicating a dimensionality of greater than 2. Operating at telecommunication wavelengths around 1550 nm, our source is compatible with today's deployed telecommunication infrastructure, thus paving the way for integrating sources of high-dimensional entanglement into quantum-communication infrastructures.

TI Conditional-NOT Displacement: Fast Multioscillator Control with a Single
   Qubit
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW X
AB Bosonic encoding is an approach for quantum information processing, promising lower hardware overhead by encoding in the many levels of a harmonic-oscillator mode. Scaling to multiple modes requires weak interaction for independent control, yet strong interaction for fast control. Applying fast and efficient universal control on multiple modes remains an open problem. Surprisingly, we find that displacements conditioned on the state of a single-qubit ancilla coupled to multiple harmonic oscillators are sufficient for universal control. We present the conditional-NO operation concept, which can be used to reduce the duration of entangling gates. Within this guiding concept, we develop the conditional-NOT displacement control method which enables fast generation and control of bosonic states in multimode systems weakly coupled to a single-ancilla qubit. Our method is fast despite the weak ancilla coupling. The weak coupling in turn allows for excellent separability and thus independent control. We demonstrate our control on a superconducting transmon qubit weakly coupled to a multimode superconducting cavity. We create both entangled and separable cat states in different modes of the multimode cavity, showing entangling operations at low crosstalk while maintaining independent control of the different modes. We show that the operation time is not limited by the inverse of the coupling rate, which is the typical timescale, and we exceed it by almost 2 orders of magnitude. We verify our results with an efficient method for measurement of the multimode characteristic function which employs our conditional-NOT displacement. Our results inspire a new approach toward general entangling operations and allow for fast and efficient multimode bosonic encoding and measurement.

AB Quantum electrodynamics (QED) predicts that photons from positronium decay are maximally entangled. However, experimental verification of this entanglement in high-energy photons has remained elusive due to competing decay processes and interactions with the surrounding medium. The J-PET detector is a multi-modules detector based on plastic scintillators that has the potential to measure such correlation in the whole phase space. Photons interact with plastic mainly via Compton scattering, which makes J-PET particularly suitable for this type of study. Moreover, by incorporating the positron lifetime as an additional parameter, to differentiate between various decay processes and examine how the polarization correlation changes as a function of lifetime. Such studies provide new insights into quantum entanglement at high energy regimes and hold potential to enhance positron emission tomography (PET) imaging techniques. Recent results demonstrate the J-PET detector's capability to measure the polarization correlation of photons emitted from positron annihilation in a porous medium. In this paper, we present a review of past research in this field, highlighting the need for further investigation of polarization correlation of annihilation photons.

Furthermore, quantum key recovery attacks are also presented for natural generalizations of SoEM. For some variants of SoEM, they found that their quantum attacks are not obvious and left it as an open problem to discuss the security of such constructions. This paper focuses on this open problem and presents a positive response. We provide quantum key recovery attacks against such constructions by quantum algorithms. For natural generalizations of SoEM with linear key schedules, we also present similar quantum key recovery attacks by quantum algorithms (Simon's algorithm, Grover's algorithm, and Grover-meet-Simon algorithm).

TI Certifying the classical simulation cost of a quantum channel
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB A fundamental objective in quantum information science is to determine the cost in classical resources of simulating a particular quantum system. The classical simulation cost is quantified by the signaling dimension which specifies the minimum amount of classical communication needed to perfectly simulate a channel's input-output correlations when unlimited shared randomness is held between encoder and decoder. This paper provides a collection of device-independent tests that place lower and upper bounds on the signaling dimension of a channel. Among them, a single family of tests is shown to determine when a noisy classical channel can be simulated using an amount of communication strictly less than either its input or its output alphabet size. In addition, a family of eight signaling dimension witnesses is presented that completely characterize when any four-outcome measurement channel, such as a Bell measurement, can be simulated using one communication bit and shared randomness. Finally, we bound the signaling dimension for all partial replacer channels in d dimensions. The bounds are found to be tight for the special case of the erasure channel.

TI Robust control and optimal Rydberg states for neutral atom two-qubit
   gates
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB We investigate the robustness of two-qubit gates to deviations of experimental controls on a neutral atom platform utilizing Rydberg states. We construct robust controlled-Z gates-employing techniques from quantum optimal control-that retain high Bell-state fidelity F > 0.999 in the presence of significant deviations of the coupling strength to the Rydberg state. Such deviations can arise from laser intensity noise and atomic motion in an inhomogeneous coupling field. We also discuss methods to mitigate errors due to deviations of the laser detuning. The designed pulses operate on timescales that are short compared to the fundamental decay timescale set by spontaneous emission and blackbody radiation. We account for the finite lifetime of the Rydberg state in both the optimization and fidelity calculations-this makes the gates conducive to noisy intermediate-scale quantum experiments, meaning that our protocols can reduce infidelity on near-term quantum computing devices. We calculate physical properties associated with infidelity for strontium-88 atoms-including lifetimes, polarizabilities, and blockade strengths-and use these calculations to identify optimal Rydberg states for our protocols, which allows for further minimization of infidelity.

TI Open quantum system violates generalized Pauli constraints on quantum
   device
SO COMMUNICATIONS PHYSICS
AB Fermionic systems in a pure state are subject to restrictions on the natural orbital occupation, known as the generalized Pauli constraints. The authors probe the violation of such constraints in 3-to-7 qubit systems, experimentally demonstrating that the one-fermion reduced density matrix encodes the openness of a fermionic quantum system.
   The Pauli exclusion principle governs the fundamental structure and function of fermionic systems from molecules to materials. Nonetheless, when such a fermionic system is in a pure state, it is subject to additional restrictions known as the generalized Pauli constraints (GPCs). Here we verify experimentally the violation of the GPCs for an open quantum system using data from a superconducting-qubit quantum computer. We prepare states of systems with three-to-seven qubits directly on the quantum device and measure the one-fermion reduced density matrix (1-RDM) from which we can test the GPCs. We find that the GPCs of the 1-RDM are sufficiently sensitive to detect the openness of the 3-to-7 qubit systems in the presence of a single-qubit environment. Results confirm experimentally that the openness of a many-fermion quantum system can be decoded from only a knowledge of the 1-RDM with potential applications from quantum computing and sensing to noise-assisted energy transfer.

TI Quantum optimization for multi-target Active Debris Removal missions
SO EPJ QUANTUM TECHNOLOGY
AB The rapid accumulation of space debris in Low Earth Orbit (LEO) poses a significant challenge to the sustainability of space operations. While preventive measures limit new debris generation, they are insufficient to mitigate the growing population of defunct satellites, rocket stages, and collision fragments. Active Debris Removal (ADR) has emerged as a viable solution, which requires solving NP-hard combinatorial optimization problem similar to the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) to maximize mission efficiency by minimizing fuel and mission duration. This work explores the application of Quantum Annealing (QA) and Hybrid Quantum Annealing (HQA) for optimizing multi-target ADR missions. Specifically, it introduces a Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) model for ADR, exploiting quantum computing to enhance solution efficiency. A novel quadratization method is developed to reduce computational complexity, enabling large-scale mission planning. Additionally, a novel constraint-handling strategy is proposed, integrating mission constraints into post-processing to enhance quantum solver efficiency. The proposed approach is validated using real-world satellite debris datasets and benchmarked against classical metaheuristic optimizers, including Simulated Annealing (SA), Tabu Search (TS), and Genetic Algorithms (GA). The obtained results demonstrate the advantages of quantum optimization for ADR mission planning, providing a scalable and computationally efficient solution.

The method explores the efficiently classically simulable Clifford points of a parameterized quantum circuit, using simulated annealing to find a low-energy initial state. We provide numerical evidence of the effectiveness of the technique for different choices of the Hamiltonian structure, number of qubits, and circuit depth. While a number of problems are considered, we note that the method is particularly useful for quantum chemistry problems, for which it is able to capture long-range correlation energy. The presented method could help achieve a quantum advantage in noisy or fault-tolerant intermediate-scale devices by preparing a high-quality initial state.

TI Experimental Deep Reinforcement Learning for Error-Robust Gate-Set
   Design on a Superconducting Quantum Computer
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB Quantum computers promise tremendous impact across applications-and have shown great strides in hardware engineering-but remain notoriously error prone. Careful design of low-level controls has been shown to compensate for the processes that induce hardware errors, leveraging techniques from optimal and robust control. However, these techniques rely heavily on the availability of highly accurate and detailed physical models, which generally achieve only sufficient representative fidelity for the most simple operations and generic noise modes. In this work, we use deep reinforcement learning to design a universal set of error-robust quantum logic gates in runtime on a superconducting quantum computer, without requiring knowledge of a specific Hamiltonian model of the system, its controls, or its underlying error processes. We experimentally demonstrate that a fully autonomous deep-reinforcement-learning agent can design single qubit gates up to 3x faster than default DRAG operations without additional leakage error, and exhibiting robustness against calibration drifts over weeks. We then show that ZX (-pi/2) operations implemented using the cross-resonance interaction can outperform hardware default gates by over 2x and equivalently exhibit superior calibration-free performance up to 25 days post optimization. We benchmark the performance of deep-reinforcement-learning-derived gates against other black-box optimization techniques, showing that deep reinforcement learning can achieve comparable or marginally superior performance, even with limited hardware access.

TI Comparative Study of Variations in Quantum Approximate Optimization
   Algorithms for the Traveling Salesman Problem
SO ENTROPY
AB The traveling salesman problem (TSP) is one of the most often-used NP-hard problems in computer science to study the effectiveness of computing models and hardware platforms. In this regard, it is also heavily used as a vehicle to study the feasibility of the quantum computing paradigm for this class of problems. In this paper, we tackle the TSP using the quantum approximate optimization algorithm (QAOA) approach by formulating it as an optimization problem. By adopting an improved qubit encoding strategy and a layer-wise learning optimization protocol, we present numerical results obtained from the gate-based digital quantum simulator, specifically targeting TSP instances with 3, 4, and 5 cities. We focus on the evaluations of three distinctive QAOA mixer designs, considering their performances in terms of numerical accuracy and optimization cost. Notably, we find that a well-balanced QAOA mixer design exhibits more promising potential for gate-based simulators and realistic quantum devices in the long run, an observation further supported by our noise model simulations. Furthermore, we investigate the sensitivity of the simulations to the TSP graph. Overall, our simulation results show that the digital quantum simulation of problem-inspired ansatz is a successful candidate for finding optimal TSP solutions.

TI Triggering single-molecule qubit spin dynamics via non-Abelian
   geometric phase effects
SO PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY CHEMICAL PHYSICS
AB We illustrate how macroscopic rotations can be utilised to trigger and control a spin dynamics within the ground doublet of both Kramers and non-Kramers-type molecular nanomagnets via the non-Abelian character of the time-evolution operator. For Kramers magnets, we show how this effect can be harnessed to realise single-qubit quantum gates and give the explicit example of a recently reported CoCl2(tu)(4) single-molecule magnet (SMM). We demonstrate that gating operations could be performed on this magnet in as fast as 10 ps before the breakdown of adiabaticity, much faster than typical spin-lattice relaxation times. Based on this effect, we also suggest CoCl2(tu)(4) as a quantum gyroscope for sensing yaw-axis rotations. For integer spin nanomagnets where non-axial crystal field interactions often lift ground state degeneracy, we show how spin dynamics from the non-Abelian geometric propagator can be recovered using non-adiabatic macroscopic rotations not-necessarily resonant with the tunnel splitting gap. Using the well-known TbPc2 single-ion magnet as a further example, we identify an experimentally plausible non-adiabatic rotation that induces a coherent superposition of tunnelling ground states, tantamount to preparing each member of a TbPc2 ensemble in the maximal angular momentum state |mJ = 6. The detection of an ensuing coherent oscillation of the macroscopic magnetisation polarised along the TbPc2 principal magnetic axis after the completed rotation could then proceed via time-resolved magnetisation measurements.

TI Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger states: Their identifications and robust
   violations
SO MODERN PHYSICS LETTERS A
AB The N-qubit Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) states are the maximally entangled states of N qubits, which have had many important applications in quantum information processing, such as quantum key distribution and quantum secret sharing. Thus how to distinguish the GHZ states from other quantum states becomes a significant problem. In this work, by presenting a family of the generalized Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt (CHSH) inequality, we show that the N-qubit GHZ states can be indeed identified by the maximal violations of the generalized CHSH inequality under some specific measurement settings. The generalized CHSH inequality is simple and contains only four correlation functions for any N-qubit system, thus has the merit of facilitating experimental verification. Furthermore, we present a quantum phenomenon of robust violations of the generalized CHSH inequality in which the maximal violation of Bell's inequality can be robust under some specific noises adding to the N-qubit GHZ states.

TI Exploring semiconductor qubits: simulation of a four quantum dot silicon
   device
SO QUANTUM SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB Quantum computing represents a revolutionary computational paradigm with the potential to overcome the limitations of classical computers. Among the various approaches under investigation, semiconductor-based solutions stand out as promising candidates for qubit implementation. This work explores a four-quantum dot SiGe heterostructure. The above structure has been analyzed using the low-level finite element method-based simulator quantum technology computer-aided design (QTCAD) to derive essential physical parameters critical for implementing electron spin qubits. Even though QTCAD may not be as accurate as real experiments, it nonetheless provides important insights into the device behavior. The aim is to use these simulations to effectively analyze the device's response to changes in structural parameters and determine whether it is feasible for real-world applications. As a result, changes to the structure can be made by simply modifying the simulation code, avoiding the need for repetitive and expensive lithographic processes. Notably, this is the first time a four-quantum-dot system has been analyzed using QTCAD. Specifically, the study involves solving the non-linear Poisson equation as well as single and multi particle Schr & ouml;dinger equations. Additionally, a transport analysis is performed, yielding Coulomb peaks, Coulomb diamonds, and charge stability diagrams. Finally, an approximation of the tunneling coefficient and the exchange interaction energy between the different dot pairs is computed. The results provide a foundation for the design of advanced logic circuits able to execute multiple quantum logic gates. By leveraging the precise control over quantum dot configuration, it becomes possible to customize the interactions between quantum states for specific computational purposes. This approach enables the realization of complex architectures where individual quantum dots act as qubits or nodes in a quantum network. The ability to tune gate voltages and control inter-dot couplings allows for the implementation of complex quantum logic gates.

TI Quantum simulation of the bosonic Kitaev chain
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Superconducting quantum circuits are a natural platform for quantum simulations of a wide variety of important lattice models describing topological phenomena, spanning condensed matter and high-energy physics. One such model is the bosonic analog of the well-known fermionic Kitaev chain, a 1D tight-binding model with both nearest-neighbor hopping and pairing terms. Despite being fully Hermitian, the bosonic Kitaev chain exhibits a number of striking features associated with non-Hermitian systems, including chiral transport and a dramatic sensitivity to boundary conditions known as the non-Hermitian skin effect. Here, using a multimode superconducting parametric cavity, we implement the bosonic Kitaev chain in synthetic dimensions. The lattice sites are mapped to frequency modes of the cavity, and the in situ tunable complex hopping and pairing terms are created by parametric pumping at the mode-difference and mode-sum frequencies, respectively. We experimentally demonstrate important precursors of nontrivial topology and the non-Hermitian skin effect in the bosonic Kitaev chain, including chiral transport, quadrature wavefunction localization, and sensitivity to boundary conditions. Our experiment is an important first step towards exploring genuine many-body non-Hermitian quantum dynamics.
   Interesting non-Hermitian quantum dynamics can be accessed in analogue quantum simulators consisting of Hermitian bosonic systems with squeezing and antisqueezing terms. Here, the authors use a coplanar waveguide resonator connected to a SQUID to simulate the bosonic version of the Kitaev chain.

TI Modern finance through quantum computing-A systematic literature review
SO PLOS ONE
AB Human intellectual restlessness originates from the need for knowledge of the modern world. The financial world is struggling to prototype accurate and fast data at low risk. The quantum approach to finance can support this desire. The goal of this paper is to provide a comprehensive review of the literature on how quantum computing can be used in finance. This research aims to expose an architecture of the state of the art in quantum finance. In terms of methodology, the PSALSAR framework was used to conduct this systematic literature review. The selection procedure followed the PRISMA guidelines and was applied in two databases (Web of Science and Scopus) without time limit. In total, 94 out of 1646 articles were included for data extraction and assessment of content evaluation covering the period 2001-2023. The current review of quantum finance literature is structured around the following themes: journals, research methods, tested data series, research topics in quantum finance, and future research directions. Within the financial sector, quantum computing is used in three main areas: simulation, optimization, and machine learning. These areas are supported by algorithms that have been created in recent years. Finally, we propose to highlight the benefits and the applications of quantum finance and to stimulate the interest in the future prospects of the debates.

TI PrivShield-CQ: A chaotic-quantum encryption framework with lightweight
   authentication for post-quantum secure consumer applications
SO ARRAY
AB The rapid expansion of consumer technologies such as Internet of Things devices, smart home systems, and wearable electronics has created new security challenges, especially as quantum computing threatens traditional encryption methods. This paper proposes PrivShield-CQ, a chaotic-quantum encryption framework designed for post-quantum secure consumer applications. The framework integrates a six-dimensional hyper-chaotic Chen system for high-entropy key generation with National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) standardized post-quantum algorithms, including Module Lattice Key Encapsulation Mechanism (ML-KEM), Module Lattice Digital Signature Algorithm (ML-DSA), and Stateless Hash Digital Signature Algorithm (SLH-DSA). Extensive experiments across devices such as ESP32, Raspberry Pi 4B, and Galaxy S23 demonstrate significant improvements: 99.7% quantum attack resistance, 65.4% lower authentication latency with 3.7 ms average response, 31.4% energy savings, and 33.0% extended battery life compared to existing post-quantum cryptography approaches. Shannon entropy analysis (7.9973/8.0) and successful completion of all 15 National Institute of Standards and Technology randomness tests confirm cryptographic strength. Validated through a six-month real-world deployment with over 10,000 secure interactions per hour, PrivShield-CQ bridges the gap between theoretical quantum-safe cryptography and practical consumer use, enabling scalable, energy-efficient, and quantum-resistant security for next-generation connected ecosystems.

TI Bell nonlocality in networks
SO REPORTS ON PROGRESS IN PHYSICS
AB Bell's theorem proves that quantum theory is inconsistent with local physical models. It has propelled research in the foundations of quantum theory and quantum information science. As a fundamental feature of quantum theory, it impacts predictions far beyond the traditional scenario of the Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen paradox. In the last decade, the investigation of nonlocality has moved beyond Bell's theorem to consider more sophisticated experiments that involve several independent sources which distribute shares of physical systems among many parties in a network. Network scenarios, and the nonlocal correlations that they give rise to, lead to phenomena that have no counterpart in traditional Bell experiments, thus presenting a formidable conceptual and practical challenge. This review discusses the main concepts, methods, results and future challenges in the emerging topic of Bell nonlocality in networks.

TI Passive and active suppression of transduced noise in silicon spin
   qubits
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Addressing and mitigating decoherence sources plays an essential role in the development of a scalable quantum computing system, which requires low gate errors to be consistently maintained throughout the circuit execution. While nuclear spin-free materials, such as isotopically purified silicon, exhibit intrinsically promising coherence properties for electron spin qubits, the omnipresent charge noise, when converted to magnetic noise under a strong magnetic field gradient, often hinders stable qubit operation within a time frame comparable to the data acquisition time. Here, we demonstrate both open- and closed-loop suppression techniques for the transduced noise in silicon spin qubits, resulting in a more than two-fold (ten-fold) improvement of the inhomogeneous coherence time (Rabi oscillation quality) that leads to a single-qubit gate fidelity of over 99.6% even in the presence of a strong decoherence field gradient. Utilizing gate set tomography, we show that adaptive qubit control also reduces the non-Markovian noise in the system, which validates the stability of the gate fidelity. The technique can be used to learn multiple Hamiltonian parameters and is useful for the intermittent calibration of the circuit parameters with affordable experimental overhead, providing a useful subroutine during the repeated execution of general quantum circuits.

TI Cryogenic Evaluation of a Digital-to-Analog Converter for a Trapped-Ion
   Quantum Computer
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INSTRUMENTATION AND MEASUREMENT
AB This article presents a digital-to-analog converter (DAC) for shuttling operations in a trapped-ion quantum computer (TIQC) measured at 4.6 K. We provide an extensive analysis and comparison of measured characteristics at room temperature (RT) versus those at cryogenic temperature (CT), particularly focusing on the DAC's static and dynamic behavior, as well as its noise performance. By making well-conceived analytical design choices, we show that the DAC's performance at CT can match its performance at RT. This is achieved through sufficient design margins, the selection of suitable components, and the adjustment of biasing voltages. The investigated chip features a 12 bit, resistive R-2R ladder-based DAC, which also comprises an input buffer for the DAC's reference voltage and a simplistic SPI to read the digital control words. Implemented in Infineon's 130-nm bipolar-CMOS-DMOS (BCD) technology, the DAC consumes 1.1 mW from a 1.5 V power supply at RT. Its power consumption increases to around 1.5 mW at CT due to necessary biasing adjustments. The DAC's linearity, characterized by its differential-nonlinearity (DNL) and integral-nonlinearity (INL), remains almost unchanged across temperatures, aligning with its spurious-free dynamic range (SFDR). The slew-rate (SR) decreases toward CT compared to RT. While the thermal noise floor also decreases, the low-frequency noise increases at CT. Overall, this leads to a slight decrease in the DAC's noise performance at 4.6 K.

TI Selective and noise-resilient wave estimation with quantum sensor
   networks
SO QUANTUM SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB We consider the selective sensing of planar waves in the presence of noise. We present different methods to control the sensitivity of a quantum sensor network, which allow one to decouple it from arbitrarily selected waves while retaining sensitivity to the signal. Comparing these methods with classical (non-entangled) sensor networks we demonstrate two advantages. First, entanglement increases precision by enabling the Heisenberg scaling. Second, entanglement enables the elimination of correlated noise processes corresponding to waves with different propagation directions, by exploiting decoherence-free subspaces. We then provide a theoretical and numerical analysis of the advantage offered by entangled quantum sensor networks, which is not specific to waves and can be of general interest. We demonstrate an exponential advantage in the regime where the number of sensor locations is comparable to the number of noise sources. Finally, we outline a generalization to other waveforms, e.g. spherical harmonics and general time-dependent fields.

TI Magnetic noise from metal objects near qubit arrays
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB All metal objects support fluctuating currents that are responsible for evanescent-wave Johnson noise in their vicinity due to both thermal and quantum effects. The noise fields can decohere qubits. It is quantified by the average value of B(x,t) B(x',t') and its time Fourier transform. We develop the formalism particularly for objects whose dimensions are small compared with the skin depth, which is the appropriate regime for nanoscale devices. This leads to a general and surprisingly simple formula for the two-point noise correlation function of an object of arbitrary shape. This formula has a clear physical interpretation in terms of induced currents in the object, and it can be the basis for straightforward numerical evaluation. We discuss its experimental implications. For a sphere, a solution is given in closed form in terms of a generalized multipole expansion. Plots of the solution illustrate the physical principles involved. We give examples of how the spatial pattern of noise can affect quantum information processing in nearby qubits. The theory implies that if the qubit system is miniaturized to a scale D, then decoherence rates of qubits scale as 1/D.

TI Quantum-Driven Energy-Efficiency Optimization for Next-Generation
   Communications Systems
SO ENERGIES
AB The advent of deep-learning technology promises major leaps forward in addressing the ever-enduring problems of wireless resource control and optimization, and improving key network performances, such as energy efficiency, spectral efficiency, transmission latency, etc. Therefore, a common understanding for quantum deep-learning algorithms is that they exploit advantages of quantum hardware, enabling massive optimization speed ups, which cannot be achieved by using classical computer hardware. In this respect, this paper investigates the possibility of resolving the energy efficiency problem in wireless communications by developing a quantum neural network (QNN) algorithm of deep-learning that can be tested on a classical computer setting by using any popular numerical simulation tool, such as Python. The computed results show that our QNN algorithm can be indeed trainable and that it can lead to solution convergence during the training phase. We also show that the proposed QNN algorithm exhibits slightly faster convergence speed than its classical ANN counterpart, which was considered in our previous work. Finally, we conclude that our solution can accurately resolve the energy efficiency problem and that it can be extended to optimize other communications problems, such as the global optimal power control problem, with promising trainability and generalization ability.

SO QUANTUM SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB One of the challenging scientific computing problems is topology optimization (TO), where the two tasks of searching through the combinatorially complex configurations and solving the constraints of partial differential equations need to be done simultaneously. In this paper, a novel variational quantum algorithm for constrained TO is proposed, which allows for the single-loop parallel search for the optimal configuration that also satisfies the physical constraints. The optimal configurations and the solutions to physical constraints are encoded with two separate quantum registers. A constraint encoding scheme is also proposed to incorporate volume and connectivity constraints in optimization. The gate complexity of the proposed quantum algorithm is analyzed. The algorithm is demonstrated with compliance minimization problems including truss structures and Messerschmitt-B & ouml;lkow-Blohm beams.

AB The complexity of industrial logistics and manufacturing processes increases constantly. As a key enabling technology of the upcoming decades, quantum computing is expected to play a crucial role in solving arising combinatorial optimization problems superior to traditional approaches. This study analyzes the current progress of quantum optimization applications in the logistics sector and aims to transfer an existing vehicle routing use case to a newly conceptualized matrix production use case regarding resource-efficient material flows. The simulation of the originating simple model is executed on a local circuit-based quantum simulator that emulates the behavior of real quantum hardware. Using a QAOA algorithm for problem-solving, optimal results have been achieved for all simulated scenarios. The theoretical material flow model is based on multiple assumptions and was created for testing reasons exclusively. (C) 2024 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

TI Virtual Distillation for Quantum Error Mitigation
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW X
AB Contemporary quantum computers have relatively high levels of noise, making it difficult to use them to perform useful calculations, even with a large number of qubits. Quantum error correction is expected to eventually enable fault-tolerant quantum computation at large scales, but until then, it will be necessary to use alternative strategies to mitigate the impact of errors. We propose a near-term friendly strategy to mitigate errors by entangling and measuring M copies of a noisy state rho. This enables us to estimate expectation values with respect to a state with dramatically reduced error rho M/Tro rho M thorn without explicitly preparing it, hence the name "virtual distillation." As M increases, this state approaches the closest pure state to rho exponentially quickly. We analyze the effectiveness of virtual distillation and find that it is governed in many regimes by the behavior of this pure state (corresponding to the dominant eigenvector of rho). We numerically demonstrate that virtual distillation is capable of suppressing errors by multiple orders of magnitude and explain how this effect is enhanced as the system size grows. Finally, we show that this technique can improve the convergence of randomized quantum algorithms, even in the absence of device noise.

TI A multiplexed synthesizer for non-Gaussian photonic quantum state
   generation
SO QUANTUM SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB Disposing of simple and efficient sources for photonic states with non-classical photon statistics is of paramount importance for implementing quantum computation and communication protocols. In this work, we propose an innovative approach that drastically simplifies the preparation of non-Gaussian states as compared to previous proposals, by taking advantage from the multiplexing capabilities offered by modern quantum photonics tools. Our proposal is inspired by iterative protocols, where multiple resources are combined one after the other for obtaining high-amplitude complex output states. Here, conversely, a large part of the protocol is performed in parallel, by using a single projective measurement along a mode which partially overlaps with all the input modes. We show that our protocol can be used to generate high-quality and high-amplitude Schrodinger cat states as well as more complex states such as error-correcting codes. Remarkably, our proposal can be implemented with experimentally available resources, highlighting its straightforward feasibility.

TI Automated Detection of Retinopathy of Prematurity Using Quantum Machine
   Learning and Deep Learning Techniques
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB Retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) is a vasoproliferative retinal disease that affects premature infants and causes permanent blindness if left untreated. Automated retinal diagnosis from the Retinal fundus images aid in the early detection of many pathological conditions. The low-level statistical features used in literatures have not provided the complete ROP-specific profile, and hence it has to be replaced by high-level features. The proposed system involves extracting Scale Invariant Feature Transform (SIFT) - Speeded Up Robust Features (SURF) combined high-level features from the SegNet segmented retinal vessels and classified using the Quantum Support Vector Machine (QSVM) classifier. This study aims (i) to segment retinal vessels from the acquired fundus images using SegNet and extract their features using the SURF and SIFT Feature Extraction method, (ii) to classify the Normal and ROP retinal vessels using four classical machine learning classifiers such as Support Vector Machine (SVM), Reduced Error Pruning (REP) tree, K-Star, and LogitBoost and Quantum SVM classifier, (iii) to develop a novel transformer-based Swin-T ROP model to classify ROP from normal Neonatal fundus images, (iv) to compare the performance characteristics of the proposed QSVM model with the Resnet50, DarkNet19, and classical machine learning classifiers. The study is conducted using 200 fundus images, including 100 normal and 100 ROP-positive neonatal retinal images. The machine learning classifiers such as SVM, REP Tree, K-Star, and Logit Boost Classifiers attained accuracy of 86.7%, 75%, 74%, and 76.5%, respectively, in classifying ROP from normal retinal images. The deep learning networks such as ResNet50 and DarkNet19 classified ROP from normal fundus images with an accuracy of 92.87% and 89%, respectively. The Quantum machine learning classifier outperforms the classical machine learning classifiers, Pre-trained Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and SwinT-ROP in terms of classification accuracy (95.5%), sensitivity (93%), and specificity (98%). The proposed system accurately diagnoses ROP from the neonatal fundus images and could be used in point-of-care diagnosis to access diagnostic expertise in underserved regions.

TI Comparison of the performance of classical and quantum machine-learning
   methods on the detection of sugar beet Cercospora leaf disease
SO PLANT PATHOLOGY
AB Image processing and machine-learning (ML) techniques are essential for the detection of diseases and pests in plants. This study explored the application of quantum ML (QML) algorithms for the early detection of Cercospora beticola leaf disease in sugar beet, which causes significant impact on global sugar production. Using a dataset of 1065 images (739 diseased and 326 healthy), we extracted 70 ML statistical features, including 10 from the grey-level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM) and 60 colour-related features. Performance evaluations of classical ML algorithms, such as random forest (RF; 91.95% accuracy) and extreme gradient boosting (91.95% accuracy), demonstrated strong results compared to quantum approaches. Notably, the quantum support vector classifier (QSVC) achieved an accuracy of 85% with perfect recall of 1.00, while the variational quantum classifier (VQC) recorded an accuracy of 88.73%. Dimensionality reduction via principal component analysis reduced features from 70 to 5, enabling effective classification with competitive results: ML (RF) 91.41%, VQC with limited-memory Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno with box constraints (L_BFGS_B) 88.73% and QSVC 85%. These findings highlight the potential of QML algorithms in improving agricultural disease identification and aiding in the advancement of more efficient, sustainable farming techniques.

TI The future of quantum technologies: superfluorescence from
   solution-processed, tunable materials
SO NANOPHOTONICS
AB One of the most significant and surprising recent developments in nanocrystal studies was the observation of superfluorescence from a system of self-assembled, colloidal perovskite nanocrystals [G. Raino, M. A. Becker, M. I. Bodnarchuk, R. F. Mahrt, M. V. Kovalenko, and T. Stoferle, "Superfluorescence from lead halide perovskite quantum dot superlattices," Nature, vol. 563, no. 7733, pp. 671-675, 2018]. Superfluorescence is a quantum-light property in which many dipoles spontaneously synchronize in phase to create a collective, synergistic photon emission with a much faster lifetime. Thus, it is surprising to observe this in more inhomogenous systems as solution-processed and colloidal structures typically suffer from high optical decoherence and non-homogeneous size distributions. Here we outline recent developments in the demonstration of superfluorescence in colloidal and solution-processed systems and explore the chemical and materials science opportunities allowed by such systems. The ability to create bright and tunable superfluorescent sources could enable transformative developments in quantum information applications and advance our understanding of quantum phenomena.

TI Amplifying Two-Mode Squeezing in Nanomechanical Resonators
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON QUANTUM ENGINEERING
AB Quantum squeezing plays a crucial role in enhancing the precision of quantum metrology and improving the efficiency of quantum information processing protocols. We thus propose a scheme to amplify two-mode squeezing in nanomechanical resonators, harnessing parametric amplification and two-tone laser controls. The red-detuned laser drives facilitate the cooling of the nanomechanical resonators down to their ground state and allow optimal quantum state transfer in the weak-coupling resolved sideband regime. In particular, the competing blue-detuned lasers in the driving pairs induce displacement squeezing in mechanical resonators. Thus, the quantum state transfer of squeezing in nanomechanical resonators and the intracavity correlated photons of the parametric amplifier significantly enhance two-mode mechanical squeezing. Notably, increasing the coupling strength of the red-detuned laser and the ratio of blue-to-red-detuned laser dramatically amplifies two-mode mechanical squeezing under realistic experimental parameters of a typical optomechanical system. Our findings reveal that the proposed cooperative mechanism effectively enhances the level of two-mode mechanical squeezing with a considerable improvement and demonstrates exceptional resilience to thermal noise.

TI Classical variational optimization of a PREPARE circuit for quantum
   phase estimation of quantum chemistry Hamiltonians
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB We propose a method for constructing PREPARE circuits for quantum phase estimation of a molecular Hamiltonian in quantum chemistry by using variational optimization of quantum circuits solely on classical computers. The PREPARE circuit generates a quantum state which encodes the coefficients of the terms in the Hamiltonian as probability amplitudes and plays a crucial role in the state-of-the-art efficient implementations of quantum phase estimation. We employ the automatic quantum circuit encoding algorithm [Shirakawa et al., Phys. Rev. Res. 6, 043008 (2024)] to construct PREPARE circuits, which requires classical simulations of quantum circuits of O(log N) qubits with N being the number of qubits of the Hamiltonian. The generated PREPARE circuits do not need any ancillary qubit. We demonstrate our method by investigating the number of T-gates of the obtained PREPARE circuits for quantum chemistry Hamiltonians of various molecules, which shows a constant-factor reduction compared to previous approaches that do not use ancillary qubits. Since the number of available logical qubits and T gates will be limited at the early stage of the fault-tolerant quantum computing, the proposed method is particularly of use for performing the quantum phase estimation with such limited capability.

AB A two-photon interfering technique based on polarization-resolved measurements is presented for the simultaneous estimation with maximum quantum sensitivity of multiple parameters associated with the polarization state of two interfering photonic qubits. This estimation is achieved by exploiting a novel interferometric technique based on polarization-resolved two-photon interference. The experimental feasibility and accuracy of this technique is shown, even when a limited number of sampling measurements is employed. This work is relevant for the development of quantum technologies with photonic qubits and sheds light on the physics at the interface between multiphoton interference, boson sampling, multi-parameter quantum sensing, and quantum information processing.

TI Coherent Atom Transport via Enhanced Shortcuts to Adiabaticity:
   Double-Well Optical Lattice
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW APPLIED
AB Theoretical studies of coherent atom transport have as yet mainly been restricted to one-dimensional model systems with harmonic trapping potentials. Here we investigate this important phenomenon???a prerequisite for a variety of quantum-technology applications based on cold neutral atoms???under much more complex physical circumstances. More specifically yet, we study fast atomic transport in a moving double-well optical lattice, whose three-dimensional (anharmonic) potential is nonseparable in the x -y plane. We first propose specific configurations of acousto-optic modulators that give rise to the moving -lattice effect in an arbitrary direction in this plane. We then determine moving-lattice trajectories that enable single-atom transport using two classes of quantum-control methods: shortcuts to adiabaticity (STA), here utilized in the form of inverse engineering based on a quadratic-in-momentum dynami-cal invariant of Lewis-Riesenfeld type, and their recently proposed modification termed enhanced STA (eSTA). Subsequently, we quantify the resulting single-atom dynamics by numerically solving the rele-vant time-dependent Schr??dinger equations and compare the efficiency of STA-and eSTA-based transport by evaluating the respective fidelities. We show that???except for the regime of shallow lattices???the eSTA method consistently outperforms its STA counterpart. This study has direct implications for neutral-atom quantum computing based on collisional entangling two-qubit gates and quantum sensing of constant homogeneous forces via guided-atom interferometry.

Preparing these states efficiently on hardware with constrained connectivity is a fundamental challenge. In this work, we establish a universal framework for graph state preparation using only Controlled-Z (CZ) gates along the edges of a given hardware connectivity graph and local complementation operations. We prove that any graph state can be prepared using only these operations, providing a constructive transpilation method that transforms the input circuit into an equivalent one without increasing the number of entangling gates. Additionally, as our approach preserves entangling count and depth of the input circuit, we show that this framework also allows for optimal graph state preparation.

TI Error Rate Analysis of Quantum-Annealing-Aided Multi-User Detection in
   Power-Domain Nonorthogonal Multiple Access
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB We present the error rate performance of quantum-annealing-aided multiuser detection (QA-aided MUD), a signal detection approach that combines quantum annealing (QA) with conventional iterative multiuser detection (MUD). This method utilizes QA to compute log-likelihood ratios (LLR), improving signal detection and enhancing connectivity in power-domain nonorthogonal multiple access (PD-NOMA) systems. However, owing to the limited computational resources of the QA hardware, a detailed error-rate analysis was not performed. In this study, we extend QA-aided MUD to digital annealing techniques and evaluate the error rate performance of uplink PD-NOMA systems. Block error rate (BLER) analysis demonstrates that QA-aided MUD outperforms the conventional successive interference cancellation (SIC) method when difference of received signal strength corresponding to devices at base station is small. Moreover, we revealed that tuning the annealing parameters is crucial to obtain such better BLER performance. Additionally, we conducted evaluation on a bit error rate (BER) with a few instances to compare the performance of the QA hardware and digital annealing techniques. The results indicate that signal detection can be achieved using all the annealing techniques. Finally, we present the latest challenges, including an over-the-air (OTA) experiment using QA-aided MUD.

TI High-fidelity control of spin ensemble dynamics via artificial
   intelligence: from quantum computing to NMR spectroscopy and imaging
SO PNAS NEXUS
AB High-fidelity control of spin ensemble dynamics is essential for many research areas, spanning from quantum computing and radio-frequency (RF) engineering to NMR spectroscopy and imaging. However, attaining robust and high-fidelity spin operations remains an unmet challenge. Using an evolutionary algorithm and artificial intelligence (AI), we designed new RF pulses with customizable spatial or temporal field inhomogeneity compensation. Compared with the standard RF shapes, the new AI-generated pulses show superior performance for bandwidth, robustness, and tolerance to field imperfections. As a benchmark, we constructed a spin entanglement operator for the weakly coupled two-spin-1/2 system of (CHCl3)-C-13, achieving high-fidelity transformations under multiple inhomogeneity sources. We then generated band-selective and ultra-broadband RF pulses typical of biomolecular NMR spectroscopy. When implemented in multipulse NMR experiments, the AI-generated pulses significantly increased the sensitivity of medium-size and large protein spectra relative to standard pulse sequences. Finally, we applied the new pulses to typical imaging experiments, showing a remarkable tolerance to changes in the RF field. These AI-generated RF pulses can be directly implemented in quantum information, NMR spectroscopy of biomolecules, magnetic resonance imaging techniques for in vivo and materials sciences.

TI Trends in High Performance Computing and Quantum Computing
SO JOURNAL OF COMPUTER SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY
AB High Performance Computing (HPC) applies different techniques to complex or large-volume applications, relying on both parallel software and hardware, to reduce their execution time compared to running them on a simple computer. On the other hand, Quantum Computing (QC) emerges as a new paradigm that leverages the properties of Quantum Mechanics for computation. QC has an inherently parallel nature and it is expected to solve some problems faster than classical computing. This paper carries out a bibliographic review to examine the point of view of different authors regarding the relationship between HPC and QC. The objective is to determine the trend of this relationship: Will QC replace classical HPC computing? or Will they complement each other? Also, if they were complementary tools, the aim is to answer: How could they be integrated? How will users access these resources?.

AB While quantum key distribution (QKD) is a theoretically secure way of growing quantum-safe encryption keys, many practical implementations are challenged due to various open attack vectors, resulting in many variations of QKD protocols. Side channels are one such vector that allows a passive or active eavesdropper to obtain QKD information leaked through practical devices. This paper assesses the feasibility and implications of extracting the raw secret key from far-field radiated emissions from the single-photon avalanche diodes used in a BB84 QKD quad-detector receiver. Enhancement of the attack was also demonstrated through the use of deep-learning model to distinguish radiated emissions due to the four polarized encoding states. To evaluate the severity of such side-channel attack, multi-class classification based on raw-data and pre-processed data is implemented and assessed. Results show that classifiers based on both raw-data and pre-processed features can discern variations of the electromagnetic emissions caused by specific orientations of the detectors within the receiver with an accuracy higher than 90%. This research proposes machine learning models as a technique to assess EM information leakage risk of QKD and highlights the feasibility of side-channel attacks in the far-field region, further emphasizing the need to utilise mechanisms to avoid electromagnetic radiation information leaks and measurement-device-independent QKD protocols.

TI Coexistence of 11 Tbps (110x100 Gbps) classical optical communication
   and quantum key distribution based on single-mode fiber
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB Integrating quantum key distribution (QKD) with classical optical communication is a deployment-friendly and cost-effective approach to advancing QKD network implementation. However, the noise introduced by intense classical signals into the quantum channel severely impacts the performance of the QKD system, presenting challenges for long-distance coexistence transmission. In this paper, we successfully demonstrate the simultaneous propagation of QKD and optical transport network (OTN) in the C-band over distances exceeding 100 km. We establish a coexistence transmission system based on a commercial OTN equipment and QKD device equipped with the Fabry-Perot filters, demonstrating the feasibility of combining QKD with 11 Tbps (110x100 x 100 Gbps) classical data over a 101.86 km fiber. To investigate longer transmission distances, we employ an optimized wavelength allocation method and conduct the co-propagation of QKD and 1 Tbps classical data over a 152.34 km fiber. To the best of our knowledge, these results are the first time that report the integration of QKD and large-capacity classical communication over hundred-kilometer scale fiber. Our works represent a significant advancement in developing OTN networks incorporating QKD systems.

TI Lie Groups for Quantum Complexity and Barren Plateau Theory
SO BRAZILIAN JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB Advances in quantum computing over the last two decades have required sophisticated mathematical frameworks to deepen the understanding of quantum algorithms. In this review, we introduce the theory of Lie groups and their algebras to analyze two fundamental problems in quantum computing as done in some recent works, e.g., Nielsen (Quantum Inf. Comput. 6(3), 213-262 2006) and Cerezo et al. (Nat. Rev. Phys. 3(9), 625-644 2021). Firstly, we describe the geometric formulation of quantum computational complexity, given by the length of the shortest path on the SU(2n)\documentclass[12pt]{minimal} \usepackage{amsmath} \usepackage{wasysym} \usepackage{amsfonts} \usepackage{amssymb} \usepackage{amsbsy} \usepackage{mathrsfs} \usepackage{upgreek} \setlength{\oddsidemargin}{-69pt} \begin{document}$$SU(2<^>n)$$\end{document} manifold with respect to a right-invariant Finsler metric. Secondly, we deal with the barren plateau phenomenon in variational quantum algorithms (VQAs), where we use the dynamical Lie algebra (DLA) to identify algebraic sources of untrainability.

TI Energy-Efficient, Cluster-Based Routing Protocol for Wireless Sensor
   Networks Using Fuzzy Logic and Quantum Annealing Algorithm
SO SENSORS
AB The main limitation of wireless sensor networks (WSNs) lies in their reliance on battery power. Therefore, the primary focus of the current research is to determine how to transmit data in a rational and efficient way while simultaneously extending the network's lifespan. In this paper, a hybrid of a fuzzy logic system and a quantum annealing algorithm-based clustering and routing protocol (FQA) is proposed to improve the stability of the network and minimize energy consumption. The protocol uses a fuzzy inference system (FIS) to select appropriate cluster heads (CHs). In the routing phase, we used the quantum annealing algorithm to select the optimal route from the CHs and the base station (BS). Furthermore, we defined an energy threshold to filter candidate CHs in order to save computation time. Unlike with periodic clustering, we adopted an on-demand re-clustering mechanism to perform global maintenance of the network, thereby effectively reducing the computation and overhead. The FQA was compared with FRNSEER, BOA-ACO, OAFS-IMFO, and FC-RBAT in different scenarios from the perspective of energy consumption, alive nodes, network lifetime, and throughput. According to the simulation results, the FQA outperformed all the other methods in all scenarios.

TI Parallel-in-time quantum simulation via Page and Wootters quantum time
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB In the past few decades, researchers have created a veritable zoo of quantum algorithms by drawing inspiration from classical computing, information theory, and even from physical phenomena. Here, we present quantum algorithms for parallel-in-time simulations that are inspired by the Page and Wootters formalism. In this framework, and thus in our algorithms, the classical time variable of quantum mechanics is promoted to the quantum realm by introducing a Hilbert space of "clock" qubits that are then entangled with the "system" qubits. We show that our algorithms can compute temporal properties over N different times of many-body systems by only using log(N) clock qubits. As such, we achieve an exponential trade-off between time and spatial complexities. In addition, we rigorously prove that the entanglement created between the system qubits and the clock qubits has operational meaning, as it encodes valuable information about the system's dynamics. We also provide a circuit depth estimation of all the protocols, showing a running time advantage in computation times over traditional sequential-in-time algorithms. In particular, for the case when the dynamics are determined by the Aubry-Andre model, we present a hybrid method for which our algorithms have a depth that only scales as O(log(N)n). As a by-product, we can relate the previous schemes to the problem of equilibration of an isolated quantum system, thus indicating that our framework enables a new dimension for studying dynamical properties of many-body systems.

TI Tight Bounds on Pauli Channel Learning without Entanglement
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB Quantum entanglement is a crucial resource for learning properties from nature, but a precise characterization of its advantage can be challenging. In this Letter, we consider learning algorithms without entanglement to be those that only utilize states, measurements, and operations that are separable between the main system of interest and an ancillary system. Interestingly, we show that these algorithms are equivalent to those that apply quantum circuits on the main system interleaved with mid-circuit measurements and classical feedforward. Within this setting, we prove a tight lower bound for Pauli channel learning without entanglement that closes the gap between the best-known upper and lower bound. In particular, we show that Theta(2n epsilon-2) rounds of measurements are required to estimate each eigenvalue of an n-qubit Pauli channel to epsilon error with high probability when learning without entanglement. In contrast, a learning algorithm with entanglement only needs Theta(epsilon-2) copies of the Pauli channel. The tight lower bound strengthens the foundation for an experimental demonstration of entanglement-enhanced advantages for

TI Variational Quantum Chemistry Programs in JaqalPaq
SO ENTROPY
AB We present example quantum chemistry programs written with JaqalPaq, a python meta-programming language used to code in Jaqal (Just Another Quantum Assembly Language). These JaqalPaq algorithms are intended to be run on the Quantum Scientific Computing Open User Testbed (QSCOUT) platform at Sandia National Laboratories. Our exemplars use the variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) quantum algorithm to compute the ground state energies of the H2, HeH+, and LiH molecules. Since the exemplars focus on how to program in JaqalPaq, the calculations of the second-quantized Hamiltonians are performed with the PySCF python package, and the mappings of the fermions to qubits are obtained from the OpenFermion python package. Using the emulator functionality of JaqalPaq, we emulate how these exemplars would be executed on an error-free QSCOUT platform and compare the emulated computation of the bond-dissociation curves for these molecules with their exact forms within the relevant basis.

TI A universal circuit set using the S3 quantum double
SO NPJ QUANTUM INFORMATION
AB One potential route toward fault-tolerant universal quantum computation is to use non-Abelian topological codes. In this work, we investigate how to achieve this goal with the quantum double model D(S3)\documentclass[12pt]{minimal} \usepackage{amsmath} \usepackage{wasysym} \usepackage{amsfonts} \usepackage{amssymb} \usepackage{amsbsy} \usepackage{mathrsfs} \usepackage{upgreek} \setlength{\oddsidemargin}{-69pt} \begin{document}$${\mathcal{D}}({S}_{3})$$\end{document}. By embedding each on-site Hilbert space into a qubit-qutrit pair, we explicitly construct circuits for creating, moving, and locally measuring all non-trivial anyons. We also design a specialized anyon interferometer to remotely measure the total charge of well-separated anyons; this avoids fusion, which compromises fault tolerance. These protocols enable the implementation of a universal gate set proposed by Cui et al. and active correction of the circuit-level noise during computation. To further suppress errors, we encode each physical degree of freedom of D(S3)\documentclass[12pt]{minimal} \usepackage{amsmath} \usepackage{wasysym} \usepackage{amsfonts} \usepackage{amssymb} \usepackage{amsbsy} \usepackage{mathrsfs} \usepackage{upgreek} \setlength{\oddsidemargin}{-69pt} \begin{document}$${\mathcal{D}}({S}_{3})$$\end{document} into a novel error-correcting code, enabling fault-tolerant realization, at the logical level, of all gates in the anyon manipulation circuits. Our proposal offers a promising path to realize robust universal topological quantum computation in the NISQ era.

TI Challenges and Advances in the Simulation of Targeted Covalent
   Inhibitors Using Quantum Computing
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY LETTERS
AB Targeted covalent inhibitors represent a promising class of drugs that form specific chemical bonds with their biological targets. There are a multitude of molecular systems where covalent inhibitors could address human health challenges. A high-level quantum chemical description of the formation of the critical covalent bond could provide new mechanistic detail and insights into how the mechanism is influenced by the surrounding biomolecular environment. However, accurately simulating the reactivity and binding specificity of such inhibitors remains a significant challenge. By leveraging advances in quantum computing hardware and algorithms, we discuss how quantum computing could benefit the design of targeted covalent inhibitors and enable more accurate simulations of protein-ligand interactions and accelerate de novo drug discovery.

TI Single Qubit Quantum Logistic-Sine XYZ-Rotation Maps: An Ultra-Wide
   Range Dynamics for Image Encryption
SO CMC-COMPUTERS MATERIALS & CONTINUA
AB Data security has become a growing priority due to the increasing frequency of cyber-attacks, necessitating the development of more advanced encryption algorithms. This paper introduces Single Qubit Quantum Logistic-Sine XYZ-Rotation Maps (SQQLSR), a quantum-based chaos map designed to generate one-dimensional chaotic sequences with an ultra-wide parameter range. The proposed model leverages quantum superposition using Hadamard gates and quantum rotations along the X, Y, and Z axes to enhance randomness. Extensive numerical experiments validate the effectiveness of SQQLSR. The proposed method achieves a maximum Lyapunov exponent (LE) of approximate to 55.265, surpassing traditional chaotic maps in unpredictability. The bifurcation analysis confirms a uniform chaotic distribution, eliminating periodic windows and ensuring higher randomness. The system also generates an expanded key space exceeding 1040, enhancing security against brute-force attacks. Additionally, SQQLSR is applied to image encryption using a simple three-layer encryption scheme combining permutation and substitution techniques. This approach is intentionally designed to highlight the impact of SQQLSR-generated chaotic sequences rather than relying on a complex encryption algorithm. The encryption method achieves an average entropy of 7.9994, NPCR above 99.6%, and UACI within 32.8%-33.8%, confirming its strong randomness and sensitivity to minor modifications. The robustness tests against noise, cropping, and JPEG compression demonstrate its resistance to statistical and differential attacks. Additionally, the decryption process ensures perfect image reconstruction with an infinite PSNR value, proving the algorithm's reliability. These results highlight SQQLSR's potential as a lightweight yet highly secure encryption mechanism suitable for quantum cryptography and secure communications.

TI Conceptual Review on Number Theoretic Transform and Comprehensive Review
   on Its Implementations
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB The Number Theoretic Transform (NTT) is a powerful mathematical tool that has become increasingly important in developing Post Quantum Cryptography (PQC) and Homomorphic Encryption (HE). Its ability to efficiently calculate polynomial multiplication using the convolution theorem with a quasi linear complexity O(n log n) when implemented with Fast Fourier Transform-style algorithms has made it a key component in modern cryptography. FFT-style NTT algorithm or fast-NTT is particularly useful in lattice-based cryptography, which relies on the hardness of certain mathematical problems to ensure security. Its importance in these fields continues to grow as quantum computing technology advances and traditional encryption methods become vulnerable. In this report, we discuss the mathematical concepts of polynomial multiplications using NTT and provide a comprehensive review of the latest implementation and state-ofthe-art of NTT in both PQC and HE schemes.

TI Quantum error reduction with deep neural network applied at the
   post-processing stage
SO QUANTUM INFORMATION PROCESSING
AB Deep neural networks (DNN) can be applied at the post-processing stage for the improvement of the results of quantum computations on noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) processors. Here, we propose a method based on this idea, which is most suitable for digital quantum simulation characterized by the periodic structure of quantum circuits consisting of Trotter steps. A key ingredient of our approach is that it does not require any data from a classical simulator at the training stage. The network is trained to transform data obtained from quantum hardware with artificially increased Trotter steps number (noise level) toward the data obtained without such an increase. The additional Trotter steps are fictitious, i.e., they contain negligibly small rotations and, in the absence of hardware imperfections, reduce essentially to the identity gates. This preserves, at the training stage, information about relevant quantum circuit features. Two particular examples are considered that are the dynamics of the transverse-field Ising chain and XY spin chain, which were implemented on two real five-qubit IBM Q processors. A significant error reduction is demonstrated as a result of the DNN application that allows us to effectively increase quantum circuit depth in terms of Trotter steps.

AB The Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) algorithm is gaining interest for its potential use in near-term quantum devices. In the VQE algorithm, parameterized quantum circuits (PQCs) are employed to prepare quantum states, which are then utilized to compute the expectation value of a given Hamiltonian. Designing efficient PQCs is crucial for improving convergence speed. In this study, we introduce problem-specific PQCs tailored for optimization problems by dynamically generating PQCs that incorporate problem constraints. This approach reduces a search space by focusing on unitary transformations that benefit the VQE algorithm, and accelerate convergence. Our experimental results demonstrate that the convergence speed of our proposed PQCs outperforms state-of-the-art PQCs, highlighting the potential of problem-specific PQCs in optimization problems.

TI Finite-Resource Performance of Small-Satellite-Based
   Quantum-Key-Distribution Missions
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB In satellite-based quantum-key-distribution (QKD), the number of secret bits that can be generated in a single satellite pass over the ground station is severely restricted by the pass duration and the free-space optical channel loss. High channel loss may decrease the signal-to-noise ratio due to background noise, reduce the number of generated raw key bits, and increase the quantum bit error rate (QBER), all of which have detrimental effects on the output secret key length. Under finite-size security analysis, a higher QBER increases the minimum raw key length necessary for nonzero secret-key-length extraction due to less efficient reconciliation and postprocessing overheads. We show that recent developments in finite-key analysis allow three different small-satellite-based QKD projects, CQT-Sat, the United Kingdom QUARCROKS, and QEYSSat, to produce secret keys even under conditions of very high loss, improving on estimates based on previous finite-key bounds. This suggests that satellites in low Earth orbit can satisfy finite-size security requirements but that this remains challenging for satellites further from Earth. We analyze the performance of each mission to provide an informed route toward improving the performance of small-satellite QKD missions. We highlight the short- and long-term perspectives on the challenges and potential future developments in small-satellite-based QKD and quantum networks. In particular, we discuss some of the experimental and theoretical bottlenecks and the improvements necessary to achieve QKD and wider quantum networking capabilities in daylight and at different altitudes.

TI Entanglement Assisted Radars With Transmitter Side Optical Phase
   Conjugation and Classical Coherent Detection
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB Entanglement is a unique quantum information processing feature. With the help of entanglement we can build quantum sensors whose sensitivity is better than that of classical sensors. In this paper we are concerned with the entanglement assisted (EA) bistatic quantum radar applications. By employing the optical phase conjugation (OPC) on transmitter side and classical coherent detection on receiver side we show that the detection probability of the proposed EA target detection scheme is significantly better than that of corresponding classical and coherent states-based quantum detection schemes. The proposed EA target detection scheme is evaluated by modelling the radar return channel as the lossy and noisy Bosonic channel and assuming imperfect distribution of entanglement over the idler channel.

TI Long-lived coherence in driven many-spin systems: from two to infinite
   spatial dimensions
SO NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB Long-lived coherences, emerging under periodic pulse driving in the disordered ensembles of strongly interacting spins, offer immense advantages for future quantum technologies, but the physical origin and the key properties of this phenomenon remain poorly understood. We theoretically investigate this effect in ensembles of different dimensionality, and predict existence of the long-lived coherences in all such systems, from two-dimensional to infinite-dimensional (where every spin is coupled to all others with similar strength), which are of particular importance for quantum sensing and quantum information processing. We explore the transition from two to infinite dimensions, and show that the long-time coherence dynamics in all dimensionalities is qualitatively similar, although the short-time behavior is drastically different, exhibiting dimensionality-dependent singularity. Our study establishes the common physical origin of the long-lived coherences in different dimensionalities, and suggests that this effect is a generic feature of the strongly coupled spin systems with positional disorder. Our results lay out foundation for utilizing the long-lived coherences in a range of application, from quantum sensing with two-dimensional spin ensembles, to quantum information processing with the infinitely-dimensional spin systems in the cavity-QED settings.

TI Coherent Spin Preparation of Indium Donor Qubits in Single ZnO Nanowires
SO NANO LETTERS
AB Shallow donors in ZnO are promising candidates for photon-mediated quantum technologies. Utilizing the indium donor, we show that favorable donor-bound exciton optical and electron spin properties are retained in isolated ZnO nanowires. The inhomogeneous optical line width of single nanowires (60 GHz) is within a factor of 2 of bulk single-crystalline ZnO. Spin initialization via optical pumping is demonstrated and coherent population trapping is observed. The two-photon absorption width approaches the theoretical limit expected due to the hyperfine interaction between the indium nuclear spin and the donor-bound electron.

TI A linear photonic swap test circuit for quantum kernel estimation
SO QUANTUM SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB The swap test is a quantum algorithm capable of computing the absolute value of the scalar product of two arbitrary wavefunctions. Scalar products represent a crucial ingredient to many quantum machine learning (QML) methods, but their evaluation is not straightforward at all. For this reason, many research efforts have been made without achieving an efficient and robust implementation. Here, we present an integrated photonic circuit designed to implement the swap test algorithm. Our approach relies solely on linear optical integrated components and qudits, represented by single photons from an attenuated laser beam propagating through a set of waveguides. By utilizing 23 spatial degrees of freedom for the qudits, we can configure all the necessary arrangements to set any two-qubit state and perform the swap test. This simplifies the requirements on the circuitry elements and eliminates the need for non-linearity, heralding, or post-selection to achieve multi-qubit gates. Our photonic swap test circuit successfully encodes two qubits and estimates their scalar product with a measured root mean square error smaller than 0.05. This result paves the way for the development of integrated photonic architectures capable of performing QML tasks with robust devices operating at room temperature.

TI Verifying Hierarchic Multipartite and Network Nonlocalities with a
   Unified Method
SO ADVANCED QUANTUM TECHNOLOGIES
AB The multipartite nonlocality provides deep insights into the fundamental feature of quantum mechanics and guarantees different degrees of cryptography security for potential applications in the quantum internet. Verifying multipartite nonlocal correlations is a difficult task. A unified approach is proposed that encompasses all the quantum characteristics of the multipartite correlated system beyond from fully separable to biseparable no-signaling correlations. A straightforward method is offered to verify general systems by lifting partial nonlocal correlations. This allows to construct a chained Bell inequality, facilitating the unified verification of hierarchic multipartite nonlocalities. The lifting method is finally applied to verify the correlations derived from quantum networks.
   1) This paper presents a unified way to encompass separable correlations. 2) The present model can verify hierarchic multipartite nonlocal correlations by violating a unified Bell inequality. 3) The present method witnesses the genuine entanglement by lifting some entanglement witnesses on low-dimensional states. image

TI Mixer-phaser Ansatze for quantum optimization with hard constraints
SO QUANTUM MACHINE INTELLIGENCE
AB We introduce multiple parametrized circuit ansatze and present the results of a numerical study comparing their performance with a standard Quantum Alternating Operator Ansatz approach. The ansatze are inspired by mixing and phase separation in the QAOA, and also motivated by compilation considerations with the aim of running on near-term superconducting quantum processors. The methods are tested on random instances of a quadratic binary constrained optimization problem that is fully connected for which the space of feasible solutions has constant Hamming weight. For the parameter setting strategies and evaluation metric used, the average performance achieved by the QAOA is effectively matched by the one obtained by a "mixer-phaser" ansatz that can be compiled in less than half-depth of standard QAOA on most superconducting qubit processors.

TI Multilingual multi-task quantum transfer learning
SO QUANTUM MACHINE INTELLIGENCE
AB Hybrid quantum-classical algorithms have emerged as promising candidates for overcoming current limitations of deep learning techniques and recently have attracted a lot of attention for their application in natural language processing (NLP). Among the potential applications of quantum computing in this field, quantum transfer learning-using quantum circuits for fine-tuning pre-trained classical models specific to a task-is regarded as a potential avenue to exploit the potentiality of quantum computers. This study validates, both experimentally and with domain knowledge analysis, the efficacy of quantum transfer learning for two distinct NLP tasks-semantic and syntactic-and employ multilingual data encompassing both English and Italian. In particular is hereby demonstrated that embedded knowledge coming from pre-trained deep learning models can be effectively transferred into a quantum classifier, which shows good performances, either comparable or potentially better than their classical counterparts, with a further reduction of parameters compared to a purely classical classifier. Furthermore, a qualitative linguistic analysis of the results is presented, that elucidates two points: the lack of language dependence in the quantum models and the ability to discriminate with higher precision than standard classifiers, sub-types of linguistic structures.

TI Entropy disorder and quantum correlations in two Unruh-deWitt detectors
   uniformly accelerating and interacting with a massless scalar field
SO PHYSICA SCRIPTA
AB This investigation focuses on studying the dynamics of entropy disorder and quantum correlations between two detectors interacting with a scalar field in a four-dimensional Minkowski space-time using the Unruh-deWitt model. The aim is to gain insights into the evolution of quantum resources in uniformly accelerated detectors that interact with a massless scalar field. To achieve this, useful metrics such as local quantum Fisher information (LQFI), quantum consonance, and linear entropy are employed to analyze the quantum correlations and entropy disorder. The results indicate that the quantum correlations are heavily reliant on the choice of the initial state of the detectors. Interestingly, the quantum correlations exhibit a surprising resurgence as the Unruh temperature increases for specific initial state parameters. However, for other values, the Unruh temperature takes over and leads to a monotonic decrease in the quantum correlations. In addition, the degree of disorder is observed to increase as the Unruh temperature increases. Furthermore, the investigation delves into how the energy spacing of the detector affects quantum correlations across various initial state parameters. Further elucidating the behavior of quantum resources in curved space-time, we demonstrate that some initial state parameters can cause sudden changes in correlation measures as a function of energy spacing. These results highlight the relevance of choosing adequate initial state parameters, as they have a significant impact on the variation of quantum resources in two Unruh-deWitt detectors.

TI Emergent Macroscopic Bistability Induced by a Single Superconducting
   Qubit
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB The photon blockade breakdown in a continuously driven cavity QED system has been proposed as a prime example for a first-order driven-dissipative quantum phase transition. However, the predicted scaling from a microscopic behavior-dominated by quantum fluctuations-to a macroscopic one-characterized by stable phases-and the associated exponents and phase diagram have not been observed so far. In this work we couple a single transmon qubit with a fixed coupling strength g to a superconducting cavity that is in situ bandwidth kappa tunable to controllably approach this thermodynamic limit. Even though the system remains microscopic, we observe its behavior becoming increasingly macroscopic as a function of g/kappa. For the highest realized g/kappa of approximately 287, the system switches with a characteristic timescale as long as 6 s between a bright coherent state with approximately 8 x 103 intracavity photons and the vacuum state. This exceeds the microscopic timescales by 6 orders of magnitude and approaches the perfect hysteresis expected between two macroscopic attractors in the thermodynamic limit. These findings and interpretation are qualitatively supported by neoclassical theory and large-scale quantum-jump Monte Carlo simulations. Besides shedding more light on driven-dissipative physics in the limit of strong light-matter coupling, this system might also find applications in quantum sensing and metrology.

TI Strain-induced variation in quantum dot emissions close to Si-vacancy
   transitions
SO AIP ADVANCES
AB Solid-state quantum platforms have great potential as well-controllable, scalable devices for applications in quantum communication. Semiconductor quantum dots are a leading candidate for the deterministic generation of high-quality single or entangled photons. Wavelength tunability is a fundamental requirement for the interference of a large number of local emitters, enhancing their scalability. Here, we explore the strain tuning of GaAs/AlGaAs quantum dots emitting single photons close to the transitions of negatively charged Si-vacancy centers in diamonds, which are high-performance quantum memories with an efficient spin-photon interface. The emission wavelength is tuned by applying strain to quantum-dot-containing nanomembranes via micro-structured piezoelectric actuators, and wavelength resonance is achieved between two different quantum dots in the device. Changes in the binding energy of different trion complexes are observed, as well as the reduction of the neutral exciton fine structure. We envisage that such implementations facilitate the heterogeneous integration of quantum photonic devices, integrating both solid-state quantum light sources and memories by adapting their characteristics.

TI Single-ancilla ground state preparation via Lindbladians
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB We design a quantum algorithm for ground state preparation in the early fault tolerant regime. As a Monte Carlo style quantum algorithm, our method features a Lindbladian where the target state is stationary. The construction of this Lindbladian is algorithmic and should not be seen as a specific approximation to some weakly coupled system-bath dynamics in nature. Our algorithm can be implemented using just one ancilla qubit and efficiently simulated on a quantum computer. It can prepare the ground state even when the initial state has zero overlap with the ground state, bypassing the most significant limitation of methods like quantum phase estimation. As a variant, we also propose a discrete-time algorithm, demonstrating even better efficiency and providing a near-optimal simulation cost depending on the desired evolution time and precision. Numerical simulations using Ising and Hubbard models demonstrate the efficacy and applicability of our method.

TI Superstatistics and quantum entanglement in the isotropic spin-1/2
   XX dimer from a nonadditive thermodynamics perspective
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW E
AB In this paper, the impact of temperature fluctuations in the entanglement of two qubits described by a spin-1/2 XX model is studied. To describe the out-of-equilibrium situation, superstatistics is used with fluctuations given by a chi(2)-distribution function, and its free parameters are chosen in such a way that resembles the nonadditive Tsallis thermodynamics. In order to preserve the Legendre structure of the thermal functions, particular energy constraints are imposed on the density operator and the internal energy. Analytical results are obtained using an additional set of constraints after a parametrization of the physical temperature. We show that the well-known parametrization may lead to undesirable values of the physical temperature so that by analyzing the entropy as a function of energy, the correct values are found. The quantum entanglement is obtained from the concurrence and is compared with the case when the Tsallis restrictions are not imposed on the density operator.

TI Evaluating Ground State Energies of Chemical Systems with Low-Depth
   Quantum Circuits and High Accuracy
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY A
AB Quantum computers have the potential to efficiently solve the electronic structure problem but are currently limited by noise and shallow circuits. We present an enhanced Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) ansatz based on the Qubit Coupled Cluster (QCC) approach that requires optimization of only n parameters, where n is the number of Pauli string generators, rather than the typical n + 2m parameters, where m is the number of qubits. We evaluate the ground state energies and molecular dissociation curves of strongly correlated molecules, namely O3 and Li4, using active spaces of varying sizes in conjunction with our enhanced QCC ansatz, Unitary Coupled Cluster Single-Double (UCCSD) ansatz, and the classical Coupled Cluster Singles and Doubles (CCSD) method. Compared to UCCSD, our approach significantly reduces the number of parameters while maintaining high accuracy. Numerical simulations demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, and experiments on superconducting and trapped-ion quantum computers showcase its practicality on real hardware. By eliminating the need for symmetry-restoring gates and reducing the number of parameters, our enhanced QCC ansatz enables accurate quantum chemistry calculations on near-term quantum devices for strongly correlated systems.

TI Noise-induced phase transitions in hybrid quantum circuits
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
AB The presence of quantum noises inherent to real physical systems can strongly impact the physics in hybrid quantum circuits with local random unitaries and midcircuit measurements. The quantum noises with a size-independent occurring probability can lead to the disappearance of a measurement-induced entanglement phase transition and the emergence of a single area-law phase. In this work, we investigate the effects of quantum noises with size-dependent probabilities q = p/L-alpha, where alpha represents the scaling exponent. We have identified a noise-induced entanglement phase transition from a volume law to a power (area) law in the presence (absence) of measurements as p increases when alpha = 1. With the help of an effective statistical model, we reveal that the phase transition is of first order arising from the competition between two types of spin configurations and shares the same analytical understanding as the noise-induced coding transition. This unified picture further deepens the understanding of the connection between entanglement behavior and the capacity of information protection. When alpha not equal 1, one spin configuration always dominates regardless of p and thus the phase transition disappears. Moreover, we highlight the difference between the effects of size-dependent bulk noise and boundary noises. We validate our analytical predictions with extensive numerical results from stabilizer circuit simulations.

TI A demonstration of contextuality using quantum computers
SO EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB Open-access, online quantum computers have shown significant improvements in the past decade. Although they still suffer from noise and scalability limitations, they do offer the possibility of experimenting with quantum circuits which would otherwise have required laboratory resources and prowesses beyond the reach of most students (and even researchers). In view of this, we revisit from the ground up the notion of contextuality and show that it can now be easily demonstrated on one of the IBM quantum computers. We showcase this with an implementation of the Peres-Mermin square which, despite the high error rates, manages to violate noncontextuality by almost 28 standard deviations.

TI Efficient quantum thermal simulation
SO NATURE
AB Quantum computers promise to tackle quantum simulation problems that are classically intractable1. Although a lot of quantum algorithms2, 3-4 have been developed for simulating quantum dynamics, a general-purpose method for simulating low-temperature quantum phenomena remains unknown. In classical settings, the analogous task of sampling from thermal distributions has been largely addressed by Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods5,6. Here we propose an efficient quantum algorithm for thermal simulation that-akin to MCMC methods-exhibits detailed balance, respects locality and serves as a toy model for thermalization in open quantum systems. The enduring impact of MCMC methods suggests that our new construction may play an equally important part in quantum computing and applications in the physical sciences and beyond.

TI KINA: Karatsuba Initiated Novel Accelerator for Ring-Binary-LWE
   (RBLWE)-Based Post-Quantum Cryptography
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON VERY LARGE SCALE INTEGRATION (VLSI) SYSTEMS
AB Along with the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) post-quantum cryptography (PQC) standardization process, lightweight PQC-related research, and development have also gained substantial attention from the research community. Ring-binary-learning-with-errors (RBLWE), a ring variant of binary-LWE (BLWE), has been used to build a promising lightweight PQC scheme for emerging Internet-of-Things (IoT) and edge computing applications, namely the RBLWEbased encryption scheme (RBLWE-ENC). The parameter settings of RBLWE-ENC, however, are not in favor of deploying typical fast algorithms like number theoretic transform (NTT). Following this direction, in this work, we propose a Karatsuba initiated novel accelerator (KINA) for efficient implementation of RBLWE-ENC. Overall, we have made several coherent interdependent stages of efforts to carry out the proposed work: 1) we have innovatively used the Karatsuba algorithm (KA) to derive the major arithmetic operation of RBLWE-ENC into a new form for high-performance operation; 2) we have then effectively mapped the proposed algorithm into an efficient hardware accelerator with the help of a number of optimization techniques; and 3) we have also provided detailed complexity analysis and implementation comparison to demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed KINA, e.g., the proposed design with u = 2 involves 64.71% higher throughput and 15.37% less area-delay product (ADP) than the state-of-theart design for n = 512 (Virtex-7). The proposed KINA offers flexible processing speed and is suitable for high-performance applications like IoT servers. This work is expected to be useful for lightweight PQC development. curve already categories

TI Unitary and entangling solutions to the parametric Yang-Baxter equation
   in all dimensions
SO PHYSICS OPEN
AB We present a new class of solutions to the parameter-dependent Yang-Baxter equation across all dimensions, which includes a significant subclass of unitary and entangling solutions. In any dimension >= 2, we construct a well-structured matrix () that exhibits intriguing and useful symmetries. A key feature of () is its composition from four monomial-based layers: () = ()+ ()+ ()+ (), where (), (), () and () are four sets of monomial complex functions of the form, , , and , respectively. This well-designed structure plays a crucial role in demonstrating that () is indeed a solution to the Yang-Baxter equation and in establishing the conditions for its unitarity and entangling properties. Additionally, it allows us to identify interesting non-trivial subfamilies with these properties. As is widely recognized, unitary and entangling solutions to the Yang-Baxter equation serve as universal quantum logic gates for qudit quantum computing. Moreover, the search for new solutions to the Yang-Baxter equation in higher dimensions is a common endeavor in both mathematics and physics.

TI Vantablack Shielding of Superconducting Qubit Systems
SO JOURNAL OF LOW TEMPERATURE PHYSICS
AB Circuit quantum electrodynamics (cQED) experiments on superconducting qubit systems typically employ radiation shields coated in photon absorbing materials to achieve high qubit coherence and low microwave resonator losses. In this work, we present preliminary results on the performance of Vantablack as a novel infrared (IR) shielding material for cQED systems. We compare the coherence properties and residual excited state population (or effective qubit temperature) of a single-junction transmon qubit housed in a shield coated with a standard epoxy-based IR absorbing material, i.e. Berkeley Black, to the coherence and effective temperature of the same qubit in a shield coated in Vantablack. Based on a statistical analysis of multiple qubit coherence measurements, we find that the performance of the radiation shield coated with Vantablack is comparable in performance to the standard coating. However, we find that in the Vantablack coated shield the qubit has a higher effective temperature. These results indicate that improvements are likely required to optimize the performance of Vantablack as an IR shielding material for superconducting qubit experiments and we discuss possible routes for such improvements. Finally, we describe possible future experiments to more precisely quantify the performance of Vantablack to improve the coherences of more complex cQED systems.

TI Quantum Digital Signature Using Entangled States for Network
SO ENTROPY
AB We propose an entanglement-based quantum digital signature (QDS) protocol optimized for quantum networks. The protocol follows the Lamport-inspired QDS paradigm but eliminates QKD post-processing by signing and verifying with raw conclusive keys, thereby reducing latency and implementation complexity. We provide a finite-size security analysis of robustness, unforgeability, and non-repudiation. Under standard fiber-loss and detector models, simulations show a consistent signature rate advantage over a representative Lamport-inspired QDS baseline across metro-to-regional distances. The proposed protocol is practical for near-term deployment while preserving end-to-end, finite key security guarantees.

TI Room-temperature control and electrical readout of individual
   nitrogen-vacancy nuclear spins
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Nuclear spins in semiconductors are leading candidates for future quantum technologies, including quantum computation, communication, and sensing. Nuclear spins in diamond are particularly attractive due to their long coherence time. With the nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centre, such nuclear qubits benefit from an auxiliary electronic qubit, which, at cryogenic temperatures, enables probabilistic entanglement mediated optically by photonic links. Here, we demonstrate a concept of a microelectronic quantum device at ambient conditions using diamond as wide bandgap semiconductor. The basic quantum processor unit - a single N-14 nuclear spin coupled to the NV electron - is read photoelectrically and thus operates in a manner compatible with nanoscale electronics. The underlying theory provides the key ingredients for photoelectric quantum gate operations and readout of nuclear qubit registers. This demonstration is, therefore, a step towards diamond quantum devices with a readout area limited by inter-electrode distance rather than by the diffraction limit. Such scalability could enable the development of electronic quantum processors based on the dipolar interaction of spin-qubits placed at nanoscopic proximity. Nuclear spins in diamond are promising for applications in quantum technologies due to their long coherence times. Here, the authors demonstrate a scalable electrical readout of individual intrinsic N-14 nuclear spins in diamond, mediated by hyperfine coupling to electron spin of the NV center, as a step towards room-temperature nanoscale diamond quantum devices.

TI Estimating the Bias of CX Gates via Character Randomized Benchmarking
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB Recent work has demonstrated that high-threshold quantum error correction is possible for biased -noise qubits, provided that one can implement a controlled-sc not (CX) gate that preserves the bias. Bias-preserving CX gates have been proposed for several biased-noise qubit platforms, most notably Kerr cats. However, experimentally measuring the noise bias is challenging, as it requires accurately estimat-ing certain low-probability Pauli errors in the presence of much larger state-preparation-and-measurement (SPAM) errors. In this paper, we introduce bias-randomized benchmarking (BRB) as a technique for measuring bias in quantum gates. BRB, like all RB protocols, is highly accurate and immune to SPAM errors. Our first protocol, CX-dihedral BRB, is a straightforward method to measure the bias of the entire CX-dihedral group. Our second protocol, interleaved-bias randomized benchmarking (IBRB), is a gener-alization of interleaved RB tailored to the experimental constraints of biased-noise qubits; this is a more involved procedure that directly targets the bias of the CX gate alone. Our BRB procedures occupy a middle ground between classic RB protocols that only estimate the average fidelity and tomographic RB protocols that provide more detailed characterization of noise but require more measurements as well as experimental capabilities that are not necessarily available in biased-noise qubits.

TI From Subset-Sum to Decoding: Improved Classical and Quantum Algorithms
   via Ternary Representation Technique
SO INFORMATION
AB The subset-sum problem, a foundational NP-hard problem in theoretical computer science, serves as a critical building block for cryptographic constructions. This work introduces novel classical and quantum heuristic algorithms for the random subset-sum problem at density d=1, where exactly one solution is expected. Classically, we propose the first algorithm based on a ternary tree representation structure, inspired by recent advances in lattice-based cryptanalysis. Through numerical optimization, our method achieves a time complexity of & Oscr;20.2400n and space complexity of & Oscr;20.2221n, improving upon the previous best classical heuristic result of & Oscr;20.2830n. In the quantum setting, we develop a corresponding algorithm by integrating the classical ternary representation technique with a quantum walk search framework. The optimized quantum algorithm attains a time and space complexity of & Oscr;20.1843n, surpassing the prior state-of-the-art quantum heuristic of & Oscr;20.2182n. Furthermore, we apply our algorithms to information set decoding in code-based cryptography. For half-distance decoding, our classical algorithm improves the time complexity to & Oscr;20.0453n, surpassing the previous best of & Oscr;20.0465n. For full-distance decoding, we achieve a quantum complexity of & Oscr;20.058326n, advancing beyond the prior best quantum result of & Oscr;20.058696n. These findings demonstrate the broad applicability and efficiency of our ternary representation technique across both classical and quantum computational models.

TI Quantum network approach to spin interferometry driven by Abelian and
   non-Abelian fields
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
AB We present a theory of conducting quantum networks that accounts for Abelian and non-Abelian fields acting on spin carriers. We apply this approach to model the conductance of mesoscopic spin interferometers of different geometry (such as squares and rings), reproducing recent experimental findings in nanostructured InAsGa quantum wells subject to Rashba spin-orbit and Zeeman fields (as, e.g., the manipulation of Aharonov-Casher interference patterns by geometric means). Moreover, by introducing an additional field-texture engineering, we manage to single out a previously unnoticed spin-phase suppression mechanism. We notice that our approach can also be used for the study of complex networks and the spectral properties of closed systems.

TI Room-temperature quantum sensing with photoexcited triplet electrons in
   organic crystals
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Quantum sensors have notably advanced high-sensitivity magnetic field detection. Here, we report quantum sensors constructed from polarized spin-triplet electrons in photoexcited organic chromophores, specifically focusing on pentacene-doped para-terphenyl (approximate to 0.1%). We demonstrate essential quantum sensing properties at room temperature (RT): optically generated electronic polarization and state-dependent fluorescence contrast by leveraging differential pumping and relaxation rates between triplet and ground states. We measure high optically detected magnetic resonance contrast approximate to 16.8% of the triplet states at RT, along with long coherence times under spin echo and Carr-Purcell-Meiboom-Gill (CPMG) sequences, T2 = 2.7 mu s and T DD respectively, limited only by the triplet lifetimes. The material offers several advantages for quantum sensing, including the ability to grow large (cm scale) crystals at low cost, absence of paramagnetic impurities, and electronic diamagnetism when not optically illuminated. Utilizing pentacene as a representative of a broader class of spin triplet- polarizable organic molecules, this paper highlights the potential for quantum sensing in chemical systems.

TI Multiparty weighted threshold quantum secret sharing based on the
   Chinese remainder theorem to share quantum information
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB Secret sharing is a widely-used security protocol and cryptographic primitive in which all people cooperate to restore encrypted information. The characteristics of a quantum field guarantee the security of information; therefore, many researchers are interested in quantum cryptography and quantum secret sharing (QSS) is an important research topic. However, most traditional QSS methods are complex and difficult to implement. In addition, most traditional QSS schemes share classical information, not quantum information which makes them inefficient to transfer and share information. In a weighted threshold QSS method, each participant has each own weight, but assigning weights usually costs multiple quantum states. Quantum state consumption will therefore increase with the weight. It is inefficient and difficult, and therefore not able to successfully build a suitable agreement. The proposed method is the first attempt to build multiparty weighted threshold QSS method using single quantum particles combine with the Chinese remainder theorem (CRT) and phase shift operation. The proposed scheme allows each participant has its own weight and the dealer can encode a quantum state with the phase shift operation. The dividing and recovery characteristics of CRT offer a simple approach to distribute partial keys. The reversibility of phase shift operation can encode and decode the secret. The proposed weighted threshold QSS scheme presents the security analysis of external attacks and internal attacks. Furthermore, the efficiency analysis shows that our method is more efficient, flexible, and simpler to implement than traditional methods.

AB Combining several primitives together to offer greater security is an old idea in cryptography. Recently, this concept has resurfaced as it could be used to improve trust in new Post-Quantum (PQ) schemes and smooth the transition to PQ cryptography. In particular, several ways to combine key exchange mechanisms (KEMs) into a secure hybrid KEM have been proposed. In this work, we observe that most PQ KEMs are built using a variant of the Fujisaki-Okamoto (FO) transform. Thus, we propose several efficient combiners that take OW-CPA public-key encryption schemes (PKEs) and directly build hybrid IND-CCA KEMs. Our constructions are secure in the ROM and QROM and can be seen as generalizations of the FO transform. We also study how the hash functions (ROs) used in our transforms can be combined in order to improve efficiency and security. In a second part, we implement a hybrid KEM using one of our combiners as a proof-of-concept and benchmark it. More precisely, we build a hybrid IND-CCA KEM from the CPA-secure versions of HQC and LAC, two NIST Round 2 PQ proposals. We show that the resulting KEM offers comparable performances to HQC, thus improving security at a small cost. Finally, we discuss which PQ schemes should be combined in order to offer the best efficiency/security trade-off.

TI Manipulating bipartite and tripartite quantum correlations of mechanical
   oscillators via optomechanical interaction
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB The entanglement of macroscopic mechanical oscillators is always an interesting domain. How to entangle multiple mechanical oscillators is still not well answered. In this paper, we investigate the bipartite and tripartite quantum correlations among three distinct mechanical oscillators interacting with one cavity pumped by a multi-tone driving laser. Floquet cavity modes, resulting from different frequency components of the multi-tone driven cavity, are used to construct channels for quantum correlations between mechanical oscillators. By modulating the effective optomechanical coupling, we can manipulate the mechanical entanglement and EPR steering. The numerical results show that the two-tone driving widely employed is not enough to generate tripartite entanglement, while three- and four-tone driving can be employed to generate and enhance genuine tripartite entanglement. All bipartite entanglement can also be modulated. In addition, we demonstrate the monogamous relation of tripartite EPR steering and manipulate the asymmetry of steering. This work provides a method for manipulating the quantum correlation among multiple macroscopic objects.

We propose a hybrid quantum-classical algorithm to solve a dynamic asset allocation problem where a target return and a target risk metric (expected shortfall) are specified. We propose an iterative algorithm that treats the target return as a constraint in a Markowitz portfolio optimization model, and dynamically adjusts the target return to satisfy the targeted expected shortfall. The Markowitz optimization is formulated as a Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) problem. The use of the expected shortfall risk metric enables the modeling of extreme market events. We compare the results from D-Wave's 2000Q and Advantage quantum annealers using real-world financial data. Both quantum annealers are able to generate portfolios with more than 80% of the return of the classical optimal solutions, while satisfying the expected shortfall. We observe that experiments on assets with higher correlations tend to perform better, which may help to design practical quantum applications in the near term.

TI Thermodynamics of Quantum Trajectories on a Quantum Computer
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB Quantum computers have recently become available as noisy intermediate-scale quantum devices. Already these machines yield a useful environment for research on quantum systems and dynamics. Building on this opportunity, we investigate open-system dynamics that are simulated on a quantum computer by coupling a system of interest to an ancilla. After each interaction the ancilla is measured, and the sequence of measurements defines a quantum trajectory. Using a thermodynamic analogy, which identifies trajectories as microstates, we show how to bias the dynamics of the open system in order to enhance the probability of quantum trajectories with desired properties, e.g., particular measurement patterns or temporal correlations. We discuss how such a biased-generally non-Markovian-dynamics can be implemented on a unitary, gate-based quantum computer and show proof-of-principle results on the publicly accessible ibmq_jakarta machine. While our analysis is solely conducted on small systems, it highlights the challenges in controlling complex aspects of open-system dynamics on digital quantum computers.

TI Ecmas plus : Efficient Circuit Mapping and Scheduling for Surface Code
   Encoded Circuit on Quantum Cloud Platform
SO ACM TRANSACTIONS ON ARCHITECTURE AND CODE OPTIMIZATION
AB As the leading candidate for quantum error correction, the surface code faces substantial overhead, such as redundant physical qubits and prolonged execution time. Reducing the space-time cost of circuit execution can significantly improve the throughput of modern quantum cloud platforms. While utilizing more physical qubits can reduce execution time, different quantum circuits vary in their ability to leverage chip resources. Therefore, optimizing the compilation of surface code circuits on quantum chips becomes critical. In this work, we address the mapping and scheduling problem in compiling surface code to reduce the cost. First, we introduce a novel metric Circuit Parallelism Degree to characterize circuit properties in detail and select the most suitable chip from a list of available options. Next, we will quantitatively assess the resources to determine if they are sufficient for the circuit. We then propose a resource-adaptive mapping and scheduling method called Ecmas+, which customizes the initialization of chip resources for each circuit. Ecmas+ significantly reduces execution time in the double defect and lattice surgery models. Extensive numerical tests on practical datasets demonstrate that Ecmas+ outperforms state-of-the-art methods, reducing execution time by an average of 46% for the double defect model and 29.7% for the lattice surgery model.

TI Low-overhead non-Clifford fault-tolerant circuits for all non-chiral
   abelian topological phases
SO QUANTUM
AB We propose a family of explicit geometrically local circuits on a 2-dimensional planar grid of qudits, realizing any abelian non-chiral topological phase as an actively error-corrected fault-tolerant memory. These circuits are constructed from measuring 1-form symmetries in discrete fixed-point path integrals, which we express through cellular cohomology and higher-order cup products. The specific path integral we use is the abelian DijkgraafWitten state sum on a 3-dimensional cellulation, which is a spacetime representation of the twisted quantum double model. The resulting circuits are based on a syndrome extraction circuit of the (qudit) stabilizer toric code, into which we insert non- Clifford phase gates that implement the "twist". The overhead compared to the toric code is moderate, in contrast to known constructions for twisted abelian phases. The simplest non-trivial example is a fault-tolerant circuit for the double-semion phase, defined on the same set of qubits as the stabilizer toric code, with 12 controlled-S gates in addition to the 8 controlled-X gates and 2 single-qubit measurements of the toric code per spacetime unit cell. We also show that other architectures for the (qudit) toric code phase, like measurement-based topological quantum computation or Floquet codes, can be enriched with phase gates to implement twisted quantum doubles instead of their untwisted versions. As a further result, we prove fault tolerance under arbitrary local (including non-Pauli) noise for a very general class of topological circuits that we call 1-form symmetric fixed-point circuits. This notion unifies the circuits in this paper as well as the stabilizer toric code, subsystem toric code, measurement-based topological quantum computation, or the (CSS) honeycomb Floquet code. We also demonstrate how our method can be adapted to construct fault-tolerant circuits for specific non- Abelian phases. In the appendix we present an explicit combinatorial procedure to define formulas for higher cup products on arbitrary cellulations, which might be interesting in its own right to the TQFT and topological-phases community.

TI Performance analysis and evaluation of postquantum secure blockchained
   federated learning
SO COMPUTER NETWORKS
AB As the field of quantum computing progresses, traditional cryptographic algorithms such as RSA and ECDSA are becoming increasingly vulnerable to quantum-based attacks, underscoring the need for robust post-quantum security in critical systems like Federated Learning (FL) and Blockchain. In light of this, we propose a novel hybrid approach for blockchain-based FL (BFL) that integrates a stateless signature scheme, such as Dilithium or Falcon, with a stateful hash-based scheme like XMSS. This combination leverages the complementary strengths of both schemes to provide enhanced security. To further optimize performance, we introduce a linear formula- based device role selection method that takes into account key factors such as computational power and stake accumulation. This selection process is reinforced by a verifiable random function (VRF), which strengthens the blockchain consensus mechanism. Our extensive experimental results demonstrate that this hybrid approach significantly enhances both the security and efficiency of BFL systems, establishing a robust framework for the integration of post-quantum cryptography as we transition into the quantum computing era.

TI Multi-variable integration with a variational quantum circuit
SO QUANTUM SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB In this work we present a novel strategy to evaluate multi-variable integrals with quantum circuits. The procedure first encodes the integration variables into a parametric circuit. The obtained circuit is then derived with respect to the integration variables using the parameter shift rule technique. The observable representing the derivative is then used as the predictor of the target integrand function following a quantum machine learning approach. The integral is then estimated using the fundamental theorem of integral calculus by evaluating the original circuit. Embedding data according to a reuploading strategy, multi-dimensional variables can be easily encoded into the circuit's gates and then individually taken as targets while deriving the circuit. These techniques can be exploited to partially integrate a function or to quickly compute parametric integrands within the training hyperspace.

TI Mitigation of birefringence in cavity-based quantum networks using
   frequency-encoded photons
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Atom-cavity systems offer unique advantages for building large-scale distributed quantum computers by providing strong atom-photon coupling while allowing for high-fidelity local operations of atomic qubits. However, in prevalent schemes where the photonic state is encoded in polarization, cavity birefringence introduces an energy splitting of the cavity eigenmodes and alters the polarization states, thus limiting the fidelity of remote entanglement generation. To address this challenge, we propose a scheme that encodes the photonic qubit in the frequency degree of freedom. The scheme relies on resonant coupling of multiple transverse cavity modes to different atomic transitions that are well separated in frequency. We numerically investigate the temporal properties of the photonic wave packet, two-photon interference visibility, and atom-atom entanglement fidelity under various cavity polarization-mode splittings and find that our scheme is less affected by cavity birefringence. Finally, we propose practical implementations in two trapped ion systems, using the fine-structure splitting in the metastable D state of 40Ca+ and the hyperfine splitting in the ground state of 225Ra+. Our study presents an alternative approach for cavity-based quantum networks that is less sensitive to birefringent effects and is applicable to a variety of atomic and solid-state emitter-cavity interfaces.

TI Solvable Quantum Circuits in Tree+1 Dimensions
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB We devise tractable models of unitary quantum many-body dynamics on tree graphs, as a first step toward a deeper understanding of dynamics in non-Euclidean spaces. To this end, we first demonstrate how to construct strictly local quantum circuits that preserve the symmetries of trees, such that their dynamical light cones grow isotropically. For trees with coordination number z, such circuits can be built from z-site gates. We then introduce a family of gates for which the dynamics are exactly solvable; these satisfy a set of constraints that we term "tree-unitarity." Notably, tree-unitarity reduces to the previously established notion of dual-unitarity for z = 2, when the tree reduces to a line. Among the unexpected features of tree-unitarity is a trade-off between "maximum butterfly velocity" dynamics of out-of-time-order correlators and the existence of nonvanishing correlation functions in multiple directions, a tension absent in one-dimensional dual-unitary models and their Euclidean generalizations. We connect the existence of (a wide class of) solvable dynamics with nonmaximal butterfly velocity directly to a property of the underlying circuit geometry called delta-hyperbolicity, and argue that such dynamics can only arise in non-Euclidean geometries. We give various examples of tree-unitary gates, discuss dynamical correlations, out-of-time-order correlators, and entanglement growth, and show that the kicked Ising model on a tree is a physically motivated example of maximum-velocity tree-unitary dynamics.

TI Variational quantum circuit learning-enabled robust optimization for AI
   data center energy control and decarbonization
SO ADVANCES IN APPLIED ENERGY
AB As the demand for artificial intelligence (AI) models and applications continues to grow, data centers that handle AI workloads are experiencing a rise in energy consumption and associated carbon footprint. This work proposes a variational quantum computing-based robust optimization (VQC-RO) framework for control and energy management in large-scale data centers to address the computational challenges and overcome limitations of conventional model-based and model-free strategies. The VQC-RO framework integrates variational quantum circuits (VQCs) with classical optimization to enable efficient and uncertainty-aware control of energy systems in AI data centers. Quantum algorithms executed on noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices are used for value function estimation trained with Q-learning, leading to the formulation of a robust optimization problem with uncertain coefficients. The quantum computing-based robust control strategy is designed to address uncertainties associated with weather conditions and renewable energy generation while optimizing energy consumption in AI data centers. This work also outlines the computational experiments conducted at various AI data center locations in the United States to analyze the reduction in power consumption and carbon emission levels associated with the proposed quantum computing-based robust control framework. This work contributes a novel approach to energy-efficient and sustainable data center operation, promising to reduce carbon emissions and energy consumption in large-scale data centers handling AI workloads by 9.8 % and 12.5 %, respectively.

TI Testing the Conjecture That Quantum Processes Create Conscious
   Experience
SO ENTROPY
AB The question of what generates conscious experience has mesmerized thinkers since the dawn of humanity, yet its origins remain a mystery. The topic of consciousness has gained traction in recent years, thanks to the development of large language models that now arguably pass the Turing test, an operational test for intelligence. However, intelligence and consciousness are not related in obvious ways, as anyone who suffers from a bad toothache can attest-pain generates intense feelings and absorbs all our conscious awareness, yet nothing particularly intelligent is going on. In the hard sciences, this topic is frequently met with skepticism because, to date, no protocol to measure the content or intensity of conscious experiences in an observer-independent manner has been agreed upon. Here, we present a novel proposal: Conscious experience arises whenever a quantum mechanical superposition forms. Our proposal has several implications: First, it suggests that the structure of the superposition determines the qualia of the experience. Second, quantum entanglement naturally solves the binding problem, ensuring the unity of phenomenal experience. Finally, a moment of agency may coincide with the formation of a superposition state. We outline a research program to experimentally test our conjecture via a sequence of quantum biology experiments. Applying these ideas opens up the possibility of expanding human conscious experience through brain-quantum computer interfaces.

TI Distillation of Gaussian Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen steering with noiseless
   linear amplification
SO NPJ QUANTUM INFORMATION
AB Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR) steering is one of the most intriguing features of quantum mechanics and an important resource for quantum communication. For practical applications, it remains a challenge to protect EPR steering from decoherence due to its intrinsic difference from entanglement. Here, we experimentally demonstrate the distillation of Gaussian EPR steering and entanglement in lossy and noisy environments using measurement-based noiseless linear amplification. Different from entanglement distillation, the extension of steerable region happens in the distillation of EPR steering, besides the enhancement of steerabilities. We demonstrate that the two-way or one-way steerable region is extended after the distillation of EPR steering when the NLA is implemented based on Bob's or Alice's measurement results. We also show that the NLA helps to extract the secret key from the insecure region in one-sided device-independent quantum key distribution with EPR steering. Our work paves the way for quantum communication exploiting EPR steering in practical quantum channels.

TI Generalized Quantum Convolution for Multidimensional Data
SO ENTROPY
AB The convolution operation plays a vital role in a wide range of critical algorithms across various domains, such as digital image processing, convolutional neural networks, and quantum machine learning. In existing implementations, particularly in quantum neural networks, convolution operations are usually approximated by the application of filters with data strides that are equal to the filter window sizes. One challenge with these implementations is preserving the spatial and temporal localities of the input features, specifically for data with higher dimensions. In addition, the deep circuits required to perform quantum convolution with a unity stride, especially for multidimensional data, increase the risk of violating decoherence constraints. In this work, we propose depth-optimized circuits for performing generalized multidimensional quantum convolution operations with unity stride targeting applications that process data with high dimensions, such as hyperspectral imagery and remote sensing. We experimentally evaluate and demonstrate the applicability of the proposed techniques by using real-world, high-resolution, multidimensional image data on a state-of-the-art quantum simulator from IBM Quantum.

TI Noise-robust proofs of quantum network nonlocality
SO QUANTUM
AB Quantum networks allow for novel forms of quantum nonlocality. By exploiting the combination of entangled states and entangled measurements, strong nonlo cal correlations can be generated across the entire network. So far, all proofs of this effect are essentially restricted to the idealized case of pure entangled states and projective local measurements. Here we present noise-robust proofs of network quantum nonlocality, for a class of quantum distributions on the triangle network that are based on entangled states and entangled measurements. The key ingredient is a result of approximate rigidity for local distributions that satisfy the so-called "parity token counting" property with high probability. Our methods can be applied to any type of noise. As illustrative examples, we consider quantum distributions obtained with imperfect sources and obtain a noise robustness up to similar to 80% for dephasing noise and up to similar to 0.5% for white noise. Additionally, we prove that all distributions in the vicinity of some ideal quantum distribution are nonlo cal, with a bound on the opens interesting perspectives towards the work nonlocality.

TI Focus beyond Quadratic Speedups for Error-Corrected Quantum Advantage
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB In this perspective we discuss conditions under which it would be possible for a modest fault-tolerant quantum computer to realize a runtime advantage by executing a quantum algorithm with only a small polynomial speedup over the best classical alternative. The challenge is that the computation must finish within a reasonable amount of time while being difficult enough that the small quantum scaling advantage would compensate for the large constant factor overheads associated with error correction. We compute several examples of such runtimes using state-of-the-art surface code constructions under a variety of assumptions. We conclude that quadratic speedups will not enable quantum advantage on early generations of such fault-tolerant devices unless there is a significant improvement in how we realize quantum error correction. While this conclusion persists even if we were to increase the rate of logical gates in the surface code by more than an order of magnitude, we also repeat this analysis for speedups by other polynomial degrees and find that quartic speedups look significantly more practical.

TI Active control of single-photon spontaneous emission out-coupling
   enhancement by rotation modulation of hyperbolic metamaterials
SO ISCIENCE
AB Controlling the rate and direction of spontaneous emission is critical for quantum technologies such as single-photon sources and secure communications. We propose atunable nanophotonic device that modulates spontaneous emission by rotating the optical axis of a hyperbolic metamaterial (Au-SiO2) at room temperature. Analytical and numerical studies demonstrate that rotation alters the local density of states, enabling dynamic emission rate control without structural changes. The device's performance depends on the metal filling fraction, rotation angle, and wavelength, allowing spectral flexibility. As a proof of concept, we design a system that efficiently out-couples emission into a nano-waveguide. This approach provides a simple, geometry-independent method to switch emission on/off, advancing practical quantum photonic devices. The work opens avenues for applications in quantum optics, sensing, and on-chip quantum networks.

TI Factoring 2048-bit RSA Integers in 177 Days with 13 436 Qubits and a
   Multimode Memory
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB We analyze the performance of a quantum computer architecture combining a small processor and a storage unit. By focusing on integer factorization, we show a reduction by several orders of magnitude of the number of processing qubits compared with a standard architecture using a planar grid of qubits with nearest-neighbor connectivity. This is achieved by taking advantage of a temporally and spatially multiplexed memory to store the qubit states between processing steps. Concretely, for a characteristic physical gate error rate of 10(-3), a processor cycle time of 1 microsecond, factoring a 2 048-bit RSA integer is shown to be possible in 177 days with 3D gauge color codes assuming a threshold of 0.75% with a processor made with 13 436 physical qubits and a memory that can store 28 million spatial modes and 45 temporal modes with 2 hours' storage time. By inserting additional error-correction steps, storage times of 1 second are shown to be sufficient at the cost of increasing the run-time by about 23%. Shorter run-times (and storage times) are achievable by increasing the number of qubits in the processing unit. We suggest realizing such an architecture using a microwave interface between a processor made with superconducting qubits and a multiplexed memory using the principle of photon echo in solids doped with rare-earth ions.

TI Deterministic generation of two-dimensional multi-photon cluster states
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Multidimensional cluster states are a key resource for robust quantum communication, measurement-based quantum computing and quantum metrology. Here, we present a device capable of emitting large-scale entangled microwave photonic states in a two dimensional ladder structure. The device consists of a pair of coupled superconducting transmon qubits which are each tuneably coupled to a common output waveguide. This architecture permits entanglement between each transmon and a deterministically emitted photonic qubit. By interleaving two-qubit gates with controlled photon emission, we generate 2 x n grids of time- and frequency-multiplexed cluster states of itinerant microwave photons. We generate states with fidelities above 0.50 for up to eight qubits and, in addition, observe nonzero localizable entanglement for states of up to 16 qubits. We expect the device architecture to be capable of generating a wide range of other tensor network states such as tree graph states, repeater states or the ground state of the toric code, and to be readily scalable to generate larger and higher dimensional states.

TI High-speed calibration method for cascaded phase shifters in integrated
   quantum photonic chips
SO ACTA PHYSICA SINICA
AB Integrated photonics has the advantages of miniaturization, low cost, stability and easy manipulation in comparison with bulk optics. However, as the scale and complexity of the chip increase, the calibration of cascaded phase shifters on-chip will be almost impossible. The time needed to calibrate the cascaded phase shifters with using conventional method increases exponentially with the number of cascades, and the maximum number of cascades achieved so far is only 5. In this paper, we propose a high-speed calibration method by which the calibration time increases only linearly with the number of cascades increasing, achieving an exponential acceleration. For N-cascaded phase shifters, the number of points scanned by each shifter is m, our method only needs to scan (m(2)+m+1)N-1 points instead of mn with using the proposed method. The main idea of this method is that we can calibrate phase shifters one by one via two-dimensional (2D) scanning. For example, for N-cascaded phase shifter, the calibration of phase shifter N can be realized by calibrating the 2D scanning phase shifter N-1 and the 2D scanning phase shifter N, and the calibration of phase shifter N-1 can be achieved by calibrating the 2D scanning phase shifter N-2 and the 2D scanning phase shifter N-1, and so on. The 2D scanning phase shifter N-1 and the 2D scanning phase shifter N scan the phase shifter N by m points and then the current of phase shifter N-1 is changed to scan the phase shifter N. Whenever changing the current of phase shifter N-1 once, we can plot a curve of current-transmission. The lowest point of the curve changes with the change of the current phase shifter N-1. When the lowest point of the curve takes a maximum value, that point is the 0 or p phase of phase shifter N. Similarly, when the lowest point of the curve takes a maximum value, that point is the -0.5p or 0.5p phase of phase shifter N-1. Then we can calibrate all phase shifters by using this method, but each phase shifter has two possibilities. Then we can set a specific current of all phase shifters to finish the calibration. The different parameters are verified to see their effect on fidelity. It is found that small experimental error has little effect on fidelity. When m>20, the fidelity becomes approximately a constant. For every 1760 increase in N, the fidelity decreases by about 0.01%. The fidelity of 20-cascaded phase shifters is 99.8%. The splitting ratio of MMI may is not 50:50 as designed because of chip processing errors. So, different splitting ratios are simulated and it is found that the splitting ratio affects the fidelity more seriously than other parameters. But our method works still well even when the splitting ratio is 45:55, whose fidelity is 99.95% if we know the splitting ratio. The method will greatly expand the application scope of integrated quantum photonics.

TI Single trusted qubit is necessary and sufficient for quantum realization
   of extremal no-signaling correlations
SO NPJ QUANTUM INFORMATION
AB The problem of achieving security of device-independent (or semi-device-independent) cryptography (for quantum key distribution and randomness generation) against the most general no-signaling adversaries has remained open. It has been recognized that the realization of extremal no-signaling non-local boxes (or extremal no-signaling non-local assemblages) could provide a route toward devising such highly secure protocols. We first prove a general no-go result that in the Bell non-locality scenario, quantum theory does not allow us to realize any extremal no-signaling non-local box, even if scenarios of arbitrary sequential measurements are considered. On the other hand, we secondly prove a positive result showing that a one-sided device-independent scenario where a single party trusts their qubit system is already sufficient for quantum theory to realize a self-testing extremal non-local point within the set of no-signaling assemblages.

TI Three-Body Entanglement in Particle Decays
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB Quantum entanglement has long served as a foundational pillar in understanding quantum mechanics, with a predominant focus on two-particle systems. We extend the study of entanglement into the realm of three-body decays, offering a more intricate understanding of quantum correlations. We introduce a novel approach for three-particle systems by utilizing the principles of entanglement monotone concurrence and the monogamy property. Our findings highlight the potential of studying deviations from the standard model and emphasize its significance in particle phenomenology. This work paves the way for new insights into particle physics through multiparticle quantum entanglement, particularly in decays of heavy fermions and hadrons.

TI Quantum walk approach to simulating parton showers
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW D
AB This paper presents a novel quantum walk approach to simulating parton showers on a quantum computer. We demonstrate that the quantum walk paradigm offers a natural and more efficient approach to simulating parton showers on quantum devices, with the emission probabilities implemented as the coin flip for the walker, and the particle emissions to either gluons or quark pairs corresponding to the movement of the walker in two dimensions. A quantum algorithm is proposed for a simplified, toy model of a 31-step, collinear parton shower, hence significantly increasing the number of steps of the parton shower that can be simulated compared to previous quantum algorithms. Furthermore, it scales efficiently: the number of possible shower steps increases exponentially with the number of qubits, and the circuit depth grows linearly with the number of steps. Reframing the parton shower in the context of a quantum walk therefore brings dramatic improvements, and is a step towards extending the current quantum algorithms to simulate more realistic parton showers.

AB In this paper, we deal with quantum information decoding. Quantum codes are a known technique for correcting errors of quantum information caused by noise or operational errors and one of the most popular types of codes is the so-called stabilizer code. Various implementation methods have been proposed to encode information into a stabilizer code, but there have been few studies on decoding to extract the original information from the code words. In this paper, we propose a decoding method for stabilizer codes using dissipation dynamics and show that the original information can be extracted from the code words.

TI Benchmarking quantum logic operations relative to thresholds for fault
   tolerance
SO NPJ QUANTUM INFORMATION
AB Contemporary methods for benchmarking noisy quantum processors typically measure average error rates or process infidelities. However, thresholds for fault-tolerant quantum error correction are given in terms of worst-case error rates-defined via the diamond norm-which can differ from average error rates by orders of magnitude. One method for resolving this discrepancy is to randomize the physical implementation of quantum gates, using techniques like randomized compiling (RC). In this work, we use gate set tomography to perform precision characterization of a set of two-qubit logic gates to study RC on a superconducting quantum processor. We find that, under RC, gate errors are accurately described by a stochastic Pauli noise model without coherent errors, and that spatially correlated coherent errors and non-Markovian errors are strongly suppressed. We further show that the average and worst-case error rates are equal for randomly compiled gates, and measure a maximum worst-case error of 0.0197(3) for our gate set. Our results show that randomized benchmarks are a viable route to both verifying that a quantum processor's error rates are below a fault-tolerance threshold, and to bounding the failure rates of near-term algorithms, if-and only if-gates are implemented via randomization methods which tailor noise.

TI Demonstration of minisuperspace quantum cosmology using quantum
   computational algorithms on IBM quantum computer
SO QUANTUM INFORMATION PROCESSING
AB Quantum computers promise to efficiently solve important problems that are intractable on a conventional computer. Quantum computational algorithms have the potential to be an exciting new way of studying quantum cosmology. In quantum cosmology, we learn about the dynamics of the universe without constructing a complete theory of quantum gravity. Since the universal wavefunction exists in an infinite-dimensional superspace over all possible 3D metrics and modes of matter configurations, we take minisuperspaces for our work by constraining the degrees of freedom to particular 3D metrics and uniform scalar field configurations. Here, we consider a wide variety of cosmological models. We begin by analyzing an anisotropic universe with cosmological constant and classical radiation. We then study the results for higher derivatives, Kaluza-Klein theories and string dilaton in quantum cosmology. We use IBM's Quantum Information Science Kit (QISKit) python library and the Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) algorithm for studying these systems. The VQE algorithm is a hybrid algorithm that uses the variational approach and interleaves quantum and classical computations in order to find the minimum eigenvalue of the Hamiltonian for a given system. The minimum eigenvalue of the Hamiltonian obtained will serve as a boundary condition for the given wavefuntion.

TI Entanglement Routing and Bottlenecks in Grid Networks
SO ANNALEN DER PHYSIK
AB Distributing entangled states among users is a fundamental problem in quantum networks. Existing protocols like X$X$ protocol introduced in [npj Quantum Inf. 2019, 5, 76] use graph theoretic tools like local complementation to optimize the number of measurements required to extract any Bell pair among the network users. Such a protocol relies on finding the shortest path between the users. Here, it is established that, in general, the most optimal path to perform the X$X$ protocol is not along the shortest path. Specific examples of this advantage are provided on networks of size as small as 12 qubits. Bottlenecks in establishing simultaneous Bell pairs in nearest-neighbor architectures are also explored. Recent results suggesting the unsuitability of the line and ring networks for the implementation of quantum networks due to the bottlenecks are revisited, and using local equivalency relations from graph theory, it's hinted that even grid graphs are not exempted from bottleneck issues. Finally, bottlenecks are simulated in grid graphs of sizes up to 6x6$6 \times 6$. Analysis reveals relative positions within a grid graph that are more susceptible to bottlenecks. It demonstrates the superiority of the X$X$ protocol along paths that are not shortest paths while avoiding bottlenecks for simultaneous communication requests.

TI Thermometry based on a superconducting qubit
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW APPLIED
AB We report temperature measurements using a transmon qubit by detecting the population of its first three energy levels after applying a sequence of n pulses and performing projective dispersive readout. We measure the effective temperature of the qubit and characterize its relaxation and coherence times r1, r2 for three devices in the temperature range from 20 to 300 mK. We analyze the process of qubit thermalization to its effective environment consisting of multiple heat baths and support this with experimental data. The signal-to-noise ratio of the temperature measurement depends strongly on r1, which drops at higher temperatures due to quasiparticle excitations, adversely affecting the measurements and setting an upper bound of the dynamic temperature range of the thermometer. The measurement relies on coherent dynamics of the qubit during the n pulses. The effective qubit temperature follows closely that of the cryostat in the range from 100 to 200 mK. We present a numerical model of the qubit population distribution and find hat it compares favorably with the experimental results. Finally, we compare our technique with previous work on qubit thermometry and discuss its application prospects.

TI Quantum network communication resource optimization scheme based on
   multi-scale entanglement renormalization ansatz
SO ACTA PHYSICA SINICA
AB Quantum key distribution (QKD) is a pivotal technology in the field of secure communication by using the principles of quantum mechanics to implement theoretically unbreakable encryption. However, QKD faces significant challenges in achieving large-scale deployment. The primary hurdle lies in the scarcity of quantum resources, especially entangled photon pairs, which are fundamental to protocols such as Ekert91. In traditional QKD implementations, only a small potion of the generated entanglement pairs contribute to generating the original key, resulting in lower efficiency and resource waste. Resolving this limitation is crucial to the advancement and scalability of QKD networks. This paper introduces an innovative approach to QKD by integrating the multiscale entanglement renormalization ansatz (MERA), a technique which is originally developed for many-body quantum systems. By utilizing MERA's hierarchical structure, the proposed method not only improves the efficiency of entanglement distribution but also reduces the consumption of quantum resources. Specifically, MERA compresses many-body quantum states into lower-dimensional representations, allowing for the transmission and storage of entanglement in a more efficient manner. This compression significantly reduces the number of qubits required, optimizing both entanglement utilization and storage capacity in quantum networks. To evaluate the performance of this method, we conduct simulations under standardized conditions. In the simulation, a 1024-bit encryption request, an 8% error rate, an average path length of 4 hops in the quantum network, and a 95% success rate for link entanglement generation and entanglement swapping operations are assumed. These parameters reflect the real physical conditions in contemporary QKD networks. The results demonstrate that compared with traditional QKD protocols, the MERA-based approach saves 124151 entangled pairs, which is impressive. This significant reduction in resource consumption indicates the potential application of MERA in improving the efficiency of QKD systems without sacrificing security. Importantly, the security of the key exchange process remains intact, for the method inherently adheres to the principles of quantum mechanics, particularly the no-cloning theorem and the use of randomness in the decompression layer. Some conclusions can be drawn below. The MERA not only enhances the scalability of QKD by optimizing quantum resource allocation, but also maintains the necessary security guarantees for practical cryptographic

TI Quantum Private Comparison Protocol with Cluster States
SO AXIOMS
AB In this paper, we introduce a quantum private comparison (QPC) protocol designed for two players to securely and privately assess the equality of their private information. The protocol utilizes four-particle cluster states prepared by a semi-honest third party (TP), who strictly adheres to the protocol without deviation or collusion with any participant. The TP facilitates the private comparison by enabling users to encode their information through bit-flip or phase-shift operators applied to the received quantum sequences. Once the information is encoded, the sequences are returned to the TP, who can derive the comparison results without accessing any details of the private information. This design ensures correctness, privacy, and fairness throughout the process. The QPC protocol is robust against both external threats and participant attacks due to the incorporation of the decoy-state method and quantum key distribution techniques. Additionally, the protocol employs unitary operations and Bell-basis measurements, enhancing its technical feasibility for practical implementation. Notably, the proposed protocol achieves a qubit efficiency of up to 50%. This efficiency, combined with its strong security features, establishes the QPC protocol as a promising solution for private information comparisons within the realm of quantum cryptography.

AB In the field of data processing and IoT communication it is possible to develop more robust solutions by combining quantum algorithms with metaheuristics. Said solutions can be applied in the industry and be measured using metrics associated with complexity, efficiency, processing, and accuracy. An extensive bibliographical review is carried out to determine which is the most efficient and effective hybrid algorithm that can be applied to a real experimental case, which aims to improve communication to reduce occupational risks. Criteria, metrics, and experimental results were obtained, in which it is shown that the quantum genetic algorithm is better than the genetic algorithm. A detailed discussion on the objective function, the convergence to the global optimum, and the need to improve the obtained solutions is given. The conclusions raise new aspects that need investigation.

TI Waveguide integrated hot electron bolometer for classical and quantum
   photonics
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB The development of performant integrated detectors, which are sensitive to quantum fluctuations of coherent light, are strongly desired to realize a scalable and determinist photonic quantum processor based on continuous variables states of light. Here, we investigate the performance of hot electron bolometers (HEBs) fabricated on top of a silicon-on-insulator (SOI) photonic circuit showing responsivities up to 8600 V/W and a record noise equivalent temperature of 1.1 dB above the quantum limit. Thanks to a detailed analysis of the noise sources of the waveguide integrated HEB, we estimate 14.8 dBV clearance between the shot noise and electrical noise with just 1.1 mu W of local oscillator power. The full technology compatibility with superconducting nanowire single photon detectors (SNSPDs) opens the possibility of nonclassical state engineering and state tomography performed within the same platform, enabling a new class of optical quantum processors.

TI Low-depth quantum state preparation
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB A crucial subroutine in quantum computing is to load the classical data of N complex numbers into the amplitude of a superposed n = [log(2) N]-qubit state. It has been proven that any algorithm universally implementing this subroutine would need at least O(N) constant weight operations. However, the proof assumes that only n qubits are used, whereas the circuit depth could be reduced by extending the space and allowing ancillary qubits. Here we investigate this space-time tradeoff in quantum state preparation with classical data. We propose quantum algorithms with O(n(2)) circuit depth to encode any N complex numbers using only single-and two-qubit gates, and local measurements with ancillary qubits. Different variances of the algorithm are proposed with different space and runtime. In particular, we present a scheme with O(N-2) ancillary qubits, O(n(2)) circuit depth, and O(n(2)) average runtime, which exponentially improves the conventional bound. While the algorithm requires more ancillary qubits, it consists of quantum circuit blocks that only simultaneously act on a constant number of qubits, and at most O(n) qubits are entangled. We also prove a fundamental lower bound Omega(n) for the minimum circuit depth and runtime with an arbitrary number of ancillary qubits, aligning with our scheme with O(n(2)). The algorithms are expected to have wide applications in both near-term and universal quantum computing.

TI Color-Tunable Mixed-Cation Perovskite Single Photon Emitters
SO ACS PHOTONICS
AB Quantum photonics technologies, like wavelength division multiplexing (WDM), for high-rate quantum key distribution require narrowband, spectrally tunable single photon emitters. Physical methods that rely on the application of large mechanical strain to epitaxial quantum dots or electric and magnetic fields to color centers in 2D metal dichalcogenides provide limited spectral tunability. Here we adopt a chemical approach to synthesize a family of colloidal mixed-cation perovskite quantum dots (Cs1-xFAxPbBr3) that show highly photostable, compositionally tunable single photon emission at room temperature, spanning more than 30 nm in the visible wavelength spectral range. We find that tailoring the stoichiometry of the organic formamidinium (FA) cation in all-inorganic cesium lead bromide (CsPbBr3) perovskite quantum dots detunes the electronic band structure while preserving their excellent single photon emission character-istics. We argue that the mixed-cation perovskite quantum dots studied in this work offer a new platform for the realization of color-tunable single photon emitters that could be readily integrated in a diversity of quantum photonic devices.

TI Decoherence of a spin-valley qubit in a MoS2 quantum dot
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICS COMMUNICATIONS
AB Transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD)-based quantum dots (QDs) have proven to be a successful and promising device for physically implementing electron spin-valley based qubits. Although the electron spin in a TMDs monolayer semiconductor QD can be isolated and controlled with high precision, decoherence occurs due to unavoidable coupling with the surrounding environment, such as nuclear spin environments. In this paper, using an exact master equation (ME) of spin qubit dynamics coupled to a nuclear spin bath in terms of hyperfine interaction (HI), we have investigated the controllability of dynamics processes with varying degrees of non-Markovianity. In large magnetic fields, we show that pure spin or valley qubits can be created. We calculate the loss of fidelity due to the Overhauser field of HI in a wide range of nuclear spin N.

TI Deterministic Generation of Concatenated Graph Codes from Quantum
   Emitters
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB Photon loss is the dominant noise mechanism in photonic quantum technologies. Designing faulttolerant schemes with high tolerance to loss is thus a central challenge in scaling photonic quantum information processors. Concatenation of a fault-tolerant construction with a code able to efficiently correct loss is a promising approach to achieve this but practical ways to implement code concatenation with photons have been lacking. We propose schemes for generating concatenated graph codes using multiphoton emission from two quantum emitters or a single quantum emitter coupled to a memory-capabilities available in several photonic platforms. We show that these schemes enable fault-tolerant fusion-based quantum computation in practical regimes with high photon loss and standard fusion gates without the need for auxiliary photons.

TI Experimental decoy-state asymmetric measurement-device-independent
   quantum key distribution over a turbulent high-loss channel
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Real -world Bennett-Brassard 1984 quantum key distribution (QKD) systems utilize imperfect devices that introduce vulnerabilities to their security, known as side -channel attacks. Measurement-device-independent (MDI) QKD authorizes an untrusted third party to make measurements and removes all side -channel attacks. The typical implementations of MDI QKD employ nearly symmetric channels which are difficult to realize physically in many practical scenarios such as when asymmetric channel losses are present, normally a consequence of the communication environment. Maritime and satellite-based communications are two such instances in which the channels are characterized by continuously changing losses in different channels. In this work we perform asymmetric MDI QKD in a laboratory environment with simulated turbulence using an acousto-optic modulator to interrogate the performance of free-space quantum communication. Under turbulent conditions, scattering and beam wandering cause intensity fluctuations which decrease the detected signal-to-noise ratio. Using the seven-intensity optimization method proposed by Wang et al. [Phys. Rev. X 9, 041012 (2019)], coupled with prefixed-threshold real -time selection (PRTS), we demonstrate enhancement in the secure key rate under turbulent conditions for finite-size decoy-state MDI QKD. Furthermore, we show that PRTS can yield higher secure key rates, particularly in the high -loss regime.

TI 2xN twin-field quantum key distribution network configuration
   based on polarization, wavelength, and time division multiplexing
SO NPJ QUANTUM INFORMATION
AB Developing quantum key distribution (QKD) has been recently directed toward distance extension and network expansion for real-world secure communications. Considering a recent report on a quantum communication network over 4,600 km, it seems that QKD networks using conventional protocols have been sufficiently studied. However, although the twin-field QKD (TF-QKD) proposed for long-distance QKD has been studied deeply enough to succeed the demonstrations over 428- and 511-km deployed fibers, TF-QKD networks have been verified only for a ring network. In this work, we propose a star topological 2 x N TF-QKD network scheme, where the coherence maintenance issue, being the primary obstacle to implementing TF-QKD, can be minimized by the automatic mode-matching feature of the Sagnac-based plug-and-play architecture. A lower number of active controllers is required for our scheme in comparison with one-way TF-QKD networks. Moreover, our scheme adopts a cost-effective configuration that requires only a single pair of single-photon detectors for the entire network system. We conducted a proof-of-concept experiment over a 50-km fiber successfully, achieving an average secret key rate of 1.31 x 10(-4 )bit per pulse (1.52 bit per second) with the finite-size effect.

TI Enhanced tunable photon-pair generation from a nonlinear metasurface
   with a guided-mode cavity
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB The ability to generate quantum entangled photon pairs through spontaneous parametric down conversion (SPDC) is playing a pivotal role in many applications in quantum technologies, including quantum communications, quantum computation, and quantum imaging. Metasurfaces, two-dimensional arrays of nanostructures with subwavelength thickness, have recently shown extraordinary capability in manipulating classical and quantum states of light and realizing miniaturized SPDC sources. Whereas previous studies have primarily focused on periodic metasurfaces, we uncover the potential of spatially modulated nanopatterns for further SPDC enhancement and state engineering. Specifically, we propose a nonlinear metasurface featuring a lateral guided-mode cavity formed by two distributed Bragg reflectors. With the quasinormal mode theory, we predict an SPDC rate up to 157 Hz/mW, which represents about 30 times rate enhancement when compared to the metasurface without a cavity. Furthermore, the cavity supports a continuous set of high-Q resonances across a broad bandwidth, allowing the all-optical tuning of the photon-pair emission directions transverse to the cavity by controlling the pump wavelength, which can find applications in quantum imaging.

TI QKD-Enhanced Cybersecurity Protocols
SO IEEE PHOTONICS JOURNAL
AB Security of QKD is guaranteed by the quantum mechanics laws rather than unproven assumptions employed in computational cryptography. Unfortunately, the secret-key rates are way too low and transmission distances are limited. The post-quantum cryptography (PQC) is proposed as an alternative to QKD. However, the PQC protocols are based on conjecture that there are no polynomial time algorithms to break the PQC protocols. To overcome key challenges of both post-quantum cryptography and QKD, we propose to use the QKD only in initialization stage to set-up corresponding cybersecurity protocols. The proposed concept is applied to both computational security and PQC protocols. The proposed QKD-enhanced cybersecurity protocols are tolerant to attacks initiated by quantum computers.

TI Cavity-Mediated Entanglement of Parametrically Driven Spin Qubits via
   Sidebands
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB We consider a pair of quantum dot-based spin qubits that interact via microwave photons in a superconducting cavity and that are also parametrically driven by separate external electric fields. For this system, we formulate a model for spin qubit entanglement in the presence of mutually off-resonant qubit and cavity frequencies. We show that the sidebands generated via the driving fields enable highly tunable qubit-qubit entanglement using only ac control and without requiring the qubit and cavity frequencies to be tuned into simultaneous resonance. The model we derive can be mapped to a variety of qubit types, including detuning-driven one-electron spin qubits in double quantum dots and three-electron resonant exchange qubits in triple quantum dots. The high degree of nonlinearity inherent in spin qubits renders these systems particularly favorable for parametric drive-activated entanglement. We determine multiple common resonance conditions for the two driven qubits and the cavity and identify experimentally relevant parameter regimes that enable the implementation of entangling gates with suppressed sensitivity to cavity photon occupation and decay. The parametrically driven sideband resonance approach that we describe provides a promising route toward scalability and modularity in spin-based quantum information processing through drive-enabled tunability that can also be implemented in micromagnet-free electron and hole systems for spin -photon coupling.

AB Secure multiparty computation (SMC) provides collaboration among multiple parties, ensuring the confidentiality of their private information. However, classical SMC implementations encounter significant security and efficiency challenges. Resorting to the entangled Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) state, we propose a quantum-based two-party protocol to compute binary Boolean functions, with the help of a third party. We exploit a technique in which a random Z-phase rotation on the GHZ state is performed to achieve higher security. The security and complexity analyses demonstrate the feasibility and improved security of our scheme compared to other SMC Boolean function computation methods. Additionally, we implemented the proposed protocol on the IBM QisKit and found consistent outcomes that validate the protocol's correctness.

TI The limits of multiplexing quantum and classical channels: Case study of
   a 2.5 GHz discrete variable quantum key distribution system
SO APPLIED PHYSICS LETTERS
AB Network integration of quantum key distribution is crucial for its future widespread deployment due to the high cost of using optical fibers dedicated for the quantum channel only. We studied the performance of a system running a simplified BB84 protocol at 2.5 GHz repetition rate, operating in the original wavelength band, the short O-band, when multiplexed with communication channels in the conventional wavelength band, and the short C-band. Our system could successfully generate secret keys over a single-mode fiber with a length of 95.5 km and with co-propagating classical signals at a launch power of 8.9 dBm. Furthermore, we discuss the performance of an ideal system under the same conditions, showing the limits of what is possible with a discrete variable system in the O-band. We also considered a short and lossy link with 51 km optical fiber resembling a real link in a metropolitan area network. In this scenario, we could exchange a secret key with a launch power up to 16.7 dBm in the classical channels.

TI Ascertaining Susceptibilities in Smart Contracts: A Quantum Machine
   Learning Approach
SO ENTROPY
AB The current research aims to discover applications of QML approaches in realizing liabilities within smart contracts. These contracts are essential commodities of the blockchain interface and are also decisive in developing decentralized products. But liabilities in smart contracts could result in unfamiliar system failures. Presently, static detection tools are utilized to discover accountabilities. However, they could result in instances of false narratives due to their dependency on predefined rules. In addition, these policies can often be superseded, failing to generalize on new contracts. The detection of liabilities with ML approaches, correspondingly, has certain limitations with contract size due to storage and performance issues. Nevertheless, employing QML approaches could be beneficial as they do not necessitate any preconceived rules. They often learn from data attributes during the training process and are employed as alternatives to ML approaches in terms of storage and performance. The present study employs four QML approaches, namely, QNN, QSVM, VQC, and QRF, for discovering susceptibilities. Experimentation revealed that the QNN model surpasses other approaches in detecting liabilities, with a performance accuracy of 82.43%. To further validate its feasibility and performance, the model was assessed on a several-partition test dataset, i.e., SolidiFI data, and the outcomes remained consistent. Additionally, the performance of the model was statistically validated using McNemar's test.

SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICS A-MATHEMATICAL AND THEORETICAL
AB We present a diffeomorphism-invariant formulation of differential entropy for Riemannian spaces, providing a fine-grained, coordinate-independent notion of quantum information for continuous variables in physical space. To this end, we consider the generalization of the Wigner quasiprobability density function to arbitrary Riemannian manifolds and analytically continue Shannon's differential entropy to account for contributions from intermediate virtual quantum states. We illustrate the framework by computing the quantum phase-space entropy of harmonic oscillator energy eigenstates in both Minkowski and anti-de Sitter geometries. Furthermore, we derive a generalized entropic uncertainty relation, extending the Bialynicki-Birula and Mycielski inequality to curved backgrounds. By bridging concepts from information theory, differential geometry, and quantum physics, our work provides a systematic approach to studying continuous-variable quantum information in curved spaces.

TI Automated Detection of Alzheimer's via Hybrid Classical Quantum Neural
   Networks
SO ELECTRONICS
AB Deep Neural Networks have offered numerous innovative solutions to brain-related diseases including Alzheimer's. However, there are still a few standpoints in terms of diagnosis and planning that can be transformed via quantum Machine Learning (QML). In this study, we present a hybrid classical-quantum machine learning model for the detection of Alzheimer's using 6400 labeled MRI scans with two classes. Hybrid classical-quantum transfer learning is used, which makes it possible to optimally pre-process complex and high-dimensional data. Classical neural networks extract high-dimensional features and embed informative feature vectors into a quantum processor. We use resnet34 to extract features from the image and feed a 512-feature vector to our quantum variational circuit (QVC) to generate a four-feature vector for precise decision boundaries. Adam optimizer is used to exploit the adaptive learning rate corresponding to each parameter based on first- and second-order gradients. Furthermore, to validate the model, different quantum simulators (PennyLane, qiskit.aer and qiskit.basicaer) are used for the detection of the demented and non-demented images. The learning rate is set to 10(-4) for and optimized quantum depth of six layers, resulting in a training accuracy of 99.1% and a classification accuracy of 97.2% for 20 epochs. The hybrid classical-quantum network significantly outperformed the classical network, as the classification accuracy achieved by the classical transfer learning model was 92%. Thus, a hybrid transfer-learning model is used for binary detection, in which a quantum circuit improves the performance of a pre-trained ResNet34 architecture. Therefore, this work offers a method for selecting an optimal approach for detecting Alzheimer's disease. The proposed model not only allows for the automated detection of Alzheimer's but would also speed up the process significantly in clinical settings.

TI Quantum tomography of noisy ion-based qudits
SO LASER PHYSICS LETTERS
AB Quantum tomography makes it possible to obtain a comprehensive information about certain logical elements of a quantum computer. In this regard, it is a promising tool for debugging quantum computers. The practical application of tomography, however, is still limited by systematic measurement errors. Their main source are errors in the quantum state preparation and measurement procedures. In this work, we investigate the possibility of suppressing these errors in the case of trapped-ion-based qudits. First, we will show that one can construct a quantum tomography protocol that contains no more than a single quantum operation in each measurement circuit. Such a protocol is more robust to errors than the measurements in mutually unbiased bases, where the number of operations increases in proportion to the square of the qudit dimension. After that, we will demonstrate the possibility of determining and accounting for the state initialization and readout errors. Together, the measures described can significantly improve the accuracy of quantum tomography of real ion-based qudits.

TI ReQUSA: a novel ReRAM-based hardware accelerator architecture for
   high-speed quantum computer simulation
SO PHYSICA SCRIPTA
AB Quantum computers are currently regarded as an emerging computing technology that can solve problems more quickly than classical computers. However, since constructing a general quantum computer is technically difficult, quantum computer simulation has been used instead of real quantum computers. Simulating quantum computers on classical computers is challenging because the time and resources required for the vectormatrix multiplication (VMM) increase exponentially with the number of qubits. This paper proposes a new accelerator architecture called ReQUSA that leverages resistive random access memory (ReRAM) to accelerate the quantum computer simulation. The ReQUSA employs a ReRAM crossbar array structure, which is specialized for implementing the VMM, and a realized state method for reduced VMM operation. To the best of our knowledge, ReRAM-based accelerators for quantum computer simulators has not been previously reported. Here, we describe the hardware design of the architecture and compare the performances (hardware resource, simulation time, and accuracy) of our accelerator with those of current quantum computer simulators (QuEST, QPlayer, and Qiskit). On average, our proposed architecture reduced the simulation times by factors of x104 and x103 (x102) on average from those of QuEST and QPlayer (also Qiskit), respectively. In addition, our architecture achieved 99% accuracy in 16-bit fixed-point data representation.

TI Dynamic graph-based quantum feature selection for accurate fetal plane
   classification in ultrasound imaging
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB Accurate classification of fetal biometric planes in ultrasound imaging is more important for effective prenatal screening and early diagnosis of fetal abnormalities. To enhance the diagnostic efficiency, the research proposed a novel method called "Dynamic Graph-Based Quantum Feature Selection" (DG-QFS) framework to improve the classification performance by integrating the quantum computing principles. Features are extracted from ultrasound images using a pre-trained deep learning model and processed through a quantum-driven feature selection pipeline that models the inter-feature relationships using dynamically entangled multi-qubit graphs. In the DG-QFS method, qubits represent extracted deep feature nodes, while a quantum entanglement score-based dynamic graph captures the complex dependencies. Entanglement score and dynamic graph centrality are used to select the most informative features. The refined feature set is classified using a lightweight multi-layer perceptron (MLP), stochastic gradient descent with adaptive learning rate. Examined the proposed model on a fetal plane ultrasound scan dataset, including 12,400 images of six categorical planes, such as brain, thorax, abdomen, femur, maternal cervix, and other views. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed model achieves a classification accuracy of 96.73%, significantly outperforming baseline deep learning and conventional feature selection techniques regarding accuracy, generalization, and interpretability.

TI In situ Tuning of the Electric-Dipole Strength of a Double-Dot Charge
   Qubit: Charge-Noise Protection and Ultrastrong Coupling
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW X
AB Semiconductor quantum dots in which electrons or holes are isolated via electrostatic potentials generated by surface gates are promising building blocks for semiconductor-based quantum technology. Here, we investigate double-quantum-dot (DQD) charge qubits in GaAs capacitively coupled to highimpedance superconducting quantum interference device array and Josephson-junction array resonators. We tune the strength of the electric-dipole interaction between the qubit and the resonator in situ using surface gates. We characterize the qubit-resonator coupling strength, the qubit decoherence, and the detuning noise affecting the charge qubit for different electrostatic DQD configurations. We find all quantities to be systematically tunable over more than one order of magnitude, resulting in reproducible decoherence rates ??2/2?? < 5 MHz in the limit of high interdot capacitance. In the opposite limit, by reducing the interdot capacitance, we increase the DQD electric-dipole strength and, therefore, its coupling to the resonator. Employing a Josephson-junction array resonator with an impedance of approximately 4 k?? and a resonance frequency of ??r/2?? ??? 5.6 GHz, we observe a coupling strength of g/2?? ??? 630 MHz, demonstrating the possibility to operate electrons hosted in a semiconductor DQD in the ultrastrong-coupling regime (USC). The presented results are essential for further increasing the coherence of quantum-dot-based qubits and investigating USC physics in semiconducting QDs.

TI Error-Detected State Transfer and Entanglement in a Superconducting
   Quantum Network
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB Microwave photons are used to wire up modular quantum processors, but mitigating the effects of loss between modules remains a crucial challenge. We use a low-loss bus resonator to couple bosonic qubits across a superconducting network with protocols made robust to photon loss in the bus. We transfer a multiphoton qubit and track loss events, improving the fidelity to the break-even point with respect to the best uncorrectable encoding. We also demonstrate a entanglement protocol using Hong-Ou-Mandel interference and error detection to prepare a two-photon Bell state with fidelity 94% and success probability 0.79, halving the error obtained with a single photon. This network link also presents new opportunities for resource-efficient direct gates between modules.

TI Photon quantum entanglement in the MeV regime and its application in PET
   imaging
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Positron Emission Tomography (PET) is a widely-used imaging modality for medical research and clinical diagnosis. Imaging of the radiotracer is obtained from the detected hit positions of the two positron annihilation photons in a detector array. The image is degraded by backgrounds from random coincidences and in-patient scatter events which require correction. In addition to the geometric information, the two annihilation photons are predicted to be produced in a quantum-entangled state, resulting in enhanced correlations between their subsequent interaction processes. To explore this, the predicted entanglement in linear polarisation for the two photons was incorporated into a simulation and tested by comparison with experimental data from a cadmium zinc telluride (CZT) PET demonstrator apparatus. Adapted apparati also enabled correlation measurements where one of the photons had undergone a prior scatter process. We show that the entangled simulation describes the measured correlations and, through simulation of a larger preclinical PET scanner, illustrate a simple method to quantify and remove the unwanted backgrounds in PET using the quantum entanglement information alone. Gamma photons used in positron emission tomography are predicted to be produced in an entangled state. Here, the authors simulate the effects of entanglement and test them through comparison with experimental data from a PET demonstrator apparatus, showing the potential gains in background suppression.

TI Optimal two-qubit gates in recurrence protocols of entanglement
   purification
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB We propose and investigate a method to optimize recurrence entanglement purification protocols. The approach is based on a numerical search in the whole set of SU(4) matrices with the aid of a quasi-Newton algorithm. Our method evaluates average concurrences where the probabilistic occurrence of mixed entangled states is also taken into account. We show for certain families of states that optimal protocols are not necessarily achieved by bilaterally applied controlled-NOT gates. As we discover several optimal solutions, the proposed method offers some flexibility in experimental implementations of entanglement purification protocols and interesting perspectives in quantum information processing.

TI Tsirelson bounds for quantum correlations with indefinite causal order
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Quantum theory is in principle compatible with processes that violate causal inequalities, an analogue of Bell inequalities that constrain the correlations observed by sets of parties operating in a definite causal order. Since the introduction of causal inequalities, determining their maximum quantum violation, analogue to Tsirelson's bound for Bell inequalities, has remained an open problem. Here we provide a general method for bounding the violation of arbitrary causal inequalities, establishing limits to the correlations achievable by arbitrary local experiments and by arbitrary quantum processes with indefinite causal order. We prove that the maximum violation is generally smaller than the algebraic maximum of the corresponding correlation, and determine Tsirelson-like bounds for a class of causal inequalities including some of the most paradigmatic examples. Our results motivate a search for physical principles characterizing the boundary of the set of quantum correlations with indefinite causal order.

TI Spectral Addressability in a Modular Two Qubit System
SO JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN CHEMICAL SOCIETY
AB The combination of structural precision and reproducibility of synthetic chemistry is perfectly suited for the creation of chemical qubits, the core units of a quantum information science (QIS) system. By exploiting the atomistic control inherent to synthetic chemistry, we address a fundamental question of how the spin-spin distance between two qubits impacts electronic spin coherence. To achieve this goal, we designed a series of molecules featuring two spectrally distinct qubits, an early transition metal, Ti3+, and a late transition metal, Cu2+ with increasing separation between the two metals. Crucially, we also synthesized the monometallic congeners to serve as controls. The spectral separation between the two metals enables us to probe each metal individually in the bimetallic species and compare it with the monometallic control samples. Across a range of 1.2-2.5 nm, we find that electron spins have a negligible effect on coherence times, a finding we attribute to the distinct resonance frequencies. Coherence times are governed, instead, by the distance to nuclear spins on the other qubit's ligand framework. This finding offers guidance for the design of spectrally addressable molecular qubits.

TI Multispin Clifford codes for angular momentum errors in spin systems
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB The physical symmetries of a system play a central role in quantum error correction. In this work we encode a qubit in a collection of systems with angular momentum symmetry (spins), extending the tools developed by Gross [J. A. Gross, Phys. Rev. Lett. 127, 010504 (2021)] for single large spins. By considering large spins present in atomic systems and focusing on their collective symmetric subspace, we develop codes with octahedral symmetry capable of correcting errors up to second order in angular momentum operators. These errors include the most physically relevant noise sources such as microwave control errors and optical pumping. We additionally explore qubit codes that exhibit distance scaling commensurate with the surface code while permitting transversal single-qubit Clifford operations.

TI Advanced architectures for high-performance quantum networking
SO JOURNAL OF OPTICAL COMMUNICATIONS AND NETWORKING
AB As practical quantum networks prepare to serve an ever-expanding number of nodes, there has grown a need for advanced auxiliary classical systems that support the quantum protocols and maintain compatibility with the existing fiber-optic infrastructure. We propose and demonstrate a quantum local area network design that addresses current deployment limitations in timing and security in a scalable fashion using commercial off-theshelf components. First, we employ White Rabbit switches to synchronize three remote nodes with ultra-low timing jitter, significantly increasing the fidelities of the distributed entangled states over previous work with Global Positioning System clocks. Second, using a parallel quantum key distribution channel, we secure the classical communications needed for instrument control and data management. In this way, the conventional network that manages our entanglement network is secured using keys generated via an underlying quantum key distribution layer, preserving the integrity of the supporting systems and the relevant data in a future-proof fashion.

TI The Quest for Cognition in Purposive Action: From Cybernetics to Quantum
   Computing
SO JOURNAL OF INTEGRATIVE NEUROSCIENCE
AB Norbert Wiener and Nikolai Bernstein set the stage for a worldwide multidisciplinary attempt to understand how purposive action is integrated with cognition in a circular, bidirectional manner, both in life sciences and engineering. Such a 'workshop' is still open and far away from a satisfactory level of understanding, despite the current hype surrounding Artificial Intelligence (AI). The problem is that Cognition is frequently confused with Intelligence, overlooking a crucial distinction: the type of cognition that is required of a cognitive agent to meet the challenge of adaptive behavior in a changing environment is Embodied Cognition, which is antithetical to the disembodied and dualistic nature of the current wave of AI. This essay is the perspective formulation of a cybernetic framework for the representation of actions that, following Bernstein, is focused on what has long been considered the fundamental issue under-lying action and motor control, namely the degrees of freedom problem. In particular, the paper reviews a solution to this problem based on a model of ideomotor/muscle-less synergy formation, namely the Passive Motion Paradigm (PMP). Moreover, it is shown how this modeling approach can be reformulated in a distributed manner based on a self-organizing neural paradigm consisting of multiple topology-representing networks with attractor dynamics. The computational implication of such an approach is also briefly analyzed looking at possible alternatives of the von Neuman paradigm, namely neuromorphic and quantum computing, aiming in perspective at a hybrid computational framework for integrating digital information, analog information, and quantum information. It is also suggested that such a framework is crucial not only for the neurobiological modeling of motor cognition but also for the design of the cognitive architecture of autonomous robots of industry 4.0 that are supposed to interact and communicate naturally with human partners.

TI Test Case Minimization with Quantum Annealers
SO ACM TRANSACTIONS ON SOFTWARE ENGINEERING AND METHODOLOGY
AB Quantum annealers are specialized quantum computers for solving combinatorial optimization problems with special quantum computing characteristics, e.g., superposition and entanglement. Theoretically, quantum annealers can outperform classic computers. However, current quantum annealers are constrained by a limited number of qubits and cannot demonstrate quantum advantages. Nonetheless, research is needed to develop novel mechanisms to formulate combinatorial optimization problems for quantum annealing (QA). However, QA applications in software engineering remain unexplored. Thus, we propose BootQA, the very first effort at solving test case minimization (TCM) problems on classical software with QA. We provide a novel TCM formulation for QA and utilize bootstrap sampling to optimize the qubit usage. We also implemented our TCM formulation in three other optimization processes: simulated annealing (SA), QA without problem decomposition, and QA with an existing D-Wave problem decomposition strategy, and conducted an empirical evaluation with three real-world TCM datasets. Results show that BootQA outperforms QA without problem decomposition and QA with the existing decomposition strategy regarding effectiveness. Moreover, BootQA's effectiveness is similar to SA. Finally, BootQA has higher efficiency in terms of time when solving large TCM problems than the other three optimization processes.

TI Ideal refocusing of an optically active spin qubit under strong
   hyperfine interactions
SO NATURE NANOTECHNOLOGY
AB Combining highly coherent spin control with efficient light-matter coupling offers great opportunities for quantum communication and computing. Optically active semiconductor quantum dots have unparalleled photonic properties but also modest spin coherence limited by their resident nuclei. The nuclear inhomogeneity has thus far bound all dynamical decoupling measurements to a few microseconds. Here, we eliminate this inhomogeneity using lattice-matched GaAs-AlGaAs quantum dot devices and demonstrate dynamical decoupling of the electron spin qubit beyond 0.113(3) ms. Leveraging the 99.30(5)% visibility of our optical pi-pulse gates, we use up to N-pi = 81 decoupling pulses and find a coherence time scaling of N-pi(0.75(2)) . This scaling manifests an ideal refocusing of strong interactions between the electron and the nuclear spin ensemble, free of extrinsic noise, which holds the promise of lifetime-limited spin coherence. Our findings demonstrate that the most punishing material science challenge for such quantum dot devices has a remedy and constitute the basis for highly coherent spin-photon interfaces.

TI A Privacy Preserving Authentication Protocol Using Quantum Computing for
   V2I Authentication in Vehicular Ad Hoc Networks
SO SECURITY AND COMMUNICATION NETWORKS
AB Many cryptographic techniques have been proposed to conceive a secure and privacy-oriented vehicular ad hoc network (VANET) for its practical deployment. The security of these techniques requires a common secret key to be shared between the communicating entities or depend upon the premise that some mathematical problems are computationally hard. However, because of the open nature of the wireless medium, the communication cannot be kept confidential and is prone to eavesdropping. Furthermore, with the arrival of quantum computers, these techniques are prone to quantum attacks-the time complexity of the assumed hard problem gets reduced from millions of years to a few seconds. In this paper, we propose a conditional privacy-preserving authentication scheme based on a quantum key distribution protocol for vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) communication. Our scheme inherits the properties of the quantum key distribution protocol. It does not require a secret authentication key to be transmitted conventionally and is resistant to quantum attacks. Apart from protecting VANETs against generic security threats, including node impersonation, message tampering, and repudiation, our scheme defends VANETs against man-in-the-middle attacks, replay attacks, etc. Besides, our protocol ensures message unlinkability, vehicle-identity privacy, and vehicle traceability if a vehicle misbehaves. The results obtained from the performance evaluation of our scheme confirm reasonable values of information leakage, key length, bit error probability, etc.

TI Large-scale Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger states through a topologically
   protected zero-energy mode in a superconducting qutrit-resonator chain
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB We propose a superconducting qutrit-resonator chain model, and analytically work out forms of its topological edge states. The existence of the zero-energy mode enables one to generate a state transfer between two ends of the chain, accompanied with state flips of all intermediate qutrits, based on which N-body Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) states can be generated with great robustness against disorders of coupling strengths. Three schemes of generating large-scale GHZ states are designed, each of which possesses the robustness against loss of qutrits or of resonators, meeting a certain performance requirement of different experimental devices. With experimentally feasible qutrit-resonator coupling strengths and available coherence times of qutrits and resonators, it has a potential to generate large-scale GHZ states among dozens of qutrits with a high fidelity. Further, we show the experimental consideration of generating GHZ states based on the circuit QED system, and discuss the prospect of realizing fast GHZ states.

TI Dephasing and error dynamics affecting a singlet-triplet qubit during
   coherent spin shuttling
SO NPJ QUANTUM INFORMATION
AB Quantum information transport over micron to millimeter scale distances is critical for the operation of practical quantum processors based on spin qubits. One method of achieving a long-range interaction is by coherent electron spin shuttling through an array of silicon quantum dots. In order to execute many shuttling operations with high fidelity, it is essential to understand the dynamics of qubit dephasing and relaxation during the shuttling process in order to mitigate them. However, errors arising after many repeated shuttles are not yet well documented. Here, we probe decay dynamics contributing to dephasing and relaxation of a singlet-triplet qubit during coherent spin shuttling over many N repeated shuttle operations, in a small external magnetic field B-0 approximate to 0-10 mT, and in the absence of a micromagnet. We find that losses are dominated by magnetic dephasing, most visible for small N < 10(3). However, incoherent spin-flip type shuttle errors become evident for large N > 10(3). Additionally, we estimate shuttle error rates below 10(-4) out to at least N = 10(3), representing an encouraging figure for future implementations of spin shuttling to entangle distant qubits.

TI Nanoscale Waveguide Beam Splitter in Quantum Technologies
SO NANOMATERIALS
AB Usually in quantum optics, the theory of large- and small-scale waveguide beam splitters is the same. In this paper, it is shown that the theory of the nanoscale waveguide beamsplitter has a significant difference from a similar device, but of a larger scale. It is shown that the previously known theory of the waveguide beam splitter is a particular case of the theory presented here. The wave function at the output ports of the nanoscale beam splitter is analyzed. The results obtained are sensitive to the size of the beam splitter, the coupling parameter of the two waveguides, and the degree of nonmonochromaticity of the photons entering the first and second ports of the beam splitter. The results are important for quantum technologies using a nanosized beam splitter.

TI Quantum-classical hybrid information processing via a single quantum
   system
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Current quantum technologies bring a new integration of quantum data with classical data for hybrid processing. However, the frameworks of these technologies are restricted to a single classical or quantum task, which limits their flexibility in near-term applications. We propose a quantum reservoir processor to harness quantum dynamics in computational tasks requiring both classical and quantum inputs. This analog processor comprises a quantum network in which quantum data are incident to the network and classical data are encoded via a coherent field exciting the network. We perform a multitasking application of quantum tomography and nonlinear equalization of classical channels. Interestingly, the tomography can be performed in a closed-loop manner via the feedback control of classical data. Therefore, if the classical input comes from a dynamical system, embedding this system in a closed loop enables hybrid processing even if access to the external classical input is interrupted. Finally, we demonstrate preparing quantum depolarizing channels as a quantum machine learning technique for quantum data processing.

SO SCIENCE CHINA-PHYSICS MECHANICS & ASTRONOMY
AB Constructing large-scale quantum resources is an important foundation for further improving the efficiency and scalability of quantum communication. Here, we present an efficient extraction and stable control scheme of 40 pairs of entangled sideband modes from the squeezed light by specially designing an optical parametric oscillator. Utilizing the low-loss optical frequency comb control technology and the local cross-correlation algorithm, we model and manage the efficient separation process of the entangled sideband modes facilitated by the optical filtering cavities, and a maximum entanglement level of 6.5 dB is achieved. The feasibility of large-capacity quantum dense coding based on these entangled sideband modes is proved experimentally, which is of great significance for optimizing the utilization of quantum resources, thereby contributing to the advancement of large- capacity quantum communication networks and enabling the realization of more secure and efficient quantum communication systems.

TI Evaluation of Quantum Annealer Performance via the Massive MIMO Problem
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB Quantum annealing offers an appealing route to handle large-scale optimization problems. Existing Quantum Annealing processing units are readily available via cloud platform access for solving Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) problems. In particular, the novel D-Wave Advantage device has been recently released. Its performance is expected to improve upon the previous state-of-the-art D-Wave 2000Q annealer, due to higher number of qubits and the Pegasus topology. Here, we present a comparative study via an ensemble of Maximum Likelihood (ML) Channel Decoder problems for MIMO scenarios in Centralized Radio Access Network (C-RAN) architectures. The main challenge for exact optimization of ML decoders with ever-increasing demand for higher data rates is the exponential increase of the solution space with problem sizes. Since current 5G solutions mainly use approximate methodologies, Kim et al. leveraged Quantum Annealing for large MIMO problems with Phase Shift Keying and Quadrature Amplitude Modulation scenarios. Here, we extend their work and analyze experiments for more complex modulations and larger MIMO antenna array sizes. By implementing the extended QUBO formulae on the novel annealer architecture, we uncover the limits of state-of-the-art quantum optimization for the massive MIMO ML decoder. We report on the improvements and discuss the uncovered limiting factors learned from the 64-QAM extension. We include the enhanced evaluation of raw annealer sampling via implementation of post-processing methods in the comparative analysis between D-Wave 2000Q and the D-Wave Advantage system.

TI Pairwise classification using quantum support vector machine with
   Kronecker kernel
SO QUANTUM MACHINE INTELLIGENCE
AB We investigated the potential application of quantum computing using the Kronecker kernel to pairwise classification and have devised a way to apply the Harrow-Hassidim-Lloyd (HHL)-based quantum support vector machine algorithm. Pairwise classification can be used to predict relationships among data and is used for problems such as link prediction and chemical interaction prediction. However, in pairwise classification using a Kronecker kernel, it is very costly to calculate the Kronecker product of the kernel matrices when there is a large amount of data. We found that the Kronecker product of kernel matrices can be represented more efficiently in time and space in quantum computing than that in classical computing. We also found that a pairwise classifier can be effectively trained by applying the HHL-based quantum support vector machine algorithm to the Kronecker kernel matrix. In an experiment comparing a classical algorithm with a quantum support vector machine with a Kronecker kernel run on a quantum computing simulator, the misclassification rate of the latter was almost the same as that of the former for the same pairwise classification problem in some cases. This indicates that a quantum support vector machine with a Kronecker kernel algorithm can achieve accuracy equivalent to that of the classical algorithm more efficiently and scalably. This finding paves the way for applying quantum machine learning to predicting relationships in large-scale data.

TI Detection of single ions in a nanoparticle coupled to a fiber cavity
SO OPTICA
AB Many quantum information protocols require the storage and manipulation of information over long times, and its exchange between nodes of a quantum network across long distances. Implementing these protocols requires an advanced quantum hardware, featuring, for example, a register of long-lived and interacting qubits with an efficient optical interface in the telecommunication band. Here we present the Purcell-enhanced detection of single solid-state ions in erbium-doped nanoparticles placed in a fiber cavity, emitting photons at 1536 nm. The open-access design of the cavity allows for complete tunability in both space and frequency, selecting individual particles and ions. The ions are confined in a volume two orders of magnitude smaller than in previous realizations, increasing the probability of finding ions separated by only a few nanometers, which could then interact. We report the detection of individual spectral features presenting saturation of the emission count rate and linewidth, as expected for two-level systems. We also report an uncorrected g((2)) (0) of 0.24(5) for the emitted field, confirming the presence of a single emitter. Our fully fiber-integrated system is an important step towards the realization of the initially envisioned quantum hardware.

TI Encoding of linear kinetic plasma problems in quantum circuits via data
   compression
SO JOURNAL OF PLASMA PHYSICS
AB We propose an algorithm for encoding linear kinetic plasma problems in quantum circuits. The focus is on modelling electrostatic linear waves in a one-dimensional Maxwellian electron plasma. The waves are described by the linearized Vlasov-Amp & egrave;re system with a spatially localized external current that drives plasma oscillations. This system is formulated as a boundary-value problem and cast in the form of a linear vector equation $\boldsymbol {A}{\boldsymbol{\psi} } = \boldsymbol {b}$ to be solved by using the quantum signal processing algorithm. The latter requires encoding of matrix $\boldsymbol {A}$ in a quantum circuit as a sub-block of a unitary matrix. We propose how to encode $\boldsymbol {A}$ in a circuit in a compressed form and discuss how the resulting circuit scales with the problem size and the desired precision.

TI Post-Quantum enhanced Ascon for secure vehicular IoT data integrity
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB Secure vehicular communication is important in sustaining secure and effective transportation infrastructures. Advances in the Vehicular Internet of Things (VIoT) technology enable communication among vehicles as well as roadside facilities, offering effective traffic flow and security control. However, the vehicular networks are exposed to increased risks from cyberattacks, particularly from incoming quantum computers with the ability to interpret out-of-date conventional codes. This paper proposes a security solution based on post-quantum cryptography (PQC), which enhances Ascon encryption by adding quantum-proof key exchange. This method ensures secure authentication and protects against replay, sybil, collision, phishing, and man-in-the-middle attacks. A 32-bit Ascon hash coupled with SHA-512 provides data integrity. Investigations on resource-constrained vehicular environments confirm that the new scheme provides better performance, producing 128-512-bit keys in microseconds, much quicker than Kyber and Falcon. It also outperforms Ascon in hash rendering speed, completing a 256 x 256 grayscale image in 0.0782s, compared to 0.822s for standard Ascon, thereby emphasizing its ability to provide secure, immediate communication between vehicles in scenarios sensitive to quantum technologies. These observations show that the suggested approach is strongly secure and computationally efficient, and hence it is suitable for protecting future connected and autonomous vehicles from cyberattacks in the quantum era.

TI Unified light-matter Floquet theory and its application to quantum
   communication
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Periodically driven quantum systems can exhibit a plethora of intriguing nonequilibrium phenomena that can be analyzed using Floquet theory. Naturally, Floquet theory is employed to describe the dynamics of atoms interacting with intense laser fields. However, this semiclassical analysis cannot account for quantum -optical phenomena that rely on the quantized nature of light. In this paper, we take a significant step to go beyond the semiclassical description of atom -photon coupled systems by unifying Floquet theory with quantum optics using the framework of full -counting statistics. This is achieved by introducing counting fields that keep track of the photonic dynamics. This formalism, which we dub "photon -resolved Floquet theory" (PRFT), is based on two -point tomographic measurements, instead of the two -point projective measurements used in standard full -counting statistics. Strikingly, the PRFT predicts the generation of macroscopic light -matter entanglement when atoms interact with multimode electromagnetic fields, thereby leading to complete decoherence of the atomic subsystem in the basis of the Floquet states. This decoherence occurs rapidly in the optical -frequency regime, but is negligible in the radio -frequency regime. Our results thus pave the way for the design of efficient quantum memories and quantum operations. Finally, employing the PRFT, we propose a quantumcommunication protocol that can significantly outperform the state -of -art few -photon protocols by two orders of magnitude or better. The PRFT potentially leads to insights in various Floquet settings including spectroscopy, thermodynamics, quantum metrology, and quantum simulations.

TI Adaptive Syndrome Extraction
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB Device error rates on current quantum computers have improved enough to where demonstrations of error correction below break even are now possible. Still, the circuits required for quantum error correction introduce significant overhead and sometimes inject more errors than they correct. In this work, we introduce adaptive syndrome extraction as a scheme to improve code performance and reduce the quantum error-correction cycle time by measuring only the stabilizer generators that are likely to provide useful syndrome information. We provide a concrete example of the scheme through the [[4,2,2]] code concatenated with a hypergraph product code and a syndrome-extraction cycle that uses quantum error detection to modify the syndrome-extraction circuits in real time. Compared to nonconcatenated codes and nonadaptive syndrome extraction, we find that the adaptive scheme achieves over an order of magnitude lower logical error rates while requiring fewer CNOT gates and physical qubits. Furthermore, we show how to achieve fault-tolerant universal logical computation with [[4,2,2]]-concatenated hypergraph product codes.

TI Bayesian Quantum Neural Networks
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB The astounding acceleration in Artificial Intelligence and Quantum Computing advances naturally gives rise to a line of research, which unrolls the potential advantages of quantum computing on classical Machine Learning tasks, known as Quantum Machine Learning or Quantum Machine Intelligence. The typical objectives are either (1) exploring the potential quantum advantages on classical learning tasks or (2) levering well-established classical ML algorithms to tackle quantum-related problems on Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) devices. Along the second research direction, we study Quantum Neural Networks (QNNs) to accomplish the purpose of Bayesian learning. By observing a wide range of studies on QNNs, in which the sole training method is based on frequentist training, we find that Bayesian learning benefits QNNs from two aspects. First, Bayesian-trained models enjoy a high level of generalization due to the prior and posterior distribution usage compared to frequentist training, which will be justified by this paper's theoretical study of model capacity. Second, Bayesian Inference offers epistemic uncertainty estimation, which merits the decision-making process. It is worth mentioning that frequentist-trained QNNs generally lack this desirable property. Under the Bayesian training procedure, our derived models can be considered a new class of QNNs (called BayesianQNNs) which possesses both desirable properties of Bayesian Inference while maintaining comparable predictive performance as frequentist counterparts. The proposed Bayesian Quantum Neural Networks is justified by empirical evidence from numerical experiments.

TI Distance Bounds for Generalized Bicycle Codes
SO SYMMETRY-BASEL
AB Generalized bicycle (GB) codes is a class of quantum error-correcting codes constructed from a pair of binary circulant matrices. Unlike for other simple quantum code ansatze, unrestricted GB codes may have linear distance scaling. In addition, low-density parity-check GB codes have a naturally overcomplete set of low-weight stabilizer generators, which is expected to improve their performance in the presence of syndrome measurement errors. For such GB codes with a given maximum generator weight w, we constructed upper distance bounds by mapping them to codes local in D <= w-1 dimensions, and lower existence bounds which give d >= O(n(1/2)). We have also conducted an exhaustive enumeration of GB codes for certain prime circulant sizes in a family of two-qubit encoding codes with row weights 4, 6, and 8; the observed distance scaling is consistent with A(w)n(1/2)+B(w), where n is the code length and A(w) is increasing with w.

TI Using Machine Learning for Quantum Annealing Accuracy Prediction
SO ALGORITHMS
AB Quantum annealers, such as the device built by D-Wave Systems, Inc., offer a way to compute solutions of NP-hard problems that can be expressed in Ising or quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO) form. Although such solutions are typically of very high quality, problem instances are usually not solved to optimality due to imperfections of the current generations quantum annealers. In this contribution, we aim to understand some of the factors contributing to the hardness of a problem instance, and to use machine learning models to predict the accuracy of the D-Wave 2000Q annealer for solving specific problems. We focus on the maximum clique problem, a classic NP-hard problem with important applications in network analysis, bioinformatics, and computational chemistry. By training a machine learning classification model on basic problem characteristics such as the number of edges in the graph, or annealing parameters, such as the D-Wave's chain strength, we are able to rank certain features in the order of their contribution to the solution hardness, and present a simple decision tree which allows to predict whether a problem will be solvable to optimality with the D-Wave 2000Q. We extend these results by training a machine learning regression model that predicts the clique size found by D-Wave.

TI Photocounting statistics of superconducting nanowire single-photon
   detectors
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Superconducting nanowire single-photon detectors (SNSPDs) are efficient measurement devices used for counting single photons. The field of their applications covers experimental quantum-optical studies, optical quantum computing, quantum communication, and others. After registering a photon by such a detector, the next one cannot be registered during the dead time, and after that this ability is smoothly restored. We have included this feature into the photodetection theory and introduced the corresponding photocounting formula. In the regime of continuous-wave detection, the photocounting statistics nonlinearly depends on the density operator due to a memory effect of previous measurement time windows. The considered examples demonstrate the strong influence of the relaxation process and the memory effect on the resulting photocounting statistics of the SNSPDs.

TI Challenges and opportunities in the supervised learning of quantum
   circuit expectation values
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW E
AB Recently, deep neural networks have been proven capable of predicting output expectation values of certain random quantum circuits via a supervised learning approach. Here we investigate the potential of this possible approach to the emulation of quantum circuits, testing both its limitations and the successful applications where it might outperform conventional direct simulation methods. The testbeds we consider are circuits often employed in variational quantum algorithms, featuring layers of CNOT gates alternated with single-qubit random rotations. On the one hand, we find that the computational cost of supervised learning scales exponentially with the interlayer variance of the random angles. This allows for entering a promising regime for quantum advantage, where quantum computers could easily outperform classical neural networks. On the other hand, circuits featuring only interqubit angle variations are easily emulated. In fact, thanks to a suitable scalable design, the trained networks accurately predict the expectation values of larger and deeper circuits than those used for training, even reaching circuit sizes, which, as we numerically show, are computationally intractable for the most common simulation libraries of state-vector and tensor-network algorithms. A repository of test data in the intractable regime is provided. We also analyze the most common metrics for the entanglement content, the expressibility, and the classical computational cost of quantum circuits, finding that they do not distinguish the easy from the hard circuit configurations.

TI Towards the Quantum Internet: Satellite Control Plane Architectures and
   Protocol Design
SO FUTURE INTERNET
AB The creation of the future quantum Internet requires the development of new systems, architectures, and communications protocols. As a matter of fact, the optical fiber technology is affected by extremely high losses; thus, the deployment of a quantum satellite network (QSN) composed of quantum satellite repeaters (QSRs) in low Earth orbit would make it possible to overcome these attenuation problems. For these reasons, we consider the design of an ad hoc quantum satellite backbone based on the Software-Defined Networking (SDN) paradigm with a modular two-tier Control Plane (CP). The first tier of the CP is embedded into a Master Control Station (MCS) on the ground, which coordinates the entire constellation and performs the management of the CP integrated into the constellation itself. This second tier is responsible for entanglement generation and management on the selected path. In addition to defining the SDN architecture in all its components, we present a possible protocol to generate entanglement on the end-to-end (E2E) path. Furthermore, we evaluate the performance of the developed protocol in terms of the latency required to establish entanglement between two ground stations connected via the quantum satellite backbone.

TI Widefield Diamond Quantum Sensing with Neuromorphic Vision Sensors
SO ADVANCED SCIENCE
AB Despite increasing interest in developing ultrasensitive widefield diamond magnetometry for various applications, achieving high temporal resolution and sensitivity simultaneously remains a key challenge. This is largely due to the transfer and processing of massive amounts of data from the frame-based sensor to capture the widefield fluorescence intensity of spin defects in diamonds. In this study, a neuromorphic vision sensor to encode the changes of fluorescence intensity into spikes in the optically detected magnetic resonance (ODMR) measurements is adopted, closely resembling the operation of the human vision system, which leads to highly compressed data volume and reduced latency. It also results in a vast dynamic range, high temporal resolution, and exceptional signal-to-background ratio. After a thorough theoretical evaluation, the experiment with an off-the-shelf event camera demonstrated a 13x improvement in temporal resolution with comparable precision of detecting ODMR resonance frequencies compared with the state-of-the-art highly specialized frame-based approach. It is successfully deploy this technology in monitoring dynamically modulated laser heating of gold nanoparticles coated on a diamond surface, a recognizably difficult task using existing approaches. The current development provides new insights for high-precision and low-latency widefield quantum sensing, with possibilities for integration with emerging memory devices to realize more intelligent quantum sensors.
   A high-precision and low-latency widefield diamond quantum sensing method has been demonstrated by utilizing a neuromorphic vision sensor (here an event camera). The resonance frequency of the optical detection magnetic resonance can be extracted from the reconstructed raw event data, leading to 13x improvement in temporal resolution and similar precision in comparison with frame-based camera.image

AB The integration of Quantum Computing into Echo State Networks (ESN) materializes in the form of the Quantum Echo State Network (QESN), a methodological innovation that reshapes predictive analytics within the domain of artificial intelligence. This investigation harnesses the novel QESN model alongside traditional ESNs, deploying them within the dynamic and burgeoning financial market of Africa. Our focus zeroes in on the Google Stock Price dataset, which provides a rich tapestry of regional financial activity. The QESN model distinguishes itself by a complex interconnection of qubits that conduct quantum operations, offering a marked amplification of computational capability. The empirical analysis reveals that the QESN model's predictive prowess substantially exceeds that of its ESN counterpart, achieving an unprecedentedly low Mean Squared Error (MSE) of 0.00021 in forecasting market trends. This exceptional figure redefines the standards of financial prediction models in African markets and establishes the QESN as an instrumental breakthrough, providing unparalleled accuracy in the analysis and prediction of financial data.

Moreover, we make comparisons of the above quantum key distribution protocols between using heralded single-photon source and using weak coherent sources, and analyze their advantages and disadvantages. Besides, according to the characteristics of single-photon interference in twin-field quantum key distributions, the limitations of separately applying heralded single-photon sources to twin-field quantum key distributions are revealed, and possible solutions are discussed. Therefore, this work may provide valuable references and help for the practical implementation of quantum secure communication in the near future.

We present first quantum simulations based on the variational quantum eigensolver for the low-lying structure of the C-12 nucleus that provide acceptable bound-state energies even in the presence of noise. We achieve this by taking advantage of two critical developments. First, we utilize an almost perfect symmetry of atomic nuclei that, in a complete symmetry-adapted basis, drastically reduces the size of the model space. Second, we use the efficacious Gray encoding, for which it has been recently shown that it is resource efficient, especially when coupled with a near band-diagonal structure of the nuclear Hamiltonian.

TI Coupled cluster method tailored with quantum computing
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Introducing an active space approximation is inevitable for the quantum computations of chemical systems. However, this approximation ignores the electron correlations related to nonactive orbitals. Here, we propose a computational method for correcting quantum computing results using a well-established classical theory called coupled cluster theory. Our approach efficiently extracts the quantum state from a quantum device by computational basis tomography. The extracted expansion coefficients of the quantum state are embedded into the coupled cluster ansatz within the framework of the tailored coupled cluster method. We demonstrate the performance of our method by verifying the potential energy curves of LiH, H2O, and N2 with a correlation-energy correction scheme. Our method demonstrates reasonable potential energy curves even when the standard coupled cluster fails. The sufficient numbers of measurements for tomography were also investigated. Furthermore, this method successfully estimated the activation energy of the Cope rearrangement reaction of 1,5-hexadiene together with perturbative triples correction. These demonstrations suggest that our approach has the potential for practical quantum chemical calculations using quantum computers.

TI Integrating magnons for quantum information
SO APPLIED PHYSICS LETTERS
AB Magnons, the quanta of collective spin excitations in magnetically ordered materials, have distinct properties that make them uniquely appealing for quantum information applications. They can have ultra-small wavelengths down to the nanometer scale even at microwave frequencies. They can provide coupling to a diverse set of other quantum excitations, and their inherently gyrotropic dynamics forms the basis for pronounced nonreciprocities. In this article, we discuss what the current research challenges are for integrating magnetic materials into quantum information systems and provide a perspective on how to address them.

TI Narain CFTs from nonbinary stabilizer codes
SO JOURNAL OF HIGH ENERGY PHYSICS
AB We generalize the construction of Narain conformal field theories (CFTs) from qudit stabilizer codes to the construction from quantum stabilizer codes over the finite field of prime power order (F-pm with p prime and m >= 1) or over the ring Z(k) with k > 1. Our construction results in rational CFTs, which cover a larger set of points in the moduli space of Narain CFTs than the previous one. We also propose a correspondence between a quantum stabilizer code with non-zero logical qubits and a finite set of Narain CFTs. We illustrate the correspondence with well-known stabilizer codes.

TI Tighter Constraints of Multipartite Systems in terms of General Quantum
   Correlations
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF THEORETICAL PHYSICS
AB Monogamy and polygamy relations characterize the quantum correlation distributions among multipartite quantum systems. We investigate the monogamy and polygamy relations satisfied by measures of general quantum correlation. By using the Hamming weight, we derive new monogamy and polygamy inequalities satisfied by the beta-th power and the alpha-th power of general quantum correlations, respectively. We show that these monogamy and polygamy relations are tighter than the existing ones, such as Liu [Int. J. Theor. Phys. 60, 1455-1470 (2021)]. Taking concurrence and the Tsallis-q entanglement of assistance as examples, we show the advantages of our results.

TI Evaluation of conventional and quantum computing for predicting
   mortality based on small early-onset colorectal cancer data
SO APPLIED SOFT COMPUTING
AB Background: Quantum computing integrated with machine learning (ML) offers novel solutions in various fields, including healthcare. The synergy between quantum computing and ML in classification exploits unique data patterns. Despite theoretical advantages, the empirical application and effectiveness of quantum computing on small medical datasets remains underexplored. Method: This retrospective study from a tertiary hospital used data on early-onset colorectal cancer with 93 features and 1501 patients from 2008 to 2020 to predict mortality. We compared quantum support vector machine (QSVM) models with classical SVM models in terms of number of features, number of training sets, and outcome ratio. We evaluated the model based on the area under the curve in the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC). Results: We observed a mortality rate of 7.6 % (96 of 1253 subjects). We generated the mortality prediction model using 11 clinical variables, including cancer stage and chemotherapy history. We found that the AUROC difference between the conventional and quantum methods was the maximum for the top 11 variables. We also showed the AUROC in QSVM (mean [standard deviation], 0.863 [0.102]) outperformed all the number of trials in the conventional SVM (0.723 [0.231]). Compared to the conventional SVM, the QSVM showed robust performance, consistent with the AUROC, even in the unbalanced case. Conclusion: Our study highlights the potential of quantum computing to improve predictive modeling in healthcare, especially for rare diseases with limited available data. The advantages of quantum computing, such as the exploration of Hilbert space, contributed to the superior predictive performance compared to conventional methods.

TI Solving the Sampling Problem of the Sycamore Quantum Circuits
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB We study the problem of generating independent samples from the output distribution of Google's Sycamore quantum circuits with a target fidelity, which is believed to be beyond the reach of classical supercomputers and has been used to demonstrate quantum supremacy. We propose a method to classically solve this problem by contracting the corresponding tensor network just once, and is massively more efficient than existing methods in generating a large number of uncorrelated samples with a target fidelity. For the Sycamore quantum supremacy circuit with 53 qubits and 20 cycles, we have generated 1 x 10(6) uncorrelated bitstrings s which are sampled from a distribution (P) over cap (s) = vertical bar(psi) over cap (s)vertical bar(2), where the approximate state (psi) over cap has fidelity F approximate to 0.0037. The whole computation has cost about 15 h on a computational cluster with 512 GPUs. The obtained 1 x 10(6) samples, the contraction code and contraction order are made public. If our algorithm could be implemented with high efficiency on a modern supercomputer with ExaFLOPS performance, we estimate that ideally, the simulation would cost a few dozens of seconds, which is faster than Google's quantum hardware.

TI Exploring thermal equilibria of the Fermi-Hubbard model with variational
   quantum algorithms
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB This study investigates the thermal properties of the repulsive Fermi-Hubbard model with chemical potential using variational quantum algorithms, crucial in comprehending particle behavior within lattices at high temperatures in condensed matter systems. Conventional computational methods encounter challenges, especially in managing chemical potential, prompting exploration into Hamiltonian approaches. Despite the promise of quantum algorithms, their efficacy is hampered by coherence limitations when simulating extended imaginary time evolution sequences. To overcome such constraints, this research focuses on optimizing variational quantum algorithms to probe the thermal properties of the Fermi-Hubbard model. Physics-inspired circuit designs are tailored to alleviate coherence constraints, facilitating a more comprehensive exploration of materials at elevated temperatures. Our study demonstrates the potential of variational algorithms in simulating the thermal properties of the Fermi-Hubbard model while acknowledging limitations stemming from error sources in quantum devices and encountering barren plateaus.

TI Neutral atoms in optical tweezers as messenger qubits for scaling up a
   trapped ion quantum computer
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB We propose to combine neutral atom and trapped ion qubits in one scalable modular architecture that uses shuttling of individual neutral atoms in optical tweezers to realize atomic interconnects between trapped ion quantum registers. These interconnects are deterministic, and thus may be performed on-demand. The proposed protocol is as follows: A tweezer-trapped neutral atom qubit is brought close to a trapped ion in an ion chain serving as a module of a larger quantum computer, and an entangling gate is performed between the two qubits. Then, the neutral atom is quickly moved to another, nearby trapped ion chain in the same modular ion trap and entangled with an ion in that chain, thus entangling the two separate ion chains. The optical dipole potential of the tweezer beam for the neutral atom does not measurably affect the trapped ions, while the rf ion trap does not affect the neutral atom. With realistic tweezer trap parameters, the neutral atom can be moved over millimeter-scale distance in a few tens of microseconds, thus enabling a remote entanglement generation rate of over 103 s-1even with very modest assumptions for the atom-ion quantum gate speed, and possibly up to 104 s-1, which is two orders of magnitude higher than the current state-of-the-art with photonic interconnects.

TI Critical non-Hermitian topology induced quantum sensing
SO NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB Non-Hermitian (NH) physics predicts open quantum system dynamics with unique topological features such as exceptional points and the NH skin effect. We show that this new paradigm of topological systems can serve as probes for bulk Hamiltonian parameters with quantum-enhanced sensitivity reaching Heisenberg scaling. Such enhancement occurs close to a spectral topological phase transition, where the entire spectrum undergoes a delocalization transition. We provide an explanation for this enhanced sensitivity based on the closing of point gap, which is a genuinely NH energy gap with no Hermitian counterpart. This establishes a direct connection between energy-gap closing and quantum enhancement in the NH realm. Our findings are demonstrated through several paradigmatic NH topological models in various dimensions and potential experimental implementations.

TI Quantum correlations in dissipative gain-loss systems across exceptional
   points
SO EUROPEAN PHYSICAL JOURNAL-SPECIAL TOPICS
AB We investigate the behavior of correlations dynamics in a dissipative gain-loss system. First, we consider a setup made of two coupled lossy oscillators, with one of them subject to a local gain. This provides a more realistic platform to implement parity-time (PT) symmetry circumventing the implementation of a pure gain. We show how the qualitative dynamics of correlations resembles that for a pure gain-loss setup. The major quantitative effect is that quantum correlations are reduced, while total ones are enhanced. Second, we study the behavior of these correlations across an exceptional point (EP) outside of the PT symmetric regime of parameters, observing how different behaviors across the EP occur only in the transient dynamics. This shows how PT symmetry plays a relevant role at large times.

AB It has been long known that quantum computing has the potential to revolutionize the way we find solutions of problems that are difficult to solve on classical computers. It was only recently that small but functional quantum computers have become available on the cloud, allowing to test their potential. In this paper we propose to leverage their capabilities to address an important task for recommender systems providers, the optimal selection of recommendation carousels. In many video-on-demand and music streaming services the user is provided with a homepage containing several recommendation lists, i.e., carousels, each built with a certain criteria (e.g., artist, mood, Action movies etc.). Choosing which set of carousels to display is a difficult problem because it needs to account for how the different recommendation lists interact, e.g., avoiding duplicate recommendations, and how they help the user explore the catalogue. We focus in particular on the adiabatic computing paradigm and use the D-Wave quantum annealer, which is able to solve NP-hard optimization problems, can be programmed by classical operations research tools and is freely available on the cloud. We propose a formulation of the carousel selection problem for black box recommenders, that can be solved effectively on a quantum annealer and has the advantage of being simple. We discuss its effectiveness, limitations and possible future directions of development.

In this work we present one of the first implementations of several Clifford data regression (CDR) based methods which are used to mitigate the effect of noise in real quantum data. We explore the dynamics of the 1D Ising model with transverse and longitudinal magnetic fields, highlighting signatures of confinement. We find in general CDR based techniques are advantageous in comparison with zero-noise extrapolation and obtain quantitative agreement with exact results for systems of nine qubits with circuit depths of up to 176, involving hundreds of CNOT gates. This is the largest systems investigated so far in a study of this type. We also investigate the two-point correlation function and find the effect of noise on this more complicated observable can be mitigated using Clifford quantum circuit data highlighting the utility of these methods.

The constructed coherent states are obtained by using an alterationof the Holstein-Primakoff realization (HPR) for DSUA. A general method to resolve of the problem of the unitary operator was developed for these kinds of quantum states. The Mandel parameter is considered to examine the statistical properties of PA-DPCSs. Furthermore, we offer a physical method to generate the PA-DPCSs in the framework of interaction among fields and atoms. Finally, we introduce the concept of entangled states for PA-DPCSs and examine the entanglement properties for entangled PA-DPCSs.

TI The RydbergGPT
SO MACHINE LEARNING-SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB We introduce a generative pretrained transformer (GPT) designed to learn the measurement outcomes of a neutral atom array quantum computer. Based on a vanilla transformer, our encoder-decoder architecture takes as input the interacting Hamiltonian, and outputs an autoregressive sequence of qubit measurement probabilities. Its performance is studied in the vicinity of a quantum phase transition in Rydberg atoms in a square lattice array. We explore the model's generalization capabilities by demonstrating that it can accurately predict ground-state measurement outcomes for Hamiltonian parameter values that were not included in the training data. We evaluate three model variants, each trained for a fixed duration on a single NVIDIA A100 GPU, by examining their predictions of key physical observables. These results establish performance benchmarks for scaling to larger RydbergGPT models. These can act as benchmarks for the scaling of larger RydbergGPT models in the future. Finally, we release RydbergGPT as open-source software to facilitate the development of foundation models for diverse quantum computing platforms and datasets.

Furthermore, we illustrate how the elastic effects may lead to the formation of ion conducting channels in the doped solid electrolyte Li 7 La 3 Zr 2 O 12 (LLZO). Apart from bulk elastic and chemical effect we demonstrate how to include interfacial effects into the quantum annealing approach and emphasize the importance of high precision elastic calculations.

TI Loophole-free plug-and-play quantum key distribution
SO NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB Robust, simple, and flexible quantum key distribution (QKD) is vital for realizing practical applications of this technique. Contrary to typical phase-coded QKD schemes, the plug-and-play QKD design requires only one arm-length-insensitive interferometer without active feedback, in which the noise is automatically compensated by the two-way structure. However, there are certain possible loopholes in the typical plug-and-play designs, which require consideration and strict monitoring. This study proposes a new design of theoretically loophole-free plug-and-play QKD scheme with two-way protocol and presents an experimental demonstration of said scheme. The security is analyzed under a collective attack scenario assisted by the decoy state method. The scheme was implemented in a 50.4 km commercial fibre without active feedback. The system showed highly robust performance with an ultra-low error rate and maintained an ultra-high visibility of 0.9947 +/- 0.0002 through significant environmental changes over 24 hours.

TI Bell-state generation for spin qubits via dissipative coupling
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
AB We theoretically investigate the dynamics of two spin qubits interacting with a magnetic medium. A systematic formal framework for this qubit-magnet hybrid system is developed in terms of the steady-state properties of the magnetic medium. Focusing on the induced dissipative coupling between the spin qubits, we show how a sizable long-lived entanglement can be established via the magnetic environment, in the absence of any coherent coupling. Moreover, we demonstrate that maximally entangled two-qubit states (Bell states) can be achieved in this scheme when complemented by proper postselection. In this situation, the time evolution of the entanglement is governed by a non-Hermitian Hamiltonian, where dynamical phases are separated by an exceptional point. The resultant Bell state is robust against weak random perturbations and does not require the preparation of a particular initial state. Our study may find applications in quantum information science, quantum spintronics, and for sensing of nonlocal quantum correlations.

TI Quantum algorithm for the radiative-transfer equation
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW APPLIED
AB The radiation transfer equation is widely used for simulations, for example, heat transfer in engineering, diffuse optical tomography in healthcare, and radiation hydrodynamics in astrophysics. By combining the lattice Boltzmann method, we propose a quantum algorithm for radiative transfer. This algorithm encompasses all the essential physical processes of radiative transfer: absorption, scattering, and emission. Although a sufficient number of measurements are required to precisely estimate the quantum state, and the initial encoding of the quantum state remains a challenging problem, our quantum algorithm exponentially accelerates radiative -transfer calculations compared to classical algorithms. In order to verify the quantum algorithm, we perform quantum circuit simulation using IBM Qiskit Aer and find good agreement between our numerical result and the exact solution. The algorithm paves the way for applications, such as fault -tolerant quantum computers for plasma engineering, telecommunications, nuclear -fusion technology, healthcare, and astrophysics.

TI Certifying measurement incompatibility in prepare-and-measure and Bell
   scenarios
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICS A-MATHEMATICAL AND THEORETICAL
AB We consider the problem of certifying measurement incompatibility in a prepare-and-measure (PM) scenario. We present different families of sets of qubit measurements which are incompatible, but cannot lead to any quantum over classical advantage in PM scenarios. Our examples are obtained via a general theorem which proves a set of qubit dichotomic measurements can have their incompatibility certified in a PM scenario if and only if their incompatibility can be certified in a bipartite Bell scenario where the parties share a maximally entangled state. Our framework naturally suggests a hierarchy of increasingly stronger notions of incompatibility, in which more power is given to the classical simulation by increasing its dimensionality. For qubits, we give an example of measurements whose incompatibility can be certified against trit simulations, which we show is the strongest possible notion for qubits in this framework.

TI Investigation of oxygen-vacancy complexes in diamond by means of ab
   initio calculations
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICS-CONDENSED MATTER
AB Point defects in diamond may act as quantum bits. Recently, oxygen-vacancy related defects have been proposed to the origin of the so-called ST1 color center in diamond that can realize a long-living solid-state quantum memory. Motivated by this proposal we systematically investigate oxygen-vacancy complexes in diamond by means of first principles density functional theory calculations. We find that all the considered oxygen-vacancy defects have a high-spin ground state in their neutral charge state, which disregards them as an origin for the ST1 color center. We identify a high-spin metastable oxygen-vacancy complex and characterize their magneto-optical properties for identification in future experiments.

TI QSegRNN: quantum segment recurrent neural network for time series
   forecasting
SO EPJ QUANTUM TECHNOLOGY
AB Recently many data centers have been constructed for artificial intelligence (AI) research. The important condition of the data center is to supply sufficient electricity, resulting in many electricity transformers being installed. Especially, these electricity transformers have led to significant heat generation in many data centers. Therefore, managing the temperature of electricity transformers has emerged as an important task. Notably, numerous studies are being conducted to manage and forecast the temperature of electricity transformers using artificial intelligence models. However, as the size of predictive models increases and computational demands grow, substantial computing resources are required. Consequently, there are instances where the lack of computing resources makes these models difficult to operate. To address these challenges, we propose a quantum segment recurrent neural network (QSegRNN), a time series forecasting model utilizing quantum computing. QSegRNN leverages quantum computing to achieve comparable performance with fewer parameters than classical counterpart models under similar conditions. QSegRNN inspired by a classical SegRNN uses the quantum cell instead of the classical cell in the model. The advantage of this structure is that it can be designed with fewer parameters under similar architecture. To construct the quantum cell, we benchmark the quantum convolutional circuit with amplitude embedding as the variational quantum circuit, minimizing information loss while considering the limit of noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices. The experiment result illustrates that the forecasting performance of QSegRNN achieves better performance than SegRNN and other forecasting models even though QSegRNN has only 85 percent of the parameters.

TI Device-independent certification of multipartite distillable
   entanglement
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Quantum networks consist of various quantum technologies, spread across vast distances, and involve various users at the same time. Certifying the functioning and efficiency of the individual components is a task that is well studied and widely used. However, the power of quantum networks can only be realized by integrating all the required quantum technologies and platforms across a large number of users. In this work, we demonstrate how to certify the distillable entanglement available in multipartite states produced by quantum networks, without relying on the physical realization of its constituent components. We do so by using the paradigm of device independence.

TI Sharing nonlocality in a quantum network by unbounded sequential
   observers
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Of late, there has been an upsurge of interest in studying the sequential sharing of various forms of quantum correlations, viz., nonlocality, preparation contextuality, coherence, and entanglement. In this work, we explore the sequential sharing of nonlocality in a quantum network. We first consider the simplest case of the two-input bilocality scenario that features two independent sources and three parties, including two edge parties and a central party. We demonstrate that, in the symmetric case when the sharing is considered for both the edge parties, the nonlocality can be shared by, at most, two sequential observers per edge party. However, in the asymmetric case, when the sharing across one edge party is considered, we show that, at most, six sequential observers can share the nonlocality in the network. We extend our investigation to the two-input n-local scenario in the star-network configuration that features an arbitrary n number of edge parties and one central party. In the asymmetric case, we demonstrate that the network nonlocality can be shared by an unbounded number of sequential observers across one edge party for a suitably large value of n. Further, we generalize our study for an arbitrary m input n-local scenario in the star-network configuration. We show that, even for an arbitrary m input scenario, the nonlocality can be shared by an unbounded number of sequential observers. However, increasing the input m, one has to employ a larger number of edge parties n than that of the two-input case to demonstrate the sharing of an unbounded number of sequential observers.

TI Hidden quantum correlations in the ground states of quasiclassical spin
   systems
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
AB Frustrated spin models may lead to the formation of both classical noncollinear spin structures and unique quantum phases including highly entangled quantum spin liquids. Here, we study the entanglement and spatial quantum correlations in linear spin-wave theory around a classical spin spiral ground state. We find that the entanglement between pairs of sites is short-ranged, and is completely absent in certain cases. In contrast, the entanglement hidden in multisite clusters is peaked close to phase transitions and shows an asymptotic behavior modulated by the period of the magnetic structure. These findings motivate further exploring the connection in the entanglement properties of fully quantum and of quasiclassical spin models.

TI Analytic Theory for the Dynamics of Wide Quantum Neural Networks
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB Parametrized quantum circuits can be used as quantum neural networks and have the potential to outperform their classical counterparts when trained for addressing learning problems. To date, much of the results on their performance on practical problems are heuristic in nature. In particular, the convergence rate for the training of quantum neural networks is not fully understood. Here, we analyze the dynamics of gradient descent for the training error of a class of variational quantum machine learning models. We define wide quantum neural networks as parametrized quantum circuits in the limit of a large number of qubits and variational parameters. Then, we find a simple analytic formula that captures the average behavior of their loss function and discuss the consequences of our findings. For example, for random quantum circuits, we predict and characterize an exponential decay of the residual training error as a function of the parameters of the system. Finally, we validate our analytic results with numerical experiments.

TI Quantum simulation of nonlinear dynamical systems using repeated
   measurement
SO JOURNAL OF PLASMA PHYSICS
AB We present a quantum algorithm based on repeated measurement to solve initial-value problems for nonlinear ordinary differential equations (ODEs), which may be generated from partial differential equations in plasma physics. We map a dynamical system to a Hamiltonian form, where the Hamiltonian matrix is a function of dynamical variables. To advance in time, we measure expectation values from the previous time step and evaluate the Hamiltonian function classically, which introduces stochasticity into the dynamics. We then perform standard quantum Hamiltonian simulation over a short time, using the evaluated constant Hamiltonian matrix. This approach requires evolving an ensemble of quantum states, which are consumed each step to measure the required observables. We apply this approach to the classic logistic and Lorenz systems, in both integrable and chaotic regimes. Our analysis shows that the solutions' accuracy is influenced by both the stochastic sampling rate and the nature of the dynamical system.

TI Energetics of a Single Qubit Gate
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB Qubits are physical, a quantum gate thus not only acts on the information carried by the qubit but also on its energy. What is then the corresponding flow of energy between the qubit and the controller that implements the gate? Here we exploit a superconducting platform to answer this question in the case of a quantum gate realized by a resonant drive field. During the gate, the superconducting qubit becomes entangled with the microwave drive pulse so that there is a quantum superposition between energy flows. We measure the energy change in the drive field conditioned on the outcome of a projective qubit measurement. We demonstrate that the drive's energy change associated with the measurement backaction can exceed by far the energy that can be extracted by the qubit. This can be understood by considering the qubit as a weak measurement apparatus of the driving field.

TI Wafer-scale fabrication of InGaP-on-insulator for nonlinear and quantum
   photonic applications
SO APPLIED PHYSICS LETTERS
AB The development of manufacturable and scalable integrated nonlinear photonic materials is driving key technologies in diverse areas, such as high-speed communications, signal processing, sensing, and quantum information. Here, we demonstrate a nonlinear platform-InGaP-on-insulator-optimized for visible-to-telecommunication wavelength chi((2)) nonlinear optical processes. In this work, we detail our 100 mm wafer-scale InGaP-on-insulator fabrication process realized via wafer bonding, optical lithography, and dry-etching techniques. The resulting wafers yield 1000 s of components in each fabrication cycle, with initial designs that include chip-to-fiber couplers, 12.5-cm-long nested spiral waveguides, and arrays of microring resonators with free-spectral ranges spanning 400-900 GHz. We demonstrate intrinsic resonator quality factors as high as 324 000 (440 000) for single-resonance (split-resonance) modes near 1550 nm corresponding to 1.56 dB/cm (1.22 dB/cm) propagation loss. We analyze the loss vs waveguide width and resonator radius to establish the operating regime for optimal 775-1550 nm phase matching. By combining the high chi((2)) and chi((3)) optical nonlinearity of InGaP with wafer-scale fabrication and low propagation loss, these results open promising possibilities for entangled-photon, multi-photon, and squeezed light generation.

TI Adaptive diversity-based quantum circuit architecture search
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Quantum variational algorithms (VQAs) are highly promising to realize quantum advantages on near-term quantum devices. Existing VQAs based on a manually fixed quantum Ansatz are computationally inefficient due to noise and the limited coupling maps of these devices. Previous work considers various quantum architecture search (QAS) algorithms to autodesign a quantum Ansatz based on specific questions to improve the performance of VQAs. Compared to manual design, autodesign can more efficiently explore the large space of a possible Ansatz and achieve better performance. However, two main challenges in utilizing QAS to design quantum circuits efficiently are the tremendous amount of space required for candidate quantum circuits, and the disconnection between quantum devices and autodesign in terms of qubit mapping and quantum noise. To address these issues, we propose an adaptive diversity-based quantum Ansatz search algorithm to efficiently generate the optimal quantum circuit based on device qubit mapping and noise. By considering the diversity among different candidate circuits and adaptively adding circuit depths, our approach only needs to focus on a small optimization space at each iteration step. In addition, the synchronization of optimizing circuit structure and aligning qubit mapping enables us to generate quantum circuits while avoiding additional mapping overhead. We evaluate the performance of our algorithm on simulators and real quantum devices for quantum eigenvalue problems and classification tasks. Results demonstrate that quantum circuits generated by our method outperform both a fixed hardware-efficient Ansatz and randomly generated quantum circuits in terms of final performance and resource-saving. Our algorithm provides a flexible way to efficiently generate excellent quantum circuits for significantly improving the performances of VQAs on near-term quantum devices.

TI The complexity of NISQ
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB The recent proliferation of NISQ devices has made it imperative to understand their power. In this work, we define and study the complexity class NISQ, which encapsulates problems that can be efficiently solved by a classical computer with access to noisy quantum circuits. We establish super-polynomial separations in the complexity among classical computation, NISQ, and fault-tolerant quantum computation to solve some problems based on modifications of Simon's problems. We then consider the power of NISQ for three well-studied problems. For unstructured search, we prove that NISQ cannot achieve a Grover-like quadratic speedup over classical computers. For the Bernstein-Vazirani problem, we show that NISQ only needs a number of queries logarithmic in what is required for classical computers. Finally, for a quantum state learning problem, we prove that NISQ is exponentially weaker than classical computers with access to noiseless constant-depth quantum circuits.

TI Near- and long-term quantum algorithmic approaches for vibrational
   spectroscopy
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Determining the vibrational structure of a molecule is central to fundamental applications in several areas, from atmospheric science to catalysis, fuel combustion modeling, biochemical imaging, and astrochemistry. However, when significant anharmonicity and mode coupling are present, the problem is classically intractable for a molecule of just a few atoms. Here, we outline a set of quantum algorithms for solving the molecular vibrational structure problem for both near- and long-term quantum computers. There are previously unaddressed characteristics of this problem which require approaches distinct from most instances of the commonly studied quantum simulation of electronic structure: many eigenstates are often desired, states of interest are often far from the ground state (requiring methods for "zooming in" to some energy window), particle conservation is not required, and transition amplitudes with respect to a nonunitary Hermitian operator must be calculated. We address each of these hurdles and consider problem instances of four molecular vibrational Hamiltonians. Finally and most importantly, we give analytical and numerical results which suggest that, to a given energy precision, a vibrational problem instance will be simulatable on a quantum computer before an electronic structure problem instance. These results imply that more focus in the quantum information community ought to shift toward scientifically and industrially important quantum vibrational problems.

TI Optimal (controlled) quantum state preparation and improved unitary
   synthesis by quantum circuits with any number of ancillary qubits
SO QUANTUM
AB As a cornerstone for many quantum linear algebraic and quantum machine learn-ing algorithms, controlled quantum state preparation (CQSP) aims to provide the transformation of |i) |0n) -|i) |I/4) for all i E {0, 1}k for the given n-qubit states |li). In this paper, we construct a quantum circuit for implementing CQSP, with depth ( l (2n+kl O n + k + 2n+k n+k+m and size O for any given number m of ancillary qubits. These bounds, which can also be viewed as a time-space tradeoff for the transforma-tion, are optimal for any integer parameters m, k > 0 and n > 1. When k = 0, the problem becomes the canonical quantum state preparation (QSP) problem with ancillary qubits, which asks for efficient implementations of the trans-formation |0n) |0m) -|1P) |0m). This problem has many applications with many investigations, yet its circuit complexity remains open. Our construction completely solves this problem, pinning down its depth complexity to O(n + 2n/(n + m)) and its size complexity to O(2n) for any m. Another fundamental problem, unitary synthesis, asks to implement a general n- qubit unitary by a quantum circuit. Previous work shows a lower bound of 9(n + 4n/(n + m)) and an upper bound of O(n2n) for m = 9(2n/n) ancillary qubits. In this paper, we quadratically shrink this gap by presenting a quantum circuit of the ( l depth of O n2n/2 + n1/223n/2 m1/2 .

TI Predicting arbitrary state properties from single Hamiltonian quench
   dynamics
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Analog quantum simulation is an essential routine for quantum computing and plays a crucial role in studying quantum many-body physics. Typically, the quantum evolution of an analog simulator is largely determined by its physical characteristics, lacking the precise control or versatility of quantum gates. This limitation poses challenges in extracting physical properties on analog quantum simulators, an essential step of quantum simulations. To address this issue, we introduce the Hamiltonian shadow protocol, which uses a single quench Hamiltonian for estimating arbitrary state properties, eliminating the need for ancillary systems and random unitaries. Additionally, we derive the sample complexity of this protocol and show that it performs comparably to the classical shadow protocol. The Hamiltonian shadow protocol does not require sophisticated control and can be applied to a wide range of analog quantum simulators. We demonstrate its utility through numerical demonstrations with Rydberg atom arrays under realistic parameter settings. The new protocol significantly broadens the application of randomized measurements for analog quantum simulators without precise control and ancillary systems.

TI Automated gadget discovery in the quantum domain
SO MACHINE LEARNING-SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB In recent years, reinforcement learning (RL) has become increasingly successful in its application to the quantum domain and the process of scientific discovery in general. However, while RL algorithms learn to solve increasingly complex problems, interpreting the solutions they provide becomes ever more challenging. In this work, we gain insights into an RL agent's learned behavior through a post-hoc analysis based on sequence mining and clustering. Specifically, frequent and compact subroutines, used by the agent to solve a given task, are distilled as gadgets and then grouped by various metrics. This process of gadget discovery develops in three stages: First, we use an RL agent to generate data, then, we employ a mining algorithm to extract gadgets and finally, the obtained gadgets are grouped by a density-based clustering algorithm. We demonstrate our method by applying it to two quantum-inspired RL environments. First, we consider simulated quantum optics experiments for the design of high-dimensional multipartite entangled states where the algorithm finds gadgets that correspond to modern interferometer setups. Second, we consider a circuit-based quantum computing environment where the algorithm discovers various gadgets for quantum information processing, such as quantum teleportation. This approach for analyzing the policy of a learned agent is agent and environment agnostic and can yield interesting insights into any agent's policy.

TI Integrable nonunitary open quantum circuits
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
AB We explicitly construct an integrable and strongly interacting dissipative quantum circuit via a trotterization of the Hubbard model with imaginary interaction strength. To prove integrability, we build an inhomogeneous transfer matrix, from which conserved superoperator charges can be derived, in particular, the circuit's dynamical generator. After showing the trace preservation and complete positivity of local maps, we reinterpret them as the Kraus representation of the local dynamics of free fermions with single-site dephasing. The integrability of the map is broken by adding interactions to the local coherent dynamics or by removing the dephasing. In particular, even circuits built from convex combinations of local free-fermion unitaries are nonintegrable. Moreover, the construction allows us to explicitly build circuits belonging to different non-Hermitian symmetry classes, which are characterized by the behavior under transposition instead of complex conjugation. We confirm all our analytical results by using complex spacing ratios to examine the spectral statistics of the dissipative circuits.

TI Maximizing Wireless Sensor Networks Coverage and Connectivity in
   Irregular Terrains Using Grover's Quantum Algorithm
SO IEEE SENSORS JOURNAL
AB The complicated topographical limitations and NP-hard nature of the sensor placement problem make it difficult to achieve optimal coverage and connectivity in wireless sensor networks (WSNs) deployed over irregular terrains. WSNs encounter critical challenges in uneven regions due to irregular obstacles, elevation variations, and dynamic terrain profiles, all of which influence coverage and connectivity. Classical methods, such as greedy or evolutionary strategies, often struggle to scale efficiently as terrain complexity increases and may converge to suboptimal solutions due to their heuristic nature. This article applies Grover's quantum search algorithm to enhance sensor placement, the primary focus of this study. Unlike classical techniques that traverse solution spaces step by step, the Grover algorithm enhances the search process with a quadratic speedup. This enhancement enables the efficient identification of near-optimal sensor configurations in complicated contexts. This quantum-assisted method not only reduces the number of necessary sensors but also enhances performance in coverage and connectivity metrics, along with a substantial decrease in computation burden. The integration of terrain awareness and quantum search diverges significantly from traditional approaches, providing an intelligent, scalable, and computationally promising methodology for WSN deployment in the real-world terrains.

TI Hot atomic vapors for nonlinear and quantum optics

AB Nonlinear optics has been a very dynamic field of research with spectacular phenomena discovered mainly after the invention of lasers. The combination of high intensity fields with resonant systems has further enhanced the nonlinearity with specific additional effects related to the resonances. In this paper we review a limited range of these effects which has been studied in the past decades using close-to-room-temperature atomic vapors as the nonlinear resonant medium. In particular we describe four-wave mixing and generation of nonclassical light in atomic vapors. One-and two-mode squeezing as well as photon correlations are discussed. Furthermore, we present some applications for optical and quantum memories based on hot atomic vapors. Finally, we present results on the recently developed field of quantum fluids of light using hot atomic vapors.

TI Volcano architecture for scalable quantum processor units
SO SCIENCE CHINA-PHYSICS MECHANICS & ASTRONOMY
AB Quantum information processing platforms based on array of matter qubits, such as neutral atoms, trapped ions, and quantum dots, face significant challenges in scalable addressing and readout as system sizes increase. Here, we propose the "Volcano" architecture that establishes a new quantum processing unit implementation method based on optical channel mapping on an arbitrarily arranged static qubit array. To support the feasibility of Volcano architecture, we show a proof-of-principle demonstration by employing a photonic chip that leverages custom-designed three-dimensional waveguide structures to transform one-dimensional beam arrays into arbitrary two-dimensional output patterns matching qubit array geometries. We demonstrate parallel and independent control of 49-channel system with negligible crosstalk and high uniformity. This architecture addresses the challenges in scaling up quantum processors, including both the classical link for parallel qubit control and the quantum link for efficient photon collection, and holds the potential for interfacing with neutral atom arrays and trapped ion crystals, as well as networking of heterogeneous quantum systems.

TI Nondegenerate Noise-Resilient Superconducting Qubit
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB We propose a superconducting qubit based on engineering the first and second harmonics of the Josephson energy and phase relation E-J1 cos Phi and E-J2 cos 2 phi. By constructing a circuit such that E(J2 )is negative and |E-J1| << |E-J2|, we create a periodic potential with two nondegenerate minima. The qubit, which we dub "harmonium," is formed from the lowest-energy states of each minimum. Bit-flip protection of the qubit arises due to the localization of each qubit state to their respective minima, while phase-flip protection can be understood by considering the circuit within the Born-Oppenheimer approximation. We demonstrate with time-domain simulations that single-and two-qubit gates can be performed in approximately 100 ns. Finally, we compute the qubit coherence times using numerical diagonalization of the complete circuit in conjunction with state-of-the-art noise models. We estimate out-of-manifold heating times on the order of milliseconds, which can be treated as erasure errors using conventional dispersive readout. We estimate pure-dephasing times on the order of many tens of milliseconds, and bit-flip times on the order of seconds.

TI Entanglement and U(D)-spin squeezing in symmetric multi-quDit
   systems and applications to quantum phase transitions in
   Lipkin-Meshkov-Glick D-level atom models
SO QUANTUM INFORMATION PROCESSING
AB Collective spin operators for symmetric multi-quDit (namely identical D-level atom) systems generate a U(D) symmetry. We explore generalizations to arbitrary D of SU(2)-spin coherent states and their adaptation to parity (multi-component Schrodinger cats), together with multi-mode extensions of NOON states. We write level, one- and two-quDit reduced density matrices of symmetric N-quDit states, expressed in the last two cases in terms of collective U(D)-spin operator expectation values. Then, we evaluate level and particle entanglement for symmetric multi-quDit states with linear and von Neumann entropies of the corresponding reduced density matrices. In particular, we analyze the numerical and variational ground state of Lipkin-Meshkov-Glick models of 3-level identical atoms. We also propose an extension of the concept of SU(2)-spin squeezing to SU(D) and relate it to pairwise D-level atom entanglement. Squeezing parameters and entanglement entropies are good markers that characterize the different quantum phases, and their corresponding critical points, that take place in these interacting D-level atom models.

TI A hybrid multi-node QKD-ECC architecture for securing IoT networks
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB The rapid expansion of Internet of Things (IoT) applications in sectors like smart cities, healthcare, and industrial automation has introduced serious security challenges due to limited device resources and growing threats from quantum computing. Traditional cryptographic techniques such as RSA and AES are increasingly inadequate, particularly against quantum attacks, and face limitations in scalability and efficiency in multi-node environments. To overcome these challenges, this paper proposes a lightweight and quantum-resilient security framework for IoT networks based on Multi-Node Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) integrated with Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC), termed MNQ-ECC. The proposed architecture enables secure key generation and exchange across multiple nodes and includes four security phases: pre-deployment, registration, login, and authentication. Here, performance evaluation is carried out using Qiskit simulators under varying network conditions and key performance metrics such as key generation rate, entropy, latency, and communication overhead are analysed. The results demonstrate that MNQ-ECC achieves 99.5% resistance to quantum attacks, improves key generation efficiency by 30%, and reduces encryption overhead by 20% compared to standard ECC. These findings confirm the framework's effectiveness in securing IoT networks with high scalability, low latency, and strong resilience against classical and quantum threats.

TI Intrinsic quantum Mpemba effect in Markovian systems and quantum
   circuits
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
AB The quantum Mpemba effect (QME) describes the counterintuitive phenomenon in which a system farther from equilibrium reaches the steady state faster than one closer to equilibrium. However, ambiguity in defining a suitable distance measure between quantum states has led to varied interpretations across different contexts. Here we propose the intrinsic quantum Mpemba effect (IQME), defined using the trajectory length traced by the quantum state as a more appropriate measure of distance-distinct from previous trajectory-independent metrics. By treating quantum states as points in a Riemannian space defined by statistical distance, the trajectory length emerges as a more natural and accurate characterization of the counterintuitive dynamics, drawing an analogy to the classical Brachistochrone problem. We demonstrate the existence of IQME in Markovian systems and extend its definition to quantum circuits, thereby establishing a unified framework applicable to both open and closed systems. Notably, we observe an IQME in a U(1)-symmetric circuit, offering insights into the rates of quantum thermalization for different initial states. This work reveals a relatively unexplored nonequilibrium quantum phenomenon, thereby advancing our understanding of quantum state evolution.

TI Airborne reflectors for satellite-based quantum entanglement and key
   distribution
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB Satellite-based quantum communication faces challenges due to link intensity loss over long distances caused by various factors such as geometric loss and atmospheric attenuation. These effects can lead to lower entanglement distribution rates, secret key rates, and increased quantum bit error rates, especially in direct satellite-to-ground communication. This paper proposes a practical solution: the design of an airborne gold-coated parabolic reflector to be placed in the stratosphere directly above the ground station. This reflector effectively acts as a second virtual transmitter, a novel concept introduced in this work. The proposed method brings about a substantial increase in the distributed entanglement rate, boosting it by up to 25 times at zenith compared to direct satellite-to-ground communication. It also reduces the minimum elevation angle for secure communication, approximately from \documentclass[12pt]{minimal} \usepackage{amsmath} \usepackage{wasysym} \usepackage{amsfonts} \usepackage{amssymb} \usepackage{amsbsy} \usepackage{mathrsfs} \usepackage{upgreek} \setlength{\oddsidemargin}{-69pt} \begin{document}$$28<^>{\circ }$$\end{document} to \documentclass[12pt]{minimal} \usepackage{amsmath} \usepackage{wasysym} \usepackage{amsfonts} \usepackage{amssymb} \usepackage{amsbsy} \usepackage{mathrsfs} \usepackage{upgreek} \setlength{\oddsidemargin}{-69pt} \begin{document}$$18<^>{\circ }$$\end{document} for BB84 and from \documentclass[12pt]{minimal} \usepackage{amsmath} \usepackage{wasysym} \usepackage{amsfonts} \usepackage{amssymb} \usepackage{amsbsy} \usepackage{mathrsfs} \usepackage{upgreek} \setlength{\oddsidemargin}{-69pt} \begin{document}$$36<^>{\circ }$$\end{document} to \documentclass[12pt]{minimal} \usepackage{amsmath} \usepackage{wasysym} \usepackage{amsfonts} \usepackage{amssymb} \usepackage{amsbsy} \usepackage{mathrsfs} \usepackage{upgreek} \setlength{\oddsidemargin}{-69pt} \begin{document}$$22<^>{\circ }$$\end{document} for E91 when using the proposed reflector method compared to direct satellite-to-ground communication.

Fidelity of states can be used to judge whether there is entanglement in multi-particle systems. It is well known that quantum channel security in QKD can be estimated by measuring the robustness of Bell-type inequality against noise. We experimentally investigate a new Bell-type inequality (NBTI) in the three-photon Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) states with different levels of spin-flip noise. The results show that the fidelity and the degree of violation of the NBTI decrease monotonically with the increase of noise intensity. They also provide a method to judge whether there is entanglement in three-particle mixed states.

TI Quantum Fisher Information and Bures Distance Correlations of Coupled
   Two Charge-Qubits Inside a Coherent Cavity with the Intrinsic
   Decoherence
SO SYMMETRY-BASEL
AB The dynamics of two charged qubits containing Josephson Junctions inside a cavity are investigated under the intrinsic decoherence effect. New types of quantum correlations via local quantum Fisher information and Bures distance norm are explored. We show that we can control the quantum correlations robustness by the intrinsic decoherence rate, the qubit-qubit coupling as well as by the initial coherent states superposition. The phenomenon of sudden changes and the freezing behavior for the local quantum Fisher information are sensitive to the initial coherent state superposition and the intrinsic decoherence.

TI Post-Quantum Security: Opportunities and Challenges
SO SENSORS
AB Cryptography is very essential in our daily life, not only for confidentiality of information, but also for information integrity verification, non-repudiation, authentication, and other aspects. In modern society, cryptography is widely used; everything from personal life to national security is inseparable from it. With the emergence of quantum computing, traditional encryption methods are at risk of being cracked. People are beginning to explore methods for defending against quantum computer attacks. Among the methods currently developed, quantum key distribution is a technology that uses the principles of quantum mechanics to distribute keys. Post-quantum encryption algorithms are encryption methods that rely on mathematical challenges that quantum computers cannot solve quickly to ensure security. In this study, an integrated review of post-quantum encryption algorithms is conducted from the perspective of traditional cryptography. First, the concept and development background of post-quantum encryption are introduced. Then, the post-quantum encryption algorithm Kyber is studied. Finally, the achievements, difficulties and outstanding problems in this emerging field are summarized, and some predictions for the future are made.

TI Effect of the Time Delay between Spin State Preparation and Measurement
   on Electron Spin Teleportation in a Covalent Donor-Acceptor-Radical
   System
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY LETTERS
AB We recently demonstrated photodriven quantum teleportation of an electron spin state in a covalent donor-acceptor-radical (D-A-R-center dot) system. Following specific spin state preparation on R-center dot with a microwave pulse, photoexcitation of A results in two-step electron transfer producing D center dot+-A-R-, where the spin state on R-center dot is teleported to D center dot+. This study examines the effects of varying the time (tau(D)) between spin state preparation and photoinitiated teleportation. Using pulse electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy, the spin echo of D center dot+ resulting from teleportation shows a damped oscillation as a function of tau(D) that is simulated using a density matrix model, which provides a fundamental understanding of the echo behavior. Teleportation fidelity calculations also show oscillatory behavior as a function of tau(D) due to the accumulation of a phase factor between  S-x  and  S-y . Understanding experimental parameters intrinsic to quantum teleportation in molecular systems is crucial to leveraging this phenomenon for quantum information applications.

TI Non-Markovian Dynamics in Fiber Delay-Line Buffers
SO ADVANCED QUANTUM TECHNOLOGIES
AB The non-Markovian effect is studied on a two-photon polarization entangled state, in which one photon from the pair is stored in a fiber delay-line buffer. A model of a photonic qubit coupled to fiber birefringence and a fiber reservoir representing the environment is proposed. Analytically, a non-Markovian probability function is derived for the buffered photon and its paired photon. To verify the probability function, full quantum state tomography of the photon pairs is performed. The probability function fits well with the experimental data and physical values. These results indicate that the quantum system operates slightly above the threshold for a non-Markovian transition. We observe a unique polarization dynamic of the buffered photon. Measures of quantum mutual information are further exploited to study the quantumness of the photon pairs. Werner's well-known separability criterion occurs at a buffer time of about 0.9 ms. These results imply that quantum discord can surpass Werner's criterion, and hence, quantum bi-partite correlation can exist for buffer times greater than 0.9 ms.

TI Continuous-variable quantum sensing of a dissipative reservoir

AB We propose a continuous-variable quantum sensing scheme, in which a harmonic oscillator is employed as the probe to estimate the parameters in the spectral density of a quantum reservoir, within a non-Markovian dynamical framework. It is revealed that the sensing sensitivity can be effectively boosted by (i) optimizing the weight of the momentum-position-type coupling in the whole probe-reservoir interaction Hamiltonian, (ii) the initial quantum squeezing resource provided by the probe, (iii) the noncanonical equilibration induced by the non-Markovian effect, and (iv) applying an external driving field. Our results may have some potential applications in understanding and controlling the decoherence of dissipative continuous-variable systems.

TI Quantum generative adversarial network for image generation
SO VISUAL COMPUTER
AB Quantum machine learning as a field has emerged rather quickly thanks to developments in quantum computing. Of these developments, the one of primary interest is the Quantum Generative Adversarial Network or QGAN which is an enhancement of the familiar GAN to use quantum computation necessary for producing synthetic images. To sum up, based on different types of experiments, QGANs outperformed classical GANs, especially in cases with images such as MNIST and Fashion MNIST datasets. Nevertheless, their capabilities are not fully comprehensible due to existing constraints in quantum systems technology, especially in the NISQ era. In this regard, the current study undertakes a proposed research direction that focuses on improving the resolution of grayscale images that have been produced from the "optdigits" dataset, which contains handwritten digit images. Our work then contrasts this with prior work in terms of FID scores, loss function values, runtime, and the resolution of the images. Further, we extend the work by carrying out the proposed methodology on the FMNIST dataset and provide results to corroborate the efficacy of the proposed technique, besides enabling comparison on the same platform with prior works.

TI Emotion Quantification Using Variational Quantum State Fidelity
   Estimation
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB Sentiment analysis has been instrumental in developing artificial intelligence when applied to various domains. However, most sentiments and emotions are temporal and often exist in a complex manner. Several emotions can be experienced at the same time. Instead of recognizing only categorical information about emotions, there is a need to understand and quantify the intensity of emotions. The proposed research intends to investigate a quantum-inspired approach for quantifying emotional intensities in runtime. The inspiration comes from manifesting human cognition and decision-making capabilities, which may adopt a brief explanation through quantum theory. Quantum state fidelity was used to characterize states and estimate emotion intensities rendered by subjects from the Amsterdam Dynamic Facial Expression Set (ADFES) dataset. The Quantum variational classifier technique was used to perform this experiment on the IBM Quantum Experience platform. The proposed method successfully quantifies the intensities of joy, sadness, contempt, anger, surprise, and fear emotions of labelled subjects from the ADFES dataset.

TI Fundamental Thresholds for Computational and Erasure Errors via the
   Coherent Information
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB Quantum error correcting (QEC) codes protect quantum information against environmental noise. Computational errors caused by the environment change the quantum state within the qubit subspace, whereas quantum erasures correspond to the loss of qubits at known positions. Correcting either type of error involves different correction mechanisms, which makes studying the interplay between erasure and computational errors particularly challenging. In this work, we propose a framework based on the coherent information (CI) of the mixed-state density operator associated to noisy QEC codes, for treating both types of errors together. We show how to rigorously derive different families of statistical mechanics mappings for generic stabilizer QEC codes in the presence of both types of errors. We observe that the erasure errors enter as a classical average over fully depolarizing channels. Further, we show that computing the CI for erasure errors only can be done efficiently upon sampling over erasure configurations. We then test our approach on the two-dimensional toric and color codes and compute optimal thresholds for erasure errors only, finding a 50% threshold for both codes. This strengthens the notion that both codes share the same optimal thresholds. When considering both computational and erasure errors, the CI of smallsize codes yields thresholds in very accurate agreement with established results that have been obtained in the thermodynamic limit. Next, we perform a similar analysis for a low-density parity-check (LDPC) code-the lift-connected surface code. We find a 50% threshold under erasure errors alone and, for the first time, derive the exact statistical mechanics mappings in the presence of both computational and erasure errors. We thereby further establish the CI as a practical tool for studying optimal thresholds for code classes beyond topological codes under realistic noise, and as a means for uncovering new relations between QEC codes and statistical physics models.

TI Quantum computation in power systems: An overview of recent advances
SO ENERGY REPORTS
AB Quantum mechanics (QM) can be understood as a set of rules that forms the basis for developing all quantum theories. One of these theories is quantum computation (QC), i.e., computation based on QM logic. It is believed that QC provides paths to the problem solution that may not be possible for classical computers. Therefore, it has received attention to solve complex computational problems in different areas. Most of the research efforts, however, have concentrated on problems in theoretical physics and computer science, leaving little attention to solve practical problems in industrial applications. This is particularly true in power system applications where QC is mostly unknown. This paper mainly aims to attract the attention of power system researchers/engineers to QC as a potential solution to address emerging computational challenges of power systems. To this end, the historical development of QC and its fundamental concepts are first described. Then, recent contributions to solving computationally -demanding power system problems such as AC and DC power flow (PF), contingency analysis, state estimation, electromagnetic transients simulation (EMT), fault diagnosis, unit commitment (UC), and facility location-allocation (FLA) problems are discussed. Unfortunately, power system researchers have not yet been able to convincingly demonstrate a quantum advantage in solving large-scale power system problems mainly because we are in the noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) era, where quantum devices are noisy and have limited quantum resources. However, it may be demonstrated in the future with technological advances and increased research efforts in the area.(c) 2022 Pubilshed By Elsevier Ltd.

TI Preparing Schrödinger Cat States in a Microwave Cavity Using a Neural
   Network
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB Scaling up quantum computing devices requires solving ever more complex quantum control tasks. Machine learning has been proposed as a promising approach to tackle the resulting challenges. However, experimental implementations are still scarce. In this work, we demonstrate experimentally a neuralnetwork-based preparation of Schr & ouml;dinger cat states in a cavity coupled dispersively to a qubit. We show that it is possible to teach a neural network to output optimized control pulses for a whole family of quantum states. After being trained in simulations, the network takes a description of the target quantum state as input and rapidly produces the pulse shape for the experiment, without any need for time-consuming additional optimization or retraining for different states. Our experimental results demonstrate more generally how deep neural networks and transfer learning can produce efficient simultaneous solutions to a range of quantum control tasks, which will benefit not only state preparation but also parametrized quantum gates.

TI Predetection squeezing as a resource for high-dimensional Bell-state
   measurements
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Bell measurements, entailing the projection onto one of the Bell states, play a key role in quantum information and communication, where the outcome of a variety of protocols crucially depends on the success probability of such measurements. Although in the case of qubit systems, Bell measurements can be implemented using only linear optical components, the same result is no longer true for qudits, where at least the use of ancillary photons is required. In order to circumvent this limitation, one possibility is to introduce nonlinear effects. In this work, we adopt the latter approach and propose a scalable Bell measurement scheme for high-dimensional states, exploiting multiple squeezer devices applied to a linear optical circuit for discriminating the different Bell states. Our approach does not require ancillary photons, is not limited by the dimension of the quantum states, and is experimentally scalable, thus paving the way toward the realization of an effective high-dimensional Bell measurement.

TI Coherent interaction-free detection of noise
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB The measurement and characterization of noise is a flourishing area of research in mesoscopic physics. In this work, we propose interaction-free measurements as a noise-detection technique, exploring two conceptually different schemes: the coherent and the projective realizations. These detectors consist of a qutrit whose second transition is resonantly coupled to an oscillatory field that may have noise in amplitude or phase. For comparison, we consider a more standard detector previously discussed in this context: a qubit coupled in a similar way to the noise source. We find that the qutrit scheme offers clear advantages, allowing precise detection and characterization of the noise, while the qubit does not. Finally, we study the signature of noise correlations in the detector's signal.

TI Lithium-ion battery state of health estimation method based on
   variational quantum algorithm optimized stacking strategy
SO ENERGY REPORTS
AB Accurate state -of -health (SOH) estimation is critical for the performance and safety of lithium -ion batteries. An innovative method for SOH estimation is proposed by employing a variational quantum algorithm to optimize a stacking integrated learning strategy. The strategy effectively combines multiple model advantages, enhancing the estimation accuracy and generalizability. Using this method, eight sets of health factors are extracted, focusing on the relationship between battery capacity degradation and electrothermal parameters. A stacking integrated learning framework is developed by utilizing diverse primary learners to effectively capture the dynamic changes in health factors. A ridge regression meta -learner is incorporated to address overfitting problems found in primary learners. A significant innovation is the integration of a variational quantum circuit module as the primary learner. This module plays a crucial role in optimizing the hyperparameters for the analysis of complex and high -dimensional battery data. The effectiveness of the method is validated using four different types of batteries, showing a 77.4% improvement in prediction accuracy compared with traditional methods, with the SOH estimation error maintained within a tight margin of 0.67%. The mean absolute error, mean absolute percentage error, and root mean square error with maximum reduction rates are 76.7%, 77.4%, and 62.7%, respectively. The maximum increase in the R -squared coefficient is 5.3%. This study demonstrates the potential of variational quantum algorithms in enhancing the SOH estimation accuracy and opens new possibilities for the advanced health status management of lithium -ion batteries.

TI Fast-forwarding quantum simulation with real-time quantum Krylov
   subspace algorithms
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Quantum subspace diagonalization (QSD) algorithms have emerged as a competitive family of algorithms that avoid many of the optimization pitfalls associated with parameterized quantum circuit algorithms. While the vast majority of QSD algorithms have focused on solving the eigenpair problem for ground-state, excited-state, and thermal observable estimations, there has been a lot less work in considering QSD algorithms for the problem of quantum dynamical simulation. In this work, we propose several quantum Krylov fast-forwarding algorithms capable of predicting long-time dynamics well beyond the coherence time of current quantum hardware. Our algorithms use real-time evolved Krylov basis states prepared on a quantum computer and a multireference subspace method to ensure convergence towards high-fidelity, long-time dynamics. In particular, we show that the proposed multireference methodology provides a systematic way of trading off circuit depth with classical postprocessing complexity. We also demonstrate the efficacy of our approach through numerical implementations for several quantum chemistry problems, including the calculation of the autocorrelation and dipole moment correlation functions.

TI The impact of quantum circuit architecture and hyperparameters on
   variational quantum algorithms exemplified in the electronic structure
   of the GaAs crystal
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB Variational Quantum Algorithms (VQAs) provide a promising framework for solving electronic structure problems using the computational capabilities of quantum computers to explore high-dimensional Hilbert spaces efficiently. This research investigates the performance of VQAs in electronic structure calculations of gallium arsenide (GaAs), a semiconductor with a zinc-blende structure. Utilizing a tight-binding Hamiltonian and a Jordan-Wigner-like transformation, we map the problem to a 10-qubit Hamiltonian. We analyze the impact of quantum circuit architectures, algorithm hyperparameters, and optimization methods on two VQAs: Variational Quantum Deflation (VQD) and Subspace Search Variational Quantum Eigensolver (SSVQE). We observed that while both algorithms offer promising results, the choice of ansatz and hyperparameter tuning were especially critical in achieving reliable outcomes, particularly for higher energy states. Adjusting the hyperparameters in VQD significantly enhanced the accuracy of higher energy state calculations, reducing the error by an order of magnitude, whereas tuning the hyperparameters in SSVQE had minimal impact. Our findings provide insights into optimizing VQAs for electronic structure problems, paving the way for their application to more complex systems on near-term quantum devices.

TI Quantum-assisted trustworthiness for the Quantum Internet
SO PLOS ONE
AB Device redundancy is one of the most well-known mechanisms in distributed systems to increase the overall system fault tolerance and, consequently, trustworthiness. Existing algorithms in this regard aim to exchange a significant number of messages among nodes to identify and agree which communication links or nodes are faulty. This approach greatly degrades the performance of those wireless communication networks exposed to limited available bandwidth and/or energy consumption due to messages flooding. Lately, quantum-assisted mechanisms have been envisaged as an appealing alternative to improve the performance in this kind of communication networks and have been shown to obtain levels of performance close to the ones achieved in ideal conditions. The purpose of this paper is to further explore this approach by using super-additivity and superposed quantum trajectories in quantum Internet to obtain a higher system trustworthiness. More specifically, the wireless communication network that supports the permafrost telemetry service for the Antarctica together with five operational modes (three of them using classical techniques and two of them using quantum-assisted mechanisms) have been simulated. Obtained results show that the new quantum-assisted mechanisms can increase the system performance by up to a 28%.

TI Measurement-Based Hyperentanglement Distillation for Lossy and
   Distortion Photon State
SO ANNALEN DER PHYSIK
AB The information content of a photon system can be extended by hyperentanglement, but the quality of hyperentanglement will be decreased by the complicated transmission loss and channel noise in quantum information processing. Here, an efficient measurement-based hyperentanglement distillation protocol (MB-HDP) is presented for depressing the effects of complicated transmission loss and channel noise on hyperentanglement. In the MB-HDP, the nonlocal lossy and distortion photon states are coupled to local hyperentangled Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) states using parity measurement and qubit amplification device, and the decoherence caused by bit-flip (phase-flip) error, diverse transmission coefficients and transmission loss can be depressed by the successful measurement results, which can increase the quality of nonlocal hyperentangled photon state. This MB-HDP broadens the application scope of hyperentanglement distillation to nonlocal lossy and distortion photon state with a lower degree of entanglement. In addition, the MB-HDP can further improve the quality of nonlocal hyperentangled photon state by coupling multiple copies of lossy and distortion hyperentangled photon state with local hyperentangled GHZ states. This work demonstrates the ability of measurement-based method for ensuring the quality of nonlocal hyperentanglement, which can improve the integrity and capacity of long-distance quantum information processing.

TI Eigenstate thermalization in dual-unitary quantum circuits: Asymptotics
   of spectral functions
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW E
AB The eigenstate thermalization hypothesis provides to date the most successful description of thermalization in isolated quantum systems by conjecturing statistical properties of matrix elements of typical operators in the (quasi)energy eigenbasis. Here we study the distribution of matrix elements for a class of operators in dual-unitary quantum circuits in dependence of the frequency associated with the corresponding eigenstates. We provide an exact asymptotic expression for the spectral function, i.e., the second moment of this frequency resolved distribution. The latter is obtained from the decay of dynamical correlations between local operators which can be computed exactly from the elementary building blocks of the dual-unitary circuits. Comparing the asymptotic expression with results obtained by exact diagonalization we find excellent agreement. Small fluctuations at finite system size are explicitly related to dynamical correlations at intermediate times and the deviations from their asymptotical dynamics. Moreover, we confirm the expected Gaussian distribution of the matrix elements by computing higher moments numerically.

TI Bidirectional Controlled Quantum State Preparation in High-Dimensional
   Quantum System
SO ANNALEN DER PHYSIK
AB High-dimensional quantum system exhibits unique advantages over the qubit system in some quantum information processing tasks. A program is presented for implementing deterministic bidirectional controlled remote quantum state preparation (BCRSP) in arbitrary N$N$-dimensional (quNit) system. By introducing two generalized Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) states as quantum channels, two communication parties can simultaneously prepare a single-particle high-dimensional state at each other's site under the control of Charlie. Compared with the previous counterparts, the significant advantage of our scheme is that the high-dimensional CNOT operations are not required. Moreover, the performance of this scheme is evaluated. The evaluation of the performance shows that if the quNit is encoded in the spatial mode of single photons, this scheme can be accomplished solely using only linear optical elements.

TI Quantum machine learning-driven surrogate modeling for efficient
   multi-objective optimization of CO2 storage and geothermal
   energy extraction
SO ADVANCES IN GEO-ENERGY RESEARCH
AB CO2 plume geothermal systems offer a promising pathway for simultaneous carbon sequestration and renewable energy production, yet their optimization remains computationally prohibitive due to the complexity of coupled multi-phase flow, heat transport, and thermodynamic processes. This study presents a novel framework that integrates Non-isothermal Unsaturated-saturated Flow and Transport modeling with quantum neural network and hybrid quantum-classical ensemble regressors to accelerate CO2 plume geothermal system design optimization. The methodology employs latin hypercube sampling to generate 1,000 Non-isothermal Unsaturated-saturated Flow and Transport simulations across several parameter spaces, extracting statistical features that undergo rigorous selection through Boruta, Chi-squared, and Pearson correlation algorithms with a standardized weight threshold of higher than 0.75. Two quantum architectures were developed to predict six geothermal variables, including system lifetime, injected, extracted, stored CO2 mass, cumulative energy recovery and average heat extraction rate within lifetime. The quantum models achieved exceptional accuracy for most variables in the test section, with hybrid quantum-classical ensemble regressors architectures consistently outperforming quantum neural network variants, particularly when combined with boruta feature selection. Two optimization algorithms were employed for CO2 plume geothermal system design, including moth flame optimization for single objectives and non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm II for multi-objective scenarios to find robust optimal solutions based on developed surrogate models for injection overpressure, well spacing near and maximizing thermal energy extraction. The framework transformed a computationally intractable optimization requiring extensive simulation time into a rapid calculation while maintaining prediction accuracy comparable to full-physics models.

TI Picosecond synchronization of mode-locked lasers for metropolitan-scale
   quantum networks
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB We demonstrate picosecond-level synchronization of two actively mode-locked Ti:Sapphire lasers via the white rabbit precision time protocol (WR-PTP), tested over 120 km of deployed optical fiber. This synchronization capability, in combination with the highly single-mode, transform-limited pulses produced by each laser, enables their use as pump lasers for indistinguishable photon sources at remote locations in a quantum network. Here, the WR-PTP serves as a scalable network synchronization protocol, and its performance is compared to traditional methods of local synchronization. We demonstrate pulse-to-pulse synchronization better than 3 ps and time deviation (TDEV) values below 4 ps for all averaging times up to 10 s. With a designed coherence time of 35 ps for single photon sources utilizing these lasers, the achievable temporal overlap corresponds to 98% Hong-Ou-Mandel (HOM) interference visibility between independent sources.

TI QBrainNet: harnessing enhanced quantum intelligence for advanced brain
   stroke prediction from medical imaging
SO FRONTIERS IN MEDICINE
AB Introduction Brain stroke is still one of the leading causes of death and long-term disability in the world. Early and correct diagnosis is therefore important for patient outcome. Although Convolution Neural Network (CNN), classical machine learning models, have achieved great progress in medical image classification, they have to face the performance saturation problem when dealing with high-dimensional and complex data such as medical images. To tackle these limitations, we propose QBrainNet, a quantum enhanced model, which is to enhance brain stroke prediction from medical imaging datasets.Methods The model consists of Quantum Neural Networks (QNNs) applied as learning complex patterns in terms of medical images and Variational Quantum Circuits (VQCs) that will be used to optimize the classification. The feature extraction featured in the QNNs utilises quantum properties of superposition and entanglement to extract non-linear high-dimensional patterns in images related to stroke that may not be captured using classical limits. The VQCs, in turn, are applied to optimize the model performance, further allocating the boundaries of the decision and enhancing the model performance in terms of accuracy by optimizing the quantum gates and operators used during the work. QBrainNet utilizes the combination of such quantum properties as entanglement and superposition to represent more complicated non-linear patterns in stroke-specific images in a better manner than a classical application does.Results This paper proposes a hybrid classical-quantum scheme: preprocessing classically, and learning quantum-enhanced. Quantum gates and operators are used when performing the quantum phase to optimize decision boundaries, achieving vastly enhanced prediction accuracy and efficiency performance. Experimental results indicate that QBrainNet has a better accuracy (96%) and AUC-PR (0.97) than the classical models like CNN, SVM, and Random Forest, proving the superior performance of QBrainNet in stroke detection.Discussion The inference time is shorter, so the model can be used as a real-time clinical application. This article points to the possibilities quantum computing can have in revolutionizing medical diagnostics, especially stroke prediction.

TI Multiparty quantum key agreement based on GHZ states
SO EPJ QUANTUM TECHNOLOGY
AB This paper introduces the design process of a multiparty quantum key agreement protocol based on the Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger state in detail. Building on the traditional circle-type quantum key agreement protocol, we introduce a star structure, which significantly improves the speed and efficiency of key agreement. To facilitate the reader's understanding, we provide an example of a four participants quantum key agreement protocol. In the process of quantum state transmission, we perform operations using the Pauli matrix and the Hadamard matrix to ensure that the quantum state remains in one of the four basis states. This significantly enhances the security of the protocol. After rigorous security analysis, we find that the protocol can effectively resist intercept-resend attack, entangle-measure attack, collective attack, and dishonest participant attack. Under a collective attack, if the first particle is subjected to bit-flipping noise, then p < 0.2430 only guarantees r > 0.2 when a = 1. Additionally, we conduct a fairness analysis and evaluate the practical performance of the proposed protocol. In an ideal depolarization noise-free environment, the protocol can achieve a positive key rate only when the global detection efficiency exceeds 0.9636. Finally, we conduct a comprehensive comparative analysis of the protocols. The results show that our proposed protocol is superior to other existing schemes in terms of efficiency and running time.

TI Detecting Spin-Bath Polarization with Quantum Quench Phase Shifts of
   Single Spins in Diamond
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB Single-qubit sensing protocols can be used to measure qubit-bath coupling parameters. However, for sufficiently large coupling, the sensing protocol itself perturbs the bath, which is predicted to result in a characteristic response in the sensing measurements. Here, we observe this bath perturbation, also known as a quantum quench, by preparing the nuclear spin bath of a nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center in polarized initial states and performing phase-resolved spin-echo measurements on the NV electron spin. These measurements reveal a time-dependent phase determined by the initial state of the bath. We derive the relationship between the sensor phase and the Gaussian spin-bath polarization and apply it to reconstruct both the axial and transverse polarization components. Using this insight, we optimize the transfer efficiency of our dynamic nuclear polarization sequence. This technique for directly measuring bath polarization may assist in preparing high-fidelity quantum memory states, improving nanoscale NMR methods, and investigating non-Gaussian quantum baths.

TI Optical tweezers throw and catch single atoms
SO OPTICA
AB Single atoms movable from one place to another would enable a flying quantum memory that can be useful for dynamic quantum computing architectures. Guided atoms, e.g., by optical tweezers, provide a partial solution, but the benefit of flying qubits could be lost if they still interact with the guiding means. Here we propose and experimentally demonstrate freely flying atoms that are not guided but instead thrown and caught by optical tweezers. We provide a set of proof-of-principle flying atom demonstrations, which include atom transport through optical tweezers, atom arrangements by flying atoms, and atom scattering off optical tweezers. In experiments, cold rubidium atoms at 40 mu K temperature are thrown by accelerating optical tweezers, freely fly with up to a speed of 0.65 m/s and free-flying distance of 4.2 mu m, and are recaptured and stopped by decelerating optical tweezers at a transportation efficiency of 94(3)%. Flying atoms suggest possible applications such as defect correction in a tweezer trap atom array, fast atom-array formation, Rydberg-atom collision studies, and dynamic quantum computing architectures.

TI Periodic Cavity State Revivals from Atomic Frequency Combs
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB Spin ensembles with a comb-shaped spectrum have shown exciting properties as efficient quantum memories. Here, we present a rigorous theoretical study of such atomic frequency combs in the strong coupling limit of cavity QED, based on a full quantum treatment using tensor-network methods. Our results demonstrate that arbitrary multiphoton states in the cavity are almost perfectly absorbed by the spin ensemble and reemitted as parity-flipped states at periodic time intervals. Fidelity values near unity are achieved in these revived states by compensating for energy shifts induced by the strong spin-cavity coupling through adjustments of individual coupling values of the teeth in the atomic frequency comb.

TI Strain induced coupling and quantum information processing with
   hexagonal boron nitride quantum emitters
SO QUANTUM SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB We propose an electromechanical scheme where the electronic degrees of freedom of boron vacancy color centers hosted by a hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) nanoribbon are coupled for quantum information processing. The mutual coupling of color centers is provided via their coupling to the mechanical motion of the ribbon, which in turn stems from the local strain. The coupling strengths are computed by performing ab initio calculations. The density functional theory results for boron vacancy centers on boron nitride monolayers reveal a huge strain susceptibility. In our analysis, we take into account the effect of all flexural modes and show that despite the thermal noise introduced through the vibrations one can achieve steady-state entanglement between two and more number of qubits that survives even at room temperature. Moreover, the entanglement is robust against mis-positioning of the color centers. The effective coupling of color centers is engineered by positioning them in the proper positions. Hence, one is able to tailor stationary graph states. Furthermore, we study the quantum simulation of the Dicke-Ising model and show that the phonon non-equilibrium phase transition occurs even for a finite number of color centers. Given the steady-state nature of the proposed scheme and accessibility of the electronic states through optical fields, our work paves the way for the realization of steady-state quantum information processing with color centers in hBN membranes.

First, the article introduces the main superconducting devices and their fabrication by means of standard lithography techniques such as optical lithography and electron beam lithography. Then, focused ion beam patterning of superconductors through milling or irradiation is shown, as well as the growth of superconducting devices by means of focused electron and ion beam induced deposition. We suggest that the key benefits of these resist-free direct-growth techniques for quantum technologies include the ability to make electrical nanocontacts and circuit edit, fabrication of high-resolution superconducting resonators, creation of Josephson junctions and superconducting quantum interference device (SQUIDs) for on-tip sensors, patterning of high-Tc SQUIDs and other superconducting circuits, and the exploration of fluxtronics and topological superconductivity.

TI QPlayer: Lightweight, scalable, and fast quantum simulator
SO ETRI JOURNAL
AB With the rapid evolution of quantum computing, digital quantum simulations are essential for quantum algorithm verification, quantum error analysis, and new quantum applications. However, the exponential increase in memory overhead and operation time is challenging issues that have not been solved for years. We propose a novel approach that provides more qubits and faster quantum operations with smaller memory than before. Our method selectively tracks realized quantum states using a reduced quantum state representation scheme instead of loading the entire quantum states into memory. This method dramatically reduces memory space ensuring fast quantum computations without compromising the global quantum states. Furthermore, our empirical evaluation reveals that our proposed idea outperforms traditional methods for various algorithms. We verified that the Grover algorithm supports up to 55 qubits and the surface code algorithm supports up to 85 qubits in 512 GB memory on a single computational node, which is against the previous studies that support only between 35 qubits and 49 qubits.

TI Cavity-mediated iSWAP oscillations between distant spins
SO NATURE PHYSICS
AB Direct interactions between quantum particles naturally fall off with distance. However, future quantum computing architectures are likely to require interaction mechanisms between qubits across a range of length scales. In this work, we demonstrate a coherent interaction between two semiconductor spin qubits 250 mu m apart using a superconducting resonator. This separation is several orders of magnitude larger than for the commonly used direct interaction mechanisms in this platform. We operate the system in a regime in which the resonator mediates a spin-spin coupling through virtual photons. We report the anti-phase oscillations of the populations of the two spins with controllable frequency. The observations are consistent with iSWAP oscillations of the spin qubits, and suggest that entangling operations are possible in 10 ns. These results hold promise for scalable networks of spin qubit modules on a chip.

TI Variational Inference with a Quantum Computer
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW APPLIED
AB Inference is the task of drawing conclusions about unobserved variables given observations of related variables. Applications range from identifying diseases from symptoms to classifying economic regimes from price movements. Unfortunately, performing exact inference is intractable in general. One alternative is variational inference, where a candidate probability distribution is optimized to approximate the posterior distribution over unobserved variables. For good approximations, a flexible and highly expressive candidate distribution is desirable. In this work, we use quantum Born machines as variational distributions over discrete variables. We apply the framework of operator variational inference to achieve this goal. In particular, we adopt two specific realizations: one with an adversarial objective and one based on the kernelized Stein discrepancy. We demonstrate the approach numerically using examples of Bayesian networks, and implement an experiment on an IBM quantum computer. Our techniques enable efficient variational inference with distributions beyond those that are efficiently representable on a classical computer.

TI Circuit connectivity boosts by quantum-classical-quantum interfaces
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB High-connectivity circuits are a major roadblock for current quantum hardware. We propose a hybrid classical-quantum algorithm to simulate such circuits without SWAP-gate ladders. As the main technical tool, we introduce quantum-classical-quantum interfaces. These replace an experimentally problematic gate (e.g., a long-range one) with single-qubit random measurements followed by state preparations sampled according to a classical quasiprobability simulation of the noiseless gate. Each interface introduces a multiplicative statistical overhead which, remarkably, is independent of the on-chip qubit distance. Hence, by applying interfaces to the longest-range gates in a target circuit, significant reductions in circuit depth and gate infidelity can be attained. We numerically show the efficacy of our method for a Bell-state circuit for two increasingly distant qubits and a variational ground-state solver for the transverse-field Ising model on a ring. Our findings provide a versatile toolbox for error-mitigation and circuit boosts tailored for noisy, intermediate-scale quantum computation.

TI Security of Bennett-Brassard 1984 Quantum-Key Distribution under a
   Collective-Rotation Noise Channel
SO PHOTONICS
AB The security analysis of the Ekert 1991 (E91), Bennett 1992 (B92), six-state protocol, Scarani-Acin-Ribordy-Gisin 2004 (SARG04) quantum key distribution (QKD) protocols, and their variants have been studied in the presence of collective-rotation noise channels. However, besides the Bennett-Brassard 1984 (BB84) being the first proposed, extensively studied, and essential protocol, its security proof under collective-rotation noise is still missing. Thus, we aim to close this gap in the literature. Consequently, we investigate how collective-rotation noise channels affect the security of the BB84 protocol. Mainly, we study scenarios where the eavesdropper, Eve, conducts an intercept-resend attack on the transmitted photons sent via a quantum communication channel shared by Alice and Bob. Notably, we distinguish the impact of collective-rotation noise and that of the eavesdropper. To achieve this, we provide rigorous, yet straightforward numerical calculations. First, we derive a model for the collective-rotation noise for the BB84 protocol and parametrize the mutual information shared between Alice and Eve. This is followed by deriving the quantum bit error rate (QBER) for two intercept-resend attack scenarios. In particular, we demonstrate that, for small rotation angles, one can extract a secure secret key under a collective-rotation noise channel when there is no eavesdropping. We observe that noise induced by rotation of 0.35 radians of the prepared quantum state results in a QBER of 11%, which corresponds to the lower bound on the tolerable error rate for the BB84 QKD protocol against general attacks. Moreover, a rotational angle of 0.53 radians yields a 25% QBER, which corresponds to the error rate bound due to the intercept-resend attack. Finally, we conclude that the BB84 protocol is robust against intercept-resend attacks on collective-rotation noise channels when the rotation angle is varied arbitrarily within particular bounds.

TI Features of preparable entangled states in Gaussian quantum networks
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Large-scale quantum networks have been employed to overcome practical constraints on transmission and storage for single entangled systems. The deterministic preparation of entangled states is one of the key factors for the realization of quantum networks. There is no efficient method to verify whether single multipartite entanglement can be prepared by multisource quantum networks. Here, we theoretically analyze under what conditions entangled states can be prepared in three kinds of basic Gaussian quantum networks, named triangle networks, star-shaped networks, and chain-type networks. Some necessary criteria are derived for all preparable entangled Gaussian states in such networks. They show that the network structure imposes strong constraints on the set of preparable entangled Gaussian states, which is fundamentally different from standard single multipartite entanglement. This study takes the first step towards understanding the network mechanism for preparing entangled Gaussian states.

TI Experimental Demonstration of Fine-Grained Steering Inequality of
   Two-Qubit Mixed States
SO PHOTONICS
AB Quantum steering, as a cornerstone of quantum information, is usually used to witness the quantum correlation of bipartite and multi-partite states. Here, we experimentally demonstrate the quantum steering inequality of two-qubit mixed states based on the fine-grained uncertainty relation. Our experimental results show that the steering inequality has potent sensitivity to Werner states and Bell diagonal states. The steering strategy exhibits a strong ability to identify that Werner states are steerable when the decoherence coefficient a > 1/2. Compared to the steering inequality obtained by another stratagem, the steering witness criteria of mixed states based on the fine-grained uncertainty relation demonstrated in our experiment has better precision and accuracy. Moreover, the detection efficiency in our measurement setup is only required to be 50% to close the detection loophole, which means our approach needs less detector efficiency to certificate the steerability of mixed states.

AB We give a comprehensive characterisation of the computational power of shallow quantum circuits combined with classical computation. Specifically, for classes of search problems, we show that the following statements hold, relative to a random oracle:
   (a) BPPQNCBPP not equal BQP. This refutes Jozsa's conjecturein the random oracle model. As a result, this gives the first instantiatable separation between the classes by replacing the oracle with a cryptographic hash function, yielding a resolution to one of Aaronson's ten semi-grand challenges in quantum computing.
   (b) BPPQNC not subset of QNC(BPP) and QNC(BPP) not subset of BPPQNC. This shows that there is a subtle interplay between classical computation and shallow quantum computation. In fact, for the second separation, we establish that, for some problems, the ability to perform adaptive measurements in a single shallow quantum circuit, is more useful than the ability to perform polynomially many shallow quantum circuits without adaptive measurements. We also show that BPPQNC and QNC(BPP) are both strictly contained in BPPQNCBPP.
   (c) There exists a 2-message proof of quantum depth protocol. Such a protocol allows a classical verifier to efficiently certify that a prover must be performing a computation of some minimum quantum depth. Our proof of quantum depth can be instantiated using the recent proof of quantumness by Yamakawa and Zhandry.

TI Towards global quantum key distribution
SO NATURE REVIEWS ELECTRICAL ENGINEERING
AB Quantum key distribution (QKD) is a cryptographic technology that supports the negotiation and sharing of private keys with unconditional security between authorized parties. As QKD scales to a global level, it must address performance limitations, high costs and practical security concerns. In this Review, we outline the key technical challenges, applications and prospective developments towards a global QKD network. Advances such as satellite-based QKD and newly developed protocols offer promising solutions for extending QKD over long distances. Field trials have progressively expanded from intercity links to larger-scale networks. Nevertheless, balancing cost-performance and security considerations will continue to challenge advanced research efforts. On the basis of the strategies addressing these obstacles, we highlight future directions that can support the efficient realization of global QKD infrastructures.

TI Quantum nanophotonic and nanoplasmonic sensing: towards quantum optical
   bioscience laboratories on chip
SO NANOPHOTONICS
AB Quantum-enhanced sensing and metrology pave the way for promising routes to fulfil the present day fundamental and technological demands for integrated chips which surpass the classical functional and measurement limits. The most precise measurements of optical properties such as phase or intensity require quantum optical measurement schemes. These non-classical measurements exploit phenomena such as entanglement and squeezing of optical probe states. They are also subject to lower detection limits as compared to classical photo-detection schemes. Biosensing with non-classical light sources of entangled photons or squeezed light holds the key for realizing quantum optical bioscience laboratories which could be integrated on chip. Single-molecule sensing with such non-classical sources of light would be a forerunner to attaining the smallest uncertainty and the highest information per photon number. This demands an integrated non-classical sensing approach which would combine the subtle non-deterministic measurement techniques of quantum optics with the device-level integration capabilities attained through nanophotonics as well as nanoplasmonics. In this back drop, we review the underlining principles in quantum sensing, the quantum optical probes and protocols as well as state-of-the-art building blocks in quantum optical sensing. We further explore the recent developments in quantum photonic/plasmonic sensing and imaging together with the potential of combining them with burgeoning field of coupled cavity integrated optoplasmonic biosensing platforms.

Numerical simulations and analytical estimations are presented to illustrate the feasibility of this proposal with current technology. The proposed approach is fully scalable to a larger number of sites. The use of a quantum correlation function as a probe to explore the quantum phases by quantum simulating the time dynamics, with no need of computing the ground state, is also studied. Evidence is given showing that the amplitude of the time dynamics of a correlation function in this quantum simulation is linked to the different quantum phases of the system.

TI Nondestructive detection of photonic qubits
SO NATURE
AB One of the biggest challenges in experimental quantum information is to sustain the fragile superposition state of a qubit(1). Long lifetimes can be achieved for material qubit carriers as memories(2), at least in principle, but not for propagating photons that are rapidly lost by absorption, diffraction or scattering(3). The loss problem can be mitigated with a nondestructive photonic qubit detector that heralds the photon without destroying the encoded qubit. Such a detector is envisioned to facilitate protocols in which distributed tasks depend on the successful dissemination of photonic qubits(4,5), improve loss-sensitive qubit measurements(6,7) and enable certain quantum key distribution attacks(8). Here we demonstrate such a detector based on a single atom in two crossed fibre-based optical resonators, one for qubit-insensitive atom-photon coupling and the other for atomic-state detection(9). We achieve a nondestructive detection efficiency upon qubit survival of 79 +/- 3 per cent and a photon survival probability of 31 +/- 1 per cent, and we preserve the qubit information with a fidelity of 96.2 +/- 0.3 per cent. To illustrate the potential of our detector, we show that it can, with the current parameters, improve the rate and fidelity of long-distance entanglement and quantum state distribution compared to previous methods, provide resource optimization via qubit amplification and enable detection-loophole-free Bell tests.

TI Quantum Feasibility Labeling for NP-Complete Vertex Coloring Problem
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB Many important science and engineering problems can be converted into NP-complete problems which are of significant importance in computer science and mathematics. Currently, neither existing classical nor quantum algorithms can solve these problems in polynomial time. To address this difficulty, this paper proposes a quantum feasibility labeling (QFL) algorithm to label all possible solutions to the vertex coloring problem, which is a well-known NP-complete problem. The QFL algorithm converts the vertex coloring problem into the problem of searching an unstructured database where good and bad elements are labeled. The recently proposed variational quantum search (VQS) algorithm was demonstrated to achieve an exponential speedup, in circuit depth, up to 26 qubits in finding good element(s) from an unstructured database. Using the labels and the associated possible solutions as input, the VQS can find all feasible solutions to the vertex coloring problem. The number of qubits and the circuit depth required by the QFL each is a polynomial function of the number of vertices, the number of edges, and the number of colors of a vertex coloring problem. We have implemented the QFL on an IBM Qiskit simulator to solve a 4-colorable 4-vertex 3-edge coloring problem.

TI Fermionic wave packet scattering: a quantum computing approach
SO QUANTUM
AB Quantum computing provides a novel avenue towards simulating dynamical phenomena, and, in particular, scattering processes relevant for exploring the structure of matter. However, preparing and evolving particle wave packets on a quantum device is a nontrivial task. In this work, we propose a method to prepare Gaussian wave packets with momentum on top of the interacting ground state of a fermionic Hamiltonian. Using Givens rotation, we show how to efficiently obtain expectation values of observables throughout the evolution of the wave packets on digital quantum computers. We demonstrate our technique by applying it to the staggered lattice formulation of the Thirring model and studying the scattering of two wave packets. Monitoring the particle density and the entropy produced during the scattering process, we characterize the phenomenon and provide a first step towards studying more complicated collision processes on digital quantum computers. In addition, we perform a small-scale demonstration on IBM's quantum hardware, showing that our method is suitable for current and near-term quantum devices.

TI Fault-tolerant fusing of repeater graph states and its application
SO QUANTUM SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB A repeater graph state (RGS) is a class of multipartite entangled states with favourable features for quantum communication, particularly as the enabler of all-photonic quantum repeaters. In this paper, based on an alternative formalism, we show that two RGSs can be fused via a Bell measurement in a fault-tolerant manner. The fusing of multiple RGSs can thus be carried out simultaneously and flexibly, which enables a 2-step rapid generation of an arbitrarily large RGS from relatively small building blocks using heralded but non-deterministic photonic Bell measurements. It then makes possible the distribution of a large multipartite entangled state from multiple sources to many parties via high-loss channels, and hence also a satellite-based entanglement distribution scheme. In such a scheme, stationary memories are only required for ground stations, the growth of memory noise with its scale can be effectively suppressed, and recipients of entangled pairs of qubits may remain anonymous.

TI QCRAFT AutoScheduler: A library for maximizing qubit utilization on QPUs
   through quantum circuit multiprogramming
SO SOFTWAREX
AB Quantum computing is emerging as a technology with the potential to solve complex problems in areas such as optimization, cryptography, and simulation beyond the capabilities of classical computers. Cloud-based quantum platforms have made quantum hardware accessible to researchers and developers worldwide. However, current usage models still face important limitations. Despite growing demand, quantum computers often remain under-utilized, as tasks are executed sequentially, blocking all available qubits regardless of their actual usage. This leads to long queue times, high execution costs, and inefficient resource utilization. To address these problems, the following paper presents QCRAFT AutoScheduler, a Python-based programming library that optimizes the use of Quantum Processing Units (QPUs). The proposed library automatically multiprograms a quantum circuit with multiple copies of itself until it reaches or approaches the maximum capacity of the processor. By multiprogramming circuits, the approach reduces idle qubits, reducing execution costs and reducing the number of required shots. To demonstrate these advantages, QCRAFT AutoScheduler has been validated on different real quantum computers provided by IBM Quantum and Amazon Braket. The obtained results demonstrate the effectiveness of this tool to improve resource utilization in quantum computing, obtaining an average shot reduction of 85% and 96% in AWS and IBM executions respectively.

AB Quantum computing is a growing field that promises many real-world applications such as quantum cryptography or quantum finance. The number of people able to use quantum computing is however still very small. This limitation comes from the difficulty to understand the concepts and to know how to start coding. Therefore, there is a need for tools that can assist non-expert in overcoming this complexity. One possibility would be to use existing conversational agents. Unfortunately ChatGPT and other Large-Language Models produce inaccurate results.
   This article presents C4Q, a chatbot that answers accurately basic questions and guides users when trying to code quantum programs. Contrary to other approaches C4Q uses a pre-trained large language model only to discover and classify user requests. It then generates an accurate answer using an own engine. Thanks to this architectural design, C4Q's answers are always correct, and thus C4Q can become a support tool that makes quantum computing more available to non-experts.

TI Bypassing the Kochen-Specker Theorem: An Explicit Non-Contextual
   Statistical Model for the Qutrit
SO AXIOMS
AB We describe an explicitly non-contextual statistical model of hidden variables for the qutrit, which fully reproduces the predictions of quantum mechanics, and thus, bypasses the constraints imposed by the Kochen-Specker theorem and its subsequent reformulations. We notice that these renowned theorems crucially rely on the implicitly assumed existence of an absolute frame of reference with respect to which physically indistinguishable tests related by spurious gauge transformations can supposedly be assigned well-defined distinct identities. We observe that the existence of such an absolute frame of reference is not required by fundamental physical principles, and hence, assuming it is an unnecessarily restrictive demand.

TI Efficient Circuit Implementations of Continuous-Time Quantum Walks for
   Quantum Search
SO ENTROPY
AB Quantum walks are a powerful framework for simulating complex quantum systems and designing quantum algorithms, particularly for spatial search on graphs, where the goal is to find a marked vertex efficiently. In this work, we present efficient quantum circuits that implement the evolution operator of continuous-time quantum-walk-based search algorithms for three graph families: complete graphs, complete bipartite graphs, and hypercubes. For complete and complete bipartite graphs, our circuits exactly implement the evolution operator. For hypercubes, we propose an approximate implementation that closely matches the exact evolution operator as the number of vertices increases. Our Qiskit simulations demonstrate that even for low-dimensional hypercubes, the algorithm effectively identifies the marked vertex. Furthermore, the approximate implementation developed for hypercubes can be extended to a broad class of graphs, enabling efficient quantum search in scenarios where exact implementations are impractical.

TI Distributed quantum sensing with optical lattices
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB In distributed quantum sensing the correlations between multiple modes, typically of a photonic system, are utilized to enhance the measurement precision of an unknown parameter. In this work, we investigate the metrological potential of a multimode, tilted Bose-Hubbard system and show that it can allow for parameter estimation at the Heisenberg limit of [N(M - 1)T ]2, where N is the number of particles, M is the number of modes, and T is the measurement time. The quadratic dependence on the number of modes can be used to increase the precision compared to typical metrological systems with only two atomic modes and does not require correlations between different modes. We show that the limit can be reached by using an optimized initial state given as the superposition of all the atoms occupying the first and last sites. Subsequently, we present strategies that would allow us to obtain quadratic dependence on M of the Fisher information in a more realistic experimental setup.

TI Advances in Modeling of Noisy Quantum Computers: Spin Qubits in
   Semiconductor Quantum Dots
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB The new quantum era is expected to have an unprecedented social impact, enabling the research of tomorrow in several pivotal fields. These perspectives require a physical system able to encode, process and store for a sufficiently long amount of time the quantum information. However, the optimal engineering of currently available quantum computers, which are small and flawed by several non-ideal phenomena, requires an efficacious methodology for exploring the design space. Hence, there is an unmet need for the development of reliable hardware-aware simulation infrastructures able to efficiently emulate the behaviour of quantum hardware that commits to looking for innovative systematic ways, with a bottom-up approach starting from the physical level, moving to the device level and up to the system level. This article discusses the development of a classical simulation infrastructure for semiconductor quantum-dot quantum computation based on compact models, where each device is described in terms of the main physical parameters affecting its performance in a sufficiently easy way from a computational point of view for providing accurate results without involving sophisticated physical simulators, thus reducing the requirements on CPU and memory. The effectiveness of the involved approximations is tested on a benchmark of quantum circuits - in the expected operating ranges of quantum hardware - by comparing the corresponding outcomes with those obtained via numeric integration of the Schrodinger equation. The achieved results give evidence that this work is a step forward towards the definition of a classical simulator of quantum computers.

TI Continuous-variable quantum key distribution at 10 GBaud using an
   integrated photonic-electronic receiver
SO OPTICA
AB Quantum key distribution (QKD) is a widely recognized application of quantum information theory, guaranteeing information-theoretically secure key exchange. However, commercial viability of QKD systems is currently impeded by issues such as scalability, network integration, and high manufacturing costs. Low-cost, high-volume production of photonic and electronic integrated circuits could be the breakthrough needed for broad-scale deployment of cutting-edge QKD systems. Here, we present a continuous-variable (CV) QKD system that is based on an integrated photonic-electronic receiver. It combines a silicon photonic integrated circuit, featuring a phase-diverse receiver, with custom-designed GaAs pHEMT transimpedance amplifiers. Operating at a classical telecom symbol rate of 10 GBaud, our QKD system generates high secret key rates- exceeding 0.7 Gb/s over a 5 km distance and 0.3 Gb/s over a 10 km. The secret keys are secure against collective attacks, even when accounting for finite-size effects in the parameter estimation, thanks to well-designed digital signal processing that enables broadband system operation. Our experiment sets a record for secure key exchange and paves the way for the implementation of real-time broadband CV-QKD systems.

TI Quantum walks on random lattices: Diffusion, localization, and the
   absence of parametric quantum speedup
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Discrete-time quantum walks, quantum generalizations of classical random walks, provide a framework for quantum information processing, quantum algorithms, and quantum simulation of condensed-matter systems. The key property of quantum walks, which lies at the heart of their quantum information applications, is the possibility for a parametric quantum speedup in propagation compared to classical random walks. In this work we study propagation of quantum walks on percolation-generated two-dimensional random lattices. In large-scale simulations of topological and trivial split-step walks, we identify distinct prediffusive and diffusive behaviors at different timescales. Importantly, we show that even arbitrarily weak concentrations of randomly removed lattice sites give rise to a complete breakdown of the superdiffusive quantum speedup, reducing the motion to ordinary diffusion. By increasing the randomness, quantum walks eventually stop spreading due to Anderson localization. Near the localization threshold, we find that the quantum walks become subdiffusive. The fragility of quantum speedup implies dramatic limitations for quantum information applications of quantum walks on random geometries and graphs.

TI Matter-wave squeezing from Gouy phase: toward a new tool for quantum
   technology
SO NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB We investigate the Gouy phase emerging from the time evolution of confined matter waves in a harmonic potential. Specifically, we analyze the quantum dynamics of a Gaussian wavepacket that exhibits position-momentum correlations. By tuning the parameters governing its evolution, we reveal intriguing effects, with a particular focus on squeezing. Notably, during the wavepacket evolution quantum spreading and squeezing processes emerge, giving rise to Gouy phase contributions of pi/4rad, establishing a clear link between the Gouy phase and a purely quantum phenomenon. Furthermore, the interplay between wavepacket squeezing and one-dimensional spreading leads to a total Gouy phase accumulation of pi/2rad in an oscillation period. Both squeezing and Gouy phase have individually proven valuable in state engineering and quantum metrology. By demonstrating a direct, controllable relationship between these two fundamental processes, our findings expand the realm of quantum-enhanced technologies, including quantum sensing and precision measurement.

TI Deterministic distribution of orbital angular momentum multiplexed
   continuous-variable entanglement and quantum steering
SO PHOTONICS RESEARCH
AB Orbital angular momentum (OAM) multiplexing provides an efficient method to improve data-carrying capacity in various quantum communication protocols. It is a precondition to distribute OAM multiplexed quantum resources in quantum channels for implementing quantum communication. However, quantum steering of OAM multiplexed optical fields and the effect of channel noise on OAM multiplexed quantum resources remain unclear. Here, we generate OAM multiplexed continuous-variable (CV) entangled states and distribute them in lossy or noisy channels. We show that the decoherence property of entanglement and quantum steering of the OAM multiplexed states carrying topological charges l = 1 and l = 2 are the same as that of the Gaussian mode with l = 0 in lossy and noisy channels. The sudden death of entanglement and quantum steering of high-order OAM multiplexed states is observed in the presence of excess noise. Our results demonstrate the feasibility to realize high data-carrying capacity quantum information processing by utilizing OAM multiplexed CV entangled states. (C) 2022 Chinese Laser Press

TI Dynamic generation of photonic spatial quantum states with an all-fiber
   platform
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB Photonic spatial quantum states are a subject of great interest for applications in quantum communication. One important challenge has been how to dynamically generate these states using only fiber-optical components. Here we propose and experimentally demonstrate an all-fiber system that can dynamically switch between any general transverse spatial qubit state based on linearly polarized modes. Our platform is based on a fast optical switch based on a Sagnac interferometer combined with a photonic lantern and few-mode optical fibers. We show switching times between spatial modes on the order of 5 ns and demonstrate the applicability of our scheme for quantum technologies by demonstrating a measurement-device-independent (MDI) quantum random number generator based on our platform. We run the generator continuously over 15 hours, acquiring over 13.46 Gbits of random numbers, of which we ensure that at least 60.52% are private, following the MDI protocol. Our results show the use of photonic lanterns to dynamically create spatial modes using only fiber components, which due to their robustness and integration capabilities, have important consequences for photonic classical and quantum information processing.(c) 2023 Optica Publishing Group under the terms of the Optica Open Access Publishing Agreement

TI Leveraging Different Boolean Function Decompositions to Reduce T-Count
   in LUT-Based Quantum Circuit Synthesis
SO IEICE TRANSACTIONS ON INFORMATION AND SYSTEMS
AB Lookup Table (LUT) based synthesis methods have recently been proposed as a way to synthesize quantum Boolean circuits in a qubit-constrained environment. Other recent research papers have demonstrated the possibility of using relative phase quantum circuits when compute/uncompute logic is used in tandem, reducing T-count in quantum Boolean circuits in the fault-tolerant quantum computing paradigm. Because LUT-based synthesis methods use compute/uncompute pairs on ancilla qubits, this suggests that implementing the arbitrary Boolean logic that make up the individual Boolean logic network nodes in a relative phase manner could reduce the T-count. To generate such arbitrary Boolean functions, we utilize Shannon's decomposition, Davio expansions, as well as alternating balanced and unbalanced relative phase circuits. Experimental results demonstrate that our method can reduce the T-count to an average of 24% of the existing method.

TI Fibonacci Anyons Versus Majorana Fermions: A Monte Carlo Approach to the
   Compilation of Braid Circuits in SU(2)k Anyon Models
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB We study SU(2)(k) anyon models, assessing their prospects for topological quantum computation. In particular, we compare the Ising (k = 2) anyon and Fibonacci (k = 3) anyon models, motivated by their potential for future realizations based on Majorana fermion quasiparticles or exotic fractional quantum Hall states, respectively. The quantum computational performance of the different anyon models is quantified at the single-qubit level by the difference between a target unitary operator and its approximation realized by anyon braiding. To facilitate efficient comparisons, we develop a Monte Carlo enhanced Solovay-Kitaev quantum compiler algorithm that finds near-optimal braid words in polynomial time from the exponentially large search tree. Since universal quantum computation cannot be achieved within the Ising anyon model by braiding alone, we introduce an additional elementary phase gate to model a non-topological measurement process, which restores universality of the anyon model at the cost of breaking the full topological protection. We model conventional kinds of decoherence processes algorithmically by introducing a controllable noise term to all nontopological gate operations. We find that, for reasonable levels of decoherence, even the hybrid Ising anyon model retains a significant topological advantage over a conventional, nontopological, quantum computer. Furthermore, we find that only surprisingly short anyon braids are ever required to be compiled due to the gate noise exceeding the intrinsic error of the braid words already for word lengths of the order of 100 elementary braids. We conclude that the future for hybrid topological quantum computation remains promising.

TI Quantum process tomography of the single-shot entangling gate with

SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICS B-ATOMIC MOLECULAR AND OPTICAL PHYSICS
AB A single-shot entangling gate plays a crucial role in quantum information processing due to its high fidelity. This operation gate is fast to create a maximally entangled state and forms a universal gate set for quantum computing. Currently, the preparation and demonstration of multi-qubit entanglement are achieved based on sequences of single- and two-qubit operations, yielding lower fidelity and requiring longer execution time. Here, we demonstrate by numerically simulating the use of quantum process tomography to fully characterize the performance of a single-shot three-qubit entangling gate. This gate is used to create a Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger entangled state in Sakhouf et al (2021 J. Phys. B: At. Mol. Opt. Phys. 54 175501), directly generated by three transmon-type superconducting qubits which are mediated by a resonator with the assistance of a microwave field. Comparing ideal and simulated quantum process tomography, we characterize the entangling gate performance by calculating the mean fidelity achieving a high value >0.93

SO EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB Quantum information science is a rapidly growing interdisciplinary field that is attracting the attention of academics and industry experts alike. It requires talent from a wide variety of traditional fields, including physics, engineering, chemistry, and computer science, to name a few. To prepare students for such opportunities, it is important to give them a strong foundation in the basics of quantum information science, in which quantum computing plays a central role. In this study, we discuss the development, validation, and evaluation of a tutorial on the Bloch sphere, a useful visual tool for developing intuition about single quantum bits (qubits), which are the basic building block of any quantum computer. Students' understanding was evaluated after they received traditional lecture-based instruction on the requisite topics, and again after engaging with the tutorial. We observe, analyze, and discuss their improvement in performance on concepts covered in the tutorial.

TI Formation and Microwave Losses of Hydrides in Superconducting Niobium
   Thin Films Resulting from Fluoride Chemical Processing
SO ADVANCED FUNCTIONAL MATERIALS
AB Superconducting niobium (Nb) thin films have recently attracted significant attention due to their utility for quantum information technologies. In the processing of Nb thin films, fluoride-based chemical etchants are commonly used to remove surface oxides that are known to affect superconducting quantum devices adversely. However, these same etchants can also introduce hydrogen to form Nb hydrides, potentially negatively impacting microwave loss performance. Here, comprehensive materials characterization of Nb hydrides formed in Nb thin films as a function of fluoride chemical treatments is presented. In particular, secondary-ion mass spectrometry, X-ray scattering, and transmission electron microscopy reveal the spatial distribution and phase transformation of Nb hydrides. The rate of hydride formation is determined by the fluoride solution acidity and the etch rate of Nb2O5, which acts as a diffusion barrier for hydrogen into Nb. The resulting Nb hydrides are detrimental to Nb superconducting properties and lead to increased power-independent microwave loss in coplanar waveguide resonators. However, Nb hydrides do not correlate with two-level system loss or device aging mechanisms. Overall, this work provides insight into the formation of Nb hydrides and their role in microwave loss, thus guiding ongoing efforts to maximize coherence time in superconducting quantum devices.

TI On-Chip Detection of Electronuclear Transitions in the
   155,157Gd Multilevel Spin System
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW APPLIED
AB The properties of rare-earth elements diluted in nonmagnetic crystals make them promising candidates for a quantum memory due to their limited Hilbert space. The control and readout of the qubit states require a highly sensitive measurement and large coupling of the spin ensemble with the electromagnetic mode of a superconducting resonator. We report sensitive detection of forbidden transitions of electronuclear states from the minority species of Gd-155 and Gd-157 isotopes, which opens the possibility of connecting quantum states with very different spin projections. Cavity perturbation measurements seen in the reflected signal allow the detection of about 7.6 x 10(7) spins and the measurement of phase memory loss rate and spin-photon coupling strength.

TI Phonon downconversion to suppress correlated errors in superconducting
   qubits
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Quantum error correction can preserve quantum information in the presence of local errors, but correlated errors are fatal. For superconducting qubits, high-energy particle impacts from background radioactivity produce energetic phonons that travel throughout the substrate and create excitations above the superconducting ground state, known as quasiparticles, which can poison all qubits on the chip. We use normal metal reservoirs on the chip back side to downconvert phonons to low energies where they can no longer poison qubits. We introduce a pump-probe scheme involving controlled injection of pair-breaking phonons into the qubit chips. We examine quasiparticle poisoning on chips with and without back-side metallization and demonstrate a reduction in the flux of pair-breaking phonons by over a factor of 20. We use a Ramsey interferometer scheme to simultaneously monitor quasiparticle parity on three qubits for each chip and observe a two-order of magnitude reduction in correlated poisoning due to background radiation.
   High-energy particle impacts due to background or cosmic radiation have been identified as sources of correlated errors in superconducting qubit arrays. Iaia et al. achieve a suppression of correlated error rate by channeling the energy away from the qubits via a thick metal layer at the bottom of the chip.

TI Distributed quantum sensing of multiple phases with fewer photons
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Distributed quantum metrology has drawn intense interest as it outperforms the optimal classical counterparts in estimating multiple distributed parameters. However, most schemes so far have required entangled resources consisting of photon numbers equal to or more than the parameter numbers, which is a fairly demanding requirement as the number of nodes increases. Here, we present a distributed quantum sensing scenario in which quantum-enhanced sensitivity can be achieved with fewer photons than the number of parameters. As an experimental demonstration, using a two-photon entangled state, we estimate four phases distributed 3 km away from the central node, resulting in a 2.2 dB sensitivity enhancement from the standard quantum limit. Our results show that the Heisenberg scaling can be achieved even when using fewer photons than the number of parameters. We believe our scheme will open a pathway to perform large-scale distributed quantum sensing with currently available entangled sources.
   Enhanced sensitivity is a key parameter in quantum metrology. Here the authors demonstrate a distributed quantum phase sensing method that uses fewer photons than the number of parameters needed, and an enhanced quantum sensitivity is achieved.

TI Federated quanvolutional neural network: a new paradigm for
   collaborative quantum learning
SO QUANTUM SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB In recent years, the concept of federated machine learning has been actively driven by scientists to ease the privacy concerns of data owners. Currently, the combination of machine learning and quantum computing technologies is a hot industry topic and is positioned to be a major disruptor. It has become an effective new tool for reshaping several industries ranging from healthcare to finance. Data sharing poses a significant hurdle for large-scale machine learning in numerous industries. It is a natural goal to study the advanced quantum computing ecosystem, which will be comprised of heterogeneous federated resources. In this work, the problem of data governance and privacy is handled by developing a quantum federated learning approach, that can be efficiently executed on quantum hardware in the noisy intermediate-scale quantum era. We present the federated hybrid quantum-classical algorithm called a quanvolutional neural network with distributed training on different sites without exchanging data. The hybrid algorithm requires small quantum circuits to produce meaningful features for image classification tasks, which makes it ideal for near-term quantum computing. The primary goal of this work is to evaluate the potential benefits of hybrid quantum-classical and classical-quantum convolutional neural networks on non-independently and non-identically partitioned (Non-IID) and real-world data partitioned datasets among several healthcare institutions/clients. We investigated the performance of a collaborative quanvolutional neural network on two medical machine learning datasets, COVID-19 and MedNIST. Extensive experiments are carried out to validate the robustness and feasibility of the proposed quantum federated learning framework. Our findings demonstrate a decrease of 2%-39% times in necessary communication rounds compared to the federated stochastic gradient descent approach. The hybrid federated framework maintained a high classification testing accuracy and generalizability, even in scenarios where the medical data is unevenly distributed among clients.

TI Artificially intelligent Maxwell's demon for optimal control of open
   quantum systems
SO QUANTUM SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB Feedback control of open quantum systems is of fundamental importance for practical applications in various contexts, ranging from quantum computation to quantum error correction and quantum metrology. Its use in the context of thermodynamics further enables the study of the interplay between information and energy. However, deriving optimal feedback control strategies is highly challenging, as it involves the optimal control of open quantum systems, the stochastic nature of quantum measurement, and the inclusion of policies that maximize a long-term time- and trajectory-averaged goal. In this work, we employ a reinforcement learning approach to automate and capture the role of a quantum Maxwell's demon: the agent takes the literal role of discovering optimal feedback control strategies in qubit-based systems that maximize a trade-off between measurement-powered cooling and measurement efficiency. Considering weak or projective quantum measurements, we explore different regimes based on the ordering between the thermalization, the measurement, and the unitary feedback timescales, finding different and highly non-intuitive, yet interpretable, strategies. In the thermalization-dominated regime, we find strategies with elaborate finite-time thermalization protocols conditioned on measurement outcomes. In the measurement-dominated regime, we find that optimal strategies involve adaptively measuring different qubit observables reflecting the acquired information, and repeating multiple weak measurements until the quantum state is 'sufficiently pure', leading to random walks in state space. Finally, we study the case when all timescales are comparable, finding new feedback control strategies that considerably outperform more intuitive ones. We discuss a two-qubit example where we explore the role of entanglement and conclude discussing the scaling of our results to quantum many-body systems.

TI Quantum repetition codes as building blocks of large-period discrete
   time crystals
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
AB Discrete time crystals (DTCs) are nonequilibrium phases of matter with exotic observable dynamics. Among their remarkable features is their response to a periodic drive at a fraction of its frequency. Current successful experiments are, however, only limited to realizing DTCs with period-doubling and period-tripling observable dynamics, forming only a very small subset of DTC phases. Creating larger periodic DTCs in the laboratory remains a longstanding challenge, yet it is necessary for developing the technological applications of DTCs, e.g., as a quantum memory for highly entangled qubits, or exploring interesting features beyond subharmonic dynamics, e.g., condensed matter phenomena in the time domain. By highlighting the connection between DTCs and quantum error correction, we devise a general and realistic scheme for building DTCs exhibiting any largeperiod observable dynamics, which are observable even at sufficiently small system sizes. Our proposal uses an array of spin-1/2 chains to simulate a repetition code at the hardware level, which has essential properties to realize robust observable dynamics. It is readily implemented with existing superconducting or trapped-ion quantum processors, making new families of DTCs experimentally accessible in the immediate future.

TI Broadband uniform-efficiency OAM-mode detector
SO SCIENCE ADVANCES
AB The high-dimensional basis of orbital angular momentum (OAM) has several added and unique advantages for photonic quantum technologies compared to the polarization basis, which is only two-dimensional. However, one of the major roadblocks in implementing OAM-based applications with their full potentials is the absence of an ideal OAM-mode detector. Despite the plethora of efforts in the last three decades, currently, there is no OAM detector that can detect a broad OAM-mode spectrum, has uniform detection-efficiency over all the modes, measures the true spectrum, and works for an arbitrary quantum state without the need for any previous information. Here, we experimentally demonstrate just such an OAM detector. We report detection of pure and mixed OAM states with fidelities more than 98% and with measurement times of only a few minutes for dimensionalities up to 100. We expect our work to substantially boost the OAM-based photonic quantum technology efforts.

TI Block Lanczos method for excited states on a quantum computer
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB The method of quantum Lanczos recursion is extended to solve for multiple excitations on the quantum computer. While quantum Lanczos recursion is, in principle, capable of obtaining excitations, the extension to a block Lanczos routine can resolve degeneracies with better precision and only costs O(d2) ford excitations on top of the previously introduced quantum Lanczos recursion method. Extension to non-Hermitian operators is also discussed.

TI DeepQPrep: Neural Network Augmented Search for Quantum State Preparation
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB There is an increasing interest in the area of quantum computing but developing quantum algorithms is difficult. Neural Network augmented search algorithms have proven quite successful for general search problems (like program generation) but current approaches to quantum program generation make very restricted use of them. In this paper we present DeepQPrep, a Neural Network based approach to generate quantum circuits for state preparation; a common yet expensive task needed in many applications of quantum computing. We illustrate that Neural Network augmented search algorithms have significant promise for automated quantum program generation; DeepQPrep generated programs were able to solve 99% and 76.9% of 20000 previously unseen state prepartion tasks in a supervised machine learning context within two different application scenarios. The circuits produced by DeepQPrep are also shallower (on average) than their ground truth counterparts. We also compare DeepQPrep to IBM Qiskit's approach to state preparation and illustrate that even when constrained, DeepQPrep generates significantly shallower circuits despite Qiskit solving more of the state preparation tasks. Based on our results, we argue that neural network augmented search approaches exhibit significant promise for generalised approaches to quantum program induction warranting further study in more complex scenarios.

TI Resource theory of unextendibility and nonasymptotic quantum capacity
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB In this paper, we introduce the resource theory of unextendibility as a relaxation of the resource theory of entanglement. The free states in this resource theory are the k-extendible states, associated with the inability to extend quantum entanglement in a given quantum state to multiple parties. The free channels are k-extendible channels, which preserve the class of k-extendible states. We define several quantifiers of unextendibility by means of generalized divergences and establish their properties. By utilizing this resource theory, we obtain nonasymptotic upper bounds on the rate at which quantum communication or entanglement preservation is possible over a finite number of uses of an arbitrary quantum channel assisted by k-extendible channels at no cost. These bounds are significantly tighter than previously known bounds for both the depolarizing and erasure channels. Finally, we revisit the pretty strong converse for the quantum capacity of antidegradable channels and establish an upper bound on the nonasymptotic quantum capacity of these channels.

TI Community dynamics and knowledge production: forty years of research in
   quantum computing
SO JOURNAL OF KNOWLEDGE MANAGEMENT
AB PurposeThis study aims to explore the interplay between community dynamics and knowledge production using the quantum computing research field as a case study. Quantum computing holds the promise of dramatically increasing computation speed and solving problems that are currently unsolvable in a short space of time. In this highly dynamic area of innovation, computer companies, research laboratories and governments are racing to develop the field. Design/methodology/approachAfter constructing temporal co-authorship networks, the authors identify seven different events affecting communities of researchers, which they label: forming, growing, splitting, shrinking, continuing, merging, dissolving. The authors then extract keywords from the titles and abstracts of their contributions to characterize the dynamics of knowledge production and examine the relationship between community events and knowledge production over time. FindingsThe findings show that forming and splitting are associated with retaining in memory what is currently known, merging and growing with the creation of new knowledge and splitting, shrinking and dissolving with the curation of knowledge. Originality/valueAlthough the link between communities and knowledge has long been established, much less is known about the relationship between the dynamics of communities and their link with collective cognitive processes. To the best of the authors' knowledge, the present contribution is one of the first to shed light on this dynamic aspect of community knowledge production.

TI Triplet-mediated spin entanglement between organic radicals: integrating
   first principles and open-quantum-system simulations
SO NPG ASIA MATERIALS
AB Controlling molecular spin quantum bits optically offers the potential to effectively reduce decoherence and raise the working temperature of quantum computers. Here, exchange interactions and spin dynamics, as mediated by an optically driven triplet state, are calculated for a molecule that consists of a pair of radicals and represents a potential quantum-circuit building block. Consistent with the previous experimental observation of spin coherence induced by the triplet state, our work demonstrates an optically driven quantum gate operation scheme in a molecule. A technological blueprint combining a two-dimensional molecular network and programmable nanophotonics, both of which are sufficiently developed, is proposed. We thus realize computational exploration of chemical databases to identify suitable candidates for molecular spin quantum bits and couplers to be hybridized with nanophotonic devices. The work presented here is proposed to realize a new approach for exploring molecular excited states and click chemistry, toward advancing molecular quantum technology.
   Controlling molecular spin quantum bits optically could help us reduce decoherence and raise the working temperature of quantum computing. Here we show theoretically exchange interactions and spin dynamics could be mediated by optically driven triplet state, leading to quantum gate operations. This indicates a great potential for radical as molecular building block for quantum circuits. A molecular quantum architecture, combining molecular network and nano-photonics, was also proposed. We thus expect the computational exploration of chemical database for molecular quantum computing. This work would therefore open up a new direction to use optical instruments and 'Click Chemistry' towards molecular quantum technology.

TI Experimental realization of a quantum image classifier via
   tensor-network-based machine learning
SO PHOTONICS RESEARCH
AB Quantum machine learning aspires to overcome intractability that currently limits its applicability to practical applications. However, quantum machine learning itself is limited by low effective dimensions achievable in stateof-the-art experiments. Here, we demonstrate highly successful classifications of real-life images using photonic qubits, combining a quantum tensor-network representation of hand-written digits and entanglement-based optimization. Specifically, we focus on binary classification for hand-written zeroes and ones, whose features are cast into the tensor-network representation, further reduced by optimization based on entanglement entropy and encoded into two-qubit photonic states. We then demonstrate image classification with a high success rate exceeding 98%, through successive gate operations and projective measurements. Although we work with photons, our approach is amenable to other physical realizations such as nitrogen-vacancy centers, nuclear spins, and trapped ions, and our scheme can be scaled to efficient multi-qubit encodings of features in the tensor-product representation, thereby setting the stage for quantum-enhanced multi-class classification.

TI Efficient semiquantum key distribution based on single photons in both
   polarization and spatial-mode degrees of freedom
SO QUANTUM INFORMATION PROCESSING
AB In this paper, we propose an efficient semiquantum key distribution (SQKD) protocol which is based on single photons in both polarization and spatial-mode degrees of freedom. This protocol is feasible for a quantum communicant distributing a random private key to a classical communicant. This protocol need not require the classical communicant to use any quantum memory or unitary operation equipment. We validate the complete robustness of the transmissions of single photons between two communicants. It turns out that during these transmissions, if Eve wants not to be detected by two communicants, she will obtain nothing useful about the final shared key bits. Compared with Boyer et al.'s famous pioneering SQKD protocol (Phys Rev Lett 99:140501, 2007), this protocol has double quantum communication capacity, as one single photon with two degrees of freedom for generating the key bits can carry two private bits; and this protocol has higher quantum communication efficiency, as it consumes less qubits for establishing a private key of the same length. Compared with the only existing SQKD protocol with single photons in two degrees of freedom (Int J Theoret Phys 59:2807, 2020), this protocol has higher quantum communication efficiency.

TI BIGDML-Towards accurate quantum machine learning force fields for
   materials
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Most machine-learning force fields dismiss long-range interactions. Here the authors demonstrate the BIGDML approach for building materials' potential energy surfaces that enables a broad range of materials simulations within accuracies better than 1 meV/atom using just 10-200 structures for training.
   Machine-learning force fields (MLFF) should be accurate, computationally and data efficient, and applicable to molecules, materials, and interfaces thereof. Currently, MLFFs often introduce tradeoffs that restrict their practical applicability to small subsets of chemical space or require exhaustive datasets for training. Here, we introduce the Bravais-Inspired Gradient-Domain Machine Learning (BIGDML) approach and demonstrate its ability to construct reliable force fields using a training set with just 10-200 geometries for materials including pristine and defect-containing 2D and 3D semiconductors and metals, as well as chemisorbed and physisorbed atomic and molecular adsorbates on surfaces. The BIGDML model employs the full relevant symmetry group for a given material, does not assume artificial atom types or localization of atomic interactions and exhibits high data efficiency and state-of-the-art energy accuracies (errors substantially below 1 meV per atom) for an extended set of materials. Extensive path-integral molecular dynamics carried out with BIGDML models demonstrate the counterintuitive localization of benzene-graphene dynamics induced by nuclear quantum effects and their strong contributions to the hydrogen diffusion coefficient in a Pd crystal for a wide range of temperatures.

TI Graph Kernels Encoding Features of All Subgraphs by Quantum
   Superposition
SO IEEE JOURNAL ON EMERGING AND SELECTED TOPICS IN CIRCUITS AND SYSTEMS
AB Graph kernels are often used in bioinformatics and network applications to measure the similarity between graphs; therefore, they may be used to construct efficient graph classifiers. Many graph kernels have been developed thus far, but to the best of our knowledge there is no existing graph kernel that uses some features explicitly extracted from all subgraphs to measure similarity. We propose a novel graph kernel that applies a quantum computer to measure the similarity obtained from all subgraphs by fully exploiting the power of quantum superposition to encode every subgraph into a feature of particular form. For the construction of the quantum kernel, we develop an efficient protocol that clears the index information of the subgraphs encoded in the quantum state. We also prove that the quantum computer requires less query complexity to construct the feature vector than the classical sampler used to approximate the same vector. A detailed numerical simulation of a bioinformatics problem is presented to demonstrate that, in many cases, the proposed quantum kernel achieves better classification accuracy than existing graph kernels.

AB Satisfiability Modulo Theory (SMT) solvers are a useful tool that can be applied to a variety of problems, such as configuring relationships in distributed systems, detecting race conditions, and program analysis. String constraints are particularly difficult for SMT solvers to navigate, as the search space is generally large. Often times, classical SMT solvers will have to quit generating a solution for string constraints because it takes too long to find the solution. Quantum computing offers the advantages of quantum mechanics (e.g., superposition), which allows a system to explore a large search space much more efficiently. In this work, we explore creating a quantum-enabled SMT solver for string theory by using quantum annealing and Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO). Our preliminary results demonstrate that it is feasible to transform these string constraints to QUBO, and generate solutions for given constraints.

TI Efficient online quantum circuit learning with no upfront training
SO COMMUNICATIONS PHYSICS
AB Optimization is a promising candidate for studying the utility of variational quantum algorithms (VQAs). However, evaluating cost functions using quantum hardware introduces runtime overheads that limit exploration. Surrogate-based methods can reduce calls to a quantum computer, yet existing approaches require hyperparameter pre-training and have been tested only on small problems. Here, we show that surrogate-based methods can enable successful optimization at scale, without pre-training, by using radial basis function interpolation (RBF) to construct an adaptive, hyperparameter-free surrogate. Using the surrogate as an acquisition function drives hardware queries to the vicinity of the true optima. For 16-qubit random 3-regular Max-Cut instances with the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA), our method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches, without considering their upfront training costs. Furthermore, we successfully optimize QAOA circuits for 127-qubit random Ising models on an IBM processor using 104-105 measurements. Strong empirical performance demonstrates the promise of automated surrogate-based learning for large-scale VQA applications.

TI Correlation minor norms, entanglement detection and discord
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB In this paper we develop an approach for detecting entanglement, which is based on measuring quantum correlations and constructing a correlation matrix. The correlation matrix is then used for defining a family of parameters, named Correlation Minor Norms, which allow one to detect entanglement. This approach generalizes the computable cross-norm or realignment (CCNR) criterion, and moreover requires measuring a state-independent set of operators. Furthermore, we illustrate a scheme which yields for each Correlation Minor Norm a separable state that maximizes it. The proposed entanglement detection scheme is believed to be advantageous in comparison to other methods because correlations have a simple, intuitive meaning and in addition they can be directly measured in experiment. Moreover, it is demonstrated to be stronger than the CCNR criterion. We also illustrate the relation between the Correlation Minor Norm and entanglement entropy for pure states. Finally, we discuss the relation between the Correlation Minor Norm and quantum discord. We demonstrate that the CMN may be used to define a new measure for quantum discord.

TI Robust Quantum Sensing in Strongly Interacting Systems with Many-Body
   Scars
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB In most quantum sensing schemes, interactions between the constituent particles of the sensor are expected to lead to thermalization and degraded sensitivity. However, recent theoretical and experimental work has shown that the phenomenon of quantum many-body scarring can slow down, or even prevent, thermalization. We show that scarring can be exploited for quantum sensing that is robust against certain strong interactions. In the ideal case of perfect scars with harmonic energy gaps, the optimal sensing time can diverge despite the strong interactions. We demonstrate the idea with two examples: a spin-1 model with Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction and a spin-1/2 mixed-field Ising model. We also briefly discuss some nonideal perturbations and the addition of periodic controls to suppress their effect on sensing.

TI Cavity-mediated electron-photon pairs
SO SCIENCE
AB Quantum information, communication, and sensing rely on the generation and control of quantum correlations in complementary degrees of freedom. Free electrons coupled to photonics promise novel hybrid quantum technologies, although single-particle correlations and entanglement have yet to be shown. In this work, we demonstrate the preparation of electron-photon pair states using the phase-matched interaction of free electrons with the evanescent vacuum field of a photonic chip-based optical microresonator. Spontaneous inelastic scattering produces intracavity photons coincident with energy-shifted electrons, which we employ for noise-suppressed optical mode imaging. This parametric pair-state preparation will underpin the future development of free-electron quantum optics, providing a route to quantum-enhanced imaging, electron-photon entanglement, and heralded single-electron and Fock-state photon sources.

TI Exploring the impact of spontaneous emission in two quantum game-based
   key-distribution protocols
SO PHYSICA SCRIPTA
AB In this work, we investigate the influence that spontaneous emission has on the performance and security of both a qubit and a qutrit quantum key distribution protocols, if these were to be implemented using two- and three-level atoms, respectively. These protocols were developed based on the mechanics of a quantum version of the Monty-Hall game. In the case of three-level atoms, the three possible configurations (V, Xi, Lambda) are considered. In both protocols, an additional step, consisting on discarding some specific non-valid cases, is found to reduce the bit error ratio (BER). Regarding the security of the protocols, we are able to define secure regions, dependent on the spontaneous emission parameters, within which the protocols are deemed secure due to the violation of Bell-type inequalities. Furthermore, our results show that the choice of three-level atom configuration significantly impacts the protocol performance. We are able to determine that the Lambda configuration provides a lower BER than the V and Xi configurations within their respective secure regions.

TI Verification of phased Dicke states
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Dicke states are typical examples of quantum states with genuine multipartite entanglement. They are valuable resources in many quantum information processing tasks, including multiparty quantum communication and quantum metrology. Phased Dicke states are a generalization of Dicke states and include antisymmetric basis states as a special example. These states are useful in atomic and molecular physics besides quantum information processing. Here we propose practical and efficient protocols based on adaptive local projective measurements for verifying all phased Dicke states, including W states and qudit Dicke states. To verify any n-partite phased Dicke state within infidelity epsilon and significance level delta, the number of tests required is only O(n epsilon(-1) ln delta(-1)), which is linear in n and is exponentially more efficient than traditional tomographic approaches. In the case of W states, the number of tests can be further reduced to O(root n epsilon(-1) ln delta(-1)). Moreover, we construct an optimal protocol for any antisymmetric basis state; the number of tests required decreases (rather than increases) monotonically with n. This is the only optimal protocol known for multipartite nonstabilizer states.

TI Verifiable measurement-based quantum random sampling with trapped ions
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Quantum computers are now on the brink of outperforming their classical counterparts. One way to demonstrate the advantage of quantum computation is through quantum random sampling performed on quantum computing devices. However, existing tools for verifying that a quantum device indeed performed the classically intractable sampling task are either impractical or not scalable to the quantum advantage regime. The verification problem thus remains an outstanding challenge. Here, we experimentally demonstrate efficiently verifiable quantum random sampling in the measurement-based model of quantum computation on a trapped-ion quantum processor. We create and sample from random cluster states, which are at the heart of measurement-based computing, up to a size of 4 x 4 qubits. By exploiting the structure of these states, we are able to recycle qubits during the computation to sample from entangled cluster states that are larger than the qubit register. We then efficiently estimate the fidelity to verify the prepared states-in single instances and on average-and compare our results to cross-entropy benchmarking. Finally, we study the effect of experimental noise on the certificates. Our results and techniques provide a feasible path toward a verified demonstration of a quantum advantage.

TI Pulsar classification: comparing quantum convolutional neural networks
   and quantum support vector machines
SO QUANTUM MACHINE INTELLIGENCE
AB Well-known quantum machine learning techniques, specifically quantum kernel-assisted support vector machines (QSVMs) and quantum convolutional neural networks (QCNNs), are applied to the binary classification of pulsars. In this comparative study, it is illustrated with simulations that both quantum methods successfully achieve effective classification of the HTRU-2 data set that connects pulsar class labels to eight separate features. While QCNNs are superior in terms of training and prediction speed compared to QSVMs, the preference shifts toward QSVMs when the present noisy NISQ-era devices are incorporated into the comparison. QSVMs demonstrate superior overall performance compared to QCNNs when assessed using binary classification performance metrics. Classical methods are implemented to serve as a benchmark for comparison with the quantum approaches.

TI Variational Quantum-Based Simulation of Waveguide Modes
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON MICROWAVE THEORY AND TECHNIQUES
AB Variational quantum algorithms (VQAs) are one of the most promising methods that can be implemented on noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) machines to achieve a quantum advantage over classical computers. This article describes the use of a VQA in conjunction with the finite difference method for the calculation of propagation modes of an electromagnetic wave in a hollow metallic waveguide. The two-dimensional (2-D) waveguide problem, described by the Helmholtz equation, is approximated by a system of linear equations, whose solutions are expressed in terms of simple quantum expectation values that can be evaluated efficiently on quantum hardware. Numerical examples are presented to validate the proposed method for solving 2-D waveguide problems.

TI Unselective ground-state blockade of Rydberg atoms for implementing
   quantum gates
SO FRONTIERS OF PHYSICS
AB A dynamics regime of Rydberg atoms, unselective ground-state blockade (UGSB), is proposed in the context of Rydberg antiblockade (RAB), where the evolution of two atoms is suppressed when they populate in an identical ground state. UGSB is used to implement a SWAP gate in one step without individual addressing of atoms. Aiming at circumventing common issues in RAB-based gates including atomic decay, Doppler dephasing, and fluctuations in the interatomic coupling strength, we modify the RAB condition to achieve a dynamical SWAP gate whose robustness is much greater than that of the nonadiabatic holonomic one in the conventional RAB regime. In addition, on the basis of the proposed SWAP gates, we further investigate the implementation of a three-atom Fredkin gate by combining Rydberg blockade and RAB. The present work may facilitate to implement the RAB-based gates of strongly coupled atoms in experiment.

TI FIB-fabrication of superconducting devices based on

SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB Recent advances in quantum technologies are highly influencing the current technological scenario. Hybrid devices combining superconductors and topological insulators represent an excellent opportunity to study the topological superconducting phase, which offers interesting features that might have significant implications in the development of quantum sensing and quantum computing. Furthermore, focused ion beam techniques, whose versatility enables to create sophisticated devices with high degree of customization, can enhance the creation of complex devices. Here, we develop a novel approach for creating single-crystal devices that is applied to the fabrication of superconducting devices based on topological insulator Bi2Se3 in a geometry characteristic of a superconducting quantum interference device. Characterization of these devices reveals that superconductivity is induced in our crystal and the supercurrent is modulated by applying an external magnetic field. These results open the way to tailoring the response of hybrid devices that combine superconductors and topological insulators by focused ion beam techniques.

TI Problem-structure-informed quantum approximate optimization for
   large-scale unit commitment with limited qubits
SO IENERGY
AB As power systems expand, solving the unit commitment problem (UCP) becomes increasingly challenging due to the curse of dimensionality, and traditional methods often struggle to balance computational efficiency and solution optimality. To tackle this issue, we propose a problem-structure-informed quantum approximate optimization algorithm (QAOA) framework that fully exploits the quantum advantage under extremely limited quantum resources. Specifically, we leverage the inherent topological structure of power systems to decompose large-scale UCP instances into smaller subproblems, which are solvable in parallel by limited number of qubits. This decomposition not only circumvents the current hardware limitations of quantum computing but also achieves higher performance as the graph structure of the power system becomes more sparse. Consequently, our approach can be extended to future power systems that are larger and more complex.

Here, we integrate tin-vacancy centers in a diamond waveguide and investigate the interaction with light at the single-photon level in both reflection and transmission. We observe singleemitter-induced extinction of the transmitted light up to 25% and measure the nonlinear effect on the photon statistics. Furthermore, we demonstrate fully tunable interference between the reflected singlephoton field and laser light backscattered at the fiber end and show the corresponding controlled change between bunched and antibunched photon statistics in the reflected field.

TI Probing many-body localization on a noisy quantum computer
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB A disordered quantum system of interacting particles exhibits localized behavior when the disorder is large compared to the interaction strength. Studying this phenomenon on a quantum computer with no, or limited, error correction is challenging because even weak coupling to a thermal environment destroys most signatures of localization. Fortunately, spectral functions of local operators are known to contain features that can survive the presence of noise. In these spectra, discrete peaks and a soft gap at low frequencies compared to the thermal phase indicate localization. Here, we present the computation of spectral functions on a trapped-ion quantum computer for a one-dimensional Heisenberg model with disorder. Further, we design an error-mitigation technique which is effective at removing the noise from the measurement allowing clear signatures of localization to emerge as the disorder increases. Thus, we show that spectral functions can serve as a robust and scalable diagnostic of many-body localization on current and future generations of quantum computers.

TI Donor-Acceptor Pair Quantum Emitters in Hexagonal Boron Nitride
SO NANO LETTERS
AB Quantum emitters are needed for a myriad of applications ranging from quantum sensing to quantum computing. Hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) quantum emitters are one of the most promising solid-state platforms to date due to their high brightness and stability and the possibility of a spin-photon interface. However, the understanding of the physical origins of the single-photon emitters (SPEs) is still limited. Here we report dense SPEs in hBN across the entire visible spectrum and present evidence that most of these SPEs can be well explained by donor-acceptor pairs (DAPS). On the basis of the DAP transition generation mechanism, we calculated their wavelength fingerprint, matching well with the experimentally observed photoluminescence spectrum. Our work serves as a step forward for the physical understanding of SPEs in hBN and their applications in quantum technologies.

TI Improving qubit coherence using closed-loop feedback
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB The presence of various noises in the qubit environment is a major limitation on qubit coherence time. Here, the authors demonstrate the use a closed-loop feedback to stabilize frequency noise in a flux-tunable superconducting qubit and suggest this as a scalable approach applicable to other types of noise.
   Superconducting qubits are a promising platform for building a larger-scale quantum processor capable of solving otherwise intractable problems. In order for the processor to reach practical viability, the gate errors need to be further suppressed and remain stable for extended periods of time. With recent advances in qubit control, both single- and two-qubit gate fidelities are now in many cases limited by the coherence times of the qubits. Here we experimentally employ closed-loop feedback to stabilize the frequency fluctuations of a superconducting transmon qubit, thereby increasing its coherence time by 26% and reducing the single-qubit error rate from (8.5 +/- 2.1) x 10(-4) to (5.9 +/- 0.7) x 10(-4). Importantly, the resulting high-fidelity operation remains effective even away from the qubit flux-noise insensitive point, significantly increasing the frequency bandwidth over which the qubit can be operated with high fidelity. This approach is helpful in large qubit grids, where frequency crowding and parasitic interactions between the qubits limit their performance.

We consider the maximization problem of determining the most expensive path in a control flow graph. In these graphs, vertices represent blocks of code whose execution times are fixed and known in advance. We port the considered optimization problem to the quantum framework by expressing it as a QUBO. We then experimentally compare the performances in solving the problem of classic Simulated Annealing (SA), Quantum Annealing (QA), and Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA). Our experiments suggest that QA represents a fast equivalent of simulated annealing. Indeed, we measured the approximation ratio on the results of QA and SA, showing that their performances are comparable, at least on our set of simplified problems.

TI Exploring Quantum Annealing Architectures: A Spin Glass Perspective
SO ADVANCED QUANTUM TECHNOLOGIES
AB This work analyzes the spin-glass transition across various Ising models relevant to quantum annealers. By employing the parallel tempering method, the location of the spin-glass phase transition is extrapolated from the pseudo-critical temperature of finite-sized systems. The results confirm a spin-glass phase at finite temperature in random-regular and small-world graphs, in agreement with previous studies. However, strong evidence is obtained that this phase only occurs at zero temperature in the quasi-2D graphs of D-Wave, as their pseudo-critical temperature drifts toward zero. This implies that the asymptotic runtime to find the low-energy configuration of those graphs is likely to be polynomial in the size of the problem. Nevertheless, this scaling may only be reached for system sizes much larger than existing annealers, as the drift in the pseudo-critical temperature is slow. This slowness, together with an abrupt increase in thermalization times around the pseudo-critical temperature, may render the search for low-energy configurations with classical methods impractical.
   The search for quantum advantage with quantum annealers requires finding families of problems in which classical methods fail, leaving room for improvement. In search of these families and their characteristics, Ising problems with the topologies of D-Wave's annealers are studied and a dichotomy is reconciled: in theory, they should be easy, but in practice, they are hard. image

TI Emerging generalization advantage of quantum-inspired machine learning
   in the diagnosis of hepatocellular carcinoma
SO DISCOVER APPLIED SCIENCES
AB Research into quantum advantage is increasingly taking on an interdisciplinary character. In particular, quantum machine learning shows promising generalization capabilities, which we have exploited in the classification of hepatocellular carcinoma tissue based on microarray gene expressions. By using previously characterized genetic communities, we minimize the computational complexity associated with the number of qubits, enabling the execution of quantum-inspired algorithms on classical machines. We consider two categories of such algorithms: parameterized quantum circuits (PQC) and tensor networks. The variational optimization of PQCs achieves better accuracy than classical counterparts on the independent test set, reaching an advantage equal to 11%\documentclass[12pt]{minimal} \usepackage{amsmath} \usepackage{wasysym} \usepackage{amsfonts} \usepackage{amssymb} \usepackage{amsbsy} \usepackage{mathrsfs} \usepackage{upgreek} \setlength{\oddsidemargin}{-69pt} \begin{document}$$11\%$$\end{document} in accuracy, while tensor networks offer equivalent performance with fewer parameters.

TI Maximal Entropy Approach for Quantum State Tomography
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB Quantum computation has been growing rapidly in both theory and experiments. In particular, quantum computing devices with a large number of qubits have been developed by IBM, Google, IonQ, and others. The current quantum computing devices are noisy intermediate-scale quantum devices, and so approaches to validate quantum processing on these quantum devices are needed. One of the most common ways of validation for an n-qubit quantum system is quantum tomography, which tries to reconstruct a quantum system's density matrix by a complete set of observables. However, the inherent noise in the quantum systems and the intrinsic limitations pose a critical challenge to precisely know the actual measurement operators that make quantum tomography impractical in experiments. Here, we propose an alternative approach to quantum tomography, based on the maximal information entropy, that can predict the values of unknown observables based on the available mean measurement data. This can then be used to reconstruct the density matrix with high fidelity even though the results for some observables are missing. Of additional contexts, a practical approach to the inference of the quantum mechanical state using only partial information is also needed.

TI Realigned Hardy's paradox
SO RESULTS IN PHYSICS
AB Hardy's paradox provides an "All-versus-Nothing" fashion to directly certify that quantum mechanics cannot be completely described by local realistic theory. However, when considering potential imperfections in experiments, like noisy entanglement source and low detection efficiency, the original Hardy's paradox can only induce a rather small Hardy violation, and is difficult to reveal. To overcome this challenge, we have proposed a realigned Hardy's paradox, which can dramatically improve the Hardy violation. Furthermore, we have generalized the realigned Hardy's paradox to arbitrary even n dichotomic measurements. For n = 2, 4 and 6 cases, the realigned Hardy's paradox can achieve Hardy values approximate 0.4140, 0.7734 and 0.8875 respectively for qubit systems, compared with only 0.09 of the original Hardy's paradox. Meanwhile, the structure of the realigned Hardy's paradox is simpler and more robust, in the sense that there is only one Hardy condition. We anticipate that the realigned Hardy's paradox can tolerate more experimental imperfections and help to stimulate more fascinating quantum information applications.

TI The masking condition for the quantum state in two-dimensional Hilbert
   space
SO COMMUNICATIONS IN THEORETICAL PHYSICS
AB This paper focuses on quantum information masking for the quantum state in two-dimensional Hilbert space. We present a system of equations as the condition of quantum information masking. It is shown that quantum information contained in a single qubit state can be masked, if and only if the coefficients of the quantum state satisfy the given system of equations. By observing the characteristics of non-orthogonal maskable quantum states, we obtain a related conclusion, namely, if two non-orthogonal two-qubit quantum states can mask a single qubit state, they have the same number of terms and the same basis. Finally, for maskable orthogonal quantum states, we analyze two special examples and give their images for an intuitive description.

TI An Applied Analysis of Securing 5G/6G Core Networks with Post-Quantum
   Key Encapsulation Methods
SO ELECTRONICS
AB Fifth Generation (5G) cellular networks have been adopted worldwide since the rollout began around 2019. It brought with it many innovations and new services, such as Enhanced Mobile Broadband (eMBB), Ultra Reliable and Low-Latency Communications (URLLC), and Massive Internet of Things (mIoT). Furthermore, 5G introduced a more scalable approach to network operations using fully software-based Virtualized Network Functions (VNF) in Core Networks (CN) rather than the prior hardware-based approach. However, while this shift towards a fully software-based system design provides numerous significant benefits, such as increased interoperability, scalability, and cost-effectiveness, it also brings with it an increased cybersecurity risk. Security is crucial to maintaining trust between vendors, operators, and consumers. Cyberattacks are rapidly increasing in number and sophistication, and we are seeing a shift towards zero-trust approaches. This means that even communications between VNFs inside a 5G core must be scrutinized and hardened against attacks, especially with the advent of quantum computers. The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), over the past 10 years, has led efforts to standardize post-quantum cryptography (PQC) to protect against quantum attacks. This paper covers a custom implementation of the open-source free5GC CN, to expand its HTTPS capabilities for VNFs by introducing PQC Key Encapsulation Methods (KEM) for Transport Layer Security (TLS) v1.3. This paper provides the details of this integration with a focus on the latency of different PQC KEMs in initial handshakes between VNFs, on packet size, and the implications in a 5G environment. This work also conducts a security comparison between the PQC-equipped free5GC and other open-source 5G CNs. The presented results indicate a negligible increase in UE connection setup duration and a small increase in connection setup data requirements, strongly indicating that PQC KEM's benefits far outweigh any downsides when integrated into 5G and 6G core services. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work incorporating PQC into an open-source 5G core. Furthermore, the results from this effort demonstrate that employing PQC ciphers for securing VNF communications results in only a negligible impact on latency and bandwidth usage, thus demonstrating significant benefits to 5G cybersecurity.

TI A High-Reliability Quantum Communication Protocol via
   Controllable-Signal Attenuation
SO PHOTONICS
AB Since the protocol for counterfactual quantum communication was proposed, complete counterfactuality can be achieved as there are no physical particles in the transmission channel. However, it relies on some restrictive factors, such as requiring an infinite number of beam splitters and no degradation. We conducted numerical simulations to assess the reliability of quantum communication combined with the actual test environment and found that the inevitable degradation, including component losses or path losses, limits the number of beam splitters. Furthermore, we carried out the experimental simulation of a high-reliability direct communication protocol using the method of controllable-signal attenuation. The peak reliability of mu 1=27.6 +/- 0.22 that was obtained was much higher than the current communication protocol of the chained interferometer system. The optimized experimental equipment could compensate the system's balance under various restrictive conditions and make it possible to achieve 100% reliability with imperfect interferometers.

TI On the Homomorphic Properties of Kyber and McEliece with Application to
   Post-Quantum Private Set Intersection
SO CRYPTOGRAPHY
AB Crystals-Kyber and Classic-McEliece are two prominent post-quantum key encapsulation mechanisms (KEMs) designed to address the challenges posed by quantum computing to classical cryptographic schemes. While the former has been standardized by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), the latter is well-known for its exceptional robustness and as one of the finalists of the fourth round of post-quantum cryptography standardization. Private set intersection (PSI) is a privacy-preserving technique that enables two parties, each possessing a dataset, to compute the intersection of their sets without revealing anything else. This can be achieved thanks to homomorphic encryption (HE), which allows computations on encrypted data. In this paper, firstly, we study Kyber and McEliece, apart from being KEMs, as post-quantum public key encryption (PKE), and examine their homomorphic properties. Secondly, we design two different two-party PSI protocols that utilize the homomorphic capabilities of Kyber and McEliece. Thirdly, a practical performance evaluation under NIST's security levels 1, 3, and 5 is conducted, focusing on three key metrics: storage overhead, communication overhead, and computation cost. Insights indicate that the Kyber-based PSI Protocol, which utilizes the multiplicative homomorphic property, is secure but less efficient. In contrast, the McEliece-based PSI protocol, while efficient in practice, raises concerns regarding its security as a homomorphic encryption scheme.

TI Dark-state-induced heat rectification
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW E
AB Heat and noise control is essential for the continued development of quantum technologies. For this purpose, a particularly powerful tool is the heat rectifier, which allows for heat transport in one configuration of two baths but not the reverse. Here we propose a class of rectifiers that exploits the unidirectionality of a low temperature bath to force the system into a dark state, thus blocking heat transport in one configuration of the two baths. However, if the two baths are switched around, a heat current is observed. An implementation using a qutrit coupled to two harmonic oscillators is proposed and rectification values beyond 103 are achieved for realistic parameter values. Furthermore, we show that the heat current can be amplified by an order of magnitude through external driving without diminishing the diode functionality. The heat rectification effect is seen for a large range of parameters and it is robust towards both decay and dephasing.

TI Variational quantum and neural quantum states algorithms for the linear
   complementarity problem
SO PHILOSOPHICAL TRANSACTIONS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY A-MATHEMATICAL PHYSICAL
   AND ENGINEERING SCIENCES
AB Variational quantum algorithms (VQAs) are promising hybrid quantum-classical methods designed to leverage the computational advantages of quantum computing while mitigating the limitations of current noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) hardware. Although VQAs have been demonstrated as proofs of concept, their practical utility in solving real-world problems-and whether quantum-inspired classical algorithms can match their performance-remains an open question. We present a novel application of the variational quantum linear solver (VQLS) and its classical neural quantum states-based counterpart, the variational neural linear solver (VNLS), as key components within a minimum map Newton solver for a complementarity-based rigid-body contact model. We demonstrate using the VNLS that our solver accurately simulates the dynamics of rigid spherical bodies during collision events. These results suggest that quantum and quantum-inspired linear algebra algorithms can serve as viable alternatives to standard linear algebra solvers for modelling certain physical systems.This article is part of the theme issue 'Numerical analysis, spectral graph theory, orthogonal polynomials and quantum algorithms'.

TI Environment-assisted bosonic quantum communications
SO NPJ QUANTUM INFORMATION
AB We consider a quantum relay that is used by two parties to perform several continuous-variable protocols of quantum communication, from entanglement distribution (swapping and distillation) to quantum teleportation, and quantum key distribution. The theory of these protocols is suitably extended to a non-Markovian model of decoherence characterized by correlated Gaussian noise in the bosonic environment. In the worst-case scenario where bipartite entanglement is completely lost at the relay, we show that the various protocols can be reactivated by the assistance of classical (separable) correlations in the environment. In fact, above a critical amount, these correlations are able to guarantee the distribution of a weaker form of entanglement (quadripartite), which can be localized by the relay into a stronger form (bipartite) that is exploitable by the parties. Our findings are confirmed by a proof-of-principle experiment where we show, for the first time, that memory effects in the environment can drastically enhance the performance of a quantum relay, well beyond the single-repeater bound for quantum and private communications.

TI Quantum Information Patterns Between Atoms in a Molecule
SO CHEMISTRY-A EUROPEAN JOURNAL
AB Quantum information theory provides a powerful toolbox of descriptors that characterize many-electron systems based on quantum information patterns between open quantum systems. Despite the wealth of insights gained in the condensed matter community, the use of these descriptors to study interactions between atoms in a molecule remains limited. In this study, we develop a quantum information framework for molecules that characterizes the quantum information patterns between quantum atoms as defined in the Quantum Theory of Atoms in Molecules. We show that quantum information analyses capture key properties of quantum atoms and how they interact with their molecular environment. Additionally, we show that the presence of bond critical points can remain invariant despite large changes in the quantum information patterns between the quantum atoms. Our findings indicate that quantum information theory can shed a new light on molecular electronic structure.
   Atoms in a molecule are conceptual open quantum systems that exchange information. Quantifying that information allows for the characterization of such quantum atoms and how they interact with their molecular environment. image

TI Robust quantum gates using smooth pulses and physics-informed neural
   networks
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB The presence of decoherence in quantum computers necessitates the suppression of noise. Dynamically corrected gates via specially designed control pulses offer a path forward, but hardware-specific experimental constraints can cause complications. Existing methods to obtain smooth pulses are either restricted to two-level systems, require an optimization over noise realizations, or limited to piecewise-continuous pulse sequences. In this paper, we present the first general method for obtaining truly smooth pulses that minimizes sensitivity to noise, eliminating the need for sampling over noise realizations and making assumptions regarding the underlying statistics of the experimental noise. We parametrize the Hamiltonian using a neural network, which allows the use of a large number of optimization parameters to adequately explore the functional control space. We demonstrate the capability of our approach by finding smooth shapes, which suppress the effects of noise within the logical subspace as well as leakage out of that subspace.

TI Post-quantum distributed ledger technology: a systematic survey
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB Blockchain technology finds widespread application across various fields due to its key features such as immutability, reduced costs, decentralization, and transparency. The security of blockchain relies on elements like hashing, digital signatures, and cryptography. However, the emergence of quantum computers and supporting algorithms poses a threat to blockchain security. These quantum algorithms pose a significant threat to both public-key cryptography and hash functions, compelling the redesign of blockchain architectures. This paper investigates the status quo of the post-quantum, quantum-safe, or quantum-resistant cryptosystems within the framework of blockchain. This study starts with a fundamental overview of both blockchain and quantum computing, examining their reciprocal influence and evolution. Subsequently, a comprehensive literature review is conducted focusing on Post-Quantum Distributed Ledger Technology (PQDLT). This research emphasizes the practical implementation of these protocols and algorithms providing extensive comparisons of characteristics and performance. This work will help to foster further research at the intersection of post-quantum cryptography and blockchain systems and give prospective directions for future PQDLT researchers and developers.

TI Quantum entanglement in a mixed-spin trimer: Effects of a magnetic field
   and heterogeneous g factors
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW E
AB Mixed spin-(1/2,1/2,1) trimer with two different Land & eacute; g factors and two different exchange couplings is considered. The main feature of the model is nonconserving magnetization. The Hamiltonian of the system is diagonalized analytically. We presented a detailed analysis of the ground-state properties, revealing several possible ground-state phase diagrams and magnetization profiles. The main focus is on how nonconserving magnetization affects quantum entanglement. We have found that nonconserving magnetization can bring a continuous dependence of the entanglement quantifying parameter (negativity) on the magnetic field within the same eigenstate, while for the case of uniform g factors it is a constant. The main result is an essential enhancement of the entanglement in the case of uniform couplings for one pair of spins caused by an arbitrary small difference in the values of g factors. This enhancement is robust and brings almost a sevenfold increase of the negativity. We have also found a weakening of entanglement for other cases. Thus, nonconserving magnetization offers a broad opportunity to manipulate the entanglement by means of a magnetic field.

TI Cavity-enhanced light-matter interaction in Vogel-spiral devices as a
   platform for quantum photonics
SO APPLIED PHYSICS LETTERS
AB Enhancing light-matter interactions on a chip is of paramount importance for classical and quantum photonics, sensing, and energy harvesting applications. Several photonic geometries have been developed, allowing high extraction efficiencies, enhanced light-matter interactions, and control over the spontaneous emission dynamics of solid-state quantum light sources. To this end, a device geometry resilient to nanofabrication imperfections, providing high-quality light confinement and control over the emitted light properties, would be desirable. We demonstrate that aperiodic arrangements, whose geometry is inspired by natural systems where scattering elements are arranged following Fibonacci series, represent a platform for enhancing the light-matter interaction in on-chip nanophotonic devices, allowing us to achieve efficient visible light confinement. We use optically active defect centers in silicon nitride as internal light sources to image and characterize, by means of microphotoluminescence spectroscopy, the individual optical modes confined by photonic membranes with Vogel-spiral geometry. By studying the statistics of the measured optical resonances, in combination with rigorous multiple scattering theory, we observe lognormal distributions and report quality factors with values as high as 2201 +/- 443. Our findings improve the understanding of the fundamental physical properties of light-emitting Vogel-spiral systems and show their application to active nanophotonic devices. These results set the basis for further development of quantum devices that leverage the unique properties of aperiodic Vogel spiral order on a chip, including angular momentum states, thus producing mode structures for information processing and communications.

TI Quantitative security analysis of three-level unitary operations in
   quantum secret sharing without entanglement
SO FRONTIERS IN PHYSICS
AB Quantum secret sharing (QSS) protocols without entanglement have showed high security by virtue of the characteristics of quantum mechanics. However, it is still a challenge to compare the security of such protocols depending on quantitative security analysis. Based on our previous security analysis work on protocols using single qubits and two-level unitary operations, QSS protocols with single qutrits and three-level unitary operations are considered in this paper. Under the Bell-state attack we propose, the quantitative security analyses according to different three-level unitary operations are provided respectively in the one-step and two-step situations. Finally, important conclusions are drawn for designing and implementing such QSS protocols. The method and results may also contribute to analyze the security of other high-level quantum cryptography schemes based on unitary operations.

TI Optimal qubit-mediated quantum heat transfer via noncommuting operators
   and strong coupling effects
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
AB Heat transfer in quantum systems is a current topic of interest due to emerging quantum technologies that attempt to miniaturize engines and examine fundamental aspects of thermodynamics. In this work we consider heat transfer between two thermal reservoirs in which a central spin degree of freedom mediates the process. Our objective is to identify the system-bath coupling operators that maximize heat transfer at arbitrary system-bath coupling strengths. By employing a Markovian embedding method in the form of the reaction-coordinate mapping, we study numerically heat transfer at arbitrary system-bath coupling energy and for general system-bath coupling operators between the baths and the central qubit system. We find a stark contrast in the conditions required for optimal heat transfer depending on whether the system is weakly or strongly coupled to the heat baths. In the weak-coupling regime, optimal heat transfer requires identical coupling operators that facilitate maximum sequential transport, resonant with the central qubit. In contrast, in the strong-coupling regime, noncommuting system-bath coupling operators between the hot and cold reservoirs are necessary to achieve optimal heat transfer. We further employ the Effective Hamiltonian theory and gain partial analytical insights into the observed phenomena. We discuss the limitations of this approximate method in capturing the behavior of the heat current for noncommuting coupling operators, calling for its future extensions to capture transport properties in systems with general interaction Hamiltonians.

TI Faithfulness and Sensitivity for Ancilla-Assisted Process Tomography
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB A system-ancilla bipartite state capable of containing the complete information of an unknown quantum channel acting on the system is called faithful. In this work, we extend the applicability and generality of faithfulness significantly by introducing its local variant and examining their relationship when applied to various classes of quantum channels. In doing so, we discovered that, in the original proof by D'Ariano and Presti, only sufficiency was shown, not the full equivalence between faithfulness of state and invertibility of the corresponding Jamiolkowski map. We complete the proof by showing necessity and examine how far this characterization of faithfulness can be generalized by applying it to various classes of quantum channels. We also explore a more general notion we call sensitivity, the property of quantum state being altered by any nontrivial action of quantum channel. We study their relationship by characterizing both properties for important classes of quantum channels such as unital channels, random unitary operations, and unitary operations. Unexpected (non)equivalence results among them shed light on the structure of quantum channels by showing that we need only two classes of quantum states for characterizing quantum states faithful or sensitive to various subclasses of quantum channels.

TI Dissipation-induced Liouville-Majorana modes in open quantum system
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB In open quantum systems, topological edge states rapidly lose coherence, making them unsuitable for topological quantum computation and quantum memory. In this study, we demonstrate that topologically nonHermitian Liouville-Majorana edge modes (LMEMs) can persist in the extended Liouville-Fock space (LFS) of dissipative quantum spin or fermionic systems. This finding extends the scope of topological modes beyond typical Hermitian systems. By vectorizing the Lindblad equation of a dissipative Ising-type spin system using third quantization, we prove that it can be reduced to a series of non-Hermitian Kitaev chains in the extended LFS and that topologically protected LMEMs emerge due to internal symmetry. Furthermore, we present an explicit method for detecting these modes and demonstrate that the purity of the density matrix characterizes the long-range correlation of LMEMs. Our work offers a new direction for identifying stable topological states in open quantum systems induced by quantum jumps.

TI Harvesting magic from the vacuum
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Magic is the quantum resource allowing a quantum computer to perform operations that cannot be simulated efficiently by classical computation. As such, generating magic in a quantum system is crucial for achieving quantum advantage. This article shows that magic can be harvested by a three-level Unruh-DeWitt detector (a qutrit) interacting with a quantum field in an initial vacuum state. While the idea of extracting resources from Quantum Field Theories (QFT) was born from the harvesting of entanglement, our result extends the protocol to evolve a qutrit from a nonmagical state to a magical one, making it possible to generate magic from QFT.

TI Privacy protection of quantum BP neural network based on game theory
SO PHYSICA SCRIPTA
AB How to ensure privacy security and improve computing efficiency is a research hotspot in the field of machine learning. Among them, how to balance the interests of users, cloud servers and attackers on the premise of ensuring user privacy is a difficult problem in the field of machine learning privacy protection. The development of quantum computing breaks through the computational bottleneck of classical machine learning and has derived the research direction of quantum machine learning. At present, hybrid quantum-classical machine learning in NISQ era has become a research hotspot, but researchers rarely pay attention to the privacy protection in quantum machine learning. Therefore, this paper is the first to apply game theory to the privacy protection in quantum machine learning and proposes the privacy game model of user - server - attacker in Hybrid Classical Quantum BP Neural Network (HCQBPNN). Different from previous studies, this paper sets game strategies based on users' privacy requirements in practical applications, and aims to maximize the interests of attackers, cloud servers and users. The experiment proves that users can use the privacy game model proposed in this paper to get the optimal privacy combination strategy, and at the same time make the cloud server and the attacker can obtain positive income.

TI Optimal cooling configurations for quantum information processing at
   milli-kelvin temperatures
SO CRYOGENICS
AB So called quantum supremacy has been demonstrated by at least two groups utilising < 100 physical superconducting qubits cooled to milli-kelvin temperatures. It is acknowledged that scaling these efforts to faulttolerant, general purpose quantum computers will require very many more logical qubits, each formed from several physical ones.
   Addressing and control of these qubits is an area of active research, but it is likely that increased cooling capacities, particularly at the lowest temperatures, will be a requirement for the realisation of systems beyond noisy intermediate-scale quantum processors.
   Here we demonstrate a method by which significantly increased cooling power at temperatures similar to 200 mK can be generated without impacting on the performance of an adjacent stage providing cooling power at temperatures similar to 20 mK.

AB Quantum Layout Synthesis (QLS) plays a crucial role in optimizing quantum circuit execution on physical quantum devices. As we enter the era where quantum computers have hundreds of qubits, optimal OLS tools face scalability issues, while heuristic methods suffer significant optimality gap due to the lack of global optimization. To address these challenges, we introduce a multilevel framework, which is an effective methodology for solving large-scale problems in VLSI design. In this paper, we present ML-QLS, the first multilevel quantum layout tool with a scalable refinement operation integrated with novel cost functions and clustering strategies. Our clustering provides valuable insights into generating a proper problem approximation for quantum circuits and devices. The experimental results demonstrate that ML-QLS can scale up to problems involving hundreds of qubits and achieve a remarkable 69% performance improvement over leading heuristic QLS tools for large circuits, which underscores the effectiveness of multilevel frameworks in quantum applications.

TI Entanglement and quantum coherence of two YIG spheres in a hybrid
   Laguerre-Gaussian cavity optomechanics
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB We theoretically investigate continuous variable entanglement and macroscopic quantum coherence in the hybrid L-G rotational cavity optomechanical system containing two YIG spheres. In this system, a single L-G cavity mode and both magnon modes (which are due to the collective excitation of spins in two YIG spheres) are coupled through the magnetic dipole interaction whereas the L-G cavity mode can also exchange orbital angular momentum (OAM) with the rotating mirror (RM). We study in detail the effects of various physical parameters like cavity and both magnon detunings, environment temperature, optorotational and magnon coupling strengths on the bipartite entanglement and the macroscopic quantum coherence as well. We also explore parameter regimes to achieve maximum values for both of these quantum correlations. We also observed that the parameters regime for achieving maximum bipartite entanglement is completely different from macroscopic quantum coherence. So, our present study shall provide a method to control various nonclassical quantum correlations of macroscopic objects in the hybrid L-G rotational cavity optomechanical system and have potential applications in quantum sensing, quantum meteorology, and quantum information science.

TI Boundaries of quantum supremacy via random circuit sampling
SO NPJ QUANTUM INFORMATION
AB Google's quantum supremacy experiment heralded a transition point where quantum computers can evaluate a computational task, random circuit sampling, faster than classical supercomputers. We examine the constraints on the region of quantum advantage for quantum circuits with a larger number of qubits and gates than experimentally implemented. At near-term gate fidelities, we demonstrate that quantum supremacy is limited to circuits with a qubit count and circuit depth of a few hundred. Larger circuits encounter two distinct boundaries: a return of a classical advantage and practically infeasible quantum runtimes. Decreasing error rates cause the region of a quantum advantage to grow rapidly. At error rates required for early implementations of the surface code, the largest circuit size within the quantum supremacy regime coincides approximately with the smallest circuit size needed to implement error correction. Thus, the boundaries of quantum supremacy may fortuitously coincide with the advent of scalable, error-corrected quantum computing.

TI Tight finite-key analysis for generalized high-dimensional quantum key
   distribution
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Due to the capability of tolerating high error rate and generating more key bits per trial, high-dimensional quantum key distribution attracts wide interest. Despite great progresses in high-dimensional quantum key distribution, there are still some gaps between theory and experiment. One of these is that the security of the secret key heavily depends on the number of the emitted signals. So far, the existing security proofs are only suitable in the case with an infinite or unpractically large number of emitted signals. Here, by introducing the idea of "key classification" and developing relevant techniques based on the uncertainty relation for smooth entropies, we propose a tight finite-key analysis suitable for generalized high-dimensional quantum key distribution protocols. Benefitting from our theory, high-dimensional quantum key distribution protocols with finite resources become experimentally feasible.

TI 4-Clique network minor embedding for quantum annealers
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW APPLIED
AB Quantum annealing is a quantum algorithm for computing solutions to combinatorial optimization problems. This study proposes a method for minor embedding optimization problems onto sparse quantum annealing hardware graphs called 4 -clique network minor embedding. This method is in contrast to the standard minor embedding technique of using a path of linearly connected qubits in order to represent a logical variable state. The 4 -clique minor embedding is possible on Pegasus graph connectivity, which is the native hardware graph for some of the current D -Wave quantum annealers. The Pegasus hardware graph contains many cliques of size 4, making it possible to form a graph composed entirely of paths of connected 4 -cliques on which a problem can be minor -embedded. The 4 -clique chains come at the cost of additional qubit usage on the hardware graph, but they allow for stronger coupling within each chain, thereby increasing chain integrity, reducing chain breaks, and allow for greater usage of the available energy scale for programming logical problem coefficients on current quantum annealers. The 4 -clique minor embedding technique is compared with the standard linear path minor embedding with experiments on two D -Wave quantum annealing processors with Pegasus hardware graphs. We show proof -of -concept experiments where the 4 -clique minor embeddings can use weak chain strengths while successfully carrying out the computation of minimizing random all -to -all spin glass problem instances.

TI Measurement of Bell-type inequalities and quantum entanglement from
   Λ-hyperon spin correlations at high energy colliders
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW D
AB Spin correlations of A-hyperons embedded in the QCD strings formed in high energy collider experiments provide unique insight into their locality and entanglement features. We show from general considerations that, while the Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt inequality is less stringent for such states, they provide a benchmark for quantum-to-classical transitions induced by varying (i) the associated hadron multiplicity, (ii) the spin of nucleons, (iii) the separation in rapidity between pairs, and (iv) the kinematic regimes accessed. These studies also enable the extraction of quantitative measures of quantum entanglement. We first explore such questions within a simple model of a QCD string composed of singlets of two partial distinguishable fermion flavors and compare analytical results to those obtained on quantum hardware. We further discuss a class of spin Hamiltonians that model the dynamics of A spin correlations. Prospects for extracting quantum features of QCD strings from hyperon measurements at current and future colliders are outlined.

TI A nano-scale design of Vedic multiplier for electrocardiogram signal
   processing based on a quantum technology
SO APL MATERIALS
AB An electrocardiogram (ECG) measures the electric signals from the heartbeat to diagnose various heart issues; nevertheless, it is susceptible to noise. ECG signal noise must be removed because it significantly affects ECG signal characteristics. In addition, speed and occupied area play a fundamental role in ECG structures. The Vedic multiplier is an essential part of signal processing and is necessary for various applications, such as ECG, clusters, and finite impulse response filter architectures. All ECGs have a Vedic multiplier circuit unit that is necessary for signal processing. The Vedic multiplier circuit always performs multiplication and accumulation steps to execute continuous and complex operations in signal processing programs. Conversely, in the Vedic multiplier framework, the circuit speed and occupied area are the main limitations. Fixing these significant defects can drastically improve the performance of this crucial circuit. The use of quantum technologies is one of the most popular solutions to overcome all previous shortcomings, such as the high occupied area and speed. In other words, a unique quantum technology like quantum dot cellular automata (QCA) can easily overcome all previous shortcomings. Thus, based on quantum technology, this paper proposes a multiplier for ECG using carry skip adder, half-adder, and XOR circuits. All suggested frameworks utilized a single-layer design without rotated cells to increase their operability in complex architectures. All designs have been proposed with a coplanar configuration in view, having an impact on the circuits' durability and stability. All proposed architectures have been designed and validated with the tool QCADesigner 2.0.3. All designed circuits showed a simple structure with minimum quantum cells, minimum area, and minimum delay with respect to state-of-the-art structures.

Our main result is a necessary and sufficient criterion for when it is possible or impossible to discriminate quantum channels in an "interaction-free" manner (i.e., such that the discrimination error probability and the "interaction" probability can be made arbitrarily small). For the case where our condition holds, we devise an explicit protocol with the property that both probabilities approach zero with an increasing number of channel uses, N. More specifically, the "interaction" probability in our protocol decays as 1/N, and we show that this rate is the optimal achievable one. Furthermore, our protocol only needs at most one ancillary qubit and might thus be implementable in near-term experiments. For the case where our condition does not hold, we prove an inequality that quantifies the trade-off between the error probability and the "interaction" probability.

TI Fast decay of classification error in variational quantum circuits
SO QUANTUM SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB Variational quantum circuits (VQCs) have shown great potential in near-term applications. However, the discriminative power of a VQC, in connection to its circuit architecture and depth, is not understood. To unleash the genuine discriminative power of a VQC, we propose a VQC system with the optimal classical post-processing-maximum-likelihood estimation on measuring all VQC output qubits. Via extensive numerical simulations, we find that the error of VQC quantum data classification typically decays exponentially with the circuit depth, when the VQC architecture is extensive-the number of gates does not shrink with the circuit depth. This fast error suppression ends at the saturation towards the ultimate Helstrom limit of quantum state discrimination. On the other hand, non-extensive VQCs such as quantum convolutional neural networks are sub-optimal and fail to achieve the Helstrom limit, demonstrating a trade-off between ansatz complexity and classification performance in general. To achieve the best performance for a given VQC, the optimal classical post-processing is crucial even for a binary classification problem. To simplify VQCs for near-term implementations, we find that utilizing the symmetry of the input properly can improve the performance, while oversimplification can lead to degradation.

TI Experimental realization of entangled coherent states in two-dimensional
   harmonic oscillators of a trapped ion
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB Entangled coherent states play pivotal roles in various fields such as quantum computation, quantum communication, and quantum sensing. We experimentally demonstrate the generation of entangled coherent states with the two-dimensional motion of a trapped ion system. Using Raman transitions with appropriate detunings, we simultaneously drive the red and blue sidebands of the two transverse axes of a single trapped ion and observe multi-periodic entanglement and disentanglement of its spin and two-dimensional motion. Then, by measuring the spin state, we herald entangled coherent states of the transverse motions of the trapped ion and observe the corresponding modulation in the parity of the phonon distribution of one of the harmonic oscillators. Lastly, we trap two ions in a linear chain and realize M & oslash;lmer-S & oslash;rensen gate using two-dimensional motion.

TI Riemannian quantum circuit optimization for Hamiltonian simulation
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICS A-MATHEMATICAL AND THEORETICAL
AB Hamiltonian simulation, i.e. simulating the real time evolution of a target quantum system, is a natural application of quantum computing. Trotter-Suzuki splitting methods can generate corresponding quantum circuits; however, a faithful approximation can lead to relatively deep circuits. Here we start from the insight that for translation invariant systems, the gates in such circuit topologies can be further optimized on classical computers to decrease the circuit depth and/or increase the accuracy. We employ tensor network techniques and devise a method based on the Riemannian trust-region algorithm on the unitary matrix manifold for this purpose. For the Ising and Heisenberg models on a one-dimensional lattice, we achieve orders of magnitude accuracy improvements compared to fourth-order splitting methods. The optimized circuits could also be of practical use for the time-evolving block decimation algorithm.

TI Polarization Engineering of Entangled Photons from a Lithium Niobate
   Nonlinear Metasurface
SO NANO LETTERS
AB Complex polarization states of photon pairs are indispensable in various quantum technologies. Conventional methods for preparing desired two-photon polarization states are realized through bulky nonlinear crystals, which can restrict the versatility and tunability of the generated quantum states due to the fixed crystal nonlinear susceptibility. Here we present a solution using a nonlinear metasurface incorporating multiplexed silica metagratings on a lithium niobate film of 300 nm thickness. We fabricate two orthogonal metagratings on a single substrate with an identical resonant wavelength, thereby enabling the spectral indistinguishability of the emitted photons, and we demonstrate in experiments that the two-photon polarization states can be shaped by the metagrating orientation. Leveraging this essential property, we formulate a theoretical approach for generating arbitrary polarization-entangled qutrit states by combining three metagratings on a single metasurface, allowing the encoding of the desired quantum states or information. Our findings enable miniaturized optically controlled quantum devices by using ultrathin metasurfaces as polarization-entangled photon sources.

TI Error mitigation with Clifford quantum-circuit data
SO QUANTUM
AB Achieving near-term quantum advantage will require accurate estimation of quantum observables despite significant hardware noise. For this purpose, we propose a novel, scalable error-mitigation method that applies to gatebased quantum computers. The method generates training data {X-i(noisy), X-i(exact)} via quantum circuits composed largely of Clifford gates, which can be efficiently simulated classically, where X-i(noisy) and X-i(noisy) are noisy and noiseless observables respectively. Fitting a linear ansatz to this data then allows for the prediction of noise-free observables for arbitrary circuits. We analyze the performance of our method versus the number of qubits, circuit depth, and number of non-Clifford gates. We obtain an order-of-magnitude error reduction for a ground-state energy problem on 16 qubits in an IBMQ quantum computer and on a 64-qubit noisy simulator.

TI Resource-efficient quantum correlation measurements via multicopy neural
   network methods
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB Measuring complex properties in quantum systems, such as measures of quantum entanglement and Bell nonlocality, is inherently challenging. Traditional methods, like quantum state tomography (QST), require a full reconstruction of the density matrix for a given system and demand resources that scale exponentially with system size. We propose an alternative strategy that reduces the required information by combining multicopy measurements with artificial neural networks (ANNs), resulting in a 67% reduction in measurement requirements compared to QST. We have successfully measured two-qubit quantum correlations of Bell states subjected to a depolarizing channel (resulting in Werner states) and an amplitude-damping channel (leading to Horodecki states) using the multicopy approach on real quantum hardware. Our experiments, conducted with transmon qubits on IBMQ quantum processors, quantified the violation of Bell's inequality and the negativity of two-qubit entangled states. We compared these results with those obtained from the standard QST approach and applied a maximum likelihood method to mitigate noise. We trained ANNs to estimate degrees of entanglement and nonlocality measures using optimized sets of projections identified through Shapley's (SHAP) analysis for the Werner and Horodecki states. The ANN output, based on this reduced set of projections, aligns well with expected values and enhances noise robustness. This approach simplifies and improves the error robustness of multicopy measurements, eliminating the need for complex nonlinear equation analysis. It represents a significant advancement in AI-assisted quantum measurements, making the practical implementation on current quantum hardware more feasible. The experimental results demonstrate improved noise robustness on the current noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) hardware, representing a practical advance in resource-efficient characterization of quantum correlations.

TI Expressive quantum perceptrons for quantum neuromorphic computing
SO QUANTUM SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB Quantum neuromorphic computing (QNC) is a sub-field of quantum machine learning (QML) that capitalizes on inherent system dynamics. As a result, QNC can run on contemporary, noisy quantum hardware and is poised to realize challenging algorithms in the near term. One key issue in QNC is the characterization of the requisite dynamics for ensuring expressive quantum neuromorphic computation. We address this issue by adapting previous proposals of quantum perceptrons (QPs), a quantum version of a simplistic model for neural computation, to the QNC setting. Our QPs compute based on the analog dynamics of interacting qubits with tunable coupling constants. We show that QPs are, with restricted resources, a quantum equivalent to the classical perceptron, a simple mathematical model for a neuron that is the building block of various machine learning architectures. Moreover, we show that QPs are theoretically capable of producing any unitary operation. Thus, QPs are computationally more expressive than their classical counterparts. As a result, QNC architectures built using our QPs are, theoretically, universal. We introduce a technique for mitigating barren plateaus in QPs called entanglement thinning. We demonstrate QPs' effectiveness by applying them to numerous QML problems, including calculating the inner products between quantum states, energy measurements, and time reversal. Finally, we discuss potential implementations of QPs and how they can be used to build more complex QNC architectures such as quantum reservoir computers.

The qubit transition frequency exhibits periodic oscillations with the magnetic field, consistent with interference effects due to the magnetic flux threading the cross section of the proximitized semiconductor nanowire junction. As the induced superconductivity revives, additional coherent modes emerge at high magnetic fields, which we attribute to the interaction of the qubit and low-energy Andreev states.

Proposed bump consists of lead-indium alloy. The bumps land onto gold pad on the opposite chip and alloy with the gold pad for supercurrent. The primary advantage of the proposed bump is the minimized damage to the quantum chip. Plasma cleaning process which may degrade sensitive components is only required for bump chips and not for quantum chips. Lower bonding temperature of 100 degrees Celsius for the proposed bump also keeps sensitive components away from degradation in high temperature.

TI Entropy Accumulation Under Post-Quantum Cryptographic Assumptions
SO ENTROPY
AB In device-independent (DI) quantum protocols, security statements are agnostic to the internal workings of the quantum devices-they rely solely on classical interactions with the devices and specific assumptions. Traditionally, such protocols are set in a non-local scenario, where two non-communicating devices exhibit Bell inequality violations. Recently, a new class of DI protocols has emerged that requires only a single device. In this setting, the assumption of no communication is replaced by a computational one: the device cannot solve certain post-quantum cryptographic problems. Protocols developed in this single-device computational setting-such as for randomness certification-have relied on ad hoc techniques, making their guarantees difficult to compare and generalize. In this work, we introduce a modular proof framework inspired by techniques from the non-local DI literature. Our approach combines tools from quantum information theory, including entropic uncertainty relations and the entropy accumulation theorem, to yield both conceptual clarity and quantitative security guarantees. This framework provides a foundation for systematically analyzing DI protocols in the single-device setting under computational assumptions. It enables the design and security proof of future protocols for DI randomness generation, expansion, amplification, and key distribution, grounded in post-quantum cryptographic hardness.

AB Realizing quantum control and entanglement of particles is crucial for advancing both quantum technologies and fundamental science. Substantial developments in this domain have been achieved in a variety of systems1, 2, 3, 4-5. In this context, ultracold polar molecules offer new and unique opportunities because of their more complex internal structure associated with vibration and rotation, coupled with the existence of long-range interactions6,7. However, the same properties make molecules highly sensitive to their environment8, 9-10, affecting their coherence and utility in some applications. Here we show that by engineering an exceptionally controlled environment using rotationally magic11,12 optical tweezers, we can achieve long-lived entanglement between pairs of molecules using detectable hertz-scale interactions. We prepare two-molecule Bell states with fidelity 0.924-0.016+0.013\documentclass[12pt]{minimal} \usepackage{amsmath} \usepackage{wasysym} \usepackage{amsfonts} \usepackage{amssymb} \usepackage{amsbsy} \usepackage{mathrsfs} \usepackage{upgreek} \setlength{\oddsidemargin}{-69pt} \begin{document}$$0.92{4}_{-0.016}<^>{+0.013}$$\end{document}, limited by detectable leakage errors.

TI Sample-size-reduction of quantum states for the noisy linear problem
SO ANNALS OF PHYSICS
AB Quantum supremacy poses that a realistic quantum computer can perform a calculation that classical computers cannot in any reasonable amount of time. It has become a topic of significant research interest since the birth of the field, and it is intrinsically based on the efficient construction of quantum algorithms. It has been shown that there exists an expeditious way to solve the noisy linear (or learning with errors) problems in quantum machine learning theory via a well-posed quantum sampling over pure quantum states. In this paper, we propose an advanced method to reduce the sample size in the noisy linear structure, through a technique of randomizing quantum states, namely, epsilon- random technique. Particularly, we show that it is possible to reduce a quantum sample size in a quantum random access memory (QRAM) to the linearithmic order, in terms of the di-mensions of the input-data. Thus, we achieve a shorter run-time for the noisy linear problem.(c) 2023 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI Brauer Analysis of Some Cayley and Nilpotent Graphs and Its Application
   in Quantum Entanglement Theory
SO SYMMETRY-BASEL
AB Cayley and nilpotent graphs arise from the interaction between graph theory and algebra and are used to visualize the structures of some algebraic objects as groups and commutative rings. On the other hand, Green and Schroll introduced Brauer graph algebras and Brauer configuration algebras to investigate the algebras of tame and wild representation types. An appropriated system of multisets (called a Brauer configuration) induces these algebras via a suitable bounded quiver (or bounded directed graph), and the combinatorial properties of such multisets describe corresponding indecomposable projective modules, the dimensions of the algebras and their centers. Undirected graphs are examples of Brauer configuration messages, and the description of the related data for their induced Brauer configuration algebras is said to be the Brauer analysis of the graph. This paper gives closed formulas for the dimensions of Brauer configuration algebras (and their centers) induced by Cayley and nilpotent graphs defined by some finite groups and finite commutative rings. These procedures allow us to give examples of Hamiltonian digraph constructions based on Cayley graphs. As an application, some quantum entangled states (e.g., Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger and Dicke states) are described and analyzed as suitable Brauer messages.

TI Pareto-optimality of pulses for robust population transfer in a

SO EPJ QUANTUM TECHNOLOGY
AB Frequency-modulation schemes offer an alternative to standard Rabi pulses for realizing robust quantum operations. In this work, we investigate short-duration population transfer between the ground and first excited states of a ladder-type qutrit, with the goal of minimizing leakage into the second excited state. Our multiobjective approach seeks to reduce the maximum transient second-state population and maximize detuning robustness. Inspired by two-state models-such as the Allen-Eberly and Hioe-Carroll models-we extend these concepts to our system, exploring a range of pulse families, including those with super-Gaussian envelopes and polynomial detuning functions. We identify Pareto fronts for pulse models constructed from one of two envelope functions paired with one of four detuning functions. We then analyze how each Pareto-optimal pulse parameter influences the two Pareto objectives as well as amplitude robustness.

TI Emerging Diamond Quantum Sensing in Bio-Membranes
SO MEMBRANES
AB Bio-membranes exhibit complex but unique mechanical properties as communicative regulators in various physiological and pathological processes. Exposed to a dynamic micro-environment, bio-membranes can be seen as an intricate and delicate system. The systematical modeling and detection of their local physical properties are often difficult to achieve, both quantitatively and precisely. The recent emerging diamonds hosting quantum defects (i.e., nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center) demonstrate intriguing optical and spin properties, together with their outstanding photostability and biocompatibility, rendering them ideal candidates for biological applications. Notably, the extraordinary spin-based sensing enable the measurements of localized nanoscale physical quantities such as magnetic fields, electrical fields, temperature, and strain. These nanoscale signals can be optically read out precisely by simple optical microscopy systems. Given these exclusive properties, NV-center-based quantum sensors can be widely applied in exploring bio-membrane-related features and the communicative chemical reaction processes.

TI Finding Key Nodes in Complex Networks Through Quantum Deep Reinforcement
   Learning
SO ENTROPY
AB Identifying key nodes in networks is a fundamental problem in network science. This study proposes a quantum deep reinforcement learning (QDRL) framework that integrates reinforcement learning with a variational quantum graph neural network, effectively identifying distributed influential nodes while preserving the network's fundamental topological properties. By leveraging principles of quantum computing, our method is designed to reduce model parameters and computational complexity compared to traditional neural networks. Trained on small networks, it demonstrated strong generalization across diverse scenarios. We compared the proposed algorithm with some classical node ranking and network dismantling algorithms on various synthetical and empirical networks. The results suggest that the proposed algorithm outperforms existing baseline methods. Moreover, in synthetic networks based on Erd & odblac;s-R & eacute;nyi and Watts-Strogatz models, QDRL demonstrated its capability to alleviate the issue of localization in network information propagation and node influence ranking. Our research provides insights into addressing fundamental problems in complex networks using quantum machine learning, demonstrating the potential of quantum approaches for network analysis tasks.

TI Robust Quantum Reservoir Learning for Molecular Property Prediction
SO JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL INFORMATION AND MODELING
AB Machine learning has been increasingly utilized in the field of biomedical research to accelerate the drug discovery process. In recent years, the emergence of quantum computing has led to the extensive exploration of quantum machine learning algorithms. Quantum variational machine learning algorithms are currently the most prevalent, but they face issues with trainability due to vanishing gradients. An emerging alternative is the quantum reservoir computing (QRC) approach, in which the quantum algorithm does not require gradient evaluation on the quantum hardware. Motivated by the potential advantages of the QRC method, we apply it to predict the biological activity of potential drug molecules based on molecular descriptors. We observe more robust QRC performance as the size of the data set decreases, compared to standard classical models, a quality of potential interest for pharmaceutical data sets of limited size. In addition, we leverage the uniform manifold approximation and projection technique to analyze structural changes as classical features are transformed through quantum dynamics, and we find that quantum reservoir embeddings provide better separability between active and inactive compounds in the low-dimensional learned feature space.

AB This paper examines a way to simplify the circuit of quantum random walk search algorithm, when the traversing coin is constructed by both generalized Householder reflection and an additional phase multiplier. If an appropriate relation between corresponding parameters is realized, our algorithm becomes more robust to de-viations in the phases. In this modification marking coin is not needed, and all advantages from above mentioned optimization to the stability, are preserved. It is shown explicitly how to construct such walk coin in order to obtain more robust quantum algorithm.

TI Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill Encoding in Continuous Modal Variables of
   Single Photons
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB GKP states, introduced by Gottesman, Kitaev, and Preskill, are continuous variable logical qubits that can be corrected for errors caused by phase space displacements. Their experimental realization is challenging, in particular, using propagating fields, where quantum information is encoded in the quadratures of the electromagnetic field. However, traveling photons are essential in many applications of GKP codes involving the long-distance transmission of quantum information. We introduce a new method for encoding GKP states in propagating fields using single photons, each occupying a distinct auxiliary mode given by the propagation direction. The GKP states are defined as highly correlated states described by collective continuous modes, as time and frequency. We analyze how the error detection and correction protocol scales with the total photon number and the spectral width. We show that the obtained code can be corrected for displacements in time-frequency phase space, which correspond to dephasing, or rotations, in the quadrature phase space and to photon losses. Most importantly, we show that generating two-photon GKP states is relatively simple, and that such states are currently produced and manipulated in several photonic platforms where frequency and time-bin biphoton entangled states can be engineered.

TI Noise-resistant quantum communications using hyperentanglement
SO OPTICA
AB Quantum information protocols are being deployed in increasingly practical scenarios, via optical fibers or free space, alongside classical communications channels. However, entanglement, the most critical resource to deploy to the communicating parties, is also the most fragile to the noise-induced degradations. Here we show that polarization-frequency hyperentanglement of photons can be effectively employed to enable noise-resistant distribution of polarization entanglement through noisy quantum channels. In particular, we demonstrate that our hyperentanglement-based scheme results in an orders-of-magnitude increase in the SNR for distribution of polarization-entangled qubit pairs, enabling quantum communications even in the presence of strong noise that would otherwise preclude quantum operations due to noise-induced entanglement sudden death. While recent years have witnessed tremendous interest and progress in long-distance quantum communications, previous attempts to deal with the noise have mostly been focused on passive noise suppression in quantum channels. Here, via the use of hyperentangled degrees of freedom, we pave the way toward a universally adoptable strategy to enable entanglement-based quantum communications via strongly noisy quantum channels.

TI Nuclear Spins in a Solid Exceeding 10-Hour Coherence Times for
   Ultra-Long-Term Quantum Storage
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB Long-term quantum storage for quantum communication applications will require optically accessible states with coherence times exceeding the desired storage time. Ground-state hyperfine levels in Eu3+:Y2SiO5 have previously shown coherence times as long as 6 h at 1.4 K when operated at a zero-firstorder-Zeeman (ZEFOZ) point. Here, we have characterized the limiting decoherence mechanisms acting in this regime, which shows that the coherence time is limited by the presence of spin impurities. This dephasing effect has been suppressed by cooling the sample to 125 mK, resulting in an extension in the coherence time to over 13 h. In the absence of these impurities, the dominant source of dephasing is the field inhomogeneity of the ZEFOZ point arising from the spin inhomogeneous broadening. We have shown that coherence times over 18 h can be achieved by operating using a spectrally narrow subensemble selected from within the inhomogeneous line. The observed coherence time is longer than that of any other system suitable for an optical quantum memory. Furthermore, at a much higher temperature of 6 K, we have realized a 6-h coherence time, which has been obtainable using single-stage cryocoolers. These results imply advanced engineering feasibility in designing and operating future quantum information-storage devices for a wide range of applications, including in satellites.

TI High Coherence Times in NV-Doped Diamond Films for Quantum Sensing
SO PHYSICA STATUS SOLIDI A-APPLICATIONS AND MATERIALS SCIENCE
AB Nitrogen vacancy centers in diamond provide an attractive platform for quantum sensing because of their long spin coherence at room temperature and the possibility of optical spin initialization and readout. For high sensitivity, these centers need to be located close to the signal source, such as magnetic nanoparticles, while still enabling large-area measurements. This requires thin diamond layers with controlled incorporation of nitrogen and minimal crystal defects. In this study, we report on the growth and characterization of diamond films with (100) orientation produced by microwave plasma-assisted chemical vapor deposition. The films exhibit sharp interfaces and long spin coherence times above one hundred microseconds, despite thicknesses of only a few micrometers. By combining isotopic enrichment with controlled nitrogen incorporation, we demonstrate that the coherence times are mainly limited by the spin bath of substitutional nitrogen. The best samples reach dephasing times of 6.3 microseconds, close to the theoretical limit set by the substitutional nitrogen concentration, which indicates minimal strain in the layers. While bulk crystals can exhibit longer coherence times, our results highlight that thin, uniform films with engineered spin environments provide advantages for integration into scalable quantum sensing devices.

TI INFEASIBILITY OF CONSTRUCTING A SPECIAL ORTHOGONAL MATRIX FOR THE
   DETERMINISTIC REMOTE PREPARATION STATE OF AN ARBITRARY N-QUBIT STATE
SO QUANTUM INFORMATION & COMPUTATION
AB In this paper, we present a polynomial-complexity algorithm to construct a special orthogonal matrix for the deterministic remote state preparation (DRSP) of an arbitrary n-qubit state, and prove that if n > 3, such matrices do not exist. Firstly, the construction problem is split into two sub-problems, i.e., finding a solution of a semi-orthogonal matrix and generating all semi-orthogonal matrices. Through giving the definitions and properties of the matching operators, it is proved that the orthogonality of a special matrix is equivalent to the cooperation of multiple matching operators, and then the construction problem is reduced to the problem of solving an XOR linear equation system, which reduces the construction complexity from exponential to polynomial level. Having proved that each semi-orthogonal matrix can be simplified into a unique form, we use the proposed algorithm to confirm that the unique form does not have any solution when n > 3, which means it is infeasible to construct such a special orthogonal matrix for the DRSP of an arbitrary n-qubit state.

TI Quantum Meets Fine-Grained Complexity: Sublinear Time Quantum Algorithms

AB Longest common substring (LCS), longest palindrome substring (LPS), and Ulam distance (UL) are three fundamental string problems that can be classically solved in near linear time. In this work, we present sublinear time quantum algorithms for these problems along with quantum lower bounds. Our results shed light on a very surprising fact: Although the classic solutions for LCS and LPS are almost identical (via suffix trees), their quantum computational complexities are different. While we give an exact o (root n) time algoritham for LPS, we prove that LCS needs at least time omega(sic) (n(2/3 )) even for 0/1 strings.

TI Electromagnetically induced transparency via localized surface plasmon
   mode-assisted hybrid cavity QED
SO CHINESE PHYSICS B
AB In recent years, most studies have focused on the perfect absorption and high-efficiency quantum memory of the one-sided system, ignoring the characteristics of its optical switching contrast. Thus, the performance of all-optical switching and optical transistors is limited. Herein, we propose a localized surface plasmon (LSP) mode-assisted cavity QED system which consists of a Lambda-shaped three-level quantum emitter (QE), a metal nanoparticle and a one-sided optical cavity with a fully reflected mirror. In this system, the QE coherently couples to the cavity and LSP mode respectively, which is manipulated by the control field. As a result, considerably high and stable switch contrast of 90% can be achievable due to the strong confined field of the LSP mode and perfect absorption of the optical medium. In addition, we obtain a power dependent effect between the control field and the transmitted frequency as a result of the converted dark state. We employ the Heisenberg-Langevin equation and numerical master equation formalisms to explain high switching, controllable output light and the dark state. Our system introduces an effective method to improve the performance of optical switches based on the one-sided system in quantum information storage and quantum communication.

TI Two-Photon Interface of Nuclear Spins Based on the Optonuclear
   Quadrupolar Effect
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW X
AB Photons and nuclear spins are two well-known building blocks in quantum information science and technology. Establishing an efficient interface between optical photons and nuclear spins, while highly desirable for hybridizing these two quantum systems, is challenging, because the interactions between nuclear spins and the environment are usually weak in magnitude, and there is also a formidable gap between nuclear spin frequencies and optical frequencies. In this work, we propose an optonuclear quadrupolar (ONQ) effect, whereby optical photons can be efficiently coupled to nuclear spins, similar to Raman scattering. Compared to previous works, ancilla electron spins are not required for the ONQ effect. This leads to advantages such as applicability in defect-free nonmagnetic crystals and longer nuclear spin coherence time. In addition, the frequency of the optical photons can be arbitrary, so they can be fine-tuned to minimize the material heating and to match telecom wavelengths for long-distance communications. Using perturbation theory and first-principles calculations, we demonstrate that the ONQ effect is stronger by several orders of magnitude than other nonlinear optical effects that could couple to nuclear spins. Based on this rationale, we propose promising applications of the ONQ effect, including quantum memory, quantum transduction, and materials isotope spectroscopy. We also discuss issues relevant to the experimental demonstration of the ONQ effect.

TI Encoding trade-offs and design toolkits in quantum algorithms for
   discrete optimization: coloring, routing, scheduling, and other problems
SO QUANTUM
AB Challenging combinatorial optimization problems are ubiquitous in science and engineering. Several quantum methods for optimization have recently been developed, in different settings including both exact and approximate solvers. Addressing this field of research, this manuscript has three distinct purposes. First, we present an intuitive method for synthesizing and analyzing discrete (i.e., integer based) optimization problems, wherein the problem and corresponding algorithmic primitives are expressed using a discrete quantum intermediate representation (DQIR) that is encoding-independent. This compact representation often allows for more efficient problem compilation, automated analyses of different encoding choices, easier interpretability, more complex runtime procedures, and richer programmability, as compared to previous approaches, which we demonstrate with a number of examples. Second, we perform numerical studies comparing several qubit encodings; the results exhibit a number of preliminary trends that help guide the choice of encoding for a particular set of hardware and a particular problem and algorithm. Our study includes problems related to graph coloring, the traveling salesperson problem, factory/machine scheduling, financial portfolio rebalancing, and integer linear programming. Third, we design low-depth graph-derived partial mixers (GDPMs) up to 16-level quantum variables, demonstrating that compact (bi nary) encodings are more amenable to QAOA than previously understood. We expect this toolkit of programming ab- stractions and low-level building blocks to aid in designing quantum algorithms for discrete combinatorial problems.

TI Entanglement and Bell inequalities with boosted tt
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW D
AB The Large Hadron Collider provides a unique opportunity to study quantum entanglement and violation of Bell inequalities at the highest energy available today. In this paper, we will investigate these quantum correlations with top quark pair production, which represents a system of two-qubits. The semileptonic top pair channel has a factor of 6 increase in statistics and easier reconstruction with respect to the dileptonic channel. Although measuring the spin polarization of the hadronic top quark is known to be challenging, our study indicates that it is feasible to reconstruct the spin density matrix of the two-qubit system using an optimal hadronic polarimeter. This is achieved with the aid of jet substructure techniques and NN-inspired reconstruction methods, which improve the mapping between subjets and quarks. We find that entanglement can already be observed at more than the 5 sigma level with existing data, and violation of Bell inequalities may be probed above the 4 sigma level at the HL-LHC with 3 ab-1 of data.

TI Fast generation of cat states in Kerr nonlinear resonators via optimal
   adiabatic control
SO NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB Macroscopic cat states have been widely studied to illustrate fundamental principles of quantum physics as well as their applications in quantum information processing. In this paper, we propose a quantum speed-up method for the creation of cat states in a Kerr nonlinear resonator (KNR) via optimal adiabatic control. By simultaneously adiabatic tuning the cavity-field detuning and driving field strength, the width of the minimum energy gap between the target trajectory and non-adiabatic trajectory can be widened, which allows us to accelerate the evolution along the adiabatic path. Compared with the previous proposal, preparing cat states only by controlling two-photon pumping strength, our method can prepare the target state with a shorter time, a high-fidelity and a large non-classical volume. It is worth noting that the cat state prepared here is also robust against single-photon loss. Moreover, when we consider the KNR with a large initial detuning, our proposal will create a large-size cat state successfully. This proposal for preparing cat states can be implemented in superconducting quantum circuits, which provides a quantum state resource for quantum information encoding and fault-tolerant quantum computing.

TI Quantum Light Source Based on Semiconductor Quantum Dots: A Review
SO PHOTONICS
AB Quantum light sources that generate single photons and entangled photons have important applications in the fields of secure quantum communication and linear optical quantum computing. Self-assembled semiconductor quantum dots, also known as "artificial atoms", have discrete energy-level structures due to electronic confinement in all three spatial dimensions. It has the advantages of high stability, high brightness, deterministic, and tunable emission wavelength, and is easy to integrate into an optical microcavity with a high-quality factor, which can realize a high-performance quantum light source. In this paper, we first introduce the generation principles, properties, and applications of single-photon sources in the field of quantum information and then present implementations and development of quantum light sources in self-assembled semiconductor quantum dot materials. Finally, we conclude with an outlook on the future development of semiconductor quantum dot quantum light sources.

TI Dynamical Phases and Quantum Correlations in an Emitter-Waveguide System
   with Feedback
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB We investigate the creation and control of emergent collective behavior and quantum correlations using feedback in an emitter-waveguide system using a minimal model. Employing homodyne detection of photons emitted from a laser-driven emitter ensemble into the modes of a waveguide allows for the generation of intricate dynamical phases. In particular, we show the emergence of a time-crystal phase, the transition to which is controlled by the feedback strength. Feedback enables furthermore the control of many-body quantum correlations, which become manifest in spin squeezing in the emitter ensemble. Developing a theory for the dynamics of fluctuation operators we discuss how the feedback strength controls the squeezing and investigate its temporal dynamics and dependence on system size. The largely analytical results allow to quantify spin squeezing and fluctuations in the limit of large number of emitters, revealing critical scaling of the squeezing close to the transition to the time crystal. Our study corroborates the potential of integrated emitter-waveguide systems-which feature highly controllable photon emission channels-for the exploration of collective quantum phenomena and the generation of resources, such as squeezed states, for quantum enhanced metrology.

TI Device-independent quantum key distribution from generalized CHSH
   inequalities
SO QUANTUM
AB Device-independent quantum key distribution aims at providing security guarantees even when using largely uncharacterised devices. In the simplest scenario, these guarantees are derived from the CHSH score, which is a simple linear combination of four correlation functions. We here derive a security proof from a generalisation of the CHSH score, which effectively takes into account the individual values of two correlation functions. We show that this additional information, which is anyway available in practice, allows one to get higher key rates than with the CHSH score. We discuss the potential advantage of this technique for realistic photonic implementations of device-independent quantum key distribution.

TI Super-resolution Quantum Imaging of N-photon Entangled
   N00N State with High Resolution and High Detection
   Efficiency Based on Centroid Method
SO CHINESE JOURNAL OF LASERS-ZHONGGUO JIGUANG
AB Objective As a breakthrough technology in recent years, super-resolution imaging has become an important research problem in computer vision and image processing and has wide practical applications in medical, biological, security, and other fields. However,classical imaging technology is limited by the diffraction resolution limit, and it is difficult to achieve resolution breakthroughs.Quantum entanglement can transcend diffraction resolution limits by sharpening spatial interference fringes based on quantum technology evolution . The entangled N00N state has been studied because it can exceed the standard quantum limit. The interference visibility of the three-photon N00N state is higher than the limit of classical spatial super-resolution, and the pattern of the N-photon entangled N00N state is N times finer than that of classical light. Thus, the N00N state can improve the resolution of the optical system by N times. However, the probability of all N photons arriving at the same location and the detection efficiency decreases exponentially with increasing N, making the advantages of the N00N state controversial. The optical centroid measurement (OCM)promotes the application of the N00N state in super-resolution imaging. This study further applies the advantages of N-photon entangled N00N state to super-resolution quantum imaging based on existing theories and technologies. This study further proposes a new quantum imaging system to improve the resolution of object imaging.
   Methods This study primarily adopts theoretical analysis and simulation methods. A simulation model based on the proposed quantum imaging system is created, and the resolution enhancement of our scheme is quantified by measuring the modulation transfer function (MTF). A photon source model is constructed to generate coherent photons that are irradiated onto the object and transmitted to the receiver. The centroid position of the photons is measured using the OCM method, and the point spread function (PSF) of the imaging system is calculated using the obtained simulation data. Finally, the MTF is obtained using the Fourier transform method. In addition to the theoretical analysis of the detection efficiency enhancement of N00N state by OCM, the advantages of OCM visibility are analyzed through simulation visibility. The data are obtained through model simulation, and the curve is fitted to the data point,following the visibility calculation and analysis using the fitted curve.
   Results and DiscussionsThe model simulation of the proposed imaging system shows that the MTF curve decreases with the increase of spatial frequency. However, the entangled two-photon curve changes more gently than the spatially uncorrelated two-photon curve, indicating that the resolution of entangled two-photon imaging is better than that of uncorrelated two-photon imaging.Similarly, the presence of more entangled photons changes the curve at a slower pace. The resolution of (16 +/- 2)% is enhanced in the two-photon N00N entangled state, and the resolutions of 4 and 8 photons are (30 +/- 3)%, and (41 +/- 2)%, respectively (Fig.2 and Table 1). The results verify the feasibility of the OCM imaging scheme for N-photon entangled N00N state super-resolution imaging.Moreover, the resolution can be enhanced by increasing the number of photons. The visibilities obtained by OCM for classical light and N00N entangled light are compared. The visibility decreases significantly as the number of photons of classical light increases from 2 to 4. The visibilities of 2,3 and 4 photons are (45 +/- 5)%,(17 +/- 4)%, and (12 +/- 2)%, respectively, whereas the visibility obtained by OCM for N00N entangled light remains relatively constant. The obtained visibilities of 2,3, and 4 photons are (50 +/- 4)%,(44 +/- 2)%, and (42 +/- 4)%, respectively (Fig.3), achieving improved visibility.
   Conclusions The quantum imaging system scheme presented in this study improves the detection efficiency of N00N state by means of optical centroid measurement, and exploits the N-photon entanglement of N00N state to realize super-resolution imaging of objects. OCM does not require all photons to reach the same point in space as compared to the N-photon absorption scheme. The resolution of any number of photons can be improved by photon counting and proper post-processing, which significantly improves the detection efficiency of N00N entangled states. Moreover, the visibility of the OCM signal in N00N state is almost independent of the change in photon number N; therefore, the imaging system is suitable for higher photon numbers. The super-resolution quantum imaging system based on N-photon entanglement overcomes the problem in effectively detecting N-photon states, which improves quantum-enhanced measurement. Moreover, it is significant for Heisenberg finite phase detection and the development of super-resolution quantum imaging. Theoretically, the system can enhance N-1 times of image resolution. The prepared N00N state has high fidelity and stability. Thus, it is expected to be more commonly applied in research and promote new progress in the field of super-resolution quantum imaging.

TI Quantum-Inspired Fourier Transforms Based on Circuits
SO ADVANCED SCIENCE
AB Fourier transform (FT) is ubiquitous in modern society due to their broad applications in many branches of science and engineering. Improving the speed of FT is a common interest in the fields of signal processing. The quantum FT is generally believed to be superior to classical algorithms, but it requires a special quantum environment to perform, which has not yet been widely used. Inspired by quantum FT, here a new FT scheme is demonstrated based on circuits. In the circuit scheme, a new type of classical correlation, which its mathematical form corresponds to those of quantum entanglement, has been constructed. The calculation speed using the designed circuit scheme is equivalent to those based on the quantum FT algorithms, which is faster than those based on the classical fast FT algorithms. Furthermore, some basic gates have been designed and experimentally fabricated using classical circuit networks, which can emulate the functions of quantum gates. Fast calculation efficiencies for the FT based on the designed classical circuit networks have been demonstrated. Extensive applications of the FT scheme in the signal processing are anticipated.

TI Quantum key distribution with multiphoton pulses: an advantage
SO OPTICS CONTINUUM
AB In this article, we introduce a quantum key distribution protocol for the line of sight channels based on coincidence measurements. We present a proof-of-concept implementation of our protocol. We show that using coincidence measurements to monitor multi-photon pulses results in a higher secure key rate over longer distances for such channels. This key rate is higher than popular implementations of quantum key distribution protocol based on BB84, for example, the GLLP analysis [Quant. Info. Comput. 4, 325 (2004) ]. In the experiment, we could generate around 74% more key bits per signal pulse as compared to the GLLP analysis of BB84 protocol with similar parameters and equal value of mean photon number.

TI Source-Replacement Model for Phase-Matching Quantum Key Distribution
SO ADVANCED QUANTUM TECHNOLOGIES
AB Quantum key distribution has emerged as a promising solution for constructing secure communication networks, with its information-theoretic security rooted in quantum mechanics. One of the recent quantum key distribution protocols, the phase-matching protocol, can have a quadratic key-rate improvement. Its security was initially established using an abstract method known as symmetry-protected privacy. In this study, this security is reevaluated under the more intuitive source-replacement model, arriving at the same conclusions as the original proof. This model provides a fresh perspective on the protocol's security. As an application of this approach, a beam-splitting attack is introduced. Leveraging the source-replacement model, a lower bound on the phase error rate under this attack is derived, further underscoring the robustness of our security analysis method.

TI Quantum Annealing Designs Nonhemolytic Antimicrobial Peptides in a
   Discrete Latent Space
SO ACS MEDICINAL CHEMISTRY LETTERS
AB Increasing the variety of antimicrobial peptides is crucial in meeting the global challenge of multi-drug-resistant bacterial pathogens. While several deep-learning-based peptide design pipelines are reported, they may not be optimal in data efficiency. High efficiency requires a well compressed latent space, where optimization is likely to fail due to numerous local minima. We present a multi-objective peptide design pipeline based on a discrete latent space and D-Wave quantum annealer with the aim of solving the local minima problem. To achieve multi-objective optimization, multiple peptide properties are encoded into a score using non-dominated sorting. Our pipeline is applied to design therapeutic peptides that are antimicrobial and non-hemolytic at the same time. From 200 000 peptides designed by our pipeline, four peptides proceeded to wet-lab validation. Three of them showed high anti-microbial activity, and two are non-hemolytic. Our results demonstrate how quantum-based optimizers can be taken advantage of in real-world medical studies.

TI One-dimensional continuous-time quantum Markov chains: qubit

AB Quantum Markov chains (QMCs) are positive maps on a trace-class space describing open quantum dynamics on graphs. Such objects have a statistical resemblance with classical random walks, while at the same time they allow for internal (quantum) degrees of freedom. In this work we study continuous-time QMCs on the integer line, half-line and finite segments, so that we are able to obtain exact probability calculations in terms of the associated matrix-valued orthogonal polynomials and measures. The methods employed here are applicable to a wide range of settings, but we will restrict ourselves to classes of examples for which the Lindblad generators are induced by a single positive map, and such that the Stieltjes transforms of the measures and their inverses can be calculated explicitly.

TI Sudden death and revival of Gaussian Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen steering in
   noisy channels
SO NPJ QUANTUM INFORMATION
AB Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR) steering is a useful resource for secure quantum information tasks. It is crucial to investigate the effect of inevitable loss and noise in quantum channels on EPR steering. We analyze and experimentally demonstrate the influence of purity of quantum states and excess noise on Gaussian EPR steering by distributing a two-mode squeezed state through lossy and noisy channels, respectively. We show that the impurity of state never leads to sudden death of Gaussian EPR steering, but the noise in quantum channel can. Then we revive the disappeared Gaussian EPR steering by establishing a correlated noisy channel. Different from entanglement, the sudden death and revival of Gaussian EPR steering are directional. Our result confirms that EPR steering criteria proposed by Reid and I. Kogias et al. are equivalent in our case. The presented results pave way for asymmetric quantum information processing exploiting Gaussian EPR steering in noisy environment.

TI Free Space Measurement Device Independent Quantum Key Distribution with
   Modulating Retro-Reflectors under Correlated Turbulent Channel
SO ENTROPY
AB Modulating retro-reflector (MRR), originally introduced to support laser communication, relieves most of the weight, power, and pointing requirements to the ground station. In this paper, a plug-and-play measurement device independent quantum key distribution (MDI-QKD) scheme with MRR is proposed not only to eliminate detector side channels and allow an untrusted satellite relay between two users, but also to simplify the requirements set-ups in practical flexible moving scenarios. The plug-and-play architecture compensates for the polarization drift during the transmission to provide superior performance in implementing the MDI-QKD on a free-space channel, and the MRR device is adopted to relax the requirements on both communication terminals. A double-pass correlated turbulent channel model is presented to investigate the complex and unstable channel characteristics caused by the atmospheric turbulence. Furthermore, the security of the modified MDI-QKD scheme is analyzed under some classical attacks and the simulation results indicate the feasibility under the situation that the system performance deteriorates with the increase of fading correlation coefficient and the turbulence intensity, which provides a meaningful step towards an MDI-QKD based on the moving platforms to join a dynamic quantum network with untrusted relays.

TI Tight quantum depth lower bound for solving systems of linear equations
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Since Harrow et al. [A. W. Harrow, A. Hassidim, and S. Lloyd, Phys. Rev. Lett. 103 , 150502 (2009)] showed that a system of linear equations with N variables and condition number kappa can be solved on a quantum computer in poly[log( N ) , kappa ] time, exponentially faster than any classical algorithms, its improvements and applications have been extensively investigated. The state-of-the-art quantum algorithm for this problem is due to Costa et al. [P. C. S. Costa, D. An, Y. R. Sanders, Y. Su, R. Babbush, and D. W. Berry, PRX Quantum 3 , 040303 (2022)], with optimal query complexity Theta( kappa ). An important question that is left is whether parallelism can bring further optimization. In this paper, we study the limitation of parallel quantum computing on this problem. We show that any quantum algorithm for solving systems of linear equations with time complexity poly[log( N ) , kappa ] has a lower bound of Omega( kappa ) on the depth of queries, which is tight up to a constant factor.

TI Field Theory of Charge Sharpening in Symmetric Monitored Quantum
   Circuits
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB Monitored quantum circuits (MRCs) exhibit a measurement-induced phase transition between area-law and volume-law entanglement scaling. MRCs with a conserved charge additionally exhibit two distinct volume-law entangled phases that cannot be characterized by equilibrium notions of symmetry-breaking or topological order, but rather by the nonequilibrium dynamics and steady-state distribution of charge fluctuations. These include a charge-fuzzy phase in which charge information is rapidly scrambled leading to slowly decaying spatial fluctuations of charge in the steady state, and a charge-sharp phase in which measurements collapse quantum fluctuations of charge without destroying the volume-law entanglement of neutral degrees of freedom. By taking a continuous-time, weak-measurement limit, we construct a controlled replica field theory description of these phases and their intervening charge-sharpening transition in one spatial dimension. We find that the charge fuzzy phase is a critical phase with continuously evolving critical exponents that terminates in a modified Kosterlitz-Thouless transition to the short-range correlated charge-sharp phase. We numerically corroborate these scaling predictions also hold for discrete-time projective-measurement circuit models using large-scale matrix-product state simulations, and discuss generalizations to higher dimensions.

Here we consider the effects of quantum coherence and quantum entanglement for the quantum walk search on the complete bipartite graph. First, we numerically show the complementary relationship between the success probability and the two quantum resources (quantum coherence and quantum entanglement). We also provide theoretical analysis in the asymptotic scenarios. At last, we discuss the role played by generalized depolarizing noises and find that it would influence the dynamics of success probability and quantum coherence sharply, which is demonstrated by theoretical derivation and numerical simulation.

TI Capacity of trace decreasing quantum operations and superadditivity of
   coherent information for a generalized erasure channel
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICS A-MATHEMATICAL AND THEORETICAL
AB Losses in quantum communication lines severely affect the rates of reliable information transmission and are usually considered to be state-independent. However, the loss probability does depend on the system state in general, with the polarization dependent losses being a prominent example. Here we analyze biased trace decreasing quantum operations that assign different loss probabilities to states and introduce the concept of a generalized erasure channel. We find lower and upper bounds for the classical and quantum capacities of the generalized erasure channel as well as characterize its degradability and antidegradability. We reveal superadditivity of coherent information in the case of the polarization dependent losses, with the difference between the two-letter quantum capacity and the single-letter quantum capacity exceeding 7.197 x 10(-3) bits per qubit sent, the greatest value among qubit-input channels reported so far.

We measure a Purcell factor of F-exp = 6.9 +/- 0.9 for a cavity quality factor of about 10,000, allowing us to observe clear signatures of coherent scattering of photons by the quantum dots. We show how this integrated system can coherently reroute photons between the drop and bus ports and how this routing is controlled by detuning the quantum dot and resonator or through the strength of the excitation beam, where a critical photon number less than one photon per lifetime is required. We discuss the strengths and limitations of this approach, focusing on how the coherent scattering and single-photon nonlinearity can be used to increase the efficiency of quantum devices such as routers or Bell-state analyzers.

TI Nice Error Basis and Quantum Channel
SO OPEN SYSTEMS & INFORMATION DYNAMICS
AB The Weyl operators give a convenient basis of Mn(DOUBLE-STRUCK CAPITAL C) which is also orthonormal with respect to the Hilbert-Schmidt inner product. The properties of such a basis can be generalised to the notion of a nice error basis (NEB), as introduced by E. Knill [3]. We can use an NEB of Mn(DOUBLE-STRUCK CAPITAL C) to construct an NEB for Lin(Mn(DOUBLE-STRUCK CAPITAL C)), the space of linear maps on Mn(DOUBLE-STRUCK CAPITAL C). Any linear map will then correspond to a n2 x n2 coefficient matrix in the basis decomposition with respect to such an NEB of Lin(Mn(DOUBLE-STRUCK CAPITAL C)). Positivity, complete (co)positivity or other properties of a linear map can be characterised in terms of such a coefficient matrix.

TI Coherent phonon source based on electron spin resonance in a quantum-dot
   qubit
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB One of the key requirements for quantum phononics, especially for scenarios involving quantum communication and quantum-state transduction, is the implementation of a controlled phonon source, ultimately with the capacity to source single phonons at some desired generation rate. In this article, we describe a scheme for the controlled sourcing of phonons that exploits an electron-spin resonance between the Zeeman-split levels of a gated quantum dot. This on-chip scheme allows for broad tunability of the energy of the generated phonons, with convenient electrical control. By providing a compact and coherent source, this scheme is also well suited to the construction of more-extended phononic circuits, involving the sourcing, transmission and detection of phononic signals.

TI Energy-Degenerate Photon-Pair Generation from Individual
   CsPbBr3 Quantum Dots
SO NANO LETTERS
AB Beyond single-photon emission, generating correlated N-photon bundles, e.g., a photon pair, is essential for various quantum technologies including quantum teleportation and metrology. A widely explored approach exploits the radiative biexciton cascade in individual (mainly epitaxially grown) quantum dots (QDs). Here, we investigate such a cascade in colloidal CsPbBr3 QDs, a scalable and solution-processable quantum-light emitter. By matching their size-dependent biexciton binding energies to their size-independent phonon energies, we demonstrate the generation of time-correlated and energy-degenerate photon pairs in large (>15 nm) QDs. Under pulsed excitation at 4 K, we observe pronounced photon bunching, with a g(2)(0) of up to 7 in Hanbury Brown and Twiss measurements. The excitation-density-dependent bunching is quantitatively reproduced by multicolor numerical calculations, suggesting the cascade involving biexciton and phonon-mediated exciton decay as origin of the photon pair. Our findings provide new insights into energy-degenerate photon-pair generation in these highly engineerable quantum-light emitters, marking important steps toward their application in quantum-information technologies.

TI Quantum optimization within lattice gauge theory model on a quantum
   simulator
SO NPJ QUANTUM INFORMATION
AB Simulating lattice gauge theory (LGT) Hamiltonian and its nontrivial states by programmable quantum devices has attracted numerous attention in recent years. Rydberg atom arrays constitute one of the most rapidly developing arenas for quantum simulation and quantum computing. The Z(2) LGT and topological order has been realized in experiments while the U(1) LGT is being worked hard on the way. States of LGT have local constraints and are fragmented into several winding sectors with topological protection. It is therefore difficult to reach the ground state in target sector for experiments, and it is also an important task for quantum topological memory. Here, we propose a protocol of sweeping quantum annealing (SQA) for searching the ground state among topological sectors. With the quantum Monte Carlo method, we show that this SQA has linear time complexity of size with applications to the antiferromagnetic transverse field Ising model, which has emergent U(1) gauge fields. This SQA protocol can be realized easily on quantum simulation platforms such as Rydberg array and D-wave annealer. We expect this approach would provide an efficient recipe for resolving the topological hindrances in quantum optimization and the preparation of quantum topological state.

TI Quantum key distribution with imperfectly isolated devices
SO QUANTUM SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB Most security proofs of quantum key distribution (QKD) assume that there is no unwanted information leakage about the state preparation process. However, this assumption is impossible to guarantee in practice, as QKD systems can leak information to the channel due to device imperfections or the active action of an eavesdropper. Here, we solve this pressing issue by introducing a security proof in the presence of information leakage from all state preparation settings for arguably the most popular QKD scheme, namely the decoy-state BB84 protocol. The proof requires minimal experimental characterization, as only a single parameter related to the isolation of the source needs to be determined, thus providing a clear path for bridging the gap between theory and practice. Moreover, if information about the state of the side channels is available, this can be readily incorporated into the analysis to further improve the resulting performance.

TI Variational quantum algorithm for Gaussian discrete solitons and their
   boson sampling
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB In the context of quantum information, highly nonlinear regimes, such as those supporting solitons, are marginally investigated. We miss general methods for quantum solitons, although they can act as entanglement generators or as self-organized quantum processors. We develop a computational approach that uses a neural network as a variational ansatz for quantum solitons in an array of waveguides. By training the resulting phase space quantum machine-slearning model, we find different soliton solutions, varying the number of particles and interaction strength. We consider Gaussian states that enable measuring the degree of entanglement and sampling the probability distribution of many-particle events. We also determine the probability of generating particle pairs and unveil that soliton bound states emit correlated pairs. These results may have a role in boson sampling with nonlinear systems and in quantum processors for entangled nonlinear waves.

TI Quantum Key Distribution with Displaced Thermal States
SO ENTROPY
AB Secret key exchange relies on the creation of correlated signals, serving as the raw resource for secure communication. Thermal states exhibit Hanbury Brown and Twiss correlations, which offer a promising avenue for generating such signals. In this paper, we present an experimental implementation of a central broadcast thermal-state quantum key distribution (QKD) protocol in the microwave region. Our objective is to showcase a straightforward method of QKD utilizing readily available broadcasting equipment. Unlike conventional approaches to thermal-state QKD, we leverage displaced thermal states. These states enable us to share the output of a thermal source among Alice, Bob, and Eve via both waveguide channels and free space. Through measurement and conversion into bit strings, our protocol produces key-ready bit strings without the need for specialized equipment. By harnessing the inherent noise in thermal broadcasts, our setup facilitates the recovery of distinct bit strings by all parties involved.

TI Phase-matching quantum key distribution with imperfect sources
SO CHINESE PHYSICS B
AB The huge discrepancies between actual devices and theoretical assumptions severely threaten the security of quantum key distribution. Recently, a general new framework called the reference technique has attracted wide attention in defending against the imperfect sources of quantum key distribution. Here, the state preparation flaws, the side channels of mode dependencies, the Trojan horse attacks, and the pulse classical correlations are studied by using the reference technique on the phase-matching protocol. Our simulation results highlight the importance of the actual secure parameters choice for transmitters, which is necessary to achieve secure communication. Increasing the single actual secure parameter will reduce the secure key rate. However, as long as the parameters are set properly, the secure key rate is still high. Considering the influences of multiple actual secure parameters will significantly reduce the secure key rate. These actual secure parameters must be considered when scientists calibrate transmitters. This work is an important step towards the practical and secure implementation of phase-matching protocol. In the future, it is essential to study the main parameters, find out their maximum and general values, classify the multiple parameters as the same parameter, and give countermeasures.

TI Unbounded Device-Independent Quantum Key Rates from Arbitrarily Small
   Nonlocality
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB Device-independent quantum key distribution allows for proving the security of a shared cryptographic key between two distant parties with potentially untrusted devices. The security proof is based on the measurement outcome statistics (correlation) of a Bell experiment, and security is guaranteed by the laws of quantum theory. While it is known that the observed correlation must be Bell nonlocal in order to prove security, recent results show that Bell nonlocality is in general not sufficient for standard deviceindependent quantum key distribution. In this work, we show that conversely, there is no lower bound on the amount of nonlocality that is sufficient for device-independent quantum key distribution. Even more so, we show that from certain correlations that exhibit arbitrarily small nonlocality, one can still extract unbounded device-independent key rates. Therefore, a quantitative relation between device-independent key rates and Bell nonlocality cannot be drawn in general. Our main technique comprises a rigorous connection between self-testing and device-independent quantum key distribution, applied to a recently discovered family of Bell inequalities with arbitrarily many measurement outcomes.

TI Magic states of top quarks
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW D
AB Recent years have seen an increasing body of work examining how quantum entanglement can be measured at high energy particle physics experiments, thereby complementing traditional table-top experiments. This raises the question of whether more concepts from quantum computation can be examined at colliders, and we here consider the property of magic, which distinguishes those quantum states which lead to a genuine computational advantage over classical states when used in algorithms. We examine top-antitop pair production at the LHC, showing that nature chooses to produce magic tops, where the amount of magic varies with the kinematics of the final state. We compare results for individual partonic channels and at proton level, showing that averaging over final states typically increases magic. This is in contrast to entanglement measures, such as the concurrence, which typically decrease. Also, while some entanglement measures (e.g., the concurrence) have a nonzero threshold for entanglement, there is no such nonzero threshold for magic. Our results create new links between the quantum information and particle physics literatures, providing practical insights for further study.

AB A seminal task in quantum information theory is to realize a device able to produce copies of a generic input state with the highest possible output fidelity, thus realizing an optimal quantum cloning machine. Recently, the concept of variational quantum cloning was introduced: a quantum machine learning algorithm through which, by exploiting a classical feedback loop informed by the output of a quantum processing unit, the system can self-learn the programming required for an optimal quantum cloning strategy. In this work, we experimentally implement a 1 -> 2 variational cloning machine of dual-rail encoded photonic qubits, both for phase-covariant and state-dependent cloning. We exploit a fully programmable six-mode universal integrated device and classical feedback to reach near-optimal cloning performances.

TI Distinguish between typical non-Hermitian quantum systems by entropy
   dynamics
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB Non-Hermitian (NH) quantum systems attract research interest increasingly in recent years, among which the PT-symmetric, P-pseudo-Hermitian and their anti-symmetric counterpart systems are focused much more. In this work, we extend the usage of entropy to distinguish time-evolutions of different classes and phases of typical NH-systems. In detail, we investigate the entropy dynamics of two-level NH-systems after quantum decoherence induced by single-qubit projective measurements, finding that it depends on both the initial states and the selection of the computational bases of the measurements. In a general case, we show how to distinguish all the eight phases of the above NH-systems step by step, in which process three different initial states are necessary if the basis of measurement is fixed. We propose how the distinguishing process is realized in quantum simulation, in which quantum tomography is not needed. Our investigations can be applied to judge phase transitions of non-Hermitian systems.

TI Optimization strategies in WAHTOR algorithm for quantum computing
   empirical ansatz: a comparative study
SO ELECTRONIC STRUCTURE
AB By exploiting the invariance of the molecular Hamiltonian by a unitary transformation of the orbitals it is possible to significantly shorter the depth of the variational circuit in the variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) algorithm by using the wavefunction adapted Hamiltonian through orbital rotation (WAHTOR) algorithm. This work introduces a non-adiabatic version of the WAHTOR algorithm and compares its efficiency with three implementations by estimating quantum processing unit (QPU) resources in prototypical benchmarking systems. Calculating first and second-order derivatives of the Hamiltonian at fixed VQE parameters does not introduce a significant QPU overload, leading to results on small molecules that indicate the non-adiabatic Newton-Raphson method as the more convenient choice. On the contrary, we find out that in the case of Hubbard model systems the trust region non-adiabatic optimization is more efficient. The preset work therefore clearly indicates the best optimization strategies for empirical variational ansatzes, facilitating the optimization of larger variational wavefunctions for quantum computing.

TI Decarbonization of Building Operations with Adaptive Quantum
   Computing-Based Model Predictive Control
SO ENGINEERING
AB This work proposes an adaptive quantum approximate optimization-based model predictive control (MPC) strategy for energy management in buildings equipped with battery energy storage and renewable energy generation systems. The learning-based parameter transfer scheme to realize adaptive quantum optimization leverages Bayesian optimization to predict initial quantum circuit parameters. When applied to the MPC problems formulated as quadratic unconstrained binary optimization problems, this approach computes optimal controls to minimize the net energy consumption levels in buildings and promotes decarbonization while reducing the computational efforts required for the quantum approximate optimization algorithm as the building energy system trajectory progresses. The energy efficiency and the decarbonization benefits of the proposed quantum optimization-based MPC strategy are demonstrated on buildings at the Cornell University campus. The proposed quantum computing-based technique to address MPC problems in buildings demonstrates energy-efficient and low-carbon building operation with a 6.8% improvement over deterministic MPC and presents opportunities for scaling to larger control problems with a significant reduction in utilized quantum computing resources. A reduction of 41.2% in carbon emissions is also achieved with the proposed control strategy facilitated by efficiently managing battery energy storage and renewable generation sources to promote a push toward carbonneutral building operations.

TI Quantum Computing for Intelligent Transportation Systems: VQE-Based
   Traffic Routing and EV Charging Scheduling
SO MATHEMATICS
AB Complex optimization problems, such as traffic routing and electric vehicle (EV) charging scheduling, are becoming increasingly challenging for intelligent transportation systems (ITSs), in particular as computational resources are limited and network conditions evolve frequently. This paper explores a quantum computing approach to address these issues by proposing a hybrid quantum-classical (HQC) workflow that leverages the variational quantum eigensolver (VQE), an algorithm particularly well suited for execution on noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) hardware. To this end, the EV charging scheduling and traffic routing problems are both reformulated as binary optimization problems and then encoded into Ising Hamiltonians. Within each VQE iteration, a parametrized quantum circuit (PQC) is prepared and measured on the quantum processor to evaluate the Hamiltonian's expectation value, while a classical optimizer-such as COBYLA, SPSA, Adam, or RMSProp-updates the circuit parameters until convergence. In order to find optimal or nearly optimal solutions, VQE uses PQCs in combination with classical optimization algorithms to iteratively minimize the problem Hamiltonian. Simulation results exhibit that the VQE-based method increases the efficiency of EV charging coordination and improves route selection performance.

TI Self-Adaptive Quantum Kernel Principal Component Analysis for Compact
   Readout of Chemiresistive Sensor Arrays
SO ADVANCED SCIENCE
AB The rapid growth of Internet of Things (IoT) devices necessitates efficient data compression techniques to manage the vast amounts of data they generate. Chemiresistive sensor arrays (CSAs), a simple yet essential component in IoT systems, produce large datasets due to their simultaneous multi-sensor operations. Classical principal component analysis (cPCA), a widely used solution for dimensionality reduction, often struggles to preserve critical information in complex datasets. In this study, the self-adaptive quantum kernel (SAQK) PCA is introduced as a complementary approach to enhance information retention. The results show that SAQK PCA outperforms cPCA in various back end machine-learning tasks, particularly in low-dimensional scenarios where quantum bit resources are constrained. Although the overall improvement is modest in some cases, SAQK PCA proves especially effective in preserving group structures within low-dimensional data. These findings underscore the potential of noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) computers to transform data processing in real-world IoT applications by improving the efficiency and reliability of CSA data compression and readout, despite current qubit limitations.

TI Symmetry-protected topological order as a requirement for
   measurement-based quantum gate teleportation
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB All known resource states for measurement -based quantum teleportation in correlation space possess symmetry -protected topological order, but is this a sufficient or even necessary condition? This work considers two families of one-dimensional qubit states to answer this question in the negative. The first is a family of matrix -product states with bond dimension two that includes the cluster state as a special case, protected by a global non -on -site symmetry, which is characterized by a finite correlation length and a degenerate entanglement spectrum in the thermodynamic limit but which is unable to deterministically teleport a universal set of single-qubit gates. The second are states with bond dimension four that are a resource for deterministic universal teleportation of finite single-qubit gates, but which possess no symmetry.

TI Experimental optimal discrimination of N states of a qubit with fixed
   rates of inconclusive outcomes
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB In a general optimized measurement scheme for discriminating between nonorthogonal quantum states, the error rate is minimized under the constraint of a fixed rate of inconclusive outcomes (FRIO). This so-called optimal FRIO measurement encompasses the standard and well-known minimum-error and optimal unambiguous (or maximum-confidence) discrimination strategies as particular cases. Here, we experimentally demonstrate the optimal FRIO discrimination between N = 2, 3, 5, and 7 equally likely symmetric states of a qubit encoded in photonic path modes. Our implementation consists of applying a probabilistic quantum map which increases the distinguishability between the inputs in a controlled way, followed by a minimum-error measurement on the successfully transformed outputs. The results obtained corroborate this two-step approach and, in our experimental scheme, can be straightforwardly extended to higher dimensions. The optimized measurement demonstrated here will be useful for quantum communication scenarios where the error rate and inconclusive rate must be kept below the levels provided by the respective standard strategies.

TI Teleportation of hybrid entangled states with continuous-variable
   entanglement
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB Hybrid entanglement between discrete-variable (DV) and continuous-variable (CV) quantum systems is an essential resource for heterogeneous quantum networks. Our previous work showed that in lossy channels the teleportation of DV qubits, via CV-entangled states, can be significantly improved by a new protocol defined by a modified Bell state measurement at the sender. This work explores whether a new, similarly modified, CV-based teleportation protocol can lead to improvement in the transfer of hybrid entangled states. To set the scene, we first determine the performance of such a modified protocol in teleporting CV-only qubits, showing that significant improvement over traditional CV-based teleportation is obtained. We then explore similar modifications in the teleportation of a specific hybrid entangled state showing that significant improvement over traditional CV-based teleportation is again found. For a given channel loss, we find teleporting the DV qubit of the hybrid entangled state can always achieve higher fidelity than teleporting the CV qubit. We then explore the use of various non-Gaussian operations in our modified teleportation protocol, finding that, at a cost of lower success probability, quantum scissors provides the most improvement in the loss tolerance. Our new results emphasize that in lossy conditions, the quantum measurements undertaken at the sender can have a surprising and dramatic impact on CV-based teleportation.

TI Between Shor and Steane: A Unifying Construction for Measuring Error
   Syndromes
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB Fault-tolerant quantum error correction requires the measurement of error syndromes in a way that minimizes correlated errors on the quantum data. Steane and Shor ancilla are two well-known methods for fault-tolerant syndrome extraction. In this Letter, we find a unifying construction that generates a family of ancilla blocks that interpolate between Shor and Steane. This family increases the complexity of ancilla construction in exchange for reducing the rounds of measurement required to fault tolerantly measure the error. We then apply this construction to the tonic code of size L x L and find that blocks of size m x m can be used to decode errors in O(L/m) rounds of measurements. Our method can be applied to any Calderbank-Shor-Steane code and presents a new direction for optimizing fault-tolerant quantum computation.

TI Quantum authentication method based on key-controlled maximally mixed
   quantum state encryption
SO EPJ QUANTUM TECHNOLOGY
AB Quantum authentication is a fundamental first step that ensures secure quantum communication. Although various quantum authentication methods have been proposed recently, their implementation efficiency is limited. This paper proposes a key-controlled maximally mixed quantum state encryption (MMQSE) method using only a single qubit, unitary operation, minimized quantum transmissions, and a single qubit measurement, which improves implementation feasibility and operation efficiency. We applied it to representative quantum authentication applications, namely, quantum identity and message authentication. The security of our authentication schemes was verified by analyzing the relationship between the integral ratio of Uhlmann's fidelity and probability of successful eavesdropping. Moreover, we demonstrate the higher authentication efficiency of the proposed scheme in a real quantum-channel noise environment. The upper bound of the valid noise rate was quantified using the integral ratio of Uhlmann's fidelity in a noise environment. Finally, the optimal number of authentication sequences was estimated.

TI Real-time adaptation of quantum noise channel estimates
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Estimates of noise channels for quantum gates are required for most error-mitigation techniques and are desirable for informing quantum error-correction decoders. These estimates can be obtained by resource-intensive offline characterization techniques, but can become stale due to device drift and fluctuations. We propose a method to address this issue by performing real-time adaptation of noise channel estimates during the execution of a quantum algorithmic circuit using extended flag gadgets, midcircuit measurements, and Bayesian inference. We carry out analytical calculations and numerical simulations employing a Dirichlet prior distribution for the error rates in a Pauli channel to demonstrate and evaluate the technique, which can be seen as a protocol for real-time calibration of high-level gate error information.

TI Bright Electrically Controllable Quantum-Dot-Molecule Devices Fabricated
   by In Situ Electron-Beam Lithography
SO ADVANCED QUANTUM TECHNOLOGIES
AB Self-organized semiconductor quantum dots represent almost ideal two-level systems, which have strong potential to applications in photonic quantum technologies. For instance, they can act as emitters in close-to-ideal quantum light sources. Coupled quantum dot systems with significantly increased functionality are potentially of even stronger interest since they can be used to host ultra-stable singlet-triplet spin qubits for efficient spin-photon interfaces and for deterministic photonic 2D cluster-state generation. An advanced quantum dot molecule (QDM) device is realized and excellent optical properties are demonstrated. The device includes electrically controllable QDMs based on stacked quantum dots in a pin-diode structure. The QDMs are deterministically integrated into a photonic structure with a circular Bragg grating using in situ electron beam lithography. A photon extraction efficiency of up to (24 +/- 4)% is measured in good agreement with numerical simulations. The coupling character of the QDMs is clearly demonstrated by bias voltage dependent spectroscopy that also controls the orbital couplings of the QDMs and their charge state in quantitative agreement with theory. The QDM devices show excellent single-photon emission properties with a multi-photon suppression of g(2)(0)=(3.9 +/- 0.5)x10-3. These metrics make the developed QDM devices attractive building blocks for use in future photonic quantum networks using advanced nanophotonic hardware.

In this inaugural issue of eLight, we highlight a few emerging trends in photonics that we think are likely to have major impact at least in the upcoming decade, spanning from integrated quantum photonics and quantum computing, through topological/non-Hermitian photonics and topological insulator lasers, to AI-empowered nanophotonics and photonic machine learning.

TI Advancing X-ray quantum imaging through Monte-Carlo simulations
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB Imaging with X-rays poses fundamental limits due to radiation damage of the highly energetic photons. This becomes problematic for sensitive biological systems such as subcellular structures. Lowering the radiation dose, without sacrificing the signal-to-noise ratio, would be desirable for any kind of imaging modalities involving X-rays. To achieve this goal, quantum imaging with entangled X-ray photons constitutes a promising route. Production of biphotons have been demonstrated in the X-ray regime by the process of Spontaneous Parametric Down-Conversion (SPDC). However, compared to SPDC in the regime of visible light, the production rate for X-ray biphotons is extremely low. With the introduction of new high average brightness X-ray sources, such as 4th generation synchrotrons and high repetition rate Free-Electron X-ray Lasers (XFEL), quantum imaging may become practical. We introduce a ray tracing approach using Monte-Carlo sampling, specifically designed for quantum imaging with entangled X-ray photons generated by SPDC. By simulation, the superior image quality of quantum over classical imaging methods is demonstrated using realistic experimental conditions available at high repetition rate XFELs. With these simulations, we can efficiently assist the design of future experiments at beam lines, which can substantially accelerate the advancement of X-ray quantum imaging and reduce costs.

TI Quaternionic and Octonionic Frameworks for Quantum Computation:
   Mathematical Structures, Models, and Fundamental Limitations
SO QUANTUM REPORTS
AB We develop detailed quaternionic and octonionic frameworks for quantum computation grounded on normed division algebras. Our central result is to prove the polynomial computational equivalence of quaternionic and complex quantum models: Computation over H is polynomially equivalent to the standard complex quantum circuit model and hence captures the same complexity class BQP up to polynomial reductions. Over H, we construct a complete model-quaternionic qubits on right H-modules with quaternion-valued inner products, unitary dynamics, associative tensor products, and universal gate sets-and establish polynomial equivalence with the standard complex model; routes for implementation at fidelities exceeding 99% via pulse-level synthesis on current hardware are discussed. Over O, non-associativity yields path-dependent evolution, ambiguous adjoints/inner products, non-associative tensor products, and possible failure of energy conservation outside associative sectors. We formalize these obstructions and systematize four mitigation strategies: Confinement to associative subalgebras, G2-invariant codes, dynamical decoupling of associator terms, and a seven-factor algebraic decomposition for gate synthesis. The results delineate the feasible quaternionic regime from the constrained octonionic landscape and point to applications in symmetry-protected architectures, algebra-aware simulation, and hypercomplex learning.

TI Quantum Key Distribution for Critical Infrastructures: Towards
   Cyber-Physical Security for Hydropower and Dams
SO SENSORS
AB Hydropower facilities are often remotely monitored or controlled from a centralized remote control room. Additionally, major component manufacturers monitor the performance of installed components, increasingly via public communication infrastructures. While these communications enable efficiencies and increased reliability, they also expand the cyber-attack surface. Communications may use the internet to remote control a facility's control systems, or it may involve sending control commands over a network from a control room to a machine. The content could be encrypted and decrypted using a public key to protect the communicated information. These cryptographic encoding and decoding schemes become vulnerable as more advances are made in computer technologies, such as quantum computing. In contrast, quantum key distribution (QKD) and other quantum cryptographic protocols are not based upon a computational problem, and offer an alternative to symmetric cryptography in some scenarios. Although the underlying mechanism of quantum cryptogrpahic protocols such as QKD ensure that any attempt by an adversary to observe the quantum part of the protocol will result in a detectable signature as an increased error rate, potentially even preventing key generation, it serves as a warning for further investigation. In QKD, when the error rate is low enough and enough photons have been detected, a shared private key can be generated known only to the sender and receiver. We describe how this novel technology and its several modalities could benefit the critical infrastructures of dams or hydropower facilities. The presented discussions may be viewed as a precursor to a quantum cybersecurity roadmap for the identification of relevant threats and mitigation.

TI From counterportation to local wormholes
SO QUANTUM SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB We propose an experimental realisation of the protocol for the counterfactual disembodied transport of an unknown qubit-or what we call counterportation-where sender and receiver, remarkably, exchange no particles. We employ cavity quantum electrodynamics, estimating resources for beating the classical fidelity limit-except, unlike teleportation, no pre-shared entanglement nor classical communication are required. Our approach is multiple orders of magnitude more efficient in terms of physical resources than previously proposed implementation, paving the way for a demonstration using existing imperfect devices. Surprisingly, while such communication is intuitively explained in terms of 'interaction-free' measurement and the Zeno effect, we show that neither is necessary, with far-reaching implications in support of an underlying physical reality. We go on to characterise an explanatory framework for counterportation starting from constructor theory: local wormholes. Conversely, a counterportation experiment demonstrating the traversability of space, by means of what is essentially a two-qubit exchange-free quantum computer, can point to the existence in the lab of such traversable wormholes.

TI Quantum entanglement resource utilization in quantum-classical
   networking
SO OPTICAL SWITCHING AND NETWORKING
AB This work presents a hybrid quantum-classical architecture that converts entanglement-derived resources including ultra-precise timing, private/common randomness and certified entropy into first-class primitives for 5G networks. Semiconductor quantum-dot sources and correlation electronics distribute photon-pair coincidences, while a layered protocol stack exposes the resulting services to 5G core functions. As a proofof-concept, we embed a quantum-random-number generator (QRNG) into the 5G Authentication and Key Agreement (AKA) procedure, replacing the pseudo-random RAND generator in Open5GS with an HTTP-served QRNG feed. A simulation of sequential UE attachments shows that the QRNG path increases cumulative control-plane latency by approximate to 12% and produces isolated Round-Trip-Time (RTT) spikes, yet leaves data-plane efficiency largely unchanged: delivery rate matches the baseline while a flatter pacing profile lowers the risk of queue build-up. These results quantify the performance trade-off of QRNG-enhanced 5G and motivate tighter in-process or hardware QRNG integration in future quantum-enabled mobile networks.

TI Experimental investigation of the relation between measurement
   uncertainties and non-local quantum correlations
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICS COMMUNICATIONS
AB Bell's inequalities are defined by sums of correlations involving non-commuting observables in each of the two systems. Violations of Bell's inequalities are only possible because the precision of any joint measurement of these observables will be limited by quantum mechanical uncertainty relations. In this paper we explore the relation between the local measurement uncertainties and the magnitude of the correlations by preparing polarization entangled photon pairs and performing joint measurements of non-commuting polarization components at different uncertainty trade-offs. The change in measurement visibility reveals the existence of a non-trivial balance between the measurement uncertainties where the probabilities of a specific pair of measurement outcomes approaches zero because of the particular combination of enhancement and suppression of the experimentally observed correlations. The occurrence of these high-contrast results shows that the quantum correlations between the photons are close to their maximal value, confirming that the Cirel'son bound of Bell's inequality violations is defined by the minimal uncertainties that limit the precision of joint measurements.

TI Entanglement harvesting and curvature of entanglement: A modular
   operator approach
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW D
AB An operator-algebraic framework based on Tomita-Takesaki modular theory is used to study aspects of quantum entanglement via the application of the modular conjugation operator J. The entanglement structure of quantum fields is studied through the protocol of entanglement harvesting whereby quantum correlations evolve through the time evolution of qubit detectors coupled to a Bosonic field. Modular conjugation operators are constructed for Unruh-Dewitt type qubits interacting with a scalar field such that initially unentangled qubits become entangled. The entanglement harvested in this process is directly quantified by an expectation value involving J offering a physical application of this operator. The modular operator formalism is then extended to the Markovian open system dynamics of coupled qubits by expressing entanglement monotones as functionals of a state rho and its modular reflection J rho J. The second derivative of such functionals with respect to an external coupling parameter, termed the curvature of entanglement, provides a natural measure of entanglement sensitivity. At points of modular self-duality, the curvature of entanglement coincides with the quantum Fisher information measure. These results demonstrate that the modular conjugation operator J captures both the harvesting of entanglement from quantum fields and the curvature of entanglement in coupled qubit dynamics providing parallel modular structures that connect these systems.

TI A scheme to create and verify scalable entanglement in optical lattice
SO NPJ QUANTUM INFORMATION
AB To achieve scalable quantum information processing, great efforts have been devoted to the creation of large-scale entangled states in various physical systems. Ultracold atom in optical lattice is considered as one of the promising platforms due to its feasible initialization and parallel manipulation. In this work, we propose an efficient scheme to generate and characterize global entanglement in the optical lattice. With only two-layer quantum circuits, the generation utilizes two-qubit entangling gates based on the superexchange interaction in double wells. The parallelism of these operations enables the generation to be fast and scalable. To verify the entanglement of this non-stabilizer state, we mainly design three complementary detection protocols which are less resource-consuming compared to the full tomography. In particular, one just needs two homogenous local measurement settings to identify the entanglement property. Our entanglement generation and verification protocols provide the foundation for the further quantum information processing in optical lattice.

TI Generation of correlated quantum random number sequences with bright
   twin beams
SO APPLIED PHYSICS LETTERS
AB Quantum random number generators play a vital role in securing communication and encryption. In the present work, we have produced bright twin beams using four-wave mixing in a double- Lambda configuration in rubidium-85 vapor and generated two strings of highly correlated random numbers. The randomness originates from the probabilistic nature of the intensity fluctuations of the twin beams and the quantum correlations are certified by measuring the intensity-difference squeezing in the generated twin beams. At an analysis frequency of 2 MHz, we have measured 95% correlation between the random intensity fluctuations of the twin beams. We observe over 5 bits/sample of entropy from the quantum fluctuations of the twin beams. Furthermore, to extract identical strings of random numbers, post-selection of the binned data and hashing algorithms are used, leading to a binary string of random numbers at a rate of 6 Mbps that passes standard statistical tests from NIST and TestU01. Here, the simplicity of generating bright twin beams shows the potential of this method in quantum cryptography and quantum communication.

TI Quantum Algorithm for Numerical Energy Gradient Calculations at the Full

AB A Bayesian phase difference estimation (BPDE) algorithm allows us to compute the energy gap of two electronic states of a given Hamiltonian directly by utilizing the quantum superposition of their wave functions. Here we report an extension of the BPDE algorithm to the direct calculation of the energy difference of two molecular geometries. We apply the BPDE algorithm for the calculation of numerical energy gradients based on the two-point finite-difference method, enabling us to execute geometry optimization of one-dimensional molecules at the full-CI level on a quantum computer. Results of numerical quantum circuit simulations of the geometry optimization of the H-2 molecule with the STO-3G and 6-31G basis sets, the LiH and BeH2 molecules at the full-CI/STO-3G level, and the N-2 molecule at the CASCI(6e,6o)/6-311G* level are given.

TI Analytic Design of Accelerated Adiabatic Gates in Realistic Qubits:
   General Theory and Applications to Superconducting Circuits
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB Shortcuts to adiabaticity is a general method for speeding up adiabatic quantum protocols, and has many potential applications in quantum information processing. Unfortunately, analytically constructing shortcuts to adiabaticity for systems having complex interactions and more than a few levels is a challenging task. This is usually overcome by assuming an idealized Hamiltonian [e.g., only a limited subset of energy levels are retained, and the rotating-wave approximation (RWA) is made]. Here we develop an analytic approach that allows one to go beyond these limitations. Our method is general and results in analytically derived pulse shapes that correct both nonadiabatic errors and non-RWA errors. We also show that our approach can yield pulses requiring a smaller driving power than conventional nonadiabatic protocols. We show in detail how our ideas can be used to analytically design high-fidelity single-qubit "tripod" gates in a realistic superconducting fluxonium qubit.

TI Device-Independent Quantum Key Activation
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB Device-independent quantum key distribution (DIQKD) allows two distant parties to establish a secret key, based only on the observed Bell nonlocal distribution. It remains unclear, however, what the minimal resources for enabling DIQKD are and how to maximize the key rate from a given distribution. In the present Letter, we consider a scenario where several copies of a given quantum distribution are jointly processed via a local and classical wiring operation. We find that, under few assumptions, it is possible to activate device-independent key, that is, starting from a distribution that is useless in a DIQKD protocol, we obtain a positive asymptotic key rate by wiring several copies together. We coin this effect deviceindependent key activation. Our analysis focuses on the standard DIQKD protocol with one-way postprocessing, and we resort to semidefinite programming techniques for computing lower bounds on the key rate.

TI Exact quantification of bipartite entanglement in unresolvable spin
   ensembles
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Quantifying mixed-state entanglement in many-body systems has been a formidable task. In this work, we quantify the entanglement of states in unresolvable spin ensembles, which are inherently mixed. By exploiting their permutationally invariant properties, we show that the bipartite entanglement of a wide range of unresolvable ensemble states can be calculated exactly. Our formalism is versatile; it can be used to evaluate the entanglement in an ensemble with an arbitrary number of particles, effective angular momentum, and bipartition. We apply our method to explore the characteristics of entanglement in different physically motivated scenarios, including states with definite magnetization and metrologically useful superpositions such as Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) states and spin-squeezed states. Our method can help understand the role of entanglement in spin-ensemble-based quantum technologies.

TI Quantum sensing with spin defects in boron nitride nanotubes
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Spin defects in semiconductors are widely investigated for various applications in quantum sensing. Conventional host materials such as diamond and hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) provide bulk or low-dimensional platforms for optically addressable spin systems, but often lack the structural properties needed for chemical sensing. Here, we introduce a new class of quantum sensors based on naturally occurring spin defects in boron nitride nanotubes (BNNTs), which combine high surface area with omnidirectional spin control, key features for enhanced sensing performance. First, we present strong evidence that these defects consist of weakly-coupled spin pairs, akin to recently identified centers in hBN, and demonstrate coherent spin control over ensembles embedded within randomly oriented, dense, BNNTs networks. Using dynamical decoupling, we enhance spin coherence times by a factor exceeding 300 times and implement high-resolution detection of radiofrequency signals. By integrating the BNNT mesh sensor into a microfluidic platform we demonstrate chemical sensing of paramagnetic ions in solution, with detectable concentrations reaching levels nearly 1000 times lower than previously demonstrated using comparable hBN-based systems. This highly porous and flexible architecture positions BNNTs as a powerful new host material for quantum sensing.

SO THEORETICAL COMPUTER SCIENCE
AB Lexicographically minimal string rotation is a fundamental problem in string processing that has recently garnered significant attention in quantum computing. Near-optimal quantum algorithms have been proposed for solving this problem, utilizing a divide-and-conquer structure. In this note, we show that its quantum query complexity is root root n center dot 2n( logn), improving the prior result of root n center dot 2(logn)1/2+epsilon by Akmal and Jin (2022). Notably, this improvement is quasi-polylogarithmic, which is achieved by only logarithmic level-wise optimization using fault-tolerant quantum minimum finding.

TI Versatile quantum-safe hybrid key exchange and its application to MACsec
SO EPJ QUANTUM TECHNOLOGY
AB Advancements in quantum computing pose a significant threat to most of the cryptography currently deployed in our communication networks. Fortunately, cryptographic building blocks to mitigate this threat are already available; mostly based on Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC) and Quantum Key Distribution (QKD), but also on symmetric cryptography techniques. Notably, those building blocks must be deployed as soon as possible in communication networks due to the "harvest-now decrypt-later" attack scenario, which is already challenging our sensitive and encrypted data today.Following an agile and defense-in-depth approach, Hybrid Authenticated Key-Exchange (HAKE) protocols have recently been gaining significant attention. Such protocols have the benefit of modularly combining classical (symmetric) cryptography, PQC, and QKD to achieve strong confidentiality, authenticity, and integrity guarantees for network channels. Unfortunately, only a few protocols have yet been proposed (mainly Muckle and Muckle+) with different flexibility guarantees.Looking at available standards in the network domain - especially at the Media Access Control Security (MACsec) standard - we believe that HAKE protocols could already bring strong security benefits to MACsec today. MACsec is a standard designed to secure communication at the data link layer in Ethernet networks by providing confidentiality, authenticity, and integrity for all traffic between trusted nodes. In addition, it establishes secure channels within a Local Area Network (LAN), ensuring that data remain protected from eavesdropping, tampering, and unauthorized access, while operating transparently to higher layer protocols. Currently, MACsec does not offer enough protection against the aforementioned threats.In this work, we tackle the challenge and propose a new versatile HAKE protocol, dubbed VMuckle, which is sufficiently flexible for use in MACsec. The use of VMuckle in MACsec provides LAN participants with quantum-safe hybrid key material to ensure secure communication even in the event of cryptographically relevant quantum computers.

TI Efficient quantum circuit compilation for near-term quantum advantage
SO EPJ QUANTUM TECHNOLOGY
AB Quantum noise in real-world devices poses a significant challenge in achieving practical quantum advantage, since accurately compiled and executed circuits are typically deep and highly susceptible to decoherence. To facilitate the implementation of complex quantum algorithms on noisy hardware, we propose an approximate method for compiling target quantum circuits into brick-wall layouts. This new circuit design consists of two-qubit CNOT gates that can be directly implemented on real quantum computers, in conjunction with optimized one-qubit gates, to approximate the essential dynamics of the original circuit while significantly reducing its depth. Our approach is evaluated through numerical simulations of time-evolution circuits for the critical Ising model, quantum Fourier transformation, and Haar-random quantum circuits, as well as experiments on IBM quantum platforms. By accounting for compilation error and circuit noise, we demonstrate that time evolution and quantum Fourier transformation circuits achieve high compression rates, while random quantum circuits are less compressible. The degree of compression is related to the rate of entanglement accumulation in the target circuit. In particular, experiments on IBM platforms achieve a compression rate of 12.5 for N=12\documentclass[12pt]{minimal} \usepackage{amsmath} \usepackage{wasysym} \usepackage{amsfonts} \usepackage{amssymb} \usepackage{amsbsy} \usepackage{mathrsfs} \usepackage{upgreek} \setlength{\oddsidemargin}{-69pt} \begin{document}$N=12$\end{document}, significantly extending the application of current quantum devices.

TI TSV-integrated surface electrode ion trap for scalable quantum
   information processing
SO APPLIED PHYSICS LETTERS
AB In this study, we report about the design, fabrication, and operation of a Cu-filled through-silicon via (TSV)-integrated ion trap. TSVs are placed directly underneath electrodes as vertical interconnections between an ion trap and a glass interposer, facilitating the arbitrary geometry design with increasing electrode numbers and evolving complexity. The integration of TSVs reduces the form factor of the ion trap by more than 80%, minimizing parasitic capacitance from 32 +/- 2 to 3 +/- 0.2pF. A low RF dissipation is achieved in spite of the absence of the ground screening layer. The entire fabrication process is on a 12-in. wafer and compatible with the established CMOS back end process. We demonstrate the basic functionality of the trap by loading and laser-cooling single Sr-88(+) ions. It is found that both the heating rate (17 quanta/ms for an axial frequency of 300kHz) and lifetime (similar to 30min) are comparable with traps of similar dimensions. This work pioneers the development of TSV-integrated ion traps, enriching the toolbox for scalable quantum computing.

TI Re-examination of important defect complexes in silicon: From
   microelectronics to quantum computing
SO JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYSICS
AB The physical properties of silicon can be controlled by defects and impurities present in the lattice, with carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen being the most important impurities. During material processing, these impurities interact with each other leading to the formation of clusters. The T-center contains two inequivalent C atoms with one of the two linked to an H interstitial atom. The I-center contains at least one C, one H, and one O atom in its structure. The M-center contains at least two C atoms and an H atom, but its exact structure has not been definitely determined. The G-center contains a C substitutional and C interstitial pair, whereas the W-center is composed of three silicon self-interstitials. Here, we re-examine the structure and the electronic properties of carbon-hydrogen and carbon-hydrogen-oxygen defects (T, M, I, G, and W-centers) as these are presently important for emerging quantum technologies. We discuss experimental work and how recent theoretical calculations have furthered our knowledge of these important centers. (c) 2025 Author(s).

TI Demonstration of Entanglement-Enhanced Covert Sensing
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB The laws of quantum physics endow superior performance and security for information processing: quantum sensing harnesses nonclassical resources to enable measurement precision unmatched by classical sensing, whereas quantum cryptography aims to unconditionally protect the secrecy of the processed information. Here, we present the theory and experiment for entanglement-enhanced covert sensing, a paradigm that simultaneously offers high measurement precision and data integrity by concealing the probe signal in an ambient noise background so that the execution of the protocol is undetectable with a high probability. We show that entanglement offers a performance boost in estimating the imparted phase by a probed object, as compared to a classical protocol at the same covertness level. The implemented entanglement-enhanced covert sensing protocol operates close to the fundamental quantum limit by virtue of its near-optimum entanglement source and quantum receiver. Our work is expected to create ample opportunities for quantum information processing at unprecedented security and performance levels.

TI The surprising persistence of time-dependent quantum entanglement
SO NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB The mismatch between elegant theoretical models and the detailed experimental reality is particularly pronounced in quantum nonlinear interferometry (QNI). In stark contrast to theory, experiments contain pump beams that start in impure states and that are depleted, quantum noise that affects-and drives-any otherwise gradual build up of the signal and idler fields, and nonlinear materials that are far from ideal and have a complicated time-dependent dispersive response. Notably, we would normally expect group velocity mismatches to destroy any possibility of measurable or visible entanglement, even though it remains intact-the mismatches change the relative timings of induced signal-idler entanglements, thus generating 'which path' information. Using an approach based on the positive-P representation, which is ideally suited to such problems, we are able to keep detailed track of the time-domain entanglement crucial for QNI. This allows us to show that entanglement can be-and is-recoverable despite the obscuring effects of real-world complications; and that recovery is attributable to an implicit time-averaging present in the detection process.

While most conventional QEM schemes assume discrete gate-based circuits with noise appearing either before or after each gate, the assumptions are inappropriate for describing realistic noise that may have strong gate dependence and complicated nonlocal effects, and general computing models such as analog quantum simulators. To address these challenges, we first extend the scenario, where each computation process, being either digital or analog, is described by a continuous time evolution. For noise from imperfections of the engineered Hamiltonian or additional noise operators, we show it can be effectively suppressed by a stochastic QEM method. Since our method assumes only accurate single qubit controls, it is applicable to all digital quantum computers and various analog simulators. Meanwhile, errors in the mitigation procedure can be suppressed by leveraging the Richardson extrapolation method. As we numerically test our method with various Hamiltonians under energy relaxation and dephasing noise and digital quantum circuits with additional two-qubit crosstalk, we show an improvement of simulation accuracy by 2 orders. We assess the resource cost of our scheme and conclude the feasibility of accurate quantum computing with NISQ devices.

TI Quantum variational solving of the Wheeler-DeWitt equation
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW D
AB One of the central difficulties in the quantization of the gravitational interactions is that they are described by a set of constraints. The standard strategy for dealing with the problem is the Dirac quantization procedure, which leads to the Wheeler-DeWitt equation. However, solutions to the equation are known only for specific symmetry-reduced systems, including models of quantum cosmology. Novel methods, which enable solving the equation for complex gravitational configurations, are therefore worth seeking. Here, we propose and investigate a new method of solving the Wheeler-DeWitt equation for minisuperspace models (with a finite number of classical degrees of freedom). The approach employs variational quantum algorithms and is possible to implement on quantum computers. For this purpose, the gravitational system is regularized, by performing spherical compactification of the phase space. This makes the system's Hilbert space finite dimensional and allows to use SU(2) variables, which are easy to handle in quantum computing. The validity of the method is examined in the case of the flat de Sitter universe. Both an emulator of a quantum computer and the IBM superconducting quantum computer have been used. The advantages and limitations of the approach are discussed.

TI Qubit Clock in Quantum Cosmology
SO UNIVERSE
AB We investigate the emergent time scenario in quantum cosmology based on the Page-Wotters approach. Using a quantum cosmological model with a qubit clock, it is demonstrated how the entanglement between the qubit clock and the geometry derives emergence of a time parameter, which defines evolution of the timeless quantum state of the universe. We show that the universe wave function conditioned by a qubit clock obeys the standard Schrodinger equation and the Fisher information for the clock state, which quantifies entanglement between the universe and the clock, and contributes as a negative energy density.

TI Navigating quantum security risks in networked environments: A
   comprehensive study of quantum-safe network protocols
SO COMPUTERS & SECURITY
AB The emergence of quantum computing poses a formidable security challenge to network protocols traditionally safeguarded by classical cryptographic algorithms. This paper provides an exhaustive analysis of vulnerabilities introduced by quantum computing in a diverse array of widely utilized security protocols across the layers of the TCP/IP model, including TLS, IPsec, SSH, PGP, and more. Our investigation focuses on precisely identifying vulnerabilities susceptible to exploitation by quantum adversaries at various migration stages for each protocol while also assessing the associated risks and consequences for secure communication. We delve deep into the impact of quantum computing on each protocol, emphasizing potential threats posed by quantum attacks and scrutinizing the effectiveness of post-quantum cryptographic solutions. Through carefully evaluating vulnerabilities and risks that network protocols face in the post-quantum era, this study provides invaluable insights to guide the development of appropriate countermeasures. Our findings contribute to a broader comprehension of quantum computing's influence on network security and offer practical guidance for protocol designers, implementers, and policymakers in addressing the challenges stemming from the advancement of quantum computing. This comprehensive study is a crucial step towards fortifying the security of networked environments in the quantum age.

TI FEqa: Finite element computations on quantum annealers
SO COMPUTER METHODS IN APPLIED MECHANICS AND ENGINEERING
AB The solution of physical problems discretized using the finite element methods using NISQ quantum hardware remains relatively unexplored. Here, we present a unified formulation (FEqa) to solve such problems using quantum annealers. FEqa is a hybrid technique in which the finite element problem is formulated on a classical computer, and the residual is minimized using a quantum annealer. The advantages of FEqa include utilizing a single qubit per degree of freedom, enforcing Dirichlet boundary conditions a priori, reaching arbitrary solution precision, and eliminating the possibility of the annealer generating invalid results. FEqa is scalable on the classical portion of the algorithm due to its Single Program Multiple Data (SPMD) nature and does not rely on ground state solutions from the annealer. The exponentially large number of collocation points used in quantum annealing are investigated for their cosine measures, and new iterative techniques are developed to exploit their properties. The quantum annealer has clear advantages in computational time over simulated annealing, for the example problems presented in this paper solved on the D-Wave machine. The presented work provides a pathway to solving physical problems using quantum annealers. (C) 2022 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Efficient quantum algorithms for set operations
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB Analyzing the relations between Boolean functions has many applications in many fields, such as database systems, cryptography, and collision problems. This paper proposes four quantum algorithms that use amplitude amplification techniques to perform set operations, including Intersection, Difference, and Union, on two Boolean functions in O ( N ) \documentclass[12pt]{minimal} \usepackage{amsmath} \usepackage{wasysym} \usepackage{amsfonts} \usepackage{amssymb} \usepackage{amsbsy} \usepackage{mathrsfs} \usepackage{upgreek} \setlength{\oddsidemargin}{-69pt} \begin{document}$$\mathcal {O}(\sqrt{\mathcal {N}} )$$\end{document} time complexity. The proposed algorithms employ two quantum amplitude amplification techniques divided into two stages. The first stage uses the Younes et al. algorithm for quantum searching via entanglement and partial diffusion to prepare incomplete superpositions of the truth set of the first Boolean function. In the second stage, a modified version of Arima's algorithm, along with an oracle that represent the second Boolean function, is employed to handle the set operations. The proposed algorithms have a higher probability of success in more general and comprehensive applications when compared with relevant techniques in literature.

TI Fermionic Hamiltonians without trivial low-energy states
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB One of the main problems in computational physics is predicting the low-energy behavior of many-body quantum systems. The computational complexity of this problem, however, is relatively poorly understood. A recent major progress in this direction has been the no low-energy trivial states (NLTS) theorem; it gives a family of qubit Hamiltonians whose low-energy states cannot be reached by shallow quantum circuits. In this work we provide a fermionic counterpart to this theorem, constructing local fermionic Hamiltonians with no low-energy trivial states. Distinct from the qubit case, we define trivial states via finite-depth fermionic quantum circuits. We further strengthen the result, allowing free access to (generally, deep) Gaussian fermionic circuits into our notion of a trivial state. The desired fermionic Hamiltonian can be constructed using any qubit Hamiltonian which has the NLTS property via well-spread distributions over bitstrings. We also define a fermionic analog of quantum probabilistically checkable proofs (PCPs) and explore the relation of fermionic PCP class with the qubit version.

TI New Circuits for Simultaneously Initiating Two Different Quantum
   Superpositions
SO INFORMATION
AB This article presents, for the first time, a new approach to building quantum circuits for the initialization of two multi-qubit superpositions, namely, two different superpositions in one circuit, not in two separate circuits. For this, we introduce the concept of the discrete two signal-induced heap transformation (D2siHT). This transformation is generated by two signals, or vectors, which we call generators. The quantum analogue of the D2siHT is described. It allows us to build a quantum circuit to transform two superpositions |x and |y into the first conventual basis states |000 & mldr;0 and |010 & mldr;0, respectively. Therefore, we can build a single quantum circuit to initiate two multi-qubit superpositions |x and |y from the basis states |000 & mldr;0 and |010 & mldr;0, respectively. Examples with quantum circuits for the preparation and transformation of two 2- and 3-qubit superpositions are described in detail. The results of circuit simulation using Qiskit are also presented. The main characteristic of the D2siHT is its path of processing the data of two generators and input qubits. We consider different paths to effectively compute the D2siHT. Such paths can reduce, for instance, the depth of the resulting quantum circuits, which can lead to a reduction in execution times and susceptibility to decoherence and noise. Multi-qubit superpositions are considered with real amplitudes, but the presented approach can be extended to initiate two such superpositions with complex amplitudes, as well.

TI Investigating Raman backscattering decay and the perspective of
   time-multiplexed quantum communications
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB We have studied the temporal dynamics of Raman scattering caused by classical power in optical fiber and its impact on counter-propagating quantum signals. We investigated, on the entire telecom bands, the duration during which the quantum channel cannot be used in a time-division multiplexing context. Thereby, we estimated performance in terms of secure key rates within the framework of time-division multiplexing. By applying our model to the discrete variable quantum key distribution (DV-QKD) protocol BB84 in different optical communication contexts, we demonstrate the feasibility of counter-propagating time-multiplexing classical and quantum communications. Our results highlight a better preservation of the maximum communication distance for quantum channels compared to other multiplexing schemes.

TI Quantum gradient evaluation through quantum non-demolition measurements
SO EUROPEAN PHYSICAL JOURNAL D
AB We discuss a quantum non-demolition measurement (QNDM) protocol to estimate the derivatives of a cost function with a quantum computer. The cost function, which is supposed to be classically hard to evaluate, is associated with the average value of a quantum operator. Then a quantum computer is used to efficiently extract information about the function and its derivative by evolving the system with a so-called variational quantum circuit. To this aim, we propose to use a quantum detector that allows us to directly estimate the derivatives of an observable, i.e., the derivative of the cost function. With respect to the standard direct measurement approach, this leads to a reduction of the number of circuit iterations needed to run the variational quantum circuits. The advantage increases if we want to estimate the higher-order derivatives. We also show that the presented approach can lead to a further advantage in terms of the number of total logical gates needed to run the variational quantum circuits. These results make the QNDM a valuable alternative to implementing the variational quantum circuits.

TI Dual-Frequency Quantum Phase Estimation Mitigates the Spectral Leakage
   of Quantum Algorithms
SO IEEE SIGNAL PROCESSING LETTERS
AB Quantum phase estimation is an important component in diverse quantum algorithms. However, it suffers from spectral leakage, when the reciprocal of the record length is not an integer multiple of the unknown phase, which incurs an accuracy degradation. For the existing single-sample estimation scheme, window-based methods have been proposed for spectral leakage mitigation. As a further advance, we propose a dual-frequency estimator, which asymptotically approaches the Cramer-Rao bound, when multiple samples are available. Numerical results show that the proposed estimator outperforms the existing window-based methods, when the number of samples is sufficiently high.

TI Quantum multirow iteration algorithm for linear systems with nonsquare
   coefficient matrices
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB In the field of quantum linear system algorithms, quantum computing has realized exponential computational advantages over classical computing. However, the focus has been on square coefficient matrices, with few quantum algorithms addressing nonsquare matrices. Towards this kind of problems defined by Ax = b where A E Rm`n, we propose a quantum algorithm inspired by the classical multirow iteration method and provide an explicit quantum circuit based on the quantum comparator and quantum random access memory. The time complexity of our quantum multirow iteration algorithm is O(K log2 m), with K representing the number of iteration steps, which demonstrates an exponential speedup compared to the classical version.. Based on the convergence of the classical multirow iteration algorithm, we prove that our quantum algorithm converges faster than the quantum one-row iteration algorithm presented by Shao and Xiang [C. Shao and H. Xiang, Phys. Rev. A 101, 022322 (2020)]. Moreover, our algorithm places less demand on the coefficient matrix, making it suitable for solving inconsistent systems and quadratic optimization problems.

AB Sophisticated positive-operator-valued measures (POVMs) are fundamental to obtain a quantum advantage in many informational problems but are difficult to implement. We design a universal measurement device composed of cascaded quantum-walk modules able to realize arbitrary entangled POVMs on two qubits. Only parameters in the modules need reprogramming for different POVMs. We apply our device to the task of direction guessing, realizing nine different five-outcome entangled measurements (fidelities above 0.9850) via nine-step photonic quantum walks, recovering optimal direction guessing from nonideal input states. Our work marks an important step toward building a universal versatile quantum measurement device able to implement optimal measurements for various quantum information tasks.

TI Experimental research on disturbance resistant polarization modulation
   mode for quantum key distribution
SO ACTA PHYSICA SINICA
AB A free-space quantum key distribution (QKD) system based on mobile equipment can provide an effective method to construct a real-time full-coverage multi-node network. However, the existing free-space QKD systems based on mobile devices encounter the challenge regarding the lack of stability caused by equipment disturbance. The robustness of the QKD polarization encoder against mobile device disturbance will be significant. Owing to the inevitable disturbance in practical applications, even the polarization-maintaining fiber (PMF) cannot maintain its polarization-maintaining characteristics well, which in turn affects the stability of some systems based on PMF. Therefore, in order to ensure that stable coding can be achieved under disturbances, we propose a two-way differential modulation mode, in which stable coding can still be achieved even under disturbances. At the same time, in order to verify the actual anti-disturbance characteristics of the mode, the polarization-modulated unit (PMU) with a two-way differential modulation mode is used in this study to generate four long-term stable polarization states subjected to the disturbances with a frequency of 200 Hz. At the same time, the PMU has a higher insertion loss, which makes the influence of crosstalk on the system more obvious. We also discuss two ways i.e. the time domain and frequency domain, to reduce the crosstalk which is caused by the imperfection of the device. The experiment is performed at a repetition frequency of 250 MHz, and a commercial avalanche single-photon detector is used to detect the system's quantum bit error rate (QBER). Under the condition of no disturbance, the average QBER is 0.39% in 2 h. Then a vibration of approximately 200 Hz is used to simulate the practical disturbances, the average QBER is 0.36% in 2 h, and the fluctuation range of the QBER is only within 0.2%. We propose the first feasible encoding scheme in disturbed environments to ensure the long-term stability of the encoded polarization states, which is expected to be used in the multi-node expansion of the quantum network.

   Controlled-Phase-Flip Gate
SO FRONTIERS IN PHYSICS
AB Encoding computing qubits in multiple degrees of freedom (DOFs) of a photonic system allows hyperparallel quantum computation to enlarge channel capacity with less quantum resource, and constructing high-fidelity hyperparallel quantum gates is always recognized as a fundamental prerequisite for hyperparallel quantum computation. Herein, we propose an approach for implementing a high-fidelity photonic hyperparallel controlled-phase-flip (CPF) gate working with polarization, spatial-mode, and frequency DOFs, through utilizing the practical interaction between the single photon and the diamond nitrogen vacancy (NV) center embedded in the cavity. Particularly, the desired output state of the gate without computation errors coming from the practical interaction is obtained, and the robust fidelity is guaranteed in the nearly realistic condition. Meanwhile, the requirement for the experimental realization of the gate is relaxed. In addition, this approach can be generalized to complete the high-fidelity photonic three-DOF hyperparallel CPFN gate and parity-check gate. These interesting features may make the present scheme have potential for applications in the hyperparallel quantum computation.

TI Hybrid Encoder for Discrete and Continuous Variable QKD
SO ADVANCED QUANTUM TECHNOLOGIES
AB Quantum key distribution (QKD) is emerging as a cutting-edge application of quantum technology, gradually integrating into the industrial landscape. Many protocols employing discrete or continuous variables have been developed over time. Whereas the firsts usually excel in covering longer distances, the seconds are typically superior in producing higher secret key rates at short distances. Present efforts aim to create systems that can exploit both these strengths, foreseeing the future challenge regarding the realization of a quantum network consisting of multiple and heterogeneous interconnected nodes. Within such a context, a possible solution is systems able to efficiently toggle between discrete and continuous variable working modes with hybrid quantum state encoders. Therefore, this study presents a new hybrid encoder based on an iPOGNAC modulator, ensuring compatibility with Discrete-Variable (DV) and Continuous-Variable (CV) QKD systems that can be assembled entirely with commercial-off-the-shelf components. The proposed scheme is the first supporting DV polarization protocols, thus making it an appealing candidate for space nodes of a future quantum network, given that polarization-based protocols are well suited for space links.

TI Optimal allocation of quantum resources
SO QUANTUM
AB The optimal allocation of resources is a crucial task for their efficient use in a wide range of practical applications in science and engineering. This paper investigates the optimal allocation of resources in multipartite quantum systems. In particular, we show the relevance of proportional fairness and optimal reliability criteria for the application of quantum resources. Moreover, we present optimal allocation solutions for an arbitrary number of qudits using measurement incompatibility as an exemplary resource theory. Besides, we study the criterion of optimal equitability and demonstrate its relevance to scenarios involving several resource theories such as nonlocality vs local contextuality. Finally, we highlight the potential impact of our results for quantum networks and other multi-party quantum information processing, in particular to the future Quantum Internet.

TI Effect of noisy channels on the transmission of mesoscopic twin-beam
   states
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB Quantum properties of light, which are crucial resources for quantum technologies, are quite fragile in nature and can be degraded and even concealed by the environment. We show, both theoretically and experimentally, that mesoscopic twin-beam states of light can preserve their nonclassicality even in the presence of major losses and different types of noise, thus suggesting their potential usefulness to encode information in quantum communication protocols. We develop a comprehensive general analytical model for a measurable nonclassicality criterion and find thresholds on noise and losses for the survival of entanglement in the twin beam.

TI Probing the curvature of the cosmos from quantum entanglement due to
   gravity
SO PHYSICS LETTERS B
AB If gravity is fundamentally quantum, any two quantum particles must get entangled with each other due to their mutual interaction through gravity. This phenomenon, dubbed gravity-mediated entanglement, has led to recent efforts of detecting perturbative quantum gravity in table-top experimental setups. In this paper, we generalize this to imagine two idealized massive oscillators, in their ground state, which get entangled due to gravity in an expanding universe, and find that the curvature of the background spacetime leaves its imprints on the resulting entanglement profile. Thus, detecting gravity-mediated entanglement from cosmological observations will open up an exciting new avenue of measuring the local expansion rate of the cosmos.

TI Extracting perfect GHZ states from imperfect weighted graph states via
   entanglement concentration
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Photonic Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) states serve as the central resource for a number of important applications in quantum information science, including secret sharing, sensing, and fusion-based quantum computing. The use of photon-emitter entangling gates is a promising approach to creating these states that sidesteps many of the difficulties associated with intrinsically probabilistic methods based on linear optics. However, the efficient creation of high-fidelity GHZ states of many photons remains an outstanding challenge due to both coherent and incoherent errors during the generation process. Here, we propose an entanglement concentration protocol that is capable of generating perfect GHZ states using only local gates and measurements on imperfect weighted graph states. We show that our protocol is both efficient and robust to incoherent noise errors.

TI Topological nonmediocre nodes on two-leg superconducting quantum
   circuits
SO ACTA PHYSICA SINICA
AB Topological gapless systems, as the connection of the different topological quantum phases, have received much attention. Topological nonmediocre nodes are typically observed in two-or three-dimensional gapless systems. In this paper, we demonstrate that the topological nonmediocre nodes are existent in a model that lies between one dimension and two dimensions. Superconducting circuits, as essential all-solid state quantum devices, have offered a promising platform for studying the macro-controlling quantum effects. Recently, experimental achievements have enabled the realization of tunable coupling strengths between transmon qubits and the implementation of a one-dimensional Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) model [Li X et al. 2018 Phys. Rev. Appl. 10 054009]. According to this work, herein we present a two-leg SSH model implemented in superconducting circuits and demonstrate the existence of topological nonmediocre nodes. Firstly, two-leg superconducting circuit with transmon qubits which are coupled with their nearest-neighbor sites by capacitors is designed. To construct the two-leg SSH model, we introduce two alternating-current magnetic fluxes to drive each transmon qubit. We discover two types of phase boundaries in the SSH model and obtain the corresponding energy spectra and phase diagram. We identify two distinct topological insulating phases characterized by winding number & PLUSMN;1, and the corresponding edge states exhibit distinct characteristics. Moreover, we discuss the topological properties of the two phase boundaries. By representing the Bloch states as a vector field in k space, we demonstrate the existence of two kinks of nonmediocre nodes with first-type phase boundaries. These two nonmediocrenodes possess distinct topological charges of 1 and -1, respectively. On the other hand, the nonmediocre nodes with the second-type phase boundaries are topologically trivial. These results open the way for exploring novel topological states, ladder physical systems, and nodal point topological semimetals.

AB Micro Electromechanical Systems (MEMS) switches offer many advantages over conventional larger switches. One potential application we are exploring is the use of commercial radio frequency (RF) MEMS switches for quantum computing applications. However, it is well-documented that cryogenic temperatures can cause mechanical reliability issues for MEMS. Furthermore, commercial RF MEMS switches are designed for room temperature operation, thus their reliability at cryogenic temperatures is unknown. Commercial MEMS switches are also packaged inside sealed housings, which prevent the use of optical methods for characterization and inspection. We are therefore developing test methods to evaluate the reliability of commercial RF MEMS switches at cryogenic temperatures. We describe our test methods and preliminary reliability test data from room temperature down to 55 K.

AB Quantum resources lie at the core of quantum computation as they are responsible for the computational advantage in many tasks. The complementary relations are a pathway to understanding how the physical quantities are related. This work presents a complementary relationship between the quantumness of a two qubits state and the degree of entanglement, respectively measured by roughness and concurrence. There is a finite R2 region that can be used to characterize the two qubits subspace. Heat maps for accumulation points over the surfaces of pure and non-pure randomly sampled states are presented, also an investigation of a decoherence process using a bath under zero and non-zero temperature is performed using the roughness versus concurrence parameter space.(c) 2022 Elsevier B.V.

TI On solving for shocks and travelling waves using a quantum algorithm
SO COMPUTERS & FLUIDS
AB In this paper, we solve for shocks and travelling waves in advection, inviscid Burgers' and Burgers' equations by implementing a recently established quantum algorithm in the literature. The quantum algorithm has been successful in solving Navier-Stokes, flow generated by Burgers' and submarine tephra flow equations under certain initial and boundary conditions. Here, we further study the efficacy of the quantum algorithm by extending the application to advection, inviscid Burgers' and Burgers' equations under different kinds of initial and boundary conditions. In addition to central differencing and upwinding, Lax-Wendroff discretization scheme has also been introduced in the quantum algorithm to observe how numerical dissipation and dispersion are affected. We recover known travelling waves, and shocks with rarefaction and expansion.

TI Quantum information diode based on a magnonic crystal
SO MATERIALS FOR QUANTUM TECHNOLOGY
AB Exploiting the effect of nonreciprocal magnons in a system with no inversion symmetry, we propose a concept of a quantum information diode (QID), i.e. a device rectifying the amount of quantum information transmitted in the opposite directions. We control the asymmetric left and right quantum information currents through an applied external electric field and quantify it through the left and right out-of-time-ordered correlation. To enhance the efficiency of the QID, we utilize a magnonic crystal. We excite magnons of different frequencies and let them propagate in opposite directions. Nonreciprocal magnons propagating in opposite directions have different dispersion relations. Magnons propagating in one direction match resonant conditions and scatter on gate magnons. Therefore, magnon flux in one direction is damped in the magnonic crystal leading to an asymmetric transport of quantum information in the QID. A QID can be fabricated from an yttrium iron garnet film. This is an experimentally feasible concept and implies certain conditions: low temperature and small deviation from the equilibrium to exclude effects of phonons and magnon interactions. We show that rectification of the flaw of quantum information can be controlled efficiently by an external electric field and magnetoelectric effects.

TI Designs from Local Random Quantum Circuits with SU(d) Symmetry
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB The generation of -designs (pseudorandom distributions that emulate the Haar measure up to moments) with local quantum circuit ensembles is a problem of fundamental importance in quantum information and physics. Despite the extensive understanding of this problem for ordinary random circuits, the crucial situations in which symmetries or conservation laws are in play are known to pose fundamental challenges and remain little understood. Here, we construct explicit local unitary ensembles that can achieve high-order unitary -designs under transversal continuous symmetry, in the particularly important SU(d) case. Specifically, we define the convolutional quantum alternating (CQA) group generated by 4-local SU(d)-symmetric Hamiltonians as well as associated 4-local SU(d)-symmetric random unitary circuit ensembles and prove that they form and converge to SU(d)-symmetric -designs, respectively, for all <( -3)/2, with being the number of qudits. A key technique that we employ to obtain the results is the Okounkov-Vershik approach to representation theory. To study the convergence time of the CQA ensemble, we develop a numerical method using the Young orthogonal form and the branching rule. We provide strong evidence for a subconstant spectral gap and certain convergence time scales of various important circuit architectures, which contrast with the symmetry-free case. We also provide comprehensive explanations of the difficulties and limitations in rigorously analyzing the convergence time using methods that have been effective for cases without symmetries, including Knabe's local gap threshold and Nachtergaele's martingale methods. This suggests that a novel approach is likely necessary for understanding the convergence time of SU(d)-symmetric local random circuits.

TI Adaptive variational quantum minimally entangled typical thermal states

AB Scalable quantum algorithms for the simulation of quantum many-body systems in thermal equilibrium are important for predicting properties of quantum matter at finite temperatures. Here we describe and benchmark a quantum computing version of the minimally entangled typical thermal states (METTS) algorithm for which we adopt an adaptive variational approach to perform the required quantum imaginary time evolution. The algorithm, which we name AVQMETTS, dynamically generates compact and problem-specific quantum circuits, which are suitable for noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) hardware. We benchmark AVQMETTS on statevector simulators and perform thermal energy calculations of integrable and nonintegrable quantum spin models in one and two dimensions and demonstrate an approximately linear system-size scaling of the circuit complexity. We further map out the finite-temperature phase transition line of the two-dimensional transverse field Ising model. Finally, we study the impact of noise on AVQMETTS calculations using a phenomenological noise model.

TI Free-Space QKD with Modulating Retroreflectors Based on the B92 Protocol
SO ENTROPY
AB Free-space quantum key distribution (QKD) has attracted considerable attention due to its lower channel loss and link flexibility. It allows two participants share theoretical unconditional secure keys, and can potentially be applied to air-to-ground quantum communication to establish a global quantum network. Free-space QKD using modulating retro-reflectors (MRR-QKD) significantly reduces the pointing requirement and simplifies the structure of the mobile terminal, therefore making it suitable for lightweight aircraft such as unmanned aerial vehicle and Cubesat, etc. Based on intensity modulation of two non-orthogonal states and the B92 protocol, we proposed a scheme to improve the previous work (Optics Express2018, 26, 11331). Our scheme simplifies the optical structure and shows more robustness in equipment imperfection. The analysis and simulation show that the number of multiple quantum well modulators needed in our scheme decreases from eight to three with similar performance. Additionally, while the previous scheme cannot work due to low modulator extinction ratio or high optical misalignment, our scheme can still operate.

TI Quantum emulation of the transient dynamics in the multistate
   Landau-Zener model
SO NPJ QUANTUM INFORMATION
AB Quantum simulation is one of the most promising near term applications of quantum computing. Especially, systems with a large Hilbert space are hard to solve for classical computers and thus ideal targets for a simulation with quantum hardware. In this work, we study experimentally the transient dynamics in the multistate Landau-Zener model as a function of the Landau-Zener velocity. The underlying Hamiltonian is emulated by superconducting quantum circuit, where a tunable transmon qubit is coupled to a bosonic mode ensemble comprising four lumped element microwave resonators. We investigate the model for different initial states: Due to our circuit design, we are not limited to merely exciting the qubit, but can also pump the harmonic modes via a dedicated drive line. Here, the nature of the transient dynamics depends on the average photon number in the excited resonator. The greater effective coupling strength between qubit and higher Fock states results in a quasi-adiabatic transition, where coherent quantum oscillations are suppressed without the introduction of additional loss channels. Our experiments pave the way for more complex simulations with qubits coupled to an engineered bosonic mode spectrum.

AB Neutral atom quantum computers (NAQCs) have emerged as promising candidates for scalable quantum computing, thanks to their advanced hardware capabilities, particularly qubit movement and the Zoned Architecture (ZA). However, fully harnessing these features presents significant compilation challenges, requiring careful coordination across gate scheduling, qubit positioning, atom movement, and inter-zone communication. In this paper, we propose PowerMove, an efficient compiler for NAQCs that unlocks new optimization opportunities, significantly improving qubit movement strategies while seamlessly integrating ZA. Our evaluation demonstrates orders-of-magnitude fidelity improvements over state-of-the-art methods, with execution time reduced by up to 3.76x and compilation time accelerated by up to 216.9x across various NISQ applications. Furthermore, PowerMove extends naturally to the fault-tolerant quantum computing (FTQC) setting, where physical qubits are replaced by logical qubits encoded in QEC codes, achieving a 4.78x reduction in execution time. These results highlight PowerMove's impact on both near-term NISQ applications and long-term FTQC implementations. We have open-sourced our codes at https://github.com/Scarlett0815/PowerMove to facilitate further research and collaboration within the community.

TI Quantum key recovery attack on SIMON32/64
SO CYBERSECURITY
AB The quantum security of lightweight block ciphers is receiving more and more attention. However, the existing quantum attacks on lightweight block ciphers only focused on the quantum exhaustive search, while the quantum attacks combined with classical cryptanalysis methods haven't been well studied. In this paper, we study quantum key recovery attack on SIMON32/64 using Quantum Amplitude Amplification algorithm in Q1 model. At first, we reanalyze the quantum circuit complexity of quantum exhaustive search on SIMON32/64. We estimate the Clifford gates count more accurately and reduce the T gate count. Also, the T-depth and full depth is reduced due to our minor modifications. Then, using four differentials given by Biryukov in FSE 2014 as our distinguisher, we give our quantum key recovery attack on 19-round SIMON32/64. We treat the two phases of key recovery attack as two QAA instances separately, and the first QAA instance consists of four sub-QAA instances. Then, we design the quantum circuit of these two QAA instances and estimate their corresponding quantum circuit complexity. We conclude that the quantum circuit of our quantum key recovery attack is lower than quantum exhaustive search. Our work firstly studies the quantum dedicated attack on SIMON32/64. And this is the first work to study the complexity of quantum dedicated attacks from the perspective of quantum circuit complexity, which is a more fine-grained analysis of quantum dedicated attacks' complexity.

TI Maximum power of coupled-qubit Otto engines
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB We put forward four schemes of a coupled-qubit quantum Otto machine, a generalization of the single-qubit quantum Otto machine, based on work and heat transfer between an internal system consisting of a coupled pair of qubits and an external environment consisting of two heat baths and two work storages. The four schemes of our model are defined by the positions of attaching the heat baths, which play a key role in the power of the coupled-qubit engine. First, for the single-qubit heat engine, we find a maximum-power relation, and the fact that its efficiency at the maximum power is equal to the Otto efficiency, which is greater than the Curzon-Ahlborn efficiency. Second, we compare the coupled-qubit engines to the single-qubit engine from the point of view of achieving the maximum power based on the same energy-level change for work production and find that the coupling between the two qubits can lead to greater powers but the system efficiency at the maximum power is lower than the single-qubit system's efficiency and the Curzon-Ahlborn efficiency.

TI Cavity magnomechanical storage and retrieval of quantum states
SO NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB We show how a quantum state in a microwave cavity mode can be transferred to and stored in a phononic mode via an intermediate magnon mode in a magnomechanical system. For this we consider a ferrimagnetic yttrium iron garnet (YIG) sphere inserted in a microwave cavity, where the microwave and magnon modes are coupled via a magnetic-dipole interaction and the magnon and phonon modes in the YIG sphere are coupled via magnetostrictive forces. By modulating the cavity and magnon detunings and the driving of the magnon mode in time, a stimulated Raman adiabatic passage-like coherent transfer becomes possible between the cavity mode and the phonon mode. The phononic mode can be used to store the photonic quantum state for long periods as it possesses lower damping than the photonic and magnon modes. Thus our proposed scheme offers a possibility of using magnomechanical systems as quantum memory for photonic quantum information.

TI Quantum correlations in three-beam symmetric Gaussian states accessed
   via photon-number-resolving detection and quantum universal invariants
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Quantum correlations of symmetric three-beam Gaussian states are analyzed using their quantum universal invariants. These invariants, one-, two-, and three-beam purities, are expressed in terms of the beams' intensity moments up to sixth order. The three-beam symmetric Gaussian states with varying amounts of the noise are experimentally generated using entangled photon pairs from down-conversion, their invariants are determined, and their quantum correlations are quantified. The coexistence of bipartite and tripartite entanglement and genuine tripartite entanglement is observed in these states that resemble the noisy GHZ/W states.

TI Topological quantum computation using analog gravitational holonomy and
   time dilation
SO SCIPOST PHYSICS CORE
AB Non-universal topological quantum computation models, such as the Majorana fermionbased Ising anyon model, have to be supplemented with an additional non-topological noisy gate in order to achieve universality. Here we endeavour to remedy this using an Einstein-Cartan analog gravity picture of scalar fields. Specifically, we show that the analog gravity picture enables unitary transformations to be realized in two distinct ways: (i) via space-time holonomy and (ii) as gravitational time dilation. The non-abelian geometric phases are enabled by gravitational interactions, which are mediated by the spin-connection. We analytically compute its matrix elements as a function of the scalar field density distribution. This density can be regarded as the gravitating distribution of matter in an analog universe. We show via explicit calculations that there exists an infinite set of asymptotically flat analog gravitational fields, each of which implements a unique unitary transformation, that render the interactions topological. We emphasise the generality of this result by asserting that such gravitational gates could potentially be implemented in a broad range of real systems modeled by scalar field with an acoustic metric.

TI Exploiting the Quantum Advantage for Satellite Image Processing: Review
   and Assessment
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON QUANTUM ENGINEERING
AB This article examines the current status of quantum computing (QC) in Earth observation and satellite imagery. We analyze the potential limitations and applications of quantum learning models when dealing with satellite data, considering the persistent challenges of profiting from quantum advantage and finding the optimal sharing between high-performance computing (HPC) and QC. We then assess some parameterized quantum circuit models transpiled into a Clifford+T universal gate set. The T-gates shed light on the quantum resources required to deploy quantum models, either on an HPC system or several QC systems. In particular, if the T-gates cannot be simulated efficiently on an HPC system, we can apply a quantum computer and its computational power over conventional techniques. Our quantum resource estimation showed that quantum machine learning (QML) models, with a sufficient number of T-gates, provide the quantum advantage if and only if they generalize on unseen data points better than their classical counterparts deployed on the HPC system and they break the symmetry in their weights at each learning iteration like in conventional deep neural networks. We also estimated the quantum resources required for some QML models as an initial innovation. Lastly, we defined the optimal sharing between an HPC+QC system for executing QML models for hyperspectral satellite images. These are a unique dataset compared with other satellite images since they have a limited number of input quantum bits and a small number of labeled benchmark images, making them less challenging to deploy on quantum computers.

TI High-performance, additively-manufactured atomic spectroscopy apparatus
   for portable quantum technologies
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB We demonstrate a miniaturised and highly robust system for performing Doppler-free spectroscopy on thermal atomic vapour for three frequencies as required for cold atom-based quantum technologies. The application of additive manufacturing techniques, together with efficient use of optical components, produce a compact, stable optical system, with a volume of 0.089 L and a weight of 120 g. The device occupies less than a tenth of the volume of, and is considerably lower cost than, conventional spectroscopic systems, but also offers excellent stability against environmental disturbances. We characterise the response of the system to changes in environmental temperature between 7 and 35 degrees C and exposure to vibrations between 0 - 2000 Hz, finding that the system can reliably perform spectroscopic measurements despite substantial vibrational noise and temperature changes. Our results show that 3D-printed optical systems are an excellent solution for portable quantum technologies.

TI Encryption chain based on measurement result and its applications on
   semi-quantum key distribution protocol
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB This study proposes a new encoding method, also known as an encryption chain based on the measurement result. Then, using the encryption chain to propose a unitary-operation-based semi-quantum key distribution protocol (SQKD) protocol. In the existing SQKD protocols, semi-quantum environments adopt a round-trip transmission strategy. In round-trip transmission, the classical participant must resend the received photons to the quantum participant after implementing local operations. Therefore, round-trip transmissions are vulnerable to Trojan horse attacks. Hence, the classical participant must be equipped with a photon number splitter and an optical wavelength filter device against Trojan horse attacks. This is illogical for semi-quantum environments because the burden on the classical participant is significantly increased as it involves the prevention of Trojan horse attacks. The proposed SQKD protocol is congenitally immune to Trojan horse attacks and involves no extra hardware because it is designed based on a one-way transmission as opposed to a round-trip transmission. When compared to the existing SQKD protocols, the proposed SQKD protocol provides the best qubit efficiency, and classical participants only require two quantum capabilities, which enhance its practicability. Moreover, the proposed SQKD protocol is free from collective attacks, Trojan horse attacks, and intercept-resend attacks. Thus, the proposed scheme is more efficient and practical than the existing SQKD protocols.

TI Experimental simulation of daemonic work extraction in open quantum
   batteries on a digital quantum computer
SO QUANTUM SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB The possibility of extracting more work from a physical system thanks to the information obtained from measurements has been a topic of fundamental interest in the context of thermodynamics since the formulation of the Maxwell's demon thought experiment. We here consider this problem from the perspective of an open quantum battery interacting with an environment that can be continuously measured. By modeling it via a continuously monitored collisional model, we show how to implement the corresponding dynamics as a quantum circuit, including the final conditional feedback unitary evolution that allows to enhance the amount of work extracted. By exploiting the flexibility of IBM quantum computers and by properly modelling the corresponding quantum circuit, we experimentally simulate the work extraction protocol showing how the obtained experimental values of the daemonic extracted work are close to their theoretical upper bound quantified by the so-called daemonic ergotropy. We also demonstrate how by properly modelling the noise affecting the quantum circuit, one can improve the work extraction protocol by optimizing the corresponding extraction unitary feedback operation.

TI Imaging a chain of strongly correlated Rydberg excitations enabled by
   Forster-resonance-enhanced interaction
SO OPTICA
AB Rydberg atoms are currently a very fast-advancing quantum platform. For many interesting and demanding applications, including quantum computation, fast detection of a Rydberg excitation or a Rydberg qubit for information readout would be one of the most desirable developments. We demonstrate single-shot and in situ absorption imaging of individual Rydberg excitations. This level of resolution is achieved using an electromagnetically induced transparency scheme involving a Rydberg energy level that is highly sensitive to the presence of Rydberg atoms due to Forsterresonance-enhanced dipole couplings. Spectroscopic measurements illustrate the existence of the Forster resonance and underscore the state-selectivity of the technique. With an imaging exposure time as short as 3 mu s, we successfully resolve linear chains of Rydberg excitations in a one-dimensional configuration. The extracted second-order correlation shows strong anti-bunching due to excitation blockade, and a Fourier analysis reveals the long-range order in the chains of Rydberg excitations. This imaging technique, with minimal destruction, will be of great interest for leveraging ensemble-encoded qubits in quantum computation and quantum simulation applications.

TI POST-QUANTUM CRYPTOGRAPHY FOR HEALTHCARE: A NUMBER THEORY BASED
   TWO-FACTOR MUTUAL AUTHENTICATION LATTICES FOR TMIS
SO ADVANCES AND APPLICATIONS IN DISCRETE MATHEMATICS
AB The telecare medical information system (TMIS) allows patients to access health services from their homes. It is therefore necessary to preserve privacy of the patient and to secure the communications between the patient/user and the gateway/server for TMIS (Gw, briefly). We propose a new ring learning with error (RLWE) based on two -factor authentication and key exchange protocol, post-quantum secure, for healthcare platform by using a similar protocol of Ding et al. at Cryptographers' Track at the RSA Conference in 2017 [32]. Our protocol involves four phases: user registration phase, login phase, mutual authentication and key agreement phase, and user's password change phase. Gw has a long-term public key (ps) and a private key (xs). The user has a password pwd. The user's personal device/smartphone (PD, briefly) has a long-term secret key xu. This secret key xu is encrypted by pwd and stored on PD. The PD and the Gw share a long-term password S. This shared password S is calculated by Gw from its secret xs and the hash of the user's id (H1(..., id, xu)). Gw sends S to PD through a secure channel. At user's side, S is encrypted (stored on PD) with pwd and the PD's long-term secret key xu. Note that S and id are not stored on Gw. For privacy, all the information required for user's authentication are securely stored on PD and no information of the user is stored on Gw. pwd can be frequently changed offline (inside the PD).

TI Visualizing heterogeneous dipole fields by terahertz light coupling in
   individual nano-junctions
SO COMMUNICATIONS PHYSICS
AB To enhance the development of superior quantum circuits, the ability to detect defects accurately is crucial. The authors use broadband terahertz scanning near-field optical microscopy that enables the non-destructive and contactless identification of defective boundaries in nano-junctions employed in transmon qubits at an extremely precise nanoscale level.
   The challenge underlying superconducting quantum computing is to remove materials bottleneck for highly coherent quantum devices. The nonuniformity and complex structural components in the underlying quantum circuits often lead to local electric field concentration, charge scattering, dissipation and ultimately decoherence. Here we visualize interface dipole heterogeneous distribution of individual Al/AlOx/Al junctions employed in transmon qubits by broadband terahertz scanning near-field microscopy that enables the non-destructive and contactless identification of defective boundaries in nano-junctions at an extremely precise nanoscale level. Our THz nano-imaging tool reveals an asymmetry across the junction in electromagnetic wave-junction coupling response that manifests as hot (high intensity) vs cold (low intensity) spots in the spatial electrical field structures and correlates with defected boundaries from the multi-angle deposition processes in Josephson junction fabrication inside qubit devices. The demonstrated local electromagnetic scattering method offers high sensitivity, allowing for reliable device defect detection in the pursuit of improved quantum circuit fabrication for ultimately optimizing coherence times.

AB Y The emergence of quantum computers is threatening the security of cryptography through various quantum algorithms. Among them, the Grover search algorithm is known to be efficient in accelerating brute force attacks on block cipher algorithms. To utilize the Grover's algorithm for brute force attacks, block ciphers must be implemented in quantum circuits. In this paper, we present optimized quantum circuits of the SPN (Substitution Permutation Network) structured lightweight block cipher, namely the PIPO block cipher. In particular, the compact design of quantum circuits for the 8-bit Sbox is investigated. These optimization techniques are used to implement other cryptographic operations as quantum circuits. Finally, we evaluate quantum resources of Grover search algorithm for the PIPO block cipher in ProejctQ, a quantum simulator provided by IBM.

TI Manipulating Single-Photon Emission from Point Defects in Diamond and

SO ADVANCED QUANTUM TECHNOLOGIES
AB Point defects in semiconductors are emerging as an important contender platform for quantum technology (QT) applications, showing potential for quantum computing, communication, and sensing. Indeed, point defects have been employed as nuclear spins for nanoscale sensing and memory in quantum registers, localized electron spins for quantum bits, and emitters of single photons in quantum communication and cryptography. However, to utilize point defects in semiconductors as single-photon sources for QT, control over the influence of the surrounding environment on the emission process must be first established. Recent works have revealed strong manipulation of emission energies and intensities via coupling of point defect wavefunctions to external factors such as electric fields, strain and photonic devices. This review presents the state-of-the-art on manipulation, tuning, and control of single-photon emission from point defects focusing on two leading semiconductor materials-diamond and silicon carbide.

TI A Bright Squeezed Light Source for Quantum Sensing
SO CHEMOSENSORS
AB The use of optical sensing for in vivo applications is compelling, since it offers the advantages of non-invasiveness, non-ionizing radiation, and real-time monitoring. However, the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of the optical signal deteriorates dramatically as the biological tissue increases. Although increasing laser power can improve the SNR, intense lasers can severely disturb biological processes and viability. Quantum sensing with bright squeezed light can make the measurement sensitivity break through the quantum noise limit under weak laser conditions. A bright squeezed light source is demonstrated to avoid the deterioration of SNR and biological damage, which integrates an external cavity frequency-doubled laser, a semi-monolithic standing cavity with periodically poled titanyl phosphate (PPKTP), and a balanced homodyne detector (BHD) assembled on a dedicated breadboard. With the rational design of the mechanical elements, the optical layout, and the feedback control equipment, a maximum non-classical noise reduction of -10.7 +/- 0.2 dB is observed. The average squeeze of -10 +/- 0.2 dB in continuous operation for 60 min is demonstrated. Finally, the intracavity loss of degenerate optical parametric amplifier (DOPA) and the initial bright squeezed light can be calculated to be 0.0021 and -15.5 +/- 0.2 dB, respectively. Through the above experimental and theoretical analysis, the direction of improving bright squeeze level is pointed out.

TI On the role of symmetry and geometry in global quantum sensing
SO QUANTUM SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB Global quantum sensing enables parameter estimation across arbitrary ranges with a finite number of measurements. Among the various existing formulations, the Bayesian paradigm stands as a flexible approach for optimal protocol design under minimal assumptions. Within this paradigm, however, there are two fundamentally different ways to capture prior ignorance and uninformed estimation; namely, requiring invariance of the prior distribution under specific parameter transformations, or adhering to the geometry of a state space. In this paper we carefully examine the practical consequences of both the invariance-based and the geometry-based approaches, and show how to apply them in relevant examples of rate and coherence estimation in noisy settings. We find that, while the invariance-based approach often leads to simpler priors and estimators and is more broadly applicable in adaptive scenarios, the geometry-based one can lead to faster posterior convergence in a well-defined measurement setting. Crucially, by employing the notion of location-isomorphic parameters, we are able to unify the two formulations into a single practical and versatile framework for optimal global quantum sensing, detailing when and how each set of assumptions should be employed to tackle any given estimation task. We thus provide a blueprint for the design of novel high-precision quantum sensors.

TI Precise and extensive characterization of an optical resonator for
   cavity-based quantum networks
SO OPTICS CONTINUUM
AB Cavity-based quantum node is a competitive platform for distributed quantum networks. Here, we characterize a high-finesse Fabry-P??rot optical resonator for coupling single or few atomic quantum registers. Our cavity consists of two mirrors with different reflectivities: One has minimal optical loss, and the other high transmission loss where more than 90% of the intracavity photons would be emitted. Cavity finesse, birefringent effects, and mechanical resonances are measured using the lasers at 780, 782, and 795 nm. In order to obtain cavity geometric parameters, we drive the adjacent longitudinal or transverse modes with two lasers simultaneously, and measure those frequencies using a precision wavelength meter (WLM). A major novelty of this method is that the parameters??? uncertainties are solely determined by the resolution of the WLM, eliminating all of the temporal environment fluctuations. Our scheme makes it possible to quantify the atom-cavity coupling constant up to four significant figures, the most precise and accurate estimation so far, which would become a key ingredient for benchmarking a cavity-based quantum node. Furthermore, the distortion of polarized photonic qubits would be minimized owing to the small birefringent splitting, below 4.9% of the cavity linewidth. Our system should operate in the intermediate atom-cavity coupling regime that would allow us to implement various quantum network protocols.

TI Quantum architecture search with neural predictor based on ZX-calculus
SO EPJ QUANTUM TECHNOLOGY
AB With the ongoing advances in noisy intermediate-scale quantum hardware, variational quantum algorithms have demonstrated significant potential in a range of quantum applications. However, obtaining high-performance, shallow-parameterized quantum circuits typically requires repeated optimization of the gate parameters over a large set of candidate circuits, resulting in prohibitively high evaluation costs. To address this challenge, this study proposes a novel predictor-based quantum architecture search (PQAS-ZX) method that leverages ZX-calculus. In this approach, a quantum circuit is first represented as a ZX diagram that supports multi-step equivalent simplifications at the diagram level. By applying these equivalence transformations, multiple circuit variants that share the same performance metric are generated, thereby significantly expanding the training dataset and enhancing the ability of the predictor to manage diverse circuit structures. ZX diagrams offer more flexible characterizations of multi-qubit entanglement and phase interactions, as well as higher-level equivalent transformations, compared with the state-of-the-art predictor-based quantum architecture search with graph measures (PQAS-GM). Numerical simulations of three variational quantum eigensolver tasks, namely the transverse-field Ising, Heisenberg, and BeH2 molecular models, demonstrated that PQAS-ZX required only approximately 80.9%, 82.9%, and 76.1% of the queries required by PQAS-GM, respectively, to achieve the same probability of reaching the target ground-state energy. These results highlight the advantage of using ZX diagrams to identify high-quality circuits efficiently and alleviate the evaluation burden of quantum architecture searches.

TI Hole Spin Qubits in Si FinFETs With Fully Tunable Spin-Orbit Coupling
   and Sweet Spots for Charge Noise
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB The strong spin-orbit coupling in hole spin qubits enables fast and electrically tunable gates, but at the same time enhances the susceptibility of the qubit to charge noise. Suppressing this noise is a significant challenge in semiconductor quantum computing. Here, we show theoretically that hole Si fin field-effect transistors (FinFETs) are not only very compatible with modern CMOS technology, but they present operational sweet spots where the charge noise is completely removed. The presence of these sweet spots is a result of the interplay between the anisotropy of the material and the triangular shape of the FinFET cross section, and it does not require an extreme fine-tuning of the electrostatics of the device. We present how the sweet spots appear in FinFETs grown along different crystallographic axes and we study in detail how the behavior of these devices changes when the cross-section area and aspect ratio are varied. We identify designs that maximize the qubit performance and could pave the way towards a scalable spin-based quantum computer.

TI High-dimensional spin-orbital single-photon sources
SO SCIENCE ADVANCES
AB Hybrid integration of solid-state quantum emitters (QEs) into nanophotonic structures opens enticing perspectives for exploiting multiple degrees of freedom of single-photon sources for on-chip quantum photonic applications. However, the state-of-the-art single-photon sources are mostly limited to two-level states or scalar vortex beams. Direct generation of high-dimensional structured single photons remains challenging, being still in its infancy. Here, we propose a general strategy to design highly entangled high-dimensional spin-orbital single-photon sources by taking full advantage of the spatial freedom to design QE-coupled composite (i.e., Moir & eacute;/multipart) metasurfaces. We demonstrate the generation of arbitrary vectorial spin-orbital photon emission in high-dimensional Hilbert spaces, mapping the generated states on hybrid-order Bloch spheres. We further realize single-photon sources of high-dimensional spin-orbital quantum emission and experimentally verify the entanglement of high-dimensional superposition states with high fidelity. We believe that the results obtained facilitate further progress in integrated solutions for the deployment of next-generation high-capacity quantum information technologies.

TI Efficient Simulation of Parametrized Quantum Circuits under Nonunital
   Noise through Pauli Backpropagation
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB As quantum devices continue to grow in size but remain affected by noise, it is crucial to determine when and how they can outperform classical computers on practical tasks. A central piece in this effort is to develop the most efficient classical simulation algorithms possible. Among the most promising approaches are Pauli backpropagation algorithms, which have already demonstrated their ability to efficiently simulate certain classes of parameterized quantum circuits-a leading contender for near-term quantum advantage-under random circuit assumptions and depolarizing noise. However, their efficiency was not previously established for more realistic nonunital noise models, such as amplitude damping, that better capture noise on existing hardware. Here, we close this gap by adapting Pauli backpropagation to nonunital noise, proving that it remains efficient even under these more challenging conditions. Our proof leverages a refined combinatorial analysis to handle the complexities introduced by nonunital channels, thus strengthening Pauli backpropagation as a powerful tool for simulating near-term quantum devices.

TI Phase-selective tripartite entanglement and asymmetric
   Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen steering in squeezed optomechanics
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB The generation and manipulation of multipartite entanglement and Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR) steering in macroscopic systems not only play a fundamental role in exploring the nature of quantum mechanics, but are also at the core of current developments of various nascent quantum technologies. Here we report a theoretical method using squeezing-phase-controlled quantum noise flows to selectively generate and manipulate quantum entanglement and asymmetric EPR steering in a nonlinear chi(2) whispering-gallery-mode (WGM) optomechanical resonator. We show that by pumping the chi (2) nonlinear medium with two-photon optical fields and broadband squeezed lights, a pair of counterpropagating squeezed optical modes could be introduced to the WGM resonator, each coupled with an independent squeezed vacuum reservoir. This configuration could enable squeezing-phase-controlled light-reservoir interaction for each squeezed optical mode, providing a flexible tool for tailoring asymmetric optical noise flows in the counterpropagating modes. Based on this unique feature, it is found that with the injection of asymmetric noise flows, the generation of various types of bipartite and tripartite entanglement become phase-dependent, and thus they can be produced in an asymmetric way. More excitingly, it is also found that by further properly adjusting the squeezing parameters, the overall asymmetry of EPR steering can also be stepwise driven from a no-way regime, to a one-way regime, to a two-way regime. These findings, holding promise for preparing rich types of entangled quantum resources with asymmetric features, may have potential applications in the area of secure quantum information processing such as quantum secure direct communication and one-way quantum computing.

TI Quantum deep transfer learning
SO NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB Quantum machine learning (QML) has aroused great interest because it has the potential to speed up the established classical machine learning processes. However, the present QML models can merely be trained on the dataset of single domain of interest. This severely limits the application of the QML to the scenario where only small datasets are available. In this work, we have proposed a QML model that allows the transfer of the knowledge from one domain encoded by quantum states to another, which is called quantum transfer learning. Using such a model, we demonstrate that the classification accuracy can be greatly improved for the training process on small datasets, comparing with the results obtained by former QML algorithm. Last but not least, we have proved that the complexity of our algorithm is basically logarithmic, which can be considered an exponential speedup over the related classical algorithms.

TI Quantum computing for smart grid applications
SO IET GENERATION TRANSMISSION & DISTRIBUTION
AB Computational complexities in modern power systems are reportedly increasing daily, and it is anticipated that traditional computers might be inadequate to provide the computation prerequisite in future complex power grids. In that given context, quantum computing (QC) can be considered a next-generation alternative solution to deal with upcoming computational challenges in smart grids. The QC is a relatively new yet promising technology that leverages the unique phenomena of quantum mechanics in processing information and computations. This emerging paradigm shows a significant potential to overcome the barrier of computational limitations with better and faster solutions in optimization, simulations, and machine learning problems. In recent years, substantial progress in developing advanced quantum hardware, software, and algorithms have made QC more feasible to apply in various research areas, including smart grids. It is evident that considerable research has already been carried out, and such efforts are remarkably continuing. As QC is a highly evolving field of study, a brief review of the existing literature will be vital to realize the state-of-art on QC for smart grid applications. Therefore, this article summarizes the research outcomes of the most recent papers, highlights their suggestions for utilizing QC techniques for various smart grid applications, and further identifies the potential smart grid applications. Several real-world QC case studies in various research fields besides power and energy systems are demonstrated. Moreover, a brief overview of available quantum hardware specifications, software tools, and algorithms is described with a comparative analysis.

TI Holographic dynamics simulations with a trapped-ion quantum computer
SO NATURE PHYSICS
AB The simulation of quantum dynamics is a challenging task to solve with classical resources. An experiment with a trapped-ion quantum processor now shows the efficient simulation of the evolution of large-scale many-body quantum systems.
   Quantum computers promise to efficiently simulate quantum dynamics, a classically intractable task central to fields ranging from chemistry to high-energy physics. Yet, quantum computational advantage has only been demonstrated for artificial tasks such as random circuit sampling, and hardware limitations and noise have limited experiments to qualitative studies of small-scale systems. Quantum processors capable of high-fidelity measurements and qubit reuse enable a recently proposed holographic technique that employs quantum tensor-network states, a class of states that efficiently compress quantum data, to simulate the evolution of infinitely long, entangled initial states using a small number of qubits. Here we benchmark this holographic technique in a trapped-ion quantum processor using 11 qubits to simulate the dynamics of an infinite entangled state. We observe the hallmarks of quantum chaos and light-cone propagation of correlations, and find excellent quantitative agreement with theoretical predictions for the infinite-size limit of the implemented model with minimal post-processing or error mitigation. These results show that quantum tensor-network methods, paired with state-of-the-art quantum processor capabilities, offer a viable route to practical quantum computational advantage on problems of direct interest to science and technology in the near term.

TI Dispersive regime of multiphoton qubit-oscillator interactions
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB The dispersive regime of n-photon qubit-oscillator interactions is analyzed using Schrieffer-Wolff perturbation theory. Effective Hamiltonians are derived up to the second order in the perturbation parameters. These effective descriptions reveal higher-order qubit-oscillator cross-Kerr and oscillator self-Kerr terms. The cross-Kerr term combines a qubit Pauli operator with an n-degree polynomial in the oscillator photon number operator, while the self-Kerr term is an (n-1)-degree polynomial in the oscillator photon number operator. In addition to the higher-order Kerr terms, a qubit-conditional 2n-photon squeezing term appears in the effective non-rotating-wave-approximation Hamiltonian. Furthermore, perturbation theory is applied to the case of multiple qubits coupled to a shared oscillator. A photon-number-dependent qubit-qubit interaction emerges in this case, which can be leveraged to tune the effective multiqubit system parameters using the oscillator state. Results for the converse setup of multiple oscillators and a single qubit are also derived. In this case, a qubitconditional oscillator-oscillator nonlinear interaction is found. The spectral instabilities plaguing multiphoton qubit-oscillator models are carefully treated by introducing stabilizing higher-order terms in the Hamiltonian. The stabilizing terms preserve low-photon subspaces, avoid negative infinite energies, and facilitate reliable numerical calculations used to validate analytical predictions. The effective descriptions developed here offer a simple and intuitive physical picture of dispersive multiphoton qubit-oscillator interactions that can aid in the design of implementations harnessing various nonlinear effects.

TI Quantum correlations, mixed states, and bistability at the onset of
   lasing
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB We derive a model for a single-mode laser that includes all two-particle quantum correlations between photons and electrons. In contrast to the predictions of semiclassical models, we find that lasing takes place in the presence of quantum bistability between a nonlasing and a nonclassical coherent state. The coherent state is characterized by a central frequency and a finite linewidth and emerges with finite amplitude from a saddle-node bifurcation together with an unstable coherent state. Hence coherent emission in nanolasers originates through a mixing of lasing and nonlasing states. In the limit of a macrolaser with a large number of emitters and nonresonant modes, the laser threshold approaches the prediction of the semiclassical theory, but with the important difference that lasing can be achieved only in the presence of finite-size perturbations.

TI Recovering Quantum Correlations in Optical Lattices from Interaction
   Quenches
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB Quantum simulations with ultracold atoms in optical lattices open up an exciting path toward understanding strongly interacting quantum systems. Atom gas microscopes are crucial for this as they offer single-site density resolution, unparalleled in other quantum many-body systems. However, currently a direct measurement of local coherent currents is out of reach. In this Letter, we show how to achieve that by measuring densities that are altered in response to quenches to noninteracting dynamics, e.g., after tilting the optical lattice. For this, we establish a data analysis method solving the closed set of equations relating tunneling currents and atom number dynamics, allowing us to reliably recover the full covariance matrix, including off-diagonal terms representing coherent currents. The signal processing builds upon semi-definite optimization, providing bona fide covariance matrices optimally matching the observed data. We demonstrate how the obtained information about noncommuting observables allows one to quantify entanglement at finite temperature, which opens up the possibility to study quantum correlations in quantum simulations going beyond classical capabilities.

TI Rigidifying Qubit Candidates in a Cu-Porphyrin Nanohoop: Dipolar
   Coupling in Spin Pairs and Spin-Polarized Ground State
SO ANGEWANDTE CHEMIE-INTERNATIONAL EDITION
AB Assembling molecular qubit candidates with precise control over the position and orientation of spin centers is an important contemporary challenge for synthesis. In this work, we show that the rigidity of highly strained macrocycles from the cycloparaphenylene family gives rise to distinct spin-spin and light-spin interactions that make such few-qubit systems a promising testing ground for future quantum technologies. We synthesized conjugated nanohoop Cu[3]CPTA that comprises three Cu(II)porphyrin centers (S = 1/2) with a Cu-Cu distance of ca. 18 & Aring; (by single-crystal X-ray diffraction). Continuous-wave (cw) and pulse electron-paramagnetic resonance (EPR) studies revealed that dipolar coupling in spin pairs is so well defined in this nanohoop that the Cu-Cu distance can be determined accurately via double electron-electron resonance (DEER). By transient cwEPR, we observed a rare case of a light-induced polarization of a doublet ground state in frozen solution. The fact that ground state polarization was significantly less pronounced in a comparable, but more flexible macrocycle will inspire future efforts to better understand and harness this effect.

We deployed structural equation modeling to analyze data from a survey conducted among 96 top managers in various industries from Canada, the US, and Europe, including IT-based small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) dealing with QC software development. Our survey analysis indicates that the complexity of QC systems and software is the main barrier to the future adoption of quantum computing. This research offers insights into how future quantum computers can impact the security and privacy of information, emphasizing the importance of privacy protection. In this context, the study contributes to the notion of privacy engineering in the complex context of QC. The study established important outlines and tools for shaping future QCs. Our study, backed by empirical evidence, underscores the significant impact of new technology on citizens', organizations', firms', and government-private data. The results provide a clear message to policymakers, industry leaders, and developers: privacy engineering should be an integral part of technical development, and it's crucial to act before costs escalate. In this context, our study stands out as one of the few that use NLP and structural equation modeling to address privacy challenges in QC research through experimental research, offering practical solutions to real-world problems.

TI Coherent randomized benchmarking
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Randomized benchmarking is a powerful technique to efficiently estimate the performance and reliability of quantum gates, circuits, and devices. Here, we propose to perform randomized benchmarking in a coherent way, where superpositions of different random sequences rather than independent samples are used. We show that this leads to a uniform and simple protocol having significant advantages with respect to gates that can be benchmarked, and in terms of efficiency and scalability. We show that, e.g., universal gate sets, the set of n-qudit Pauli operators or more general sets including arbitrary unitaries, as well as a particular n-qudit Clifford gate using only the Pauli set, can be efficiently benchmarked. The price to pay is an additional complexity to add control to the involved quantum operations. However, we demonstrate that this can be done by using auxiliary degrees of freedom that are naturally available in basically any physical realization, and are independent of the gates to be tested.

TI Advancements and challenges in plasmon-exciton quantum emitters based on
   colloidal quantum dots and perovskite nanocrystals
SO MATERIALS FOR QUANTUM TECHNOLOGY
AB The Nobel Prizes in Physics (2022) and Chemistry (2023) heralded the recognition of quantum information science and the synthesis of quantum dots (QDs), respectively. This acknowledgment has propelled colloidal QDs and perovskite nanocrystals to the forefront of quantum technologies. Their distinct emission properties, facilitating the efficient generation of both single photons and photon pairs, render them particularly captivating. Moreover, their adaptability to diverse structures, ranging from traditional electronics to nanopatterned frameworks, underscores their pivotal role in shaping quantum technologies. Despite notable strides in synthesis, certain properties require refinement for enhanced applicability in quantum information, encompassing emission brightness, stability, single-photon indistinguishability, and entanglement fidelity of photon pairs. Here we offer an overview of recent achievements in plasmon-exciton quantum emitters (QEs) based on luminescent semiconductor nanocrystals. Emphasizing the utilization of the light-matter coupling phenomenon, we explore how this interaction enables the manipulation of quantum properties without altering the chemical structure of the emitters. This approach addresses critical aspects for quantum information applications, offering precise control over emission rate, intensity, and energy. The development of these hybrid systems represents a significant stride forward, demonstrating their potential to overcome existing challenges and advance the integration of QEs into cutting-edge quantum technology applications.

TI Efficient verification of entangled continuous-variable quantum states
   with local measurements
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Continuous-variable quantum states are of particular importance in various quantum information processing tasks including quantum communication and quantum sensing. However, a bottleneck has emerged with the fast increasing in size of the quantum systems which severely hinders their efficient characterization. In this work, we establish a systematic framework for verifying entangled continuous-variable quantum states by employing local measurements only. Our protocol is able to achieve the unconditionally high verification efficiency which is quadratically better than quantum tomography as well as other nontomographic methods. Specifically, we demonstrate the power of our protocol by showing the efficient verification of entangled two-mode and multimode coherent states with local measurements.

TI Optical-density enhanced quantum entanglement via four-wave mixing
   process
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB We theoretically propose a scheme to generate a strong continuous-variable quantum entangled light source in four-wave mixing (FWM) process by increasing the optical density of atomic medium. By properly choosing the input coupling field Rabi frequency and detuning, the optimized entanglement can be achieved to be better than -17 dB at an optical density of approximately 1, 000, which has been realized in atomic media. Besides, with the optimized one-photon detuning and coupling Rabi frequency, the optimum entanglement degree can be greatly enhanced with the increment of optical density. We also examine the effects of atomic decoherence rate and two-photon detuning on entanglement in a realistic setting, and evaluate the experimental feasibility. We find that the entanglement can be further improved by considering two-photon detuning. In addition, with optimum parameters the entanglement is robust against the decoherence. The strong entanglement provides a promising applications in continuous-variable quantum communications.

TI Optimal metrology with programmable quantum sensors
SO NATURE
AB Quantum sensors are an established technology that has created new opportunities for precision sensing across the breadth of science. Using entanglement for quantum enhancement will allow us to construct the next generation of sensors that can approach the fundamental limits of precision allowed by quantum physics. However, determining how state-of-the-art sensing platforms may be used to converge to these ultimate limits is an outstanding challenge. Here we merge concepts from the field of quantum information processing with metrology, and successfully implement experimentally a programmable quantum sensor operating close to the fundamental limits imposed by the laws of quantum mechanics. We achieve this by using low-depth, parametrized quantum circuits implementing optimal input states and measurement operators for a sensing task on a trapped-ion experiment. With 26 ions, we approach the fundamental sensing limit up to a factor of 1.45 +/- 0.01, outperforming conventional spin-squeezing with a factor of 1.87 +/- 0.03. Our approach reduces the number of averages to reach a given Allan deviation by a factor of 1.59 +/- 0.06 compared with traditional methods not using entanglement-enabled protocols. We further perform on-device quantum-classical feedback optimization to 'self-calibrate' the programmable quantum sensor with comparable performance. This ability illustrates that this next generation of quantum sensor can be used without previous knowledge of the device or its noise environment.

TI From exponential to quadratic: optimal control for a frustrated Ising
   ring model
SO QUANTUM SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB Exponentially small spectral gaps are known to be the crucial bottleneck for traditional Quantum Annealing (QA) based on interpolating between two Hamiltonians, a simple driving term and the complex problem to be solved, with a linear schedule in time. One of the simplest models exhibiting exponentially small spectral gaps is a ferromagnetic Ising ring with a single antiferromagnetic bond introducing frustration. Previous studies of this model have explored continuous-time diabatic QA, where optimized non-adiabatic annealing schedules provided good solutions, avoiding exponentially large annealing times. In our work, we move to a digital framework of Variational Quantum Algorithms, and present two main results: (1) we show that the model is digitally controllable with a scaling of resources that grows quadratically with the system size, achieving the exact solution using the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm; (2) We combine a technique of quantum control-the Chopped RAndom Basis method-and digitized quantum annealing to construct smooth digital schedules yielding optimal solutions with very high accuracy.

TI Prediction of chaotic dynamics and extreme events: A recurrence-free
   quantum reservoir computing approach
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB In chaotic dynamical systems, extreme events manifest in time series as unpredictable large-amplitude peaks. Although deterministic, extreme events appear seemingly randomly, which makes their forecasting difficult. By learning the dynamics from observables (data), reservoir computers can time accurately predict extreme events and chaotic dynamics, but they may require many degrees of freedom (large reservoirs). In this paper, by exploiting quantum-computer ans & auml;tze and entanglement, we design reservoir computers with compact reservoirs and accurate prediction capabilities. First, we propose the recurrence-free quantum reservoir computer (RFQRC) architecture. By developing ad hoc quantum feature maps and removing recurrent connections, the RFQRC has quantum circuits with smaller depths. This allows the RF-QRC to scale well with higher-dimensional chaotic systems, which makes it suitable for hardware implementation. Second, we forecast the temporal chaotic dynamics and their long-term statistics of low- and higher-dimensional dynamical systems. We find that RFQRC requires smaller reservoirs than classical reservoir computers for higher-dimensional systems and the same predictability. Third, we apply the RF-QRC to the time prediction of extreme events in a model of a turbulent shear flow with turbulent bursts. We find that the RF-QRC has longer predictability than the classical reservoir computer for extreme events forecasting. The results and analyses indicate that quantum-computer ans & auml;tze offers nonlinear expressivity and computational scalability, which are useful for forecasting chaotic dynamics and extreme events. This work opens new opportunities for using quantum machine learning on near-term quantum computers.

TI Spatially Resolved Quantum Sensing with High-Density Bubble-Printed
   Nanodiamonds
SO NANO LETTERS
AB Nitrogen-vacancy (NV-) centers in nanodiamonds have emerged as a versatile platform for a wide range of applications, including bioimaging, photonics, and quantum sensing. However, the widespread adoption of nanodiamonds in practical applications has been hindered by the challenges associated with patterning them into high-resolution features with sufficient throughput. In this work, we overcome these limitations by introducing a direct laser-writing bubble printing technique that enables the precise fabrication of two-dimensional nanodiamond patterns. The printed nanodiamonds exhibit a high packing density and strong photoluminescence emission, as well as robust optically detected magnetic resonance (ODMR) signals. We further harness the spatially resolved ODMR of the nanodiamond patterns to demonstrate the mapping of two-dimensional temperature gradients using high frame rate widefield lock-in fluorescence imaging. This capability paves the way for integrating nanodiamond-based quantum sensors into practical devices and systems, opening new possibilities for applications involving high-resolution thermal imaging and biosensing.

TI Implementable hybrid quantum ant colony optimization algorithm
SO QUANTUM MACHINE INTELLIGENCE
AB We propose a new hybrid quantum algorithm based on the classical Ant Colony Optimization algorithm to produce approximate solutions for NP-hard problems, in particular optimization problems. First, we discuss some previously proposed Quantum Ant Colony Optimization algorithms, and based on them, we develop an improved algorithm that can be truly implemented on near-term quantum computers. Our iterative algorithm codifies only the information about the pheromones and the exploration parameter in the quantum state, while subrogating the calculation of the numerical result to a classical computer. A new guided exploration strategy is used in order to take advantage of the quantum computation power and generate new possible solutions as a superposition of states. This approach is specially useful to solve constrained optimization problems, where we can implement efficiently the exploration of new paths without having to check the correspondence of a path to a solution before the measurement of the state. As an example of a NP-hard problem, we choose to solve the Quadratic Assignment Problem. The benchmarks made by simulating the noiseless quantum circuit and the experiments made on IBM quantum computers show the validity of the algorithm.

TI Predicting solid state material platforms for quantum technologies
SO NPJ COMPUTATIONAL MATERIALS
AB Semiconductor materials provide a compelling platform for quantum technologies (QT). However, identifying promising material hosts among the plethora of candidates is a major challenge. Therefore, we have developed a framework for the automated discovery of semiconductor platforms for QT using material informatics and machine learning methods. Different approaches were implemented to label data for training the supervised machine learning (ML) algorithms logistic regression, decision trees, random forests and gradient boosting. We find that an empirical approach relying exclusively on findings from the literature yields a clear separation between predicted suitable and unsuitable candidates. In contrast to expectations from the literature focusing on band gap and ionic character as important properties for QT compatibility, the ML methods highlight features related to symmetry and crystal structure, including bond length, orientation and radial distribution, as influential when predicting a material as suitable for QT.

TI Realistic Cost to Execute Practical Quantum Circuits using Direct
   Clifford+T Lattice Surgery Compilation
SO ACM TRANSACTIONS ON QUANTUM COMPUTING
AB We report a resource estimation pipeline that explicitly compiles quantum circuits expressed using the Clifford+T gate set into a surface code lattice surgery instruction set. The cadence of magic state requests from the compiled circuit enables the optimization of magic state distillation and storage requirements in a post-hoc analysis. To compile logical circuits into lattice surgery operations, we build upon the open-source Lattice Surgery Compiler. The revised compiler operates in two stages: the first translates logical gates into an abstract, layout-independent instruction set; the second compiles these into local lattice surgery instructions that are allocated to hardware tiles according to a specified resource layout. The second stage retains logical parallelism while avoiding resource contention in the fault-tolerant layer, aiding realism. Additionally, users can specify dedicated tiles at which magic states are replenished, enabling resource costs from the logical computation to be considered independently from magic state distillation and storage. We demonstrate the applicability of our pipeline to large practical quantum circuits by providing resource estimates for the ground state estimation of molecules. We find that variable magic state consumption rates in real circuits can cause the resource costs of magic state storage to dominate unless production is varied to suit.

TI Purification-based quantum error mitigation of pair-correlated electron
   simulations
SO NATURE PHYSICS
AB An important measure of the development of quantum computing platforms has been the simulation of increasingly complex physical systems. Before fault-tolerant quantum computing, robust error-mitigation strategies were necessary to continue this growth. Here, we validate recently introduced error-mitigation strategies that exploit the expectation that the ideal output of a quantum algorithm would be a pure state. We consider the task of simulating electron systems in the seniority-zero subspace where all electrons are paired with their opposite spin. This affords a computational stepping stone to a fully correlated model. We compare the performance of error mitigations on the basis of doubling quantum resources in time or in space on up to 20 qubits of a superconducting qubit quantum processor. We observe a reduction of error by one to two orders of magnitude below less sophisticated techniques such as postselection. We study how the gain from error mitigation scales with the system size and observe a polynomial suppression of error with increased resources. Extrapolation of our results indicates that substantial hardware improvements will be required for classically intractable variational chemistry simulations.

TI Persistency of tripartite nonlocality sharing with noise
SO ACTA PHYSICA SINICA
AB Recently, researchers have proven that an infinite number of Charlies and a pair of Alice and Bob can share standard tripartite nonlocality and genuinely nonsignal nonlocality by violating the Mermin and NS inequalities within tripartite systems. This discovery undoubtedly provides new perspectives and potential in quantum information science. However, it should be noted that the above-mentioned conclusion is derived on the highly idealized assumption that the quantum system is perfect and free from external disturbances. In reality, the realization of this ideal state is a challenging proposition. As a fundamental aspect of quantum mechanics, the phenomenon of quantum entanglement is susceptible to the influence of external factors, such as noise, during its practical implementation. Additionally, the process of quantum measurement can introduce potential errors, which may potentially diminish or even negate the observed quantum nonlocality. In light of the above situation, we investigate whether it is possible to share the corresponding quantum nonlocality, despite the inevitable occurrence of noise and error. This paper aims to study and discuss the persistency of nonlocality in noisy three-qubit systems. Firstly, the sufficient conditions are provided for Alice and Bob to share standard tripartite nonlocality with any number of Charlies, even when measurements are noisy and the initial three-qubit system is in a maximally entangled state with noise. This finding indicates that certain standard tripartite nonlocality can persist under non-ideal conditions as long as certain conditions are met. Moreover, this article elucidates the necessary conditions for multiple independent Charlies to share genuinely nonsignal nonlocality with a pair of Alice and Bob in a non-ideal state. This implies that despite the presence of noise and errors, this type of genuinely nonsignal nonlocality can still be securely shared among multiple parties as long as specific conditions are met. This research provides a new theoretical basis for the security and feasibility of quantum communication. The comprehensive analysis presented in this paper offers insights into the behavior of triple quantum nonlocality under noiseless conditions.

TI A Formulation of Structural Design Optimization Problems for Quantum
   Annealing
SO MATHEMATICS
AB We present a novel formulation of structural design optimization problems specifically tailored to be solved by qa. Structural design optimization aims to find the best, i.e., material-efficient yet high-performance, configuration of a structure. To this end, computational optimization strategies can be employed, where a recently evolving strategy based on quantum mechanical effects is qa. This approach requires the optimization problem to be present, e.g., as a qubo model. Thus, we develop a novel formulation of the optimization problem. The latter typically involves an analysis model for the component. Here, we use energy minimization principles that govern the behavior of structures under applied loads. This allows us to state the optimization problem as one overall minimization problem. Next, we map this to a qubo problem that can be immediately solved by qa. We validate the proposed approach using a size optimization problem of a compound rod under self-weight loading. To this end, we develop strategies to account for the limitations of currently available hardware. Remarkably, for small-scale problems, our approach showcases functionality on today's hardware such that this study can lay the groundwork for continued exploration of qa's impact on engineering design optimization problems.

TI Coupled vertical double quantum dots at single-hole occupancy
SO APPLIED PHYSICS LETTERS
AB Gate-defined quantum dots define an attractive platform for quantum computation and have been used to confine individual charges in a planar array. Here, we demonstrate control over vertical double quantum dots confined in a strained germanium double quantum well. We sense individual charge transitions with a single-hole transistor. The vertical separation between the quantum wells provides a sufficient difference in capacitive coupling to distinguish quantum dots located in the top and bottom quantum wells. Tuning the vertical double quantum dot to the (1,1) charge state confines a single-hole in each quantum well beneath a single plunger gate. By simultaneously accumulating holes under two neighboring plunger gates, we are able to tune to the (1,1,1,1) charge state. These results motivate quantum dot systems that exploit the third dimension, opening new opportunities for quantum simulation and quantum computing.

TI Rephasing spectral diffusion in time-bin spin-spin entanglement
   protocols
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Generating high-fidelity spin-spin entanglement is an essential task of quantum repeater networks for the distribution of quantum information across long distances. Solid-state-based spin-photon interfaces are promising candidates to realize nodes of a quantum network, but are often limited by spectral diffusion of the optical transition, which results in phase errors on the entangled states. Here, we introduce a method to correct phase errors from quasi-static frequency fluctuations after the entangled state is generated, by shelving the emitters in the excited state to refocus the unknown phase. For quasi-static frequency fluctuations, the fidelity is determined only by the lifetime of the excited state used for shelving, making it particularly suitable for systems with a long-lived shelving state with correlated spectral diffusion. Such a shelving state may be found in Kramers doublet systems such as rare-earth emitters and color centers in Si or SiC interfaced with nanophotonic cavities with a strongly frequency-dependent Purcell enhancement. The protocol can be used to generate high-fidelity entangled spin pairs without reducing the rate of entanglement generation.

TI Spectroscopic Measurements and Models of Energy Deposition in the
   Substrate of Quantum Circuits by Natural Ionizing Radiation
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB Naturally occurring background radiation is a potential source of correlated decoherence events in superconducting qubits that will challenge error-correction schemes. In order to characterize the radiation environment in an unshielded laboratory representative of superconducting qubits' environments, we performed broadband, spectroscopic measurements of background radiation events inside a millikelvin refrigerator. The spectrometer was designed to mimic the size and composition of a quantum circuit. Specifically, we measured the background radiation spectra in silicon substrates of two thicknesses, 500 and 1500 mu m, and one area, 25 mm(2). The observed spectra span energies from a few kilo-electron-volts up to nearly 10 MeV, are nearly featureless, and decrease in intensity by a factor of 40 000 between 100 keV and 3 MeV for the 500-mu m substrate. We integrate the spectra to obtain the average event rates and deposited power levels. These quantities correspond to a rate of 0.023 events per second and a power of 4.9 keV s(-1), when counting events that deposit at least 40 keV for the 500-mu m-thick substrate. We find that the cryogenic measurements are in good agreement with predictions based on simple measurements of the terrestrial gamma-ray flux outside the refrigerator, published models of cosmic-ray fluxes, a crude model of the cryostat, and radiation-transport simulations. This model requires no free parameters to predict the background radiation spectra in the silicon substrates. The agreement between measurements and predictions demonstrates that the model we present can be used to assess the relative contributions of terrestrial and cosmic-ray sources to background radiation interactions in silicon substrates of varying thickness. These spectroscopic measurements are performed with a novel combination of superconducting microresonators located on micromachined silicon islands that define the interaction volume with background radiation. The resonators transduce deposited energy to a readily detectable electrical signal. Microresonator readout closely resembles dispersive superconducting qubit readout, so similar devices-with or without micromachined islands-are suitable for integration with superconducting quantum circuits as detectors for background radiation events. For our specific laboratory conditions, we find that gamma-ray emissions from radioisotopes are responsible for the majority of events that deposit E <1 MeV. We present results demonstrating that the background radiation spectrum contains relevant contributions from cosmic-ray particles other than muons, particularly a tail of multi-mega-electron-volt events due to protons and neutrons. These observations suggest several paths to reducing the impact of background radiation on quantum circuits, supported by an empirically validated model for generating reliable predictions of radiation interactions with silicon substrates.

TI Imprints of screened dark energy on nonlocal quantum correlations
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW D
AB We investigate how screening mechanisms, reconciling light scalar fields driving cosmic acceleration with local fifth force constraints, can be probed via their impact on nonlocal quantum correlations between entangled spin pairs, whose evolution on a curved background is affected by general relativity (GR) and screened modified gravity effects. We consider a gedanken experiment featuring a pair of massive, spin-1/2 particles orbiting the Earth, evaluating their nonlocal correlations through spin observables associated to the Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt (CHSH) inequality. Using a general formalism developed earlier for curved spacetime spin evolution, we compute the effects of screening on the CHSH inequality, finding its degree of violation to be suppressed relative to the flat spacetime case. Applying this formalism to the chameleon, symmetron, and dilaton mechanisms, we identify currently unconstrained regions of parameter space where the screening contribution is comparable to that of GR.

TI Information diagrams in the study of entanglement in symmetric
   multi-quDit systems and applications to quantum phase transitions in
   Lipkin-Meshkov-Glick D-level atom models
SO QUANTUM INFORMATION PROCESSING
AB In this paper we pursue the use of information measures (in particular, information diagrams) for the study of entanglement in symmetric multi-quDit systems. We use generalizations to U( D) of spin U(2) coherent states and their adaptation to parity (multicomponent Schrodinger cats), and we analyse one- and two-quDit reduced density matrices. We use these correlation measures to characterize quantum phase transitions occurring in Lipkin-Meshkov-Glick models of D = 3-level identical atoms, and we propose the rank of the corresponding reduced density matrix as a discrete order parameter.

AB Verifiable Credentials (VCs) allow users to assert claims about themselves in a cryptographically-verifiable way. In last the few years, several different VC schemes have emerged, offering varying levels of privacy through different cryptographic techniques. Current VC implementations aim for security against attacks that use classical computers, but the cryptography in use is vulnerable to attacks if the full power of quantum computing is ever realised. Addressing this threat is important as VCs are gaining traction for applications with safety and security implications (e.g. the mobile Driver's License (mDL)). This work examines the cryptographic underpinnings of VCs to discuss quantum-safety, and makes recommendations regarding the next steps in the transition to post-quantum cryptography.

TI Equivariant quantum graph circuits: constructions for universal
   approximation over graphs
SO QUANTUM MACHINE INTELLIGENCE
AB We investigate quantum circuits for graph representation learning, and propose equivariant quantum graph circuits (EQGCs), as a class of parameterized quantum circuits with strong relational inductive bias for learning over graph-structured data. Conceptually, EQGCs serve as a unifying framework for quantum graph representation learning, allowing us to define several interesting subclasses subsuming existing proposals. In terms of the representation power, we prove that the subclasses of interest are universal approximators for functions over the bounded graph domain. This theoretical perspective on quantum graph machine learning methods opens many directions for further work, and could lead to models with capabilities beyond those of classical approaches. We also provide experimental evidence, and observe that the performance of EQGCs scales well with the depth of the model.

TI Quantum Advantage for Shared Randomness Generation
SO QUANTUM
AB Sharing correlated random variables is a resource for a number of information theoretic tasks such as privacy amplification, simultaneous message passing, secret sharing and many more. In this article, we show that to establish such a resource called shared randomness, quantum systems provide an advantage over their classical counterpart. Precisely, we show that appropriate albeit fixed measurements on a shared two-qubit state can generate correlations which cannot be obtained from any possible state on two classical bits. In a resource theoretic set-up, this feature of quantum systems can be interpreted as an advantage in winning a two players co-operative game, which we call the 'non-monopolize social subsidy' game. It turns out that the quantum states leading to the desired advantage must possess non-classicality in the form of quantum discord. On the other hand, while distributing such sources of shared randomness between two parties via noisy channels, quantum channels with zero capacity as well as with classical capacity strictly less than unity perform more efficiently than the perfect classical channel. Protocols presented here are noiserobust and hence should be realizable with state-of-the-art quantum devices.

TI A Resource-Virtualized and Hardware-Aware Quantum Compilation Framework
   for Real Quantum Computing Processors
SO RESEARCH
AB As quantum computing systems continue to scale up and become more clustered, efficiently compiling user quantum programs into high-fidelity executable sequences on real hardware remains a key challenge for current quantum compilation systems. In this study, we introduce a system-software framework that integrates resource virtualization and hardware-aware compilation for real quantum computing processors, termed QSteed. QSteed virtualizes quantum processors through a 4-layer abstraction hierarchy comprising the real quantum processing unit (QPU), standard QPU (StdQPU), substructure of the QPU (SubQPU), and virtual QPU (VQPU). These abstractions, together with calibration data, device topology, and noise descriptors, are maintained in a dedicated database to enable unified and fine-grained management across superconducting quantum platforms. At run time, the modular compiler queries the database to match each incoming circuit with the most suitable VQPU, after which it confines layout, routing, gate resynthesis, and noise-adaptive optimizations to that virtual subregion. The complete stack has been deployed on the Quafu superconducting cluster, where experimental runs confirm the correctness of the virtualization model and the efficacy of the compiler without requiring modifications to user code. By integrating resource virtualization with a select-then-compile workflow, QSteed demonstrates a robust architecture for compiling programs on noisy superconducting processors. This architectural approach offers a promising path toward efficient compilation needs across various superconducting quantum computing platforms in the noisy intermediate-scale quantum era.

TI Incomplete quantum oblivious transfer with perfect one-sided security
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Oblivious transfer is a fundamental cryptographic primitive that is useful for secure multiparty computation. There are several variants of oblivious transfer. We consider 1-out-of-2 oblivious transfer, where a sender sends two bits of information to a receiver. The receiver receives only one of the two bits, while the sender does not know which bit the receiver has received. Perfect quantum oblivious transfer with information-theoretic security is known to be impossible. We aim to find the lowest possible cheating probabilities. Bounds on cheating probabilities have been investigated for "complete" protocols, where if both parties follow the protocol, the bit value obtained by the receiver matches the sender's bit value. We instead investigate incomplete protocols, where the receiver obtains an incorrect bit value with probability pf. We present optimal noninteractive protocols where Alice's bit values are encoded in four symmetric pure quantum states, and where she cannot cheat better than with a random guess. We find the protocols such that for a given pf , Bob's cheating probability pr is as low as possible, and vice versa. Furthermore, we show that noninteractive quantum protocols can outperform noninteractive classical protocols and give a lower bound on Bob's cheating probability in interactive quantum protocols. Importantly for optical implementations, our protocols do not require entanglement nor quantum memory.

TI Non-isolated sources of electromagnetic radiation by multipole
   decomposition for photonic quantum technologies on a chip with nanoscale
   apertures
SO NANOSCALE ADVANCES
AB The creation of single photon sources on a chip is a mid-term milestone on the road to chip-scale quantum computing. An in-depth understanding of the extended multipole decomposition of non-isolated sources of electromagnetic radiation is not only relevant for a microscopic description of fundamental phenomena, such as light propagation in a medium, but also for emerging applications such as single-photon sources. To design single photon emitters on a chip, we consider a ridge dielectric waveguide perturbed with a cylindrical inclusion. For this, we expanded classical multipole decomposition that allows simplifying and interpreting complex optical interactions in an intuitive manner to make it suitable for analyzing light-matter interactions with non-isolated objects that are parts of a larger network, e.g. individual components such as a single photon source of an optical chip. It is shown that our formalism can be used to design single photon sources on a chip.

TI Quantum Steganography Based on the B92 Quantum Protocol
SO MATHEMATICS
AB This paper presents a communication algorithm in which a grayscale image, shared between two parties, can be used to transmit a secret message, by applying the idea introduced in the B92 quantum protocol. The least significant qubits of the pixels' representation in certain regions of the image are used. With the help of a server, the algorithm generates a random message, which can further act as a secret key for cryptographic algorithms in order to secure the data that two parties might want to exchange later on. The chosen representation of the image is NEQR (novel enhanced quantum representation) and the platform used for testing the described idea is IBM Quantum Experience, along with the open-source Python framework called Qiskit. This solution allows users to design, implement quantum circuits (containing various quantum gates), and simulate them using real devices and local simulators. An implementation using this platform for a sample image and the corresponding results are also presented in this paper.

TI Exact gravity duals for simple quantum circuits
SO SCIPOST PHYSICS
AB Holographic complexity proposals have sparked interest in quantifying the cost of state preparation in quantum field theories and its possible dual gravitational manifestations. The most basic ingredient in defining complexity is the notion of a class of circuits that, when acting on a given reference state, all produce a desired target state. In the present work we build on studies of circuits performing local conformal transformations in general two-dimensional conformal field theories and construct the exact gravity dual to such circuits. In our approach to holographic complexity, the gravity dual to the optimal circuit is the one that minimizes an externally chosen cost assigned to each circuit. Our results provide a basis for studying exact gravity duals to circuit costs from first principles.

TI Experimental High-Dimensional Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger Entanglement
   with Superconducting Transmon Qutrits
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW APPLIED
AB Multipartite entanglement is one of the core concepts in quantum information science with broad applications that span from condensed matter physics to quantum physics foundation tests. Although its most studied and tested forms encompass two-dimensional systems, current quantum platforms technically allow the manipulation of additional quantum levels. We report the experimental demonstration and certification of a high-dimensional multipartite entangled state in a superconducting quantum processor. We generate the three-qutrit Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger state by designing the necessary pulses to perform high-dimensional quantum operations. We obtain the fidelity of 76% +/- 1%, proving the generation of a genuine three-partite and three-dimensional entangled state. To this date, only photonic devices have been able to create and certify the entanglement of these high-dimensional states. Our work demonstrates that another platform, superconducting systems, is ready to exploit genuine high-dimensional entanglement and that a programmable quantum device accessed on the cloud can be used to design and execute experiments beyond binary quantum computation.

TI Error suppression in multicomponent cat codes with photon subtraction
   and teleamplification
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB It is known that multiphoton states can be protected from decoherence due to a passive loss channel by applying noiseless attenuation before and noiseless amplification after the channel. In this work, we propose the combined use of multiphoton subtraction on four -component cat codes and teleamplification to effectively suppress errors under detection and environmental losses. The back -action from multiphoton subtraction modifies the encoded qubit encoded on cat states by suppressing the higher photon numbers, while simultaneously ensuring that the original qubit can be recovered effectively through teleamplification followed by error correction, thus preserving its quantum information. With realistic photon subtraction and teleamplification-based scheme followed by optimal error -correcting maps, one can achieve a worst -case fidelity (over all encoded pure states) of over 93.5% (82% with only noisy teleamplification) at a minimum success probability of about 3.42%, under a 10% environmental -loss rate, 95% detector efficiency and sufficiently large cat states with the coherent -state amplitudes of 2. This sets a promising standard for combating large passive losses in quantum -information tasks in the noisy intermediate -scale quantum (NISQ) era, such as direct quantum communication or the storage of encoded qubits on the photonic platform.

TI Post-processing optimization for continuous-variable quantum key
   distribution
SO THEORETICAL COMPUTER SCIENCE
AB The performance of a continuous-variable quantum key distribution (CVQKD) protocol depends on the efficiency of the post-processing of measurement results. The post processing methods extract statistical information from the raw data, establish the mutual knowledge between the parties, and produce a final key that provides absolute security. The post-processing phase is a bottleneck in CVQKD with crucial importance to the efficiency and protocol attributes. Post-processing uses the raw data of the parties generated by the quantum-level transmission and a classical authenticated channel to generate a secret key between the parties. The current reconciliation procedures require high-complexity coding with moderate resulting efficiency. Here we define an optimization method for post-processing in continuous-variable quantum key distribution. The reconciliation method achieves additive Gaussian noise on the random secret for arbitrarily low dimensional blocks. The model consumes all information from the raw data blocks to provide maximal efficiency and security via standard operations. The results can be realized by generic Gaussian coding schemes, allowing an easily implementation for experimental CVQKD protocols. (c) 2021 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier B.V.

TI Application of quantum approximate optimization algorithm to mission
   planning of command and control organization
SO ACTA PHYSICA SINICA
AB The mission planning problem in command and control organization can be mapped into a combinatorial optimization problem with many variables and is difficult to solve. The traditional heuristic list planning method faces the problems of high time complexity and poor real-time response. For the mission planning problem in command and control organization, a quantum circuit solution scheme is proposed based on quantum approximate optimization algorithm in this work. Firstly, the mission planning problem is transformed into a typical combinatorial optimization problem, the exact coverage problem. Then, by constructing the corresponding mathematical model, the final state Hamiltonian expression of the quantum approximate optimization algorithm for the exact coverage problem is derived. The quantum circuit based on the quantum approximate optimization algorithm is designed. Finally the parameters in the quantum logic gate are optimized by the momentum gradient descent algorithm, and the simulation experiment is carried out by using the quantum software development environment of the Origin Quantum Computing Company. The simulation results show that the quantum circuit scheme can be used to solve the mission planning problem, reduce the time complexity of the algorithm, and improve the resource utilization to a certain extent. This work lays the foundation for further application of quantum algorithm to solving the mission planning problem in command and control organization.

TI Parametric magnon transduction to spin qubits
SO SCIENCE ADVANCES
AB The integration of heterogeneous modular units for building large-scale quantum networks requires engineering mechanisms that allow suitable transduction of quantum information. Magnon-based transducers are especially attractive due to their wide range of interactions and rich nonlinear dynamics, but most of the work to date has focused on linear magnon transduction in the traditional system composed of yttrium iron garnet and diamond, two materials with difficult integrability into wafer-scale quantum circuits. In this work, we present a different approach by using wafer-compatible materials to engineer a hybrid transducer that exploits magnon nonlinearities in a magnetic microdisc to address quantum spin defects in silicon carbide. The resulting interaction scheme points to the unique transduction behavior that can be obtained when complementing quantum systems with nonlinear magnonics.

TI In Situ Tunable Interaction with an Invertible Sign
   between a Fluxonium and a Post Cavity
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB Quantum computation with bosonic modes presents a powerful paradigm for harnessing the principles of quantum mechanics to perform complex information processing tasks. In constructing a bosonic qubit with superconducting circuits, nonlinearity is typically introduced to a cavity mode through an ancillary two-level qubit. However, the spurious heating of the ancilla has impeded progress toward fully faulttolerant bosonic qubits. The ability to in situ decouple the ancilla when not in use would be beneficial but has so far only been realized with tunable couplers or additional parametric drives. This work presents a novel architecture for quantum information processing, comprising a three-dimensional post cavity coupled to a fluxonium ancilla via a readout resonator. The intricate energy-level structure of this system results in a complex landscape of interactions, the sign of which can be tuned in situ by the magnetic field threading the fluxonium loop without the need for additional elements. Our results could significantly advance the lifetime and controllability of bosonic qubits.

TI Measurement-induced quantum walks on an IBM quantum computer
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB We study a quantum walk of a single particle that is subject to stroboscopic projective measurements on a graph with two sites. This two-level system is the minimal model of a measurement-induced quantum walk. The mean first detected transition and return time are computed on an IBM quantum computer as a function of the hopping matrix element between the sites and the on-site potential. The experimentally monitored quantum walk reveals the theoretically predicted behavior, such as the quantization of the first detected return time and the strong increase of the mean first detected transition time near degenerate points, with high accuracy.

TI Combinatorial optimization with quantum computers
SO ENGINEERING OPTIMIZATION
AB Quantum computers leverage the principles of quantum mechanics to do computation with a potential advantage over classical computers. Though a single classical computer transforms one particular binary input into an output after applying one operator to the input, a quantum computer can apply the operator to a superposition of binary strings to provide a superposition of binary outputs, performing computations apparently in parallel. This feature allows quantum computers to speed up the computation compared to classical algorithms. Unsurprisingly, quantum algorithms have been proposed to solve optimization problems in quantum computers. Furthermore, a family of quantum machines called quantum annealers is specially designed to solve optimization problems. This article provides an introduction to quantum optimization from a practical point of view. It introduces the reader to the use of quantum annealers and quantum gate-based machines to solve optimization problems.

TI Single-shot error mitigation by coherent Pauli checks
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Generating samples from the output distribution of a quantum circuit is a ubiquitous task used as a building block of many quantum algorithms. Here we show how to accomplish this task on a noisy quantum processor lacking full-blown error correction for a special class of quantum circuits dominated by Clifford gates. Our approach is based on coherent Pauli checks (CPCs) that detect errors in a Clifford circuit by verifying commutation rules between random Pauli-type check operators and the considered circuit. Our main contributions are as follows. First, we derive a simple formula for the probability that a Clifford circuit protected by CPCs contains a logical error. In the limit of a large number of checks, the logical error probability is shown to approach the value approximate to 7 epsilon n/5, where n is the number of qubits and e is the depolarizing error rate. Our formula agrees nearly perfectly with the numerical simulation results. Second, we show that CPCs are well suited for quantum processors with a limited qubit connectivity. For example, the difference between all-to-all and linear qubit connectivity is only a 3x increase in the number of CNOT gates required to implement CPCs. Third, we describe simplified one-sided CPCs, which are well suited for mitigating measurement errors in the single-shot settings. Finally, we report an experimental demonstration of CPCs with up to 10 logical qubits and more than 100 logical CNOT gates. Our experimental results show that CPCs provide a marked improvement in the logical error probability for the considered task of sampling the output distribution of quantum circuits.

TI Quantum Key Distribution Networks - Key Management: A Survey
SO ACM COMPUTING SURVEYS
AB Secure communication makes the widespread use of telecommunication networks and services possible. With the constant progress of computing and mathematics, new cryptographic methods are being diligently developed. Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) is a promising technology that provides an Information-Theoretically Secure (ITS) solution to the secret-key agreement problem between two remote parties. QKD networks based on trusted relay nodes are built to provide service to a larger number of parties at arbitrary distances. They function as an add-on technology to traditional networks, generating, managing, distributing, and supplying ITS cryptographic keys. Since key resources are limited, integrating QKD network services into critical infrastructures necessitates effective key management. As a result, this article provides a comprehensive review of key management approaches for trusted-relay QKD networks. They are analyzed to facilitate the identification of potential strategies and accelerate the future development of QKD networks.

TI Maximally entangled and gigahertz-clocked on-demand photon pair source
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
AB We present a 1 GHz-clocked, maximally entangled and on-demand photon pair source based on droplet etched GaAs quantum dots using two-photon excitation. By employing these GaP microlens-enhanced devices in conjunction with their substantial brightness, raw entanglement fidelities of up to 0.95 +/- 0.01 and postselected photon indistinguishabilities of up to 0.93 +/- 0.01, the suitability for quantum repeater based long range quantum entanglement distribution schemes is shown. Comprehensive investigations of a complete set of polarization selective two-photon correlations facilitate an innovative method to determine the extraction and excitation efficiencies directly, as opposed to commonly employed indirect techniques. Additionally, time-resolved analysis of Hong-Ou-Mandel interference traces reveal an alternative approach to the investigation of pure photon dephasing.

However, real-world applications of quantum computing for nuclear theory often generate deep quantum circuits that place demanding memory and processing requirements on conventional simulation methods. Here, we present advances in high-performance numerical simulations of deep quantum circuits to efficiently verify the accuracy of low-energy nuclear physics applications. Our approach employs novel methods for accelerating the numerical simulation including management of simulated mid-circuit measurements to verify projection based state preparation circuits. We test these methods across a variety of high-performance computing systems and our results show that circuits up to 21 qubits and more than 115,000,000 gates can be efficiently simulated.

TI Additive manufacturing of functionalised atomic vapour cells for
   next-generation quantum technologies
SO QUANTUM SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB Atomic vapour cells are an indispensable tool for quantum technologies (QT), but potential improvements are limited by the capacities of conventional manufacturing techniques. Using an additive manufacturing (AM) technique-vat polymerisation by digital light processing-we demonstrate, for the first time, a 3D-printed glass vapour cell. The exploitation of AM capacities allows intricate internal architectures, overprinting of 2D optoelectronical materials to create integrated sensors and surface functionalisation, while also showing the ability to tailor the optical properties of the AM glass by in-situ growth of gold nanoparticles. The produced cells achieve ultra-high vacuum of 2 x 10(-9) mbar and enable Doppler-free spectroscopy; we demonstrate laser frequency stabilisation as a QT application. These results highlight the transformative role that AM can play for QT in enabling compact, optimised and integrated multi-material components and devices.

TI Enhanced Plasmonic Trapping and Fluorescent Emission of Nitrogen-Vacancy
   Nanodiamonds Using a High-Efficiency Nanofocusing Device
SO NANO LETTERS
AB Fluorescent nanodiamonds (FNDs) with nitrogen-vacancy centers are pivotal for advancing quantum photonics and imaging through deterministic quantum state manipulation. However, deterministic integration of quantum emitters into photonic devices remains a challenge due to the need for high coupling efficiency and Purcell enhancement. We report a deterministic FND-integrated nanofocusing device achieved by assembling FNDs at a plasmonic waveguide tip through plasmonic-enhanced optical trapping. This technique not only increases the emission rate by 58.6 times compared to isolated FNDs but also preferentially directs radiation into the waveguide at a rate 5.3 times higher than that into free space, achieving an exceptional figure-of-merit of similar to 3000 for efficient energy transfer. Our findings represent a significant step toward deterministic integration in quantum imaging and communication, opening new avenues for quantum technology advancements.

TI Quantum Fuzzy Inference Engine for Particle Accelerator Control
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON QUANTUM ENGINEERING
AB Recently, quantum computing has been proven as an ideal theory for the design of fuzzy inference engines, thanks to its capability to efficiently solve the rule explosion problem. In this scenario, a quantum fuzzy inference engine (QFIE) was proposed as a quantum algorithm able to generate an exponential computational advantage over conventional fuzzy inference engines. However, there are no practical demonstrations that the QFIE can be used to efficiently manage complex systems. This article bridges this gap by using, for the very first time, the QFIE to control critical systems such as those related to particle accelerator facilities at the European Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN). As demonstrated by a series of experiments performed at the T4 target station of the CERN Super Proton Synchrotron fixed-target physics beamline and at the Advanced Proton Driven Plasma Wakefield Acceleration Experiment, the QFIE is able to efficiently control such an environment, paving the way for the use of fuzzy-enabled quantum computers in real-world applications.

SO NEURAL NETWORKS
AB Quantum computing models have propelled advances in many application domains. However, in the field of natural language processing (NLP), quantum computing models are limited in representation capacity due to the high linearity of the underlying quantum computing architecture. This work attempts to address this limitation by leveraging the concept of self-supervised pre-training, a paradigm that has been propelling the rocketing development of NLP, to increase the power of quantum NLP models on the representation level. Specifically, we present a self-supervised pre-training approach to train quantum encodings of sentences, and fine-tune quantum circuits for downstream tasks on its basis. Experiments show that pre-trained mechanism brings remarkable improvement over end-to-end pure quantum models, yielding meaningful prediction results on a variety of downstream text classification datasets.

We introduce random errors into the scheme by imposing the Poisson noise on the measured photon counts. The precision of state estimation is quantified and presented on graphs. As a special case, we compare the efficiency of the framework for the pure three-qubit generalized Werner state and the W state. The reconstructed states are presented graphically and discussed.

We give a holographic boundary description of this process in terms of the overlap of two growing perturbations in a shared quantum circuit. The perturbations grow both exponentially as well as ballistically. Due to a competition between different physical effects, the circuit analysis shows dependence on the transverse locations and exhibits four regimes of qualitatively different behaviors. On the gravity side we study properties of the postcollision geometry, using exact calculations in simple setups and estimations in more general circumstances. We show that the circuit analysis offers intuitive and surprisingly accurate predictions about gravity computations involving non-linear features of general relativity.

TI Fast elementary gates for universal quantum computation with Kerr
   parametric oscillator qubits
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Kerr parametric oscillators (KPOs) can stabilize the superpositions of coherent states, which can be utilized as qubits, and are promising candidates for realizing hardware-efficient quantum computers. Although elementary gates for universal quantum computation with KPO qubits have been proposed, these gates are usually based on adiabatic operations and thus need long gate times, which result in errors caused by photon loss in KPOs realized by, e.g., superconducting circuits. In this work we accelerate the elementary gates by experimentally feasible control methods, which are based on numerical optimization of pulse shapes for shortcuts to adiabaticity. By numerical simulations, we show that the proposed methods can achieve speedups compared to adiabatic ones by up to six times with high gate fidelities of 99.9%. These methods are thus expected to be useful for quantum computers with KPOs.

SO NPJ QUANTUM INFORMATION
AB Despite tremendous theoretical and experimental progress in continuous variable (CV) quantum key distribution (QKD), the security has not been rigorously established for most current continuous variable quantum key distribution systems that have imperfections. Among these imperfections, intensity fluctuation is one of the principal problems affecting security. In this paper, we provide simple security proofs for continuous variable quantum key distribution systems with intensity fluctuating sources. Specifically, depending on device assumptions in the source, the imperfect systems are divided into two general cases for security proofs. In the most conservative case, we prove the security based on the tagging idea, which is a main technique for the security proof of discrete variable quantum key distribution. Our proofs are simple to implement without any hardware adjustment for current continuous variable quantum key distribution systems. Also, we show that our proofs are able to provide secure secret keys in the finite-size scenario.

Integrating solid-state light sources on a photonic chip provides a means of creating scalable on-chip quantum networks with sophisticated optoelectronic circuitry. Extending beyond single emitters to multi-emitter systems is a frontier that offers substantial opportunities for fundamental scientific advances as well as applications that require multi-emitter quantum states. A key challenge in this endeavor is the spectral inhomogeneity of solid-state emitters, which results in non-identical emitters that cannot be interfaced with one another. This review describes recent advances in tailoring the emission properties of individual emitters and the multi-emitter demonstrations that are enabled by this control for a variety of prominent materials, as well as prospects for further development.

TI Maximum-confidence measurement for qubit states
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB In quantum state discrimination, one aims to identify unknown states from a given ensemble by performing measurements. Different strategies such as minimum-error discrimination or unambiguous state identification find different optimal measurements. Maximum-confidence measurements (MCMs) maximize the confidence with which inputs can be identified given the measurement outcomes. This unifies a range of discrimination strategies including minimum-error and unambiguous state identification, which can be understood as limiting cases of MCM. In this work we investigate MCMs for general ensembles of qubit states. We present a method for finding MCMs for qubit-state ensembles by exploiting their geometry and apply it to several interesting cases, including ensembles of two and four mixed states and ensembles of an arbitrary number of pure states. We also compare MCMs to minimum-error and unambiguous discrimination for qubits. Our results provide interpretations of various qubit measurements in terms of MCM and can be used to devise qubit protocols.

TI Learning Temporal Quantum Tomography
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB Quantifying and verifying the control level in preparing a quantum state are central challenges in building quantum devices. The quantum state is characterized from experimental measurements, using a procedure known as tomography, which requires a vast number of resources. However, tomography for a quantum device with temporal processing, which is fundamentally different from standard tomography, has not been formulated. We develop a practical and approximate tomography method using a recurrent machine learning framework for this intriguing situation. The method is based on repeated quantum interactions between a system called quantum reservoir with a stream of quantum states. Measurement data from the reservoir are connected to a linear readout to train a recurrent relation between quantum channels applied to the input stream. We demonstrate our algorithms for representative quantum learning tasks, followed by the proposal of a quantum memory capacity to evaluate the temporal processing ability of nearterm quantum devices.

TI Variational quantum optimization with multibasis encodings
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Despite extensive research efforts, few quantum algorithms for classical optimization demonstrate a realizable quantum advantage. The utility of many quantum algorithms is limited by high requisite circuit depth and nonconvex optimization landscapes. We tackle these challenges by introducing a variational quantum algorithm that benefits from two innovations: multibasis graph encodings using single-qubit expectation values and nonlinear activation functions. Our technique results in increased observed optimization performance and a factor-of-two reduction in requisite qubits. While the classical simulation of many qubits with traditional quantum formalism is impossible due to its exponential scaling, we mitigate this limitation with exact circuit representations using factorized tensor rings. In particular, the shallow circuits permitted by our technique, combined with efficient factorized tensor-based simulation, enable us to successfully optimize the MaxCut of the 512-vertex DIMACS library graphs on a single GPU. By improving the performance of quantum optimization algorithms while requiring fewer quantum resources and utilizing shallower, more error-resistant circuits, we offer tangible progress for variational quantum optimization.

TI Experimentally optimizing QKD rates via nonlocal dispersion compensation
SO QUANTUM SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB Quantum key distribution (QKD) enables unconditionally secure communication guaranteed by the laws of physics. The last decades have seen tremendous efforts in making this technology feasible under real-life conditions, with implementations bridging ever longer distances and creating ever higher secure key rates. Readily deployed glass fiber connections are a natural choice for distributing the single photons necessary for QKD both in intra- and intercity links. Any fiber-based implementation however experiences chromatic dispersion which deteriorates temporal detection precision. This ultimately limits maximum distance and achievable key rate of such QKD systems. In this work, we address this limitation to both maximum distance and key rate and present an effective and easy-to-implement method to overcome chromatic dispersion effects. By exploiting entangled photons' frequency correlations, we make use of nonlocal dispersion compensation to improve the photons' temporal correlations. Our experiment is the first implementation utilizing the inherently quantum-mechanical effect of nonlocal dispersion compensation for QKD in this way. We experimentally show an increase in key rate from 6.1 to 228.3 bits/s over 6.46 km of telecom fiber. Our approach is extendable to arbitrary fiber lengths and dispersion values, resulting in substantially increased key rates and even enabling QKD in the first place where strong dispersion would otherwise frustrate key extraction at all.

TI Parity-spin superconducting qubit based on topological insulators
SO NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB We propose to utilize two parity-protected qubits which are built based on superconductor/topological-insulator/superconductor (SC/TI/SC) Josephson junction to implement a parity-spin superconducting qubit. The SC/TI/SC Josephson junctions have identical Josephson potential, which is robust against fabrication variations and guarantees the reliable cos 2 phi energy-phase relation for implementing a parity-protected qubit. By viewing the even and odd parity ground states of a single parity-protected qubit as spin-1/2 states, we construct the logic qubit states using the total parity odd subspace of two parity-protected qubits, refereed to parity-spin qubit. This parity-spin qubit exhibits robustness against charge noise, similar to a singlet-triplet (S-T) qubit's immunity to global magnetic field fluctuations. Meanwhile, the flux noise cannot directly couple two states with the same total parity and is significantly suppressed. Benefiting from the simultaneous protection from charge and flux noise, we demonstrate an enhancement of both T-1 and T-2 coherence times. Our work presents a TI-based approach to engineer symmetry-protected superconducting qubits.
