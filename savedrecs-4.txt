TI Communication Over Quantum Channels With Parameter Estimation
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INFORMATION THEORY
AB Communication over a random-parameter quantum channel when the decoder is required to reconstruct the parameter sequence is considered. We study scenarios that include either strictly-causal, causal, or non-causal channel side information (CSI) available at the encoder, and also when CSI is not available. This model can be viewed as a form of quantum metrology, and as the quantum counterpart of the classical rate-and-state channel with state estimation at the decoder. Regularized formulas for the capacity-distortion regions are derived. In the special case of measurement channels, single-letter characterizations are derived for the strictly-causal and causal settings. Furthermore, in the more general case of entanglement-breaking channels, a single-letter characterization is derived when CSI is not available. As a consequence, we obtain regularized formulas for the capacity of random-parameter quantum channels with CSI, generalizing previous results by Boche et al., 2016, on classical-quantum channels. Bosonic dirty paper coding is introduced as a consequence, where we demonstrate that the optimal coefficient is not necessarily that of minimum mean-square error estimation as in the classical setting.

TI A novel dynamic image watermarking technique with features inspired by
   quantum computing principles
SO AIP ADVANCES
AB This research proposes a novel dynamic image watermarking technique with features inspired by quantum computing principles. This method encodes binary values into qubits and embeds a watermark into an original image. The watermarking process is achieved by utilizing quantum circuits to manipulate the qubits representing the pixel values of the original and watermark images. To extract the watermark, encode each pixel value into a qubit, combine them using quantum operations, and then measure the resultant quantum state. This technique ensures the integrity and authenticity of the image by embedding a watermark that can be extracted with high fidelity. Simulation results show that our technique successfully embeds watermarks while maintaining picture quality. Moreover, this method exhibits robustness against common image processing attacks, highlighting its potential for secure image verification applications.

AB This work proposes a digital quantum simulation protocol for the linear scattering process of bosons, which provides a simple extension to partially distinguishable boson cases. Our protocol is achieved by combining the boson-fermion correspondence relation and fermion to qubit encoding protocols. As a proof of concept, we designed quantum circuits for generating the Hong-Ou-Mandel dip by varying particle distinguishability. The circuits were verified with the classical and quantum simulations using the IBM Quantum and IonQ cloud services.

TI Quantum Electrodynamics of Intense Laser-Matter Interactions: A Tool for
   Quantum State Engineering
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB Intense laser-matter interactions are at the center of interest in research and technology since the development of high-power lasers. They have been widely used for fundamental studies in atomic, molecular, and optical physics, and they are at the core of attosecond physics and ultrafast optoelectronics. Although the majority of these studies have been successfully described using classical electromagnetic fields, recent investigations based on fully quantized approaches have shown that intense laser-atom interactions can be used for the generation of controllable high-photon-number entangled coherent states and coherent state superpositions. In this tutorial, we provide a comprehensive fully quantized description of intense laseratom interactions. We elaborate on the processes of high-harmonic generation, above-threshold ionization, and we discuss new phenomena that cannot be revealed within the context of semiclassical theories. We provide the description for conditioning the light field on different electronic processes, and their consequences for quantum state engineering of light. Finally, we discuss the extension of the approach to more complex materials, and the impact to quantum technologies for a new photonic platform composed of the symbiosis of attosecond physics and quantum information science.

TI Witnessing Entanglement and Quantum Correlations in Condensed Matter: A
   Review
SO ADVANCED QUANTUM TECHNOLOGIES
AB The detection and certification of entanglement and quantum correlations in materials is of fundamental and far-reaching importance, and has seen significant recent progress. It impacts both the understanding of the basic science of quantum many-body phenomena as well as the identification of systems suitable for novel technologies. Frameworks suitable to condensed matter that connect measurements to entanglement and coherence have been developed in the context of quantum information theory. These take the form of entanglement witnesses and quantum correlation measures.The underlying theory of these quantities, their relation to condensed matter experimental techniques, and their application to real materials are comprehensively reviewed. In addition, their usage in, e.g., protocols, the relative advantages and disadvantages of witnesses and measures, and future prospects in, e.g., correlated electrons, entanglement dynamics, and entangled spectroscopic probes, are presented. Consideration is given to the interdisciplinary nature of this emerging research and substantial ongoing progress by providing an accessible and practical treatment from fundamentals to application. Particular emphasis is placed on quantities accessible to collective measurements, including by susceptibility and spectroscopic techniques. This includes the magnetic susceptibility witness, one-tangle, concurrence and two-tangle, two-site quantum discord, and quantum coherence measures such as the quantum Fisher information.

TI Nonlinear integrated quantum photonics with AlGaAs
SO OPTICA
AB Integrated photonics provides a powerful approach for developing compact, stable, and scalable architectures for the generation, manipulation, and detection of quantum states of light. To this end, several material platforms are being developed in parallel, each providing its specific assets, and hybridization techniques to combine their strengths are available. This review focuses on AlGaAs, a III-V semiconductor platform combining a mature fabrication technology, direct band-gap compliant with electrical injection, low-loss operation, large electro-optic effect, and compatibility with superconducting detectors for on-chip detection. We detail recent implementations of room-temperature sources of quantum light based on the high second-and third-order optical nonlinearities of the material, as well as photonic circuits embedding various functionalities ranging from polarizing beamsplitters to Mach-Zehnder interferometers, modulators, and tunable filters. We then present several realizations of quantum state engineering enabled by these recent advances and discuss open perspectives and remaining challenges in the field of integrated quantum photonics with AlGaAs.

TI Bases for optimising stabiliser decompositions of quantum states
SO QUANTUM SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB Stabiliser states play a central role in the theory of quantum computation. For example, they are used to encode computational basis states in the most common quantum error correction schemes. Arbitrary quantum states admit many stabiliser decompositions: ways of being expressed as a superposition of stabiliser states. Understanding the structure of stabiliser decompositions has significant applications in verifying and simulating near-term quantum computers. We introduce and study the vector space of linear dependencies of n-qubit stabiliser states. These spaces have canonical bases containing vectors whose size grows exponentially in n. We construct elegant bases of linear dependencies of constant size three. Critically, our sparse bases can be computed without first compiling a dictionary of all n-qubit stabiliser states. We utilise them to explicitly compute the stabiliser extent of states of more qubits than is feasible with existing techniques. Finally, we delineate future applications to improving theoretical bounds on the stabiliser rank of magic states.

TI Anonymous and secret communication in quantum networks
SO NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB Secure communication is one of the key applications of quantum networks. In recent years, following the demands for identity protection in classical communication protocols, the need for anonymity has also emerged for quantum networks. Here, we demonstrate that quantum physics allows parties-besides communicating securely over a network-to also keep their identities secret. We implement such an anonymous quantum conference key agreement by sharing multipartite entangled states in a quantum network. We demonstrate the protocol with four parties and establish keys in subsets of the network-different combinations of two and three parties-whilst keeping the participating parties anonymous. We additionally show that the protocol is verifiable and run multiple key generation and verification routines. Our work thus addresses one of the key challenges of networked communication: keeping the identities of the communicating parties private.

TI Distributing circuits over heterogeneous, modular quantum computing
   network architectures
SO QUANTUM SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB We consider a heterogeneous network of quantum computing modules, sparsely connected via Bell states. Operations across these connections constitute a computational bottleneck and they are likely to add more noise to the computation than operations performed within a module. We introduce several techniques for transforming a given quantum circuit into one implementable on such a network, minimising the number of Bell states required to do so. We extend previous works on circuit distribution to the case of heterogeneous networks. On the one hand, we extend the hypergraph approach of Andres-Martinez and Heunen (2019 Phys. Rev. A 100 032308) to arbitrary network topologies, and we propose the use of Steiner trees to detect and reuse common connections, further reducing the cost of entanglement sharing within the network. On the other hand, we extend the embedding techniques of Wu et al (2023 Quantum 7 1196) to networks with more than two modules. We show that, with careful manipulation of trade-offs, these two new approaches can be combined into a single automated framework. Our proposal is implemented and benchmarked; the results confirm that our contributions make noticeable improvements upon the aforementioned works and complement their weaknesses.

TI Systematical study of effects of chip parameters and control waveforms
   on fidelity of CZ gate
SO ACTA PHYSICA SINICA
AB Efficient and high-fidelity two-qubit gates are crucial to achieving fault-tolerant quantum computing and have become one of the key research topics in the quantum computing field. The fidelity of quantum gate is affected by many factors, such as quantum chip parameters and control waveforms. In theory, the chip paramters and waveforms can be precisely designed. However, in practice, the actual chip parameters and waveforms may deviate from the theoretical values. It is necessary to systematically study the effects of chip parameters, control waveforms, and other factors on the fidelity of two-qubit gate, and determine the magnitude and direction of the each factor's effect. Here, we systematically study the effects of chip parameters, control waveforms, coupler start frequency, qubit frequency, etc. on the fidelity of CZ gate. On this basis, the response of gate fidelity to deviations in control parameters is further studied. At the chip design level, quantum chips based on CBQ parameters can achieve higher-fidelity CZ gate in shorter gate operation time. In terms of controlling waveforms, the three-level Fourier series wave is superior to the square wave and rounded trapezoidal wave in achieving lower gate error rate and shorter gate operation time, and can better meet the requirements for efficient implementation of high-fidelity quantum gates. Factors such as the coupler starting frequency and qubit frequency have relatively little effect on the fidelity of the CZ gate. In a wide frequency range, high-fidelity CZ gate can always be achieved by optimizing the control waveform parameters. It should be pointed out that slight deviations of control parameters will lead to a significant increase in gate error. This study is of great significance for clarifying the effects of various factors on the fidelity of the CZ gate. It can provide theoretical and technical support for designing superconducting quantum chips and realizing highfidelity CZ gate, thereby promoting the engineering development of quantum computing.

TI Quantum Amplitude-Phase Judgment Circuits for Full Quantization
   Algorithms
SO ADVANCED QUANTUM TECHNOLOGIES
AB Quantum algorithms are a crucial component of quantum computing. One key open question in this field is whether quantum algorithms (QAs) can be fully executed on a quantum computer. Many QAs currently rely on classical computers to evaluate conditional statements that quantum systems alone cannot assess. This dependency necessitates information transmission between quantum and classical systems, thus imposing performance limitations. To enable autonomous conditional evaluations on quantum systems, a quantum amplitude-phase judgment circuit (QAPJC), comprising primarily quantum inequality judgment circuits and equality judgment logic blocks, is proposed. This configuration achieves conditional judgment on quantum computers while imparting physical significance to the judgment process. The feasibility of the circuits is verified on a superconducting quantum computer. Comparative experiments confirm that QAPJC preserves the original performance of QAs while demonstrating the inherent advantages of quantum computing. This circuit can implement logic judgment functions akin to classical circuits and serve as a subroutine for various QAs, promoting their implementation in the noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) era.

TI Two-qubit gate using conditional driving for highly detuned Kerr
   nonlinear parametric oscillators
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB A Kerr nonlinear parametric oscillator (KPO) is one of the promising devices used to realize qubits for universal quantum computing. The KPO can stabilize two coherent states with opposite phases, yielding a quantum superposition called a Schrodinger cat state. Universal quantum computing with KPOs requires three kinds of quantum gates: Rz, Rx, and Rzz gates. We theoretically propose a two-qubit gate Rzz for highly detuned KPOs. In the proposed scheme, we add a parametric drive for the first KPO. This leads to the Rzz gate based on the driving of the second KPO depending on the first-KPO state, which we call "conditional driving." First, we perform simulations using a conventional KPO Hamiltonian derived from a superconducting-circuit model under some approximations and evaluate the gate fidelity. Next, we also perform numerical simulations of the two-qubit gate using the superconducting-circuit model without the approximations. The simulation results indicate that the conditional-driving gates can be implemented with high fidelity (>99.9%) for rotation angles required for universality.

TI Counterfactual Anonymous Quantum Teleportation in the Presence of
   Adversarial Attacks and Channel Noise
SO SENSORS
AB Hiding the identity of involved participants in the network, known as anonymity, is a crucial issue in some cryptographic applications such as electronic voting systems, auctions, digital signatures, and Byzantine agreements. This paper proposes a new anonymous quantum teleportation protocol based on counterfactual communication where no information-carrying particles pass through the channel. It is achieved by the distribution of a counterfactual entanglement among the participants in the network followed by the establishment of an anonymous entanglement between the sender and the receiver. Afterwards, the sender can anonymously teleport a quantum state to the receiver by utilizing the anonymous entanglement. However, the practicality of the anonymous quantum network mainly calls for two performance measures-robustness against adversarial attacks and noisy environments. Motivated by these demands, firstly, we prove the security of our proposed protocol and show that it achieves both the sender and receiver's anonymity in the presence of active adversaries and untrusted parties. Along with anonymity, we also ensure the correctness of the protocol and the privacy of the teleported qubit. Finally, we analyze the robustness of our proposed protocol under the presence of channel noise and compare its fidelity with those of the conventional protocols. The main advantage of our proposed protocol is that it can provide useful anonymous quantum resources for teleportation under noisy environment with a higher security compared to previous protocols.

TI Quantum annealing-based clustering of single cell RNA-seq data
SO BRIEFINGS IN BIOINFORMATICS
AB Cluster analysis is a crucial stage in the analysis and interpretation of single-cell gene expression (scRNA-seq) data. It is an inherently ill-posed problem whose solutions depend heavily on hyper-parameter and algorithmic choice. The popular approach of K-means clustering, for example, depends heavily on the choice of K and the convergence of the expectation-maximization algorithm to local minima of the objective. Exhaustive search of the space for multiple good quality solutions is known to be a complex problem. Here, we show that quantum computing offers a solution to exploring the cost function of clustering by quantum annealing, implemented on a quantum computing facility offered by D-Wave []. Out formulation extracts minimum vertex cover of an affinity graph to sub-sample the cell population and quantum annealing to optimise the cost function. A distribution of low-energy solutions can thus be extracted, offering alternate hypotheses about how genes group together in their space of expressions.

SO PATTERNS
AB The dynamics of cellular mechanisms can be investigated through the analysis of networks. One of the simplest but most popular modeling strategies involves logic-based models. However, these models still face exponential growth in simulation complexity compared with a linear increase in nodes. We transfer this modeling approach to quantum computing and use the upcoming technique in the field to simulate the resulting networks. Leveraging logic modeling in quantum computing has many benefits, including complexity reduction and quantum algorithms for systems biology tasks. To showcase the applicability of our approach to systems biology tasks, we implemented a model of mammalian cortical development. Here, we applied a quantum algorithm to estimate the tendency of the model to reach particular stable con-ditions and further revert dynamics. Results from two actual quantum processing units and a noisy simulator are presented, and current technical challenges are discussed.

TI A Distributed Learning Scheme for Variational Quantum Algorithms
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON QUANTUM ENGINEERING
AB Variational quantum algorithms (VQAs) are prime contenders to gain computational advantages over classical algorithms using near-term quantum machines. As such, many endeavors have been made to accelerate the optimization of modern VQAs in past years. To further improve the capability of VQAs, here, we propose a quantum distributed optimization scheme (dubbed as QUDIO), whose back ends support both real quantum devices and various quantum simulators. Unlike traditional VQAs subsuming a single quantum chip or simulator, QUDIO collaborates with multiple quantum machines or simulators to complete learning tasks. In doing so, the required wall-clock time for optimization can be continuously reduced by increasing the accessible computational resources when ignoring the communication and synchronization time. Moreover, through the lens of optimization theory, we unveil the potential factors that could affect the convergence of QUDIO. In addition, we systematically understand the ability of QUDIO to reduce wall-clock time via two standard benchmarks, which are hand-written image classification and the ground energy estimation of the dihydrogen. Our proposal facilitates the development of advanced VQAs to narrow the gap between the state of the art and applications with the quantum advantage.

TI Scalable Equivalence Checking and Verification of Shallow Quantum
   Circuits
SO PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACM ON PROGRAMMING LANGUAGES-PACMPL
AB This paper concerns the problem of checking if two shallow (i.e., constant-depth) quantum circuits perform equivalent computations. Equivalence checking is a fundamental correctness question-needed, e.g., for ensuring that transformations applied to a quantum circuit do not alter its behavior. For quantum circuits, the problem is challenging because a straightforward representation on a classical computer of each circuit's quantum state can require time and space that are exponential in the number of qubits n. The paper presents Projection-Based Equivalence Checking (PBEC), which provides decision procedures for two variants of the equivalence-checking problem. Both can be carried out on a classical computer in time and space that, for any fixed depth, is linear in n. Our key insight is that local projections can serve as constraints that fully characterize the output state of a shallow quantum circuit. The output state is the unique quantum state that satisfies all the constraints. Beyond equivalence checking, we show how to use the constraint representation to check a class of assertions, both statically and at run time. Our assertion-checking methods are sound and complete for assertions expressed as conjunctions of local projections. Our experiments showed that computing the constraint representation of a random 100-qubit 1D circuit of depth 6 takes 129.64 seconds. Equivalence checking between two random 100-qubit 1D circuits of depth 3 requires 4.46 seconds for fixed input | 0 >circle times 100, and no more than 31.96 seconds for arbitrary inputs. Computing the constraint description for a random 100-qubit circuit of depth 3 takes 6.99 seconds for a 2D structure, compared to 10.67 seconds for a circuit with arbitrary connectivity. At depth 2, equivalence checking takes 0.20 seconds for fixed input and 0.44 seconds for arbitrary input, with similar performance for both 2D and arbitrary-connectivity circuits.

TI Optical-domain spectral super-resolution via a quantum-memory-based
   time-frequency processor
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Existing super-resolution methods of optical imaging hold a solid place as an application in natural sciences, but many new developments allow for beating the diffraction limit in a more subtle way. One of the recently explored strategies to fully exploit information already present in the field is to perform a quantum-inspired tailored measurements. Here we exploit the full spectral information of the optical field in order to beat the Rayleigh limit in spectroscopy. We employ an optical quantum memory with spin-wave storage and an embedded processing capability to implement a time-inversion interferometer for input light, projecting the optical field in the symmetric-antisymmetric mode basis. Our tailored measurement achieves a resolution of 15 kHz and requires 20 times less photons than a corresponding Rayleigh-limited conventional method. We demonstrate the advantage of our technique over both conventional spectroscopy and heterodyne measurements, showing potential for application in distinguishing ultra-narrowband emitters, optical communication channels, or signals transduced from lower-frequency domains.
   Spectral super-resolution methods generally apply only to laser spectroscopy. Here, thanks to a Gradient Echo Memory with time-frequency processing capabilities, the authors are able to resolve frequency differences with precision below the Fourier limit for narrowband and ultra-low input-light level.

TI Efficient learning of t-doped stabilizer states with single-copy
   measurements
SO QUANTUM
AB One of the primary objectives in the field of quantum state learning is to develop algorithms that are time-efficient for learning states generated from quantum circuits. Earlier investigations have demonstrated time-efficient algorithms for states generated from Clifford circuits with at most log(n) non-Clifford gates. However, these algorithms necessitate multi-copy measurements, posing implementation challenges in the near term due to the requisite quantum memory. On the contrary, using solely single-qubit measurements in the computational basis is insufficient in learning even the output distribution of a Clifford circuit with one additional T gate under reasonable post-quantum cryptographic assumptions. In this work, we introduce an efficient quantum algorithm that employs only single-copy measurements to learn states produced by Clifford circuits with a filling a gap between the previous positive and negative results.

TI Coherent Addressing of Single Molecular Electron Spin Qubits
SO CHINESE JOURNAL OF CHEMISTRY
AB With rational designability, versatile tunability, and quantum coherence, molecular electron spin qubits could offer new opportunities for quantum information science, enabling simplified implementation of quantum algorithms and chemical-specific quantum sensing. The development of these transformative technologies relies on coherent addressing of single molecular electron spin qubits with high initialization, manipulation, and readout fidelities. This is unfeasible to conventional electron spin resonance spectroscopy, which is widely used for coherent addressing of ensemble electron spins, due to its low initialization efficiency and readout sensitivity. Taking advantage of single spin detectability of single-molecule spectroscopy, scanning tunneling microscopy, atomic force microscopy, and quantum metrology, several strategies have been developed to empower electron spin resonance spectroscopy with single qubit addressability. In this Emerging Topic, we introduce principles and technical implementation of strategies for coherent addressing of single molecular electron spin qubits, discuss their potential applicability in quantum technologies, and point out their challenges in terms of scalability, molecular design, and/or decoherence suppression. We discuss future directions to overcome these challenges and to improve single qubit addressing technologies, which will facilitate the advancement of molecular quantum information science.
   Emerging strategies to initialize, manipulate, and read out single electron spins enable coherent addressing of single molecular electron spin qubits. They will facilitate the advancement of molecular quantum information science.image

TI High-Precision Voltage Measurement for Optical Quantum Computation
SO ENERGIES
AB This paper presents a theoretical study into the use of optical systems for quantum computation. The study results pertain to quantum sampling and quantum communication and provide a basis for further research and the development of a physical implementation. We propose an optical superstructure that can implement specific computation processes and algorithms. The superstructure is composed of nonlinear optical units, such as beta barium borate crystals. The units are positioned in series, powered by a pulse laser pump, and culminate in a beam splitter that generates the output state of a number of entangled photon pairs. Computation is achieved by entanglement propagation via beam splitters and adjustable phase shifters, which set related parameters. Demonstrating a two-component case, we show how a series of cosine-based components can be implemented. The obtained results open a broad front for future research. Future work should investigate the construction of a quantum optimizer using quantum sampling methods and also investigate high-precision temporal voltage measurement, which is a key procedure for the construction of high-fidelity devices.

This rapidly developing field deals with the study and control of single quantum entities, i.e. atoms, ions, photons, which are no longer isolated but are parts of a larger system. Manipulation of these quantum entities forms the basis of modern quantum technology, from quantum computation to quantum communication and quantum sensing. One, therefore, needs to reconsider the basic concepts of state, evolution, and measurement for these so-called open quantum systems. This is a pedagogical review paper on the rudiments of modern quantum mechanics, which keeps citations to the literature to a minimum and assumes only a knowledge of elementary quantum mechanics. It is meant to prepare the reader for studying the modern research papers at the forefront of this field.

TI Parity measurement in the strong dispersive regime of circuit quantum
   acoustodynamics
SO NATURE PHYSICS
AB Mechanical resonators combined with superconducting circuits are a promising platform for controlling non-classical mechanical states. Here this platform is used to directly measure the parity of a motional quantum state.
   Mechanical resonators are emerging as an important new platform for quantum science and technologies. A large number of proposals for using them to store, process and transduce quantum information motivates the development of increasingly sophisticated techniques for controlling mechanical motion in the quantum regime. By interfacing mechanical resonators with superconducting circuits, circuit quantum acoustodynamics can make a variety of important tools available for manipulating and measuring motional quantum states. Here we demonstrate the direct measurements of phonon number distribution and parity of non-classical mechanical states. We do this by operating our system in the strong dispersive regime, where a superconducting qubit can be used to spectroscopically resolve the phonon Fock states. These measurements are some of the basic building blocks for constructing acoustic quantum memories and processors. Furthermore, our results open the door for performing even more complex quantum algorithms using mechanical systems, such as quantum error correction and multimode operations.

TI Quantum computing of fluid dynamics using the hydrodynamic Schrödinger
   equation
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Simulating fluid dynamics on a quantum computer is intrinsically difficult due to the nonlinear and non -Hamiltonian nature of the Navier-Stokes equation (NSE). We propose a framework for quantum computing of fluid dynamics based on the hydrodynamic Schrodinger equation (HSE), which can be promising in simulating three-dimensional turbulent flows in various engineering applications. The HSE is derived by generalizing the Madelung transform to compressible or incompressible flows with finite vorticity and dissipation. Since the HSE is expressed as a unitary operator on a two-component wave function, it is more suitable than the NSE for quantum computing. The flow governed by the HSE can resemble a turbulent flow consisting of tangled vortex tubes with the five-thirds scaling of energy spectrum. We develop a prediction-correction quantum algorithm to solve the HSE. This algorithm is implemented for simple flows on the quantum simulator Qiskit with partial exponential speedup.

TI Automatically differentiable quantum circuit for many-qubit state
   preparation
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Constructing quantum circuits for efficient state preparation are central topics in the field of quantum information and computation. As the number of qubits grows quickly, methods to derive large-scale quantum circuits are strongly desired. In this article, we propose the automatically differentiable quantum circuit (ADQC) approach to efficiently prepare quantum many-qubit states in the form of a matrix product state (MPS). A key ingredient is to introduce latent gates whose decompositions give unitary gates that form a quantum circuit. The circuit is optimized by updating the latent gates using backpropagation to minimize the distance between the evolved and target states Taking the ground states of one-dimensional spin lattice models and random matrix product states as examples, with the number of qubits where processing the full coefficients is unlikely, ADQC obtains high fidelities with small numbers of layers N-L similar to O(1). Much higher fidelities are obtained compared with the existing state-preparation approach based on the matrix product disentangler. In addition, ADQC provides an efficient representation of many-qubit states, whose number of parameters can be compressed to about 0.1%-1% of that in the MPS. Our work sheds light on the "intelligent construction" of quantum circuits for many-qubit systems by combining them with machine learning methods.

TI Optimized quantum sensor networks for ultralight dark matter detection
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW D
AB Dark matter (DM) remains one of the most compelling unresolved problems in fundamental physics, motivating the search for new detection approaches. We propose a network-based quantum sensor architecture to enhance sensitivity to ultralight DM fields. Each node in the network is a superconducting qubit, interconnected via controlled-Z gates in symmetric topologies such as line, ring, star, and fully connected graphs. We investigate four- and nine-qubit systems, optimizing both state preparation and measurement using a variational quantum metrology framework. This approach minimizes the quantum and classical Crame<acute accent>r-Rao bounds to identify optimal configurations. Bayesian inference is employed to extract the DM-induced phase shift from measurement outcomes. Our results show that optimized network configurations significantly outperform conventional Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger-based protocols while maintaining shallow circuit depths compatible with noisy intermediate-scale quantum hardware. Sensitivity remains robust under local dephasing noise. These findings highlight the importance of network structure in quantum sensing and point toward scalable strategies for quantum-enhanced DM detection.

TI Random Matrix Spectral Form Factor of Dual-Unitary Quantum Circuits
SO COMMUNICATIONS IN MATHEMATICAL PHYSICS
AB We investigate a class of local quantum circuits on chains of d-level systems (qudits) that share the so-called `dual unitarity' property. In essence, the latter property implies that these systems generate unitary dynamics not only when propagating in time, but also when propagating in space. We consider space-time homogeneous (Floquet) circuits and perturb them with a quenched single-site disorder, i.e. by applying independent single site random unitaries drawn from arbitrary non-singular distribution over SU(d), e.g. one concentrated around the identity, after each layer of the circuit. We identify the spectral form factor at time t in the limit of long chains as the dimension of the commutant of a finite set of operators on a qudit ring of t sites. For general dual unitary circuits of qubits (d = 2) and a family of their extensions to higher d > 2, we provide an explicit construction of the commutant and prove that spectral form factor exactly matches the prediction of circular unitary ensemble for all t, if only the local 2-qubit gates are different from a SWAP (non-interacting gate).

TI A Symbolic Approach to Discrete Structural Optimization Using Quantum
   Annealing
SO MATHEMATICS
AB With the advent of novel quantum computing technologies and the new possibilities thereby offered, a prime opportunity has presented itself to investigate the practical application of quantum computing. This work investigates the feasibility of using quantum annealing for structural optimization. The target problem is the discrete truss sizing problem-the goal is to select the best size for each truss member so as to minimize a stress-based objective function. To make the problem compatible with quantum annealing devices, the objective function must be translated into a quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO) form. This work focuses on exploring the feasibility of making this translation. The practicality of using a quantum annealer for such optimization problems is also assessed. A method is eventually established to translate the objective function into a QUBO form and have it solved by a quantum annealer. However, scaling the method to larger problems faces some challenges that would require further research to address.

AB Digital-analog quantum computing is a computational paradigm which employs an analog Hamiltonian resource together with single-qubit gates to reach universality. Here, we design a new scheme which employs an arbitrary two-body source Hamiltonian, extending the experimental applicability of this computational paradigm to most quantum platforms. We show that the simulation of an arbitrary two-body target Hamiltonian of n qubits requires O(n2) analog blocks with guaranteed positive times, providing a polynomial advantage compared to the previous scheme. Additionally, we propose a classical strategy which combines a Bayesian optimization with a gradient descent method, improving the performance by similar to 55% for small systems measured in the Frobenius norm.

TI A Framework for Migrating to Post-Quantum Cryptography: Security
   Dependency Analysis and Case Studies
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB Quantum computing is emerging as a significant threat to information protected by widely used cryptographic systems. Cryptographic methods, once deemed secure for decades, are now at risk of being compromised, posing a massive threat to the security of sensitive data and communications across enterprises worldwide. As a result, there is an urgent need to migrate to quantum-resistant cryptographic systems. This is no simple task. Migrating to a quantum-safe state is a complex process, and many organisations lack the in-house expertise to navigate this transition without guidance. In this paper, we present a comprehensive framework designed to assist enterprises with this migration. Our framework outlines essential steps involved in the cryptographic migration process, and leverages existing organisational inventories. The framework facilitates the efficient identification of cryptographic assets and can be integrated with other enterprise frameworks smoothly. To underscore its practicality and effectiveness, we have incorporated case studies that utilise graph-theoretic techniques to pinpoint and assess cryptographic dependencies. This is useful in prioritising crypto-systems for replacement.

TI Single-ion anisotropy effects on the critical behaviors of quantum
   entanglement and correlation in the spin-1 Heisenberg chain
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICS-CONDENSED MATTER
AB Quantum entanglement and correlations in the spin-1 Heisenberg chain with single-ion anisotropy are investigated using the quantum renormalization group method. Negativity and quantum discord (QD) are calculated with various anisotropy parameters o and single-ion anisotropy parameters D. We focus on the relations between two abovementioned physical quantities and on transitions between the Neel, Haldane, and large-D phases. It is found that both negativity and QD exhibit step-like patterns in different phases as the size of the system increases. Interestingly, the single-ion anisotropy parameter D, which can be modulated using nuclear electric resonance (2020 Nature 579 205), plays an important role in tuning the quantum phase transition (QPT) of the system. Both the first partial derivative of the negativity and QD with respect to D or o exhibit nonanalytic behavior at the phase transition points, which corresponds directly to the divergence of the correlation length. The quantum correlation critical exponents derived from negativity and QD are equal, and are the reciprocal of the correlation length exponent at each critical point. This work extends the application of quantum entanglement and correlations as tools for depicting QPTs in spin-1 systems.

TI Optical storage of circular airy beam in atomic vapor
SO CHINESE PHYSICS B
AB The realization of quantum storage of spatial light field is of great significance to the construction of high-dimensional quantum repeater. In this paper, we experimentally realize the storage and retrieval of circular Airy beams (CABs) by using the Lambda-type three-level energy system based on the electromagnetically induced transparency in a hot rubidium atomic vapor cell. The weak probe beam field is modulated with phase distribution of CABs by a spatial light modulator. We store the probe circular Airy beam (CAB) into the rubidium atomic vapor cell and retrieve it after the demanded delay. We quantitatively analyze the storage results and give corresponding theoretical explanations. Moreover, we investigate the autofocusing and self-healing effect of the retrieved CAB, which indicates that the properties and beam shape of CAB maintain well after storage. Our work will have potential applications in the storage of high-dimensional quantum information, and is also useful for improving the channel capacities of quantum internet.

TI Extendable optical phase synchronization of remote and independent
   quantum network nodes over deployed fibers
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW APPLIED
AB Entanglement generation between remote qubit systems is the central tasks for quantum communication. Future quantum networks will have to be compatible with low-loss telecom bands and operate with large separation between qubit nodes. Single-click heralding schemes can be used to increase entanglement rates at the cost of needing an optically phase-synchronized architecture. In this paper we present such a phase synchronization scheme for a metropolitan quantum network, operating in the low-loss telecom L band. To overcome various challenges such as communication delays and optical power limitations, the scheme consists of multiple tasks that are individually stabilized. We characterize each task, identify the main noise sources, motivate the design choices, and describe the synchronization schemes. The performance of each of the tasks is quantified by a transfer-function measurement that investigates the frequency response and feedback bandwidth. Finally we investigate the resulting optical phase stability of the fully deployed system over a continuous period of 10 h, reporting a short-term stability standard deviation of a 30 degrees and a long-term stability of the average optical phase to within a few degrees. The scheme presented served as a key enabling technology for a nitrogen-vacancy-center-based metropolitan quantum link. This scheme is of interest for other quantum network platforms that benefit from an extendable and telecom-compatible phase-synchronization solution.

TI Single-photon-based clock analysis and recovery in quantum key
   distribution
SO AVS QUANTUM SCIENCE
AB Quantum key distribution is one of the first quantum technologies ready for the market. Current quantum telecommunication systems usually utilize a service channel for synchronizing the transmitter (Alice) and the receiver (Bob). However, the possibility of removing this service channel and exploiting a clock recovery method are intriguing for future implementation, both in fiber and free-space links. In this paper, we investigate criteria to recover the clock in a quantum communication scenario and experimentally demonstrated the possibility of using a quantum-based clock recovery system in a time-bin quantum key distribution protocol. The performance of the clock recovery technique, in terms of quantum bit error rate and secret key rate, is equivalent to using the service channel for clock sharing.

TI Implementation of a Quantum Memory Protocol Based on the Revival of
   Silenced Echo in Orthogonal Geometry at the Telecommunication Wavelength
SO JETP LETTERS
AB An optical quantum memory protocol has been implemented on the basis of the revival of silenced echo at the telecommunication wavelength for signal light fields with a small number of photons. To this end, a long-lived (>1 s) absorption line has been initialized and the orthogonal geometry of the propagation of the signal and rephasing fields has been chosen. An efficiency of revival of (17 +/- 1)% has been reached for the orthogonal polarization components of a signal pulse at a storage time of 60 mu s. The input pulse contains similar to 38 photons on average, the revived echo signal includes similar to 6 photons, and the signal-to-noise ratio is 1.3.

TI Quantum image filtering and its reversible logic circuit design
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF EMBEDDED SYSTEMS
AB Quantum information processing can overcome the limitations of classical computation. Consequently, image filtering using quantum computation has become a research hotspot. Here, a quantum algorithm is presented on the basis of the classical image filtering principle to detect and cancel the noise of an image. To this end, a quantum algorithm that completes the image filtering task is proposed and implemented. The novel enhanced quantum representation of digital images is introduced. Then, four basic modules, namely, position-shifting, parallel-CNOT, parallel-swap, and compare the max, are demonstrated. Two composite modules that can be utilised to realise the reversible logic circuit of the proposed quantum algorithm are designed on the basis of these basic modules. Simulation-based experimental results show the feasibility and the capabilities of the proposed quantum image filtering scheme. In addition, our proposal has outperformed its classical counterpart and other existing quantum image filtering schemes supported by detailed theoretical analysis of the computational complexity. Thus, it can potentially be used for highly efficient image filtering in a quantum computer age.

TI A Sixteen-user Time-bin Entangled Quantum Communication Network With
   Fully Connected Topology
SO LASER & PHOTONICS REVIEWS
AB Quantum key distribution (QKD) promises unconditionally information-theoretic secure communication guaranteed by the laws of physics and has become one of the most crucial candidates in future security aspects. Developing a large-scale network with a scalable and integrated scheme is of great significance for expanding the advantages of QKD protocols among multiple users. Here, a sixteen-user fully connected quantum network by using a novel time-bin entangled source implemented in the integrated multi-channel periodically poled lithium niobate waveguides is proposed. Based on this entangled source, the quantum processor prepares 120 entangled photon pairs to allocate 15 links to each user by utilizing dense wavelength division multiplexing technology. To enable the users' communication with each other simultaneously, a phase-compensated Mach-Zehnder Interferometer based on a Fourier-transform setup to control the relative phase of the interferometer for all the involved wavelength channels is developed. The experimental results show that the network can support sixteen users for long-distance communication with each other simultaneously. The novel scheme of time-bin entangled sources paves an efficient way for implementing large-scale quantum resources in a compact integrated platform, and the time-bin entangled network promises a new potential for constructing large-scale and extensible quantum networks with an integrated photonic architecture.

SO ADVANCED QUANTUM TECHNOLOGIES
AB The interplay between superconductivity and ferromagnetism in the superconductor/ferromagnet (SC/FM) heterostructures generates many interesting physical phenomena, including spin-triplet superconductivity, superconducting order parameter oscillation, and topological superconductivity. The unique physical properties make the SC/FM heterostructure as promising platforms for future superconducting spintronics and quantum computation applications. In this article, important research progress of SC/FM heterostructures from superconducting spintronics to quantum computation is reviewed, and it is organized as follows. First, the progress of spin current carriers in SC/FM heterostructures including Bogoliubov quasiparticles, superconducting vortex, and spin-triplet Cooper pairs which might be used for long-range spin transport is discussed. Then, the pi Josephson junctions and their application for constructing pi qubits are described. Finally, experimental signatures of Majorana states in the SC/FM heterostructures and the theoretically proposed manipulation are briefly reviewed, which could be useful to realize fault-tolerant topological quantum computing.

TI A systematic review of quantum machine learning for digital health
SO NPJ DIGITAL MEDICINE
AB The growth in digitization of health data provides opportunities for using algorithmic techniques for data analysis. This systematic review assesses whether quantum machine learning (QML) algorithms outperform existing classical methods for clinical decisioning or health service delivery. Included studies use electronic health/medical records, or reasonable proxy data, and QML algorithms designed for quantum computing hardware. Databases PubMed, Embase, IEEE, Scopus, and preprint server arXiv were searched for studies dated 01/01/2015-10/06/2024. Of an initial 4915 studies, 169 were eligible, with 123 then excluded for insufficient rigor. Only 16 studies consider realistic operating conditions involving quantum hardware or noisy simulations. We find nearly all encountered quantum models form a subset of general QML structures. Scalability of data encoding is partly addressed but requires restrictive hardware assumptions. Overall, performance differentials between quantum and classical algorithms show no consistent trend to support empirical quantum utility in digital health.

AB Krein space quantization and the ambient space formalism have been successfully applied to address challenges in quantum geometry (e.g. quantum gravity) and the axiomatic formulation of quantum Yang-Mills theory, including phenomena such as color confinement and the mass gap. Building on these advancements, we aim to extend these methods to develop novel quantum algorithms for quantum computation, particularly targeting underdetermined or ill-conditioned linear systems of equations, as well as quantum systems characterized by non-unitary evolution and open quantum dynamics. This approach represents a significant step beyond commonly used techniques, such as Quantum Singular Value Decomposition, Sz.-Nagy dilation, and Unitary Operator Decomposition. The proposed algorithm has the potential to establish a unified framework for quantum algorithms.

TI Interplays between classical and quantum entanglement-assisted
   communication scenarios
SO NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB Prepare-and-measure scenarios (pm), in their many forms, can be seen as the basic building blocks of communication tasks. As such, they can be used to analyze a diversity of classical and quantum protocols-of which dense coding and random access codes are key examples-in a unified manner. In particular, the use of entanglement as a resource in pm scenarios have only recently started to be systematically investigated, and many crucial questions remain open. In this work, we explore such scenarios and provide answers to some seminal questions. More specifically, we show that, in scenarios where entanglement is a free resource, quantum messages are equivalent to classical ones with twice the capacity. We also prove that, in such scenarios, it is always advantageous for the parties to share entangled states of dimension greater than the transmitted message. Finally, we show that unsteerable states cannot provide advantages in classical communication tasks, thus proving that not all entangled states are useful resources in these scenarios.

TI Detecting quantum entanglement with unsupervised learning
SO QUANTUM SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB Quantum properties, such as entanglement and coherence, are indispensable resources in various quantum information processing tasks. However, there still lacks an efficient and scalable way to detecting these useful features especially for high-dimensional and multipartite quantum systems. In this work, we exploit the convexity of samples without the desired quantum features and design an unsupervised machine learning method to detect the presence of such features as anomalies. Particularly, in the context of entanglement detection, we propose a complex-valued neural network composed of pseudo-siamese network and generative adversarial net, and then train it with only separable states to construct non-linear witnesses for entanglement. It is shown via numerical examples, ranging from two-qubit to ten-qubit systems, that our network is able to achieve high detection accuracy which is above 97.5% on average. Moreover, it is capable of revealing rich structures of entanglement, such as partial entanglement among subsystems. Our results are readily applicable to the detection of other quantum resources such as Bell nonlocality and steerability, and thus our work could provide a powerful tool to extract quantum features hidden in multipartite quantum data.

TI A Cost and Power Feasibility Analysis of Quantum Annealing for NextG
   Cellular Wireless Networks
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON QUANTUM ENGINEERING
AB In order to meet mobile cellular users' ever-increasing data demands, today's 4G and 5G wireless networks are designed mainly with the goal of maximizing spectral efficiency. While they have made progress in this regard, controlling the carbon footprint and operational costs of such networks remains a long-standing problem among network designers. This article takes a long view on this problem, envisioning a NextG scenario where the network leverages quantum annealing for cellular baseband processing. We gather and synthesize insights on power consumption, computational throughput and latency, spectral efficiency, operational cost, and feasibility timelines surrounding quantum annealing technology. Armed with these data, we project the quantitative performance targets future quantum annealing hardware must meet in order to provide a computational and power advantage over complementary metal-oxide semiconductor (CMOS) hardware, while matching its whole-network spectral efficiency. Our quantitative analysis predicts, that with 82.32 mu s problem latency and 2.68 M qubits, quantum annealing will achieve a spectral efficiency equal to CMOS while reducing power consumption by 41 kW (45% lower) in a large MIMO base station with 400-MHz bandwidth and 64 antennas, and a 160-kW power reduction (55% lower) using 8.04 M qubits in a centralized radio access network setting with three large MIMO base stations.

TI Interpreting variational quantum models with active paths in
   parameterized quantum circuits
SO MACHINE LEARNING-SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB Variational quantum machine learning (VQML) models based on parameterized quantum circuits (PQC) have been expected to offer a potential quantum advantage for machine learning (ML) applications. However, comparison between VQML models and their classical counterparts is hard due to the lack of interpretability of VQML models. In this study, we introduce a graphical approach to analyze the PQC and the corresponding operation of VQML models to deal with this problem. In particular, we utilize the Stokes representation of quantum states to treat VQML models as network models based on the corresponding representations of basic gates. From this approach, we suggest the notion of active paths in the networks and relate the expressivity of VQML models with it. We investigate the growth of active paths in VQML models and observe that the expressivity of VQML models can be significantly limited for certain cases. Then we construct classical models inspired by our graphical interpretation of VQML models and show that they can emulate or outperform the outputs of VQML models for these cases. Our result provides a new way to interpret the operation of VQML models and facilitates the interconnection between quantum and classical ML areas.

TI Memory-Occupied Routing Algorithms for Quantum Relay Networks
SO CMC-COMPUTERS MATERIALS & CONTINUA
AB Quantum transmission experiments have shown that the success-ful transmission rate of entangled quanta in optical fibers decreases expo-nentially. Although current quantum networks deploy quantum relays to establish long-distance connections, the increase in transmission distance and entanglement switching costs still need to be considered when selecting the next hop. However, most of the existing quantum network models prefer to consider the parameters of the physical layer, which ignore the influence factors of the network layer. In this paper, we propose a meshy quantum network model based on quantum teleportation, which considers both net-work layer and physical layer parameters. The proposed model can reflect the realistic transmission characteristics and morphological characteristics of the quantum relay network. Then, we study the network throughput of different routing algorithms with the same given parameters when multiple source-destination pairs are interconnected simultaneously. To solve the chal-lenges of routing competition caused by the simultaneous transmission, we present greedy memory-occupied algorithm Q-GMOA and random memory -occupied algorithm Q-RMOA. The proposed meshy quantum network model and the memory-occupied routing algorithms can improve the utilization rate of resources and the transmission performance of the quantum network. And the evaluation results indicate that the proposed methods embrace a higher transmission rate than the previous methods with repeater occupation.

TI Optimisation of pulse waveforms for qubit gates using deep learning
SO QUANTUM MACHINE INTELLIGENCE
AB In this paper, we propose a novel method using deep neural networks (DNNs) to optimize the parameters of pulse waveforms used for manipulating qubit states, resulting in the high-fidelity implementation of qubit gates. High-fidelity quantum logic gates are crucial for scaling up current quantum computers. The proposed approach uses DNNs to model the functional relationship between amplitudes of pulse waveforms used in scheduling and the corresponding fidelities. The DNNs are trained using a dataset of amplitude and corresponding fidelities obtained through simulations of qubit gates in Qiskit. A two-stage approach is used with the trained DNNs to obtain amplitudes that yield the highest fidelity. The proposed method is evaluated by estimating the amplitude for pulse scheduling of single (Hadamard and Pauli-X) and two-qubit gates (CNOT). The results clearly indicate that the method can achieve high-fidelity implementations of single-qubit gates with fidelities of 0.999976 and 0.999923 for Hadamard and Pauli-X gates, respectively. For the CNOT gate, the best fidelity obtained is 0.695313. This can be attributed to the effects of entanglement and the need for the phase parameter to be accounted for within the predictive model.

TI Generally noise-resilient quantum gates for trapped ions
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB We present an entangling gate scheme that achieves high-fidelity operations with excited motional states, despite multiple error sources. While we demonstrate this approach for trapped-ion chains, the underlying principles are applicable to a wide range of quantum computing platforms. Our scheme incorporates all relevant motional modes and exhibits enhanced robustness against both motional heating effects and detuning errors, critical features for building robust and scalable quantum computers.

TI Hardware-Efficient Leakage-Reduction Scheme for Quantum Error Correction
   with Superconducting Transmon Qubits
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB Leakage outside of the qubit computational subspace poses a threatening challenge to quantum error correction (QEC). We propose a scheme using two leakage-reduction units (LRUs) that mitigate these issues for a transmon-based surface code, without requiring an overhead in terms of hardware or QEC-cycle time as in previous proposals. For data qubits, we consider a microwave drive to transfer leakage to the readout resonator, where it quickly decays, ensuring that this negligibly disturbs the computational states for realistic system parameters. For ancilla qubits, we apply a vertical bar 1 > <-> vertical bar 2 > pi pulse conditioned on the measurement outcome. Using density-matrix simulations of the distance-3 surface code, we show that the average leakage lifetime is reduced to almost one QEC cycle, even when the LRUs are implemented with limited fidelity. Furthermore, we show that this leads to a significant reduction of the logical error rate. This LRU scheme opens the prospect for near-term scalable QEC demonstrations.

TI Numerical Simulation of Optimal Entanglement Network Protocols for
   Multiple States
SO JORDAN JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB Entanglement has been one of the dominant aspects distinguishing quantum theory from its classical counterpart. Indeed, entanglement has played a central role in recent developments in quantum technology, such as quantum computing, key distribution, etc. In order to use entanglement in these situations, a particular form is often needed, namely the maximal case. Various techniques have been used to manipulate entangled states, especially between distant parties. Generating long-distance entanglement from multiple shorter states has been studied, and it has been shown that there exists a class of states that can achieve optimal entanglement resources. In this paper, the particular class of states that yields the weakest link is numerically examined. The findings reveal that the range of this class is limited but substantial.

TI Quantum Wavelength-Division Multiplexing and Multiple-Access
   Communication Systems and Networks: Advanced Applications
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON QUANTUM ENGINEERING
AB A cost-effective global quantum Internet may be developed using the existing communication infrastructure. This article examines the quantum version of three conventional wavelength-division-multiplexing and multiple-access (WDM) communication systems and networks. They are Lambdanet-based broadcast WDM networks, quantum routers based on a waveguide grating router, and fiber-to-the-quantum nodes that are fed by two opposing and extreme quantum light signals, namely the coherent (Glauber) and number (Fock) states. Using the coherent states, we identify the classical behavior of the quantum WDM (QWDM) networks. Furthermore, employing quantum single-photon sources and exclusive quantum results, such as quantum correlations occurring in the receivers's states, are studied in these WDM communication systems and networks. Finally, we provide secure-key rate estimation for Lambdanet- and waveguide grating router (WGR)-based quantum key distribution networks leveraging the developed QWDM. As compared to Lambdanet, WGR obtains a higher rate of secure keys.

TI Experimental hierarchy and optimal robustness of quantum correlations of
   two-qubit states with controllable white noise
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB We demonstrate a hierarchy of various classes of quantum correlations on experimentally prepared two-qubit Werner-like states with controllable white noise. Werner states, which are white-noise-affected Bell states, are prototypal examples for studying sucha hierarchy as a function of the amount of white noise. We experimentally generate Werner states and their generalizations, i.e., partially entangled pure states affected by white noise. These states enable us to study the hierarchy of the following classes of correlations: separability, entanglement, steering in three-and two-measurement scenarios, and Bell nonlocality. We show that the generalized Werner states (GWSs) reveal fundamentally different aspects of the hierarchy compared to the Werner states. In particular, we find five different parameter regimes of the GWSs, including those steerable in a two-measurement scenario but not violating Bell inequalities. This regime cannot be observed for the usual Werner states. Moreover, we find threshold curves separating different regimes of the quantum correlations and find the optimal states which allow for the largest amount of white noise which does not destroy their specific quantum correlations (e.g., unsteerable entanglement). Thus, we could identify the optimal Bell-nondiagonal GWSs which are, for this specific meaning, more robust against the white noise compared to the Bell-diagonal GWSs (i.e., Werner states).

TI All-optical cat-code quantum error correction
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB The cat code is a promising encoding scheme for bosonic quantum error correction as it allows for correction against losses-the dominant error mechanism in most bosonic systems. However, it has remained unclear how the required syndrome measurement and recovery can be implemented in the optical regime. Here, we introduce a teleportation-based error-correction scheme for the cat code, using elements suitable for an optical setting. The scheme detects and corrects single-photon losses while restoring the amplitude of the cat states, thereby greatly suppressing the accumulation of errors in lossy channels.

TI An Architecture for Control of Entanglement Generation Switches in
   Quantum Networks
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON QUANTUM ENGINEERING
AB Entanglement between quantum network nodes is often produced using intermediary devices-such as heralding stations-as a resource. When scaling quantum networks to many nodes, requiring a dedicated intermediary device for every pair of nodes introduces high costs. Here, we propose a cost-effective architecture to connect many quantum network nodes via a central quantum network hub called an entanglement generation switch (EGS). The EGS allows multiple quantum nodes to be connected at a fixed resource cost, by sharing the resources needed to make entanglement. We propose an algorithm called the rate control protocol, which moderates the level of competition for access to the hub's resources between sets of users. We proceed to prove a convergence theorem for rates yielded by the algorithm. To derive the algorithm we work in the framework of network utility maximization and make use of the theory of Lagrange multipliers and Lagrangian duality. Our EGS architecture lays the groundwork for developing control architectures compatible with other types of quantum network hubs as well as system models of greater complexity.

TI Broken Arrows: Hardy-Unruh Chains and Quantum Contextuality
SO ENTROPY
AB Hardy and Unruh constructed a family of non-maximally entangled states of pairs of particles giving rise to correlations that cannot be accounted for with a local hidden-variable theory. Rather than pointing to violations of some Bell inequality, however, they pointed to apparent clashes with the basic rules of logic. Specifically, they constructed these states and the associated measurement settings in such a way that the outcomes satisfy some conditionals but not an additional one entailed by them. Quantum mechanics avoids the broken 'if horizontal ellipsis then horizontal ellipsis ' arrows in such Hardy-Unruh chains, as we call them, because it cannot simultaneously assign truth values to all conditionals involved. Measurements to determine the truth value of some preclude measurements to determine the truth value of others. Hardy-Unruh chains thus nicely illustrate quantum contextuality: which variables do and do not obtain definite values depends on what measurements we decide to perform. Using a framework inspired by Bub and Pitowsky and developed in our book Understanding Quantum Raffles (co-authored with Michael E. Cuffaro), we construct and analyze Hardy-Unruh chains in terms of fictitious bananas mimicking the behavior of spin-12 particles.

TI Logical-qubit operations in an error-detecting surface code
SO NATURE PHYSICS
AB Future fault-tolerant quantum computers will require storing and processing quantum data in logical qubits. Here we realize a suite of logical operations on a distance-2 surface code qubit built from seven physical qubits and stabilized using repeated error-detection cycles. Logical operations include initialization into arbitrary states, measurement in the cardinal bases of the Bloch sphere and a universal set of single-qubit gates. For each type of operation, we observe higher performance for fault-tolerant variants over non-fault-tolerant variants, and quantify the difference. In particular, we demonstrate process tomography of logical gates, using the notion of a logical Pauli transfer matrix. This integration of high-fidelity logical operations with a scalable scheme for repeated stabilization is a milestone on the road to quantum error correction with higher-distance superconducting surface codes.
   Large-scale quantum computers will manipulate quantum information encoded in error-corrected logical qubits. A complete set of operations has now been realized on a logical qubit with error detection.

TI Quantum algorithms for approximate function loading
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Loading classical data into quantum computers represents an essential stage in many relevant quantum algorithms, especially in the field of quantum machine learning. Therefore, the inefficiency of this loading process means a major bottleneck for the application of these algorithms. Here, we introduce two approximate quantum-state preparation methods for the noisy intermediate-scale quantum era inspired by the Grover-Rudolph algorithm, which partially solve the problem of loading real functions. Indeed, by allowing for an infidelity e and under certain smoothness conditions, we prove that the complexity of the implementation of the Grover-Rudolph algorithm without ancillary qubits, first introduced by Mottonen et al., results into O(2k0(0), with n the number of qubits and k0(e) asymptotically independent of n. This leads to a dramatic reduction in the number of required two-qubit gates. Aroused by this result, we also propose a variational algorithm capable of loading functions beyond the aforementioned smoothness conditions. Our variational Ansatz is explicitly tailored to the landscape of the function, leading to a quasioptimized number of hyperparameters. This allows us to achieve high fidelity in the loaded state with high speed convergence for the studied examples.

TI Localized-to-delocalized spatial quantum correlation evolution in
   structured bright twin beams
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Quantum correlations in the spatial domain hold great promise for applications in quantum imaging, quantum cryptography and quantum information processing, owing to the infinite dimensionality of the associated Hilbert space. Here, we present a theoretical investigation, complemented by experimental measurements, of the propagation dynamics of the spatial quantum correlations in bright structured twin beams generated via a four-wave mixing process in a double-A configuration in atomic vapor. We derive an analytical expression describing the evolution of the spatial quantum correlation distribution from the near field to the far field. To qualitatively support the theoretical predictions, we perform experiments measuring intensity-difference noise between different spatial subregions of the twin beams as they propagate from the near field to the far field. The presence of quantum correlations is manifested as squeezing in the intensity-difference noise measurement. With a Gaussian pump, we observe localized correlations in the near field and localized anticorrelations in the far field. In contrast, with a structured Laguerre-Gaussian pump, there is a transition from localized correlations in the near field to delocalized correlations in the far field. The present results offer valuable insights into the fundamental behavior of spatial quantum correlations and open possibilities for potential applications in quantum information, quantum imaging, and sensing.

TI A fault-tolerant variational quantum algorithm with limited
   T-depth
SO QUANTUM SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB We propose a variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) algorithm that uses a fault-tolerant (FT) gate-set, and is hence suitable for implementation on a future error-corrected quantum computer. VQE quantum circuits are typically designed for near-term, noisy quantum devices and have continuously parameterized rotation gates as the central building block. On the other hand, an FT quantum computer (FTQC) can only implement a discrete set of logical gates, such as the so-called Clifford+T gates. We show that the energy minimization of VQE can be performed with such an FT discrete gate-set, where we use the Ross-Selinger algorithm to transpile the continuous rotation gates to the error-correctable Clifford+T gate-set. We find that there is no loss of convergence when compared to the one of parameterized circuits if an adaptive accuracy of the transpilation is used in the VQE optimization. State preparation with VQE requires only a moderate number of T-gates, depending on the system size and transpilation accuracy. We demonstrate these properties on emulators for two prototypical spin models with up to 16 qubits. This is a promising result for the integration of VQE and more generally variational algorithms in the emerging FT setting, where they can form building blocks of the general quantum algorithms that will become accessible in an FTQC.

TI Chaos in coupled Kerr-nonlinear parametric oscillators
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB A Kerr-nonlinear parametric oscillator (KPO) can generate a quantum superposition of two oscillating states, known as a Schrodinger cat state, via quantum adiabatic evolution and can be used as a qubit for gate-based quantum computing and quantum annealing. In this work, we investigate complex dynamics, i.e., chaos, in two coupled nondissipative KPOs at a few-photon level. After showing that a classical model for this system is nonintegrable and consequently exhibits chaotic behavior, we provide quantum counterparts for the classical results, which are quantum versions of the Poincare surface of section and its lower-dimensional version defined with time integrals of the Wigner and Husimi functions and also the initial and long-term behavior of out-of-time ordered correlators. We conclude that some of them can be regarded as quantum signatures of chaos, together with energy-level spacing statistics (conventional signature). Thus, the system of coupled KPOs is expected to offer not only an alternative approach to quantum computing but also a promising platform for the study on quantum chaos.

TI Shuttling for Scalable Trapped-Ion Quantum Computers
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON COMPUTER-AIDED DESIGN OF INTEGRATED CIRCUITS AND
   SYSTEMS
AB Trapped-ion quantum computers exhibit promising potential to provide platforms for high-quality qubits and reliable quantum computation. The quantum charge coupled device (QCCD) architecture is a leading example that offers a modular solution to enable the realization of scalable quantum computers, paving the way for practical quantum algorithms with large qubit numbers. Within these devices, ions can be shuttled (moved) throughout the trap and through different dedicated zones, e.g., a memory zone for storage and a processing zone for the actual computation. However, due to decoherence of the ions' quantum states, the qubits lose their quantum information over time. Thus, the required time steps of shuttling operations should be minimized. In this work,1 we propose a heuristic approach to determining an efficient shuttling schedule, which orchestrates the movement operations within the device. Given a quantum algorithm and a device architecture, the proposed approach produces shuttling schedules with a close-to-minimal amount of time steps for small-size QCCD architectures. For large-scale QCCD devices, empirical evaluations show promising results with respect to quality of the solution as well as performance. An implementation of the proposed approach is publicly available as part of the open-source Munich Quantum Toolkit (MQT) at https://github.com/cda-tum/mqt-ion-shuttler.

TI Transcription and optimization of an interplanetary trajectory through
   quantum annealing
SO ASTRODYNAMICS
AB This study employed a quantum-annealing framework to solve spacecraft trajectory optimization problems. Quantum annealing belongs to the field of quantum computing and is a promising technique for tackling hard binary optimization problems by employing quantum annealers. To address the optimal control of a trajectory using quantum annealing, a transcription procedure was introduced to express the problem in the binary optimization form required. The proposed procedure leverages the pseudospectral method to discretize the trajectory and represents the dynamical constraints as algebraic equality constraints at specific nodes. Subsequently, both a linearization procedure and binary representation strategy for the real-valued variables of the problem were presented, leading to the quadratic binary unconstrained optimization form. The quantum-annealing-based method was tested in the context of an interplanetary low-thrust transfer from the Earth to Mars. First, we discussed which instances of the problem, especially in terms of their dimensions, are implementable on currently available quantum annealers; then, a solution was sought by employing annealers from D-Wave systems. Solutions from hybrid solvers that combine classical and quantum resources, and fully quantum solvers were explored. The results demonstrate the validity of the transcription approach, demonstrate the ability of the hybrid solver to tackle the case-study problem, and highlight the promising features and current limitations of practical trajectory optimization with quantum annealing.

TI Quantum-annealing-inspired algorithms for multijet clustering
SO PHYSICS LETTERS B
AB Jet clustering or reconstruction is a crucial component at high-energy colliders, a procedure to identify sprays of collimated particles originating from the fragmentation and hadronization of quarks and gluons. It is a complicated combinatorial optimization problem and requires intensive computing resources. In this study, we formulate jet reconstruction as a quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO) problem and introduce novel quantum-annealing-inspired algorithms for clustering multiple jets in electron-positron collision events. One of these quantum-annealing-inspired algorithms, ballistic simulated bifurcation, overcomes problems previously observed in multijet clustering with quantum-annealing approaches. We find that both the distance defined in the QUBO matrix and the prediction power of the QUBO solvers have crucial impacts on the multijet clustering performance. This study opens up a new approach to globally reconstructing multijet beyond dijet in one go, in contrast to the traditional iterative method.

TI Modeling Short-Range Microwave Networks to Scale Superconducting Quantum
   Computation
SO QUANTUM
AB A core challenge for superconducting quantum computers is to scale up the number of qubits in each processor without increasing noise or cross-talk. Distributed quantum computing across small qubit arrays, known as chiplets, can address these challenges in a scalable manner. We propose a chiplet architecture over microwave links with potential to exceed monolithic performance on near-term hardware. Our methods of modeling and evaluating the chiplet architecture bridge the physical and network layers in these processors. We find evidence that distributing computation across chiplets may reduce the overall error rates associated with moving data across the device, despite higher error figures for transfers across links. Preliminary analyses suggest that latency is not substantially impacted, and that at least some applications and architectures may avoid bottlenecks around chiplet boundaries. In the long-term, short-range networks may underlie quantum computers just as local area networks underlie classical datacenters and supercomputers today.

TI The Rise of Quantum Information and Communication Technologies
SO QUANTUM REPORTS
AB Today, we are already using several-component devices and systems based on the technologies developed during the first quantum revolution. Examples include microchips for servers, laptops and smartphones, medical imaging devices, LED, lasers, etc. Now, a second quantum revolution is progressing fast, exploiting technological advances for the ability to engineer and manipulate other quantum phenomena such as superposition, entanglement and measurement. As a matter of fact, there is an impressive increase in research and development activities, innovation, public and private investments in a new wave of quantum services and applications. In this scenario, quantum information and communication technologies (QICTs) can be defined as a set of technological components, devices, systems and methods for elaborating, storing and transmitting/sharing quantum information. This paper addresses the challenges and opportunities enabling the rise of QICTs. In order to provide a concrete example, the paper describes an overview of the European project EQUO (European Quantum ecOsystems) dealing with ongoing innovation activities in the QICT avenue; in fact, EQUO aims at developing and demonstrating the feasibility of QKD (quantum key distribution) networks and their related integration in current telecommunications infrastructures towards the quantum internet.

TI Machine-learning based high-bandwidth magnetic sensing
SO MACHINE LEARNING-SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB Recent years have seen significant growth of quantum technologies, and specifically quantum sensing, both in terms of the capabilities of advanced platforms and their applications. One of the leading platforms in this context is nitrogen-vacancy (NV) color centers in diamond, providing versatile, high-sensitivity, and high-spatial-resolution magnetic sensing. Nevertheless, current schemes for spin resonance magnetic sensing (as applied by NV quantum sensing) suffer from tradeoffs associated with sensitivity, dynamic range, and bandwidth. Here we address this issue, and implement machine learning tools to enhance NV magnetic sensing in terms of the sensitivity/bandwidth tradeoff in large dynamic range scenarios. Our results indicate a potential reduction of required data points by at least a factor of 3, while maintaining the current error level. Our results promote quantum machine learning protocols for sensing applications towards more feasible and efficient quantum technologies.

TI Quantum Optimization Approaches in Medical Imaging: Advances in Quantum
   Algorithms for Medical Tomography
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON QUANTUM ENGINEERING
AB Quantum computing has emerged as a promising paradigm for addressing complex computational problems that are challenging for classical methods within a practical time frame. In the context of tomographic image reconstruction, quantum optimization algorithms enable faster processing and clearer imaging than conventional methods. This study presents a proof-of-concept demonstration of quadratic unconstrained binary optimization-based reconstruction with error-excluded sinogram masking, reducing the required projection angles for tomographic reconstruction and simultaneously enhancing robustness against image artifacts. Notably, experimental evaluations demonstrated that the proposed algorithm accurately reconstructed tomographic images without artifacts, even when up to 50% error was introduced into the sinogram to induce ring artifacts. Furthermore, it achieved precise reconstructions using only 50% of the projection angles from the original sinogram spanning 0 degrees-180 degrees. These findings highlight the potential of quantum algorithms to advance tomographic imaging by enabling efficient and accurate reconstructions under challenging conditions, paving the way for broader applications in medical imaging, material science, and advanced tomography systems as quantum computing technologies continue to advance.

TI Reinforcement-learning generation of four-qubit entangled states
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB We have devised an artificial intelligence algorithm with machine reinforcement learning (Q-learning) to construct remarkable entangled states with four qubits. This way, the algorithm is able to generate representative states for some of the 49 true SLOCC classes of the four-qubit entanglement states. In particular, it is possible to reach at least one true SLOCC class for each of the nine entanglement families. The quantum circuits synthesized by the algorithm may be useful for the experimental realization of these important classes of entangled states and to draw conclusions about the intrinsic properties of our universe. We introduce a graphical tool called the state-link graph (SLG) to represent the construction of the quality matrix (Q-matrix) used by the algorithm to build a given objective state belonging to the corresponding entanglement class. This allows us to discover the necessary connections between specific entanglement features and the role of certain quantum gates, which the algorithm needs to include in the quantum gate set of actions. The quantum circuits found are optimal by construction with respect to the quantum gate-set chosen. These SLGs make the algorithm simple, intuitive, and a useful resource for the automated construction of entangled states with a low number of qubits.

TI Quadratic Clifford expansion for efficient benchmarking and
   initialization of variational quantum algorithms
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Variational quantum algorithms are considered to be appealing applications of near-term quantum computers. However, it has been unclear whether they can outperform classical algorithms or not. To reveal their limitations, we must seek a technique to benchmark them on large-scale problems. Here we propose a perturbative approach for efficient benchmarking of variational quantum algorithms. The proposed technique performs perturbative expansion of a circuit consisting of Clifford and Pauli rotation gates, which is enabled by exploiting the classical simulatability of Clifford circuits. Our method can be applied to a wide family of parameterized quantum circuits consisting of Clifford gates and single-qubit rotation gates. The approximate optimal parameter obtained by the method can also serve as an initial guess for further optimizations on a quantum device. As the first application of the method, we perform a benchmark of so-called hardware-efficient-type ansatzes when they are applied to the variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) of one-dimensional hydrogen chains up to H-24, which corresponds to a 48-qubit system using a standard workstation. This is the largest scale benchmark of the VQE to the best of our knowledge and reveals the limitation of hardware-efficient-type ansatzes.

TI Qubit-Efficient Randomized Quantum Algorithms for Linear Algebra
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB We propose a class of randomized quantum algorithms for the task of sampling from matrix functions, without the use of quantum block encodings or any other coherent oracle access to the matrix elements. As such, our use of qubits is purely algorithmic and no additional qubits are required for quantum data structures. Our algorithms start from a classical data structure in which the matrix of interest is specified in the Pauli basis. For N x N Hermitian matrices, the space cost is log(N) + 1 qubits and, depending on the structure of the matrices, the gate complexity can be comparable to state-of-the-art methods that use quantum data structures of up to size O(N2), when considering equivalent end-to-end problems. Within our framework, we present a quantum linear system solver that allows one to sample properties of the solution vector, as well as algorithms for sampling properties of ground states and Gibbs states of Hamiltonians. As a concrete application, we combine these subroutines to present a scheme for calculating Green's functions of quantum many-body systems.

AB There is no unique way to encode a quantum algorithm into a quantum circuit. With limited qubit counts, connectivities, and coherence times, circuit optimization is essential to make the best use of quantum devices produced over a next decade. We introduce two separate ideas for circuit optimization and combine them in a multi -tiered quantum circuit optimization protocol called AQCEL. The first ingredient is a technique to recognize repeated patterns of quantum gates, opening up the possibility of future hardware optimization. The second ingredient is an approach to reduce circuit complexity by identifying zero- or low -amplitude computational basis states and redundant gates. As a demonstration, AQCEL is deployed on an iterative and efficient quantum algorithm designed to model final state radiation in high energy physics. For this algorithm, our optimization scheme brings a significant reduction in the gate count without losing any accuracy compared to the original circuit. Additionally, we have investigated whether this can be demonstrated on a quantum computer using polynomial resources. Our technique is generic and can be useful for a wide variety of quantum algorithms.

TI Quantum Computing is Scalable on a Planar Array of Qubits with
   Fabrication
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW APPLIED
AB To successfully execute large-scale algorithms, a quantum computer will need to perform its elementary operations near perfectly. This is a fundamental challenge since all physical qubits suffer a considerable level of noise. Moreover, real systems are likely to have a finite yield, i.e., some nonzero proportion of the components in a complex device may be irredeemably broken at the fabrication stage. We present a threshold theorem showing that an arbitrarily large quantum computation can be completed with a vanishing probability of failure using a two-dimensional array of noisy qubits with a finite density of fabrication defects. To complete our proof we introduce a robust protocol to measure high-weight stabilizers to compensate for large regions of inactive qubits. We obtain our result using a surface-code architecture. Our approach is therefore readily compatible with ongoing experimental efforts to build a large-scale quantum computer.

TI Differentiable quantum architecture search
SO QUANTUM SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB Quantum architecture search (QAS) is the process of automating architecture engineering of quantum circuits. It has been desired to construct a powerful and general QAS platform which can significantly accelerate current efforts to identify quantum advantages of error-prone and depth-limited quantum circuits in the NISQ era. Hereby, we propose a general framework of differentiable quantum architecture search (DQAS), which enables automated designs of quantum circuits in an end-to-end differentiable fashion. We present several examples of circuit design problems to demonstrate the power of DQAS. For instance, unitary operations are decomposed into quantum gates, noisy circuits are re-designed to improve accuracy, and circuit layouts for quantum approximation optimization algorithm are automatically discovered and upgraded for combinatorial optimization problems. These results not only manifest the vast potential of DQAS being an essential tool for the NISQ application developments, but also present an interesting research topic from the theoretical perspective as it draws inspirations from the newly emerging interdisciplinary paradigms of differentiable programming, probabilistic programming, and quantum programming.

This paper identifies a security loophole in the initial universal half-blind quantum computation protocol and resolves it using operation teleportation. Simultaneously, to minimize quantum resource consumption for both the client and the server, the proposed protocol relies on the universal gate set H, T, and CX, and only necessitates the client's ability to prepare qubits in the eigenstates of Pauli gates X and Y or measure qubits based on these gates. Finally, a sample example is provided to illustrate the proposed protocol effectively.

TI Single-shot readout of a superconducting qubit using a thermal detector
SO NATURE ELECTRONICS
AB Measuring the state of a qubit is a key fundamental operation of a quantum computer. High-fidelity single-shot readout of superconducting qubits can be achieved using parametric amplifiers at millikelvin temperatures. However, scaling parametric amplifiers beyond hundreds of qubits is challenging due to practical size and power limitations. Nanobolometers can, in contrast, offer scalability, sensitivity and speed suitable for qubit readout. Here we show that a bolometer can provide single-shot qubit readout with a readout duration of 13.9 mu s and a single-shot fidelity of 0.618. The fidelity is mainly limited by the energy relaxation time of the qubit (28 mu s), and a fidelity of 0.927 is found after removing errors arising from this relaxation. In the future, higher-fidelity single-shot readout may be achieved through improvements in chip design and experimental setup, as well as a change in the bolometer absorber material to reduce the readout time to the level of hundreds of nanoseconds and below.
   Bolometers can be used for qubit readout, offering a scalable, sensitive and high-speed alternative to current parametric-amplifier-based approaches.

TI Learning the hierarchy of steering measurement settings of qubit-pair
   states with kernel-based quantum models
SO NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB Quantum steering has been proven to be a unique quantum correlation sandwiched between Bell nonlocality and quantum entanglement. Due to its fundamental importance, quantum steering has been studied extensively. To demonstrate steerability, one relies on a particular resource referred to as steerable assemble on one side of a two-party system. However, it is generically unclear how to reach such steerable resource from a bipartite quantum state. For this purpose, one must optimize over all possible measurement settings, which constitute a hierarchical structure. On the other hand, in light of the rapid development of quantum computing technology, quantum machine learning (QML) has emerged as a field with a promising potential in demonstrating quantum advantage. Here we leverage the power of kernel-based QML models to infer the hierarchy of steering measurement settings. By using a computational protocol, we can generate an appropriate dataset necessary for training the models. Additionally, based on the physics of quantum steering, we encode the states to be recognized into five different types of features. This helps us identify the most compact characterization of Alice-to-Bob steerability, which is Alice's regularly aligned steering ellipsoid. We then apply the well-trained models to predict the hierarchy for three specific families of states. We also compare the QML model with two classical models, demonstrating its superior performance, as well as the practical quantum advantage.

TI Noisy quantum computation modeled by quantum walk: universality without
   ancillas
SO QUANTUM SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB The universal quantum-walk-based quantum computation model by Childs has opened the door for a new way of studying the limitations and advantages of quantum computation, as well as for its intermediate-term simulation. In recent years, the growing interest in noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) computers has lead to intense efforts being directed at understanding the computational advantages of open quantum systems. In this work, we extend the quantum walk model to open noisy systems in order to provide such a tool for the study of NISQ computers. Our method does not use explicit purification, and allows to ignore the environment degrees of freedom and obtain a much more efficient implementation (linear rather than exponential in the runtime), which employs no ancillas, hence provides direct access to the entanglement properties of the system. In our scheme, the quantum walk amplitudes represent elements of the density matrix rather than the wavefunction of a pure state. Despite the non-trivial manifestation of the normalization requirement in this setting, we model the application of general unitary gates and nonunitary channels, with an explicit implementation protocol for channels that are commonly used in noise models.

TI Leveraging Quantum Machine Learning to Address Class Imbalance: A Novel
   Approach for Enhanced Predictive Accuracy
SO SYMMETRY-BASEL
AB The class imbalance problem presents a critical challenge in real-world applications, particularly in high-stakes domains such as healthcare, finance, disaster management, and fault diagnosis, where accurate anomaly detection is paramount. Class imbalance often disrupts the inherent symmetry of data distributions, resulting in suboptimal performance of traditional machine learning models. Conventional approaches such as undersampling and oversampling are commonly employed to address this issue; however, these methods can introduce additional asymmetries, including information loss and overfitting, which ultimately compromise model efficacy. This study introduces an innovative approach leveraging quantum machine learning (QML), specifically the Variational Quantum Classifier (VQC), to restore and capitalize on the symmetrical properties of data distributions without relying on resampling techniques. By employing quantum circuits optimized to mitigate the asymmetries inherent in imbalanced datasets, the proposed method demonstrates consistently superior performance across diverse datasets, with notable improvements in Recall for minority classes. These findings underscore the potential of quantum machine learning as a robust alternative to classical methods, offering a symmetry-aware solution to class imbalance and advancing QML-driven technologies in fields where equitable representation and symmetry are of critical importance.

TI Quantum computing simulation of the hydrogen molecular ground-state
   energies with limited resources
SO OPEN PHYSICS
AB In this article, the hydrogen molecular groundstate energies using our algorithm based on quantum variational principle are calculated. They are calculated through a simulator since the system of the present study (i.e., the hydrogen molecule) is relatively small and hence the ground-state energies for this molecule are efficiently classically simulable using a simulator. Complete details of this algorithm are elucidated. For this, a full description on the fermions-qubits and the molecular Hamiltonian-qubit Hamiltonian transformations, is given. The authors search for qubit systemparameters (theta(0) and theta(1)) that yield the minimum energies for the system and also study the ground state energies as a function of the molecular bond length. Proposed circuit is humble and does not include many parameters compared with that of Kandala et al., the authors control only two parameters (theta(0) and theta(1)).

TI A qubit-efficient variational selected configuration-interaction method
SO QUANTUM SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB Finding the ground-state energy of molecules is an important and challenging computational problem for which quantum computing can potentially find efficient solutions. The variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) is a quantum algorithm that tackles the molecular groundstate problem and is regarded as one of the flagships of quantum computing. Yet, to date, only very small molecules were computed via VQE, due to high noise levels in current quantum devices. Here we present an alternative variational quantum scheme that requires significantly less qubits than VQE. The reduction in the qubit number allows for shallower circuits to be sufficient, rendering the method more resistant to noise. The proposed algorithm, termed variational quantum selected-configuration-interaction (VQ-SCI), is based on: (a) representing the target groundstate as a superposition of Slater determinant configurations, encoded directly upon the quantum computational basis states; and (b) selecting a-priory only the most dominant configurations. This is demonstrated through a set of groundstate calculations of the H-2, LiH, BeH2, H2O, NH3 and C2H4 molecules in the sto-3g basis set, performed on IBM quantum devices. We show that the VQ-SCI reaches the full configuration interaction energy within chemical accuracy using the lowest number of qubits reported to date. Moreover, when the SCI matrix is generated 'on the fly', the VQ-SCI requires exponentially less memory than classical SCI methods. This offers a potential remedy to a severe memory bottleneck problem in classical SCI calculations. Finally, the proposed scheme is general and can be straightforwardly applied for finding the groundstate of any Hermitian matrix, outside the chemical context.

TI Classification Analysis of Transition Metal Compounds Using Quantum
   Machine Learning
SO ADVANCED QUANTUM TECHNOLOGIES
AB Quantum machine learning (QML) leverages the potential of machine learning (ML) to explore the subtle patterns in huge datasets of complex nature with quantum advantages. QML accelerates materials research with active screening of chemical space, identifying novel materials for practical applications, and classifying structurally diverse materials given their measured properties. This study analyzes the performance of three efficient quantum machine learning algorithms viz., variational quantum classifier (VQC), quantum support vector classifier (QSVC), and quantum neural networks (QNN) for distinguishing transition metal chalcogenides (TMCs) from transitional metal oxides (TMOs). By employing feature selection, classical machine learning achieves 100% accuracy whereas QML achieves the highest performance of 99% and 98% for test and train data respectively on QSVC. Further, to extend the QML models for structural and functional analysis of materials that cannot be inferred directly from the formula, stability analysis, and magnetic nature analysis on 1000 and 500 materials are performed, respectively. The stability analysis achieves 78% accuracy with QSVC and the magnetic nature analysis achieves 88% with QNN establishing the competence of QML models. This study proves that QML models are remarkable in materials classification and analysis which fuels the task of materials discovery in the future.

TI Resumable probabilistic teleportation of a three qubit state using
   different quantum channels
SO PHYSICA SCRIPTA
AB In this paper we describe two different probabilistic teleportation protocols for teleporting the same unknown 3-qubit state from the sender Alice to the receiver Bob. The speciality of the state is that it remains a 2-qubit entangled state after any of the three involved qubits is eliminated by partial trace operation. One of the protocols utilizes a two and a three-qubit separate channels while in the other protocol, a five-qubit channel is utilized. One of the channels in the first protocol is a non-maximally entangled Bell state while the 5-qubit channel used in the case of the second protocol is non-maximally entangled. Both the teleportation schemes are probabilistic with the feature that in the case of failure of the teleportation, the state to be teleported is not lost to the sender. So the process can be repeated after failure till success is achieved. Moreover, one of the channels is recovered in the failure case. Both protocols are resumable in the above sense. The above is the speciality of the present work. We analyze the efficiency of our protocol which shows that the present two protocols are better performing than some existing ones.

The material also hosts high-quality defects with long coherence times that can be used for quantum computation and sensing applications. Using an ensemble of nitrogen-vacancy centers and an XY82 correlation spectroscopy approach, we demonstrate a room-temperature quantum sensing of an artificial AC field centered at similar to 900 kHz with a spectral resolution of 10 kHz. Implementing the synchronized readout technique, we further extend the frequency resolution of our sensor to 0.01 kHz. These results pave the first steps for silicon carbide quantum sensors toward low-cost nuclear magnetic resonance spectrometers with a wide range of practical applications in medical, chemical, and biological analysis.

TI SpinQ: Compilation Strategies for Scalable Spin-Qubit Architectures
SO ACM TRANSACTIONS ON QUANTUM COMPUTING
AB Despite Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum devices being severely constrained, hardware- and algorithm-aware quantum circuit mapping techniques have been developed to enable successful algorithm executions. Not so much attention has been paid to mapping and compilation implementations for spin-qubit quantum processors due to the scarce availability of experimental devices and their small sizes. However, based on their high scalability potential and their rapid progress it is timely to start exploring solutions on such devices. In this work, we discuss the unique mapping challenges of a scalable crossbar architecture with shared control and introduce SpinQ, the first native compilation framework for scalable spin-qubit architectures. At the core of SpinQ is the Integrated Strategy that addresses the unique operational constraints of the crossbar while considering compilation scalability and obtaining a O(n) computational complexity. To evaluate the performance of SpinQ on this novel architecture, we compiled a broad set of well-defined quantum circuits and performed an in-depth analysis based on multiple metrics such as gate overhead, depth overhead, and estimated success probability, which in turn allowed us to create unique mapping and architectural insights. Finally, we propose novel mapping techniques that could increase algorithm success rates on this architecture and potentially inspire further research on quantum circuit mapping for other scalable spin-qubit architectures.

TI GALIC: hybrid multi-qubitwise pauli grouping for quantum computing
   measurement
SO QUANTUM SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB Observable estimation is a core primitive in NISQ-era algorithms targeting quantum chemistry applications. To reduce the state preparation overhead required for accurate estimation, recent works have proposed various simultaneous measurement schemes to lower estimator variance. Two primary grouping schemes have been proposed: full commutativity (FC) and qubit-wise commutativity (QWC), with no compelling means of interpolation. In this work we propose a generalized framework for designing and analyzing context-aware hybrid FC/QWC commutativity relations. We use our framework to propose a noise-and-connectivity aware grouping strategy: Generalized backend-Aware pauLI Commutation (GALIC). We demonstrate how GALIC interpolates between FC and QWC, maintaining estimator accuracy in Hamiltonian estimation while lowering variance by an average of 20% compared to QWC. We also explore the design space of near-term quantum devices using the GALIC framework, specifically comparing device noise levels and connectivity. We find that error suppression has a more than 10 x larger impact on device-aware estimator variance than qubit connectivity with even larger correlation differences in estimator biases.

AB We analyze propagation of quantum information along chiral Majorana edge states in two-dimensional topological materials. The use of edge states may facilitate the braiding operation, an important ingredient in topological quantum computations. For the edge of the Kitaev honeycomb model in a topological phase, we discuss how the edge states can participate in quantum-information processing, and consider a two-qubit logic gate between distant external qubits coupled to the edge. Here we analyze the influence of disorder and noise on properties of the edge states and quantum-gate fidelity. We find that realistically weak disorder does not prevent one from implementation of a high-fidelity operation via the edge.

We compare this encoding with the traditional one-hot methods and find that they outperform the one-hot encoding for three different problems at different sizes of both the problem and the variables. From these results, we conclude that the domain-wall encoding yields superior performance against a variety of metrics furthermore; we do not find a single metric by which one hot performs better. We even find that a 2000Q quantum annealer with a drastically less connected hardware graph but using the domain-wall encoding can outperform the next-generation Advantage processor if that processor uses one-hot encoding.

SO CHINESE PHYSICS LETTERS
AB The solutions of the problems related to open quantum systems have attracted considerable interest. We propose a variational quantum algorithm to find the steady state of open quantum systems. In this algorithm, we employ parameterized quantum circuits to prepare the purification of the steady state and define the cost function based on the Lindblad master equation, which can be efficiently evaluated with quantum circuits. We then optimize the parameters of the quantum circuit to find the steady state. Numerical simulations are performed on the one-dimensional transverse field Ising model with dissipative channels. The result shows that the fidelity between the optimal mixed state and the true steady state is over 99%. This algorithm is derived from the natural idea of expressing mixed states with purification and it provides a reference for the study of open quantum systems.

TI Loop-Back Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) for Secure and Scalable
   Multi-Node Quantum Networks
SO SYMMETRY-BASEL
AB Quantum key distribution (QKD) is a cornerstone of secure communication in the quantum era, yet most existing protocols are designed for point-to-point transmission, limiting their scalability in networked environments. In this work, we introduce Loop-Back QKD, a novel QKD protocol that supports both two-party linear configurations and scalable multiuser ring topologies. By leveraging a structured turn-based mechanism and bidirectional pulse propagation, the protocol enables efficient key distribution while reducing the quantum bit error rate (QBER) through a multi-pulse approach. Unlike trusted-node QKD networks, Loop-Back QKD eliminates intermediate-node vulnerabilities, as secret keys are never processed by intermediate nodes. Furthermore, unlike Measurement-Device-Independent (MDI-QKD) and Twin-Field QKD (TF-QKD), which require complex entanglement-based setups, Loop-Back QKD relies solely on direct polarization transformations, reducing vulnerability to side-channel attacks and practical implementation challenges. Additionally, our analysis indicates that multi-pulse Loop-Back QKD can tolerate higher QBER thresholds. However, this increased robustness comes at the cost of a lower key rate efficiency compared to standard QKD schemes. This design choice enhances its robustness against real-world adversarial threats, making it a strong candidate for secure multiuser communication in local and metropolitan-scale quantum networks.

TI QKD Based on Symmetric Entangled Bernstein-Vazirani
SO ENTROPY
AB This paper introduces a novel entanglement-based QKD protocol, that makes use of a modified symmetric version of the Bernstein-Vazirani algorithm, in order to achieve secure and efficient key distribution. Two variants of the protocol, one fully symmetric and one semi-symmetric, are presented. In both cases, the spatially separated Alice and Bob share multiple EPR pairs, each one qubit of the pair. The fully symmetric version allows both parties to input their tentative secret key from their respective location and acquire in the end a totally new and original key, an idea which was inspired by the Diffie-Hellman key exchange protocol. In the semi-symmetric version, Alice sends her chosen secret key to Bob (or vice versa). The performance of both protocols against an eavesdroppers attack is analyzed.

TI Universal logical quantum photonic neural network processor via
   cavity-assisted interactions
SO NPJ QUANTUM INFORMATION
AB Encoding quantum information within bosonic modes offers a promising direction for hardware-efficient and fault-tolerant quantum information processing. However, achieving high-fidelity universal control over bosonic encodings using native photonic hardware remains a significant challenge. We establish a quantum control framework to prepare and perform universal logical operations on arbitrary multimode multi-photon states using a quantum photonic neural network. Central to our approach is the optical nonlinearity, which is realized through strong light-matter interaction with a three-level Lambda atomic system. The dynamics of this passive interaction are asymptotically confined to the single-mode subspace, enabling the construction of deterministic entangling gates and overcoming limitations faced by many nonlinear optical mechanisms. Using this nonlinearity as the element-wise activation function, we show that the proposed architecture is able to deterministically prepare a wide array of multimode multi-photon states, including essential resource states. We demonstrate universal code-agnostic control of bosonic encodings by preparing and performing logical operations on symmetry-protected error-correcting codes. Our architecture is not constrained by symmetries imposed by evolution under a system Hamiltonian such as purely chi(2) and chi(3) processes, and is naturally suited to implement non-transversal gates on photonic logical qubits. Additionally, we propose an error-correction scheme based on non-demolition measurements that is facilitated by the optical nonlinearity as a building block. Our results pave the way for near-term quantum photonic processors that enable error-corrected quantum computation, and can be achieved using present-day integrated photonic hardware.

TI Midcircuit Operations Using the omg Architecture in Neutral Atom
   Arrays
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW X
AB Midcircuit operations, such as qubit state measurement or reset, are central to many tasks in quantum information science, including quantum computing, entanglement generation, and metrology. For instance, in quantum error correction, the information gained from a measurement on a subset of qubits is used to influence the state of the remaining unmeasured qubits, rectifying inevitable errors that arise in a quantum circuit. Such partial projective operations pose a challenge for dense neutral atom arrays and trapped ions, where accidental exposure to resonant laser light during quantum state initialization and detection can spoil the state of untargeted qubits. In this work, we implement midcircuit operations in a 48-site array of neutral atoms, enabled by new methods for high-fidelity control of the omg (optical-metastable-ground-state qubit) architecture present in 171Yb. Here, the quantum information is encoded in either of the three qubit manifolds and can be shuttled between them. With state-sensitive shelving between the ground and metastable states, we realize a nondestructive state detection for 171Yb, incorporating global control and local feed-forward operations. Using new schemes for local addressing of the optical clock transition, we shelve a subset of qubits to the metastable state, hiding them from projective operations performed on the qubits remaining in the ground state, demonstrating midcircuit measurement, spin reset, and motional reset in the form of ground-state cooling.

TI Integration of Quantum Accelerators with High Performance Computing-A
   Review of Quantum Programming Tools
SO ACM TRANSACTIONS ON QUANTUM COMPUTING
AB Quantum computing (QC) introduces a novel mode of computation with the possibility of greater computational power that remains to be exploited-presenting exciting opportunities for high-performance computing (HPC) applications. However, recent advancements in the field have made clear that QC does not supplant conventional HPC, but can rather be incorporated into current heterogeneous HPC infrastructures as an additional accelerator, thereby enabling the optimal utilization of both paradigms. The desire for such integration significantly affects the development of software for quantum computers, which in turn influences the necessary software infrastructure. To date, previous review articles have investigated various quantum programming tools (QPTs) (such as languages, libraries, frameworks) in their ability to program, compile, and execute quantum circuits. However, the integration effort with classical HPC frameworks or systems has not been addressed. This study aims to characterize existing QPTs from an HPC perspective, investigating if existing QPTs have the potential to be efficiently integrated with classical computing models and determining where work is still required. This work structures a set of criteria into an analysis blueprint that enables HPC scientists to assess whether a QPT is suitable for a high-performance computing - quantum computing (HPCQC) environment.

TI A Dynamically Programmable Quantum Photonic Microprocessor for Graph
   Computation
SO LASER & PHOTONICS REVIEWS
AB Quantum computing has grown extensively, especially in system design and development, and the current research focus has gradually evolved from validating quantum advantage to practical applications. In particular, nondeterministic-polynomial-time (NP)-complete problems are central in numerous important application areas. Still, in practice, it is difficult to solved efficiently with conventional computers, limited by the exponential jump in hardness. Here, a quantum photonic microprocessor based on Gaussian boson sampling (GBS) that offers dynamic programmability to solve various graph-related NP-complete problems is demonstrated. The system with optical, electrical, and thermal packaging implements a GBS with 16 modes of single-mode squeezed vacuum states, a universal programmable 16-mode interferometer, and a single photon readout on all outputs with high accuracy, generality, and controllability. The developed system is applied to demonstrate applications in solving NP-complete problems, manifesting the ability of photonic quantum computing to realize practical applications for conventionally intractable computations. The GBS-based quantum photonic microprocessor is applied to solve task assignment, Boolean satisfiability, graph clique, max cut, and vertex cover. These demonstrations suggest an excellent benchmarking platform, paving the way toward large-scale combinatorial optimization.

TI Ultrastrong coupling, nonselective measurement and quantum Zeno dynamics
SO QUANTUM
AB We study the dynamics of an open quantum system linearly coupled to a bosonic reservoir. We show that, in the ultrastrong coupling limit, the system undergoes a nonselective measurement and then evolves unitarily according to an effective Zeno Hamiltonian. This dynamical process is largely independent of the reservoir state. We examine the entanglement breaking effect of the ultrastrong coupling on the system. We also derive the evolution equation for systems in contact with several reservoirs when one coupling is ultrastrong. The effective system dynamics displays a rich structure and, contrarily to the single reservoir case, it is generally non-Markovian. Our approach is based on a Dyson series expansion, in which we can take the ultrastrong limit termwise, and a subsequent resummation of the series. Our derivation is mathematically rigorous and uncomplicated.

TI Strictly incoherent operations for one-qubit systems
SO PHYSICS LETTERS A
AB Strictly incoherent operations (SIO) proposed in Winter and Yang (2016) [13] are promising to be a good candidate of free operations in the resource theory of quantum coherence, setting against the central role of local operations and classical communication in the resource theory of quantum entanglement. An important open problem for SIOs is to find minimal parametrization with operational efficiency. Such a description plays key role for axiomatic study of resource theory of quantum coherence. We are aimed to give a structural characterization of bistochastic SIOs in terms of Pauli operators and the Phase operator for one-qubit systems. Some applications of our results are also sketched in reconstructing quantum thermal averages via a quantum computer and in coherence manipulation. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Simple and Tighter Derivation of Achievability for Classical
   Communication Over Quantum Channels
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB Achievability in information theory refers to demonstrating a coding strategy that accomplishes a prescribed performance benchmark for the underlying task. In quantum information theory, the crafted Hayashi-Nagaoka operator inequality is an essential technique in proving a wealth of one-shot achievability bounds since it effectively resembles a union bound in various problems. In this work, we show that the so-called pretty-good measurement naturally plays a role as the union bound as well. A judicious application of it considerably simplifies the derivation of one-shot achievability for classical-quantum channel coding via an elegant three-line proof. The proposed analysis enjoys the following favorable features. (i) The established one-shot bound admits a closed-form expression as in the celebrated Holevo-Helstrom theorem. Namely, the average error probability of sending M messages through a classical-quantum channel is upper bounded by the minimum error of distinguishing the joint channel input-output state against (M - 1) decoupled product states. (ii) Our bound directly yields asymptotic achievability results in the large deviation, small deviation, and moderate deviation regimes in a unified manner. (iii) The coefficients incurred in applying the Hayashi-Nagaoka operator inequality or the quantum union bound are no longer needed. Hence, the derived one-shot bound sharpens existing results relying on the Hayashi Nagaoka operator inequality. In particular, we obtain the tightest achievable epsilon-one-shot capacity for classical communication over quantum channels heretofore, improving the third-order coding rate in the asymptotic scenario. (iv) Our result holds for infinite-dimensional Hilbert space. (v) The proposed method applies to deriving one-shot achievability for classical data compression with quantum side information, entanglement-assisted classical communication over quantum channels, and various quantum network information-processing protocols.

TI A First Successful Factorization of RSA-2048 Integer by D-Wave Quantum
   Computer
SO TSINGHUA SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB Integer factorization, the core of the Rivest-Shamir-Adleman (RSA) attack, is an exciting but formidable challenge. As of this year, a group of researchers' latest quantum supremacy chip remains unavailable for cryptanalysis. Quantum annealing (QA) has a unique quantum tunneling advantage, which can escape local extremum in the exponential solution space, finding the global optimal solution with a higher probability. Consequently, we consider it an effective method for attacking cryptography. According to Origin Quantum Computing, QA computers are able to factor numbers several orders of magnitude larger than universal quantum computers. We try to transform the integer factorization problem in RSA attacks into a combinatorial optimization problem by using the QA algorithm of D-Wave quantum computer, and attack RSA-2048 which is composed of a class of special integers. The experiment factored this class of integers of size 2 (2048) , N=pxq As an example, the article gives the results of 10 RSA-2048 attacks in the appendix. This marks the first successful factorization of RSA-2048 by D-Wave quantum computer, regardless of employing mathematical or quantum techniques, despite dealing with special integers, exceeding 2 (1061) -1 of California State University. This experiment verifies that the QA algorithm based on D-Wave is an effective method to attack RSA.

TI Synchrotron Radiation for Quantum Technology
SO ADVANCED FUNCTIONAL MATERIALS
AB In recent years, quantum technology has undergone transformative advancements, opening up unprecedented possibilities in computation, metrology, sensing, and communication and reshaping the landscape of scientific research. Based on superposition, interference, and entanglement of quantum states, quantum systems leverage the core principles of quantum mechanics to achieve performances that were once deemed impossible or computationally insurmountable by classical methods. However, the practical realization of devices hinges on the conservation of these quantum states and their precise manipulation, requiring materials engineering with atomic precision on many length scales -a formidable challenge. Synchrotron light and free-electron laser (FEL) facilities, widely employed across diverse scientific and engineering disciplines, provide important single techniques and suites of multimodal non-destructive imaging and diagnostic tools to reveal electronic, structural, and morphological properties of matter on device level. This article delves into how these tools can help to unlock the potential of quantum device technologies, overcoming production barriers and paving the way for future breakthroughs. Moreover, the article presents quantum optics in the x-ray regime using synchrotron and FEL light sources and addresses the potential of quantum computing for synchrotron-radiation experiments.

Specifically, we find that electron energy combs enable nondestructive measurements of the photonic state and can induce arbitrary gates. Moreover, a single electron interacting with multiple photonic modes can create highly entangled states such as Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger states and cluster states of GKPs.

TI Hawking effect on the universal relationship between quantum steering
   and the first-order coherence in Schwarzschild spacetime
SO PHYSICS LETTERS B
AB Quantum steering and coherence are fundamental resources for quantum computation and quantum communication. Understanding their interplay under different environments is crucial for optimizing quantum information tasks. In this letter, we derive a complementary relation between the steering criterion based on infinite measurements and the first-order coherence. Then, we research Hawking effect on our complementarity formula in Schwarzschild spacetime. Quantum steering always decreases as the Hawking temperature increases, but the complementary relation between quantum steering and the first-order coherence for two-qubit states is satisfied, which means that quantum resources have been redistributed in this case. Our derived equation offers the convenient analytical solution of the steering criterion based on infinite measurements for arbitrary two-qubit states only using the first-order coherence and the purity of the state, thereby opening up new possibilities for further research on quantum steering. This research not only deepens our understanding on the relationship between quantum steering and coherence, but also provides a more accessible method for quantifying steering in two-qubit systems-a significant simplification for experimental implementations.

AB Quantum computing is becoming more accessible with increasing numbers of quantum platforms. The confidentiality and integrity of data and algorithms running on these systems are important assets that need to be protected from untrusted parties. Previous approaches focus on the encryption of individual sub-areas, often using at least hybrid clients, and do not take the entire path from the classical client via a platform to the quantum computing hard-ware into consideration. Based on the classification of quantum algorithms we show the assets worth protecting, evolve the data flow on third-party quantum hardware and quantum computing platforms, and propose a concept architecture addressing confidentiality and integrity of processed data and code. Our approach shows that confidentiality can already be achieved for data with classical clients, while code confidentiality remains an open question. Our approach covers integrity for most complexity classes.

AB The rapidly growing interest in quantum computing also increases the importance of securing these computers from various physical attacks. Constantly increasing qubit counts and improvements to the fidelity of the quantum computers hold great promise for the ability of these computers to run novel algorithms with highly sensitive intellectual property. However, in today's cloud-based quantum computer setting, users lack physical control over the computers. Physical attacks, such as those perpetrated by malicious insiders in data centers, could be used to extract sensitive information about the circuits being executed on these computers. This work shows the first exploration and study of power-based side-channel attacks in quantum computers. The explored attacks could be used to recover information about the control pulses sent to these computers. By analyzing these control pulses, attackers can reverse-engineer the equivalent gate-level description of the circuits, and the algorithms being run, or data hard-coded into the circuits. This work introduces five new types of attacks, and evaluates them using control pulse information available from cloud-based quantum computers. This work demonstrates how and what circuits could be recovered, and then in turn how to defend from the newly demonstrated side-channel attacks on quantum computing systems.

TI Dominant Reaction Pathways by Quantum Computing
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB Characterizing thermally activated transitions in high-dimensional rugged energy surfaces is a very challenging task for classical computers. Here, we develop a quantum annealing scheme to solve this problem. First, the task of finding the most probable transition paths in configuration space is reduced to a shortest-path problem defined on a suitable weighted graph. Next, this optimization problem is mapped into finding the ground state of a generalized Ising model. A finite-size scaling analysis suggests this task may be solvable efficiently by a quantum annealing machine. Our approach leverages on the quantized nature of qubits to describe transitions between different system's configurations. Since it does not involve any lattice space discretization, it paves the way towards future biophysical applications of quantum computing based on realistic all-atom models.

TI Complete Bell state measurement of diamond nuclear spins under a
   complete spatial symmetry at zero magnetic field
SO APPLIED PHYSICS LETTERS
AB The symmetry of the space where a spin qubit resides plays an essential role in the manipulation of quantum entanglement, which governs the performance of quantum information systems. Application of a magnetic field, which is usually necessary for spin manipulation and readout, inevitably breaks the spatial symmetry to induce competition among quantization axes between internal and external fields, thus limiting the purity of the entanglement. If we could manipulate and readout entanglement under a zero magnetic field, we would be able to avoid the competition among quantization axes to achieve ideally high fidelity. We here demonstrate the complete Bell state measurement, which is a core element of quantum processing, of two carbon nuclear spins in the vicinity of a diamond nitrogen-vacancy center. The demonstration was made possible by holonomic entanglement manipulations based on the geometric phase with a polarized microwave under a zero magnetic field, where the quantization axis is uniquely defined by the hyperfine field. The demonstrated scheme allows high-fidelity entanglement processing even when magnetic fields cannot be applied to the integration of superconducting and spin qubits, thereby paving the way for building fault-tolerant distributed quantum computers and quantum repeater networks.& nbsp;(C) 2022 Author(s).

TI Nanocavity-Mediated Purcell Enhancement of Er in TiO2 Thin
   Films Grown via Atomic Layer Deposition
SO ACS NANO
AB The use of trivalent erbium (Er3+), typically embedded as an atomic defect in the solid-state, has widespread adoption as a dopant in telecommunication devices and shows promise as a spin-based quantum memory for quantum communication. In particular, its natural telecom C-band optical transition and spin-photon interface make it an ideal candidate for integration into existing optical fiber networks without the need for quantum frequency conversion. However, successful scaling requires a host material with few intrinsic nuclear spins, compatibility with semiconductor foundry processes, and straightforward integration with silicon photonics. Here, we present Er-doped titanium dioxide (TiO2) thin film growth on silicon substrates using a foundry-scalable atomic layer deposition process with a wide range of doping controls over the Er concentration. Even though the as-grown films are amorphous after oxygen annealing, they exhibit relatively large crystalline grains, and the embedded Er ions exhibit the characteristic optical emission spectrum from anatase TiO2. Critically, this growth and annealing process maintains the low surface roughness required for nanophotonic integration. Finally, we interface Er ensembles with high quality factor Si nanophotonic cavities via evanescent coupling and demonstrate a large Purcell enhancement (approximate to 300) of their optical lifetime. Our findings demonstrate a low-temperature, nondestructive, and substrate-independent process for integrating Er-doped materials with silicon photonics. At high doping densities this platform can enable integrated photonic components such as on-chip amplifiers and lasers, while dilute concentrations can realize single ion quantum memories.

TI Harnessing Quantum Entanglement and Fidelity in Hydrogen Atoms:
   Unveiling Dynamics Under Dephasing Noise
SO APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL
AB We investigate the quantum dynamics of entanglement and fidelity in the hyperfine structure of hydrogen atoms under dephasing noise, modeled via the Lindblad master equation. The effective Hamiltonian captures the spin-spin interaction between the electron and proton, with dephasing incorporated through local Lindblad operators. Analytical solutions for the time-dependent density matrix are derived for various initial states, including separable, partially entangled, and maximally entangled configurations. Entanglement is quantified using the concurrence, while fidelity measures the similarity between the evolving state and the initial state. Numerical results demonstrate that entanglement exhibits oscillatory decay modulated by the dephasing rate, with anti-parallel spin states displaying greater robustness compared to parallel configurations, often leading to entanglement sudden death. Fidelity dynamics reveal similar damped oscillations, underscoring the interplay between coherent hyperfine evolution and environmental dephasing. These insights elucidate strategies for preserving quantum correlations in atomic systems, with implications for quantum information processing and metrology.

TI Timing and synchronisation for high-loss free-space quantum
   communication with Hybrid de Bruijn Codes
SO IET QUANTUM COMMUNICATION
AB Satellite-based, long-distance free-space quantum key distribution has the potential to realise global quantum secure communication networks. Detecting faint quantum optical pulses sent from space requires highly accurate and robust classical timing systems to pick out signals from the noise and allow for reconciliation of sent and received key bits. For such high-loss applications, a fault-tolerant synchronisation signal coding and decoding scheme based on de Bruijn sequences is proposed. A representative synchronisation timing system was tested in laboratory conditions and it demonstrated high fault tolerance for the error-correction algorithm even under high loss. The performance limitations of this solution are also discussed, and the maximum error tolerance of the scheme and the estimated computational overhead are analysed, allowing for the possibility of implementation on a real-time system-on-chip. This solution not only can be used for synchronisation of high-loss channels such as channels between satellites and ground stations but can also be extended to applications with low loss, high bit error rate, but require reliable synchronisation such as quantum and non-quantum communications over terrestrial free space or fibre optic channels.

TI A Toolchain for Assisting Migration of Software Executables Towards
   Post-Quantum Cryptography
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB Quantum computing poses a significant global threat to modern security mechanisms. As such, security experts and public sectors have issued guidelines to help organizations transition their software to post-quantum cryptography (PQC). However, there is a lack of (semi-)automatic tools to support this transition, particularly for software deployed as binary executables. To address this gap, in this work, we first propose a set of requirements necessary for this type of tool to detect quantum-vulnerable software executables. Following these requirements, we introduce QED : a toolchain for Quantum-vulnerable Executable Detection. QED uses a three-phase approach to identify quantum-vulnerable dependencies in a given set of executables, from file-level to API-level, and finally, precise identification of a static trace that triggers a quantum-vulnerable API. The key benefit of this design is that it provides efficiency without compromising accuracy, as it incorporates fast initial analyses to filter out executables unlikely to be quantum-vulnerable that in turn allows the more resource-intensive analysis to be performed on a smaller subset of executables. To demonstrate this claim, we evaluate QED on both a synthetic dataset with four cryptography libraries and a real-world dataset with over 200 software executables. The results show that: 1)QED discerns quantum-vulnerable from quantum-safe executables with 100% accuracy in the synthetic dataset; 2) QED is practical and scalable, completing analyses on average in less than 4 seconds per real-world executable; and 3) QED reduces the manual workload required by analysts to identify quantum-vulnerable executables in the real-world dataset by more than 90%.

TI Quantum entanglement network enabled by a state-multiplexing quantum
   light source
SO LIGHT-SCIENCE & APPLICATIONS
AB A fully connected quantum network with a wavelength division multiplexing architecture plays an increasingly pivotal role in quantum information technology. With such architecture, an entanglement-based network has been demonstrated in which an entangled photon-pair source distributes quantum entanglement resources to many users. Despite these remarkable advances, the scalability of the architecture could be constrained by the finite spectrum resource, where ON2\documentclass[12pt]{minimal} \usepackage{amsmath} \usepackage{wasysym} \usepackage{amsfonts} \usepackage{amssymb} \usepackage{amsbsy} \usepackage{mathrsfs} \usepackage{upgreek} \setlength{\oddsidemargin}{-69pt} \begin{document}$${\mathscr{O}}\left({N}<^>{2}\right)$$\end{document} wavelength channels are needed to connect N users, thus impeding further progress in real-world scenarios. Here, we propose a scheme for the wavelength division multiplexing entanglement-based network using a state-multiplexing quantum light source. With a dual-pump configuration, the feasibility of our approach is demonstrated by generating state-multiplexing photon pairs at multiple wavelength channels with a silicon nitride microring resonator chip. In our demonstration, we establish a fully connected graph between four users with six wavelength channels-saving half of which without sacrificing functionality and performance of the secure communication. A total asymptotic secure key rate of 1946.9 bps is obtained by performing the BBM92 protocol with the distributed state. The network topology of our method has great potential for developing a scalable quantum network with significantly minimized infrastructure requirements.

TI Predicting properties of quantum systems by regression on a quantum
   computer
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Quantum computers can be considered as a natural means for performing machine learning tasks for inherently quantum labeled data. Many quantum machine learning techniques have been developed for solving classification problems, such as distinguishing between phases of matter or quantum processes. Similarly, one can consider a more general problem of regression, when the aim is to predict continuous labels quantifying properties of quantum states, such as purity or entanglement. In this work, we propose a method for predicting such properties. The method is based on the notion of parametrized quantum circuits, and it seeks to find an observable the expectation of which gives the prediction of the property of interest with a low variance. We numerically test our approach in learning to predict (i) the parameter of a parametrized channel given its output state, (ii) entanglement of two-qubit states, and (iii) the parameter of a parametrized Hamiltonian given its ground state. The results show that the proposed method is able to find observables such that they provide highly accurate predictions of the considered properties, and in some cases even saturate the Cramer-Rao bound, which characterizes the prediction error. We also compare our method with the Bayesian approach, and find that the latter prefers to minimize the prediction variance, having therefore a larger bias.

TI Provably Trainable Rotationally Equivariant Quantum Machine Learning
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB Exploiting the power of quantum computation to realize superior machine learning algorithms has been a major research focus of recent years, but the prospects of quantum machine learning (QML) remain dampened by considerable technical challenges. A particularly significant issue is that generic QML models suffer from so-called barren plateaus in their training landscapes-large regions where cost function gradients vanish exponentially in the number of qubits employed, rendering large models effectively untrainable. A leading strategy for combating this effect is to build problem-specific models that take into account the symmetries of their data in order to focus on a smaller, relevant subset of Hilbert space. In this work, we introduce a family of rotationally equivariant QML models built upon the quantum Fourier transform, and leverage recent insights from the Lie-algebraic study of QML models to prove that (a subset of) our models do not exhibit barren plateaus. In addition to our analytical results we numerically test our rotationally equivariant models on a dataset of simulated scanning tunneling microscope images of phosphorus impurities in silicon, where rotational symmetry naturally arises, and find that they dramatically outperform their generic counterparts in practice.

TI Qubit Condensation for Assessing Efficacy of Molecular Simulation on
   Quantum Computers
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY A
AB Quantum computersmay demonstrate significant advantages over classicaldevices, as they are able to exploit a purely quantum-mechanical phenomenonknown as entanglement in which a single quantum state simultaneouslypopulates two-or-more classical configurations. However, due to environmentalnoise and device errors, elaborate quantum entanglement can be difficultto prepare on modern quantum computers. In this paper, we introducea metric based on the condensation of qubits to assess the abilityof a quantum device to simulate many-electron systems. Qubit condensationoccurs when the qubits on a quantum computer condense into a single,highly correlated particle-hole state. While conventional metricslike gate errors and quantum volume do not directly target entanglement,the qubit-condensation metric measures the quantum computer'sability to generate an entangled state that achieves nonclassicallong-range order across the device. To demonstrate, we prepare qubitcondensations on various quantum devices and probe the degree to whichqubit condensation is realized via postmeasurement analysis. We showthat the predicted ranking of the quantum devices is consistent withthe errors obtained from molecular simulations of H-2 usinga contracted quantum eigensolver.

TI Reordering and Partitioning of Distributed Quantum Circuits
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB A new approach to reduce the teleportation cost and execution time in Distributed Quantum Circuits (DQCs) was proposed in the present paper. DQCs, a well-known solution, have been applied to solve the problem of maintaining a large number of qubits next to each other. In the distributed quantum system, the qubits are transferred to another subsystem by a quantum protocol like teleportation. Hence, a novel method was proposed to optimize the number of teleportation and to reduce the execution time for generating DQC. To this end, first, the quantum circuit was reordered according to the qubits placement to improve the computational execution time, and then the quantum circuit was modeled as a graph. Finally, we combined the genetic algorithm (GA) and the modified tabu search algorithm (MTS) to partition the graph model in order to obtain a distributed quantum circuit aimed at reducing the number of teleportation costs. A significant reduction in teleportation cost (TC) and execution time (ET) was obtained in benchmark circuits. In particular, we performed a more accurate optimization than the previous approaches, and the proposed approach yielded the best results for several benchmark circuits.

TI Stabilization of discrete time-crystalline response on a superconducting
   quantum computer by increasing the interaction range
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB The simulation of complex quantum many-body systems is a promising short-term goal of noisy intermediatescale quantum (NISQ) devices. However, the limited connectivity of native qubits hinders the implementation of quantum algorithms that require long-range interactions. We present the outcomes of a digital quantum simulation where we overcome the limitations of the qubit connectivity in NISQ devices. Utilizing the universality of quantum processor native gates, we demonstrate how to implement couplings among physically disconnected qubits at the cost of increasing the circuit depth. We apply this method to simulate a Floquet-driven quantum spin chain featuring interactions beyond nearest neighbors. Specifically, we benchmark the prethermal stabilization of the discrete Floquet time-crystalline response as the interaction range increases, a phenomenon never observed experimentally. Our quantum simulation addresses one of the significant limitations of superconducting quantum processors, namely, device connectivity. It reveals that nontrivial physics involving couplings beyond nearest neighbors can be extracted after the impact of noise is properly taken into account in the theoretical model and consequently mitigated from the experimental data.

In this survey, we highlight the motivation and the status of QSDC research with special emphasis on its theoretical basis and experimental verification. We will detail the associated point-to-point communication protocols and show how information is protected and transmitted. Finally, we discuss the open challenges as well as the future trends of QSDC networks, emphasizing again that QSDC is not a pure quantum key distribution (QKD) protocol, but a fully-fledged secure communication scheme.

TI MAQA: a quantum framework for supervised learning
SO QUANTUM INFORMATION PROCESSING
AB Quantum machine learning has the potential to improve traditional machine learning methods and overcome some of the main limitations imposed by the classical computing paradigm. However, the practical advantages of using quantum resources to solve pattern recognition tasks are still to be demonstrated. This work proposes a universal, efficient framework that can reproduce the output of a plethora of classical supervised machine learning algorithms exploiting quantum computation's advantages. The proposed framework is named Multiple Aggregator Quantum Algorithm (MAQA) due to its capability to combine multiple and diverse functions to solve typical supervised learning problems. In its general formulation, MAQA can be potentially adopted as the quantum counterpart of all those models falling into the scheme of aggregation of multiple functions, such as ensemble algorithms and neural networks. From a computational point of view, the proposed framework allows generating an exponentially large number of different transformations of the input at the cost of increasing the depth of the corresponding quantum circuit linearly. Thus, MAQA produces a model with substantial descriptive power to broaden the horizon of possible applications of quantum machine learning with a computational advantage over classical methods. As a second meaningful addition, we discuss the adoption of the proposed framework as hybrid quantum-classical and fault-tolerant quantum algorithm.

TI Charged particle tracking with quantum annealing optimization
SO QUANTUM MACHINE INTELLIGENCE
AB At the High Luminosity Large Hadron Collider (HL-LHC), traditional track reconstruction techniques that are critical for physics analysis will need to be upgraded to scale with track density. Quantum annealing has shown promise in its ability to solve combinatorial optimization problems amidst an ongoing effort to establish evidence of a quantum speedup. As a step towards exploiting such potential speedup, we investigate a track reconstruction approach by adapting the existing geometric Denby-Peterson (Hopfield) network method to the quantum annealing framework for HL-LHC conditions. We develop additional techniques to embed the problem onto existing and near-term quantum annealing hardware. Results using simulated annealing and quantum annealing with the D-Wave 2X system on the TrackML open dataset are presented, demonstrating the successful application of a quantum annealing algorithm to the track reconstruction challenge. We find that combinatorial optimization problems can effectively reconstruct tracks, suggesting possible applications for fast hardware-specific implementations at the HL-LHC while leaving open the possibility of a quantum speedup for tracking.

TI Quantum simulation of Lindbladian dynamics via repeated interactions
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICS A-MATHEMATICAL AND THEORETICAL
AB The Lindblad equation generalizes the Schr & ouml;dinger equation to quantum systems that undergo dissipative dynamics. The quantum simulation of Lindbladian dynamics is therefore non-unitary, preventing a naive application of state-of-the-art quantum algorithms. Here, we make use of an approximate correspondence between Lindbladian dynamics and evolution based on repeated interaction (RI) CPTP maps to write down a Hamiltonian formulation of the Lindblad dynamics and derive a rigorous error bound on the master equation. Specifically, we show that the number of interactions needed to simulate the Liouvillian e(tL) within error & varepsilon; scales in most physical scenarios as nu is an element of O(t(2)parallel to L parallel to(2)(1 -> 1)/& varepsilon;). This is significant because the error in the Lindbladian approximation to the dynamics is not explicitly bounded in existing quantum algorithms for open system simulations. We then provide quantum algorithms to simulate RI maps using an iterative qubitization approach and Trotter-Suzuki formulas, and specifically show that for iterative qubitization the number of operations needed to simulate the dynamics (for a fixed value of nu) scales as O(alpha(0)t + nu log(1/& varepsilon;)/ log log(1/& varepsilon;)) in the limit where alpha 0 (the coefficient 1-norm for the system and bath Hamiltonians) asymptotically dominates over the corresponding factor for the interaction Hamiltonian, which is often the case in weak coupling. This scaling would appear to be optimal if the complexity of nu is not considered, which underscores the importance of considering the error in the Liouvillian that we reveal in this work.

TI Procedure via cross-Kerr nonlinearities for encoding single logical
   qubit information onto four-photon decoherence-free states
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB We propose a photonic procedure using cross-Kerr nonlinearities (XKNLs) to encode single logical qubit information onto four-photon decoherence-free states. In quantum information processing, a decoherence-free subspace can secure quantum information against collective decoherence. Therefore, we design a procedure employing nonlinear optical gates, which are composed of XKNLs, quantum bus beams, and photon-number-resolving measurements with linear optical devices, to conserve quantum information by encoding quantum information onto four-photon decoherence-free states (single logical qubit information). Based on our analysis in quantifying the affection (photon loss and dephasing) of the decoherence effect, we demonstrate the experimental condition to acquire the reliable procedure of single logical qubit information having the robustness against the decoherence effect.

TI Quantum computing for extracting nuclear resonances
SO PHYSICS LETTERS B
AB Quantum computing has been increasingly applied in nuclear physics. In this work, we combine quantum computing with the complex scaling method to address the resonance problem. Due to the non-Hermiticity introduced by complex scaling, standard quantum computing cannot solve for complex eigenvalues directly. Therefore, it is necessary to embed the non-Hermitian operator into a larger dimensional unitary operator. Additionally, for the case of two basis vectors, we improve the traditional direct measurement method and optimize the quantum circuit. Ultimately, using the alpha + alpha system as an example, we obtain the complex eigenenergies from the quantum computer that are consistent with those obtained from direct Hamiltonian diagonalization.

TI Non-classical mechanical states guided in a phononic waveguide
SO NATURE PHYSICS
AB Non-classical vibrations are generated and transmitted along a mechanical waveguide, providing a platform for distributing quantum information and realizing hybrid quantum devices using phonons in a solid-state system.
   The ability to create, manipulate and detect non-classical states of light has been key for many recent achievements in quantum physics and for developing quantum technologies. Achieving the same level of control over phonons, the quanta of vibrations, could have a similar impact, in particular on the fields of quantum sensing and quantum information processing. Here we present a crucial step towards this level of control and realize a single-mode waveguide for individual phonons in a suspended silicon microstructure. We use a cavity-waveguide architecture, where the cavity is used as a source and detector for the mechanical excitations while the waveguide has a free-standing end to reflect the phonons. This enables us to observe multiple round trips of phonons between the source and the reflector. The long mechanical lifetime of almost 100 mu s demonstrates the possibility of nearly lossless transmission of single phonons over, in principle, tens of centimetres. Our experiment demonstrates full on-chip control over travelling single phonons strongly confined in the directions transverse to the propagation axis, potentially enabling a time-encoded multimode quantum memory at telecommunications wavelength and advanced quantum acoustics experiments.

TI Blind three-qubit exact Grover search on a nitrogen-vacancy-center
   platform
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Here we put into practice the concept of blind client-server quantum computation, in which a client with limited quantum power controls the execution of a quantum computation on a powerful server, without revealing any details of the computation. In particular, it is a three-node setting in which an oracular quantum computation can be executed blindly. In this Blind Oracular Quantum Computation (BOQC), the oracle (Oscar) is another node, with limited power, who acts in cooperation with the client (Alice) to supply quantum information to the server so that the oracle part of the quantum computation can also be executed blindly. We develop tests of this protocol using two- and three-qubit versions of the exact Grover algorithm (i.e., with database sizes 4 <= N <= 8), obtaining optimal implementations of these algorithms within a gate array scheme and the blinded cluster-state scheme. We discuss the feasibility of executing these protocols in state-of-the-art three-node experiments using nitrogen-vacancy diamond electronic and nuclear qubits.

TI Classification and quantification of entanglement through wedge product
   and geometry
SO PHYSICA SCRIPTA
AB The wedge product of post-measurement vectors of a two-qubit state gives rise to a parallelogram, whose 'area' has been shown to be equivalent to the generalized I-concurrence measure of entanglement. In multi-qudit systems, the wedge product of post-measurement vectors naturally leads to a higher dimensional parallelepiped which yields a modified faithful entanglement measure. Our new measure fine grains the entanglement monotone, wherein different entangled classes manifest with different geometries. We present a complete analysis of the bipartite qutrit case considering all possible geometric structures where three entanglement classes of pure bipartite qutrit states can be identified with different geometries of post-measurement vectors: three planar vectors; three mutually orthogonal vectors; and three vectors that are neither planar and not all of them are mutually orthogonal. It is further demonstrated that the geometric condition of area and volume maximization naturally leads to the maximization of entanglement. The wedge product approach uncovers an inherent geometry of entanglement and is found to be very useful for the characterization and quantification of entanglement in higher dimensional systems.

TI Magic state distillation and cost analysis in fault-tolerant universal
   quantum computation
SO QUANTUM SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB Magic states have been widely studied in recent years as resource states that help quantum computers achieve fault-tolerant universal quantum computing. The fault-tolerant quantum computing requires fault-tolerant implementation of a set of universal logical gates. Stabilizer code, as a commonly used error correcting code with good properties, can apply the Clifford gates transversally which is fault tolerant. But only Clifford gates cannot realize universal computation. Magic states are introduced to construct non-Clifford gates that combine with Clifford operations to achieve universal quantum computing. Since the preparation of quantum states is inevitably accompanied by noise, preparing the magic state with high fidelity and low overhead is the crucial problem to realizing universal quantum computation. In this paper, we survey the related literature in the past 20 years and introduce the common types of magic states, the protocols to obtain high-fidelity magic states, and overhead analysis for these protocols. Finally, we discuss the future directions of this field.

TI Security Proof Against Collective Attacks for an Experimentally Feasible
   Semiquantum Key Distribution Protocol
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON QUANTUM ENGINEERING
AB Semiquantum key distribution (SQKD) allows two parties (Alice and Bob) to create a shared secret key, even if one of these parties (say, Alice) is classical. However, most SQKD protocols suffer from severe practical security problems when implemented using photons. The recently developed "Mirror protocol" (Boyer, Katz, Liss, and Mor, 2017) is an experimentally feasible SQKD protocol overcoming those drawbacks. The Mirror protocol was proven robust (namely, it was proven secure against a limited class of attacks including all noiseless attacks), but its security in case some noise is allowed (natural or due to eavesdropping) has not been proved yet. Here, we prove the security of the Mirror protocol against a wide class of quantum attacks ("collective attacks"), and we evaluate the allowed noise threshold and the resulting key rate.

TI Photonic Implementation of Quantum Information Masking
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB Masking of quantum information spreads it over nonlocal correlations and hides it from the subsystems. It is known that no operation can simultaneously mask all pure states [Phys. Rev. Lett. 120, 230501 (2018)], so in what sense is quantum information masking useful? Here, we extend the definition of quantum information masking to general mixed states, and show that the resource of maskable quantum states is far more abundant than the no-go theorem seemingly suggests. Geometrically, the simultaneously maskable states lays on hyperdisks in the state hypersphere, and strictly contains the broadcastable states. We devise a photonic quantum information masking machine using time-correlated photons to experimentally investigate the properties of qubit masking, and demonstrate the transfer of quantum information into bipartite correlations and its faithful retrieval. The versatile masking machine has decent extensibility, and may be applicable to quantum secret sharing and fault-tolerant quantum communication. Our results provide some insights on the comprehension and potential application of quantum information masking.

TI Variationally scheduled quantum simulation
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Eigenstate preparation is ubiquitous in quantum computing, and a standard approach for generating the lowest-energy states of a given system is by employing adiabatic state preparation (ASP). In the present work, we investigate a variational method for determining the optimal scheduling procedure within the context of ASP. In the absence of quantum error correction, running a quantum device for any meaningful amount of time causes a system to become susceptible to the loss of relevant information. Therefore, if accurate quantum states are to be successfully generated, it is crucial to find techniques that shorten the time of individual runs during iterations of annealing. We demonstrate our variational method toward this end by investigating the hydrogen and P4 molecules, as well as the Ising model problem on a two-dimensional triangular lattice. In both cases, the time required for one iteration to produce accurate results is reduced by several orders of magnitude in comparison to what is achievable via standard ASP. The significant shortening of the required time is achieved by using excited states partially during ASP. As a result, the required quantum coherence time to perform such a calculation on a quantum device becomes much less stringent with the implementation of this algorithm. In addition, our variational method is found to exhibit resilience against control errors, which are commonly encountered within the realm of quantum computing.

TI Design and integration of single-qubit rotations and two-qubit gates in
   silicon above one Kelvin
SO COMMUNICATIONS MATERIALS
AB Spin qubits in quantum dots define an attractive platform for quantum information because of their compatibility with semiconductor manufacturing, their long coherence times, and the ability to operate above one Kelvin. However, despite demonstrations of SWAP oscillations, the integration of this two-qubit gate together with single-qubit control to create a universal gate set as originally proposed for single spins in quantum dots has remained elusive. Here, we show that we can overcome these limitations and execute a multitude of native two-qubit gates, together with single-qubit control, in a single device, reducing the operation overhead to perform quantum algorithms. We demonstrate single-qubit rotations, together with the two-qubit gates CROT, CPHASE, and SWAP, on a silicon double quantum dot. Furthermore, we introduce adiabatic and diabatic composite sequences that allow the execution of CPHASE and SWAP gates on the same device, despite the finite Zeeman energy difference. Both two-qubit gates can be executed in less than 100 ns and, by theoretically analyzing the experimental noise sources, we predict control fidelities exceeding 99%, even for operation above one Kelvin.
   Spin qubits are attractive for scalable quantum information, but integrating different classes of two-qubit logic has remained elusive. Here, the SWAP, CPHASE, and CNOT-class two-qubit gates are implemented in a silicon device operating even at temperatures above 1 K.

TI Compact sub-GHz bandwidth single-mode time-energy entangled photon
   source for high-speed quantum networks
SO OSA CONTINUUM
AB The potential data rate of a quantum network is limited by both the entangled photon source (EPS) and quantum memories. While an EPS whose bandwidth matches with broadband quantum memories (BBQMs) can take full advantage of the data rate limit. The EPS with GHz bandwidth is usually obtained by filtering a much broader EPS signal that is generated through spontaneous parametric down-conversion (SPDC), but this method has obvious drawbacks, e.g., large space requirements, high losses, and relatively low spectral brightness. Here we present a simple and compact method to generate a single-longitudinal-mode sub-GHz-bandwidth time-energy EPS using a type-II SPDC in a submillimeter-length Fabry-Perot cavity. The proposed photon source offers superior figures of merit: the maximum coincidence to accidental coincidence ratio is approximately 1800, the detected pair flux ranges up to 42500 pairs per second, and the source has a high Klyshko efficiency of 25%. This source offers a very potential way to boost the performance of broadband quantum memories and high-speed quantum networks.

TI Rapid on-demand generation of thermal states in superconducting quantum
   circuits
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB We experimentally demonstrate the fast generation of thermal states of a transmon using a single-junction quantum-circuit refrigerator (QCR) as an in situ tunable environment. Through single-shot readout, we monitor the transmon up to its third excited state, assessing population distributions controlled by QCR drive pulses. Whereas cooling can be achieved in the weak-drive regime, high-amplitude pulses can generate Boltzmanndistributed populations from a temperature of 110 mK up to 500 mK within 100 ns. As we propose in our work, this fast and efficient temperature control provides an appealing opportunity to demonstrate a quantum heat engine. Our results also pave the way for efficient dissipative state preparation and for reducing the circuit depth in thermally assisted quantum algorithms and quantum annealing.

TI Shallow quantum circuits for deeper problems
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB State-of-the-art quantum computers can only reliably execute circuits with limited qubit numbers and computational depth. This severely reduces the scope of algorithms that can be run. While numerous techniques have been invented to exploit few-qubit devices, corresponding schemes for depth -limited computations are less explored. This work investigates to what extent we can mimic the performance of a deeper quantum computation by repeatedly using a shallower device. We propose a method for this purpose, inspired by Feynman simulation, where a given circuit is chopped into two pieces. The first piece is executed and measured early on, and the second piece is run based on the previous outcome. This method is inefficient if applied in a straightforward manner due to the high number of possible outcomes. To mitigate this issue, we propose a shallow variational circuit, whose purpose is to maintain the complexity of the method within predefined tolerable limits, and provide an optimization method to find such a circuit. The composition of these components of the methods is called "reduce&chop." As we discuss, this approach works for certain cases of interest. We believe this work may stimulate new research towards exploiting the potential of shallow quantum computers.

TI Generation of macroscopic entanglement in ensemble systems based on
   silicon vacancy centers
SO CHINESE PHYSICS B
AB Entanglement in macroscopic systems, as a fundamental quantum resource, has been utilized to propel the advancement of quantum technology and probe the boundary between the quantum and classical realms. This study focuses on a unique hybrid quantum system comprising of an ensemble of silicon vacancy (SiV) centers coupled to phononic waveguides in diamond via strain interactions. By employing two sets of time-dependent, non-overlapping driving fields, we investigate the generation process and dynamic properties of macroscopic quantum entanglement, providing fresh insights into the behavior of such hybrid quantum systems. Furthermore, it paves the way for new possibilities in utilizing quantum entanglement as an information carrier in quantum information processing and quantum communication.

TI Scalable Bell inequalities for graph states of arbitrary prime local
   dimension and self-testing
SO NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB Bell nonlocality-the existence of quantum correlations that cannot be explained by classical means-is certainly one of the most striking features of quantum mechanics. Its range of applications in device-independent protocols is constantly growing. Many relevant quantum features can be inferred from violations of Bell inequalities, including entanglement detection and quantification, and state certification applicable to systems of arbitrary number of particles. A complete characterisation of nonlocal correlations for many-body systems is, however, a computationally intractable problem. Even if one restricts the analysis to specific classes of states, no general method to tailor Bell inequalities to be violated by a given state is known. In this work we provide a general construction of Bell expressions tailored to the graph states of any prime local dimension. These form a broad class of multipartite quantum states that have many applications in quantum information, including quantum error correction. We analytically determine their maximal quantum values, a number of high relevance for device-independent applications of Bell inequalities. Importantly, the number of expectation values to determine in order to test the violation of our inequalities scales only linearly with the system size, which we expect to be the optimal scaling one can hope for in this case. Finally, we show that these inequalities can be used for self-testing of multi-qutrit graph states such as the well-known four-qutrit absolutely maximally entangled state AME(4,3).

TI Building spatial symmetries into parameterized quantum circuits for
   faster training
SO QUANTUM SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB Practical success of quantum learning models hinges on having a suitable structure for the parameterized quantum circuit. Such structure is defined both by the types of gates employed and by the correlations of their parameters. While much research has been devoted to devising adequate gate-sets, typically respecting some symmetries of the problem, very little is known about how their parameters should be structured. In this work, we show that an ideal parameter structure naturally emerges when carefully considering spatial symmetries (i.e. the symmetries that are permutations of parts of the system under study). Namely, we consider the automorphism group of the problem Hamiltonian, leading us to develop a circuit construction that is equivariant under this symmetry group. The benefits of our novel circuitstructure, called ORB, are numerically probed in several ground-state problems. We find a consistent improvement (in terms of circuit depth, number of parameters required, and gradient magnitudes) compared to literature circuit constructions.

SO PHYSICA SCRIPTA
AB We examine information loss, resource costs, and run time from practical application of quantum data compression. Compressing quantum data to fewer qubits enables efficient use of resources, as well as applications for quantum communication and denoising. In this context, we provide a description of the quantum and classical components of the hybrid quantum autoencoder algorithm, implemented using IBMs Qiskit language. Utilizing our own data sets, we encode bitmap images as quantum superposition states, which correspond to linearly independent vectors with density matrices of discrete values. We successfully compress this data with near-lossless compression using simulation, and then run our algorithm on an IBMQ quantum chip. We describe conditions and run times for training and compressing our data on quantum devices, and relate trainability to specific characteristics and performance metrics of our parametric quantum circuits.

TI Two-Level-System Dynamics in a Superconducting Qubit Due to Background
   Ionizing Radiation
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB Superconducting qubit lifetimes must be both long and stable to provide an adequate foundation for quantum computing. This stability is imperiled by two-level systems (TLSs), currently a dominant loss mechanism, which exhibit slow spectral dynamics that destabilize qubit lifetimes on hour time scales. Stability is also threatened at millisecond time scales, where ionizing radiation has recently been found to cause bursts of correlated multiqubit decays, complicating quantum error correction. Here, we study both ionizing radiation and TLS dynamics on a 27-qubit processor, repurposing the standard transmon qubits as sensors of both radiation impacts and TLS dynamics. Unlike prior literature, we observe resilience of the qubit lifetimes to the transient quasiparticles generated by the impact of radiation. However, we also observe a new interaction between these two processes, "TLS scrambling," in which a radiation impact causes multiple TLSs to jump in frequency, which we suggest is due to the same charge rearrangement sensed by qubits near a radiation impact. As TLS scrambling brings TLSs out of or into resonance with the qubit, the lifetime of the qubit increases or decreases. Our findings thus identify radiation as a new contribution to fluctuations in qubit lifetimes, with implications for efforts to characterize and improve device stability.

SO QUANTUM INFORMATION PROCESSING
AB We use quantum computers to test the foundations of quantum mechanics through quantum algorithms that implement some of the experimental tests as the basis of the theory's postulates. These algorithms can be used as a test of the physical theory under the premise of perfect hardware or as a test of the hardware under the premise that quantum theory is correct. In this work, we show how the algorithms can be used to test the efficacy of a quantum computer in obeying the postulates of quantum mechanics. We study the effect of different types of noise on the results of experimental tests of the postulates. A salient feature of this noise analysis is that it is deeply rooted in the fundamentals of quantum mechanics as it highlights how systematic errors affect the quantumness of the quantum computer.

TI Energy Consumption Framework and Analysis of Post-Quantum Key-Generation

SO JOURNAL OF CYBERSECURITY AND PRIVACY
AB The emergence of quantum computing and Shor's algorithm necessitates an imminent shift from current public key cryptography techniques to post-quantum-robust techniques. The NIST has responded by standardising Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC) algorithms, with ML-KEM (FIPS-203) slated to replace ECDH (Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman) for key exchange. A key practical concern for PQC adoption is energy consumption. This paper introduces a new framework for measuring PQC energy consumption on a Raspberry Pi when performing key generation. The framework uses both the available traditional methods and the newly standardised ML-KEM algorithm via the commonly utilised OpenSSL library.

TI Bounds on concatenated entanglement-assisted quantum error-correcting
   codes
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Code concatenation combines two or more component codes to design larger codes with greater noise resilience. Introducing entanglement assistance to concatenated codes provides a further advantage in terms of improved error rates and beating certain bounds on codes that would otherwise be unbeatable. First, we derive the general expression for the shared entanglement of a concatenated code and show that the number of ebits can depend on the order of concatenating the component entanglement-assisted quantum error-correcting codes (EAQECCs). We further construct families of pairs of EAQECCs such that the number of ebits of the resultant of concatenating the two codes in a given pair is order independent. Second, we derive conditions on code distance under which nonmaximal-entanglement EAQECCs obtained from a classical quaternary Griesmer or Plotkin code saturate the entanglement-assisted (EA) Griesmer or linear EA Plotkin bound, respectively, extending the known result for maximal-entanglement EAQECCs. Furthermore, we present several families of such nonmaximal-entanglement EAQECCs. Third, we derive an EA version of the quantum Griesmer-Rains bound on the number of correctable errors for EAQECCs. Finally, we present families of pairs of EAQECCs such that the violation of the EA Hamming bound by the resultant of concatenating the two codes in a given pair is order dependent.

TI Inferred-variance uncertainty relations in the presence of quantum
   entanglement
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Uncertainty relations play a significant role in drawing a line between classical physics and quantum physics. Since the introduction by Heisenberg, these relations have been considerably explored. However, the effect of quantum entanglement on uncertainty relations was not probed. Berta et al. [Nat. Phys. 6, 659 (2010)] removed this gap by deriving a conditional-entropic uncertainty relation in the presence of quantum entanglement. In the same spirit, using inferred-variance, we formulate uncertainty relations in the presence of entanglement for general two-qubit systems and arbitrary observables. We derive lower bounds for the sum and product inferred-variance uncertainty relations. Strikingly, we can write the lower bounds of these inferred-variance uncertainty relations in terms of measures of entanglement of two-qubit states, as characterized by concurrence, or G function. The presence of entanglement in the lower bound of inferred-variance uncertainty relation is quite distinctive. We also explore the violation of local uncertainty relations in this context and an interference experiment. Furthermore, we discuss possible applications of these uncertainty relations.

TI Suppressing chaos with mixed superconducting-qubit devices
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW APPLIED
AB In quantum information processing, a tension between two different tasks occurs: while qubits' states can be preserved by one isolating them, quantum gates can be realized only through qubit-qubit interactions. In arrays of qubits, weak coupling leads to states being spatially localized and strong coupling leads to delocalized states. Here we study the average energy level spacing and the relative entropy of the distribution of the level spacings (Kullback-Leibler divergence from Poisson distribution and Gaussian orthogonal ensemble) to analyze the crossover between localized and delocalized (chaotic) regimes in linear arrays of superconducting qubits. We consider both transmons and capacitively shunted flux qubits, which enables us to tune the qubit anharmonicity. Arrays with uniform anharmonicity, comprising only transmons or flux qubits, display remarkably similar dependencies of level statistics on the coupling strength. In systems with alternating anharmonicity, for typical disorder in the qubit frequencies the localized regime is found to be more resilient to the increase in qubit-qubit coupling strength in comparison with arrays with a single qubit type. Our results, which we also confirm using generalized Bose-Hubbard models, support the design of devices that incorporate different qubit types to achieve higher performances.

TI Quantum Security Threat Discovery: A Value Sensitive Design Approach to
   Discovering Security Risks of Quantum Sensing at the Port of Moerdijk
SO NANOETHICS
AB This paper investigates the application of Security Threat Discovery Cards (STDCs) for identifying security risks in quantum sensing technologies within port security contexts. With the advent of quantum technologies, organizations and stakeholders face the challenge to explore and assess the impact of the applications these technologies will bring. This exploration faces the perceived incomprehensibility of quantum technologies, and suggests a preliminary step aimed at understanding these technologies. Our results suggest that organizations and companies considering the application of quantum technology can skip this preliminary step and independently identify their main risks of quantum applications in a nuanced manner. Our case is an exploration of quantum sensing application by Port security personnel with the STDCs. The research consisted of two independent empirical studies: a workshop with Port of Moerdijk personnel using STDCs and semi-structured interviews with security experts. The comparative analysis of the findings from these studies demonstrates the STDCs' efficacy in revealing with the Port's personnel assessment of nuanced risks beyond the experts' foresight. For example, the interviews with experts raised concerns regarding governance, ethical implications, and the human factor in quantum technology integration. The workshop with personnel not only suggested similar concerns but also uncovered additional risks, including socio-technical threats and broader societal impacts.

AB Quantum computing has the potential for disruptive change in many sectors of industry, especially in materials science and optimization. In this paper, we describe how the turbine balancing problem can be solved with quantum computing, which is the NPhard optimization problem of analytically balancing rotor blades in a single plane as found in turbine assembly. Small yet relevant instances occur in industry, which makes the problem interesting for early quantum computing benchmarks. We model it as a quadratic unconstrained binary optimization problem and compare the performance of a classical rule-based heuristic and D-Wave Systems' quantum annealer Advantage_system4.1. In this case study, we use real-world as well as synthetic datasets and observe that the quantum hardware significantly improves an actively used heuristic's solution for small-scale problem instances with bare disk imbalance in terms of solution quality. Motivated by this performance gain, we subsequently design a quantum-inspired classical heuristic based on simulated annealing that achieves very good results on all given problem instances, essentially solving the optimization problem sufficiently well for all considered datasets, according to industrial requirements.

Concretely, we study a four-site Hubbard ring that exhibits a transition from a product state to an intrinsically interacting ground state as hopping amplitudes are changed. We locate this transition and solve for the ground-state energy with high quantitative accuracy using a variational quantum algorithm executed on an IBM quantum computer. Our results are enabled by a variational ansatz that takes full advantage of the maximal set of commuting Z(2) symmetries of the problem and a Lanczos-inspired error mitigation algorithm. They are a benchmark on the way to exploiting near term quantum simulators for quantum many-body problems.

TI Analysis of multiple overlapping paths algorithms for secure key
   exchange in large-scale quantum networks
SO JOURNAL OF INFORMATION SECURITY AND APPLICATIONS
AB Quantum networks open the way to an unprecedented level of communication security. However, due to physical limitations on the distances of quantum links, current implementations of quantum networks are unavoidably equipped with trusted nodes. Consequently, the quantum key distribution can be performed only on the links. Due to this, some new authentication and key exchange schemes must be considered to fully benefit from the unconditional security of the links. One such approach uses Multiple Non-Overlapping Paths (MNOPs) for key exchange to mitigate the risk of an attack on a trusted node. The scope of the article is to perform a security analysis of this scheme for the case of both uncorrelated attacks and correlated attacks with finite resources. Furthermore, our analysis is extended to the case of Multiple Overlapping Paths (MOPs). We prove that introducing overlapping paths allows one to increase the security of the protocol, compared to the non-overlapping case with the same number of additional links added. This result may find application in optimising architectures of large-scale (hybrid) quantum networks.

TI <hr>Potential of quantum machine learning for processing multispectral
   Earth observation data
SO BULLETIN OF THE POLISH ACADEMY OF SCIENCES-TECHNICAL SCIENCES
AB Quantum computers with hundreds of noisy qubits are already available for the research community. They have the potential to run complex quantum computations well beyond the computational capacity of any classical device. It is natural to ask the question, what application these devices could be useful for? Land use and land cover classification of multispectral Earth observation data collected from the earth observation satellite mission is one such problem that is hard for classical methods due to its unique characteristics. In this work, we compare the performance of several classical machine learning algorithms on the stilted re-labeled dataset of the Copernicus Sentinel-2 mission, when the algorithm has access to projected quantum kernel (PQK) features. We show that the classification accuracy increases drastically when the model has access to PQK features. We then naively study the performance of these algorithms with and without access to PQK features on the original Copernicus Sentinel-2 mission data set. This study provides key evidence that shows the potential of quantum machine learning methods for Earth observation data.

TI Steane code analysis by randomized benchmarking
SO RAIRO-OPERATIONS RESEARCH
AB Quantum error correction codes (QECC) play a fundamental role in protecting the information processed in today's noisy quantum computers. To build good error correction schemes, it is essential to understand how noise affects the behavior of these codes. In this research paper, we analyze Steane code, a 7-qubit QECC, using a randomized benchmarking (RB) protocol. With RB protocols, we can partially characterize the quality of implementation of a set of quantum gates. We show a scenario where Steane code with one logical qubit is advantageous compared to the situation with no quantum code. We obtained our results using a quantum simulator with custom noise models considering different numbers of noisy qubits.

TI Qutrit state tomography via optimal unambiguous state discrimination and
   mutually unbiased measurements
SO RESULTS IN PHYSICS
AB We propose an efficient scheme for qutrit state tomography based on optimal unambiguous discrimination of three nonorthogonal pure qutrit states. In our scheme, we first introduce an ancillary qubit initially prepared in a known state and apply a joint unitary transformation on the whole system composed of a qutrit state and an ancillary qubit state. Afterwards, we make a local von Neumann measurement (VNM) on the ancillary qubit. If it is projected onto the state vertical bar 0 vertical bar, we finally perform mutually unbiased measurements (MUMs) on the collapsed qutrit state arbitrarily chosen from a complete set of four mutually unbiased bases (MUBs). With only six properly-chosen projectors, the real and imaginary parts of non-diagonal elements can be entirely obtained. Together with the diagonal elements obtained directly from one VNM in the computational bases, the density matrix of an arbitrary unknown qutrit state can be fully determined. Compared with the previous work (R. Salazar and A. Delgado 2012), our scheme consumes much less resources. In comparison with MUBs-based tomography scheme (H. Yuan, et al., 2016), our scheme requires more measurements and less projectors, but pays the price of a loss of certain fraction identically prepared states. Our proposal can be extended to the case of other d-dimensional quantum states if their d MUBs are exactly known.

TI Optical quantum technologies with hexagonal boron nitride single photon
   sources
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB Single photon quantum emitters are important building blocks of optical quantum technologies. Hexagonal boron nitride (hBN), an atomically thin wide band gap two dimensional material, hosts robust, optically active luminescent point defects, which are known to reduce phonon lifetimes, promises as a stable single-photon source at room temperature. In this Review, we present the recent advances in hBN quantum light emission, comparisons with other 2D material based quantum sources and analyze the performance of hBN quantum emitters. We also discuss state-of-the-art stable single photon emitter's fabrication in UV, visible and near IR regions, their activation, characterization techniques, photostability towards a wide range of operating temperatures and harsh environments, Density-functional theory predictions of possible hBN defect structures for single photon emission in UV to IR regions and applications of single photon sources in quantum communication and quantum photonic circuits with associated potential obstacles.

TI Rare-earth doped yttrium silicate (Y2SiO5) thin films grown by chemical
   vapour deposition for quantum technologies
SO JOURNAL OF LUMINESCENCE
AB Yttrium orthosilicate (Y2SiO5 - YSO) is one of the most promising crystals to host rare-earth (RE) ions for quantum technologies applications. In this matrix, they indeed exhibit narrow optical and spin linewidths that can be exploited to develop quantum memories or quantum information processing capabilities. In this paper, we propose a new method to grow RE doped silicate thin films on silicon wafers based on direct liquid injection chemical vapour deposition (DLI-CVD). We optimize the deposition and annealing conditions to achieve formation of the high temperature X2-YSO phase. The phase purity and crystalline quality of the films are assessed by evaluating the optical properties of Eu3+ ions embedded in this oxide matrix. In view of the results, we discuss the possible phase formation mechanisms, and the potential of this new wafer-compatible form of YSO for quantum technologies applications.

TI Quantum computation for periodic solids in second quantization
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB In this work, we present a quantum algorithm for ground-state energy calculations of periodic solids on error -corrected quantum computers. The algorithm is based on the sparse qubitization approach in second quantization and developed for Bloch and Wannier basis sets. We show that Wannier functions require less computational resources with respect to Bloch functions because (i) the L1 norm of the Hamiltonian is considerably lower and (ii) the translational symmetry of Wannier functions can be exploited in order to reduce the amount of classical data that must be loaded into the quantum computer. The resource requirements of the quantum algorithm are estimated for periodic solids such as NiO and PdO. These transition metal oxides are industrially relevant for their catalytic properties. We find that ground-state energy estimation of Hamiltonians approximated using 200-900 spin orbitals requires ca. 1010-1012 T gates and up to 3 x 108 physical qubits for a physical error rate of 0.1%.

TI Modular chip-integrated photonic control of artificial atoms in diamond
   waveguides
SO OPTICA
AB A central goal in creating long-distance quantum networks and distributed quantum computing is the development of interconnected and individually controlled qubit nodes. Atom-like emitters in diamond have emerged as a leading system for optically networked quantum memories, motivating the development of visible-spectrum, multi-channel photonic integrated circuit (PIC) systems for scalable atom control. However, it has remained an open challenge to realize optical programmability with a qubit layer that can achieve high optical detection probability over many optical channels. Here, we address this problem by introducing a modular architecture of piezoelectrically actuated atom-control PICs (APICs) and artificial atoms embedded in diamond nanostructures designed for high-efficiency free-space collection. The high-speed four-channel APIC is based on a splitting tree mesh with triple-phase shifter Mach-Zehnder interferometers. This design simultaneously achieves optically broadband operation at visible wavelengths, high-fidelity switching (>40 dB) at low voltages, submicrosecond modulation timescales (>30 MHz), and minimal channel-to-channel crosstalk for repeatable optical pulse carving. Via a reconfigurable free- space interconnect, we use the APIC to address single silicon vacancy color centers in individual diamond waveguides with inverse tapered couplers, achieving efficient single photon detection probabilities (similar to 15%) and second-order autocorrelation measurements g((2))(0) < 0.14 for all channels. The modularity of this distributed APIC-quantum memory system simplifies the quantum control problem, potentially enabling further scaling to thousands of channels.

TI A cryogenic on-chip microwave pulse generator for large-scale
   superconducting quantum computing
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB For superconducting quantum processors, microwave signals are delivered to each qubit from room-temperature electronics to the cryogenic environment through coaxial cables. Limited by the heat load of cabling and the massive cost of electronics, such an architecture is not viable for millions of qubits required for fault-tolerant quantum computing. Monolithic integration of the control electronics and the qubits provides a promising solution, which, however, requires a coherent cryogenic microwave pulse generator that is compatible with superconducting quantum circuits. Here, we report such a signal source driven by digital-like signals, generating pulsed microwave emission with well-controlled phase, intensity, and frequency directly at millikelvin temperatures. We showcase high-fidelity readout of superconducting qubits with the microwave pulse generator. The device demonstrated here has a small footprint, negligible heat load, great flexibility to operate, and is fully compatible with today's superconducting quantum circuits, thus providing an enabling technology for large-scale superconducting quantum computers.
   Integrating a control interface with a quantum processor as the number of qubits scales is a significant challenge. Here the authors report a cryogenic on-chip microwave pulse generator for superconducting qubits with high degree of controllability, negligible heat load, and a small footprint.

TI A Concise Primer on Solid-State Quantum Emitters
SO IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN QUANTUM ELECTRONICS
AB Quantum emitters serve as essential on-demand photonic resources, generating quantum states of light such as single photons and entangled photon pairs while serving as interfaces between light and matter. Buried in the solid state, quantum emitters enable a straightforward adoption of advanced nanofabrication techniques, facilitating precise engineering of their photonic environment for scalable quantum technologies. In this review, we introduce the fundamentals of quantum emitters and the key metrics characterising their performance. We highlight three material platforms: quantum dots, defect centres in diamond, and defect centres in silicon carbide. We summarise the recent developments of these platforms and discuss their advancements in quantum applications, including quantum communication, computation, and sensing. Finally, we provide a comparison across the three platforms, along with an outlook on future directions and potential challenges.

TI Effects of ambient noise on quantum speed limit time and quantum discord
   dynamics of a double "gravitational cat state" system
SO ACTA PHYSICA SINICA
AB The exploration of the quantum nature of gravity has always been the focus of academic research. In this work, we consider a double "gravitational cat state" quantum system consisting of a pair of massive particles coupled with gravitational interaction confined in their respective double potential wells. Specifically, we model the double "gravitational cat state" system as a two-qubit system by assuming that the system is initially in the two-qubit Bell state, and investigate the effects of stable classical field and decayed field noise on the quantum speed limit time (QSLT) and trace distance discord (TDD) dynamics of the double "gravitational cat state". The results show that the QSLT can be controlled by changing the parameters of the system and the environment, and the quantum state dynamic evolution of the system with massive particles can be accelerated. The quantum state evolution can be accelerated by increasing the gravitational coupling intensity between the two massive particles. The decay rate of the decaying field can also regulate the QSLT of the system to a certain extent, so as to accelerate the quantum state evolution. Under the influence of decaying field noise, it is worth noting that the intensity of gravitational coupling affects the frequency of quantum discord oscillations in this two-particle system. The QSLT shows an oscillating trend with time: rapidly increasing to a certain value in a short period of time, then beginning to decline, and then oscillating until it reaches a stable value. That is to say, the evolution of quantum states goes through an oscillatory cycle of first deceleration and then acceleration until the evolution rate becomes stable after a certain period of time. At the same time, there are similar oscillations in the dynamics of quantum discord. Moreover, by comparing these two, it is found that the QSLT decreases in the process of increasing the quantum discord in the system. When the discord oscillation has regularity, the QSLT tends to a certain value, and the quantum discord of the double "gravitational cat state" system has a certain relationship with the QSLT. In other words, the quantum discord will affect the rate of quantum state evolution to some extent, and the increase of quantum discord between systems will be more conducive to the evolution of quantum states.

TI Error per single-qubit gate below 10-4 in a superconducting
   qubit
SO NPJ QUANTUM INFORMATION
AB Implementing arbitrary single-qubit gates with near perfect fidelity is among the most fundamental requirements in gate-based quantum information processing. In this work, we fabricate a transmon qubit with long coherence times and demonstrate single-qubit gates with the average gate error below 10(-4), i.e. (7.42 +/- 0.04) x 10(-5) by randomized benchmarking (RB). To understand the error sources, we experimentally obtain an error budget, consisting of the decoherence errors lower bounded by (4.62 +/- 0.04) x 10(-5) and the leakage rate per gate of (1.16 +/- 0.04) x 10(-5). Moreover, we reconstruct the process matrices for the single-qubit gates by the gate set tomography (GST), with which we simulate RB sequences and obtain single-qubit fidelities consistent with experimental results. We also observe non-Markovian behavior in the experiment of long-sequence GST, which may provide guidance for further calibration. The demonstration extends the upper limit that the average fidelity of single-qubit gates can reach in a transmon-qubit system, and thus can be an essential step towards practical and reliable quantum computation in the near future.

AB Advances in quantum computing make Shor's algorithm for factorising numbers ever more tractable. This threatens the security of any cryptographic system which often relies on the difficulty of factorisation. It also threatens methods based on discrete logarithms, such as with the Diffie-Hellman key exchange method. For a cryptographic system to remain secure against a quantum adversary, we need to build methods based on a hard mathematical problem, which are not susceptible to Shor's algorithm and create Post Quantum Cryptography (PQC). While high-powered computing devices may be able to run these new methods, we need to investigate how well these methods run on limited powered devices. This paper outlines an evaluation framework for PQC within constrained devices, and contributes to the area by providing benchmarks of the front-running algorithms on a popular single-board low-power device. It also introduces a set of five notions which can be considered to determine the robustness of particular algorithms.

TI On the Definition of Quantum Programming Modules
SO APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL
AB There are no doubts that quantum programming and, in general, quantum computing, is one of the most promising areas within computer science and one of the areas where most expectations are being placed in recent years. Although the days when reliable and affordable quantum computers will be available is still a long way off, the explosion of programming languages for quantum programming has grown exponentially in recent years. The software engineering community has been quick to react to the need to adopt and adapt well-known tools and methods for software development, and for the design of new ones tailored to this new programming paradigm. However, many key aspects for its success depend on the establishment of an appropriate conceptual framework for the conception and design of quantum programs. This article discusses the concept of module, key in the software engineering discipline, and establishes initial criteria for determining the cohesion and coupling levels of a module in the field of quantum programming as a first step towards a sound quantum software engineering. As detailed in the article, the conceptual differences between classical and quantum computing are so pronounced that the translation of classical concepts to the new programming approach is not straightforward.

TI Uncertainty of quantum channels via modified generalized variance and
   modified generalized Wigner-Yanase-Dyson skew information
SO QUANTUM INFORMATION PROCESSING
AB Uncertainty relation is a fundamental issue in quantum mechanics and quantum information theory. By using modified generalized variance (MGV), and modified generalized Wigner-Yanase-Dyson skew information (MGWYD), we identify the total and quantum uncertainty of quantum channels. The elegant properties of the total uncertainty of quantum channels are explored in detail. In addition, we present a trade-off relation between the total uncertainty of quantum channels and the entanglement fidelity and establish the relationships between the total uncertainty and entropy exchange/coherent information. Detailed examples are given to the explicit formulas of the total uncertainty and the quantum uncertainty of quantum channels. Moreover, utilizing a realizable experimental measurement scheme by using the Mach-Zehnder interferometer proposed in Nirala et al. (Phys Rev A 99:022111, 2019), we discuss how to measure the total/quantum uncertainty of quantum channels for pure states.

TI Dynamical quantum maps for single-qubit gates under universal
   non-Markovian noise
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Noise is both ubiquitous and generally deleterious in settings where precision is required. This is especially true in the quantum technology sector where system utility typically decays rapidly under its influence. Understanding the noise in quantum devices is thus a prerequisite for efficient strategies to mitigate or even eliminate its harmful effects. However, this requires resources that are often prohibitive, such that the typically used noise models rely on simplifications that sometimes depart from experimental reality. Here we derive a compact microscopic error model for single-qubit gates that only requires a single experimental input-the noise power spectral density. Our model goes beyond standard depolarizing or Pauli-twirled noise models, explicitly including non-Clifford and non-Markovian contributions to the dynamical error map. We gauge our predictions for experimentally relevant metrics against established characterization techniques run on a trapped- ion quantum computer. In particular, we find that experimental estimates of average gate errors measured through randomized benchmarking and reconstructed via quantum process tomography are tightly lower-bounded by our analytical estimates, while the depolarizing model overestimates the gate error. Our noise modeling including non-Markovian contributions can be readily applied to established frameworks such as dynamical decoupling and dynamically corrected gates, or to provide more realistic thresholds for quantum error correction.

TI Qubit readout and quantum sensing with pulses of quantum radiation
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Different hypotheses about a quantum system such as the logical state of a qubit or the value of physical interaction parameters can be investigated by the interaction with a probe field. Such fields may be prepared in particularly sensitive quantum states and we demonstrate here the use of quantum trajectories to model the stochastic measurement record and conditional evolution of the state of the quantum system subject to its interaction with a traveling pulse of radiation. Our analysis applies to different measurement strategies and to arbitrary input quantum states of the probe field pulse and it thus permits direct comparison of their metrological advantages. A theoretical lower limit to the mean discrimination error can be calculated in a deterministic manner and we verify that it lies below the average inference error in all our examples.

TI Generating nonlinearities from conditional linear operations, squeezing,
   and measurement for quantum computation and super-Heisenberg sensing
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Large bosonic or continuous variable nonlinearities can have numerous applications, ranging from the generation of cat states for quantum computation, through to quantum sensing where the sensitivity exceeds Heisenberg scaling in the resources. However, the generation of ultra-large nonlinearities has proved immensely challenging experimentally. We describe a novel protocol where one can effectively generate large Kerr-type nonlinearities via the conditional application of a linear operation on an optical mode by an ancilla mode, followed by a measurement of the ancilla and corrective operation on the probe mode. Our protocol can generate high-quality Schrodinger cat states useful for quantum computing and can be used to perform sensing of an unknown rotation or displacement in phase space, with super-Heisenberg scaling in the resources. We finally describe a potential experimental implementation using atomic ensembles interacting with optical modes via the Faraday effect.

TI Quantum algorithm for smoothed particle hydrodynamics
SO COMPUTER PHYSICS COMMUNICATIONS
AB We present a quantum computing algorithm for the smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) method. We use a normalization procedure to encode the SPH operators and domain discretization in a quantum register. We then perform the SPH summation via an inner product of quantum registers. Using a onedimensional function, we test the approach in a classical sense for the kernel sum and first and second derivatives of a one-dimensional function, using both the Gaussian and Wendland kernel functions, and compare various register sizes against analytical results. Error convergence is exponentially fast in the number of qubits. We extend the method to solve the one-dimensional advection and diffusion partial differential equations, which are commonly encountered in fluids simulations. This work provides a foundation for a more general SPH algorithm, eventually leading to highly efficient simulations of complex engineering problems on gate-based quantum computers. & COPY; 2023 The Author(s).

TI Fabrication of low-loss symmetrical rib waveguides based on x-cut
   lithium niobate on insulator for integrated quantum photonics
SO ETRI JOURNAL
AB Lithium niobate on insulator (LNOI) is a promising material platform for applications in integrated quantum photonics. A low optical loss is crucial for preserving fragile quantum states. Therefore, in this study, we have fabricated LNOI rib waveguides with a low optical propagation loss of 0.16 dB/cm by optimizing the etching conditions for various parameters. The symmetry and smoothness of the waveguides on x-cut LNOI are improved by employing a shallow etching process. The proposed method is expected to facilitate the development of on-chip quantum photonic devices based on LNOI.

TI Quantum error correction with fractal topological codes
SO QUANTUM
AB Recently, a class of fractal surface codes (FSCs), has been constructed on fractal lattices with Hausdorff dimension 2+6, which admits a fault-tolerant non-Clifford CCZ gate [1]. We investigate the performance of such FSCs as fault-tolerant quantum memories. We prove that there exist decoding strategies with non-zero thresholds for bit-flip and phase-flip errors in the FSCs with Hausdorff dimension 2 + 6. For the bit-flip errors, we adapt the sweep decoder, developed for string-like syndromes in the regular 3D surface code, to the FSCs by designing suitable modifications on the boundaries of the holes in the fractal lattice. Our adaptation of the sweep decoder for the FSCs maintains its self-correcting and single-shot nature. For the phase-flip errors, we employ the minimum-weight-perfect-matching (MWPM) decoder for the point-like syndromes. We report a sustainable fault-tolerant threshold (similar to 1.7%) under phenomenological noise for the sweep decoder and the code capacity threshold (lower bounded by 2.95%) for the MWPM decoder for a particular FSC with Hausdorff dimension DH approximate to 2.966. The latter can be mapped to a lower bound of the critical point of a confinementHiggs transition on the fractal lattice, which is tunable via the Hausdorff dimension.

Employing a novel theoretical formalism to compute the full time-dependent many-body wave-function and utilizing a braiding protocol motivated by recent advances in electron-spin-resonance techniques we simulate quantum gates in 2D systems up to 600 sites, on timescales from a few femto- to nanoseconds. We demonstrate that the braiding process can be visualized in time and space by computing the non-equilibrium local density of states, which is proportional to the time-dependent differential conductance measured in scanning tunneling spectroscopy experiments, allowing us to directly image Majorana world lines.

TI Optimal quantum annealing: A variational shortcut-to-adiabaticity
   approach
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Suppressing unwanted transitions out of the instantaneous ground state is a major challenge in unitary adiabatic quantum computation. A recent approach consists in building counterdiabatic potentials approximated using variational strategies. In this contribution, we extend this variational approach to Lindbladian dynamics, having as a goal the suppression of diabatic transitions between pairs of Jordan blocks in quantum annealing. We show that, surprisingly, unitary counterdiabatic Ansatze are successful for dissipative dynamics as well, allowing for easier experimental implementations compared to Lindbladian Ansatze involving dissipation. Our approach not only guarantees improvements of open-system adiabaticity but also enhances the success probability of quantum annealing.

AB With the announcement of the most advanced silicon spin quantum-bit (qubit) chip by Intel, silicon-based quantum circuit manufacturing technology has shown the superior potential to realize quantum computing to other technologies because of the mature semiconductor manufacturing technologies and the compatibility with electronics. Due to the bottleneck in scalability caused by interconnections in silicon-based quantum circuits, crossbar architectures serve as one of the most promising solutions for circuitry implementation. This paper proposes the first satisfiability modulo theories (SMT) formulation to optimally solve the layout synthesis problem by simultaneously performing scheduling, mapping, and routing for silicon-based quantum systems with a specific crossbar architecture. The experiments demonstrate that the proposed method can effectively generate layout synthesis results with minimal usage of swap and shuttle gates within the shortest circuit depths, and the solutions greatly outperform those derived from a state-of-the-art work.

AB Adversarial noise attacks present a significant threat to quantum machine learning (QML) models, similar to their classical counterparts. This is especially true in the current Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum era, where noise is unavoidable. Therefore, it is essential to ensure the robustness of QML models before their deployment. To address this challenge, we introduce VeriQR, the first tool designed specifically for formally verifying and improving the robustness of QML models, to the best of our knowledge. This tool mimics real-world quantum hardware's noisy impacts by incorporating random noise to formally validate a QML model's robustness. VeriQR supports exact (sound and complete) algorithms for both local and global robustness verification. For enhanced efficiency, it implements an under-approximate (complete) algorithm and a tensor network-based algorithm to verify local and global robustness, respectively. As a formal verification tool, VeriQR can detect adversarial examples and utilize them for further analysis and to enhance the local robustness through adversarial training, as demonstrated by experiments on real-world quantum machine learning models. Moreover, it permits users to incorporate customized noise. Based on this feature, we assess VeriQR using various real-world examples, and experimental outcomes confirm that the addition of specific quantum noise can enhance the global robustness of QML models. These processes are made accessible through a user-friendly graphical interface provided by VeriQR, catering to general users without requiring a deep understanding of the counter-intuitive probabilistic nature of quantum computing.

Here we report a high-power 698-nm clock laser with a maximum output of 4W and minimized frequency noise up to a few kHz Fourier frequency, together with long-term instability of 3.5 x 10-17 at one to thousands of seconds. The laser-frequency noise is precisely characterized with atom-based spectral analysis that employs a pulse sequence designed to suppress sensitivity to intensity noise. This method provides universally applicable tunability of the spectral response and analysis of quantum sensors over a wide frequency range. With the optimized laser system characterized by this technique, we achieve an average single-qubit Clifford gate fidelity of up to F21 1/4 0.99964(3) when simultaneously driving 3000 optical qubits with a homogeneous Rabi frequency ranging from 10 Hz to 1 kHz. This result represents the highest single optical-qubit-gate fidelity for a large number of atoms.

TI Qutrit representation of quantum images: new quantum ternary circuit
   design
SO QUANTUM INFORMATION PROCESSING
AB Quantum computation is growing in significance and proving to be a powerful tool in meeting the high real-time computational demands of classical digital image processing. However, extensive research has been done on quantum image processing, mainly rooted in binary quantum systems. In this paper, we propose a new quantum ternary image circuit based on the analysis of the existing qutrit representation of quantum images. The proposed design utilizes ternary shift gates and ternary Muthukrishnan-Stroud gates, with the belief that this circuit can be used for ternary quantum image processing. This study makes a significant improvement compared to the existing counterpart in terms of quantum cost, the number of constant inputs, and garbage outputs, which are all essential parameters in quantum circuit design.

AB We introduce the first minimal and complete equational theory for quantum circuits. Hence, we show that any true equation on quantum circuits can be derived from simple rules, all of them being standard except a novel but intuitive one which states that a multi-control 2.. rotation is nothing but the identity. Our work improves on the recent complete equational theories for quantum circuits, by getting rid of several rules including a fairly impractical one. One of our main contributions is to prove the minimality of the equational theory, i.e. none of the rules can be derived from the other ones. More generally, we demonstrate that any complete equational theory on quantum circuits (when all gates are unitary) requires rules acting on an unbounded number of qubits. Finally, we also simplify the complete equational theories for quantum circuits with ancillary qubits and/or qubit discarding.

TI Tailoring Nonlinear Metamaterials for the Controlling of Spatial Quantum
   Entanglement
SO NANOMATERIALS
AB The high designability of metamaterials has made them an attractive platform for devising novel optoelectronic devices. The demonstration of nonlinear metamaterials further indicates their potential in developing quantum applications. Here, we investigate designing nonlinear metamaterials consisting of the 3-fold (C3) rotationally symmetrical nanoantennas for generating and modulating entangled photons in the spatial degrees of freedom. Through tailoring the geometry and orientation of the nanoantennas, the parametric down conversion process inside the metamaterials can be locally engineered to generate entangled states with desired spatial properties. As the orbital angular momentum (OAM) states are valuable for enhancing the data capacity of quantum information systems, the photonic OAM entanglement is practically considered. With suitable nanostructure design, the generation of OAM entangled states is shown to be effectively realized in the discussed nonlinear metamaterial system. The nonlinear metamaterials present a perspective to provide a flexible platform for quantum photonic applications.

TI Geometric entanglement of a photon and spin qubits in diamond
SO COMMUNICATIONS PHYSICS
AB Geometric nature, which appears in photon polarization, also appears in spin polarization under a zero magnetic field. These two polarized quanta, one travelling in vacuum and the other staying in matter, behave the same as geometric quantum bits or qubits, which are promising for noise resilience compared to the commonly used dynamic qubits. Here we show that geometric photon and spin qubits are entangled upon spontaneous emission with the help of the spin - orbit entanglement inherent in a nitrogen-vacancy center in diamond. The geometric spin qubit is defined in a degenerate subsystem of spin triplet electrons and manipulated with a polarized microwave. An experiment shows an entanglement state fidelity of 86.8%. The demonstrated entangled emission, combined with previously demonstrated entangled absorption, generates purely geometric entanglement between remote matters in a process that is insensitive of time, frequency, and space mode matching, which paves the way for building a noise-resilient quantum repeater network or a quantum internet.
   Preserving the entanglement of quantum bits is essential for the operation for all quantum technologies. Here, the geometric nature of spins in a diamond nitrogen vacancy is leveraged to improve the fidelity of entanglement with a spontaneously emitted photon.

TI Quantum pricing with a smile: implementation of local volatility model
   on quantum computer
SO EPJ QUANTUM TECHNOLOGY
AB Quantum algorithms for the pricing of financial derivatives have been discussed in recent papers. However, the pricing model discussed in those papers is too simple for practical purposes. It motivates us to consider how to implement more complex models used in financial institutions. In this paper, we consider the local volatility (LV) model, in which the volatility of the underlying asset price depends on the price and time. As in previous studies, we use the quantum amplitude estimation (QAE) as the main source of quantum speedup and discuss the state preparation step of the QAE, or equivalently, the implementation of the asset price evolution. We compare two types of state preparation: One is the amplitude encoding (AE) type, where the probability distribution of the derivative's payoff is encoded to the probabilistic amplitude. The other is the pseudo-random number (PRN) type, where sequences of PRNs are used to simulate the asset price evolution as in classical Monte Carlo simulation. We present detailed circuit diagrams for implementing these preparation methods in fault-tolerant quantum computation and roughly estimate required resources such as the number of qubits and T-count.

TI Engineering Quantum Nanophotonic Components from Hexagonal Boron Nitride
SO LASER & PHOTONICS REVIEWS
AB Integrated quantum photonics (IQP) provides a path to practical, scalable quantum computation, communications and information processing. Realization of an IQP platform requires controlled engineering of many nanophotonic components. However, the range of materials for monolithic platforms is limited by the simultaneous need for high-quality quantum light sources, high optical performance, and availability of scalable nanofabrication techniques. Here, the fabrication of IQP components from the recently emerged material hexagonal boron nitride (hBN), including tapered waveguides, microdisks, and 1D and 2D photonic crystal cavities, is demonstrated. Resonators with quality factors greater than 4000 are achieved, and proof-of-principle complex, free-standing IQP circuitry fabricated from single-crystal hBN is engineered. The results show the potential of hBN for scalable integrated quantum technologies.

TI Vulnerability of blockchain technologies to quantum attacks

AB Quantum computation represents a threat to many cryptographic protocols in operation today. It has been estimated that by 2035, there will exist a quantum computer capable of breaking the vital cryptographic scheme RSA2048. Blockchain technologies rely on cryptographic protocols for many of their essential sub-routines. Some of these protocols, but not all, are open to quantum attacks. Here we analyze the major blockchain-based cryptocurrencies deployed today-including Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin and ZCash, and determine their risk exposure to quantum attacks. We finish with a comparative analysis of the studied cryptocurrencies and their underlying blockchain technologies and their relative levels of vulnerability to quantum attacks.

TI Testing quantum entanglement via quantum state tomography with muons
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICS G-NUCLEAR AND PARTICLE PHYSICS
AB Entanglement is a fundamental pillar of quantum mechanics. Probing quantum entanglement and testing Bell inequality with muons can be a significant leap forward, as the muon is arguably one of the best elementary particles that can be manipulated and detected over a wide range of energies, e.g. from approximately 0.3-102 GeV, corresponding to velocities from 0.94 to nearly the speed of light. In this work, we present a realistic proposal and a comprehensive study of quantum entanglement in a state composed of different-flavor fermions in muon-electron scattering. The polarization density matrix for the muon-electron system is derived using a kinematic approach within the relativistic quantum field theory framework. Entanglement in the resulting muon-electron qubit system and the violation of the Bell inequality can be observed with a high event rate. This paves the way for performing quantum tomography with muons.

TI Continuous-Variable Assisted Thermal Quantum Simulation
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB Simulation of a quantum many-body system at finite temperatures is crucially important but quite challenging. Here we present an experimentally feasible quantum algorithm assisted with continuous variable for simulating quantum systems at finite temperatures. Our algorithm has a time complexity scaling polynomially with the inverse temperature and the desired accuracy. We demonstrate the quantum algorithm by simulating a finite temperature phase diagram of the quantum Ising and Kitaev models. It is found that the important crossover phase diagram of the Kitaev ring can be accurately simulated by a quantum computer with only a few qubits and thus the algorithm may be implementable on current quantum processors. We further propose a protocol with superconducting or trapped ion quantum computers.

TI Cost-optimal single-qubit gate synthesis in the Clifford hierarchy
SO QUANTUM
AB For universal quantum computation, a major challenge to overcome for practical implementation is the large amount of resources required for fault-tolerant quantum information processing. An important aspect is implementing arbitrary unitary operators built from logical gates within the quantum error correction code. A synthesis algorithm can be used to approximate any unitary gate up to arbitrary precision by assembling sequences of logical gates chosen from a small set of universal gates that are fault-tolerantly performable while encoded in a quantum error-correction code. However, current procedures do not yet support individual assignment of base gate costs and many do not support extended sets of universal base gates. We analysed cost-optimal sequences using an exhaustive search based on Dijkstra's pathfinding algorithm for the canonical Clifford+T set of base gates and compared them to when additionally including Z-rotations from higher orders of the Clifford hierarchy. Two approaches of assigning base gate costs were used. First, costs were reduced to T-counts by recursively applying a Z-rotation catalyst circuit. Second, costs were assigned as the average numbers of raw (i.e. physical level) magic states required to directly distil and implement the gates fault-tolerantly. We found that the average sequence cost decreases by up to 54 +/- 3% when using the Z-rotation catalyst circuit approach and by up to 33 +/- 2% when using the magic state distillation approach. In addition, we investigated observed limitations of certain assignments of base gate costs by developing an analytic model to estimate the proportion of sets of Z-rotation gates from higher orders of the Clifford hierarchy that are found within sequences approximating random target gates.

Here we present different forms of discrete-time quantum walks (DTQWs) and show their equivalence for physical realizations. Using an appropriate digital mapping of the position space on which a walker evolves to the multiqubit states of a quantum processor, we present different configurations of quantum circuits for the implementation of DTQWs in one-dimensional position space. We provide example circuits for a five-qubit processor and address scalability to higher dimensions as well as larger quantum processors.

TI Physics of the Majorana superconducting qubit hybrids
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
AB Manipulation of decoupled Majorana zero modes (MZMs) could enable topologically protected quantum computing. However, the practical realization of the large number of perfectly decoupled MZMs needed to perform nontrivial quantum computation has proven to be challenging so far. Fortunately, even a small number of imperfect MZMs can be used to qualitatively extend the behavior of standard superconducting qubits, allowing for new approaches for noise suppression, qubit manipulation, and readout. Such hybrid devices take advantage of the interplay of Cooper pair tunneling, coherent single-electron tunneling, and Majorana hybridization. Here we provide a qualitative understanding of this system, give analytical results for its ground state energy spanning the full parameter range, and describe potential sensing applications enabled by the interplay between Majorana and Cooper pair tunneling.

By utilizing SU(2) transformation, a speedup goal on gate operation is achieved with more freedom to design the control parameters. As an application, this protocol enables the conventional and unconventional nonadiabatic geometric quantum gates with desired evolution paths by controlling the microwave pulses in the diamond nitrogen-vacancy center system. We show that the inversely designed Hamiltonian can fulfill the geometric gate with more economical evolution time and further reduces the influence of the environment noise on gate fidelity.

TI Quantum Information Driven Ansatz (QIDA): Shallow-Depth Empirical
   Quantum Circuits from Quantum Chemistry
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY A
AB Hardware-efficient empirical variational ansatze for Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) simulations of quantum chemistry often lack a direct connection to classical quantum chemistry methods. In this work, we propose a method to bridge this gap by introducing a novel approach to constructing a starting point for variational quantum circuits, leveraging quantum mutual information from classical quantum chemistry states to design simple yet effective heuristic ansatze with a topology reflecting the molecular system's correlations. As a first step, we make use of quantum chemistry calculations, such as Moller-Plesset (MP2) perturbation theory, to initially provide approximate Natural Orbitals, which have been shown to be the best candidate one-electron basis for developing compact empirical wave functions.1 Second, we evaluate the quantum mutual information matrix, which provides insights about the main correlations between qubits of the quantum circuit, and enables a direct design of entangling blocks for the circuit. The resulting ansatz is then used with a VQE to obtain a short-depth variational ground state of the electronic Hamiltonian. To validate our approach, we perform a comprehensive statistical analysis through simulations of various molecular systems (H 2, LiH, H 2 O) and apply it to the more complex NH 3 molecule. The reported results demonstrate that the proposed methodology gives rise to highly effective ansatze, outperforming the standard empirical ladder-entangler ansatz. Overall, our approach can be used as an effective state preparation, providing a promising route for designing efficient variational quantum circuits for large molecular systems.

TI Protecting Quantum Information via Destructive Interference of
   Correlated Noise
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB Decoherence and imperfect control are crucial challenges for quantum technologies. Common protection strategies rely on noise temporal autocorrelation, which is not optimal if other correlations are present. We develop and demonstrate experimentally a strategy that uses the cross-correlation of two noise sources. Utilizing destructive interference of cross-correlated noise extends the coherence time tenfold, improves control fidelity, and surpasses the state-of-the-art sensitivity for high frequency quantum sensing, significantly expanding the applicability of noise protection strategies.

TI Scheme for implementing nonlocal high-fidelity quantum controlled-not
   gates on quantum-dot-confined electron spins using optical microcavities
   and photonic hyperentanglement
SO FRONTIERS IN PHYSICS
AB Quantum information networks can transmit quantum states and perform quantum operations between different quantum network nodes, which are essential for various applications of quantum information technology in the future. In this paper, a potentially practical scheme for implementing nonlocal quantum controlled-not (CNOT) gate operations on quantum-dot-confined electron spins between two quantum network nodes is presented. The scheme can realize parallel teleportation of two nonlocal quantum CNOT gates simultaneously by employing hyperentangled photon pairs to establish quantum channel, which can effectively improve the channel capacity and operational speed. The core of the scheme are two kinds of photon-spin hybrid quantum CNOT gate working in a failure-heralded and fidelity-robust fashion. With the heralded mechanism, the nonlocal CNOT gates can be implementated with unity fidelities in principle, even if the particularly ideal conditions commonly used in other schemes are not satisfied strictly. Our analysis and calculations indicate that the scheme can be demonstrated efficiently (with efficiency exceeding 99%) with current or near-future technologies. Moreover, the utilized photon-spin hybrid quantum gates can be regarded as universal modules for many other quantum information processing (QIP) tasks. Therefore, the scheme is potential for constructing elementary quantum networks, and realizing nolocal QIP with high channel capacities, high fidelities, and high efficiencies.

TI Simulating many-body open quantum systems by harnessing the power of
   artificial intelligence and quantum computing
SO JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL PHYSICS
AB Simulating many-body open quantum systems (OQSs) is challenging due to the intricate interplay between the system and its environment, resulting in strong quantum correlations in both space and time. This Perspective presents an overview of recently developed theoretical methods using artificial intelligence (AI) and quantum computing (QC) to simulate the dynamics of these systems. We briefly introduce the dissipaton-embedded quantum master equation in second quantization, which provides a single master equation suitable for representation by neural quantum states or quantum circuits. The promising performance of AI- and QC-based approaches is demonstrated through preliminary research on simulating the quantum dissipative dynamics of many-body OQSs. We also discuss the limitations and future developments of these methods, which hold promise for overcoming the computational challenges associated with many-body OQS dynamics.

TI Quantum computing and materials science: A practical guide to applying
   quantum annealing to the configurational analysis of materials
SO JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYSICS
AB Using quantum computers for computational chemistry and materials science will enable us to tackle problems that are intractable on classical computers. In this paper, we show how the relative energy of defective graphene structures can be calculated by using a quantum annealer. This simple system is used to guide the reader through the steps needed to translate a chemical structure (a set of atoms) and energy model to a representation that can be implemented on quantum annealers (a set of qubits). We discuss in detail how different energy contributions can be included in the model and what their effect is on the final result. The code used to run the simulation on D-Wave quantum annealers is made available as a Jupyter Notebook. This Tutorial was designed to be a quick-start guide for the computational chemists interested in running their first quantum annealing simulations. The methodology outlined in this paper represents the foundation for simulating more complex systems, such as solid solutions and disordered systems.

TI Multi-party Quantum Key Agreement Protocol with Authentication
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF THEORETICAL PHYSICS
AB Utilizing the advantage of quantum entanglement swapping, a multi-party quantum key agreement protocol with authentication is proposed. In this protocol, a semi-trusted third party is introduced, who prepares Bell states, and sends one particle to multiple participants respectively. After that the participants can share a Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger state by entanglement swapping. Finally, these participants measure the particles in their hands and obtain an agreement key. Here, classical hash function and Hadamard operation are utilized to authenticate the identity of participants. The correlations of GHZ states ensure the security of the proposed protocol. To illustrated it detailly, the security of this protocol against common attacks is analyzed, which shows that the proposed protocol is secure in theory.

TI Entangling remote qubits using the single-photon protocol: an in-depth
   theoretical and experimental study
SO NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB The generation of entanglement between remote matter qubits has developed into a key capability for fundamental investigations as well as for emerging quantum technologies. In the single-photon, protocol entanglement is heralded by generation of qubit-photon entangled states and subsequent detection of a single photon behind a beam splitter. In this work we perform a detailed theoretical and experimental investigation of this protocol and its various sources of infidelity. We develop an extensive theoretical model and subsequently tailor it to our experimental setting, based on nitrogen-vacancy centers in diamond. Experimentally, we verify the model by generating remote states for varying phase and amplitudes of the initial qubit superposition states and varying optical phase difference of the photons arriving at the beam splitter. We show that a static frequency offset between the optical transitions of the qubits leads to an entangled state phase that depends on the photon detection time. We find that the implementation of a Charge-Resonance check on the nitrogen-vacancy center yields transform-limited linewidths. Moreover, we measure the probability of double optical excitation, a significant source of infidelity, as a function of the power of the excitation pulse. Finally, we find that imperfect optical excitation can lead to a detection-arm-dependent entangled state fidelity and rate. The conclusion presented here are not specific to the nitrogen-vacancy centers used to carry out the experiments, and are therefore readily applicable to other qubit platforms.

TI A versatile single-photon-based quantum computing platform
SO NATURE PHOTONICS
AB Quantum computing aims at exploiting quantum phenomena to efficiently perform computations that are unfeasible even for the most powerful classical supercomputers. Among the promising technological approaches, photonic quantum computing offers the advantages of low decoherence, information processing with modest cryogenic requirements, and native integration with classical and quantum networks. So far, quantum computing demonstrations with light have implemented specific tasks with specialized hardware, notably Gaussian boson sampling, which permits the quantum computational advantage to be realized. Here we report a cloud-accessible versatile quantum computing prototype based on single photons. The device comprises a high-efficiency quantum-dot single-photon source feeding a universal linear optical network on a reconfigurable chip for which hardware errors are compensated by a machine-learned transpilation process. Our full software stack allows remote control of the device to perform computations via logic gates or direct photonic operations. For gate-based computation, we benchmark one-, two- and three-qubit gates with state-of-the art fidelities of 99.6 +/- 0.1%, 93.8 +/- 0.6% and 86 +/- 1.2%, respectively. We also implement a variational quantum eigensolver, which we use to calculate the energy levels of the hydrogen molecule with chemical accuracy. For photon native computation, we implement a classifier algorithm using a three-photon-based quantum neural network and report a six-photon boson sampling demonstration on a universal reconfigurable integrated circuit. Finally, we report on a heralded three-photon entanglement generation, a key milestone toward measurement-based quantum computing.
   A versatile cloud-accessible single-photon-based quantum computing machine is developed, which shows a six-photon sampling rate of 4 Hz over weeks. Heralded generation of a three-photon Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger state-a key milestone toward measurement-based quantum computing-is implemented.

TI Unveiling Sudden Transitions Between Classical and Quantum Decoherence
   in the Hyperfine Structure of Hydrogen Atoms
SO ENTROPY
AB This paper investigates the dynamics of quantum and classical geometric correlations in the hyperfine structure of the hydrogen atom under pure dephasing noise, focusing on the interplay between entangled initial states and environmental effects. We employ the Lindblad master equation to model dephasing, deriving differential equations for the density matrix elements to capture the evolution of the system. The study explores various entangled initial states, characterized by parameters a1, a2, and a3, and their impact on correlation dynamics under different dephasing rates Gamma. A trace distance approach is utilized to quantify classical and quantum geometric correlations, offering comparative insights into their behavior. Numerical analysis reveals a transition point where classical and quantum correlations equalize, followed by distinct decay and stabilization phases, influenced by initial coherence along the z-axis. Our results reveal a universal sudden transition from classical to quantum decoherence, consistent with observations in other open quantum systems. They highlight how initial state preparation and dephasing strength critically influence the stability of quantum and classical correlations, with direct implications for quantum metrology and the development of noise-resilient quantum technologies. By focusing on the hyperfine structure of hydrogen, this study addresses a timely and relevant problem, bridging fundamental quantum theory with experimentally accessible atomic systems and emerging quantum applications.

SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY LETTERS
AB We pinpoint the key ingredients ruling decoherence in multispin clusters, and we engineer the system Hamiltonian to design optimal molecules embedding quantum error correction. These are antiferromagnetically coupled systems with competing exchange interactions, characterized by many low-energy states in which decoherence is dramatically suppressed and does not increase with the system size. This feature allows us to derive optimized code words, enhancing the power of the quantum error correction code by orders of magnitude. We demonstrate this by a complete simulation of the system dynamics, including the effect of decoherence driven by a nuclear spin bath and the full sequence of pulses to implement error correction and logical gates between protected states.

TI Scheme of preparing cluster states with cat qubits
SO NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB Cluster states are essential quantum resources for one-way quantum computations and quantum networks. The reliable generation of cluster states in specific quantum systems is crucial for initializing complex quantum operations. In this paper, we introduce an efficient scheme for the deterministic preparation of a cluster state via circuit quantum electrodynamics (QED). Our scheme involves four individual microwave resonators, each of which is coupled to a superconducting transmon qutrit. We demonstrated that a four-cqubit cluster state can be achieved using three controlled-phase gate operations. The cluster state is prepared deterministically, eliminating the need for measurement-based feedback. Throughout these operations, the qutrit remains in its ground state, effectively minimizing decoherence from the qutrit. Numerical simulations suggest that our scheme can generate high-fidelity cluster states using current-circuit QED technology. We believe that our model will facilitate exploration of future large-scale continuous-variable quantum information processing systems.

TI Improving the Efficiency of Quantum Circuits for Information Set
   Decoding
SO ACM TRANSACTIONS ON QUANTUM COMPUTING
AB Code-based cryptosystems are a promising option for Post-Quantum Cryptography, as neither classical nor quantum algorithms provide polynomial time solvers for their underlying hard problem. Indeed, to provide sound alternatives to lattice-based cryptosystems, U.S. National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) advanced all round 3 code-based cryptosystems to round 4 of its Post-Quantum standardization initiative. We present a complete implementation of a quantum circuit based on the Information Set Decoding (ISD) strategy, the best known one against code-based cryptosystems, providing quantitative measures for the security margin achieved with respect to the quantum-accelerated key recovery on AES, targeting both the current state-of-the-art approach and the NIST estimates. Our work improves the state-of-the-art, reducing the circuit depth by 219 to 230 for all the parameters of the NIST selected cryptosystems, mainly due to an improved quantum Gauss-Jordan elimination circuit with respect to previous proposals. We show how our Prange's-based quantum ISD circuit reduces the security margin with respect to its classical counterpart. Finally, we address the concern brought forward in the latest NIST report on the parameters choice for the McEliece cryptosystem, showing that its parameter choice yields a computational effort slightly below the required target level.

AB Quantum computers are becoming a reality and numerous quantum computing applications with a near-term perspective (e.g., for finance, chemistry, machine learning, and optimization) and with a long-term perspective (e.g., for cryptography or unstructured search) are currently being investigated. However, designing and realizing potential applications for these devices in a scalable fashion requires automated, efficient, and user-friendly software tools that cater to the needs of end users, engineers, and physicists at every level of the entire quantum software stack. Many of the problems to be tackled in that regard are similar to design problems from the classical realm for which sophisticated design automation tools have been developed in the previous decades.
   The Munich Quantum Toolkit (MQT) is a collection of software tools for quantum computing developed by the Chair for Design Automation at the Technical University of Munich which explicitly utilizes this design automation expertise. Our overarching objective is to provide solutions for design tasks across the entire quantum software stack. This entails high-level support for end users in realizing their applications, efficient methods for the classical simulation, compilation, and verification of quantum circuits, tools for quantum error correction, support for physical design, and more. These methods are supported by corresponding data structures (such as decision diagrams or the ZX-calculus) and core methods (such as SAT encodings/solvers). All of the developed tools are available as open-source implementations and are hosted on github.com/cda-tum.

TI On the Representation of Boolean and Real Functions as Hamiltonians for
   Quantum Computing
SO ACM TRANSACTIONS ON QUANTUM COMPUTING
AB Mapping functions on bits to Hamiltonians acting on qubits has many applications in quantum computing. In particular, Hamiltonians representing Boolean functions are required for applications of quantum annealing or the quantum approximate optimization algorithm to combinatorial optimization problems. We show how such functions are naturally represented by Hamiltonians given as sums of Pauli Z operators (Ising spin operators) with the terms of the sum corresponding to the function's Fourier expansion. For many classes of Boolean functionswhich are given by a compact description, such as a Boolean formula in conjunctive normal form that gives an instance of the satisfiability problem, it is #P-hard to compute its Hamiltonian representation, i.e., as hard as computing its number of satisfying assignments. On the other hand, no such difficulty exists generally for constructing Hamiltonians representing a real function such as a sum of local Boolean clauses each acting on a fixed number of bits as is common in constraint satisfaction problems. We show composition rules for explicitly constructing Hamiltonians representing a wide variety of Boolean and real functions by combining Hamiltonians representing simpler clauses as building blocks, which are particularly suitable for direct implementation as classical software. We further apply our results to the construction of controlled-unitary operators, and to the special case of operators that compute function values in an ancilla qubit register. Finally, we outline several additional applications and extensions of our results to quantum algorithms for optimization. A goal of this work is to provide a design toolkit for quantum optimization which may be utilized by experts and practitioners alike in the construction and analysis of new quantum algorithms, and at the same time to provide a unified framework for the various constructions appearing in the literature.

AB Quantum network simulators offer the opportunity to cost-efficiently investigate potential avenues for building networks that scale with the number of users, communication distance, and application demands by simulating alternative hardware designs and control protocols. Several quantum network simulators have been recently developed with these goals in mind. As the size of the simulated networks increases, however, sequential execution becomes time-consuming. Parallel execution presents a suitable method for scalable simulations of large-scale quantum networks, but the unique attributes of quantum information create unexpected challenges. In this work, we identify requirements for parallel simulation of quantum networks and develop the first parallel discrete-event quantum network simulator by modifying the existing serial simulator SeQUeNCe. Our contributions include the design and development of a quantum state manager (QSM) that maintains shared quantum information distributed across multiple processes. We also optimize our parallel code by minimizing the overhead of the QSM and decreasing the amount of synchronization needed among processes. Using these techniques, we observe a speedup of 2 to 25 times when simulating a 1,024-node linear network topology using 2 to 128 processes. We also observe an efficiency greater than 0.5 for up to 32 processes in a linear network topology of the same size and with the same workload. We repeat this evaluation with a randomized workload on a caveman network. We also introduce several methods for partitioning networks by mapping them to different parallel simulation processes. We have released the parallel SeQUeNCe simulator as an open source tool alongside the existing sequential version.

TI Layer codes
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Quantum computers require memories that are capable of storing quantum information reliably for long periods of time. The surface code is a two-dimensional quantum memory with code parameters that scale optimally with the number of physical qubits, under the constraint of two-dimensional locality. In three spatial dimensions an analogous simple yet optimal code was not previously known. Here we present a family of three dimensional topological codes with optimal scaling code parameters and a polynomial energy barrier. Our codes are based on a construction that takes in a stabilizer code and outputs a three-dimensional topological code with related code parameters. The output codes are topological defect networks formed by layers of surface code joined along one-dimensional junctions, with a maximum stabilizer check weight of six. When the input is a family of good quantum low-density parity-check codes the output codes have optimal scaling. Our results uncover strongly-correlated states of quantum matter that are capable of storing quantum information with the strongest possible protection from errors that is achievable in three dimensions.
   Quantum error correcting codes are inefficient when implemented on platforms with local connectivity in two dimensions, which motivates platforms with 3D connectivity and codes applicable in these conditions. Here, the authors show how to transform any CSS stabilizer code into a 3D topological code, leading to codes with optimal asymptotic scaling in 3D.

TI Homogeneous Free-Standing Nanostructures from Bulk Diamond over
   Millimeter Scales for Quantum Technologies
SO NANO LETTERS
AB Quantum devices based on optically addressable spin qubits in diamond are promising platforms for quantum technologies such as quantum sensing and communication. Nano- and microstructuring of the diamond crystal is essential to enhance device performance, yet fabrication remains challenging and often involves trade-offs in surface quality, aspect ratio, device size, and uniformity. We tackle this hurdle with an approach producing millimeter-scale, thin (down to 70 nm), and highly parallel (< 0.35 nm/mu m) membranes from single-crystal diamond. The membranes remain contamination free and possess atomically smooth surfaces (R-q < 200 pm) as required by state-of-the-art quantum applications. We demonstrate the benefits and versatility of our method by fabricating large fields of free-standing and homogeneous photonic nano- and microstructures. Leveraging a refined photolithography-based strategy, our method offers enhanced scalability and produces robust structures suitable for direct use, while remaining compatible with heterogeneous integration through pick-and-place transfer techniques.

TI Full quantum tomography study of Google's Sycamore gate on IBM's quantum
   computers
SO EPJ QUANTUM TECHNOLOGY
AB The potential of achieving computational hardware with quantum advantage depends heavily on the quality of quantum gate operations. However, the presence of imperfect two-qubit gates poses a significant challenge and acts as a major obstacle in developing scalable quantum information processors. Google's Quantum AI and collaborators claimed to have conducted a supremacy regime experiment. In this experiment, a new two-qubit universal gate called the Sycamore gate is constructed and employed to generate random quantum circuits (RQCs), using a programmable quantum processor with 53 qubits. These computations were carried out in a computational state space of size 9 x 10 15 \documentclass[12pt]{minimal} \usepackage{amsmath} \usepackage{wasysym} \usepackage{amsfonts} \usepackage{amssymb} \usepackage{amsbsy} \usepackage{mathrsfs} \usepackage{upgreek} \setlength{\oddsidemargin}{-69pt} \begin{document}$9 \times 10<^>{15}$\end{document} . Nevertheless, even in strictly-controlled laboratory settings, quantum information on quantum processors is susceptible to various disturbances, including undesired interaction with the surroundings and imperfections in the quantum state. To address this issue, we conduct both quantum state tomography (QST) and quantum process tomography (QPT) experiments on Google's Sycamore gate using different artificial architectural superconducting quantum computer. Furthermore, to demonstrate how errors affect gate fidelity at the level of quantum circuits, we design and conduct full QST experiments for the five-qubit eight-cycle circuit, which was introduced as an example of the programability of Google's Sycamore quantum processor. These quantum tomography experiments are conducted in three distinct environments: noise-free, noisy simulation, and on IBM Quantum's genuine quantum computer. Our results offer valuable insights into the performance of IBM Quantum's hardware and the robustness of Sycamore gates within this experimental setup. These findings contribute to our understanding of quantum hardware performance and provide valuable information for optimizing quantum algorithms for practical applications.

TI Experimental quantum Byzantine agreement on a three-user quantum network
   with integrated photonics
SO SCIENCE ADVANCES
AB Quantum communication networks are crucial for both secure communication and cryptographic networked tasks. Building quantum communication networks in a scalable and cost-effective way is essential for their widespread adoption. Here, we establish a complete polarization entanglement-based fully connected network, which features an ultrabright integrated Bragg reflection waveguide quantum source, managed by an untrusted service provider, and a streamlined polarization analysis module, which requires only one single-photon detector for each user. We perform a continuously working quantum entanglement distribution and create correlated bit strings between users. Within the framework of one-time universal hashing, we provide the experimental implementation of source-independent quantum digital signatures using imperfect keys circumventing the necessity for private amplification. We further beat the 1/3 fault tolerance bound in the Byzantine agreement, achieving unconditional security without relying on sophisticated techniques. Our results offer an affordable and practical route for addressing consensus challenges within the emerging quantum network landscape.

TI Symmetry-adapted encodings for qubit number reduction by point-group and
   other Boolean symmetries
SO QUANTUM SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB A symmetry-adapted fermion-to-spin mapping or encoding that is able to store information about the occupancy of the n spin-orbitals of a molecular system into a lower number of n - k qubits in a quantum computer (where the number of reduced qubits k ranges from 2 to 5 depending on the symmetry of the system) is introduced. This mapping reduces the computational cost of a quantum computing simulation and at the same time enforces symmetry constraints. These symmetry-adapted encodings (SAEs) can be explicitly seen as a block-diagonalization of the Jordan-Wigner qubit Hamiltonian, followed by an orthogonal projection. We provide the form of the Clifford tableau for a general class of fermion-to-qubit encodings, and then use it to construct the map that block-diagonalizes the Hamiltonian in the SAEs. The algorithm proposed does not require any further computations to obtain this map, which is derived directly from the character table of the molecular point group. An implementation of the algorithm is presented as an open-source Python package, QuantumSymmetry, a user guide and code examples. QuantumSymmetry uses open-source quantum chemistry software PySCF for Hartree-Fock calculations, and is compatible with quantum computing toolsets OpenFermion and Qiskit. QuantumSymmetry takes arbitrary user input such as the molecular geometry and atomic basis set to construct the qubit operators that correspond in the appropriate SAE to fermionic operators on the molecular system, such as the second-quantized electronic structure Hamiltonian. QuantumSymmetry is used to produce numerical examples of variational quantum algorithm simulations to find the ground state energy for a number of example molecules, for both Unitary Coupled Clusters with Singles and Doubles and Adaptive Derivative Assembled Pseudo-Trotter Variational Quantum Eigensolver ansatze. We show that, beyond the advantage given by the lower qubit count, the proposed encodings consistently result in shallower and less complex circuits with a reduced number of variational parameters that are able to reach convergence faster and without any loss of computed accuracy.

TI Twin-Field Quantum Network Coding for Multi-Party Key Distribution
SO QUANTUM INFORMATION & COMPUTATION
AB Quantum network coding enables multi-party quantum interactions over bottleneck channels. The communication distance is usually constrained by the instability of quantum states. Twin-field quantum key distribution is designed to improve the communication distance, but it can only be applied in point-to-point scenarios. In this paper, we propose a feasible twin-field quantum network coding scheme, which enables multi-party key distribution over long distance in networks with bottleneck channels. Firstly, a butterfly network model is designed for long-distance communication. Then, the coding method at each intermediate node is designed to overcome the limitations of bottleneck channels. Finally, the key rate and decoy-state transmission features are derived to demonstrate the security and efficiency advantages. Compared with the original point-to-point twin-field quantum key distribution protocol, the proposed scheme can distribute a group key among the four end nodes of the butterfly network with only one transmission round. The key rate R and the channel transmittance eta still satisfy R proportional to eta 1/2. Such results will extend the communication distance and provide a foundation for the construction of large-scale quantum networks.

TI Local Quantum Uncertainty and Quantum Interferometric Power in an
   Anisotropic Two-Qubit System
SO UNIVERSE
AB Investigating the favorable configurations for non-classical correlations preservation has remained a hotly debated topic for the last decade. In this regard, we present a two-qubit Heisenberg spin chain system exposed to a time-dependent external magnetic field. The impact of various crucial parameters, such as initial strength and angular frequency of the external magnetic field along with the state's purity and anisotropy of the spin-spin on the dynamical behavior of quantum correlations are considered. We utilize local quantum uncertainty (LQU) and quantum interferometric power (QIP) to investigate the dynamics of quantum correlations. We show that under the critical angular frequency of the external magnetic field and the spin-spin anisotropy, quantum correlations in the system can be successfully preserved. LQU and QIP suffer a drop as the interaction between the system and field is initiated, however, are quickly regained by the system. This tendency is confirmed by computing a measure of non-classical correlations according to the Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt inequality. Notably, the initial and final preserved levels of quantum correlations are only varied when variation is caused in the state's purity.

TI Modeling quantum light interference on a quantum computer
SO APPLIED PHYSICS LETTERS
AB Modeling of photonic devices traditionally involves solving the equations of light-matter interaction and light propagation. Here, we demonstrate an alternative modeling methodology by reproducing the optical device functionality using a quantum computer. As an illustration, we simulate the quantum interference of light on a thin absorbing film. Such interference can lead to either perfect absorption or total transmission of light through the film, the phenomena attracting attention for data processing applications in classical and quantum information networks. We map the behavior of the photon in the interference experiment to the evolution of a quantum state of transmon, a superconducting charge qubit of the IBM quantum computer. Details of the real optical experiment are flawlessly reproduced on the quantum computer. We argue that the superiority of this methodology shall be apparent in modeling complex multi-photon optical phenomena and devices. (c) 2022 Author(s).

TI Spatial Mode Correction of Single Photons Using Machine Learning
SO ADVANCED QUANTUM TECHNOLOGIES
AB Spatial modes of light constitute valuable resources for a variety of quantum technologies ranging from quantum communication and quantum imaging to remote sensing. Nevertheless, their vulnerabilities to phase distortions, induced by random media, impose significant limitations on the realistic implementation of numerous quantum-photonic technologies. Unfortunately, this problem is exacerbated at the single-photon level. Over the last two decades, this challenging problem has been tackled through conventional schemes that utilize optical nonlinearities, quantum correlations, and adaptive optics. In this article, the self-learning and self-evolving features of artificial neural networks are exploited to correct the complex spatial profile of distorted Laguerre-Gaussian modes at the single-photon level. Furthermore, the potential of this technique is used to improve the channel capacity of an optical communication protocol that relies on structured single photons. The results have important implications for real-time turbulence correction of structured photons and single-photon images.

TI Dissipative Protection of a GKP Qubit in a High-Impedance
   Superconducting Circuit Driven by a Microwave Frequency Comb
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW X
AB We propose a novel approach to generate, protect, and control Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill (GKP) qubits. It employs a microwave frequency comb parametrically modulating a Josephson circuit to enforce a dissipative dynamics of a high-impedance circuit mode, autonomously stabilizing the finite-energy GKP code. The encoded GKP qubit is robustly protected against all dominant decoherence channels plaguing superconducting circuits but quasiparticle poisoning. In particular, noise from ancillary modes leveraged for dissipation engineering does not propagate at the logical level. In a state-of-the-art experimental setup, we estimate that the encoded qubit lifetime could extend 2 orders of magnitude beyond the break-even point, with substantial margin for improvement through progress in fabrication and control electronics. Qubit initialization, readout, and control via Clifford gates can be performed while maintaining the code stabilization, paving the way toward the assembly of GKP qubits in a fault-tolerant quantum computing architecture.

TI Global variational quantum circuits for arbitrary symmetric state
   preparation
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Quantum states that are symmetric under particle exchange play a crucial role in fields such as quantum metrology and quantum error correction. We use a variational circuit composed of global one-axis twisting and global rotations to efficiently prepare arbitrary symmetric states, i.e., any superposition of Dicke states. The circuit does not require local addressability or ancilla qubits and thus can be readily implemented in a variety of experimental platforms including trapped-ion quantum simulators and cavity QED systems. We provide analytic and numerical evidence that any N-qubit symmetric state can be prepared in 2N/3 steps. We demonstrate the utility of our protocol by preparing (i) metrologically useful N-qubit Dicke states of up to N = 300 qubits in O(1) gate steps with theoretical infidelities 1-F < 10(-3), (ii) the N = 9 Ruskai codewords in P = 4 gate steps with 1-F < 10(-4), and (iii) the N = 13 Gross codewords in P = 7 gate steps with 1-F < 10(-4). Focusing on trapped-ion platforms, for the N = 9 Ruskai and N = 13 Gross codewords we estimate that the protocol achieves fidelities greater than or similar to 95% in the presence of typical experimental noise levels, thus providing a pathway to the preparation of a wide range of useful highly entangled quantum states.

TI Hybrid satellite-fiber quantum network
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW APPLIED
AB Quantum networks hold promise for key distribution, private and distributed computing, and quantum sensing, among other applications. The scale of such networks for ground users is currently limited by one's ability to distribute entanglement between distant locations. This can in principle be carried out by transmitting entangled photons through optical fibers or satellites. The former is limited by fiber-optic attenuation, while the latter is limited by atmospheric extinction and diffraction. Here, we propose a hybrid network and protocol that outperform both ground- and satellite-based designs and lead to high-fidelity entanglement at a continental or even global scale.

TI High-Fidelity Universal Gates in the 171Yb Ground-State Nuclear-Spin
   Qubit
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB Arrays of optically trapped neutral atoms are a promising architecture for the realization of quantum computers. In order to run increasingly complex algorithms, it is advantageous to demonstrate high-fidelity and flexible gates between long-lived and highly coherent qubit states. In this work, we demonstrate a universal high-fidelity gate set with individually controlled and parallel application of single-qubit gates and two-qubit gates operating on the ground-state nuclear-spin qubit in arrays of tweezer-trapped171Yb atoms. We utilize the long lifetime, flexible control, and high gate fidelity of our system to characterize native gates using single-and two-qubit Clifford and symmetric subspace randomized-benchmarking circuits with more than 200 controlled-Z (CZ) gates applied to one or two pairs of atoms. We measure our twoqubit entangling gate fidelity to be 99.72(3)% (99.40(3)%) with (without) postselection. In addition, we introduce a simple and optimized method for calibration of multiparameter quantum gates. These results represent important milestones toward executing complex and general quantum computation with neutral atoms.

TI Holographic quantum information and (de)confinement
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MODERN PHYSICS A
AB Analyzing the phenomenon of deconfinement from a holographic point of view, it appears that the brane configuration in the bulk, corresponding to the confinement phase imposes a restriction on the strength of the holographic quantum error correction procedure. This restriction is partially removed when the transition to a deconfined phase occurs. The brane configurations corresponding to the bulk instantons are analyzed and it is shown that they cannot reach the region of the bulk that would ensure maximal error protection in the confinement phase, while keeping non-zero instanton size. In the deconfinement phase on the other side, we have a configuration that allows a higher degree of quantum error protection, still preventing the maximal protection allowed by the holographic principle. This suggests that the strength of quantum error correction codes in QCD systems is fundamentally limited both in confinement and deconfinement phases.

In this work, we formulate the theory of (time-dependent) variational quantum simulation of the 1 + 1 dimensional lambda phi(4) quantum field theory including encoding, state preparation, and time evolution, with several numerical simulation results. These algorithms could be understood as near-term variational quantum circuit (quantum neural network) analogs of the Jordan-Lee-Preskill algorithm, the basic algorithm for simulating quantum field theory using universal quantum devices. Besides, we highlight the advantages of encoding with harmonic oscillator basis based on the Lehmann-Symanzik-Zimmermann reduction formula and several computational efficiency such as when implementing a bosonic version of the unitary coupled cluster ansatz to prepare initial states. We also discuss how to circumvent the "spectral crowding' problem in the quantum field theory simulation and appraise our algorithm by both state and subspace fidelities.

TI Fault-Tolerant Quantum Computation with Static Linear Optics
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB The scalability of photonic implementations of fault-tolerant quantum computing based on Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill (GKP) qubits is injured by the requirements of inline squeezing and reconfigurability of the linear optical network. In this work we propose a topologically error-corrected architecture that does away with these elements at no cost-in fact, at an advantage-to state preparation overheads. Our computer consists of three modules: a two-dimensional (2D) array of probabilistic sources of GKP states; a depth-four circuit of static beam splitters, phase shifters, and short delay lines; and a 2D array of homodyne detectors. The symmetry of our proposed circuit allows us to combine the effects of finite squeezing and uniform photon loss within the noise model, resulting in more comprehensive threshold estimates. These jumps over both architectural and analytical hurdles considerably expedite the construction of a photonic quantum computer.

TI Privacy-Preserving Bidirectional Data Transmission of Smart Grid Via
   Semi-Quantum Computation: On Mutual Identity and Message Authentication
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON DEPENDABLE AND SECURE COMPUTING
AB This paper is concerned with the privacy-preserving bidirectional electric power data transmission problem of the smart grid. A privacy-preserving bidirectional data transmission (BDT) protocol is developed over semi-quantum computation with aim to achieve bidirectional sensitive data flow between power suppliers and users. The minimal quantum cost is pursued under practical constraints while ensuring that power sensitive information is not leaked. To achieve the goal, a two-way data transmission protocol is first proposed that combines mutual identity authentication with message authentication for the benefits of enhanced security. Furthermore, for the preservation of privacy, a semi-quantum duplex communication approach is utilized, wherein the quantum state is randomly divided into two parts: teleportation and measurement qubits. The effectiveness of the privacy-preserving scheme against existing attack strategies is also rigorously analyzed. Lastly, simulation studies conducted on the IBM quantum cloud platform validate and underscore the superiority of the developed privacy-preserving BDT protocol.

TI Low-Rank Variational Quantum Algorithm for the Dynamics of Open Quantum
   Systems
SO QUANTUM
AB The simulation of many-body open quantum systems is key to solving numerous outstanding problems in physics, chemistry, material science, and in the development of quantum technologies. Near- term quantum computers may bring considerable advantage for the efficient simulation of their static and dynamical properties, thanks to hybrid quantum-classical variational algorithms to approximate the dynamics of the density matrix describing the quantum state in terms of an ensemble average. Here, a variational quantum algorithm is developed to simulate the real-time evolution of the density matrix governed by the Lindblad master equation, under the assumption that the quantum state has a bounded entropy along the dynamics, entailing a low-rank representation of its density matrix. The algorithm encodes each pure state of the statistical mixture as a parametrized quantum circuit, and the associated probabilities as additional variational parameters stored classically, thereby requiring a significantly lower number of qubits than algorithms where the full density matrix is encoded in the quantum memory. Two variational ansatze are proposed, and their effectiveness is assessed in the simulation of the dynamics of a 2D dissipative transverse field Ising model. The results underscore the algorithm's efficiency in simulating the dynamics of open quantum systems in the low-rank regime with limited quantum resources on a near-term quantum device.

We show that it is possible to construct such a scheme directly from a quantum secure classical homomorphic encryption scheme with certain properties. Finally, we show that a classical homomorphic encryption scheme with the required properties can be constructed from the learning with errors problem.

TI Spin-squeezed Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill codes for quantum error
   correction in atomic ensembles
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill (GKP) codes encode a qubit in displaced phase-space combs of a continuous-variable (CV) quantum system and are useful for correcting a variety of high-weight photonic errors. Here we propose atomic ensemble analogs of the single-mode CV GKP code by using the quantum central limit theorem to pull back the phase-space structure of a CV system to the compact phase space of a quantum spin system. We study the optimal recovery performance of these codes under error channels described by stochastic relaxation and isotropic ballistic dephasing processes using the diversity combining approach for calculating channel fidelity. We find that the spin GKP codes outperform other spin system codes such as cat codes or binomial codes. Our spin GKP codes based on the two-axis countertwisting interaction and superpositions of SU(2) coherent states are direct spin analogs of the finite-energy CV GKP codes, whereas our codes based on one-axis twisting do not yet have well-studied CV analogs. A state preparation scheme for the spin GKP codes is proposed which uses the linear-combination-of-unitaries method, applicable to both the CV and spin GKP settings. Finally, we discuss a fault-tolerant approximate gate set for quantum computing with spin-GKP-encoded qubits, obtained by translating gates from the CV GKP setting using the quantum central limit theorem.

TI Non-Abelian Self-Correcting Quantum Memory and Transversal Non-Clifford
   Gate Beyond the n1/3 Distance Barrier
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB We construct a family of infinitely many candidate non-Abelian self-correcting topological quantum memories in D >= 5 + 1 spacetime dimensions without particle excitations using local commuting non-Pauli stabilizer lattice models and field theories of Z32 higher-form gauge fields with nontrivial topological action. We call such non-Pauli stabilizer models magic stabilizer codes. The family of topological orders have Abelian electric excitations and non-Abelian magnetic excitations that obey Ising-like fusion rules and non-Abelian braiding, including Borromean ring type braiding which is a signature of non-Abelian topological order, generalizing the dihedral group D8 gauge theory in (2 + 1)D. The simplest example includes a non-Abelian self-correcting memory in (5 + 1)D with Abelian loop excitations and non-Abelian membrane excitations. We prove the self-correction property and the thermal stability and devise a probabilistic local cellular-automaton decoder. We also construct fault-tolerant non-Clifford CCZ logical gate using constant-depth circuits from higher-cup products in the 5D non-Abelian code. The use of higher-cup products and non-Pauli stabilizers allows us to get an O(n2/5) distance overcoming the O(n1/3) distance barrier in conventional topological stabilizer codes, including the 3D color code and the 6D self-correcting color code.

TI Practical multipartite entanglement distribution in noisy channels
SO RESULTS IN PHYSICS
AB Entanglement among multiple parties is vital for practical quantum information applications. As two kinds of typical multipartite entangled state, the W and Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) states have attracted a lot of attention. In this paper, we propose two practical linear optical schemes for multipartite entanglement distribution in noisy channels. Using the time-bin or spatial-mode degree of freedom (DoF) encoding, the influence of the noise will be eliminated and perfect W or GHZ state can be achieved among different nodes in a deterministic way. Moreover, we construct quantum circuits, which can be implemented with current technology. These results contribute to long-distance quantum communication both in theoretical and experimental points of view.

TI Students' view of Quantum Information Technologies, part 3
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ELECTRONICS AND TELECOMMUNICATIONS
AB -The article is part of a course on Quantum Information Technologies QIT conducted at the Faculty of Electronics and Information Technology of the Warsaw University of Technology. The subject includes a publishing workshop exercised engineering students. How do ICT engineers see QIT from their point of view? How can they implement quantum technologies their future work? M.Sc. students usually have strictly declared topics for their master's theses. The implementation of some works is at an advanced stage. The potential areas of application of QIT are defined and narrow if they are to intellectually expand the area of the completed theses. This is the idea incorporating QIT components or interfaces into classic ICT solutions at the software and hardware level. It is possible propose a solution in the form of a functional hybrid system. QIT systems should be functionally incorporated into the existing ICT environment, generating measurable added value. Such a task quite demanding, but practice shows that it interests students. Solutions don't have to be mature or even feasible. They can be dreams of young engineers. The exercise is a publication workshop related to the fast development of QIT. The article a continuation of publication exercises conducted with previous groups of students participating in QIT lectures.

TI Quasiparticle pairing encoding of atomic nuclei for quantum annealing
SO PHYSICS LETTERS B
AB Quantum computing is emerging as a promising tool in nuclear physics. However, the cost of encoding fermionic operators hampers the application of algorithms in current noisy quantum devices. In this work, we analyze an encoding scheme based on pairing nucleon modes. This approach significantly reduces the complexity of the encoding, while maintaining a high accuracy for the ground states of semimagic nuclei across the sd and pf shells and for tin isotopes. In addition, we also explore the encoding ability to describe open-shell nuclei within the above configuration spaces. When this scheme is applied to a trotterized quantum adiabatic evolution, our results demonstrate a computational advantage of up to three orders of magnitude in CNOT gate count compared to the standard Jordan-Wigner encoding. Our approach paves the way for efficient quantum simulations of nuclear structure using quantum annealing, with applications to both digital and hybrid quantum computing platforms.

TI New Quantum Algorithms for Computing Quantum Entropies and Distances
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INFORMATION THEORY
AB We propose a series of quantum algorithms forcomputing a wide range of quantum entropies and distances,including the von Neumann entropy, quantum R & eacute;nyi entropy,trace distance, and fidelity. The proposed algorithms significantlyoutperform the prior best (and even quantum) ones in thelow-rank case, some of which achieve exponential speedups.In particular, forN-dimensional quantum states of rankr, ourproposed quantum algorithms for computing the von Neumannentropy, trace distance and fidelity within additive error epsilon havetime complexity of O(r/epsilon(2)), O(r(5)/epsilon(6))and O(r(6.5)/epsilon(7.5)),respectively. By contrast, prior quantum algorithms for the vonNeumann entropy and trace distance usually have time complex-ity ohm (N), and the prior best one for fidelity has time complexity O(r(12.5)/epsilon(13.5)). The key idea of our quantum algorithms isto extend block-encoding from unitary operators in previouswork to quantum states (i.e., density operators). It is realized bydeveloping several convenient techniques to manipulate quantumstates and extract information from them. The advantage of ourtechniques over the existing methods is that no restrictions ondensity operators are required; in sharp contrast, the previousmethods usually require a lower bound on the minimal non-zeroeigenvalue of density operators

TI Research progress of nonlocal quantum entanglement preparation based on
   quantum multiplexing
SO ACTA PHYSICA SINICA
AB efficiency of generating nonlocal entanglement between distant nodes is severely limited by the exponential loss incurred when locally generated entangled states are distributed through lossy quantum channels. This limitation becomes more pronounced in practical scenarios requiring the simultaneous distribution of multiple entangled pairs. Although classical multiplexing approaches, such as spatial, temporal, and frequency multiplexing, can increase the nonlocal entanglement generation rate, they do not improve the single-shot transmission efficiency. In contrast, quantum multiplexing, which can be generated by high-dimensional encoding of single photons, allows for the parallel generation of multiple nonlocal entangled pairs in a single transmission round, thereby enhancing the overall efficiency of nonlocal entanglement generation. Quantum multiplexing thus presents a promising route toward scalable quantum networks. This review introduces the mechanisms of generating nonlocal entanglement through quantum multiplexing, and focuses on two main methods: using high-dimensional single-photon encoding and high-dimensional biphoton entanglement distribution. Then it examines how quantum multiplexing can accelerate the generation of nonlocal quantum logical entanglement. Finally, it briefly explores the potential of quantum multiplexing for building large-scale

TI Remote sensing and faithful quantum teleportation through non-localized
   qubits
SO PHYSICS LETTERS A
AB One of the most important applications of quantum physics is quantum teleportation, the possibility to transfer quantum states over arbitrary distances. In this paper, we address the idea of remote sensing in a teleportation scenario with topological qubits more robust against noise. We also investigate the enhancement of quantum teleportation through non-local characteristics of the topological qubits. In particular, we show that how this nonlocal property, helps us to achieve near-perfect quantum teleportation even with mixed quantum states. Considering the limitations imposed by decoherence and the subsequent mixedness of the resource state, we find that our results may solve important challenges in realizing faithful teleportation over long distances.

TI Quantum Algorithm for Lexicographically Minimal String Rotation
SO THEORY OF COMPUTING SYSTEMS
AB Lexicographically minimal string rotation (LMSR) is a problem to find the minimal one among all rotations of a string in the lexicographical order, which is widely used in equality checking of graphs, polygons, automata and chemical structures. In this paper, we propose an O(n(3/4)) quantum query algorithm for LMSR. In particular, the algorithm has average-case query complexity O(root n log n), which is shown to be asymptotically optimal up to a polylogarithmic factor, compared to its Omega(root n/log n) lower bound. Furthermore, we show that our quantum algorithm outperforms any (classical) randomized algorithms in both worst and average cases. As an application, it is used in benzenoid identification and disjoint-cycle automata minimization.

TI Genuine three qubit Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen steering under decoherence:
   revealing hidden genuine steerability via pre-processing
SO QUANTUM INFORMATION PROCESSING
AB The behaviour of genuine EPR steering of three qubit states under various environmental noises is investigated. In particular, we consider the two possible steering scenarios in the tripartite setting: (1 -> 2), where Alice demonstrates genuine steering to Bob-Charlie and (2 -> 1), where Alice-Bob together demonstrate genuine steering to Charlie. In both these scenarios, we analyse the genuine steerability of the generalized Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (gGHZ) states or the W-class states under the action of noise modelled by amplitude damping (AD), phase flip (PF), bit flip (BF) and phase damping (PD) channels. In each case, we consider three different interactions with the noise depending upon the number of parties undergoing decoherence. We observed that the tendency to demonstrate genuine steering decreases as the number of parties undergoing decoherence increases from one to three. We have observed several instances where the genuine steerability of the state revives after collapsing if one keeps on increasing the damping. However, hidden genuine steerability of a state cannot be revealed solely from the action of noise. So, the parties having a characterized subsystem perform local pre-processing operations depending upon the steering scenario and the state shared with the dual intent of revealing hidden genuine steerability or enhancing it.

TI Simultaneous discovery of quantum error correction codes and encoders
   with a noise-aware reinforcement learning agent
SO NPJ QUANTUM INFORMATION
AB In the ongoing race towards experimental implementations of quantum error correction (QEC), finding ways to automatically discover codes and encoding strategies tailored to the qubit hardware platform is emerging as a critical problem. Reinforcement learning (RL) has been identified as a promising approach, but so far it has been severely restricted in terms of scalability. In this work, we significantly expand the power of RL approaches to QEC code discovery. Explicitly, we train an RL agent that automatically discovers both QEC codes and their encoding circuits for a given gate set, qubit connectivity and error model, from scratch. This is enabled by a reward based on the Knill-Laflamme conditions and a vectorized Clifford simulator, showing its effectiveness with up to 25 physical qubits and distance 5 codes, while presenting a roadmap to scale this approach to 100 qubits and distance 10 codes in the near future. We also introduce the concept of a noise-aware meta-agent, which learns to produce encoding strategies simultaneously for a range of noise models, thus leveraging transfer of insights between different situations. Our approach opens the door towards hardware-adapted accelerated discovery of QEC approaches across the full spectrum of quantum hardware platforms of interest.

TI Harnessing quantum entanglement and heat current of a non-equilibrium
   spin system at high temperatures
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB The challenge of harnessing entanglement during the non-equilibrium dynamics of open quantum systems, especially at high temperatures, is highly prominent within recent scientific researches. Due to the ongoing trend of miniaturization of quantum devices that exploit quantum correlations, proposing novel schemes to overcome this challenge is itself a crucial task within current quantum technological research. We contribute to this research by proposing a new scheme to control entanglement dynamics of a non-equilibrium two-qubit Heisenberg XXZ spin chain model in an external magnetic field. The design of the scheme is based on a coupling asymmetry in the model induced by the asymmetrical connection of qubits to two independent thermal reservoirs. While in the absence of the coupling asymmetry, non-equilibrium effects generally suppress the dynamical generation of thermal entanglement, making entanglement production impossible at high mean temperatures of reservoirs, it is shown that this asymmetry in the coupling potentially enables us to generate a maximal non-equilibrium entanglement even in the high mean temperature regime. We show that the coupling asymmetry can also lead to a complete protection of the maximum initial entanglement between the qubits at high mean temperatures of the reservoirs thanks to the non-equilibrium conditions. Depending on the initial state of the two qubits, this can be achieved either by accessing a coherence-free subspace or by fully reviving the initial qubit-qubit entanglement. Furthermore, we investigate the quantum heat transport of the chain, and find that by turning on the asymmetry in the qubit-reservoir coupling, although the chain loses its initial thermal rectification property over time, it regains this property and maintain it until the non-equilibrium steady state is reached. Our results show that, at higher temperature gradients, the chain leverages the steady-state entanglement to completely block the heat released from the hot reservoir. Our findings can be significant for heat management in quantum computing devices such as solid-state thermal circuits.

TI Quantum Computing for Transport Network Optimization
SO ENTROPY
AB Public transport systems play a crucial role in the development of large cities. Bus network design to optimize passenger flow coverage in a global metropolis is a challenging task. As an essential part of bus travel planning, considering the bus transfer factor in the existing extremely complex and extensive public bus network usually leads to a optimization problem characterized by high-dimensionality and non-linearity. While classical computers struggle to deal with this kind of problems, quantum computers shed new light into this field. The coherent Ising machine (CIM), a specialized optical quantum computer using a photonic dissipative architecture, has shown its remarkable computational power in combinatorial optimization problems. We construct the classical model and the quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO) model of the bus route optimization problem, and solve it using a classical computer and CIM, respectively. Our experimental results demonstrate the significant acceleration capability of CIM over classical computers in finding the optimal or near-optimal solutions, albeit subject to the hardware limitations of the 100-qubit CIM.

TI A Resource-Efficient 4-Qubit Circuit for Bit-Flip Error Correction Using
   Feynman Gates
SO QUANTUM INFORMATION & COMPUTATION
AB Quantum systems are inherently prone to errors caused by decoherence, noise, and imperfect gate operations. Effective error correction is essential to preserving quantum information, especially under hardware constraints. In this paper, we present a resource-efficient 4-qubit quantum circuit designed to detect and correct single-qubit bit-flip errors within a 3-qubit data block. The circuit uses Feynman (CNOT) and NOT gates alongside an ancillary qubit to implement full correction logic with minimal overhead. Compared to well-known approaches like the 9-qubit Shor code, our design achieves equivalent fidelity (100%) using fewer qubits, making it highly suitable for near-term quantum devices. Simulation results, obtained using IBM Quantum Composer and Qiskit, confirm the circuit's correctness and reliability across all bit-flip scenarios. The design also introduces a reusable unitary block for efficient implementation. This work offers a scalable and practical solution to quantum error correction using minimal hardware resources.

TI Equivalence Checking of Sequential Quantum Circuits
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON COMPUTER-AIDED DESIGN OF INTEGRATED CIRCUITS AND
   SYSTEMS
AB We define a formal framework for equivalence checking of sequential quantum circuits. The model we adopt is a quantum state machine, which is a natural quantum generalization of Mealy machines. A major difficulty in checking quantum circuits (but not present in checking classical circuits) is that the state spaces of quantum circuits are continuums. This difficulty is resolved by our main theorem showing that equivalence checking of two quantum Mealy machines can be done with input sequences that are taken from some chosen basis (which are finite) and have a length quadratic in the dimensions of the state Hilbert spaces of the machines. Based on this theoretical result, we develop an (and to the best of our knowledge, the first) algorithm for checking equivalence of sequential quantum circuits with running time O(23(m+5l)(2(3m)( )+ 2(3l))), where m and l denote the numbers of input and internal qubits, respectively. The complexity of our algorithm is comparable with that of the known algorithms for checking classical sequential circuits in the sense that both are exponential in the number of (qu)bits. Several case studies and experiments are presented.

TI Quantifying the entanglement of quantum channel
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB To describe the nonclassicality of quantum channels, it is necessary to quantify their properties. In the framework of resource theory of quantum channel, we present three new entanglement measures of channels for a quantum system of arbitrary finite dimension, based on the Choi relative entropy of channels, concurrence, and k-ME concurrence, respectively. Rigorous proofs show that these proposed measures fulfill all the requirements dictated by the resource theory of quantum channels, including non-negativity, weak monotonicity, strong monotone, convexity, additivity, and subadditivity. By using the measure, we describe the probability that the initial hypothesis is true in the hypothesis testing of channels. Compared with other known measures of the quantum channels, these measures have an obvious advantage in computability. According to the power of generating entanglement, we give a classification of quantum channels. Moreover, we provide several examples that characterize the properties of quantum channels and the conversions between quantum coherence states and entangled states and between fully separable states and multipartite entangled states.

AB Neutral atom arrays, particularly the reconfigurable field programmable qubit arrays (FPQA) with atom movement, show strong promise for quantum computing. FPQA has a dynamic qubit connectivity, facilitating cost-effective execution of long-range gates, but it also poses new challenges in the compilation. Inspired by the FPGA compilation strategy, we develop a router, Q-Pilot, that leverages flying ancillas to implement 2-Q gates between data qubits mapped to fixed atoms. Equipped with domain-specific routing techniques, Q-Pilot achieves 1.4x, 27.7x, and 6.7x reductions in circuit depth for 100qubit random, quantum simulation, and QAOA circuits, respectively, compared to alternative fixed atom array architectures.

AB In quantum networks multipath entanglement purification (MEP) between a pair of source-destination nodes can substantially strengthen their entanglement connection. An efficient MEP strategy can therefore increase the size of the network region where bipartite entanglement based quantum information processing tasks can be implemented. Here, we analyse MEP in a general model of a quantum network and obtain design criteria for efficient MEP strategies. Further, by simulating two different MEP strategies, based on these criteria, on different underlying network topologies we explore how the topology determines the effectiveness of a fixed MEP strategy. Finally, we show that a careful choice of MEP strategy can make the entanglement connection strength between source-destination network nodes effectively independent of its topology. Our results can therefore provide a useful guide for the design of quantum networks and entanglement distribution protocols.

TI Optimized Implementation and Analysis of CHAM in Quantum Computing
SO APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL
AB A quantum computer capable of running the Grover search algorithm, which reduces the complexity of brute-force attacks by a square root, has the potential to undermine the security strength of symmetric-key cryptography and hash functions. Recently, studies on quantum approaches have proposed analyzing potential quantum attacks using the Grover search algorithm in conjunction with optimized quantum circuit implementations for symmetric-key cryptography and hash functions. Analyzing quantum attacks on a cipher (i.e., quantum cryptanalysis) and estimating the necessary quantum resources are related to evaluating post-quantum security for the target cryptography algorithms. In this paper, we revisit quantum implementations of CHAM block cipher, an ultra lightweight cipher, with a focus on optimizing the linear operations in its key schedule. We optimized the linear equations of CHAM as matrices by applying novel optimized decomposition techniques. Using the improved CHAM quantum circuits, we estimate the cost of Grover's key search and evaluate the post-quantum security strength with further reduced costs.

TI Experimental demonstration of long distance quantum communication with
   independent heralded single photon sources
SO NPJ QUANTUM INFORMATION
AB Hong-Ou-Mandel interference is essential for various quantum communication protocols, including quantum teleportation, entanglement swapping, and measurement-device-independent (MDI) quantum key distribution (QKD). A significant challenge is producing single photons that remain indistinguishable over long distances. Time jitter introduced in synchronization between remote nodes reduces temporal overlap, making photons no longer indistinguishable. To mitigate this effect, previous solutions are forced to increase the temporal overlap, typically by using narrowband filtering strategies to extend photon coherence time. However, this dramatically decreases photon rates, making them impractical for real-life applications. Here we address this dilemma by employing common laser pulses to generate intrinsically synchronized single photons, eliminating the need for extended coherence time. Without compromising photon indistinguishability, we achieved a four-fold coincidence count rate more than two orders of magnitude higher than previous methods over 50 kilometers of fiber transmission. This breakthrough enabled the implementation of MDI-QKD with passive decoy states, demonstrating the viability of our approach.

TI From classical to quantum machine learning: survey on routing
   optimization in 6G software defined networking
SO FRONTIERS IN COMMUNICATIONS AND NETWORKS
AB The sixth generation (6G) of mobile networks will adopt on-demand self-reconfiguration to fulfill simultaneously stringent key performance indicators and overall optimization of usage of network resources. Such dynamic and flexible network management is made possible by Software Defined Networking (SDN) with a global view of the network, centralized control, and adaptable forwarding rules. Because of the complexity of 6G networks, Artificial Intelligence and its integration with SDN and Quantum Computing are considered prospective solutions to hard problems such as optimized routing in highly dynamic and complex networks. The main contribution of this survey is to present an in-depth study and analysis of recent research on the application of Reinforcement Learning (RL), Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL), and Quantum Machine Learning (QML) techniques to address SDN routing challenges in 6G networks. Furthermore, the paper identifies and discusses open research questions in this domain. In summary, we conclude that there is a significant shift toward employing RL/DRL-based routing strategies in SDN networks, particularly over the past 3 years. Moreover, there is a huge interest in integrating QML techniques to tackle the complexity of routing in 6G networks. However, considerable work remains to be done in both approaches in order to accomplish thorough comparisons and synergies among various approaches and conduct meaningful evaluations using open datasets and different topologies.

TI Constructing a ball of separable and absolutely separable states for 2 ⊗
   d quantum system
SO EUROPEAN PHYSICAL JOURNAL D
AB Absolute separable states is a kind of separable state that remain separable under the action of any global unitary transformation. These states may or may not have quantum correlation and these correlations can be measured by quantum discord. We find that the absolute separable states are useful in quantum computation even if it contains infinitesimal quantum correlation in it. Thus to search for the class of two-qubit absolute separable states with zero discord, we have derived an upper bound for Tr(rho(2)), where rho denoting all zero discord states. In general, the upper bound depends on the state under consideration but if the state belong to some particular class of zero discord states then we found that the upper bound is state independent. Later, it is shown that among these particular classes of zero discord states, there exist sub-classes which are absolutely separable. Furthermore, we have derived necessary conditions for the separability of a given qubit-qudit states. Then, we used the derived conditions to construct a ball for 2 circle times d quantum system described by Tr(rho(2)) <= Tr(X-2) + 2Tr(X Z) + Tr(Z(2)), where the 2 circle times d quantum system is described by the density operator p which can be expressed by block matrices X,Y and Z with X, Z >= 0. In particular, for qubit-qudit system, we show that the newly constructed ball contain larger class of absolute separable states compared to the ball described by Tr(rho(2)) <= 1/3. Lastly, we have derived the necessary condition in terms of purity for the absolute separability of a qubit-qudit system under investigation.

TI Proposal for practical Rydberg quantum gates using a native two-photon
   excitation
SO QUANTUM SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB Rydberg quantum gate serving as an indispensable computing unit for neutral-atom quantum computation, has attracted intense research efforts for the last decade. However, the state-of-the-art experiments have not reached the high gate fidelity as predicted by most theories due to the unexpected large loss remaining in Rydberg and intermediate states. In this paper, we report our findings in constructing a native two-qubit controlled-NOT gate based on pulse optimization. We focus on the method of commonly-used two-photon Rydberg excitation with smooth Gaussian-shaped pulses which is straightforward for experimental demonstration. By utilizing optimized pulse shapes the scheme reveals a remarkable reduction in the decays from Rydberg and intermediate states, as well as a high-tolerance to the residual thermal motion of atoms. We extract a conservative lower bound for the gate fidelity >0.9921 after taking into account the experimental imperfections. Our results not only reduce the gap between experimental and theoretical prediction because of the optimal control, but also facilitate the connectivity of distant atomic qubits in a larger atom array by reducing the requirement of strong blockade, which is promising for developing multiqubit quantum computation in large-scale atomic arrays.

TI Industry-compatible silicon spin-qubit unit cells exceeding 99% fidelity
SO NATURE
AB Among the many types of qubit presently being investigated for a future quantum computer, silicon spin qubits with millions of qubits on a single chip are uniquely positioned to enable quantum computing. However, it has not been clear whether the outstanding high-fidelity operations and long coherence times shown by silicon spin qubits fabricated in academic settings1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7-8 can be reliably reproduced when the qubits are manufactured in a semiconductor foundry9, 10-11. Here we show precise qubit operation of silicon two-qubit devices made with standard semiconductor tooling in a 300-mm foundry environment. Of the key metrics, single- and two-qubit control fidelities exceed 99% for all four devices, and the state preparation and measurement fidelities reach up to 99.9%, as evidenced by gate set tomography.

AB Quantum automata can solve certain problems with a smaller state space than classical automata. We developed a quantum finite automaton using ternary rotation quantum gates and the Chrestenson family of ternary quantum gates. The main idea of this paper is to show how to combine rotation ternary quantum circuit-based Quantum Finite Automaton and quantum reversible circuit-based Deterministic Finite Automaton to build a more powerful machine. The combined machine can enable more complex language and pattern recognition. The developed quantum finite automaton and resulting combined machine can be used for robotics applications such as language, gesture, and motion recognition.

TI Fast universal control of an oscillator with weak dispersive coupling to
   a qubit
SO NATURE PHYSICS
AB Full manipulation of a quantum system requires controlled evolution generated by nonlinear interactions, which is coherent when the rate of nonlinearity is large compared with the rate of decoherence. As a result, engineered quantum systems typically rely on a bare nonlinearity much stronger than decoherence rates, and this hierarchy is usually assumed to be necessary. Here we challenge this assumption by demonstrating the universal control of a quantum system where the rate of bare nonlinear interaction is comparable to the fastest rate of decoherence. We introduce a noise-resilient protocol for the universal quantum control of a nearly harmonic oscillator that takes advantage of an in situ enhanced nonlinearity instead of harnessing a bare nonlinearity. Our experiment consists of a high-quality-factor microwave cavity with weak dispersive coupling to a superconducting qubit with much lower quality. By using strong drives to temporarily excite the oscillator, we realize an amplified three-wave-mixing interaction, achieving typical operation speeds over an order of magnitude faster than expected from the bare dispersive coupling. Our demonstrations include the preparation of a single-photon state with high fidelity, the generation of squeezed vacuum with large intracavity squeezing and measurement-free preparation of logical states for the binomial and Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill quantum error-correcting codes.
   A noise-resilient protocol implemented in a cavity resonator coupled to a qubit demonstrates that large nonlinear couplings are not a necessary requirement for the fast universal control and state preparation of engineered quantum systems.

SO IET QUANTUM COMMUNICATION
AB Integration of Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) in existing telecommunication infrastructure is crucial for the widespread adoption of this quantum technology that offers the distillation of unconditionally secure keys between users. The authors report a field trial between the Points of Presence placed in Treviso and in Venezia-Mestre, Italy, exploiting the QuKy commercial polarisation-based QKD platforms developed by ThinkQuantum S.r.l. and two different standards of single-mode optical fibres, that is, G.652 and G.655 as a quantum channel. In this field trial, several configurations were tested, including the co-existence of classical and quantum signals over the same fibre, providing a direct comparison between the performances of the G.652 and G.655 fibre standards for QKD applications.
   The authors compare the performance of a commercially available polarisation-based quantum key distribution (QKD) system in two parallel deployed fibres that employ two different standards, that is, G.652 and G.655, and in two different configurations, that is, dark-fibre and classical-quantum coexistence. This is a unique opportunity since the fibres are subject to the same environmental conditions, following the same route between the Points of Presence in Treviso and Venice-Mestre, Italy. image

TI Network-Assisted Collective Operations for Efficient Distributed Quantum
   Computing
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON QUANTUM ENGINEERING
AB Distributed quantum computing relies on coordinated operations between remote quantum processing units (QPUs), yet most existing work either assumes full connectivity, unrealistic for large networks, or relies on entanglement swapping. To mitigate the overhead of communication, we propose a scheme for the distribution of collective quantum operations among remote QPUs by exploiting distributed fan-out operations to a central node in network architectures similar to those used for high-performance computing, which requires only preshared entanglement, local operations, and classical communication. We show that a general diagonal gate can be distributed among any number of nodes and provide the ebit cost bounds. For a single distributed multicontrolled gate, this amounts to a single additional Bell pair over the theoretically optimal calculation with all-to-all preshared entanglement, demonstrating better scalability when compared to current proposals based on entanglement swapping through a network. We provide a recipe for the lumped distribution of gates, such as arbitrarily sized Toffoli and multicontrolled Z and $R_{zz}(\theta)$ gates. Finally, we provide an exact implementation of a distributed Grover's search algorithm using this protocol to partition the circuit, with Bell pair cost growing linearly with the number of Grover iterations and the number of partitions, and show how these techniques can be applied to other algorithms, such as quantum approximate optimization algorithm. Our results show that alternative approaches to entanglement swapping can provide major benefits in distributed quantum computing, pointing to promising avenues for future research.

TI Pathways for Entanglement-Based Quantum Communication in the Face of
   High Noise
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB Entanglement-based quantum communication offers an increased level of security in practical secret shared key distribution. One of the fundamental principles enabling this security-the fact that interfering with one photon will destroy entanglement and thus be detectable-is also the greatest obstacle. Random encounters of traveling photons, losses, and technical imperfections make noise an inevitable part of any quantum communication scheme, severely limiting distance, key rate, and environmental conditions in which quantum key distribution can be employed. Using photons entangled in their spatial degree of freedom, we show that the increased noise resistance of high-dimensional entanglement can indeed be harnessed for practical key distribution schemes. We perform quantum key distribution in eight entangled paths at various levels of environmental noise and show key rates that, even after error correction and privacy amplification, still exceed 1 bit per photon pair and furthermore certify a secure key at noise levels that would prohibit comparable qubit based schemes from working.

TI The Evaluation of Software Security through Quantum Computing
   Techniques: A Durability Perspective
SO APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL
AB The primary goal of this research study, in the field of information technology (IT), is to improve the security and durability of software. A quantum computing-based security algorithm springs quite a lot of symmetrical approaches and procedures to ensure optimum software retreat. The accurate assessment of software's durability and security is a dynamic aspect in assessing, administrating, and controlling security for strengthening the features of security. This paper essentially emphasises the demarcation and depiction of quantum computing from a software security perspective. At present, different symmetrical-based cryptography approaches or algorithms are being used to protect different government and non-government sectors, such as banks, healthcare sectors, defense, transport, automobiles, navigators, weather forecasting, etc., to ensure software durability and security. However, many crypto schemes are likely to collapse when a large qubit-based quantum computer is developed. In such a scenario, it is necessary to pay attention to the security alternatives based on quantum computing. Presently, the different factors of software durability are usability, dependability, trustworthiness, and human trust. In this study, we have also classified the durability level in the second stage. The intention of the evaluation of the impact on security over quantum duration is to estimate and assess the security durability of software. In this research investigation, we have followed the symmetrical hybrid technique of fuzzy analytic hierarchy process (FAHP) and fuzzy technique for order of preference by similarity to ideal solution (FTOPSIS). The obtained results, and the method used in this estimation, would make a significant contribution to future research for organising software security and durability (SSD) in the presence of a quantum computer.

TI Benchmarking characterization methods for noisy quantum circuits
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Effective methods for characterizing the noise in quantum computing devices are essential for programming and debugging circuit performance. Existing approaches vary in the information obtained as well as the amount of quantum and classical resources required, with more information generally requiring more resources. Here we benchmark the characterization methods of gate set tomography, Pauli channel noise reconstruction, and empirical direct characterization for developing models that describe noisy quantum circuit performance on a 27-qubit superconducting transmon device. We evaluate these models by comparing the accuracy of noisy circuit simulations with the corresponding experimental observations. We find that the agreement of noise model to experiment does not correlate with the information gained by characterization and that the underlying circuit strongly influences the best choice of characterization approach. Empirical direct characterization scales best of the methods we tested and produced the most accurate characterizations across our benchmarks.

TI Shortcut-to-Adiabatic Controlled-Phase Gate in Rydberg Atoms
SO ANNALEN DER PHYSIK
AB A shortcut-to-adiabatic protocol for the realization of a fast and high-fidelity controlled-phase gate in Rydberg atoms is developed. The adiabatic state transfer, driven in the high-blockade limit, is sped up by compensating nonadiabatic transitions via oscillating fields that mimic a counterdiabatic Hamiltonian. High fidelities are obtained in wide parameter regions. The implementation of the bare effective counterdiabatic field, without original adiabatic pulses, enables to bypass gate errors produced by the accumulation of blockade-dependent dynamical phases, making the protocol efficient also at low blockade values. As an application toward quantum algorithms, how the fidelity of the gate impacts the efficiency of a minimal quantum-error correction circuit is analyzed.

TI Non-Pauli topological stabilizer codes from twisted quantum doubles
SO QUANTUM
AB It has long been known that long-ranged entangled topological phases can be exploited to protect quantum information against unwanted local errors. Indeed, conditions for intrinsic topological order are reminiscent of criteria for faithful quantum error correction. At the same time, the promise of using general topological orders for practical error correction remains largely unfulfilled to date. In this work, we significantly contribute to establishing such a connection by showing that Abelian twisted quantum double models can be used for quantum error correction. By exploiting the group cohomological data sitting at the heart of these lattice models, we transmute the terms of these Hamiltonians into full-rank, pairwise commuting operators, defining commuting stabilizers. The resulting codes are defined by commuting non-Pauli stabilizers, with local systems that can either be qubits or higher dimensional quantum systems. Thus, this work establishes a new connection between condensed matter physics and quantum information theory, and constructs tools to systematically devise new topological quantum error correcting codes beyond toric or surface code models.

TI Locally suppressed transverse-field protocol for diabatic quantum
   annealing
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Diabatic quantum annealing (DQA) is an alternative algorithm to adiabatic quantum annealing that can be used to circumvent the exponential slowdown caused by small minima in the annealing energy spectrum. We present the locally suppressed transverse-field (LSTF) protocol, a heuristic method for making stoquastic optimization problems compatible with DQA. We show that, provided an optimization problem intrinsically has magnetic frustration due to inhomogeneous local fields, a target qubit in the problem can always be manipulated to create a double minimum in the energy gap between the ground and first excited states during the evolution of the algorithm. Such a double energy minimum can be exploited to induce diabatic transitions to the first excited state and back to the ground state. In addition to its relevance to classical and quantum algorithmic speedups, the LSTF protocol enables DQA proof-of-principle and physics experiments to be performed on existing hardware, provided independent controls exist for the transverse qubit magnetization fields. We discuss the implications on the coherence requirements of the quantum annealing hardware when using the LSTF protocol, considering specifically the cases of relaxation and dephasing. We show that the relaxation rate of a large system can be made to depend only on the target qubit, presenting opportunities for the characterization of the decohering environment in a quantum annealing processor.

TI Verifiable distributed blind quantum computation
SO SCIENTIA SINICA-PHYSICA MECHANICA & ASTRONOMICA
AB Blind quantum computation (BQC) enables clients with limited quantum capabilities to delegate computational tasks to remote quantum servers while maintaining the privacy of inputs, outputs, and algorithms. However, in the NISQ era, servers cannot perform large-scale quantum computing tasks due to the constraints of the size and performance of quantum computers. Therefore, this paper proposes a distributed BQC protocol based on the measurement model to increase the possibility of implementing some tasks of larger size. The proposed protocol divides the brickwork resource states into two types of small-scale quantum resource states, which are subsequently entangled by using the optimized non-local CZ operations to construct a larger-scale quantum resource state. This approach can significantly reduce the burden on a single quantum server. Notably, the implementation of the optimized non-local CZ operation only requires pre-sharing a pair of Bell states without the need for classical communication between servers, which may boost the parallelism of delegated computation. In addition, the protocol also realizes verifiability by embedding trap qubits. Finally, a replacement strategy for any quantum server is suggested in anticipation of possible periodic maintenance of quantum servers in the future.

TI Quantifying protocol efficiency: A thermodynamic figure of merit for
   classical and quantum state-transfer protocols
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Manipulating quantum systems undergoing non-Gaussian dynamics in a fast and accurate manner is becoming fundamental to many quantum applications. Here, we focus on classical and quantum protocols transferring a state across a double-well potential. The classical protocols are achieved by deforming the potential, while the quantum ones are assisted by a counterdiabatic driving. We show that quantum protocols perform more quickly and accurately. Finally, we design a figure of merit for the performance of the transfer protocols-namely, the protocol grading-that depends only on fundamental physical quantities, and which accounts for the quantum speed limit, the fidelity, and the thermodynamics of the process. We test the protocol grading with classical and quantum protocols, and show that quantum protocols have higher protocol grading than the classical ones.

TI Towards fault-tolerant distributed quantum computation (FT-DQC):
   Taxonomy, recent progress, and challenges
SO ICT EXPRESS
AB As the works on quantum computing have seen substantial development in recent years, we are on the verge of seeing the fruitful result of the preliminary, early version of quantum computers. Nevertheless, in order to achieve full-fledged, large-scale quantum computers, two aspects still lacking in the existing quantum computers, i.e., scalability and reliability, will need to be more carefully considered and investigated. In this survey, we present a review of existing literature that aims to alleviate the scalability and reliability issues in quantum computers. In particular, we discuss how existing research leads to two main solutions: for advancing scalability, a distributed quantum computing (DQC) paradigm will be the primary direction instead of the general centralized quantum computing (CQC), whereas for attaining reliability, a fault-tolerant quantum computation (FTQC) approach would need to be leveraged instead of the existing noisy intermediatescale quantum computers (NISQ). Combining both solutions, we highlight the essentiality of fault-tolerant distributed quantum computation (FT-DQC) and present related progress in the field. Furthermore, from the papers that we have gathered, we provide the taxonomy of the works to give a clearer landscape of the field and discuss the key issues in realizing FT-DQC.

TI Quantum Deep Reinforcement Learning for Robot Navigation Tasks
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB We utilize hybrid quantum deep reinforcement learning to learn navigation tasks for a simple, wheeled robot in simulated environments of increasing complexity. For this, we train parameterized quantum circuits (PQCs) with two different encoding strategies in a hybrid quantum-classical setup as well as a classical neural network baseline with the double deep Q network (DDQN) reinforcement learning algorithm. Quantum deep reinforcement learning (QDRL) has previously been studied in several relatively simple benchmark environments, mainly from the OpenAI gym suite. However, scaling behavior and applicability of QDRL to more demanding tasks closer to real-world problems e.g., from the robotics domain, have not been studied previously. Here, we show that quantum circuits in hybrid quantum-classic reinforcement learning setups are capable of learning optimal policies in multiple robotic navigation scenarios with notably fewer trainable parameters compared to a classical baseline. Across a large number of experimental configurations, we find that the employed quantum circuits outperform the classical neural network baselines when equating for the number of trainable parameters. Yet, the classical neural network consistently showed better results concerning training times and stability, with at least one order of magnitude of trainable parameters more than the best-performing quantum circuits. However, validating the robustness of the learning methods in a large and dynamic environment, we find that the classical baseline produces more stable and better performing policies overall. For the two encoding schemes, we observed better results for consecutively encoding the classical state vector on each qubit compared to encoding each component on a separate qubit. Our findings demonstrate that current hybrid quantum machine-learning approaches can be scaled to simple robotic problems while yielding sufficient results, at least in an idealized simulated setting, but there are yet open questions regarding the application to considerably more demanding tasks. We anticipate that our work will contribute to introducing quantum machine learning in general and quantum deep reinforcement learning in particular to more demanding problem domains and emphasize the importance of encoding techniques for classic data in hybrid quantum-classical settings.

AB Instruction scheduling is a key compiler optimization in quantum computing, just as it is for classical computing. Current schedulers optimize for data parallelism by allowing simultaneous execution of instructions, as long as their qubits do not overlap. However, on many quantum hardware platforms, instructions on overlapping qubits can be executed simultaneously through global interactions. For example, while fan-out in traditional quantum circuits can only be implemented sequentially when viewed at the logical level, global interactions at the physical level allow fan-out to be achieved in one step. We leverage this simultaneous fan-out primitive to optimize circuit synthesis for NISQ (Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum) workloads. In addition, we introduce novel quantum memory architectures based on fan-out.
   Our work also addresses hardware implementation of the fan-out primitive. We perform realistic simulations for trapped ion quantum computers. We also demonstrate experimental proof-of-concept of fan-out with superconducting qubits. We perform depth (runtime) and fidelity estimation for NISQ application circuits and quantum memory architectures under realistic noise models. Our simulations indicate promising results with an asymptotic advantage in runtime, as well as 7-24% reduction in error.

TI Uncomputation in the Qrisp High-Level Quantum Programming Framework
SO REVERSIBLE COMPUTATION, RC 2023
SE Lecture Notes in Computer Science
CT 15th International Conference on Reversible Computation (RC)
CY JUL 18-19, 2023
CL Giessen, GERMANY
AB Uncomputation is an essential part of reversible computing and plays a vital role in quantum computing. Using this technique, memory resources can be safely deallocated without performing a nonreversible deletion process. For the case of quantum computing, several algorithms depend on this as they require disentangled states in the course of their execution. Thus, uncomputation is not only about resource management, but is also required from an algorithmic point of view. However, synthesizing uncomputation circuits is tedious and can be automated. In this paper, we describe the interface for automated generation of uncomputation circuits in our Qrisp framework. Our algorithm for synthesizing uncomputation circuits in Qrisp is based on an improved version of "Unqomp", a solution presented by Paradis et al. Our paper also presents some improvements to the original algorithm, in order to make it suitable for the needs of a high-level programming framework. Qrisp itself is a fully compilable, high-level programming language/framework for gate-based quantum computers, which abstracts from many of the underlying hardware details. Qrisp's goal is to support a high-level programming paradigm as known from classical software development.

TI A quantum computing concept for 1-D elastic wave simulation with
   exponential speedup
SO GEOPHYSICAL JOURNAL INTERNATIONAL
AB Quantum computing has attracted considerable attention in recent years because it promises speedups that conventional supercomputers cannot offer, at least for some applications. Though existing quantum computers (QCs) are, in most cases, still too small to solve significant problems, their future impact on domain sciences is already being explored now. Within this context, we present a quantum computing concept for 1-D elastic wave propagation in heterogeneous media with two components: a theoretical formulation and an implementation on a real QC. The method rests on a finite-difference approximation, followed by a sparsity-preserving transformation of the discrete elastic wave equation to a Schr & ouml;dinger equation, which can be simulated directly on a gate-based QC. An implementation on an error-free quantum simulator verifies our approach and forms the basis of numerical experiments with small problems on the real QC IBM Brisbane. The latter produce simulation results that qualitatively agree with the error-free version but are contaminated by quantum decoherence and noise effects. Complementing the discrete transformation to the Schr & ouml;dinger equation by a continuous version allows the replacement of finite differences by other spatial discretization schemes, such as the spectral-element method. Anticipating the emergence of error-corrected quantum chips, we analyse the computational complexity of the best quantum simulation algorithms for future QCs. This analysis suggests that our quantum computing approach may lead to wavefield simulations that run exponentially faster than simulations on classical computers.

TI Experimental protocol for qubit-environment entanglement detection
SO AVS QUANTUM SCIENCE
AB Decoherence is a manifestation of the coupling of a system with its environment. The resulting loss of information can hamper the functioning of quantum devices; hence, there is a need to understand its origin and dynamics. Decoherence can stem from entanglement, but it can also be classical in nature. Indeed, methods have been developed to understand whether qubit-environment entanglement (QEE) is actually present in some important classes of quantum channels-pure dephasing. Their practicality resides in the fact that they only require accessing the system qubit. In this paper, we show an implementation of this technique in a photonic quantum channel simulator via a scheme that has been tailored to the system under study. By controlling the input state of the environment in our simulation, we can check the occurrence of qubit environment entanglement in simple, yet insightful test cases. Our results showcase the usefulness and experimental relevance of the QEE witnessing technique.

TI Is Quantum Advantage the Right Goal for Quantum Machine Learning?
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB Machine learning is frequently listed among the most promising applications for quantum computing. This is in fact a curious choice: the machine-learning algorithms of today are notoriously powerful in practice but remain theoretically difficult to study. Quantum computing, in contrast, does not offer practical benchmarks on realistic scales and theory is the main tool we have to judge whether it could become relevant for a problem. In this perspective, we explain why it is so difficult to say something about the practical power of quantum computers for machine learning with the tools we are currently using. We argue that these challenges call for a critical debate on whether quantum advantage and that the narrative of "beating" classical machine learning should continue to dominate the literature in the way it does, and highlight examples for how other perspectives in existing research provide an important alternative to the focus on advantage.

AB The advanced Quantum Information Technologies subject for Ph.D. students in Electronics Engineering and ICT consists of three parts. A few review lectures concentrate on topics which may be of interest for the students due to their fields of research done individually in their theses. The lectures indicate the diversity of the QIT field, resting on physics and applied mathematics, but possessing wide application range in quantum computing, communications and metrology. The individual IQT seminars prepared by Ph.D. students are as closely related to their real theses as possible. Important part of the seminar is a discussion among the students. The task was to enrich, possibly with a quantum layer, the current research efforts in ICT. And to imagine, what value such a quantum enrichment adds to the research. The result is sometimes astonishing, especially in such cases when quantum layer may be functionally deeply embedded. The final part was to write a short paragraph to a common paper related to individual quantum layer addition to the own research. The paper presents some results of such experiment and is a continuation of previous papers of the same style.

TI Perturbative variational quantum algorithms for material simulations
SO ELECTRONIC STRUCTURE
AB Reducing circuit depth is essential for implementing quantum simulations of electronic structure on near-term quantum devices. In this work, we propose a variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) based perturbation theory (PT) algorithm to accurately simulate electron correlation of periodic materials with shallow ansatz circuits, which are generated from adaptive derivative-assembled pseudo-trotter or qubit-excitation-based VQE calculations using a loose convergence criteria. Here, the major part of the electron correlation is described using the VQE ansatz circuit and the remaining correlation energy is described by either multireference or similarity transformation-based PT. Numerical results demonstrate that the new algorithms are able to accurately describe electron correlation of the LiH crystal with only one circuit parameter, in contrast with similar to 30 parameters required in the adaptive VQE to achieve the same accuracy. Meanwhile, for fixed-depth ansatze, e.g. unitary coupled cluster, we demonstrate that the VQE-based PT provides an appealing scheme to improve their accuracy.

TI Quantum error correction with the color-Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill code
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB The Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill (GKP) code is an important type of bosonic quantum error-correcting code. Since the GKP code only protects against small shift errors in p<SIC> and q<SIC> quadratures, it is necessary to concatenate the GKP code with a stabilizer code for the larger error correction. In this paper, we consider the concatenation of the single-mode GKP code with the two-dimensional (2D) color code (color-GKP code) on the square-octagon lattice. We use the Steane-type scheme with a maximum-likelihood estimation for GKP error correction and show its advantage for the concatenation. In our main paper, the minimum-weight perfect matching algorithm is applied to decode the color-GKP code. Complemented with the continuous-variable information from the GKP code, the threshold of the 2D color code is improved. If only data GKP qubits are noisy, the threshold reaches sigma approximate to 0.59( p over bar approximate to 13.3%) compared with p over bar = 10.2% of the normal 2D color code. If measurements are also noisy, we introduce the generalized restriction decoder on the three-dimensional space-time graph for decoding. The threshold reaches sigma approximate to 0.46 when measurements in the GKP error correction are noiseless, and sigma approximate to 0.24 when all measurements are noisy. Lastly, the good performance of the generalized restriction decoder is also shown on the normal 2D color code giving the threshold at 3.1% under the phenomenological error model.

TI Routing and Wavelength Assignment in Hybrid Networks With Classical and
   Quantum Signals
SO IEEE JOURNAL ON SELECTED AREAS IN COMMUNICATIONS
AB Quantum Key Distribution has become a mature quantum technology that has outgrown dedicated links and is ready to be incorporated into the classical infrastructure. In this scenario with multiple potential nodes, it is crucial having efficient ways to allocate the network resources between all the potential users. We propose a simple method for routing and wavelength assignment in wavelength multiplexed networks in which classical and quantum channels coexist. The proposed heuristics take into account the specific requirements of quantum key distribution and focus on keeping at bay the contamination of the quantum channels by photons coming from the classical signals from non-linear processes, among others. These heuristics reduce the shared path between classical and quantum channels and improve the signal-to-noise ratio in the quantum channels, improving their quantum key rate. We compare the results to the usual classical RWA approach.

AB The intrinsic quantum nature of jets and the Quark-Gluon Plasma makes the study of jet quenching a promising candidate to benefit from quantum computing power. Standing as a precursor of the full study of this phenomenon, we study the propagation of SU(3) partons in Quark-Gluon Plasma using quantum simulation algorithms. The algorithms are developed in detail, and the propagation of both quarks and gluons is analysed and compared with analytical expectations. The results, obtained with quantum simulators, demonstrate that the algorithm successfully simulates parton propagation, yielding results consistent with analytical baseline calculations.

TI Classical splitting of parametrized quantum circuits
SO QUANTUM MACHINE INTELLIGENCE
AB Barren plateaus appear to be a major obstacle for using variational quantum algorithms to simulate large-scale quantum systems or to replace traditional machine learning algorithms. They can be caused by multiple factors such as the expressivity of the ansatz, excessive entanglement, the locality of observables under consideration, or even hardware noise. We propose classical splitting of parametric ansatz circuits to avoid barren plateaus. Classical splitting is realized by subdividing an N qubit ansatz into multiple ansatze that consist of O(log N) qubits. We show that such an approach allows for avoiding barren plateaus and carry out numerical experiments, and perform binary classification on classical and quantum datasets. Moreover, we propose an extension of the ansatz that is compatible with variational quantum simulations. Finally, we discuss a speed-up for gradient-based optimization and hardware implementation, robustness against noise and parallelization, making classical splitting an ideal tool for noisy intermediate scale quantum (NISQ) applications.

AB Quantum Computing (QC) is a research field that has been in the limelight in recent years. In fact, many researchers and practitioners believe that it can provide benefits in terms of efficiency and effectiveness when employed to solve certain computationally intensive tasks. In Information Retrieval (IR) and Recommender Systems (RS) we are required to process very large and heterogeneous datasets by means of complex operations, it is natural therefore to wonder whether QC could also be applied to boost their performance. The goal of this tutorial is to show how QC works to an audience that is not familiar with the technology, as well as how to apply the QC paradigm of Quantum Annealing (QA) to solve practical problems that are currently faced by IR and RS systems. During the tutorial, participants will be provided with the fundamentals required to understand QC and to apply it in practice by using a real D-Wave quantum annealer through APIs.

TI Control and readout of a superconducting qubit using a photonic link
SO NATURE
AB Delivering on the revolutionary promise of a universal quantum computer will require processors with millions of quantum bits (qubits)(1-3). In superconducting quantum processors(4), each qubit is individually addressed with microwave signal lines that connect room-temperature electronics to the cryogenic environment of the quantum circuit. The complexity and heat load associated with the multiple coaxial lines per qubit limits the maximum possible size of a processor to a few thousand qubits(5). Here we introduce a photonic link using an optical fibre to guide modulated laser light from room temperature to a cryogenic photodetector(6), capable of delivering shot-noise-limited microwave signals directly at millikelvin temperatures. By demonstrating high-fidelity control and readout of a superconducting qubit, we show that this photonic link can meet the stringent requirements of superconducting quantum information processing(7). Leveraging the low thermal conductivity and large intrinsic bandwidth of optical fibre enables the efficient and massively multiplexed delivery of coherent microwave control pulses, providing a path towards a million-qubit universal quantum computer.

Among other issues, there are hard limits to the number of qubits that can be integrated into a single chip. Multicore architectures are a firm candidate for unlocking the scalability of quantum processors. Nonetheless, the vulnerability and complexity of quantum communications make this a challenging approach. A comprehensive design should imply consolidating the communications stack in the quantum computer architecture. In this article, we explain how this vision, by entangling communications and computation in the core of the design, may help to solve the open challenges. We also summarize the first results of our application of structured design methodologies backing this vision. With our work, we hope to contribute with design guidelines that may help unleash the potential of quantum computing.

TI High-threshold fault-tolerant quantum computation with the
   Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill qubit under noise in an optical setup
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB To implement fault-tolerant quantum computation (FTQC) with continuous variables, continuous variables need to be digitized using an appropriate code such as the Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill (GKP) qubit. The scheme introduced in [Fukui et al. Phys. Rev. X 8, 021054 (2018)] has reduced the threshold of the squeezing level required for continuous-variable FTQC to less than 10 dB, assuming noise derived from the GKP qubit itself. In this paper, we propose a scheme to improve noise tolerance during the construction of a large-scale cluster state used for FTQC with the GKP qubits. In our scheme, a small-scale cluster state is prepared by employing maximum-likelihood estimation, the entanglement generation via the Bell measurement, and probabilistic reliable measurement. Then, a large-scale cluster state is constructed from the small-scale cluster states via the reliable encoded Bell measurement. In the numerical calculations, we assume errors derived from the two-mode gate and loss in the homodyne measurement in addition to noise from the GKP qubit itself. The results show that the thresholds of a squeezing level are around 8.1, 9.6, and 12.4 dB for loss in the homodyne measurement 0, 5, and 10%, respectively. Hence, this paper provides a way toward continuous-variable FTQC with a feasible squeezing level.

TI Post-quantum cryptography-driven security framework for cloud computing
SO OPEN COMPUTER SCIENCE
AB Data security in the cloud has been a major issue since the inception and adoption of cloud computing. Various frameworks have been proposed, and yet data breach prevails. With encryption being the dominant method of cloud data security, the advent of quantum computing implies an urgent need to proffer a model that will provide adequate data security for both classical and quantum computing. Thus, most cryptosystems will be rendered susceptible and obsolete, though some cryptosystems will stand the test of quantum computing. The article proposes a model that comprises the application of a variant of McEliece cryptosystem, which has been tipped to replace Rivest-Shamir-Adleman (RSA) in the quantum computing era to secure access control data and the application of a variant of N-th degree truncated polynomial ring units (NTRU) cryptosystem to secure cloud user data. The simulation of the proposed McEliece algorithm showed that the algorithm has a better time complexity than the existing McEliece cryptosystem. Furthermore, the novel tweaking of parameters S and P further improves the security of the proposed algorithms. More so, the simulation of the proposed NTRU algorithm revealed that the existing NTRU cryptosystem had a superior time complexity when juxtaposed with the proposed NTRU cryptosystem.

TI Spectral compression and entanglement reduction in the cascaded biphoton
   state with cavities
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICS B-ATOMIC MOLECULAR AND OPTICAL PHYSICS
AB The cascaded biphoton state generated from a cold atomic ensemble presents one of the strongly correlated resources that can preserve and relay quantum information. Under the four-wave mixing condition, the emitted signal and idler photons from the upper and lower excited states become highly correlated in their traveling directions and entangled in continuous frequency spaces. In this system, we theoretically study the spectral compression of the biphoton source using an external cavity and show the reduction in its frequency entanglement entropy. This indicates, respectively, an improved light absorption efficiency for the idler photon as well as an almost pure biphoton source which is useful in optical quantum networks. We further investigate the limit of the spectral compression that can be achieved by using multiple cavities. Our results show the capability and potential of the biphoton source with external cavities, where the performance of atom-based quantum memory can be enhanced and the entanglement property can be manipulated by tailoring the spectral compression.

TI Revolutionizing Healthcare: The Emerging Role of Quantum Computing in
   Enhancing Medical Technology and Treatment
SO CUREUS JOURNAL OF MEDICAL SCIENCE
AB The healthcare sector faces complex challenges that call for innovative solutions to improve diagnostic accuracy, treatment efficacy, and data management. Quantum computing, with its unique capabilities, holds the potential to revolutionize various aspects of healthcare. This narrative review critically examines the existing literature on the application of quantum computing in healthcare, focusing on its utility in enhancing diagnostics, data processing, and treatment planning. Quantum computing's ability to handle large, complex datasets more efficiently than classical computers can significantly impact domains such as genomics, medical imaging, and personalized medicine. Quantum algorithms can accelerate the identification of genetic markers associated with diseases, facilitate the analysis of medical images, and optimize treatment plans based on individual genetic profiles. Moreover, quantum cryptography offers a robust security solution for safeguarding sensitive patient data, a critical need as healthcare increasingly relies on digital platforms. Despite the promising outlook, the integration of quantum computing into healthcare faces technical, ethical, and regulatory challenges. The delicate nature of quantum hardware, the need for error correction, and the scalability of quantum systems pose barriers to widespread adoption. Additionally, concerns around patient privacy and data security, as well as the need for updated regulatory frameworks, must be addressed. Ongoing research and collaborative efforts involving researchers, healthcare providers, and technology developers are crucial to overcoming these hurdles and realizing the full potential of quantum computing in transforming healthcare. As quantum computing continues to evolve, its impact on the future of healthcare could be profound, leading to earlier disease detection, more personalized treatments, and improved patient outcomes. For instance, quantum computing has already been applied to enhance drug discovery processes, with companies like D-Wave Systems (Burnaby, Canada) demonstrating faster molecular simulations for pharmaceutical research and IBM's (Armonk, USA) quantum systems being used to model chemical reactions for new drug development.

TI Predicting Brain Age and Gender from Brain Volume Data Using Variational
   Quantum Circuits
SO BRAIN SCIENCES
AB The morphology of the brain undergoes changes throughout the aging process, and accurately predicting a person's brain age and gender using brain morphology features can aid in detecting atypical brain patterns. Neuroimaging-based estimation of brain age is commonly used to assess an individual's brain health relative to a typical aging trajectory, while accurately classifying gender from neuroimaging data offers valuable insights into the inherent neurological differences between males and females. In this study, we aimed to compare the efficacy of classical machine learning models with that of a quantum machine learning method called a variational quantum circuit in estimating brain age and predicting gender based on structural magnetic resonance imaging data. We evaluated six classical machine learning models alongside a quantum machine learning model using both combined and sub-datasets, which included data from both in-house collections and public sources. The total number of participants was 1157, ranging from ages 14 to 89, with a gender distribution of 607 males and 550 females. Performance evaluation was conducted within each dataset using training and testing sets. The variational quantum circuit model generally demonstrated superior performance in estimating brain age and gender classification compared to classical machine learning algorithms when using the combined dataset. Additionally, in benchmark sub-datasets, our approach exhibited better performance compared to previous studies that utilized the same dataset for brain age prediction. Thus, our results suggest that variational quantum algorithms demonstrate comparable effectiveness to classical machine learning algorithms for both brain age and gender prediction, potentially offering reduced error and improved accuracy.

TI Beating the Ramsey limit on sensing with deterministic qubit control
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Qubit frequency shifts, which often contain information about a target environment variable, are detected with Ramsey interference measurements. Unfortunately, the sensitivity of this protocol is limited by decoherence. We introduce a new protocol to enhance the sensitivity of a qubit frequency measurement in the presence of decoherence by applying a continuous drive to stabilize one component of the Bloch vector. We demonstrate our protocol on a superconducting qubit, enhancing sensitivity per measurement shot by 1.65 x and sensitivity per qubit evolution time by 1.09 x compared to Ramsey. We also explore the protocol theoretically, finding unconditional enhancements compared to Ramsey interferometry and maximum enhancements of 1.96 x and 1.18 x , respectively. Additionally, our protocol is robust to parameter miscalibrations. It requires no feedback and no extra control or measurement resources, and can be immediately applied in a wide variety of quantum computing and quantum sensor technologies.

TI Migrating Software Systems Toward Post-Quantum Cryptography-A Systematic
   Literature Review
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB Networks such as the Internet are essential for our connected world. Quantum computing threatens its fundamental security mechanisms. Therefore, a migration to post-quantum-cryptography (PQC) is necessary for networks and their components. Currently, there is little knowledge on how such migrations should be structured and implemented in practice. Our systematic literature review addresses migration approaches for IP networks towards PQC. It surveys papers about the migration process and exemplary real-world software system migrations. On the process side, we found that terminology, migration steps, and roles are not defined precisely or consistently across the literature. Still, we identified four major phases and appropriate substeps which we matched with also emerging archetypes of roles. In terms of real-world migrations, we see that reports used several different PQC implementations and hybrid solutions for migrations of systems belonging to a wide range of system types. Across all papers we noticed three major challenges for adopters: missing experience of PQC and a high realization effort, concerns about the security of the upcoming system, and finally, high complexity. Our findings indicate that recent standardization efforts already push quantum-safe networking forward. However, the literature is still not in consensus about definitions and best practices. Implementations are mostly experimental and not necessarily practical, leading to an overall chaotic situation. To better grasp this fast moving field of (applied) research, our systematic literature review provides a comprehensive overview of its current state and serves as a starting point for delving into the matter of PQC migration.

TI Representation learning with parameterised quantum circuits for
   advancing speech emotion recognition
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB Quantum machine learning (QML) offers a promising avenue for advancing representation learning in complex signal domains. In this study, we investigate the use of parameterised quantum circuits (PQCs) for speech emotion recognition (SER)-a challenging task due to the subtle temporal variations and overlapping affective states in vocal signals. We propose a hybrid quantum-classical architecture that integrates PQCs into a conventional convolutional neural network (CNN), leveraging quantum properties such as superposition and entanglement to enrich emotional feature representations. Experimental evaluations on three benchmark datasets IEMOCAP, RECOLA, and MSP-IMPROV-demonstrate that our hybrid model achieves improved classification performance relative to a purely classical CNN baseline, with over 50% reduction in trainable parameters. Furthermore, Adjusted Rand Index (ARI) analysis demonstrates that the quantum model yields feature representations with improved alignment to true emotion classes compared with the classical model, reinforcing the observed performance gains. This work provides early evidence of the potential for QML to enhance emotion recognition and lays the foundation for future quantum-enabled affective computing systems.

TI Geometry-information duality: Quantum entanglement contributions to
   gravitational dynamics
SO ANNALS OF PHYSICS
AB We propose a fundamental duality between the geometric properties of spacetime and the informational content of quantum fields, specifically through the entanglement entropy of quantum states. By establishing a correspondence between geometric invariants and informational measures, we introduce an informational stress-energy tensor Tinfo mu gamma, derived from quantum entanglement entropy, into Einstein's field equations. This framework modifies spacetime geometry, particularly in regimes of strong gravitational fields, such as near black holes. Our approach provides explicit corrections to Newton's constant G, incorporating entanglement entropy contributions from various quantum fields with explicit dependence on fundamental constants h, c, and kB, ensuring dimensional consistency. These corrections have implications for black hole thermodynamics, leading to entropy and temperature modifications, and extend to cosmology, influencing inflationary dynamics, Big Bang nucleosynthesis, and the nature of dark energy. Our findings suggest that quantum information fundamentally shapes spacetime structure, offering testable predictions in gravitational and cosmological phenomena and shedding new light on challenges in quantum gravity.

TI Triangulated relativistic quantum computation: a curvature-modulated
   unification of quantum and relativistic computing
SO QUANTUM STUDIES-MATHEMATICS AND FOUNDATIONS
AB We introduce Triangulated Relativistic Quantum Computation (TRQC), a mathematically consistent framework that integrates relativistic causal constraints with quantum channel dynamics by promoting intrinsic curvature to a first-class control parameter. Spacetime is modeled as an oriented simplicial complex endowed with a time labeling that induces a causal partial order on events. Quantum degrees of freedom are finite-dimensional and attached to vertices, while local evolution along edges is given by completely positive trace-preserving (CPTP) maps generated by a curvature-modulated Lindbladian. Curvature on spacelike slices is estimated from vertex angle deficits of a latent triangulation-intrinsic to the induced piecewise-Euclidean metric of the chosen embedding; this estimator is O(d)-invariant under global orthogonal transformations of the latent embedding, with an explicit per-slice scale convention. We prove: (i) gauge invariance of the angle-deficit and curvature density; (ii) well-posedness and norm-continuity of curvature-modulated CPTP semigroups; (iii) causal factorization and no-signaling across spacelike-separated subcomputations via order-independence within slices; (iv) triangulation invariance under commuting-locality with preserved per-cell generators, and triangulation-independence in a Lie-Trotter refinement limit; (v) a discrete Gauss-Bonnet identity on closed slices; and (vi) quantum speed limits and Lindbladian perturbation bounds with explicit curvature dependence. In the flat limit, TRQC reduces to standard quantum circuits; in an entanglement-breaking limit, it reduces to classical relativistic computation. We outline algorithms for curvature evaluation on moving meshes, causal scheduling, and remeshing-robust Trotterization, and we sketch applications to relativistic quantum networking, analog simulation on curved/hyperbolic lattices, geometry-aware error correction, and transport on curved or fractal nanostructures. Beyond offering new theoretical guarantees, TRQC provides a practical semantics for designing and simulating quantum information processing in nontrivial geometries and time-dilated settings.

TI Practical Security of RSA Against NTC-Architecture Quantum Computing
   Attacks
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF THEORETICAL PHYSICS
AB Quantum algorithms can greatly speed up computation in solving some classical problems, while the computational power of quantum computers should also be restricted by laws of physics. Due to quantum time-energy uncertainty relation, there is a lower limit of the evolution time for a given quantum operation, and therefore the time complexity must be considered when the number of serial quantum operations is particularly large. When the key length is about at the level of KB (encryption and decryption can be completed in a few minutes by using standard programs), it will take at least 50-100 years for NTC (Neighbor-only, Two-qubit gate, Concurrent) architecture ion-trap quantum computers to execute Shor's algorithm. For NTC architecture superconducting quantum computers with a code distance 27 for error-correcting, when the key length increased to 16 KB, the cracking time will also increase to 100 years that far exceeds the coherence time. This shows the robustness of the updated RSA against practical quantum computing attacks.

SO CHEMICAL SOCIETY REVIEWS
AB The emerging field of quantum life science combines principles from quantum physics and biology to study fundamental life processes at the molecular level. Quantum mechanics, which describes the properties of small particles, can help explain how quantum phenomena such as tunnelling, superposition, and entanglement may play a role in biological systems. However, capturing these effects in living systems is a formidable challenge, as it involves dealing with dissipation and decoherence caused by the surrounding environment. We overview the current status of the quantum life sciences from technologies and topics in quantum biology. Technologies such as biological nano quantum sensors, quantum technology-based hyperpolarized MRI/NMR, high-speed 2D electronic spectrometers, and computer simulations are being developed to address these challenges. These interdisciplinary fields have the potential to revolutionize our understanding of living organisms and lead to advancements in genetics, molecular biology, medicine, and bioengineering.

AB We first present the evaluation of a professional development course for in-service teachers on quantum technologies which was initially presented at the GIREP Malta 2020 webinar about halfway into its development. The primary purpose of the course was to enhance physics teachers' knowledge and awareness of topics related to quantum computation and quantum information, and of their relevance for technological advancement. However, our choice was not to present such topics as a simple addition to high school physics in the final year, but rather to inspect the whole physics and mathematics curriculum in the search for a longitudinal perspective, roughly based on the relationship between physics and computation, which could culminate in the treatment of quantum information topics. In the present contribution, we will focus on the educational outcomes of the course in terms of teacher appreciation, interest level and judgement of usefulness coming from both a final questionnaire and individual interviews. We will also describe a follow-up course structured to frame the topic from the standpoint of curriculum design and action research projects currently underway.

TI Randomized Ancillary Qubit Overcomes Detector-Control and
   Intercept-Resend Hacking of Quantum Key Distribution
SO JOURNAL OF LIGHTWAVE TECHNOLOGY
AB Practical implementations of quantum key distribution (QKD) have been shown to be subject to various detector side-channel attacks that compromise the promised unconditional security. Most notable is a general class of attacks adopting the use of faked-state photons as in the detector-control and, more broadly, the intercept-resend attacks. In this paper, we present a simple scheme to overcome such class of attacks: A legitimate user, Bob, uses a polarization randomizer at his gateway to distort an ancillary polarization of a phase-encoded photon in a bidirectional QKD configuration. Passing through the randomizer once on the way to his partner, Alice, and again in the opposite direction, the polarization qubit of the genuine photon is immune to randomization. However, the polarization state of a photon from an intruder, Eve, to Bob is randomized and hence directed to a detector in a different path, whereupon it triggers an alert. We demonstrate theoretically and experimentally that, using commercial off-the-shelf detectors, it can be made impossible for Eve to avoid triggering the alert, no matter what faked-state of light she uses.

TI Optimizing Quantum Teleportation and Dense Coding via Mixed Noise Under
   Non-Markovian Approximation
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF THEORETICAL PHYSICS
AB Physicists are attracted to open-system dynamics, how quantum systems evolve, and how they can be protected from unnecessary environmental noise, especially when environmental memory effects are non-negligible, as with non-Markovian approximations. There are several methods to solve the master equation of non-Markovian cases and we obtain the solutions of the quantum-state-diffusion equation for a two-qubit system using the perturbation method under the influence of various types of environmental noise, including relaxation noise, dephasing noise and their mixture. It was found that by inducing dephasing noise into the relaxation process strengthens the correlation between qubits by restoring the entanglement lost in the environment, thereby making it possible to optimize quantum teleportation fidelity and dense coding capacity via mixed noise under non-Markovian approximation.

TI Electrodynamics-based quantum gate optimization with born scattering
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB In this paper, we propose employing electron scattering to realize unitary quantum gates that are controlled by three qubits. Using Feynman's rules, we find an expression for the transition amplitude for scattering from an external electromagnetic source. In this context, the scattering amplitude is modeled as a unitary gate whose state can be regulated. The optimal value of the vector potential needed to implement the gate is obtained by minimizing the difference between the designed gate and the target gate, with the total energy consumed as a constraint. The design algorithm is obtained by discretizing the resulting integral equations into vector equations. This design algorithm can be applied in various fields such as quantum computing, communication, and sensing. It offers a promising approach for developing efficient and accurate gates for quantum information processing. Furthermore, this approach can also be extended to design gates for multi-qubit systems, which are essential for large-scale quantum computing. The use of this algorithm can significantly contribute to the development of practical quantum technologies.

TI Emergence of maximal hidden quantum correlations and its trade-off with
   the filtering probability in dissipative two-qubit systems
SO PHYSICA A-STATISTICAL MECHANICS AND ITS APPLICATIONS
AB We investigate the behaviour of quantum CHSH-nonlocality, F3-steering, and usefulness for teleportation in an interacting two-qubit dissipative system. We show regimes where these three quantum correlations can be extracted by means of local filtering operations, despite them not being displayed in the bare natural time evolution. Moreover, we show the existence of local hidden state (LHS) and local hidden variable (LHV) models for some states during the dynamics and thus, showing that apparently-useless physical systems could still exhibit quantum correlations, which are hidden from us, but that can still be revealed by means of local filtering operations and therefore, displaying the phenomenon of hidden quantum correlations. Furthermore, we report on extreme versions of these phenomena, where the revealed correlations achieve the maximal amount allowed by quantum theory. This phenomenon of maximal hidden correlations relies on the qubits collective damping, and may take place even in long-distance separated qubits. Despite the immediate appeal of the physical system displaying such an extreme phenomenon, we furthermore show however, that there actually exists a trade-off between the amount of quantum correlations which can be extracted and the filtering probability with which such protocol can be implemented. Explicitly, the higher the amount of correlations to be extracted, the more difficult it becomes for the protocol to be implemented (lower filtering probability). This is consequently showing us the remarkable fact that whilst the phenomenon of maximal hidden quantum correlations does naturally emerge during the evolution of physical systems, Nature does not completely give it away for free, by imposing a limit to the rate at which this can be done. From a theoretical point of view, the existence of such trade-off imposes a fundamental limit to the extraction of quantum correlations by local filtering operations. From a practical point of view on the other hand, the results here presented determine the amount of resources that should be invested in order to extract such maximal hidden quantum correlations.(c) 2022 Elsevier B.V.

TI Lie-algebraic classical simulations for quantum computing
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB The classical simulation of quantum dynamics plays an important role in our understanding of quantum complexity and in the development of quantum technologies. Efficient techniques such as those based on the Gottesman-Knill theorem for Clifford circuits, tensor networks for low entanglement-generating circuits, or Wick's theorem for fermionic Gaussian states have become central tools in quantum computing. In this work, we contribute to this body of knowledge by presenting a framework for classical simulations, dubbed "g-sim", which is based on the underlying Lie algebraic structure of the dynamical process. When the dimension of the algebra grows at most polynomially in the system size, there exist observables for which the simulation is efficient. Indeed, we show that g-sim enables new regimes for classical simulations, is able to deal with certain forms of noise in the evolution, as well as can be used to tackle several paradigmatic variational and nonvariational quantum computing tasks. For the former, we perform Lie-algebraic simulations to train and optimize parametrized quantum circuits (thus effectively showing that some variational models can be dequantized), design enhanced parameter initialization strategies, solve tasks of quantum circuit synthesis, and train a quantum-phase classifier. For the latter, we report large-scale noiseless and noisy simulations on benchmark problems. By comparing the limitations of g-sim and certain Wick's theorem-based simulations, we find that the two methods become inefficient for different types of states or observables, hinting at the existence of distinct, nonequivalent resources for classical simulation.

TI Random Quantum Circuits Transform Local Noise into Global White Noise
SO COMMUNICATIONS IN MATHEMATICAL PHYSICS
AB We study the distribution over measurement outcomes of noisy random quantum circuits in the regime of low fidelity, which corresponds to the setting where the computation experiences at least one gate-level error with probability close to one. We model noise by adding a pair of weak, unital, single-qubit noise channels after each two-qubit gate, and we show that for typical random circuit instances, correlations between the noisy output distribution P-noisy and the corresponding noiseless output distribution P-ideal shrink exponentially with the expected number of gate-level errors. Specifically, the linear cross-entropy benchmark F that measures this correlation behaves as F = exp(-2s epsilon +/- O(s epsilon(2))), where epsilon is the probability of error per circuit location and s is the number of two-qubit gates. Furthermore, if the noise is incoherent-for example, depolarizing or dephasing noise-the total variation distance between the noisy output distribution P-noisy and the uniform distribution P-unif decays at precisely the same rate. Consequently, the noisy output distribution can be approximated as P-noisy approximate to FPideal +(1 - F)P-unif. In other words, although at least one local error occurs with probability 1 - F, the errors are scrambled by the random quantum circuit and can be treated as global white noise, contributing completely uniform output. Importantly, we upper bound the average total variation error in this approximation by O(F epsilon root s). Thus, the "white-noise approximation" is meaningful when epsilon root s << 1, a quadratically weaker condition than the epsilon s << 1 requirement to maintain high fidelity. The bound applies if the circuit size satisfies s >= Omega(n log (n)), which corresponds to only logarithmic depth circuits, and if, additionally, the inverse error rate satisfies epsilon-1 >= (Omega) over bar (n), which is needed to ensure errors are scrambled faster than F decays. The white-noise approximation is useful for salvaging the signal from a noisy quantum computation; for example, it was an underlying assumption in complexity-theoretic arguments that noisy random quantum circuits cannot be efficiently sampled classically, even when the fidelity is low. Our method is based on a map from second-moment quantities in random quantum circuits to expectation values of certain stochastic processes for which we compute upper and lower bounds.

Different from earlier considerations, we study the case where the gravitational field cannot be separated unitarily from the bipartite system in the final stage of the interaction. When the different gravitational field states are orthogonal, entanglement cannot be generated for an initial product state. If the different gravitational field states are non-orthogonal, entanglement can be generated and the amount of generated entanglement depends on an overlap parameter between different gravitational field states. The influence of gravitational field on the transfer of the state through quantum teleportation is also studied, which might lead to an observable effect since the quantum teleportation can be performed using macroscopic object.

TI Beyond photon pairs-nonlinear quantum photonics in the high-gain regime:
   a tutorial
SO ADVANCES IN OPTICS AND PHOTONICS
AB Integrated optical devices will play a central role in the future development of nonlinear quantum photonics. Here we consider the generation of nonclassical states of light within them with a focus on Gaussian states beyond the low-gain, single photon pair regime accurately described by perturbation theory. Starting from the solid foundation provided by Maxwell's equations, we then move to applications by presenting a unified formulation that allows for a comparison of stimulated and spontaneous experiments in ring resonators and nanophotonic waveguides and leads directly to the calculation of the quantum states of light generated in high-gain nonlinear quantum photonic experiments.(c) 2022 Optica Publishing Group

TI Statistical Correlation Between Quantum Entanglement and Spin-Orbit
   Coupling in Crossed Beam Molecular Dynamics
SO ADVANCED QUANTUM TECHNOLOGIES
AB Non-classical features like interference are already being harnessed to control the output of chemical reactions. However, quantum entanglement which is an equally enigmatic many-body quantum correlation can also be used as a powerful resource yet has eluded explicit attention. In this report, an experimental scheme under the crossed beam molecular dynamical setup, with the F + HD reaction, is proposed aiming to study the possible influence of entanglement within reactant pairs on the angular features of the product distribution. The aforesaid reaction has garnered interest recently, as an unusual horseshoe shape pattern in the product (HF) distribution was observed, which has been attributed to the coupling of spin and orbital degrees of freedom. An experimental scheme is proposed aiming to study the possible influence of entanglement on the necessity for the inclusion of such spin-orbit characteristics, under circumstances wherein the existence of entanglement and spin-orbit interaction is simultaneously detectable. The attainable results are further numerically simulated highlighting specific patterns corresponding to various possibilities. Such studies if extended can provide unforeseen mechanistic insight into analogous reactions, too, from the lens of quantum information.

TI Quantum annealing of a frustrated magnet
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Quantum annealing, which involves quantum tunnelling among possible solutions, has state-of-the-art applications not only in quickly finding the lowest-energy configuration of a complex system, but also in quantum computing. Here we report a single-crystal study of the frustrated magnet alpha-CoV2O6, consisting of a triangular arrangement of ferromagnetic Ising spin chains without evident structural disorder. We observe quantum annealing phenomena resulting from time-reversal symmetry breaking in a tiny transverse field. Below similar to 1 K, the system exhibits no indication of approaching the lowest-energy state for at least 15 hours in zero transverse field, but quickly converges towards that configuration with a nearly temperature-independent relaxation time of similar to 10 seconds in a transverse field of similar to 3.5 mK. Our many-body simulations show qualitative agreement with the experimental results, and suggest that a tiny transverse field can profoundly enhance quantum spin fluctuations, triggering rapid quantum annealing process from topological metastable Kosterlitz-Thouless phases, at low temperatures.

TI Four-Photon Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger Entanglement via Collective
   Two-Photon Coherence in Doppler-Broadened Atoms
SO ADVANCED QUANTUM TECHNOLOGIES
AB Bright, entangled multiphoton sources based on atom-photon interactions are an essential requirement in the realization of several quantum information and quantum computation schemes based on photonic quantum systems. Here, a four-photon polarization-entangled Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) state obtained from Doppler-broadened atomic ensembles of Rb-87 atoms is experimentally demonstrated. Owing to collective two-photon coherence in the Doppler-broadened cascade-type atomic system, the setup enables the generation of robust four-photon GHZ states with a fidelity of 82.1% and a measured four-photon average coincidence rate of 0.58 s(-1). It is believed that the generation of such bright and stable multiphoton GHZ states from atomic media is an important step toward realizing photonic quantum computation and practical quantum networks based on atom-photon interactions.

TI Quantum computing for solving Bayesian networks of bridges - method and
   recommendations
SO COGENT ENGINEERING
AB The use of quantum computing as an efficient alternative to classical computing is rapidly evolving in diverse engineering applications to solve complex numerical problems. As its application becomes increasingly prominent in the future, its use should be complemented by validation and practical recommendations. This paper provides practical recommendations regarding the accuracy and efficiency of quantum computing for solving diverse types of Bayesian networks for bridge evaluation and maintenance, including basic and fuzzy-based networks. The methodology for solving the considered networks, development of quantum circuits, and accuracy of the results (quantum computing versus simulator and classical computing) were examined. Research findings indicate the feasibility of quantum computing for solving small-scale bridge Bayesian networks (error of 6% approximately), whereas the accuracy of solutions for solving complex networks using available open-access quantum computers is compromised owing to the limited number of available attempts and the compound effect of quantum error (error up to 37% approximately). Practical recommendations were provided to practitioners and future research needs are identified.

TI Effective routing design for remote entanglement generation on quantum
   networks
SO NPJ QUANTUM INFORMATION
AB Quantum network is a promising platform for many ground-breaking applications that lie beyond the capability of its classical counterparts. Efficient entanglement generation on quantum networks with relatively limited resources such as quantum memories is essential to fully realize the network's capabilities, the solution to which calls for delicate network design and is currently at the primitive stage. In this study we propose an effective routing scheme to enable automatic responses for multiple requests of entanglement generation between source-terminal stations on a quantum lattice network with finite edge capacities. Multiple connection paths are exploited for each connection request while entanglement fidelity is ensured for each path by performing entanglement purification. The routing scheme is highly modularized with a flexible nature, embedding quantum operations within the algorithmic workflow, whose performance is evaluated from multiple perspectives. In particular, three algorithms are proposed and compared for the scheduling of capacity allocation on the edges of quantum network. Embodying the ideas of proportional share and progressive filling that have been well-studied in classical routing problems, we design another scheduling algorithm, the propagatory update method, which in certain aspects overrides the two algorithms based on classical heuristics in scheduling performances. The general solution scheme paves the road for effective design of efficient routing and flow control protocols on applicational quantum networks.

TI Fault-Tolerant Quantum Computation with Constant Overhead for General
   Noise
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB Fault-tolerant quantum computation traditionally incurs substantial resource overhead, with both qubit and time overheads scaling polylogarithmically with the size of the computation. While prior work by Gottesman has shown that constant qubit overhead is achievable under stochastic noise using quantum low-density parity-check (QLDPC) codes, it has remained an open question whether similar guarantees hold under more general, nonstochastic noise models. In this work, we address this question by considering a general circuit-level noise model defined via the diamond norm, which captures both stochastic and nonstochastic noise, including coherent and amplitude damping noise. We prove that constant qubit overhead fault-tolerant quantum computation is achievable in this general setting, using QLDPC codes with constant rate and linear minimum distance. To establish our result, we develop a fault-tolerant error correction scheme and a method for implementing logic gates under general circuit noise. These results extend the theoretical foundations of fault-tolerant quantum computation and offer new directions for fault-tolerant architectures under realistic noise models.

TI A practitioner's guide to quantum algorithms for optimisation problems
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICS A-MATHEMATICAL AND THEORETICAL
AB Quantum computing is gaining popularity across a wide range of scientific disciplines due to its potential to solve long-standing computational problems that are considered intractable with classical computers. One promising area where quantum computing has potential is in the speed-up of NP-hard optimisation problems that are common in industrial areas such as logistics and finance. Newcomers to the field of quantum computing who are interested in using this technology to solve optimisation problems do not have an easily accessible source of information on the current capabilities of quantum computers and algorithms. This paper aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the theory of quantum optimisation techniques and their practical application, focusing on their near-term potential for noisy intermediate scale quantum devices. The paper starts by drawing parallels between classical and quantum optimisation problems, highlighting their conceptual similarities and differences. Two main paradigms for quantum hardware are then discussed: analogue and gate-based quantum computers. While analog devices such as quantum annealers are effective for some optimisation problems, they have limitations and cannot be used for universal quantum computation. In contrast, gate-based quantum computers offer the potential for universal quantum computation, but they face challenges with hardware limitations and accurate gate implementation. The paper provides a detailed mathematical discussion with references to key works in the field, as well as a more practical discussion with relevant examples. The most popular techniques for quantum optimisation on gate-based quantum computers, the quantum approximate optimisation algorithm and the quantum alternating operator ansatz framework, are discussed in detail. However, it is still unclear whether these techniques will yield quantum advantage, even with advancements in hardware and noise reduction. The paper concludes with a discussion of the challenges facing quantum optimisation techniques and the need for further research and development to identify new, effective methods for achieving quantum advantage.

TI Can a qudit carry more information than a dit?
SO CONTEMPORARY PHYSICS
AB Conventional wisdom suggests that within a fixed preparation-measurement setup, a qubit system offers no advantage over a bit. This indeed holds true when considering the standard communication and the famous Holevo bound then formalises the statement that one qubit can encode at most one bit of information. However, there exist subtle differences between these two physical systems that, when properly exploited, can be converted into practical applications. We begin by discussing the similarities between qudits and dits as information carriers. Then we recall a general framework for communication tasks and review some differences that qudits and dits have. In the end, we present a simple communication application that utilises the quantum character of the qubit.

TI Integrating code-based post-quantum cryptography into SSL TLS protocols
   through an interoperable hybrid framework
SO DISCOVER COMPUTING
AB The advancement of quantum computing creates a big threat to classical cryptographic protocols, including TLS, which is responsible for secure internet communications. While recent industry and academic efforts have focused on integrating lattice-based post-quantum key encapsulation mechanisms (KEMs) such as Kyber+X25519 into hybrid TLS handshakes, these approaches often prioritize performance at the cost of cryptanalytic diversity. Code-based KEMs, despite their proven security measure they remain underexplored in hybrid frameworks due to some limitations like large key sizes and integration complexity. This paper proposes a novel hybrid TLS framework that explicitly incorporates code-based post-quantum cryptography-specifically McEliece-alongside classical key exchange mechanisms. The framework introduces a dual-handshake mechanism, adaptive parameter selection, and seamless fallback negotiation, enabling flexible deployment across heterogeneous networks while ensuring backward compatibility. Integration with Quantum Random Number Generators (QRNGs) and multifactor authentication further increases entropy quality and session security. We implemented and evaluated the framework using an OpenSSL-OQS integration. We measure handshake latency, CPU utilization, memory usage, and throughput across emulated and real-world testbeds. Results show that the proposed hybrid approach achieves up to 30% lower latency and significantly reduced resource overhead compared to pure post-quantum TLS variants, while maintaining near-classical efficiency levels. Mathematical modeling formalizes these trade-offs which offers a foundation for optimizing deployment in both resource-constrained IoT devices and high-performance servers. By advancing cryptographic diversity and aligning with emerging NIST and IETF standardization efforts, the proposed framework provides a practical pathway toward quantum-resilient secure communication.It shows that code-based post-quantum cryptography can be added to current TLS systems without any problems, keeping security, performance, and compatibility in mind as we get ready for the quantum age.

TI Entanglement-based quantum key distribution with non-Gaussian continuous
   variables
SO PROCEEDINGS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY A-MATHEMATICAL PHYSICAL AND ENGINEERING
   SCIENCES
AB Addition of single photons to two-mode-squeezed-vacuum states has the effect of distilling quantum entanglement and, when deployed in quantum key distribution, should lead also to an increase in the secret key rate. However, the extraction of secret keys from non-Gaussian entangled states is a complex issue and is at present not fully understood. In this paper, we describe a technique for adding photons to entangled states and demonstrate how it leads to an increase in secret key rates and the maximal distance for which keys can be distributed assuming asymptotic conditions. The quantum correlations thus produced were found to be of a highly non-Gaussian character, such that the Gaussian extremity principle returns a negative keyrate and effectively kills the protocol; we have, therefore, developed methods of analysis that do not require prior assumptions about the state. Although it could have been that the addition of single photons would make the system more fragile, this turned out not to be the case. Rather, the addition of a single photon was found to protect the protocol against both passive and active decoherence.

TI Laziness, barren plateau, and noises in machine learning
SO MACHINE LEARNING-SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB We define laziness to describe a large suppression of variational parameter updates for neural networks, classical or quantum. In the quantum case, the suppression is exponential in the number of qubits for randomized variational quantum circuits. We discuss the difference between laziness and barren plateau in quantum machine learning created by quantum physicists in McClean et al (2018 Nat. Commun. 9 1-6) for the flatness of the loss function landscape during gradient descent. We address a novel theoretical understanding of those two phenomena in light of the theory of neural tangent kernels. For noiseless quantum circuits, without the measurement noise, the loss function landscape is complicated in the overparametrized regime with a large number of trainable variational angles. Instead, around a random starting point in optimization, there are large numbers of local minima that are good enough and could minimize the mean square loss function, where we still have quantum laziness, but we do not have barren plateaus. However, the complicated landscape is not visible within a limited number of iterations, and low precision in quantum control and quantum sensing. Moreover, we look at the effect of noises during optimization by assuming intuitive noise models, and show that variational quantum algorithms are noise-resilient in the overparametrization regime. Our work precisely reformulates the quantum barren plateau statement towards a precision statement and justifies the statement in certain noise models, injects new hope toward near-term variational quantum algorithms, and provides theoretical connections toward classical machine learning. Our paper provides conceptual perspectives about quantum barren plateaus, together with discussions about the gradient descent dynamics in Liu et al (2023 Phys. Rev. Lett. 130 150601).

Despite this potential, the field of quantum machine learning is still in its early stages, and there persists a level of skepticism regarding a possible near-term quantum advantage. This paper aims to provide a classical perspective on current quantum algorithms for supervised learning, effectively bridging traditional machine learning principles with advancements in quantum machine learning. Specifically, this study charts a research trajectory that diverges from the predominant focus of quantum machine learning literature, originating from the prerequisites of classical methodologies and elucidating the potential impact of quantum approaches. Through this exploration, our objective is to deepen the understanding of the convergence between classical and quantum methods, thereby laying the groundwork for future advancements in both domains and fostering the involvement of classical practitioners in the field of quantum machine learning.

TI A quantum feature selection framework via ground state preparation
SO PHYSICA SCRIPTA
AB Traditional feature selection methods face the challenges of increasing time complexity and local optima. In previous works, many classical feature selection methods were accelerated through quantum algorithms. However, these approaches still inherit the constraints of these classical methods as they do not address the issue of local minima. Here, we propose a novel quantum feature selection framework based on the classifier's result, which utilizes Hamiltonian encoding and a ground state preparation algorithm. Numerical experiments are conducted on real-world datasets from the finance and medicine domains. Moreover, the results demonstrate that the proposed method produces the same or better classification accuracy on the classifier than the original data without feature selection. Overall, our approach presents a promising solution to feature selection using quantum computing.

TI Crosstalk Suppression in Individually Addressed Two-Qubit Gates in a

SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB Crosstalk between target and neighboring spectator qubits due to spillover of control signals represents a major error source limiting the fidelity of two-qubit entangling gates in quantum computers. We show that in our laser-driven trapped-ion system coherent crosstalk error can be modeled as residual X sigma phi interaction and can be actively canceled by single-qubit echoing pulses. We propose and demonstrate a crosstalk suppression scheme that eliminates all first-order crosstalk utilizing only local control of target qubits, as opposed to an existing scheme which requires control over all neighboring qubits. We report a two-qubit Bell state fidelity of 99.52(6)% with the echoing pulses applied after collective gates and 99.37(5)% with the echoing pulses applied to each gate in a five-ion chain. This scheme is widely applicable to other platforms with analogous interaction Hamiltonians.

AB In the recent years important experimental advances in resonant electro-optic modulators as high-efficiency sources for coherent frequency combs and as devices for quantum information transfer have been realized, where strong optical and microwave mode coupling were achieved. These features suggest electro-optic-based devices as candidates for entangled optical frequency comb sources. In the present work, I study the generation of entangled optical frequency combs in millimeter-sized resonant electro-optic modulators. These devices profit from the experimentally proven advantages such as nearly constant optical free spectral ranges over several gigahertz, and high optical and microwave quality factors. The generation of frequency multiplexed quantum channels with spectral bandwidth in the MHz range for conservative parameter values paves the way towards novel uses in long-distance hybrid quantum networks, quantum key distribution, enhanced optical metrology, and quantum computing.

AB Quantum computers have the potential to solve important problems which are fundamentally intractable on a classical computer. The underlying physics of quantum computing platforms supports using multi-valued logic, which promises a boost in performance over the prevailing two-level logic. One key element to exploiting this potential is the capability to efficiently prepare quantum states for multi-valued, or qudit, systems. Due to the time sensitivity of quantum computers, the circuits to prepare the required states have to be as short as possible. In this paper, we investigate quantum state preparation with a focus on mixed-dimensional systems, where the individual qudits may have different dimensionalities. The proposed approach automatically realizes quantum circuits constructing a corresponding mixed-dimensional quantum state. To this end, decision diagrams are used as a compact representation of the quantum state to be realized. We further incorporate the ability to approximate the quantum state to enable a finely controlled trade-off between accuracy, memory complexity, and number of operations in the circuit. Empirical evaluations demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach in facilitating fast and scalable quantum state preparation, with performance directly linked to the size of the decision diagram.

TI Effect of Quantum Noise on Deterministic Remote Preparation of an
   Arbitrary Two-Qubit State With a Relay Node
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB We propose a scheme for deterministic remote preparation of an arbitrary two-qubit state via a relay node. Afterwards, we investigate how the scheme is influenced by the noise type, the initial state to be remotely prepared, and the decoherence rate. We find that the fidelity is symmetrical with the line (lambda(b-f) = lambda(p-f) = 0.5) in bit-flip and phase-flip channels. In addition, the fidelity decreases with the increase of decoherence rate in the amplitude-damping and phase-damping channels. We also compare it with other RSP schemes. Since only Bell pairs work as the quantum channels, it makes our RSP scheme more available and feasible.

TI Transition role of entangled data in quantum machine learning
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Entanglement serves as the resource to empower quantum computing. Recent progress has highlighted its positive impact on learning quantum dynamics, wherein the integration of entanglement into quantum operations or measurements of quantum machine learning (QML) models leads to substantial reductions in training data size, surpassing a specified prediction error threshold. However, an analytical understanding of how the entanglement degree in data affects model performance remains elusive. In this study, we address this knowledge gap by establishing a quantum no-free-lunch (NFL) theorem for learning quantum dynamics using entangled data. Contrary to previous findings, we prove that the impact of entangled data on prediction error exhibits a dual effect, depending on the number of permitted measurements. With a sufficient number of measurements, increasing the entanglement of training data consistently reduces the prediction error or decreases the required size of the training data to achieve the same prediction error. Conversely, when few measurements are allowed, employing highly entangled data could lead to an increased prediction error. The achieved results provide critical guidance for designing advanced QML protocols, especially for those tailored for execution on early-stage quantum computers with limited access to quantum resources.
   Given that entangled states can store more information than unentangled ones, it would be natural to assume that highly-entangled data would always enhance capabilities of quantum machine learning models. Here, the authors show that this is not the case, in particular when the allowed number of measurements to incoherently learn quantum dynamics is low

TI Isoholonomic inequality and tight implementations of holonomic quantum
   gates
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB In holonomic quantum computation, quantum logic gates are realized by cyclic parallel transport of the computational space. The resulting quantum gate corresponds to the holonomy associated with the closed path traced by the computational space. The isoholonomic inequality for gates establishes a fundamental lower bound on the path length of such cyclic transports, which depends only on the spectrum of the holonomy, that is, the eigenvalues of the implemented quantum gate. The isoholonomic inequality also gives rise to an estimate of the minimum time required to execute a holonomic quantum gate, underscoring the central role of the inequality in quantum computation. In this paper, we show that when the codimension of the computational space is sufficiently large, any quantum gate can be implemented using a parallel transporting Hamiltonian in a way that saturates the isoholonomic inequality and the corresponding time estimate. We call such implementations tight. The treatment presented here is constructive and lays the foundation for the development of efficient and optimal implementation strategies in holonomic quantum computation.

TI Practical Assessment of the SSH Services' Transition to Post-Quantum
   Cryptography
SO BALTIC JOURNAL OF MODERN COMPUTING
AB Quantum computing poses a critical threat to classical public-key cryptography, driving the adoption of post-quantum cryptography (PQC). While PQC performance has been extensively benchmarked in TLS, empirical studies on the Secure Shell (SSH) protocol remain limited. This paper evaluates the integration of PQC and hybrid (classical+PQC) mechanisms into SSH using an OQS-OpenSSH 8.9 prototype with liboqs support. We measured handshake latency, session size, and Secure Copy Protocol (SCP) transfer performance across standardized algorithms (CRYSTALS-Kyber, CRYSTALS Dilithium, Sphincs+), Falcon, and hybrid configurations. Experiments on heterogeneous legacy hardware under realistic LAN conditions were validated through Wireshark captures and protocol checklists. The results show that Falcon yields the smallest handshake sizes, Dilithium offers balanced and stable performance, Kyber scales predictably with NIST security levels, and Sphincs+ incurs significant overhead. Hybrid modes add limited cost while retaining classical trust anchors. These findings extend SSH PQC research beyond handshake analysis, offering deployment-oriented guidance for quantum-safe migration.

TI Factory layout planning using quantum annealing
SO CIRP ANNALS-MANUFACTURING TECHNOLOGY
AB Factory layout planning is a central task in manufacturing system design, affecting transportation routes, throughput times, and resource utilization. While manual methods and traditional approximative approaches often fall short of industrial demands due to time and quality constraints, quantum annealing presents a promising alternative. This paper introduces a constrained quadratic model for automated factory layout planning, incorporating multi-criteria objectives and scalability. Utilizing data from an industrial scenario, the approach is benchmarked against non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm II for greenfield and brownfield planning. The results demonstrate quantum annealing's superior performance in solution quality through reductions in transport intensity and space optimization. (c) 2025 The Author(s).

TI Two-Way Covert Quantum Communication in the Microwave Regime
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB Quantum communication addresses the problem of exchanging information across macroscopic distances by employing encryption techniques based on quantum-mechanical laws. Here, we advance a new paradigm for secure quantum communication by combining backscattering concepts with covert communication in the microwave regime. Our protocol allows communication between Alice, who uses only discrete phase modulations, and Bob, who has access to cryogenic microwave technology. Using notions of quantum channel discrimination and quantum metrology, we find the ultimate bounds for the receiver performance, proving that quantum correlations can enhance the SNR by up to 6 dB. These bounds rule out any quantum illumination advantage when the source is strongly amplified, and shows that a relevant gain is possible only in the low photon-number regime. We show how the protocol can be used for covert communication, where the carrier signal is indistinguishable from the thermal noise in the environment. We complement our information-theoretic results with a feasible experimental proposal in a circuit-QED platform. This work makes a decisive step toward implementing secure quantum communication concepts in the previously uncharted 1-10 GHz frequency range, in the scenario when the disposable power of one party is severely constrained.

TI Improving the Capacity of Quantum Dense Coding and the Fidelity of
   Quantum Teleportation by Weak Measurement and Measurement Reversal
SO ENTROPY
AB A protective scheme of quantum dense coding and quantum teleportation of the X-type initial state is proposed in amplitude damping noisy channel with memory using weak measurement and measurement reversal. Compared with the noisy channel without memory, the memory factor improves both the capacity of quantum dense coding and the fidelity of the quantum teleportation to a certain extent for the given damping coefficient. Although the memory factor can inhibit decoherence in some degree, it cannot eliminate it completely. In order to further overcome the influence of the damping coefficient, the weak measurement protective scheme is proposed, which found that the capacity and the fidelity can be efficiently improved by adjusting weak measurement parameter. Another practical conclusion is that, among the three initial states, the weak measurement protective scheme has the best protective effect on the Bell-state in terms of the capacity and the fidelity. For the channel with no memory and full memory, the channel capacity of quantum dense coding reaches two and the fidelity of quantum teleportation reaches one for the bit system; the Bell system can recover the initial state completely with a certain probability. It can be seen that the entanglement of the system can be well protected by the weak measurement scheme, which provides a good support for the realization of quantum communication.

TI Dimensional Expressivity Analysis of Parametric Quantum Circuits
SO QUANTUM
AB Parametric quantum circuits play a crucial role in the performance of many variational quantum algorithms. To successfully implement such algorithms, one must design efficient quantum circuits that sufficiently approximate the solution space while maintaining a low parameter count and circuit depth. In this paper, develop a method to analyze the dimensional expressivity of parametric quantum circuits. Our technique allows for identifying superfluous parameters in the circuit layout and for obtaining a maximally expressive ansatz with a minimum number of parameters. Using a hybrid quantum-classical approach, we show how to efficiently implement the expressivity analysis using quantum hardware, and we provide a proof of principle demonstration of this procedure on IBM's quantum hardware. We also discuss the effect of symmetries and demonstrate how to incorporate or remove symmetries from the parametrized ansatz.

AB Quantum computing promises to execute some tasks exponentially faster than classical computers. Quantum compilation, which transforms algorithms into executable quantum circuits, involves solving the initial mapping problem, crucial for optimizing qubit assignment and minimizing gate error rates. This study explores Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) for initial mapping across various qubit topologies, considering fixed gate error rates. Previous DRL approaches have succeeded but didn't account for fixed error rates, used only one algorithm (PPO), and focused on a single topology with 20 qubits. The trial-and-error nature of Reinforcement Learning makes it ideal for initial mapping. DRL agents, using multiple policy gradient algorithms (A2C, PPO with and without action masking, and TRPO), compute high-quality mappings for small- and medium-scale quantum architectures. While effective, their efficiency decreases with larger systems, necessitating further optimization. Fine-tuning hyperparameters and action masking prevent illegal actions and enhance accuracy. Although currently not surpassing tools like Qiskit or achieving scalability for larger systems, this study highlights DRL's potential for initial mapping in quantum computing, encouraging further innovation and refinement.

TI Detrimental non-Markovian errors for surface code memory
SO QUANTUM SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB The realization of fault-tolerant quantum computers hinges on effective quantum error correction (QEC) protocols, whose performance significantly relies on the nature of the underlying noise. In this work, we directly study the structure of non-Markovian correlated errors and their impact on surface code memory performance. Specifically, we compare surface code performance under non-Markovian noise and independent circuit-level noise, while keeping marginal error rates constant. Our analysis shows that while not all temporally correlated structures are detrimental, certain structures, particularly multi-time 'streaky' correlations affecting syndrome qubits and two-qubit gates, can severely degrade logical error rate scaling. Furthermore, we discuss our results in the context of recent QEC experiments on physical devices. These findings underscore the importance of understanding and mitigating non-Markovian noise toward achieving practical, fault-tolerant quantum computing.

TI Cross-Encoded Quantum Key Distribution Exploiting Time-Bin and
   Polarization States with Qubit-Based Synchronization
SO ADVANCED QUANTUM TECHNOLOGIES
AB Robust implementation of quantum key distribution requires precise state generation and measurements, as well as the choice of an optimal encoding to minimize channel disturbance. Time-bin encoding represent a good candidate for fiber links as birefingence does not perturb this kind of states whereas stable and low-error encoders and decoders are available for polarization encoding. Here a cross-encoded scheme where high accuracy quantum states are prepared through a self-compensating, calibration-free polarization modulator and transmitted using a polarization-to-time-bin converter is presented. The receiver performs time-of-arrival measurements in the key-generation basis and converts qubits back to polarization encoding for measurements in the control basis. Temporal synchronization between the transmitter and receiver is performed with a qubit-based method that does not require additional hardware to share a clock reference. The system is tested in a 12-h run and demonstrates good and stable performance in terms of key and quantum bit error rates. The flexibility of this approach represents an important step toward the development of hybrid networks with both fiber-optic and free-space links.

We propose a method to compensate any state of polarization based on the quantum bit error rate (QBER) of two states from two non-orthogonal mutually unbiased bases. The proposed method does not require dedicated equipment, and through a simple but highly efficient feedback loop it compensates the polarization random drift suffered by photons while transmitted over the optical fiber quantum channel. A QBER lower than 2% was observed even considering imperfect single photon detectors. Besides, we verify a 82% secret key rate generation improvement in a finite-key size BB84 implementation for a 40 km fiber-optics quantum channel.

TI Quantum algorithms for SVD-based data representation and analysis
SO QUANTUM MACHINE INTELLIGENCE
AB This paper narrows the gap between previous literature on quantum linear algebra and practical data analysis on a quantum computer, formalizing quantum procedures that speed-up the solution of eigenproblems for data representations in machine learning. The power and practical use of these subroutines is shown through new quantum algorithms, sublinear in the input matrix's size, for principal component analysis, correspondence analysis, and latent semantic analysis. We provide a theoretical analysis of the run-time and prove tight bounds on the randomized algorithms' error. We run experiments on multiple datasets, simulating PCA's dimensionality reduction for image classification with the novel routines. The results show that the run-time parameters that do not depend on the input's size are reasonable and that the error on the computed model is small, allowing for competitive classification performances.

TI Moving beyond the Transmon: Noise-Protected Superconducting Quantum
   Circuits
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB Artificial atoms realized by superconducting circuits offer unique opportunities to store and process quantum information with high fidelity. Among them, implementations of circuits that harness intrinsic noise protection have been rapidly developed in recent years. These noise-protected devices constitute a new class of qubits in which the computational states are largely decoupled from local noise channels. The main challenges in engineering such systems are simultaneously guarding against both bit- and phase-flip errors, and also ensuring high-fidelity qubit control. Although partial noise protection is possible in superconducting circuits relying on a single quantum degree of freedom, the promise of complete protection can only be fulfilled by implementing multimode or hybrid circuits. This Perspective reviews the theoretical principles at the heart of these new qubits, describes recent experiments, and highlights the potential of robust encoding of quantum information in superconducting qubits.

AB The Key Management System (KMS) is an important component in scaling up from link-to-link key generation to large key distribution networks. In this work we provide an overview of a KMS in the context of Quantum Key Distribution Networks (QKDN) and give a thorough summary of the functionality of a KMS in such an application. Beyond classical QKDNs, we discuss Post Quantum Cryptography (PQC) hybridization techniques at the KMS level. These methods add an additional layer of security against quantum computer driven attacks. We also discuss selected topics regarding the development, deployment and operation of components for such security infrastructure. In addition, relevant standards in the realm of Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) are outlined and analyzed. As some of the necessary interfaces have not been standardized, namely the interface between two KMS instances and the interface between the KMS and the Software Defined Network (SDN) Agent, we propose APIs for these two cases. The design of the interface between the KMS and QKD modules is discussed and, considering their resource constraints, a push mode for the ETSI GS QKD 004 standard is proposed. Finally, implementation details of a prototype KMS are outlined and trade-offs are discussed.

AB We show how to obfuscate pseudo-deterministic quantum circuits, assuming the quantum hardness of learning with errors (QLWE) and post-quantum virtual black-box (VBB) obfuscation for classical circuits. Given the classical description of a quantum circuit Q, our obfuscator outputs a quantum state vertical bar<(Q)over tilde > that can be used to evaluate Q repeatedly on arbitrary inputs.
   Instantiating the VBB obfuscator for classical circuits with any candidate post-quantum indistinguishability obfuscator gives us the first candidate construction of indistinguishability obfuscation for all polynomial-size pseudo-deterministic quantum circuits. In particular, our scheme is the first candidate obfuscator for a class of circuits that is powerful enough to implement Shor's algorithm (SICOMP 1997).
   Our approach follows Bartusek and Malavolta (ITCS 2022), who obfuscate null quantum circuits by obfuscating the verifier of an appropriate classical verification of quantum computation (CVQC) scheme. We go beyond null circuits by constructing a publicly-verifiable CVQC scheme for quantum partitioning circuits, which can be used to verify the evaluation procedure of Mahadev's quantum fully-homomorphic encryption scheme (FOCS 2018). We achieve this by upgrading the one-time secure scheme of Bartusek (TCC 2021) to a fully reusable scheme, via a publicly-decodable Pauli functional commitment, which we formally define and construct in this work. This commitment scheme, which satisfies a notion of binding against committers that can access the receiver's standard and Hadamard basis decoding functionalities, is constructed by building on techniques of Amos, Georgiou, Kiayias, and Zhandry (STOC 2020) introduced in the context of equivocal but collision-resistant hash functions.

TI Quantum for All: Using Social Media to Raise Public Awareness of Quantum
   Technologies
SO INFORMATION
AB Quantum technology has significantly progressed over the last decade. While initially of interest to a narrow circle of professionals and technology enthusiasts, the general public's knowledge of the developments in this domain, as well as the pitfalls and benefits, is currently considered low. As quantum innovations are being integrated into strategic agendas on national and supranational levels, initiatives should be undertaken to raise public awareness about these technologies. The present paper examines the current trends of the implementation of social media, and, in particular, Instagram, by supranational organizations and initiatives to raise public awareness of quantum technology advancements. This research conducts an analysis of topical messages from the Instagram accounts of the International Year of Quantum Science and Technology (IYQ), the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO), and the European Commission account for Digital EU. The study highlights the patterns of social media communication by supranational organizations and initiatives on quantum technologies' properties and provides reflections on the future research avenues to explore public awareness of this disruptive technology. The findings serve as the basis for further research on various aspects of public outreach to inform about the quantum evolution and its potential impact on society, economy, and future digital transformation developments.

TI A NISQ Method to Simulate Hermitian Matrix Evolution

Based on a NISQ module-layered circuit, we propose a heuristic protocol to simulate Hermitian matrix evolution, which is widely applied as the core for many quantum algorithms. The two embedded methods, with their own advantages, only require shallow circuits and basic quantum gates. Capable to being deployed in near future quantum devices, we hope it provides an experiment-friendly way, contributing to the exploitation of power of current devices.

TI Fault-Tolerant Coding for Entanglement-Assisted Communication
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INFORMATION THEORY
AB Channel capacities quantify the optimal rates of sending information reliably over noisy channels. Usually, the study of capacities assumes that the circuits which the sender and receiver use for encoding and decoding consist of perfectly noiseless gates. In the case of communication over quantum channels, however, this assumption is widely believed to be unrealistic, even in the long-term, due to the fragility of quantum information, which is affected by the process of decoherence. Christandl and Muller-Hermes have therefore initiated the study of fault-tolerant channel coding for quantum channels, i.e. coding schemes where encoder and decoder circuits are affected by noise, and have used techniques from fault-tolerant quantum computing to establish coding theorems for sending classical and quantum information in this scenario. Here, we extend these methods to the case of entanglement-assisted communication, in particular proving that the fault-tolerant capacity approaches the usual capacity when the gate error approaches zero. A main tool, which might be of independent interest, is the introduction of fault-tolerant entanglement distillation. We furthermore focus on the modularity of the techniques used, so that they can be easily adopted in other fault-tolerant communication scenarios.

TI Modelling and verification of post-quantum key encapsulation mechanisms
   using Maude
SO PEERJ COMPUTER SCIENCE
AB Communication and information technologies shape the world's systems of today, and those systems shape our society. The security of those systems relies on mathematical problems that are hard to solve for classical computers, that is, the available current computers. Recent advances in quantum computing threaten the security of our systems and the communications we use. In order to face this threat, multiple solutions and protocols have been proposed in the Post-Quantum Cryptography project carried on by the National Institute of Standards and Technologies. The presented work focuses on defining a formal framework in Maude for the security analysis of different postquantum key encapsulation mechanisms under assumptions given under the DolevYao model. Through the use of our framework, we construct a symbolic model to represent the behaviour of each of the participants of the protocol in a network. We then conduct reachability analysis and find a man-in-the-middle attack in each of them and a design vulnerability in Bit Flipping Key Encapsulation. For both cases, we provide some insights on possible solutions. Then, we use the Maude Linear Temporal Logic model checker to extend the analysis of the symbolic system regarding security, liveness and fairness properties. Liveness and fairness properties hold while the security property does not due to the man-in-the-middle attack and the design vulnerability in Bit Flipping Key Encapsulation.

TI Concurrence Percolation in Quantum Networks
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB Establishing long-distance quantum entanglement, i.e., entanglement transmission, in quantum networks (QN) is a key and timely challenge for developing efficient quantum communication. Traditional comprehension based on classical percolation assumes a necessary condition for successful entanglement transmission between any two infinitely distant nodes: they must be connected by at least a path of perfectly entangled states (singlets). Here, we relax this condition by explicitly showing that one can focus not on optimally converting singlets but on establishing concurrence-a key measure of bipartite entanglement. We thereby introduce a new statistical theory, concurrence percolation theory (ConPT), remotely analogous to classical percolation but fundamentally different, built by generalizing bond percolation in terms of "sponge-crossing" paths instead of clusters. Inspired by resistance network analysis, we determine the path connectivity by series and parallel rules and approximate higher-order rules via star-mesh transforms. Interestingly, we find that the entanglement transmission threshold predicted by ConPT is lower than the known classical-percolation-based results and is readily achievable on any series-parallel networks such as the Bethe lattice. ConPT promotes our understanding of how well quantum communication can be further systematically improved versus classical statistical predictions under the limitation of QN locality-a "quantum advantage" that is more general and efficient than expected. ConPT also shows a percolationlike universal critical behavior derived by finite-size analysis on the Bethe lattice and regular two-dimensional lattices, offering new perspectives for a theory of criticality in entanglement statistics.

TI Quantum Computation and Arrows of Time
SO ENTROPY
AB Quantum physics is surprising in many ways. One surprise is the threat to locality implied by Bell's Theorem. Another surprise is the capacity of quantum computation, which poses a threat to the complexity-theoretic Church-Turing thesis. In both cases, the surprise may be due to taking for granted a strict arrow-of-time assumption whose applicability may be limited to the classical domain. This possibility has been noted repeatedly in the context of Bell's Theorem. The argument concerning quantum computation is described here. Further development of models which violate this strong arrow-of-time assumption, replacing it by a weaker arrow which is yet to be identified, is called for.

TI High-dimensional quantum key distribution using energy-time entanglement
   over 242 km partially deployed fiber
SO QUANTUM SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB Entanglement-based quantum key distribution (QKD) is an essential ingredient in quantum communication, owing to the property of source-independent security and the potential on constructing large-scale quantum communication networks. However, implementation of entanglement-based QKD over long-distance optical fiber links is still challenging, especially over deployed fibers. In this work, we report an experimental QKD using energy-time entangled photon pairs that transmit over optical fibers of 242 km (including a section of 19 km deployed fibers). The QKD is realized through the protocol of dispersive-optics QKD (DO-QKD) with high-dimensional encoding to utilize coincidence counts more efficiently. A reliable, high-accuracy time synchronization technology for long-distance entanglement-based QKD is developed based on the distribution of optical pulses in quantum channels. Our system operates continuously for more than 7 d without active polarization or phase calibration. We ultimately generate secure keys with secure key rates of 0.22 bps and 0.06 bps in the asymptotic and finite-size regimes, respectively. It shows that entanglement-based DO-QKD is reliable for long-distance realization in the field if its high requirement on time synchronization is satisfied.

We employ a shallow-depth quantum circuit to implement a unitary and Hermitian operator that block-encodes the weighted maximum cut or the Ising Hamiltonian. Measuring the expectation of this operator on a variational quantum state yields the variational energy of the quantum system. The system is enforced to evolve toward the ground state of the problem Hamiltonian by optimizing a set of angles using normalized gradient descent. Experimentally, our algorithm outperforms the state-of-the-art quantum approximate optimization algorithm on random fully connected graphs and challenges D-Wave quantum annealers by producing good approximate solutions.

TI Rateless Protograph LDPC Codes for Quantum Key Distribution
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON QUANTUM ENGINEERING
AB Information reconciliation (IR) is a key step in quantum key distribution (QKD). In recent years, blind reconciliation based on low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes has replaced Cascade as a standard de facto since it guarantees efficient IR without a priori quantum bit error rate estimation and with limited interactivity between the parties, which is essential in high key-rate and long-distance QKD links. In this article, a novel blind reconciliation scheme based on rateless protograph LDPC codes is proposed. The rate adaptivity, essential for blind reconciliation, is obtained by progressively splitting LDPC check nodes, which ensures a number of degrees of freedom larger than puncturing in code design. The protograph nature of the LDPC codes allows us to use the same designed codes with a large variety of sifted-key lengths, enabling block length flexibility, which is important in largely varying key-rate link conditions. The code design is based on a new protograph discretized density evolution tool.

TI Quantum correlations on the no-signaling boundary: self-testing and more
SO QUANTUM
AB In device-independent quantum information, correlations between local measurement outcomes observed by spatially separated parties in a Bell test play a fundamental role. Even though it is long known that the set of correlations allowed in quantum theory lies strictly between the Bell-local set and the no-signaling set, many questions concerning the geometry of the quantum set remain unanswered. Here, we revisit the problem of when the boundary of the quantum set coincides with the no-signaling set in the simplest Bell scenario. In particular, for each Class of these common boundaries containing k zero probabilities, we provide a (5 - k)-parameter family of quantum strategies realizing these (extremal) correlations. We further prove that self-testing is possible in all nontrivial Classes beyond the known examples of Hardy-type correlations, and provide numerical evidence supporting the robustness of these self testing results. Candidates of one-parameter families of self-testing correlations from some of these Classes are identified. As a byproduct of our investigation, if the qubit strategies leading to an extremal nonlocal correlation are local-unitarily equivalent, a self-testing statement based on this correlation provably follows. Interestingly, all these self-testing correlations found on the no-signaling boundary are provably non-exposed. An analogous characterization for the set M of quantum correlations arising from finite-dimensional maximally entangled states is also provided. En route to establishing this last result, we show that all correlations of M in the simplest Bell scenario are attainable as convex combinations of those achievable using a Bell pair and projective measurements. In turn, we obtain the maximal ClauserHorne-Shimony-Holt Bell inequality violation by any maximally entangled two-qudit state and a no-go theorem regarding the self-testing of such states.

TI Stationary Quantum Entanglement and Asymmetric Steering in Cavity
   Magnonic System with Floquet Field and Coherent Feedback
SO ADVANCED QUANTUM TECHNOLOGIES
AB A scheme is proposed to prepare quantum entanglement and quantum steering between two indirectly coupled microwave cavity modes within a hybrid cavity magnonic system. The system consists of two microwave cavities individually coupled to a common YIG sphere driven by a two-tone Floquet field, while the output field of the second microwave cavity is fed back into the input port of the first microwave cavity via a coherent feedback loop. Floquet driving can effectively generate two interactions between magnons and photons. Magnons with higher dissipation can serve as a cooling channel for the two cavity modes. Optimal quantum correlations between the cavity modes can be achieved when the competition between these two interactions reaches equilibrium. Subsequently, a comparative analysis is performed on the evolution of quantum correlation with and without coherent feedback, revealing that the presence of a coherent feedback loop in the system not only significantly enhances entanglement and steering but also induces inherent asymmetry in quantum steering regardless of the decay rates within subsystems. Moreover, under the influence of the coherent feedback loop, the enhanced quantum correlations exhibit increased robustness against rising environmental temperatures. This work significantly expands the validity of implementation and provides a promising avenue for the preparation of stable quantum correlations.

AB Product development: Given the recent breakthroughs in quantum technology development in R& D labs all over the world, the perspective of high-tech companies has changed. Product development is initiated next to the existing research and technology development activities.
   Quantum computer product roadmap: Considering the quantum computer as a product requires standardization and integration of all its building blocks and a mature supply chain that can provide high-quality components and can ensure security of supply. The product development approach puts focus on functionality and performance requirements of the product and uses state-of-the-art technology to build the product. Based on the expected requirements of future products it is possible to outline a product development roadmap.
   It is expected that a fully functional quantum computer will be available within a decade from now, and will be used by the High Performance Computing (HPC) market, where it will replace (part of) the supercomputers that are currently used for complex calculations and data management. In the short term, a partly functional quantum computer will be available and of interest to the R&D market, which has a need for such a product to expedite their quantum technology developments.
   ImpaQT project: In this paper, we present the product development approach and roadmap for quantum computers, based on superconducting circuits as an example. A group of companies in the Dutch quantum ecosystem (Quantum Delta) have joined forces and have started the ImpaQT project. The companies of the ImpaQT consortium form a local supply chain for key components of quantum computers.
   This paper shows that quantum community has reached the next level of maturity and that the quantum computer as a commercial product looks set to become a reality.

TI Practical overview of image classification with tensor-network quantum
   circuits
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB Circuit design for quantum machine learning remains a formidable challenge. Inspired by the applications of tensor networks across different fields and their novel presence in the classical machine learning context, one proposed method to design variational circuits is to base the circuit architecture on tensor networks. Here, we comprehensively describe tensor-network quantum circuits and how to implement them in simulations. This includes leveraging circuit cutting, a technique used to evaluate circuits with more qubits than those available on current quantum devices. We then illustrate the computational requirements and possible applications by simulating various tensor-network quantum circuits with PennyLane, an open-source python library for differential programming of quantum computers. Finally, we demonstrate how to apply these circuits to increasingly complex image processing tasks, completing this overview of a flexible method to design circuits that can be applied to industrially-relevant machine learning tasks.

TI Mediated semi-quantum key distribution protocol mixing single-state and
   entangled-state
SO EPL
AB - Mediated semi -quantum key distribution (MSQKD) is a popular topic in quantum cryptography, which requires less quantum abilities from legitimate users, Alice and Bob, and has the advantage of high noise tolerance. In this paper, we propose a new MSQKD protocol where the third -party quantum server M can randomly send single -state and entangled -state without informing Alice and Bob of the type of qubit. In addition, in the case where M has an infinite quantum source, we derive the key rate and noise tolerance of the protocol, which proves the unconditional security of the protocol. Furthermore, as M changes the ratio of single -state and entangled -state, the noise tolerance also changes. In particular, when M sends only single -state or entangled -state, our protocol degenerates into the previous MSQKD protocols, and we derive a higher noise tolerance by analysing the mismatch terms.

TI Policies for elementary links in a quantum network
SO QUANTUM
AB Distributing entanglement over long distances is one of the central tasks in quantum networks. An important problem, especially for near-term quantum networks, is to develop optimal entanglement distribution protocols that take into account the limitations of current and near-term hardware, such as quantum memories with limited coherence time. We address this problem by initiating the study of quantum network protocols for entanglement distribution using the theory of decision processes, such that optimal protocols (referred to as policies in the context of decision processes) can be found using dynamic programming or reinforcement learning algorithms. As a first step, in this work we focus exclusively on the elementary link level. We start by defining a quantum decision process for elementary links, along with figures of merit for evaluating policies. We then provide two algorithms for determining policies, one of which we prove to be optimal (with respect to fidelity and success probability) among all policies. Then we show that the previously-studied memory-cutoff protocol can be phrased as a policy within our decision process framework, allowing us to obtain several new fundamental results about it. The conceptual developments and results of this work pave the way for the systematic study of the fundamental limitations of near-term quantum networks, and the requirements for physically realizing them.

TI Simulating Quantum Circuits Using Efficient Tensor Network Contraction
   Algorithms with Subexponential Upper Bound
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB We derive a rigorous upper bound on the classical computation time of finite-ranged tensor network contractions in d >= 2 dimensions. Consequently, we show that quantum circuits of single-qubit and finite-ranged two-qubit gates can be classically simulated in subexponential time in the number of gates. Moreover, we present and implement an algorithm guaranteed to meet our bound and which finds contraction orders with vastly lower computational times in practice. In practically relevant cases this beats standard simulation schemes and, for certain quantum circuits, also a state-of-the-art method. Specifically, our algorithm leads to speedups of several orders of magnitude over naive contraction schemes for two-dimensional quantum circuits on as little as an 8 x 8 lattice. We obtain similarly efficient contraction schemes for Google's Sycamore-type quantum circuits, instantaneous quantum polynomial-time circuits, and nonhomogeneous (2 + 1)-dimensional random quantum circuits.

TI Measurement-Induced Boolean Dynamics for Open Quantum Networks
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON CONTROL OF NETWORK SYSTEMS
AB In this article, we study the recursion corresponding to the measurement outcomes for open quantum networks under sequential measurements. Open quantum networks are networked quantum subsystems (e.g., qubits) with the state evolutions described by a continuous Lindblad master equation. When measurements are performed sequentially along such continuous dynamics, the quantum network states undergo probabilistic jumps and the corresponding measurement outcomes can be described by a vector of probabilistic Boolean variables. The induced recursion of the Boolean vectors forms a probabilistic Boolean network. First of all, we show that the state transition of the induced Boolean network can be explicitly represented through a real version of the master equation. Next, when the open quantum dynamics are relaxing in the sense that they possess a unique equilibrium as a global attractor, structural properties including absorbing states, reducibility, and periodicity for the induced Boolean network are direct consequences of this relaxing property. Particularly, we show that generically, relaxing quantum dynamics leads to irreducible and aperiodic chains for the measurement outcomes. Finally, we show that for quantum consensus networks, which are a type of nonrelaxing open quantum network dynamics, the communication classes of the measurement-induced Boolean networks are encoded in the quantum Laplacian of the underlying interaction graph

TI An In-Depth Comparative Study of Quantum-Classical Encoding Methods for
   Network Intrusion Detection
SO IEEE OPEN JOURNAL OF THE COMMUNICATIONS SOCIETY
AB In today's rapidly evolving cyber landscape, the growing sophistication of attacks, including the rise of zero-day exploits, poses critical challenges for network intrusion detection. Traditional Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs) often struggle with the complexity and high dimensionality of modern cyber threats. Quantum Machine Learning (QML) seamlessly integrates the computational power of quantum computing with the adaptability of machine learning, offering an innovative approach to solving intricate and high-dimensional challenges. A key factor in QML's performance is the method used to encode classical data into quantum states, as it defines how data is represented and processed in quantum circuits. QML offers promising advances for IDS, particularly through hybrid quantum-classical models. This study presents an in-depth comparative analysis of quantum-classical data encoding techniques for QML-based IDS. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to comprehensively evaluate the performance impact of different quantum encoding methods and provide a thorough evaluation of their impacts on the overall model performances. To achieve this, we first present a comprehensive evaluation of quantum and classical data encoding techniques, focusing on four key encoding techniques namely, Amplitude Embedding, Angle Embedding, Instantaneous Quantum Polynomial (IQP) Encoding, and Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) Embedding. Then, we develop a hybrid quantum-classical QML model to analyze how each encoding affects classification performance for malicious traffic. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments using two well-known, real-world network attack datasets to assess the accuracy and efficiency of each encoding approach. Our obtained results show notable differences in classification accuracy, underscoring the importance of encoding choice in optimizing QML-based IDS. This study aims to advance the application of quantum methodologies in network security by identifying effective encoding strategies for intrusion detection.

TI Quantum error mitigation in quantum annealing
SO NPJ QUANTUM INFORMATION
AB Quantum error mitigation (QEM) presents a promising near-term approach to reducing errors when estimating expectation values in quantum computing. Here, we introduce QEM techniques tailored for quantum annealing, using zero-noise extrapolation (ZNE). We implement ZNE through zero-temperature and zero-time extrapolations. The practical zero-time extrapolation developed exploits the Kibble-Zurek mechanism so that only problem-Hamiltonian rescaling is required. We conduct experimental investigations into the quantum critical and post-critical dynamics of a transverse-field Ising spin chain by examining statistics with weak and strong post-critical dynamics. We demonstrate successful mitigation of thermal noise and non-thermal errors through both of these extrapolation techniques.

TI Quantum algorithms for scientific computing
SO REPORTS ON PROGRESS IN PHYSICS
AB Quantum computing promises to provide the next step up in computational power for diverse application areas. In this review, we examine the science behind the quantum hype, and the breakthroughs required to achieve true quantum advantage in real world applications. Areas that are likely to have the greatest impact on high performance computing (HPC) include simulation of quantum systems, optimization, and machine learning. We draw our examples from electronic structure calculations and computational fluid dynamics which account for a large fraction of current scientific and engineering use of HPC. Potential challenges include encoding and decoding classical data for quantum devices, and mismatched clock speeds between classical and quantum processors. Even a modest quantum enhancement to current classical techniques would have far-reaching impacts in areas such as weather forecasting, aerospace engineering, and the design of 'green' materials for sustainable development. This requires significant effort from the computational science, engineering and quantum computing communities working together.

TI Trapped ions quantum logic gate with optical tweezers and the Magnus
   effect
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB We consider the implementation of quantum logic gates in trapped ions using tightly focused optical tweezers. Strong polarization gradients near the tweezer focus lead to qubit-state-dependent forces on the ion. We show that these may be used to implement quantum logic gates on pairs of ion qubits in a crystal. The qubit-state-dependent forces generated by this effect are located on the plane perpendicular to the direction of propagation of the laser beams opening alternate ways of coupling to motional modes of an ion crystal. The proposed gate does not require ground-state cooling of the ions although the waist of the tightly focused beam needs to be comparable to its wavelength in order to achieve the needed field curvature. Furthermore, the gate can be implemented on both ground-state and magnetic-field-insensitive clock-state qubits without the need for counterpropagating laser fields. This simplifies the setup and eliminates errors due to phase instabilities between the gate laser beams. Finally, we show that imperfections in the gate execution, in particular, a 30-nm tweezer alignment error, lead to an infidelity of <^>10-3. In the absence of experimental imperfections and within the limits of the gate model explored in this paper the fidelity is predicted to be <^>0.999 88 when using a Laguerre-Gaussian beam to suppress photon scattering errors.

TI Quantum walk-based protocol for secure communication between any two
   directly connected nodes on a network
SO PHYSICA SCRIPTA
AB The utilization of quantum entanglement as a cryptographic resource has superseded conventional approaches to secure communication. Security and fidelity of intranetwork communication between quantum devices is the backbone of a quantum network. This work presents an protocol that generates entanglement between any two directly connected nodes of a quantum network to be used as a resource to enable quantum communication across that pair in the network. The protocol is based on a directed discrete-time quantum walk and paves the way for private inter-node quantum communication channels in the network. We also present the simulation results of this protocol on random networks generated from various models. We show that after implementation, the probability of the walker being at all nodes other than the source and target is negligible and this holds independent of the random graph generation model. This constitutes a viable method for the practical realisation of secure communication over any random network topology.

TI Testing quantum nonlocality of two-qubit entangled states under
   decoherence
SO ACTA PHYSICA SINICA
AB The quantum nonlocal correlation of quantum states plays an important role in the quantum information and quantum computing protocols. However, during the transmission of entangled states in the quantum channel, they will inevitably interact with the environment, resulting in the degradation of the coherence and then weakening the quantum nonlocal correlation. Using a high probability quantum nonlocal correlation testing scheme based on Hardy-type paradox, in this paper we investigate the quantum nonlocal correlation testing of two-qubit polarization entangled states when they transmit through amplitude damping channel(ADC), phase damping channel (PDC) and depolarization damping channel (DC). The results show that DC has a great influence on the quantum nonlocal correlation testing, while PDC has little influence on the quantum nonlocal correlation testing of quantum states. Finally, this paper also gives condition for the successful quantum nonlocal correlation testing of ADC under weak measurement and quantum weak measurement reversal operation. The results show that when the intensity of weak measurement increases, the influence of ADC decoherence effect on quantum nonlocal correlation testing can be effectively reduced.

TI Selection and Improvement of Product Formulae for Best Performance of
   Quantum Simulation
SO QUANTUM INFORMATION & COMPUTATION
AB Quantum algorithms for simulation of Hamiltonian evolution are often based on product formulae. The fractal methods give a systematic way to find arbitrarily high-order product formulae, but result in a large number of exponentials. On the other hand, product formulae with fewer exponentials can be found by numerical solution of simultaneous non-linear equations. It is also possible to reduce the cost of long-time simulations by processing, where a kernel is repeated and a processor need only be applied at the beginning and end of the simulation. In this work, we found thousands of new product formulae, and numerically tested these formulae, together with many formulae from prior literature. We provide methods to fairly compare product formulae of different lengths and different orders. For the case of 8th order, we have found new product formulae with exceptional performance, about two orders of magnitude better accuracy than prior work, both in the processed and non-processed cases. The processed product formula provides the best performance due to being shorter than the non-processed product formula. It outperforms all other tested product formulae over a range of many orders of magnitude in system parameters T (time) and epsilon (allowable error). That includes reasonable combinations of parameters to be used in quantum algorithms, where the size of the simulation is large enough to be classically intractable, but not so large it takes an impractically long time on a quantum computer.

TI Phase-controlled quantum entanglement and one-way steering in cavity
   magnonic system
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB We study phase-controlled quantum entanglement and one-way quantum steering in a cavity magnonic system, where two magnon modes couple to two microwave cavities driven by squeezed fields. The magnon-magnon entanglement and the steering directivity can be controlled by adjusting the ratio of the coupling strengths between cavity modes and magnon modes. In particular, the quantum entanglement and one-way quantum steering can be significantly enhanced by the squeezed vacuum field, which also exhibits robustness against temperature variations. More intriguingly, both quantum entanglement and steering between two magnon modes are susceptible to variations in the phase difference of two Josephson parametric amplifiers, and thus the phase-controlled quantum entanglement and one-way quantum steering can be achieved. Our scheme may have potential applications in quantum information. (c) 2024 Optica Publishing Group under the terms of the Optica Open Access Publishing Agreement

TI Noise-free on-demand atomic frequency comb quantum memory
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB We present an extension of the atomic frequency comb protocol that utilizes the Stark effect to perform noise-free, on-demand, control. An experimental realization of this protocol was implemented in the Pr3+:Y2SiO5 solid-state system, and a recall efficiency of 38% for a 0.8 mu s storage time was achieved. Experiments were performed with both bright pulses as well as weak-coherent states, the latter achieving a signal-to-noise ratio of 570 +/- 120 using input pulses with an average photon number of similar to 0.1. The principal limitation for a longer storage time was found to be the minimum peak width attainable for Pr3+:Y2SiO5. We employ an adaptation of an established atomic frequency comb model to investigate an on-demand, wide-bandwidth, memory based on Eu3+:Y2SiO5. From this, we determine that a storage time as long as 100 mu s may be practical even without recourse to spin-wave storage.

Density matrices describe probability distributions over quantum states, and in this work we relate the mixedness of density matrices to ambiguity in the sentences they represent. The von Neumann entropy and the fidelity are used as measures of this mixedness. Via the process of amplitude encoding, we introduce classical data into quantum machine learning algorithms. First, the findings suggest that in quantum natural language processing, amplitude-encoding data onto a quantum computer can be a useful tool to improve the performance of the quantum machine learning models used. Second, the effect that these encoded data have on the above-introduced relation between entropy and ambiguity is investigated. We conclude that amplitude-encoding classical data in quantum machine learning algorithms makes the relation between the entropy of a density matrix and ambiguity in the sentence modelled by this density matrix much more intuitively interpretable.

TI Robust suppression of noise propagation in Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill
   error correction
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Straightforward logical operations contrasting with complex state preparation are the hallmarks of the bosonic encoding proposed by Gottesman, Kitaev, and Preskill (GKP). The recently reported generation and error correction of GKP qubits in trapped ions and superconducting circuits thus holds great promise for the future of quantum computing architectures based on such encoded qubits. However, these experiments rely on error-syndrome detection via an auxiliary physical qubit, whose noise may propagate and corrupt the encoded GKP qubit. We propose a simple module composed of two oscillators and a physical qubit, operated with two experimentally accessible quantum gates and elementary feedback controls to implement an error-corrected GKP qubit protected from such propagating errors. In the idealized setting of periodic GKP states, we develop efficient numerical methods to optimize our protocol parameters and show that errors of the encoded qubit stemming from flips of the physical qubit and diffusion of the oscillators state in phase space may be exponentially suppressed as the noise strength over individual operations is decreased. Our approach circumvents the main roadblock towards fault-tolerant quantum computation with GKP qubits.

TI Realization of High-Fidelity Perfect Entanglers between Remote
   Superconducting Quantum Processors
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB Superconducting qubit systems, one of the leading candidates for universal quantum computing, face scalability challenges such as frequency crowding, wiring complexity, and packaging problems. Distributed quantum computing offers a viable strategy for constructing larger quantum information processing systems. Yet, direct universal quantum gates between remote qubits-critical to distributed architectures-remain unrealized. Here, we demonstrate direct high-fidelity entangling gates between two remote superconducting quantum processors separated by a 30 cm distance, utilizing standing-wave modes in their connecting coaxial cable. We achieve cross-entropy benchmarking fidelities of (99.15 + 0.02)% and (98.03 + 0.04)% for the controlled-NOT and controlled-Z gates, respectively, outperforming state transfer and feedback-based protocols in fidelity and efficiency. This advancement significantly enhances the prospect of universal distributed quantum information processing, which is the critical step toward future large-scale quantum systems.

TI Space-efficient binary optimization for variational quantum computing
SO NPJ QUANTUM INFORMATION
AB In the era of Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) computers it is crucial to design quantum algorithms which do not require many qubits or deep circuits. Unfortunately, most of the well-known quantum algorithms are too demanding to be run on currently available quantum devices. Moreover, even the state-of-the-art algorithms developed for the NISQ era often suffer from high space complexity requirements for particular problem classes. In this paper, we show that it is possible to greatly reduce the number of qubits needed for the Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP), a paradigmatic optimization task, at the cost of having deeper variational circuits. While the focus is on this particular problem, we claim that the approach can be generalized for other problems where the standard bit-encoding is highly inefficient. Finally, we also propose encoding schemes which smoothly interpolate between the qubit-efficient and the circuit depth-efficient models. All the proposed encodings have the same volume up to polylogarithmic factors and remain efficient to implement within the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm framework.

TI Quantum computation with logical gates between hot systems
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB We consider quantum computer architectures where interactions are mediated between hot qubits that are not in their mechanical ground state. Such situations occur, e.g., when not cooling ideally, or when moving ions or atoms around. We introduce quantum gates between logically encoded systems that consist of multiple physical ones and show how the encoding can be used to make these gates resilient against such imperfections. We demonstrate that, in this way, one can improve gate fidelities by enlarging the logical system, and counteract the effect of unknown positions or position fluctuations of involved particles. We consider both a classical treatment of positions, in terms of probability distributions, and a quantum treatment using mechanical eigenmodes. We analyze different settings including a cool logical system mediating interactions between two hot systems, as well as two logical systems consisting of hot physical systems whose positions fluctuate collectively or individually. In all cases, assuming ideal local control to logical systems, we demonstrate a significant improvement in gate fidelities, which provides a platform-independent tool to mitigate thermal noise in the context of trapped-particle- based architectures.

TI Random-Receiver Quantum Communication
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB We introduce the task of random-receiver quantum communication, in which a sender transmits a quantum message to a receiver selected from a list of n spatially separated parties. At the moment of transmission, the choice of receiver is unknown to the sender. Later, it becomes known to the n parties, who coordinate their actions by exchanging classical messages. In normal conditions, random-receiver quantum communication requires a noiseless quantum communication channel between the sender and each of the n receivers. In contrast, we show that random-receiver quantum communication can take place through noisy, entanglement-breaking channels if the order of such channels is coherently controlled by a quantum bit that is accessible through measurements. While this phenomenon is achieved with a single control qubit, it cannot be mimicked by adding a noiseless qubit channel from the sender to any of the receivers, or more generally, from the sender to any subset of k < n parties.

AB High fidelity quantum state transfer is an essential part of quantum information processing. In this regard, we address the problem of maximizing the fidelity in a quantum state transformation process satisfying the Liouville-von Neumann equation. By introducing fidelity as the performance index, we aim at maximizing the similarity of the final state density operator with the one of the desired target state. Optimality conditions in the form of a Maximum Principle of Pontryagin are given for the matrix-valued dynamic control systems propagating the probability density function. These provide a complete set of relations enabling the computation of the optimal control strategy. Copyright (C) 2022 The Authors.

TI Simulation and performance analysis of quantum error correction with a
   rotated surface code under a realistic noise model
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB The demonstration of quantum error correction (QEC) is one of the most important milestones in the realization of fully-fledged quantum computers. Toward this, QEC experiments using the surface codes have recently been actively conducted. However, it has not yet been realized to protect logical quantum information beyond the physical coherence time. In this work, we performed a full simulation of QEC for the rotated surface codes with a code distance 5, which employs 49 qubits and is within reach of the current state-of-the-art quantum computers. In particular, we evaluate the logical error probability in a realistic noise model that incorporates not only stochastic Pauli errors but also coherent errors due to a systematic control error or unintended interactions. While a straightforward simulation of 49 qubits is not tractable within a reasonable computational time, we reduced the number of qubits required to 26 qubits by delaying the syndrome measurement in simulation. This and a fast quantum computer simulator, QULACS, implemented on GPU allows us to simulate full QEC with an arbitrary local noise within reasonable simulation time. Based on the numerical results, we also construct and verify an effective model to incorporate the effect of the coherent error into a stochastic noise model. This allows us to understand what the effect coherent error has on the logical error probability on a large scale without full simulation based on the detailed full simulation of a small scale. The present simulation framework and effective model, which can handle arbitrary local noise, will play a vital role in clarifying the physical parameters that future experimental QEC should target.

TI An ultra-high gain single-photon transistor in the microwave regime
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB A photonic transistor that can switch or amplify an optical signal with a single gate photon requires strong non-linear interaction at the single-photon level. Circuit quantum electrodynamics provides great flexibility to generate such an interaction, and thus could serve as an effective platform to realize a high-performance single-photon transistor. Here we demonstrate such a photonic transistor in the microwave regime. Our device consists of two microwave cavities dispersively coupled to a superconducting qubit. A single gate photon imprints a phase shift on the qubit state through one cavity, and further shifts the resonance frequency of the other cavity. In this way, we realize a gain of the transistor up to 53.4 dB, with an extinction ratio better than 20 dB. Our device outperforms previous devices in the optical regime by several orders in terms of optical gain, which indicates a great potential for application in the field of microwave quantum photonics and quantum information processing.
   Successfully controlling an optical signal by a single gate photon would have great applicability for quantum networks and all-optical computing. Here, the authors realise a single-photon transistor in the microwave regime based on superconducting quantum circuits.

TI Analyzing the Data of Software Security Life-Span: Quantum Computing Era
SO INTELLIGENT AUTOMATION AND SOFT COMPUTING
AB Software or web application security is the main objective in the era of Information Technology (IT) and Artificial Intelligence (AI). Distinguishing proof of security at the initial stage produces significant results to comprehend the administration of security relics for best potential outcomes. A security alternative gives several methods and algorithms to ensure the software security. Security estimation is the vital factor in assessing, administrating, controlling security to improve the nature of security. It is to be realized that assessment of security at early stage of development helps in identifying distinctive worms, dangers, weaknesses and threats. This paper will talk about the definition and characterization of quantum computing in software security. For software security, we use different cryptography (methods or algorithms to secure our financial organizations, medical devices, military weapons, planes, ships, automobiles, navigators, etc. However, many cryptosystems are likely to collapse when the large quantum computer is developed. Recently, Google developed the Sycamore Processor 53 qubits. Such innovations indicate the advent of large quantum computer in future. Since cryptographic algorithm can be solved by the quantum computers, the present cryptosystem would be rendered obsolete. Hence, it is imperative to focus more on intensive research in the context of the present quantum cyber security. The main challenges in quantum era would be cryptography methods that fulfill the demands of security usability and flexibility without sacrificing the users' confidence. This research study, in particular, focuses on 'Software durability' which is a quality of security that alludes to the capacity to execution of an item on schedule. In the context of software and web application, a thorough assessment of security factors will significantly influence the software's durability in the era of quantum computing.

TI A Survey of Post-Quantum Cryptography: Start of a New Race
SO CRYPTOGRAPHY
AB Information security is a fundamental and urgent issue in the digital transformation era. Cryptographic techniques and digital signatures have been applied to protect and authenticate relevant information. However, with the advent of quantum computers and quantum algorithms, classical cryptographic techniques have been in danger of collapsing because quantum computers can solve complex problems in polynomial time. Stemming from that risk, researchers worldwide have stepped up research on post-quantum algorithms to resist attack by quantum computers. In this review paper, we survey studies in recent years on post-quantum cryptography (PQC) and provide statistics on the number and content of publications, including a literature overview, detailed explanations of the most common methods so far, current implementation status, implementation comparisons, and discussion on future work. These studies focused on essential public cryptography techniques and digital signature schemes, and the US National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) launched a competition to select the best candidate for the expected standard. Recent studies have practically implemented the public key encryption/key encapsulation mechanism (PKE/KEM) and digital signature schemes on different hardware platforms and applied various optimization measures based on other criteria. Along with the increasing number of scientific publications, the recent trend of PQC research is increasingly evident and is the general trend in the cryptography industry. The movement opens up a promising avenue for researchers in public key cryptography and digital signatures, especially on algorithms selected by NIST.

AB Quantum annealing has emerged in the last few years as a promising quantum computing approach to solving large-scale combinatorial optimization problems. We formulate the problem of correctly placing pressure sensors on a Water Distribution Network (WDN) as a combinatorial optimization problem in the form of a Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) or Ising model. Optimal sensor placement is indeed key to detect and isolate fault events. We outline the QUBO and Ising formulations for the sensor placement problem starting from the network topology and few other features. We present a detailed procedure to solve the problem by minimizing its Hamiltonian using PyQUBO, an open-source Python Library. We then apply our methods to the case of a real Water Distribution Network. Both simulated annealing and a hybrid quantum-classical approach on a D-Wave machine are employed.

TI Optimal quantum control via genetic algorithms for quantum state
   engineering in driven-resonator mediated networks
SO QUANTUM SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB We employ a machine learning-enabled approach to quantum state engineering based on evolutionary algorithms. In particular, we focus on superconducting platforms and consider a network of qubits-encoded in the states of artificial atoms with no direct coupling-interacting via a common single-mode driven microwave resonator. The qubit-resonator couplings are assumed to be in the resonant regime and tunable in time. A genetic algorithm is used in order to find the functional time-dependence of the couplings that optimise the fidelity between the evolved state and a variety of targets, including three-qubit GHZ and Dicke states and four-qubit graph states. We observe high quantum fidelities (above 0.96 in the worst case setting of a system of effective dimension 96), fast preparation times, and resilience to noise, despite the algorithm being trained in the ideal noise-free setting. These results show that the genetic algorithms represent an effective approach to control quantum systems of large dimensions.

In this work, we establish a comprehensive and practical fault-tolerance framework for such a hybrid system and synthesize it with fault-tolerant protocols by combining bosonic quantum error correction (QEC) and advanced quantum control techniques. We introduce essential building blocks of error-corrected gadgets by leveraging ancilla-assisted bosonic operations using a generalized variant of path-independent quantum control. Using these building blocks, we construct a universal set of errorcorrected gadgets that tolerate a single-photon loss and an arbitrary ancilla fault for four-legged cat qubits. Notably, our construction requires only dispersive coupling between bosonic modes and ancillae, as well as beam-splitter coupling between bosonic modes, both of which have been experimentally demonstrated with strong strengths and high accuracy. Moreover, each error-corrected bosonic qubit is comprised of only a single bosonic mode and a three-level ancilla, featuring the hardware efficiency of bosonic QEC in the full fault-tolerant setting. We numerically demonstrate the feasibility of our schemes using current experimental parameters in the circuit-QED platform. Finally, we present a hardware-efficient architecture for faulttolerant quantum computing by concatenating the four-legged cat qubits with an outer qubit code utilizing only beam-splitter couplings. Our estimates suggest that the overall noise threshold can be reached using existing hardware. These developed fault-tolerant schemes extend beyond their applicability to four-legged cat qubits and can be adapted for other rotation-symmetrical codes, offering a promising avenue toward scalable and robust quantum computation with bosonic qubits.

TI Correlations in Quantum Network Topologies Created with Cloning
SO MATHEMATICS
AB With progress in quantum technologies, the field of quantum networks has emerged as an important area of research. In the last few years, there has been substantial progress in understanding the correlations present in quantum networks. In this article, we study cloning as a prospective method to generate three party quantum networks which will help us to create larger networks. We analyze various quantum network topologies that can be created using cloning transformations. This would be useful in situations wherever the availability of entangled pairs is limited. In addition to that, we focus on the problem of distinguishing networks created by cloning from those that are created by distributing independently generated entangled pairs. We find that there are several states that cannot be distinguished using the Finner inequalities in the standard way. For such states, we propose an extension to the existing Finner inequality for triangle networks by further increasing the number of observers from three to four or six depending on the network topology. This takes into account the additional correlations that exist in the case of cloned networks. In the last part of the article, we use tripartite mutual information to distinguish cloned networks from networks created by independent sources and further use squashed entanglement as a measure to quantify the amount of dependence in the cloned networks.

TI Resisting High-Energy Impact Events through Gap Engineering in
   Superconducting Qubit Arrays
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB Quantum error correction (QEC) provides a practical path to fault-tolerant quantum computing through scaling to large qubit numbers, assuming that physical errors are sufficiently uncorrelated in time and space. In superconducting qubit arrays, high-energy impact events can produce correlated errors, violating this key assumption. Following such an event, phonons with energy above the superconducting gap propagate throughout the device substrate, which in turn generate a temporary surge in quasiparticle (QP) density throughout the array. When these QPs tunnel across the qubits' Josephson junctions, they induce correlated errors. Engineering different superconducting gaps across the qubit's Josephson junctions provides a method to resist this form of QP tunneling. By fabricating all-aluminum transmon qubits with both strong and weak gap engineering on the same substrate, we observe starkly different responses during high-energy impact events. Strongly gap engineered qubits do not show any degradation in T1 during impact events, while weakly gap engineered qubits show events of correlated degradation in T1. We also show that strongly gap engineered qubits are robust to QP poisoning from increasing optical illumination intensity, whereas weakly gap engineered qubits display rapid degradation in coherence. Based on these results, gap engineering mitigates the threat of high-energy impacts to QEC in superconducting qubit arrays.

AB Individual quarks and gluons at smalinside an unpolarized hadron can be regarded as Bell states i which qubits in the spin and orbital angular momentum spaces are maximally entangled. Using the machinery of quantum information science, we generalize this observation to all values 0<x<1 and describe gluons (but not quarks) as maximally entangled states between a qubit and a qudit. We introduce the conditional probability distributio P & eth;lzjsz of a gluon's orbital angular momentumlz given its helicity s(z). Restricting to the three states l(z) =0;+/- 1, which constitute a qutrit, we explicitly computePas afunction of x.

TI Quantum simulation of open quantum systems in heavy-ion collisions
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW D
AB We present a framework to simulate the dynamics of hard probes such as heavy quarks or jets in a hot, strongly coupled quark-gluon plasma (QGP) on a quantum computer. Hard probes in the QGP can be treated as open quantum systems governed in the Markovian limit by the Lindblad equation. However, due to large computational costs, most current phenomenological calculations of hard probes evolving in the QGP use semiclassical approximations of the quantum evolution. Quantum computation can mitigate these costs and offers the potential for a fully quantum treatment with exponential speed-up over classical techniques. We report a simplified demonstration of our framework on IBM Q quantum devices and apply the random identity insertion method to account for CNOT depolarization noise, in addition to measurement error mitigation. Our work demonstrates the feasibility of simulating open quantum systems on current and near-term quantum devices, which is of broad relevance to applications in nuclear physics, quantum information, and other fields.

TI On-chip spin-photon entanglement based on photon-scattering of a quantum
   dot
SO NPJ QUANTUM INFORMATION
AB The realization of on-chip quantum interfaces between flying photons and solid-state spins is a key building block for quantum-information processors, enabling, e.g., distributed quantum computing, where remote quantum registers are interconnected by flying photons. Self-assembled quantum dots integrated into nanostructures are one of the most promising systems for such an endeavor thanks to their near-unity photon-emitter coupling and fast spontaneous emission rate. Here we demonstrate high-fidelity on-chip entanglement between an incoming photon and a stationary quantum-dot hole spin qubit. The entanglement is induced by sequential scattering of the time-bin encoded photon interleaved with active spin control within a microsecond, two orders of magnitude faster than those achieved in other solid-state platforms. Conditioning on the detection of a reflected photon renders the entanglement fidelity immune to the spectral wandering of the emitter. These results represent a major step towards realizing a quantum node capable of interchanging information with flying photons and on-chip quantum logic, as required for quantum networks and quantum repeaters.

TI Accelerated Quantum Monte Carlo with Mitigated Error on Noisy Quantum
   Computer
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB Quantum Monte Carlo and quantum simulation are both important tools for understanding quantum many-body systems. As a classical algorithm, quantum Monte Carlo suffers from the sign problem, preventing its application to most fermion systems and real-time dynamics. In this paper, we introduce a novel nonvariational algorithm using quantum simulation as a subroutine to accelerate quantum Monte Carlo by easing the sign problem. The quantum subroutine can be implemented with shallow circuits and, by incorporating error mitigation, can reduce the Monte Carlo variance by several orders of magnitude even when the circuit noise is significant. As such, the proposed quantum algorithm is applicable to near-term noisy quantum hardware.

TI Quantum algorithm for electronic band structures with local
   tight-binding orbitals
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB While the main thrust of quantum computing research in materials science is to accurately measure the classically intractable electron correlation effects due to Coulomb repulsion, designing optimal quantum algorithms for simpler problems with well-understood solutions is a useful tactic to advance our quantum "toolbox". With this in mind, we consider the quantum calculation of a periodic system's single-electron band structure over a path through reciprocal space. Previous efforts have used the Variational Quantum Eigensolver algorithm to solve the energy of each band, which involves numerically optimizing the parameters of a variational quantum circuit to minimize a cost function, constructed as the expectation value of a Hamiltonian operator. Traditionally, a unique Hamiltonian operator is constructed for each k-point, so that many cost functions, each with their own parameter space, must be optimized to generate a single band. Similarly, calculating higher bands than the first has traditionally involved modifying the cost function with additional overlap terms to ensure higher-energy eigenstates are orthogonal to those of lower bands. In this paper, we adopt a direct space approach, using a novel hybrid first/second-quantized qubit mapping which allows us to construct a single Hamiltonian, and a single cost-function, suitable for solving the entire electronic band structure. In contrast to previous approaches, the k-point and the band index are selected by additional parameters in our quantum circuit, rather than through modifications to the cost function. The result is a technically and conceptually simpler approach to band structure calculations on a quantum computer. Moreover, we expect that the tools developed herein will motivate new strategies for tackling highly-correlated materials beyond the grasp of classical computing.

TI Quantum entanglement detection and classification of multipartite
   WW state under the white noise environment
SO ACTA PHYSICA SINICA
AB Entanglement detection and classification of multipartite systems remain the key topics in the field of quantum information and science. In this work, we take advantage of the nature that quantum Fisher information (QFI) can witness multipartite entanglement to comprehensively investigate the entanglement detection and classification of multi-qubit WW states immersed in a white noise environment. In the situation of local operation, by combining the information of the known quantum state, we have presented a criterion with visibility for witnessing the genuine multipartite entanglement and another for identifying the presence of quantum entanglement. Specifically, with respect to the 5-qubit WW state and 6-qubit WW state, due to the fact that the maximum QFI of their splitting-structure states exceeds that of the original states, it is infeasible to strictly establish a criterion for detecting the genuine multipartite entanglement. However, we delineate the scope for inferring the possible entanglement structures. Furthermore, it is found that as the number of qubits increases, the conditions for witnessing the genuine multipartite entanglement become increasingly strict, while those for detecting the existence of entanglement grow relatively more relaxed. Taking into account the likelihood of the crosstalk between neighboring qubits during the local operations on the multipartite systems in experiments, we employ the Lipkin-Meshkov-Glick (LMG) model to explore the entanglement classification of diverse multi-qubit multipartite states. It is found that with the increasing interaction strength, even for the strong white noise, the WW states can still be distinguished, thereby resolving the challenge of managing the entanglement classification under local operation. Besides, as the interaction strength continues to increase, the task of entanglement classification becomes more straightforward. This fully shows the superiority of nonlocal operations over local operations in the aspect of entanglement classification.

AB Distributed Quantum Computing (DQC) provides a scalable architecture by interconnecting multiple quantum processor units (QPUs). Among various DQC implementations, quantum data centers (QDCs) - where QPUs in different racks are connected through reconfigurable optical switch networks - are becoming feasible in the near term. However, the latency of cross-rack communications and dynamic switch reconfigurations poses unique challenges to communications in QDCs, significantly increasing the overall latency, thereby also reducing the overall fidelity. In this paper, we address these challenges by introducing a novel compiler that optimizes scheduling of communications across the program and network layers. Our evaluation shows that it reduces the overall latency by 8.02x over prior approaches with a small overhead and can be integrated with quantum error correction (QEC) to facilitate fault-tolerant quantum computing (FTQC). We have open-sourced our codes at https://zenodo.org/records/15377656.

TI Gaussian quantum entanglement in curved spacetime
SO RESULTS IN PHYSICS
AB The influence of Hawking radiation on quantum entanglement for bimodal Gaussian states near a Schwarzschild black hole is investigated. It is shown that for a thermal squeezed state of a bimodal bosonic system the Hawking radiation reduces and even can destroy the entanglement between the mode of a Kruskal observer Alice and the mode of Bob, who is an accelerated observer hovering outside the event horizon of black hole. By contrary, the Hawking radiation increases and even can generate quantum entanglement between Bob and anti-Bob, who is a hypothetical observer inside event horizon. We show that in both these scenarios the competition between the contrary influences produced by Hawking temperature, squeezing and field frequency, may favour the preservation of the quantum entanglement. We investigate also the influence of the thermal environment on the behaviour in time of the entanglement between the considered observers and show that the entanglement is destroyed in a finite time for both considered bipartite scenarios of observers Alice and Bob, and respectively Bob and anti-Bob, for non-zero values of the temperature of the thermal environment, i.e. the phenomenon of entanglement sudden death takes place. For a zero temperature of the thermal bath the initial existing entanglement is decreasing over time, but it keeps for all finite times a non-zero value and the logarithmic negativity tends to zero only in the limit of infinite time.

TI Excited State Search Using Quantum Annealing
SO JOURNAL OF THE PHYSICAL SOCIETY OF JAPAN
AB Quantum annealing (QA) is one of the ways of finding ground states of problem Hamiltonians. We initially apply transverse fields corresponding to a driver Hamiltonian and adiabatically change the Hamiltonian to the problem Hamiltonian to obtain the target ground state. However, for some purposes such as quantum chemistry, both ground and excited states are needed to understand the properties of the molecules. Here, we describe a scheme based on QA to search arbitrary excited states of problem Hamiltonians. By splitting the degeneracy of the driver Hamiltonian with inhomogeneous transverse fields, we can prepare a nondegenerate excited state as the initial state, and an adiabatic change of the Hamiltonian provides a target excited state as long as the adiabatic condition holds. We also show that our scheme enables us to find a desired excited state by designing the driver Hamiltonian suitably even in the presence of weak decoherence. These results are important for quantum chemistry and post-quantum cryptography.

TI Four-Dimensional Spaces of Complex Numbers and Unitary States of
   Two-Qubit Quantum Systems
SO SYMMETRY-BASEL
AB The pure states of two-qubit quantum systems are described by a four-dimensional vector of complex numbers, and unitary operators transferring a two-qubit quantum system from one state to another have the form of a 4x4 matrix with complex elements. This fact brings to mind the idea of studying the spaces of four-dimensional numbers with complex components. Moreover, the results obtained by the authors for four-dimensional numbers with real components inspire some optimism. In this paper we construct four-dimensional spaces of complex numbers by analogy with four-dimensional spaces of real numbers. Each four-dimensional number is mapped to a matrix formed from its components and it is proved that the constructed mapping is a bijection and a homomorphism. In the space of four-dimensional numbers of the eight basis elements, half are real and half are imaginary. The presence of such symmetry distinguishes these spaces from the space of quaternions, in which one basis element is real and the rest are imaginary. The symmetry of the basis numbers makes these spaces a natural generalization of one-dimensional and two-dimensional (complex) algebra. The conditions under which the corresponding matrices are gates for two-qubit quantum systems are defined. The notion of a unitary state of a two-qubit quantum system is introduced, to which various gates from commutative groups of gates correspond. It is shown that any gate of a unitary state transforms a unitary state into a unitary state and a non-unitary state into a non-unitary state. Almost all gates used in the construction of quantum circuits, in particular H, SWAP, CX, CY, and CZ, have the same properties. The problem of searching for a gate that transfers a quantum system from one unitary state to another unitary state has been solved. Thus, with the help of four-dimensional spaces of complex numbers it was possible to construct whole classes of two-qubit gates, which opens new possibilities for the construction of quantum algorithms. The results obtained have important theoretical and practical implications for quantum computing.

TI Mem-Transistor-Based Gaussian Error-Generating Hardware for Post-Quantum
   Cryptography Applications
SO ADVANCED QUANTUM TECHNOLOGIES
AB Quantum computing can potentially hack the information encrypted by traditional cryptographic systems, leading to the development of post-quantum cryptography (PQC) to counteract this threat. The key principle behind PQC is the "learning with errors" problem, where intentional errors make encrypted information unpredictable. Intentional errors refer to Gaussian distributed data. However, implementing Gaussian distributed errors is challenging owing to computational and memory overhead. Therefore, this study proposes a Gaussian error sampler that employs the intrinsic Gaussian properties of nanometer-scale semiconductor devices. The proposed Gaussian error sampler significantly reduces computational and memory overhead. This work comprehensively evaluates the effectiveness of the proposed device by conducting statistical normality tests and generating quantile-quantile plots. The optimal programming voltage is identified to be -5.25 V, and the experimental results confirmed the Gaussian distribution of error data generated by the proposed module, aligning closely with software-generated Gaussian distributions and distinct from uniform random distributions.

SO NATURE PHYSICS
AB Stabilization of encoded logical qubits using quantum error correction is crucial for the realization of reliable quantum computers. Although error-correcting codes implemented using individual physical qubits require many separate systems to be controlled, codes constructed using a quantum oscillator offer the possibility to perform error correction with a single physical entity. One powerful encoding approach for oscillators is the grid state or Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill (GKP) encoding, which allows small displacement errors to be corrected. Here we introduce and implement a dissipative map designed for physically realistic finite GKP codes, which performs quantum error correction of a logical qubit encoded in the motion of a single trapped ion. The correction cycle involves two rounds, which correct small displacements in position and momentum. We demonstrate an extension in coherence time of logical states by a factor of three using both square and hexagonal GKP codes. The simple dissipative map used for this correction can be viewed as a type of reservoir engineering, which pumps into the manifold of highly non-classical GKP qubit states.
   Physical systems with continuous degrees of freedom can be used to implement quantum error correction codes. An autonomous correction protocol has now been used to extend the lifetime of a qubit encoded in the motion of a trapped ion.

TI Quantum correlations in a cluster spin model with three-spin
   interactions
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICS A-MATHEMATICAL AND THEORETICAL
AB An exactly solvable cluster spin model with three-spin interaction couplings Jx(for XZX spin components) and J(y)(for YZY spin components) in the presence of a transverse magnetic field h for a spin chain is investigated. For h = 0, and with only one non-zero interaction strength, the ground state is the cluster state. Through the Jordan-Wigner fermion mapping, the odd sites and the even sites form two separate transverse-XY chains, connected only through the boundary terms. Consequently, all measures of quantum correlations for nearest neighbour spins, the concurrence, the quantum mutual information and the quantum discord are all zero in the ground state. The dynamics is spin conserving for J(y)=J(x), exhibiting a line of critical points for |h/J(x)|<= 2, with an uncorrelated direct product ground state for |h/J(x)|>2. There are several quantum critical points in the parameter space, with multi-fold degenerate ground states. The magnetisation and the global entanglement measure exhibit strong singular features for the spin conserving case. The next-neighbour quantum correlation measures are investigated analytically, which exhibit singular features in the vicinity of degeneracy critical points. The J(y)- and h- derivatives of the concurrence exhibit singular peak behaviour near the degeneracy critical points, except in the spin conserving case where the derivatives are zero.

TI Advanced 3D Integration Technologies in Various Quantum Computing
   Devices
SO IEEE OPEN JOURNAL OF NANOTECHNOLOGY
AB As a key approach to augment Moore's Law scaling, 3D integration technologies have enabled small form factor, low cost, diverse, modular and flexible assembly of integrated circuits in the semiconductor industry. It is therefore essential to adopt these technologies to the quantum computing devices which are at the nascent stage and generally require large scale integration to be practical. In this review, we focus on four popular quantum bit (qubit) candidates (trapped ion, superconducting circuit, silicon spin and photon) which are encoded by distinct physical systems but all intrinsically compatible with advanced CMOS fabrication process. We introduce the specific scalability bottlenecks of each qubit type and present the current solutions using 3D integration technologies. We evaluate and classify these technologies into three main categories based on the hierarchy. A brief discussion regarding the thermal management is also provided. We believe this review serves to provide some useful insights on the contributions of interconnect, integration and packaging to the field of quantum computing where rapid development is ongoing.

TI Extended-Josephson-junction qubit system
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Circuit quantum electrodynamics (QED) has emerged as a promising platform for implementing quantum computation and simulation. Typically, junctions in these systems are of a sufficiently small size, such that only the lowest plasma oscillation is relevant. The interplay between the Josephson effect and charging energy renders this mode nonlinear, forming the basis of a qubit. In this work, we introduce a QED architecture based on extended Josephson junctions (JJs), which possess a non-negligible spatial extent. We present a comprehensive microscopic analysis and demonstrate that each extended junction can host multiple nonlinear plasmon modes, effectively functioning as a multiqubit interacting system, in contrast to conventional JJs. Furthermore, the phase modes exhibit distinct spatial profiles, enabling individual addressing through frequency-momentum selective coupling to photons. Our platform has potential applications in quantum computation, specifically in implementing single- and two-qubit gates within a single junction. We also investigate a setup comprising several driven extended junctions interacting via a multimode electromagnetic resonator. This configuration serves as a powerful platform for simulating the generalized Bose-Hubbard model, as the photon-mediated coupling between junctions can create a lattice in both real and synthetic dimensions. This allows for the exploration of quantum phenomena, such as topological phases of interacting many-body systems.

TI Heralded Entanglement Distribution Between Two Spin-Wave Memories Using
   Temporally Multiplexed Scheme
SO LASER & PHOTONICS REVIEWS
AB The elementary link, which is formed by entanglement between two remote atomic ensembles, is a fundamental component of Duan-Lukin-Cirac-Zoller (DLCZ) quantum repeater. For practical realization of quantum repeaters, it is required that entanglement between two atomic-ensemble-based memories can be generated with high rates and retrieved with high efficiencies. However, so far, such quantum-repeater links remain challenge in experiments. Here, heralded entanglement distribution between atomic-ensemble-based memories is demonstrated via temporally multiplexed scheme. A train of 12 write pulses in time is applied to a cloud of cold atoms along different directions, which generates temporally multiplexed pairs of Stokes photons and spin waves via DLCZ processes. The Stokes fields propagating in the two spatial modes, which are paired with two spin waves are combined to perform a single-photon Bell-state measurement. A successful detection projects the two spin waves into a single-excitation entanglement, which represents entanglement distribution in an elementary link. Compared with single-mode storage scheme, the temporally multiplexed scheme gives rise to a 11.8-fold increase in entanglement generation rate. By using cavity-enhanced scheme, spin waves stored in the atoms are retrieved on demand and the retrieval efficiencies are up to 70%, which is beneficial for the subsequent entanglement swapping between adjacent links.

TI Scalable Authentication and Optimal Flooding in a Quantum Network
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB The global interest in quantum networks stems from the security guaranteed by the laws of physics. The deployment of quantum networks means facing the challenges of scaling up the physical hardware and, more importantly, of scaling up all other network layers and optimally utilizing network resources. Here, we consider two related protocols and their experimental demonstrations on an eight-user quantum network test bed, and discuss their usefulness with the aid of example use cases. First, we consider an authentication-transfer protocol to manage a fundamental limitation of quantum communication-the need for a preshared key between every pair of users linked together on the quantum network. By temporarily trusting some intermediary nodes for a short period of time (< 35 min in our network), we can generate and distribute these initial authentication keys with a very high level of security. Second, when end users quantify their trust in intermediary nodes, our flooding protocol can be used to improve both end-to-end communication speeds and increase security against malicious nodes.

TI Quantum Computing Based Design of Multivariate Porous Materials
SO ACS CENTRAL SCIENCE
AB Multivariate (MTV) porous materials exhibit unique structural complexities based on their diverse spatial arrangements of multiple building block combinations. These materials possess potential synergistic functionalities that exceed the sum of their individual components. However, the exponentially increasing design complexity of these materials poses significant challenges for accurate ground-state configuration prediction and design. To address this, we propose a Hamiltonian model for quantum computing that integrates compositional, structural, and balance constraints directly into the Hamiltonian, enabling efficient optimization of the MTV configurations. The model employs a graph-based representation to encode linker types as qubits. Our framework enables quantum encoding of a vast linker design space, allowing representation of exponentially many configurations with linearly scaling qubit resources, and facilitating efficient search for optimal structures based on predefined design variables. To validate our model, a variational quantum circuit was constructed and executed using the Sampling Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) algorithm in the IBM Qiskit. Simulations on experimentally known MTV porous materials (e.g., Cu-THQ-HHTP, Py-MV-DBA-COF, MUF-7, and SIOC-COF2) successfully reproduced their ground-state configurations, demonstrating the validity of our model. Furthermore, VQE calculations were performed on a real IBM 127-qubit quantum hardware for validation purposes signaling a first step toward a practical quantum algorithm for the rational design of porous materials.

TI Noise suppression in a temporal-multimode quantum memory entangled with
   a photon via an asymmetrical photon-collection channel
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Quantum interfaces (QIs) that generate entanglement between a multimode atomic memory and a photon form a multiplexed repeater node and could greatly improve quantum repeater rates. Recently, a temporal multimode spin-wave memory entangled with a photon was demonstrated with cold atoms [Wen et al., Phys. Rev. A 100, 012342 (2019)]. However, due to the additional noise generated in a multimode operation, the fidelity of the spin-wave-photon entanglement significantly decreases with the mode number. So far, improvements in the temporal-multimode entanglement fidelity associated with suppressing the additional noise have not been explored. In this work, we propose and experimentally demonstrate a scheme that can suppress the additional noise of a temporally multiplexed QI. The scheme uses an asymmetric channel to retrieve the photons coming from the temporally multiplexed QI. For comparison purposes, we also set up a QI that uses a symmetric channel for photon collection. When the QIs store 14 modes, the measured Bell parameters S for the QIs using the asymmetric and the symmetric photon-collection channels are 2.36 +/- 0.03 and 2.24 +/- 0.04, respectively, which means that a QI using an asymmetric channel provides a 3% increase in the entanglement fidelity, i.e., a 1.7-fold decrease in the additional noise, compared with a QI using a symmetric channel. In addition, the 14-mode entanglement QIs that use the asymmetric and symmetric collections preserve the violation of a Bell inequality for storage times of up to similar to 25 and similar to 20 mu s, respectively, showing that the asymmetric QI has better entanglement storage performance.

TI Investigating the impact of clock frequency stability on practical
   quantum key distribution
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB Qubit-based synchronization offers an approach for quantum key distribution (QKD), simplifying system architecture and reducing implementation costs by leveraging the exchanged qubits. However, the performance of such schemes hinges on accumulating sufficient qubit events, making them sensitive to local clock frequency instability, especially under high channel loss. This study investigates the impact of frequency instability in non-ideal oscillators, emphasizing clock drift-induced deterioration on QKD performance in these challenging, lossy conditions. We simulate the performance of actual QKD key generation rates under optimal acquisition times for different levels of channel loss. Experimental validation, using QKD systems with two distinct clock configurations, confirms secure key generation and reliable operation up to 67 dB channel loss. We propose this model as a general tool for evaluating and optimizing the synchronization subsystems within the broader quantum communication infrastructure.

TI Quantum Annealing for Computer Vision minimization problems
SO FUTURE GENERATION COMPUTER SYSTEMS-THE INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ESCIENCE
AB Computer Vision (CV) labeling problems play a pivotal role in low-level vision. For decades, it has been known that these problems can be elegantly formulated as discrete energy -minimization problems derived from probabilistic graphical models such as Markov Random Fields (MRFs). Despite recent advances in MRF inference algorithms (such as graph -cut and message -passing methods), the resulting energy -minimization problems are generally viewed as intractable. The emergence of quantum computations, which offer the potential for faster solutions to certain problems than classical methods, has led to an increased interest in utilizing quantum properties to overcome intractable problems. Recently, there has also been a growing interest in Quantum Computer Vision (QCV), hoping to provide a credible alternative/assistant to deep learning solutions. This study investigates a new Quantum Annealing -based inference algorithm for CV discrete energy minimization problems. Our contribution is focused on Stereo Matching as a significant CV labeling problem. As a proof of concept, we also use a hybrid quantum-classical solver provided by D -Wave System to compare our results with the best classical inference algorithms in the literature. Our results show that Quantum Annealing can yield promising results for Stereo Matching problems, with improved accuracy on certain stereo images and competitive performance on others.

TI Empirical coordination of separable quantum correlations
SO AIMS MATHEMATICS
AB We introduce the notion of empirical coordination for quantum correlations. Quantum mechanics enables the calculation of probabilities for experimental outcomes, emphasizing statistical averages rather than detailed descriptions of individual events. Empirical coordination is thus a natural framework for quantum systems. Focusing on the cascade network, the optimal coordination rates are established, indicating the minimal resources required to simulate, on average, a quantum state. As we consider a network with classical communication links, superposition cannot be maintained, hence the quantum correlations are separable (i.e., a convex combination of product states). This precludes entanglement. Providing the users with shared randomness, before communication begins, does not affect the optimal rates for empirical coordination. We begin with a rate characterization for a basic two-node network, and then generalize to a cascade network. The special case of a network with an isolated node is considered as well. The results can be further generalized to other networks as our analysis includes a generic achievability scheme. The optimal rate formula involves optimization over a collection of state extensions. This is a unique feature of the quantum setting, as the classical parallel does not include optimization. As demonstrated through examples, the performance depends heavily on the choice of decomposition. We further discuss the consequences of our results for quantum cooperative games.

TI Solving transport equations on quantum computers-potential and
   limitations of physics-informed quantum circuits
SO CEAS AERONAUTICAL JOURNAL
AB Quantum circuits with trainable parameters, paired with classical optimization routines can be used as machine learning models. The recently popularized physics-informed neural network (PINN) approach is a machine learning algorithm that solves differential equations by incorporating them into a loss function. Being a mesh-free method, it is a promising approach for computational fluid dynamics. The question arises whether the properties of quantum circuits can be leveraged for a quantum physics-informed machine learning model. In this study, we compare the classical PINN-ansatz and its quantum analog, which we name the physics-informed quantum circuit (PIQC). The PIQC simulations are performed on a noise-free quantum computing simulator. Studying various differential equations, we compare expressivity, accuracy and convergence properties. We find that one-dimensional problems, such as the linear transport of a Gaussian-pulse or Burgers' equation, allow a successful approximation with the classical and the quantum ansatz. For these examples, the PIQC overall performs similarly to PINN and converges more consistently and for Burgers' equations even faster. While this is promising, the chosen quantum circuit approach struggles to approximate discontinuous solutions which the classical PINN-ansatz can represent. Based on this comparison, we extrapolate that the required number of qubits for solving two-dimensional problems in aerodynamics may already be available in the next few years. However, the acceleration potential is currently unclear and challenges like noisy circuits and approximations of discontinuous solutions have to be overcome.

TI Computational Power of Random Quantum Circuits in Arbitrary Geometries
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW X
AB Empirical evidence for a gap between the computational powers of classical and quantum computers has been provided by experiments that sample the output distributions of two-dimensional quantum circuits. Many attempts to close this gap have utilized classical simulations based on tensor network techniques, and their limitations shed light on the improvements to quantum hardware required to frustrate classical simulability. In particular, quantum computers having in excess of approximately 50 qubits are primarily vulnerable to classical simulation due to restrictions on their gate fidelity and their connectivity, the latter determining how many gates are required (and, therefore, how much infidelity is suffered) in generating highly entangled states. Here, we describe recent hardware upgrades to Quantinuum's H2 quantum computer, enabling it to operate on up to 56 qubits with arbitrary connectivity and 99.843(5)% two-qubit gate fidelity. We define a class of circuits with random geometries that become hard to classically simulate in very low depth and implement them utilizing the flexible connectivity of H2. A careful analysis demonstrating the fast saturation of classical simulation complexity with depth indicates that H2 can yield data well beyond the reach of state-of-the art classical simulation methods at unprecedented fidelities. We find that the considerable difficulty of classically simulating H2 is likely limited only by qubit number, demonstrating the promise and scalability of the quantum charge-coupled device architecture as continued progress is made toward building larger machines.

TI Fault-tolerant quaternary belief propagation decoding based on a neural
   network
SO FRONTIERS IN PHYSICS
AB The article discusses the challenge of finding an efficient decoder for quantum error correction codes for fault-tolerant experiments in quantum computing. The study aims to develop a better decoding scheme based on the flag-bridge fault tolerance experiment. The research compares two decoding algorithms, a deep neural network decoding scheme and a simple decoder, and a recurrent neural network decoding scheme based on the belief propagation algorithm variant MBP4 algorithm. The study improved the syndrome extraction circuit based on the flag-bridge method to meet the requirements of fault-tolerant experiments better. Two decoding schemes were studied, a combination of a deep neural network and a simple decoder and a recurrent neural network structure based on the MBP4 algorithm. The first scheme used neural networks to assist simple decoders in determining whether additional logical corrections need to be added. The second scheme used a recurrent neural network structure designed through the variant MBP4 algorithm, along with a post-processing method to pinpoint the error qubit position for decoding. Experimental results showed that the decoding scheme developed in the study improved the pseudo-threshold by 39.52% compared to the minimum-weight perfect matching decoder. The two decoders had thresholds of approximately 15.8% and 16.4%, respectively. The study's findings suggest that the proposed decoding schemes could improve quantum error correction and fault-tolerant experiments in quantum computing.

TI Expanding the scope of quantum annealing applicability
SO AIP ADVANCES
AB With the emergence of D-wave's quantum annealing machine, the power of quantum computing has become tangible, and the development of quantum computers is accelerating rapidly. Unfortunately, at present, the minimum value search that D-wave's quantum annealing machine can handle is limited to quadratic functions of binary integer variables. This constraint is due to both hardware and software limitations. If this constraint was to be lifted, it would undoubtedly bring about a revolution in the world. Therefore, in this study, we obtained the basic mathematics of using quantum annealing, which enables hyper-parallel computing using qubits, to find the global minimum of any minimum value problem. Furthermore, we conducted simple simulations using classical computers to demonstrate the effectiveness of the ideas and algorithms. Furthermore, we conducted simple simulations using classical computers to demonstrate the effectiveness of the ideas and algorithms.

TI Tunable and Transferable Diamond Membranes for Integrated Quantum
   Technologies
SO NANO LETTERS
AB Color centers in diamond are widely explored as qubits in quantum technologies. However, challenges remain in the effective and efficient integration of these diamond-hosted qubits in device heterostructures. Here, nanoscale-thick uniform diamond membranes are synthesized via "smart-cut" and isotopically (C-12) purified overgrowth. These membranes have tunable thicknesses (demonstrated 50 to 250 nm), are deterministically transferable, have bilaterally atomically flat surfaces (R-q <= 0.3 nm), and bulk-diamond-like crystallinity. Color centers are synthesized via both implantation and in situ overgrowth incorporation. Within 110-nm-thick membranes, individual germanium-vacancy (GeV-) centers exhibit stable photoluminescence at 5.4 K and average optical transition line widths as low as 125 MHz. The room temperature spin coherence of individual nitrogen-vacancy (NV-) centers shows Ramsey spin dephasing times (T-2*) and Hahn echo times (T-2) as long as 150 and 400 mu s, respectively. This platform enables the straightforward integration of diamond membranes that host coherent color centers into quantum technologies.

TI Exact Quantum Sensing Limits for Bosonic Dephasing Channels
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB Dephasing is a prominent noise mechanism that afflicts quantum information carriers, and it is one of the main challenges toward realizing useful quantum computation, communication, and sensing. Here, we consider discrimination and estimation of bosonic dephasing channels, when using the most general adaptive strategies allowed by quantum mechanics. We reduce these difficult quantum problems to simple classical ones based on the probability densities defining the bosonic dephasing channels. By doing so, we rigorously establish the optimal performance of various distinguishability and estimation tasks and construct explicit strategies to achieve this performance. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first example of a non-Gaussian bosonic channel for which there are exact solutions for these tasks.

TI Unique entanglement time evolution of two-qubit product separable and
   extended Werner-like states in a discrete qubit environment
SO PHYSICA SCRIPTA
AB This study investigates the parameters affecting the entanglement time evolution of product separable (PS) and extended Werner-like (EWL)states in homogeneous, white noise, and mixed environments. In a pure homogeneous environment, both states demonstrate complete entanglement revivals, where an increase in the number of environments leads to an attenuation of concurrence. The PS state exhibits gaps and never reaches a maximum entanglement, whereas maximum purity EWL states(Bell states) maintain or periodically reach maximum entanglement. Hence, the PS and EWL states have a disjoint entanglement time evolution subspaces. Interestingly, the environment interaction and subsystem coupling interaction that influence entanglement have an inverse time relationship under a constant value of concurrence. Placing the system of interest in a white noise environment induces entanglement dissipation, with the dissipation time dependent on the width of random distribution of interaction strengths rather than the magnitude of interaction strength. In a distinct qubit environment, the entanglement time evolution of the PS state depends on the distribution of the number of environments. Moreover, combining homogeneous and white noise environments results in entanglement dynamics that exhibit characteristics of both homogeneous and white noise

TI On Depth, Robustness and Performance Using the Data Re-Uploading
   Single-Qubit Classifier
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB Quantum machine learning (QML) is a new field in its infancy, promising performance enhancements over many classical machine learning (ML) algorithms. Data reuploading is a QML algorithm with a focus on utilizing the power of a singular qubit as an individually capable classifier. Recently, there have been studies set out to explore the concept of data re-uploading in a classification setting, however, important aspects are often not considered in experiments, which may hinder our understanding of the methodology's performance. In this work, we conduct an analysis of the single-qubit data re-uploading methodology, in relation to the effect that system depth has on classification and robustness performances against the influence of environmental noise during training. This is aimed towards bridging together previous works in order to solidify the concepts of the methodology, and provide reasonable insight into how transferable the methodology is when applied to non-synthetic data. To further demonstrate the findings, we also analyse the results of a case study using a subset of MNIST data. From this work, our experimental results support that an increase in system depth can lead to higher classification performances, as well as improved stability during training in noisy environments, with the sharpest performance improvements seemingly occurring between 1-3 uploading layer repetitions. Leading on from our experimental results, we suggest areas for further exploration, to ensure we can maximize classification performance when using the data re-uploading methodology.

TI Metropolis-style random sampling of quantum gates for the estimation of
   low-energy observables
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW D
AB We propose a quantum algorithm to compute low-energy expectation values of a quantum Hamiltonian by sampling a partition function associated with the average energy of that Hamiltonian. For any given quantum circuit-Hamiltonian pair, there is an associated average energy. The sampling is done through an accept/reject Metropolis-style algorithm on the quantum gates of the circuit itself. Observables calculated under the canonical ensemble from these samples of circuits are extrapolated from higher energies to the ground state.

TI Demonstrating a Long-Coherence Dual-Rail Erasure Qubit Using Tunable
   Transmons
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW X
AB Quantum error correction with erasure qubits promises significant advantages over standard error correction due to favorable thresholds for erasure errors. To realize this advantage in practice requires a qubit for which nearly all errors are such erasure errors, and the ability to check for erasure errors without dephasing the qubit. We demonstrate that a "dual-rail qubit" consisting of a pair of resonantly coupled transmons can form a highly coherent erasure qubit, where transmon T-1 errors are converted into erasure errors and residual dephasing is strongly suppressed, leading to millisecond-scale coherence within the qubit subspace. We show that single-qubit gates are limited primarily by erasure errors, with erasure probability perasure =2.19(2)x10(-3) per gate while the residual errors are similar to 40 times lower. We further demonstrate mid-circuit detection of erasure errors while introducing <0.1% dephasing error per check. Finally, we show that the suppression of transmon noise allows this dual-rail qubit to preserve high coherence over a broad tunable operating range, offering an improved capacity to avoid frequency collisions. This work establishes transmon-based dual-rail qubits as an attractive building block for hardware-efficient quantum error correction.

TI Experimental direct quantum communication with squeezed states
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB Quantum secure direct communication (QSDC) is an evolving quantum communication framework based on transmitting secure information directly through a quantum channel, without relying on key-based encryption such as in quantum key distribution (QKD). Optical QSDC protocols, utilizing discrete and continuous variable encodings, show great promise for future technological applications. We present the first table-top continuous-variable QSDC proof of principle, analyzing its implementation and comparing the use of coherent against squeezed light sources. A simple beam-splitter attack is analyzed by using Wyner wiretap channel theory. Our study illustrates the advantage of squeezed states over coherent ones for enhanced security and reliable communication in lossy and noisy channels. Our practical implementation, utilizing mature telecom components, could foster secure quantum metropolitan networks compatible with advanced multiplexing systems.

TI QuaSiMo: A composable library to program hybrid workflows for quantum
   simulation
SO IET QUANTUM COMMUNICATION
AB A composable design scheme is presented for the development of hybrid quantum/classical algorithms and workflows for applications of quantum simulation. The proposed object-oriented approach is based on constructing an expressive set of common data structures and methods that enables programming of a broad variety of complex hybrid quantum simulation applications. The abstract core of the scheme is distilled from the analysis of the current quantum simulation algorithms. Subsequently, it allows synthesis of new hybrid algorithms and workflows via the extension, specialisation, and dynamic customisation of the abstract core classes defined by the proposed design. The design scheme is implemented using the hardware-agnostic programming language QCOR into the QuaSiMo library. To validate the implementation, the authors test and show its utility on commercial quantum processors from IBM and Rigetti, running some prototypical quantum simulations.

TI Low-Power System Model for Quantum Entangled Photon-Pair Source
SO JOURNAL OF SYSTEMS ENGINEERING AND ELECTRONICS
AB The quantum entangled photon-pair source, as an essential component of optical quantum systems, holds great potential for applications such as quantum teleportation, quantum computing, and quantum imaging. The current workhorse technique for preparing photon pairs involves performing spontaneous parametric down conversion (SPDC) in bulk nonlinear crystals. However, the current power consumption and cost of preparing entangled photon-pair sources are relatively high, posing challenges to their integration and scalability. In this paper, we propose a low-power system model for the quantum entangled photon-pair source based on SPDC theory and phase matching technology. This model allows us to analyze the performance of each module and the influence of component characteristics on the overall system. In our experimental setup, we utilize a 5 mW laser diode and a typical type-II barium metaborate (BBO) crystal to prepare an entangled photon-pair source. The experimental results are in excellent agreement with the model, indicating a significant step towards achieving the goal of low-power and low-cost entangled photon-pair sources. This achievement not only contributes to the practical application of quantum entanglement lighting, but also paves the way for the widespread adoption of optical quantum systems in the future.

TI Native qudit entanglement in a trapped ion quantum processor
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Quantum information carriers, just like most physical systems, naturally occupy high-dimensional Hilbert spaces. Instead of restricting them to a two-level subspace, these high-dimensional (qudit) quantum systems are emerging as a powerful resource for the next generation of quantum processors. Yet harnessing the potential of these systems requires efficient ways of generating the desired interaction between them. Here, we experimentally demonstrate an implementation of a native two-qudit entangling gate up to dimension 5 in a trapped-ion system. This is achieved by generalizing a recently proposed light-shift gate mechanism to generate genuine qudit entanglement in a single application of the gate. The gate seamlessly adapts to the local dimension of the system with a calibration overhead that is independent of the dimension.
   Encoding quantum information in qudits instead of qubits allows for several advantages, but scalable native entangling techniques would be needed. Here, the authors show how to use light-shift gates to perform entangling operations on trapped ion systems, with a calibration overhead which is independent on the qudit dimension.

TI Coherent optical-microwave interface for manipulation of low-field
   electronic clock transitions in

SO NPJ QUANTUM INFORMATION
AB The coherent interaction of solid-state spins with both optical and microwave fields provides a platform for a range of quantum technologies, such as quantum sensing, microwave-to-optical quantum transduction and optical quantum memories. Rare-earth ions with electronic spins are interesting in this context. In this work, we use a loop-gap microwave resonator to coherently drive optical and microwave clock transitions simultaneously in a Yb-171(3+):Y2SiO5 crystal, achieving a Rabi frequency of 0.56 MHz at 2.497 GHz over a 1-cm long crystal. Furthermore, we provide insights into the spin dephasing at very low fields, showing that superhyperfine-induced collapse of the Hahn echo plays an important role. Our calculations and measurements reveal that the effective magnetic moment can be manipulated in Yb-171(3+):Y2SiO5, which suppresses the superhyperfine interaction at the clock transition. At a doping concentration of 2 ppm and 3.4 K, we achieve spin coherence time of 10.0 +/- 0.4 ms.

TI Comparing quantum and classical machine learning for Vector Boson
   Scattering background reduction at the Large Hadron Collider
SO QUANTUM MACHINE INTELLIGENCE
AB We report on a consistent comparison between techniques of quantum and classical machine learning applied to the classification of signal and background events for the Vector Boson Scattering processes, studied at the Large Hadron Collider installed at the CERN laboratory. Quantum machine learning algorithms based on variational quantum circuits are run on freely available quantum computing hardware, showing very good performances as compared to deep neural networks run on classical computing facilities. In particular, we show that such kind of quantum neural networks is able to correctly classify the targeted signal with an Area Under the characteristic Curve (AUC) that is very close to the one obtained with the corresponding classical neural network, but employing a much lower number of resources, as well as less variable data in the training set. Albeit giving a proof-of-principle demonstration with limited quantum computing resources, this work represents one of the first steps towards the use of near term and noisy quantum hardware for practical event classification in High Energy Physics experiments.

TI Cavity-enhanced and temporally multiplexed atom-photon entanglement
   interface
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB Practical realization of quantum repeaters requires quantum memories with high retrieval efficiency, multi-mode storage capacities, and long lifetimes. Here, we report a high-retrieval-efficiency and temporally multiplexed atom-photon entanglement source. A train of 12 write pulses in time is applied to a cold atomic ensemble along different directions, which generates temporally multiplexed pairs of Stokes photons and spin waves via Duan-Lukin-Cirac-Zoller processes. The two arms of a polarization interferometer are used to encode photonic qubits of 12 Stokes temporal modes. The multiplexed spin-wave qubits, each of which is entangled with one Stokes qubit, are stored in a "clock" coherence. A ring cavity that resonates simultaneously with the two arms of the interferometer is used to enhance retrieval from the spin-wave qubits, with the intrinsic retrieval efficiency reaching 70.4%. The multiplexed source gives rise to a similar to 12.1-fold increase in atom-photon entanglement-generation probability compared to the single-mode source. The measured Bell parameter for the multiplexed atom-photon entanglement is 2.21(2), along with a memory lifetime of up to similar to 125 mu s.

TI Spin-augmented observables for efficient photonic quantum error
   correction
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB We demonstrate that the spin state of solid-state emitters inside micropillar cavities can serve as measure qubits in syndrome measurements. The photons, acting as data qubits, interact with the spin state in the microcavity and the total state of the system evolves conditionally due to the resulting circular birefringence. By performing a quantum nondemolition measurement on the spin state the syndrome of the optical state can be obtained. Furthermore, due to the symmetry of the interaction, we can alternatively choose to employ the optical states as measure qubits. This protocol can be adapted to various resource requirements, including spectral discrepancies between the data qubits, by considering entangled measure qubits. Finally, we discuss how spin-systems with dissimilar characteristic energies can still be entangled with high levels of fidelity and tolerance to cavity losses in the strong coupling regime.

TI Experimental quantum simulation of a topologically protected Hadamard
   gate via braiding Fibonacci anyons
SO INNOVATION
AB Topological quantum computation (TQC) is one of the most striking archi-tectures that can realize fault-tolerant quantum computers. In TQC, the logical space and the quantum gates are topologically protected, i.e., robust against local disturbances. The topological protection, however, requires complicated lattice models and hard-to-manipulate dynamics; even the simplest system that can realize universal TQC-the Fibonacci anyon sys-tem-lacks a physical realization, let alone braiding the non-Abelian anyons. Here, we propose a disk model that can simulate the Fibonacci anyon sys-tem and construct the topologically protected logical spaces with the Fibo-nacci anyons. Via braiding the Fibonacci anyons, we can implement univer-sal quantum gates on the logical space. Our disk model merely requires two physical qubits to realize three Fibonacci anyons at the boundary. By 15 sequential braiding operations, we construct a topologically protected Ha-damard gate, which is to date the least-resource requirement for TQC. To showcase, we implement a topological Hadamard gate with two nuclear spin qubits, which reaches 97.18% fidelity by randomized benchmarking. We further prove by experiment that the logical space and Hadamard gate are topologically protected: local disturbances due to thermal fluctuations result in a global phase only. As a platform-independent proposal, our work is a proof of principle of TQC and paves the way toward fault-tolerant quantum computation.

AB Controlled operations are fundamental building blocks of quantum algorithms. Decomposing n-control-NOT gates (Cn(X)) into arbitrary single-qubit and CNOT gates, is a crucial but non-trivial task. This study introduces Cn(X) circuits outperforming previous methods in the asymptotic and nonasymptotic regimes. Three distinct decompositions are presented: an exact one using one borrowed ancilla with a circuit depth Tolog onTHORN 3 THORN, an approximating one without ancilla qubits with a circuit depth Oolog onTHORN3 logo1=.THORNTHORN and an exact onewith an adjustable-depth circuit which decreaseswith the number m=n of ancilla qubits available as Oolog on=bm=2cTHORN3 + logobm=2cTHORNTHORN.

TI Quantum Computation of a Quasiparticle Band Structure with the
   Quantum-Selected Configuration Interaction
SO JOURNAL OF THE PHYSICAL SOCIETY OF JAPAN
AB Quasiparticle band structures are fundamental for understanding strongly correlated electron systems. While solving these structures accurately on classical computers is challenging, quantum computing offers a promising alternative. Specifically, the quantum subspace expansion (QSE) method, combined with the variational quantum eigensolver (VQE), provides a quantum algorithm for calculating quasiparticle band structures. However, optimizing the variational parameters in VQE becomes increasingly difficult as the system size grows, due to device noise, statistical noise, and the barren plateau problem. To address these challenges, we propose a hybrid approach that combines QSE with the quantum-selected configuration interaction (QSCI) method for calculating quasiparticle band structures. QSCI may leverage the VQE ansatz as an input state but, unlike the standard VQE, it does not require full optimization of the variational parameters, making it more scalable for larger quantum systems. Based on this approach, we demonstrate the quantum computation of the quasiparticle band structure of a silicon using 16 qubits on an IBM quantum processor.

TI The Quantum Amplitude Estimation Algorithms on Near-Term Devices: A
   Practical Guide
SO QUANTUM REPORTS
AB The Quantum Amplitude Estimation (QAE) algorithm is a major quantum algorithm designed to achieve a quadratic speed-up. Until fault-tolerant quantum computing is achieved, being competitive over classical Monte Carlo (MC) remains elusive. Alternative methods have been developed so as to require fewer resources while maintaining an advantageous theoretical scaling. We compared the standard QAE algorithm with two Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ)-friendly versions of QAE on a numerical integration task, with the Monte Carlo technique of Metropolis-Hastings as a classical benchmark. The algorithms were evaluated in terms of the estimation error as a function of the number of samples, computational time, and length of the quantum circuits required by the solutions, respectively. The effectiveness of the two QAE alternatives was tested on an 11-qubit trapped-ion quantum computer in order to verify which solution can first provide a speed-up in the integral estimation problems. We concluded that an alternative approach is preferable with respect to employing the phase estimation routine. Indeed, the Maximum Likelihood estimation guaranteed the best trade-off between the length of the quantum circuits and the precision in the integral estimation, as well as greater resistance to noise.

TI High-quality single InGaAs/GaAs quantum dot growth on a silicon
   substrate for quantum photonic applications
SO OPTICA QUANTUM
AB Developing non-classical light sources for use in quantum information technology is a primary goal of quantum nanophotonics. Significant progress has been made in this area using quantum dots grown on III/V semiconductor substrates. However, it is crucial to develop quantum light sources based on silicon wafers to facilitate largescale integration of electronic circuits and quantum photonic structures. We present a method for the direct heteroepitaxial growth of high-quality InGaAs quantum dots on silicon, which enables the fabrication of scalable and cost-effective quantum photonics devices that are compatible with silicon technology. To achieve high-quality GaAs heterostructures, we apply an intermediate GaP buffer and defect-reducing layers on a silicon substrate. The epitaxially grown quantum dots exhibit optical and quantum-optical properties similar to reference ones based on conventional GaAs substrates. The distributed Bragg reflector used as a backside mirror enables us to achieve bright emission with up to (18 +/- 1)% photon extraction efficiency. Additionally, the quantum dots exhibit strong multi-photon suppression with g(2)(tau) = (3.7 +/- 0.2) x 10-2and high photon indistinguishability V = (66 +/- 19)% under non-resonant excitation. These results indicate the high potential of our heteroepitaxy approach in the field of silicon-compatible quantum nanophotonics. Our approach can pave the way for future chips that combine electronic and quantum photonic functionality.

AB Optical quantum computers represent qubits as photons created by laser and implement arbitrary quantum operations through Mach-Zehnder interferometers (MZIs) which is called linear optical quantum computing (LOQC). Since the number of qubits and quantum system is getting bigger, we need a scalable and universal quantum computing platform based on LOQC. In this work, we propose a software framework which can support a universal programming with flexibility of LOQC hardware configuration. The framework consists of four parts such as decomposer, mapper, controller, and user-interface controller. As an example, we show a use case of this framework for Bell state generation on Reck et al.'s MZI network.

TI Prime number factorization using a spinor Bose-Einstein
   condensate-inspired topological quantum computer
SO QUANTUM INFORMATION PROCESSING
AB Inspired by non-abelian vortex anyons in spinor Bose-Einstein condensates, we consider the quantum double D(Q(8)) anyon model as a platform to carry out a particular instance of Shor's factorization algorithm. We suggest that the D(Q(8)) anyon model could be realized by a specific low-temperature phase of a spin-2 Bose-Einstein condensate. We provide the excitation spectrum for this model, as well as the fusion rules, braid group representations, and a circuit architecture that facilitates the computation. All necessary quantum gates, less one, can be compiled exactly for this hybrid topological quantum computer. The required non-topological gate could be implemented using measurement based protocols. To analyze the effect of decoherence on the non-topological gate, a noise model based on stochastic unitary rotations is considered. The computational potential of this quantum double anyon model is similar to that of the Majorana fermion-based Ising anyon model, thus offering a complementary future platform for topological quantum computation.

TI Quantum state transfer between distant optomechanical interfaces via
   shortcut to adiabaticity
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB We propose a protocol to realize fast high-fidelity quantum state transfer between distant optomechanical interfaces connected by a continuum waveguide. The scheme consists of three steps: two accelerating adiabatic processes joined by a population conversion process. In comparison to the traditional adiabatic technique, our method reaches a higher transfer fidelity with a shorter time. Numerical results show that the fidelity of this transfer scheme in the dissipative system mainly depends on the protocol speed and the coupling strength of the waveguide and cavities. Assisted by inverting the pulse sequence, bidirectional transfer can be implemented, indicating the potential to build a quantum network.

TI Linear optical quantum computing with a hybrid squeezed-cat code
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB In recent years, squeezed-cat codes with resilience to specific types of loss have been proposed as a step toward realizing fault-tolerant optical quantum computers. However, error correction for squeezed-cat codes requires a strong nonlinearity, which makes its implementation challenging with current technology. We propose a novel hybrid code that combines the squeezed-cat code and the polarization qubit. First, we propose a generation method and a universal gate set that can be implemented with a linear optical system. Then we show the superiority of the hybrid squeezed-cat code over the hybrid cat code and the squeezed-cat code through numerical simulations. These results demonstrate that the hybrid squeezed-cat code is a promising candidate as a new resource for optical quantum information processing.

TI Deep learning optimal quantum annealing schedules for random Ising

SO NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB A crucial step in the race towards quantum advantage is optimizing quantum annealing using ad-hoc annealing schedules. Motivated by recent progress in the field, we propose to employ long-short term memory neural networks to automate the search for optimal annealing schedules for random Ising models on regular graphs. By training our network using locally-adiabatic annealing paths, we are able to predict optimal annealing schedules for unseen instances and even larger graphs than those used for training.

TI Introducing quantum information and computation to a broader audience
   with MOOCs at OpenHPI
SO EPJ QUANTUM TECHNOLOGY
AB Quantum computing is an exciting field with high disruptive potential, but very difficult to access. For this reason, many approaches to teaching quantum computing are being developed worldwide. This always raises questions about the didactic concept, the content actually taught, and how to measure the success of the teaching concept. In 2022 and 2023, the authors taught a total of nine two-week MOOCs (massive open online courses) with different possible learning paths on the Hasso Plattner Institute's OpenHPI platform. The purpose of the platform is to make computer science education available to everyone free of charge. The nine quantum courses form a self-contained curriculum. A total of more than 17,000 course attendances have been taken by about 7400 natural persons, and the number is still rising. This paper presents the course concept and evaluates the anonymized data on the background of the participants, their behaviour in the courses, and their learning success. This paper is the first to analyze such a large dataset of MOOC-based quantum computing education. The summarized results are a heterogeneous personal background of the participants biased towards IT professionals, a majority following the didactic recommendations, and a high success rate, which is strongly correlatated with following the didactic recommendations. The amount of data from such a large group of quantum computing learners provides many avenues for further research in the field of quantum computing education. The analyses show that the MOOCs are a low-threshold concept for getting into quantum computing. It was very well received by the participants. The concept can serve as an entry point and guide for the design of quantum computing courses.

TI Expressibility of the alternating layered ansatz for quantum computation
SO QUANTUM
AB The hybrid quantum-classical algorithm is actively examined as a technique applicable even to intermediate-scale quantum computers. To execute this algorithm, the hardware efficient ansatz is often used, thanks to its implementability and expressibility; however, this ansatz has a critical issue in its trainability in the sense that it generically suffers from the so-called gradient vanishing problem. This issue can be resolved by limiting the circuit to the class of shallow alternating layered ansatz. However, even though the high trainability of this ansatz is proved, it is still unclear whether it has rich expressibility in state generation. In this paper, with a proper definition of the expressibility found in the literature, we show that the shallow alternating layered ansatz has almost the same level of expressibility as that of hardware efficient ansatz. Hence the expressibility and the trainability can coexist, giving a new designing method for quantum circuits in the intermediate-scale quantum computing era.

TI Polygamy Relation of Quantum Correlations with Equality
SO ADVANCED QUANTUM TECHNOLOGIES
AB This study provides a generalized definition of polygamy relations for any quantum correlation measures. Instead of the usual polygamy inequality, a polygamy relation with equality is given by introducing the polygamy weight. From the polygamy relation with equality, it presents polygamy inequalities satisfied by the beta th (beta > 0) power of the quantum correlation measures. Taking concurrence of assistance as an example, it further illustrates the significance and advantages of these relations. It also obtains a polygamy relation with equality by considering the one-to-group entanglements for any quantum entanglement measures that do not satisfy the polygamy relations. It demonstrates that such relations for tripartite states can be generalized to multipartite systems.

TI Universal and Ultrafast Quantum Computation Based on
   Free-Electron-Polariton Blockade
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB Cavity QED, wherein a quantum emitter is coupled to electromagnetic cavity modes, is a powerful platform for implementing quantum sensors, memories, and networks. However, due to the fundamental trade-off between gate fidelity and execution time, as well as limited scalability, the use of cavity QED for quantum computation was overtaken by other architectures. Here, we introduce a new element into cavity QED-a free charged particle, acting as a flying qubit. Using free electrons as a specific example, we demonstrate that our approach enables ultrafast, deterministic, and universal discrete -variable quantum computation in a cavity -QED -based architecture, with potentially improved scalability. Our proposal hinges on a novel excitation blockade mechanism in a resonant interaction between a free -electron and a cavity polariton. This nonlinear interaction is faster by several orders of magnitude with respect to current photon -based cavity -QED gates, enjoys wide tunability and can demonstrate fidelities close to unity. Furthermore, our scheme is ubiquitous to any cavity nonlinearity, either due to light -matter coupling as in the Jaynes -Cummings model or due to photon -photon interactions as in a Kerr -type many -body system. In addition to promising advancements in cavity -QED quantum computation, our approach paves the way towards ultrafast and deterministic generation of highly entangled photonic graph states and is applicable to other quantum technologies involving cavity QED.

TI Quantum neural compressive sensing for ghost imaging
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW APPLIED
AB Demonstrating the utility of quantum algorithms is a long-standing challenge, where quantum machine learning becomes one of the most promising candidates that can be resorted to. In this study, we investigate a quantum neural compressive-sensing algorithm for ghost imaging to showcase its utility. The algorithm utilizes the variational quantum circuits to reparameterize the inverse problem of ghost imaging and uses the inductive bias of the physical forward model to perform optimization. To validate the algorithm's effectiveness, we conduct optical ghost-imaging experiments, capturing signals from objects at different physical sampling rates and detection signal-to-noise ratios. The experimental results show that our proposed algorithm surpasses conventional methods in both visual appearance and quantitative metrics, achieving state-of-the-art performance. Of note, we observe that the quantum neural network, guided by prior knowledge of physics, effectively overcomes the challenge of barren plateau in the optimization process. The proposed algorithm demonstrates robustness against various quantum noise levels, making it suitable for near-term quantum devices. Our study leverages a physical inductive-bias-guided variational quantum algorithm, underscoring the potential of quantum computation in tackling a broad range of optimization and inverse problems.

TI Universal control of a six-qubit quantum processor in silicon
SO NATURE
AB Future quantum computers capable of solving relevant problems will require a large number of qubits that can be operated reliably(1). However, the requirements of having a large qubit count and operating with high fidelity are typically conflicting. Spins in semiconductor quantum dots show long-term promise(2,3) but demonstrations so far use between one and four qubits and typically optimize the fidelity of either single- or two-qubit operations, or initialization and readout(4-11). Here, we increase the number of qubits and simultaneously achieve respectable fidelities for universal operation, state preparation and measurement. We design, fabricate and operate a six-qubit processor with a focus on careful Hamiltonian engineering, on a high level of abstraction to program the quantum circuits, and on efficient background calibration, all of which are essential to achieve high fidelities on this extended system. State preparation combines initialization by measurement and real-time feedback with quantum-non-demolition measurements. These advances will enable testing of increasingly meaningful quantum protocols and constitute a major stepping stone towards large-scale quantum computers.

TI Analyzing the research impact in post quantum cryptography through
   scientometric evaluation
SO DISCOVER COMPUTING
AB The accelerated pace of development in the Field of Quantum Computing is very alarming for many of the presently used cryptographic algorithms such as RSA and ECC underlying much of security in the modern world. This is an indication that the need for development of quantum-resistant algorithms especially for security in data integrity and communication in the environment driven by quantum computers, commonly referred to as Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC). For addressing this, the Research presents a scientometric lenses on PQC to provide a systematic review of its related research terrain, thematic trends and key contributors for directionality purposes. In the scientific aspect, the work uses new-generation scientometric techniques, including co-words, thematic maps, and network diagrams based on 2874 articles sourced from the WoS and SCOPUS databases, which were systematically evaluated using the PRISMA protocol in R Studio. Such an approach could help disentangle the publication profiles, collaborative structures, and emergent institutionalization of PQC research. Identified insights demonstrate that the growth pattern of PQC has become steeper, with the number of annual publications reaching 623 in 2023, where Florida Atlantic University and Tsinghua University are also the most active institutions. Despite this progress, major research gaps persist, particularly in scaling PQC algorithms, cross-platform adaptability, and testing in real-world settings, which are essential for applications in constrained environments like IoT networks. Thus, this study sets a foundation of reference on PQC research and presents noble advice to scholars, legislators, and entrepreneurs. These findings make the case for constant development and reliable procedures to safeguard computational assets from new forms of attack posed by quantum computing and, in doing so, point to an exciting future in the post-quantum world.

TI SpinQ Gemini: a desktop quantum computing platform for education and
   research
SO EPJ QUANTUM TECHNOLOGY
AB SpinQ Gemini is a commercial desktop quantum computing platform designed and manufactured by SpinQ Technology. It is an integrated hardware-software system. The first generation product with two qubits was launched in January 2020. The hardware is based on NMR spectrometer, with permanent magnets providing similar to 1 T magnetic field. SpinQ Gemini operates under room temperature (0-30 degrees C), highlighting its lightweight (55 kg with a volume of 70 x 40 x 80 cm(3)), cost-effective (under 50k USD), and maintenance-free. SpinQ Gemini aims to provide real-device experience for quantum computing education for K-12 and at the college level. It also features quantum control design capabilities that benefit the researchers studying quantum control and quantum noise. Since its first launch, SpinQ Gemini has been shipped to institutions in Canada, Taiwan and Mainland China. This paper introduces the system of design of SpinQ Gemini, from hardware to software. We also demonstrate examples for performing quantum computing tasks on SpinQ Gemini, including one task for a variational quantum eigensolver of a two-qubit Heisenberg model. The next generations of SpinQ quantum computing devices will adopt models of more qubits, advanced control functions for researchers with comparable cost, as well as simplified models for much lower cost (under 5k USD) for K-12 education. We believe that low-cost portable quantum computing products will facilitate hands-on experience for teaching quantum computing at all levels, well-prepare younger generations of students and researchers for the future of quantum technologies.

TI Quantum entanglement and extractable work for Gaussian states
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB The study of quantum thermodynamics aims to elucidate the role played by quantum principles in the emergent features of quantum thermodynamic processes. Specifically, it is of fundamental importance to understand how quantum correlation among different parties enables thermodynamic features distinguishable from those arising in classical thermodynamics. In this work, we investigate the relation between extractable work and quantum correlations for two-mode Gaussian states. We examine the change in local energy occurring at one party due to a Gaussian measurement performed on the other in relation to the quantum correlations of two-mode states classified as separable, entangled, and steerable states. Our analysis reveals a clear quantitative difference in the extractable work, depending on the class of states to which the two-mode state belongs.

TI Entanglement-Based Single-Photon Amplification With High Fidelity of

SO IEEE PHOTONICS JOURNAL
AB The amplification protocol of single-photon is an effective method to overcome the photon loss in the practical quantum communication. Here, we propose an entanglement-based single-photon amplification to nearly eliminate the vacuum state resulting from the photon loss. By the quantum nondemolition detection with cross-Kerr nonlinearity, our proposal has more higher fidelity of the polarization feature. And the total success probability of the amplification can be improved with bigger nonlinearity. This absolute amplification of single-photon is of great value to lengthen the quantum communication distance.

TI Entanglement-informed construction of variational quantum circuits
SO QUANTUM SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB The variational quantum eigensolver is a promising tool for simulating ground states of quantum many-body systems on noisy quantum computers. Its effectiveness relies heavily on the ansatz, which must be both hardware-efficient for implementation on noisy hardware and problem-specific to avoid local minima and convergence problems. In this article, we explore entanglement-informed ansatz schemes that naturally emerge from specific models, aiming to balance accuracy with minimal use of two-qubit entangling gates. We investigate three models of quasi-1D Hamiltonians focusing on entanglement barriers and long-range interactions. We find that including the entanglement structure in the parameterized quantum circuit reduces the resources necessary to achieve a given accuracy. A better assessment is obtained by analyzing how the ansatz captures the entanglement spectrum. Our comprehensive analysis provides a new perspective on the design of ans & auml;tze based on the expected entanglement structure of the approximated state.

AB At present, research on the combination of quantum computing and artificial intelligence algorithms applied to the fault location of distribution networks is very sufficient. Because this type of algorithm usually uses the switching function in logical form, it leads to numerical instability and is difficult to expand to the problem of a larger scale distribution network. Therefore, in this study, we propose a hybrid classical quantum computing architecture model for the fusion of quantum annealing and fault location in distribution networks. Firstly, an algebraic objective function suitable for D-wave quantum computer was constructed according to the distributed idea, and the feasibility of the model was verified by using quantum platform. Then, a decoupling optimization model was proposed to improve the poor accuracy of the model in the case of multiple faults, and the decoupling optimization operation was completed by classical calculation and verified experimentally on the quantum platform. Then the original model and decoupled optimization model were applied to fault scenarios of 20-node single power distribution network, 33-node single power distribution network, 9-node distribution network with distributed generation source(DG), 16-node distribution network with DGs, and 33-node distribution network with DGs. The performance of the two models was compared in five aspects: the accuracy of fault location, quantum bit resource consumption, model parameter range, running time and fault tolerance performance. Finally, the quantum classical hybrid decoupling optimization model was compared with the simulated annealing algorithm, the quantum annealing algorithm and the improved quantum annealing algorithm in three aspects of accuracy, running time and quantum bit consumption resources. Both the comparison between the two models constructed in this paper and the comparison between the hybrid model and the classical model can reflect that the decoupled optimization model is committed to realizing the fault location of a larger scale distribution network with fewer quantum bits, and can play the advantages of the classical quantum hybrid architecture model.

TI Two- and three-mode squeezing in a three-qubit entangled system
SO QUANTUM INFORMATION PROCESSING
AB The states of a three-mode bosonic system with the restricted Hilbert space are discussed in the context of quantum entanglement and squeezing of quantum fluctuations. The states exhibiting nonzero tripartite entanglement are considered. Mutual relations between the two- and three-mode entanglement quantified by the corresponding negativities and the squeezing described by the corresponding principal squeeze variances are revealed. Entangled three-qubit states exhibiting squeezing are identified.

TI Compilation of algorithm-specific graph states for quantum circuits
SO QUANTUM SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB We present a quantum circuit compiler that prepares an algorithm-specific graph state from quantum circuits described in high level languages, such as Cirq and Q#. The computation can then be implemented using a series of non-Pauli measurements on this graph state. By compiling the graph state directly instead of starting with a standard lattice cluster state and preparing it over the course of the computation, we are able to better understand the resource costs involved and eliminate wasteful Pauli measurements on the actual quantum device. Access to this algorithm-specific graph state also allows for optimisation over locally equivalent graph states to implement the same quantum circuit. The compiler presented here finds ready application in measurement based quantum computing, NISQ devices and logical level compilation for fault tolerant implementations.

TI Evolutionary Algorithms and Quantum Computing: Recent Advances,
   Opportunities, and Challenges
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB Quantum computers have made significant progress in the last two decades showing great potential in tackling some of the most challenging problems in computing. This ongoing progress creates an opportunity to implement and evaluate quantum-inspired metaheuristics on real quantum devices, with the aim of uncovering potential computational advantages. Additionally, the practical constraints associated with current quantum computers have highlighted a critical need for classical heuristic methods to optimize the tunable parameters of quantum circuits. Nature-inspired metaheuristics have emerged as promising candidates for fulfilling this optimization role. In this paper, we discuss both of these potential directions at the intersection of evolutionary computing and quantum computing while surveying some of the most promising advancements in these directions. We start with the review of quantum-inspired metaheuristics and then explore implementations of some of these quantum-inspired algorithms on physical quantum devices, capitalizing on the progress in quantum computing technology. Furthermore, we investigate the role of nature-inspired metaheuristics in enhancing the performance of noisy intermediate-scale quantum computers by fine-tuning their parameters. Finally, we discuss some of the recent progress at the intersection of both computing frameworks to highlight the current status and potential of the currently available quantum computing hardware. Synergies between these two computing frameworks demonstrate the potential of a strongly symbiotic relation that can contribute to the simultaneous advancements in both of these computing paradigms.

We present two versions of an interactive activity designed for high school students (ages 13 to 18) that introduce a core quantum concept-entanglement. The first version illustrates a simple connection between two particles, and the second explores different ways that two particles could be entangled. This activity works well for entry-level quantum computing learning and requires minimal materials.

TI Quantum Hamiltonian embedding of images for data reuploading classifiers
SO QUANTUM MACHINE INTELLIGENCE
AB When applying quantum computing to machine learning tasks, one of the first considerations is the design of the quantum machine learning model itself. Conventionally, the design of quantum machine learning algorithms relies on the "quantisation" of classical learning algorithms, such as using quantum linear algebra to implement important subroutines of classical algorithms, if not the entire algorithm, seeking to achieve a quantum advantage through possible run-time accelerations brought by quantum computing. However, recent research has started questioning whether quantum advantage via speedup is the right goal for quantum machine learning (Schuld and Killoran 2022 PRX Quantum 3(3):030101.). Research also has been undertaken to exploit properties that are unique to quantum systems, such as quantum contextuality, to better design quantum machine learning models (Bowles et al. 2023). In this paper, we take an alternative approach by incorporating the heuristics and empirical evidences from the design of classical deep learning algorithms to the design of quantum neural networks. We first construct a model based on the data reuploading circuit (P & eacute;rez-Salinas et al. 2020 Quantum 4(226):226) with the quantum Hamiltonian data embedding unitary (Schuld and Petruccione 2021). Through numerical experiments on image datasets, including the famous MNIST and FashionMNIST datasets, we demonstrate that our model outperforms the quantum convolutional neural network (QCNN) (Cong et al. 2019 Nat Phys 15(12):1273-1278) by a large margin (up to over 40% on MNIST test set). Based on the model design process and numerical results, we then laid out six principles for designing quantum machine learning models, especially quantum neural networks.

TI Realizing an Entanglement-Based Multiuser Quantum Network with
   Integrated Photonics
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW APPLIED
AB Quantum networks facilitate the secure transmission of information between different users. Establishing communication links among multiple users in a scalable and efficient way is important for realizing a large-scale quantum network. Here we develop an energy-time entanglement-based dense wavelength division multiplexed network based on an integrated silicon nitride microring resonator, which offers a wide frequency span (covering at least the entire C-band) and narrow bandwidth modes (similar to 650 MHz). Six pairs of photons are selected to form a fully and simultaneously connected four-user quantum net-work. The observed quantum interference visibilities are well above the classical limits among all users. Each pair of users perform the BBM92 protocol for quantum key distribution. Our results pave the way for realizing large-scale quantum networks with integrated photonic architecture.

TI Noise Performance of On-Chip Nano-Mechanical Switches for Quantum
   Photonics Applications
SO ADVANCED QUANTUM TECHNOLOGIES
AB Nano-opto-electromechanical systems provide an elegant solution for controlling light in quantum photonic integrated circuits, enabling small footprint devices for on-chip unitary transformations with low power consumption and cryogenic compatibility. In quantum applications, the noise of optical switches and routers is an important factor in establishing high-fidelity linear optical operations. In this work, the dynamical operation and noise performance of gap-variable directional couplers fabricated in Gallium Arsenide, are reported. The noise contribution stemming from mechanical modes of the devices are investigated and a low-temperature total phase noise of delta phi similar or equal to (4.7 +/- 0.1)mrad is observed over the 1-5 MHz bandwidth. The noise characteristic depends very weakly on the temperature, suggesting that the origin of noise stems primarily from electrostatic actuation.

TI Decoherence of a tunable capacitively shunted flux qubit
SO COMMUNICATIONS PHYSICS
AB Quantum annealing is a method to solve optimization problems that leverages quantum tunneling in a coupled qubit system. We present a detailed study of the coherence of a tunable capacitively-shunted flux qubit, designed for coherent quantum annealing applications. We find that for high qubit frequencies, thermal noise in the bias line makes a significant contribution to the relaxation, arising from the design choice to experimentally explore both fast annealing and high-frequency control. The measured dephasing rate is primarily due to intrinsic low-frequency flux noise in the two qubit loops, with additional contribution from the low-frequency noise of control electronics used for fast annealing. Our results characterize decoherence in a realistic setup for quantum annealing and are relevant for ongoing efforts toward building superconducting quantum annealers with increased coherence.

TI High-Dimensional Remote State Preparation with Metasurface-Based
   Hyper-Entangled Photon Source
SO LASER & PHOTONICS REVIEWS
AB A high-dimensional quantum network with multiple degrees of freedom provides enhanced channel capacity and noise resilience, making it highly significant for quantum communication. However, achieving quantum networks with high-dimensional hyper-entanglements using traditional optical systems presents substantial challenges. In this study, the generation of a compact high-dimensional hyper-entangled photon source utilizing a metasurface is demonstrated. Furthermore, a scalable protocol for the remote preparation of high-dimensional single-photon states, ranging from 3 to 8 dimensions based on this entangled light source is theoretically proposed and experimentally validated. The average fidelities of the remotely prepared states all exceed 0.9. This metasurface-based approach to quantum communication protocols presents a promising avenue for the development of large-scale quantum networks and distributed quantum computing systems.

TI Quantum algorithms for state preparation and data classification based
   on stabilizer codes
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Quantum error correction (QEC) is a way to protect quantum information against noise. It consists of encoding input information into entangled quantum states known as the code space. Furthermore, to classify if the encoded information is corrupted or intact, a step known as syndrome detection is performed. For stabilizer codes, this step consists of measuring a set of stabilizer operators. In this paper, inspired by the QEC approach, and specifically stabilizer codes, we propose a prototype quantum circuit model for classification of classical data. The core quantum circuit can be considered as a quantum perceptron where the classification is based on syndrome detection. In this proposal, a quantum perceptron is realized by one stabilizer as part of a stabilizer code, while a quantum neural network (QNN) layer is realized by a stabilizer code which consists of many stabilizers. The concatenation of stabilizer codes results in complex QNNs. The QNN is trained by performing measurements and optimization of a set of parametrized stabilizers. We demonstrate the concept numerically. In this paper we also consider the first challenge to most applications of quantum computers, including data classification, which is to load data into the memory of the quantum computer. This loading amounts to representing the data as a quantum state, i.e., quantum state preparation. An exact amplitude encoding algorithm requires a circuit of exponential depth. We introduce an alternative recursive algorithm which approximates amplitude encoding with only a polynomial number of elementary gates. We name it the recursive approximate-scheme algorithm.

TI Quantum Optical Convolutional Neural Network: A Novel Image Recognition
   Framework for Quantum Computing
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB Large machine learning models based on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) with rapidly increasing numbers of parameters are being deployed in a wide array of computer vision tasks. However, the insatiable demand for computing resources required to train these models is fast outpacing the advancement of classical computing hardware, and new frameworks including Optical Neural Networks (ONNs) and quantum computing are being explored as future alternatives. In this work, we report a novel quantum computing based deep learning model, the Quantum Optical Convolutional Neural Network (QOCNN), to alleviate the computational bottleneck in future computer vision applications. Using the MNIST dataset, we have benchmarked this new architecture against a traditional CNN model based on the seminal LeNet architecture. We have also compared the performance against previously reported ONNs, the GridNet and ComplexNet, and a Quantum Optical Neural Network (QONN) that we built by combining the ComplexNet with quantum-inspired sinusoidal nonlinearities. Our work extends the prior research on QONN by adding quantum convolution and pooling layers. We have evaluated the models using the metrics of accuracies, confusion matrices, Receiver Operating Characteristic curves, and Matthews Correlation Coefficients. The performance of the models were similar, and the metrics indicated that the new QOCNN model is robust. Finally, we estimated the gains in computational efficiencies from executing this novel framework on a quantum computer, concluding that switching to a quantum computing based approach to deep learning may result in comparable accuracies to classical models while simultaneously achieving unprecedented boosts in computational performances and power allocation.

TI Noisy intermediate-scale quantum algorithm for semidefinite programming
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Semidefinite programs (SDPs) are convex optimization programs with vast applications in control theory, quantum information, combinatorial optimization, and operational research. Noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) algorithms aim to make an efficient use of the current generation of quantum hardware. However, optimizing variational quantum algorithms is a challenge as it is an nondeterministic polynomial time-hard problem that in general requires an exponential time to solve and can contain many far from optimal local minima. Here, we present a current term NISQ algorithm for solving SDPs. The classical optimization pro-gram of our NISQ solver is another SDP over a lower dimensional ansatz space. We harness the SDP-based formulation of the Hamiltonian ground-state problem to design a NISQ eigensolver. Unlike variational quantum eigensolvers, the classical optimization program of our eigensolver is convex and can be solved in polynomial time with the number of ansatz parameters, and every local minimum is a global minimum. We find numeric evidence that NISQ SDP can improve the estimation of ground-state energies in a scalable manner. Further, we efficiently solve constrained problems to calculate the excited states of Hamiltonians, find the lowest energy of symmetry constrained Hamiltonians, and determine the optimal measurements for quantum state discrimination. We demonstrate the potential of our approach by finding the largest eigenvalue of up to 2(1000) dimensional matrices and solving graph problems related to quantum contextuality. We also discuss NISQ algorithms for rank-constrained SDPs. Our work extends the application of NISQ computers onto one of the most successful algorithmic frameworks of the past few decades.

TI Nondemolition fluorescence readout and high-fidelity unconditional reset
   of a fluxonium qubit via dissipation engineering
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Nondemolition readout and high-fidelity unconditional reset of qubits are key requirements for practical quantum computation. For superconducting qubits, readout and reset are typically realized using resonators based on dispersive approximation. However, violations of the approximation often lead to detrimental effects on the qubit. In this work, we demonstrate nondemolition fluorescence readout and high-fidelity unconditional reset of a fluxonium qubit via dissipation engineering without employing a resonator. We design and implement a planar filter to protect the qubit from energy relaxation while enhancing the relaxation of the readout transition. By appropriately selecting the readout transition, we achieve fluorescence readout with enhanced quantum nondemolitionness. We also realize fast, high-fidelity, and all-microwave unconditional reset of the fluxonium qubit. These results highlight the potential of superconducting quantum computing architectures without relying on dispersive interaction between qubits and resonators.

TI Memory and Transduction Prospects for Silicon T Center Devices
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB The T center, a silicon-native spin-photon interface with telecommunication-band optical transitions and long-lived microwave qubits, offers an appealing new platform for both optical quantum memory and microwave-to-optical telecommunication-band transduction. A wide range of quantum memory and transduction schemes could be implemented withT center ensembles with sufficient optical depth, with advantages and disadvantages that depend sensitively on the ensemble properties. In this work we char-acterize T center spin ensembles to inform device design. We perform the first T ensemble optical depth measurement and calculate the improvement in center density or resonant optical enhancement required for efficient optical quantum memory. We further demonstrate a coherent microwave interface by coher-ent population trapping and Autler-Townes splitting. We then determine the most promising microwave and optical quantum memory protocol for such ensembles. By estimating the memory efficiency both in free space and in the presence of a cavity, we show that efficient optical memory is possible with reason-able optical density forecasts. Finally, we formulate a transduction proposal and discuss the achievable efficiency and fidelity.

TI Trapped Ion Quantum Computing Using Optical Tweezers and Electric Fields
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB We propose a new scalable architecture for trapped ion quantum computing that combines optical tweezers delivering qubit state-dependent local potentials with oscillating electric fields. Since the electric field allows for long-range qubit-qubit interactions mediated by the center-of-mass motion of the ion crystal alone, it is inherently scalable to large ion crystals. Furthermore, our proposed scheme does not rely on either ground-state cooling or the Lamb-Dicke approximation. We study the effects of imperfect cooling of the ion crystal, as well as the role of unwanted qubit-motion entanglement, and discuss the prospects of implementing the state-dependent tweezers in the laboratory.

TI 'Sawfish' Photonic Crystal Cavity for Near-Unity Emitter-to-Fiber
   Interfacing in Quantum Network Applications
SO ADVANCED OPTICAL MATERIALS
AB Photon loss is one of the key challenges to overcome in complex photonic quantum applications. Photon collection efficiencies directly impact the amount of resources required for measurement-based quantum computation and communication networks. Promising resources include solid-state quantum light sources. However, efficiently coupling light from a single quantum emitter to a guided mode remains demanding. In this work, photon losses are eliminated by maximizing coupling efficiencies in an emitter-to-fiber interface. A waveguide-integrated 'Sawfish' photonic crystal cavity is developed and finite element (FEM) simulations are employed to demonstrate that such an emitter-to-fiber interface transfers, with 97.4 % efficiency, the zero-phonon line (ZPL) emission of a negatively-charged tin vacancy center in diamond (SnV-) adiabatically to a single-mode fiber. A surrogate model trained by machine learning provides quantitative estimates of sensitivities to fabrication tolerances. The corrugation-based Sawfish design proves robust under state-of-the-art nanofabrication parameters, maintaining an emitter-to-fiber coupling efficiency of 88.6 %. Applying the Sawfish cavity to a recent one-way quantum repeater protocol substantiates its potential in reducing resource requirements in quantum communication.

TI Experimental investigation of quantum correlations under restricted
   distrust in a semi-device-independent framework
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB Semi-device-independent (SDI) methods provide a convenient way to characterizequantum systems under additional physical assumptions, and these methods have wide applicationsin quantum information processing, such as quantum key distribution, quantum random numbergeneration and quantum certification. Recently, Tavakoli proposed an SDI scheme to investigatequantum correlations based on the assumption of restricted distrust. Here, we experimentallyinvestigate quantum correlations in an SDI framework with restricted distrust, where the prepareremits states with a bounded fidelity with respect to a set of target states and the measurer operatesan uncharacterized measurement device. In our work, we experimentally realize quantum statediscrimination with bounded distrust and apply it to the certification of detection efficiency.Moreover, we demonstrate the advantages of quantum systems over classical counterparts evenat substantial degrees of distrust. Finally, we investigate SDI random number generation withrestricted distrust and show that high rates of randomness can also be generated at experimentallyrealistic levels of distrust. Our work opens new avenues for SDI quantum information processing

TI A framework for curriculum transformation in quantum information science
   and technology education
SO EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB The field of Quantum Information Science and Technology (QIST) is booming. Due to this, many new educational courses and university programs are needed in order to prepare a workforce for the developing industry. Owing to its specialist nature, teaching approaches in this field can easily become disconnected from the substantial degree of science education research which aims to support the best approaches to teaching in Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics fields. In order to connect these two communities with a pragmatic and repeatable methodology, we have synthesised this educational research into a decision-tree based theoretical model for the transformation of QIST curricula, intended to provide a didactical perspective for practitioners. The Quantum Curriculum Transformation Framework consists of four steps: (1) choose a topic, (2) choose one or more targeted skills, (3) choose a learning goal and (4) choose a teaching approach that achieves this goal. We show how this can be done using an example curriculum and more specifically quantum teleportation as a basic concept of quantum communication within this curriculum. By approaching curriculum creation and transformation in this way, educational goals and outcomes are more clearly defined which is in the interest of the individual and the industry alike. The framework is intended to structure the narrative of QIST teaching, and with future testing and refinement it will form a basis for further research in the didactics of QIST.

TI Simulating key properties of lithium-ion batteries with a fault-tolerant
   quantum computer
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB There is a pressing need to develop new rechargeable battery technologies that can offer higher energy storage, faster charging, and lower costs. Despite the success of existing methods for the simulation of battery materials, they can sometimes fall short of delivering accurate and reliable results. Quantum computing has been discussed as an avenue to overcome these issues, but only limited work has been done to outline how it may impact battery simulations. In this work, we provide a detailed answer to the following question: how can a quantum computer be used to simulate key properties of a lithium-ion battery? Based on recently introduced first-quantization tech-niques, we lay out an end-to-end quantum algorithm for calculating equilibrium cell voltages, ionic mobility, and thermal stability. These can be obtained from ground-state energies of materials, which are the core calculations executed by the quantum computer using qubitization-based quantum phase estimation. The algorithm includes explicit methods for preparing approximate ground states of periodic materials in first quantization. We bring these insights together to estimate the resources required to implement a quantum algorithm for simulating a realistic cathode material, dilithium iron silicate.

TI On the Utility of Quantum Entanglement for Joint Communication and
   Instantaneous Detection
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON COMMUNICATIONS
AB Entanglement is known to significantly improve the performance (separately) of communication and detection schemes that utilize quantum resources. This work explores the simultaneous utility of quantum entanglement for (joint) communication and detection schemes, over channels that are convex combinations of identity, depolarization and erasure operators, both with perfect and imperfect entanglement assistance. The channel state is binary, rapidly time-varying and unknown to the transmitter. While the communication is delay-tolerant, allowing the use of arbitrarily long codewords to ensure reliable decoding, the channel state detection is required to be instantaneous. The detector is neither co-located with the transmitter, nor able to wait for the decoding in order to learn the transmitted waveform. The results of this work appear in the form of communication-rate vs instantaneous-detection-error tradeoffs, with and without quantum entanglement. Despite the challenges that place the two tasks at odds with each other, the results indicate that quantum entanglement can indeed be simultaneously and significantly beneficial for joint communication and instantaneous detection.

TI Crosstalk analysis in quantum networks: detection and localization
   insights with photon counting OTDR
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB Leveraging pre-existing classical fiber optic infrastructure, particularly optical fibers, and their associated component technologies, is essential for the practical realization of future quantum networks. However, when adapting such infrastructure for quantum communication, optical crosstalk from sub-milliwatt classical-channel power into quantum channels presents a significant challenge in quantum network development, introducing substantial noise that limits the network's performance, scalability, and fidelity. Crosstalk can occur between fibers at multiple points, such as connector interfaces at patch panels, within optical devices due to inadequate optical isolation, and in other fiber-related components. Crosstalk also occurs between channels with different frequencies within a single optical fiber, as Raman scattering converts classical light to photons at frequencies that may interfere with the quantum signal. While Raman scattering in optical fibers has been widely studied, crosstalk occurring between separate fibers at their connection locations, typically at network components such as transparent switches and patch panels, in quantum networks has not received sufficient attention. Here we report a demonstration using photon-counting optical time-domain reflectometry (nu-OTDR) to precisely identify and localize crosstalk between separate channels within the same fiber and between separate fibers. The coexistence of classical and quantum signals in the same network necessitates the use of optical switches for efficient routing and control. Crosstalk characterization of an optical switch reveals a strong dependence on the cross-connect configuration. Higher crosstalk levels were observed in certain specific configurations, while no measurable crosstalk was detected in others. Additionally, we found that crosstalk exhibits a pronounced wavelength dependence, increasing over tenfold at longer wavelengths. These findings demonstrate the value of nu-OTDR in diagnosing and mitigating crosstalk in quantum networks. They highlight the importance of optimizing optical switch configurations and wavelength management to minimize noise, ultimately enhancing the scalability, fidelity, and overall performance of quantum networks. This work establishes a foundational approach to addressing crosstalk, paving the way for more robust and efficient quantum network designs.

AB We propose a quantum programming paradigm where all data are familiar classical data, and the only non-classical element is a random number generator that can return results with negative probability. Currently, the vast majority of quantum programming languages instead work with quantum data types made up of qubits. The description of their behavior relies on heavy linear algebra and many interdependent concepts and intuitions from quantum physics, which takes dedicated study to understand. We demonstrate that the proposed view of quantum programming explains its central concepts and constraints in more accessible, computationally relevant terms. This is achieved by systematically reducing everything to the existence of that negative-probability random generator, avoiding mention of advanced physics. This makes quantum programming more accessible to programmers without a deep background in physics or linear algebra. The bulk of this paper is written with such an audience in mind. As a working vehicle, we lay out a simple quantum programming language under this paradigm, showing that not only can it express all quantum algorithms, it also naturally captures the semantics of measurement without ever mentioning qubits or collapse.

TI Quantum annealing-assisted lattice optimization
SO NPJ COMPUTATIONAL MATERIALS
AB High Entropy Alloys (HEAs) have drawn great interest due to their exceptional properties compared to conventional materials. The configuration of HEA system is considered a key to their superior properties, but exhausting all possible configurations of atom coordinates and species to find the ground energy state is extremely challenging. In this work, we proposed a quantum annealing-assisted lattice optimization (QALO) algorithm, which is an active learning framework that integrates the Field-aware Factorization Machine (FFM) as the surrogate model for lattice energy prediction, Quantum Annealing (QA) as an optimizer and Machine Learning Potential (MLP) for ground truth energy calculation. By applying our algorithm to the NbMoTaW alloy, we reproduced the Nb depletion and W enrichment observed in bulk HEA. We found our optimized HEAs to have superior mechanical properties compared to the randomly generated alloy configurations. Our algorithm highlights the potential of quantum computing in materials design and discovery, laying a foundation for further exploring and optimizing structure-property relationships.

TI On the convex characterisation of the set of unital quantum channels
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICS A-MATHEMATICAL AND THEORETICAL
AB In this paper, we consider the convex structure of the set of unital quantum channels. To do this, we introduce a novel framework to construct and characterise different families of low-rank unital quantum maps. In this framework, unital quantum maps are represented as a set of complex parameters on which we impose a set of constraints. The different families of unital maps are obtained by mapping those parameters into the operator representation of a quantum map. For these families, we also introduce a scalar measuring their distance to the set of mixed-unitary maps. We consider the particular case of qutrit channels which is the smallest set of maps for which the existence of non-unitary extremal maps is known. In this setting, we show how our framework generalises the description of well-known maps such as the antisymmetric Werner-Holevo map but also novel families of qutrit maps.

TI Fast and Robust Geometric Two-Qubit Gates for Superconducting Qubits and
   beyond
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW APPLIED
AB Quantum protocols based on adiabatic evolution are remarkably robust against imperfections of con-trol pulses and system uncertainties. While adiabatic protocols have been successfully implemented for quantum operations such as quantum state transfer and single-qubit gates, their use for geometric two-qubit gates remains a challenge. In this paper, we propose a general scheme to realize robust geometric two-qubit gates in multilevel qubit systems where the interaction between the qubits is mediated by an auxiliary system (such as a bus or coupler). While our scheme utilizes stimulated Raman adiabatic pas-sage (STIRAP), it is substantially simpler than STIRAP-based gates that have been proposed for atomic platforms, requiring fewer control tones and ancillary states, as well as utilizing only a generic dispersive interaction. We also show how our gate can be accelerated using a shortcuts-to-adiabaticity approach, allowing one to achieve a gate that is both fast and relatively robust. We present a comprehensive the-oretical analysis of the performance of our two-qubit gate in parametrically modulated superconducting circuits comprising two fluxonium qubits coupled to an auxiliary system.

AB We present an algorithm to reliably generate various quantum states critical to quantum error correction and universal continuous-variable (CV) quantum computing, such as Schrodinger cat states and Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill (GKP) grid states, out of Gaussian CV cluster states. Our algorithm is based on the Photon-counting-Assisted NodeTeleportation Method (PhANTM), which uses standard Gaussian information processing on the cluster state with only the addition of local photon-number-resolving measurements. We show that PhANTM can apply polynomial gates and embed cat states within the cluster. This method stabilizes cat states against Gaussian noise and perpetuates non-Gaussianity within the cluster. We show that existing protocols for breeding cat states can be embedded into cluster-state processing using PhANTM.

TI Quantum Algorithm for Simulating Single-Molecule Electron Transport
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY LETTERS
AB An accurate description of electron transport at a molecular level requires a precise treatment of quantum effects. These effects play a crucial role in determining the electron transport properties of single molecules, which can be challenging to simulate classically. Here we introduce a quantum algorithm to efficiently calculate electronic current through single-molecule junctions in the weak-coupling regime. We show that a quantum computer programmed to simulate vibronic transitions between different charge states of a molecule can be used to compute electron-transfer rates and electronic current. In the harmonic approximation, the algorithm can be implemented using Gaussian boson sampling devices, which are a near-term platform for photonic quantum computing. We apply the algorithm to simulate the current and conductance of a magnesium porphine molecule. The algorithm provides a means for better understanding the mechanism of electron transport at a molecular level, which paves the way for building practical molecular electronic devices.

In particular, when doped with nitrogen, optically active nitrogen-vacancy centers ( NV), can be induced. The center is an outstanding quantum spin system that enables, under ambient conditions, optical initialization, readout, and coherent microwave control with applications in sensing and quantum information. Under optical and radio frequency excitation, the Zeeman splitting of the degenerate states allows the quantitative measurement of external magnetic fields with high sensitivity. This study provides a pedagogical introduction to the properties of the NV centers as well as a step-by-step process to develop and test a simple magnetic quantum sensor based on color centers with significant potential for the development of highly compact multisensor systems.

TI Quantum memory at an eigenstate phase transition in a weakly chaotic
   model
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB We study a fully connected quantum spin model resonantly coupled to a small environment of noninteracting spins, and investigate how initial state properties are remembered at long times. We find memory of initial state properties, in addition to the total energy, that are not conserved by the dynamics. This memory occurs in the middle of the spectrum where an eigenstate quantum phase transition (ESQPT) occurs as a function of energy. The memory effect at that energy in the spectrum is robust to system-environment coupling until the coupling changes the energy of the ESQPT. This work demonstrates the effect of ESQPT memory as independent of integrability and suggests a wider generality of this mechanism for preventing thermalization at ESQPTs.

TI Fast binomial-code holonomic quantum computation with ultrastrong
   light-matter coupling
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB We propose a protocol for bosonic binomial-code nonadiabatic holonomic quantum computation in a system composed of an artificial atom ultrastrongly coupled to a cavity resonator. In our protocol, the binomial codes, formed by superpositions of Fock states, can greatly save physical resources to correct errors in quantum computation. We apply to the system strong driving fields designed by shortcuts-to-adiabatic methods. This reduces the gate time to tens of nanoseconds. Noise induced by control imperfections can be suppressed by a systematic-error-sensitivity nullification method. As a result, this protocol can rapidly (similar to 35 ns) generate fault-tolerant and high-fidelity (greater than or similar to 98% with experimentally realistic parameters) quantum gates.

AB We suggest a method to improve quantum correlations in cavity magnomechanics, through the use of a coherent feedback loop and magnon squeezing. The entanglement of three bipartition subsystems: photon-phonon, photon-magnon, and phonon-magnon, is significantly improved by the coherent feedback-control method that has been proposed. In addition, we investigate Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen steering under thermal effects in each of the subsystems. We also evaluate the scheme's performance and sensitivity to magnon squeezing. Furthermore, we study the comparison between entanglement and Gaussian quantum discord in both steady and dynamical states.

TI A New Entanglement Measure Based on the Total Concurrence
SO ADVANCED QUANTUM TECHNOLOGIES
AB Quantum entanglement is a crucial resource in quantum information processing, advancing quantum technologies. The greater the uncertainty in subsystems' pure states, the stronger the quantum entanglement between them. From the dual form of q$q$-concurrence (q >= 2$q\ge 2$) we introduce the total concurrence. A bona fide measure of quantum entanglement is introduced, the Cqt$\mathcal {C}<^>{t}_q$-concurrence (q >= 2$q \ge 2$), which is based on the total concurrence. Analytical lower bounds for the Cqt$\mathcal {C}<^>{t}_q$-concurrence are derived. In addition, an analytical expression is derived for the Cqt$\mathcal {C}<^>{t}_q$-concurrence in the cases of isotropic and Werner states. Furthermore, the monogamy relations that the Cqt$\mathcal {C}<^>{t}_q$-concurrence satisfies for qubit systems are examined. Additionally, based on the parameterized alpha$\alpha$-concurrence and its complementary dual, the C alpha t$\mathcal {C}<^>{t}_\alpha$-concurrence (0 <=alpha <= 12)$(0\le \alpha \le \frac{1}{2})$ is also proposed.

TI Four-qubit critical states
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICS A-MATHEMATICAL AND THEORETICAL
AB Verstraete et al (2003 Phys. Rev. A 68 012103) showed that SLOCC invariants provide entanglement monotones. We observe that many highly entangled or useful four-qubit states that appear in prior literature are stationary points of such entanglement measures. This motivates the search for more stationary points. We use the notion of critical points (in the sense of the Kempf-Ness theorem) together with Vinberg theory to reduce the complexity of the problem significantly. We solve the corresponding systems utilizing modern numerical nonlinear algebra methods and reduce the solutions by natural symmetries. This method produces an extended list of four-qubit stationary points, which includes all the critical states in the survey by Enr & iacute;quez et al (2016 J. Phys.: Conf. Ser. 698 012003). To illustrate the potential for application, we discuss the use of these states to generate pure five-qubit and six-qubit quantum error correcting codes by reversing a construction of Rains (1996 IEEE Trans. Inf. Theory 44 1388-94).

TI Optimal Estimation of Quantum Coherence by Bell State Measurement: A
   Case Study
SO ENTROPY
AB Quantum coherence is the most distinguished feature of quantum mechanics. As an important resource, it is widely applied to quantum information technologies, including quantum algorithms, quantum computation, quantum key distribution, and quantum metrology, so it is important to develop tools for efficient estimation of the coherence. Bell state measurement plays an important role in quantum information processing. In particular, it can also, as a two-copy collective measurement, directly measure the quantum coherence of an unknown quantum state in the experiment, and does not need any optimization procedures, feedback, or complex mathematical calculations. In this paper, we analyze the performance of estimating quantum coherence with Bell state measurement for a qubit case from the perspective of semiparametric estimation and single-parameter estimation. The numerical results show that Bell state measurement is the optimal measurement for estimating several frequently-used coherence quantifiers, and it has been demonstrated in the perspective of the quantum limit of semiparametric estimation and Fisher information.

TI Evaluating the Security of a "Blind Quantum Algorithm-centered Medical
   Privacy Data Sharing Model" Using the DHGF Method
SO ACTA SCIENTIARUM-TECHNOLOGY
AB This research addresses the academic challenge of lacking security verification methods for quantum computing models. It innovatively introduces the DHGF comprehensive evaluation method into the quantum security field, successfully overcoming the adaptability bottleneck of traditional evaluation methods in quantum scenarios. The research proposes a cross-verification method between a classical algorithm-based evaluation system and a quantum security model, constructing a methodological framework for cross-validation between classical algorithms and quantum technology. This enables dynamic evaluation of blind quantum computing protocols using the DHGF comprehensive evaluation method. Taking a "Blind Quantum Algorithm-centered Medical Privacy Data Sharing Model" as an example, the research demonstrates the entire process of evaluating the security of a privacy data model built on quantum algorithms and technology using the classical DHGF comprehensive evaluation method. The evaluation process integrates the Delphi method, Analytic Hierarchy Process, Grey System Theory, and Fuzzy Comprehensive Evaluation. The Delphi method is used to determine the evaluation indicator set based on expert opinions; the Analytic Hierarchy Process is employed to determine the weights of the evaluation indicators; and then the evaluation is conducted using the Grey System Theory and Fuzzy Comprehensive Evaluation. This research leverages mature and reliable classical algorithms to validate the security of a model built using quantum algorithms and technologies as its core. This approach establishes a cross-validation system integrating classical and quantum techniques, resulting in a dynamically scalable paradigm for quantum security assessment. This represents a bold extension of classical algorithms into the quantum domain. The comprehensive evaluation score Z from the research results demonstrates the algorithm's ability to accurately and quantitatively describe the dynamic security of the model, providing a novel solution for security analysis of complex and uncertain models and holding significant practical value.

TI Entanglement versus gap, quantum teleportation, and the AKLT model
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICS-CONDENSED MATTER
AB Quantum-mechanical entanglement is notoriously volatile because of its susceptibility to external disturbances. However, entanglement can be stabilized if it is present in the non-degenerate ground state of a gapped, time-independent Hamiltonian. In this paper, we devise a spin-chain Hamiltonian whose ground state contains a Bell pair, with one member of the pair at each end of the chain. We study the Hamiltonian numerically, using full numerical diagonalization and a carefully tailored mean-field theory, to show that it is gapped. Whenever the Hamiltonian is tuned to increase its gap, the fidelity of its Bell pair decreases, manifesting a fundamental contention. The form of the Hamiltonian is motivated by quantum teleportation. Comparing it to the canonical Affleck, Kennedy, Lieb, and Tasaki (AKLT) model, we find that the AKLT model exhibits a sort of 'failed quantum teleportation'.

   UNCERTAINTY AND UNCERTAINTY-INDUCED NONLOCALITY OF TWO NITROGEN-VACANCY
   CENTERS COUPLED BY OPEN TWO NANOCAVITIES
SO FRACTALS-COMPLEX GEOMETRY PATTERNS AND SCALING IN NATURE AND SOCIETY
AB In this paper, we investigate the dynamics of quantum memory-assisted entropic uncertainty, uncertainty-induced nonlocality and log-negativity entanglement of two nitrogen-vacancy centers (NVC). In particular, we are interested in analyzing two nitrogen-vacancy centered qubits coupled with two coherent nanocavities. We consider two different configurations of NVC qubits: when the qubits are prepared initially in separable and maximally entangled states. We demonstrate that coherent nanocavities can be successfully used to generate nonlocality and entanglement in the two NVC qubits while suppressing the associated entropic uncertainty. When the system is considered initially in separable two-NVC qubits, we show that the coupled coherent nanocavities successfully generate nonlocality and entanglement while avoiding the associated entropic uncertainty. The parameter's adjustment determines the degree of entanglement, non-locality generation, and preservation. In comparison, we find entanglement more vulnerable to the decoherence and entropic uncertainty action between the two NVC qubits and nanocavities than the uncertainty-induced nonlocality. Furthermore, the NVC-qubits coupled with two coherent nanocavities promote entanglement's sudden birth and death phenomena. This study contributes to the quantum mechanical protocols requiring the robust practical generation of entanglement and nonlocality as well as the related information preservation for the increased efficiency of quantum devices.

TI Compiling Quantamorphisms for the IBM Q Experience
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON SOFTWARE ENGINEERING
AB Based on the connection between the categorical derivation of classical programs from specifications and a category-theoretic approach to quantum information, this paper contributes to extending the laws of classical program algebra to quantum programming. This aims at building correct-by-construction quantum circuits to be deployed on quantum devices such as those available through the IBM Q Experience. Reversibility is ensured by minimal complements. Such complementation is extended inductively to encompass catamorphisms on lists (vulgo folds), giving rise to the corresponding recursion scheme in reversible computation. The same idea is then applied to the setting of quantum programming, where computation is expressed by unitary transformations. This yields the notion of 'quantamorphism', a structural form of quantum recursion implementing cycles and folds on lists with quantum control flow. By Kleisli correspondence, quantamorphisms can be written as monadic functional programs with quantum parameters. This enables the use of Haskell, a monadic functional programming language, to perform the experimental work. Such calculated quantum programs prepared in Haskell are pushed through Quipper and the Qiskit interface to IBM Q quantum devices. The generated quantum circuits - often quite large - exhibit the predicted behaviour. However, running them on real quantum devices naturally incurs a significant amount of errors. As quantum technology is rapidly evolving, an increase in reliability is likely in the future, allowing for our programs to run more accurately.

SO INTELIGENCIA ARTIFICIAL-IBEROAMERICAL JOURNAL OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE
AB Quantum Computing has been evolving in the last years. Although nowadays quantum algorithms performance has shown superior to their classical counterparts, quantum decoherence and additional auxiliary qubits needed for error tolerance routines have been huge barriers for quantum algorithms efficient use. These restrictions lead us to search for ways to minimize algorithms costs, i.e the number of quantum logical gates and the depth of the circuit. For this, quantum circuit synthesis and quantum circuit optimization techniques are explored. We studied the viability of using Projective Simulation, a reinforcement learning technique, to tackle the problem of quantum circuit synthesis for noise quantum computers with limited number of qubits. The agent had the task of creating quantum circuits up to 5 qubits to generate GHZ states in the IBM Tenerife (IBM QX4) quantum processor. Our simulations demonstrated that the agent had a good performance but its capacity for learning new circuits decreased as the number of qubits increased.

TI Fisher Information in Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum Applications
SO QUANTUM
AB The recent advent of noisy intermediate-scale quantum devices, especially near-term quantum computers, has sparked extensive research efforts concerned with their possible applications. At the forefront of the considered approaches are variational methods that use parametrized quantum circuits. The classical and quantum Fisher information are firmly rooted in the field of quantum sensing and have proven to be versatile tools to study such parametrized quantum systems. Their utility in the study of other applications of noisy intermediate-scale quantum devices, however, has only been discovered recently. Hoping to stimulate more such applications, this article aims to further popularize classical and quantum Fisher information as useful tools for near-term applications beyond quantum sensing. We start with a tutorial that builds an intuitive understanding of classical and quantum Fisher information and outlines how both quantities can be calculated on near-term devices. We also elucidate their relationship and how they are influenced by noise processes. Next, we give an overview of the core results of the quantum sensing literature and proceed to a comprehensive review of recent applications in variational quantum algorithms and quantum machine learning.

TI Tools for Quantum Computing Based on Decision Diagrams
SO ACM TRANSACTIONS ON QUANTUM COMPUTING
AB With quantum computers promising advantages even in the near-term NISQ era, there is a lively community that develops software and toolkits for the design of corresponding quantum circuits. Although the underlying problems are different, expertise from the design automation community, which developed sophisticated design solutions for the conventional realm in the past decades, can help here. In this respect, decision diagrams provide a promising foundation for tackling many design tasks such as simulation, synthesis, and verification of quantum circuits. However, users of the corresponding tools often do not have a proper background or an intuition about how these methods based on decision diagrams work and what their strengths and limits are. In this work, we first review the concepts of how decision diagrams can be employed, e.g., for the simulation and verification of quantum circuits. Afterwards, in an effort to make decision diagrams for quantum computing more accessible, we then present a visualization tool for quantum decision diagrams, which allows users to explore the behavior of decision diagrams in the design tasks mentioned above. Finally, we present decision diagram-based tools for simulation and verification of quantum circuits using the methods discussed above as part of the open-source Munich Quantum Toolkit (MQT)-a set of tools for quantum computing developed at the Technical University of Munich and the Johannes Kepler University Linz and released under the MIT license. More information about the corresponding tools is available at https://github.com/cda- tum/. By this, we provide an introduction of the concepts and tools for potential users who would like to work with them as well as potential developers aiming to extend them.

AB For potential quantum advantage, Variational Quantum Algorithms (VQAs) need high accuracy beyond the capability of today's NISQ devices, and thus will benefit from error mitigation. In this work we are interested in mitigating measurement errors which occur during qubit measurements after circuit execution and tend to be the most error-prone operations, especially detrimental to VQAs. Prior work, JigSaw, has shown that measuring only small subsets of circuit qubits at a time and collecting results across all such 'subset' circuits can reduce measurement errors. Then, running the entire ('global') original circuit and extracting the qubit-qubit measurement correlations can be used in conjunction with the subsets to construct a high-fidelity output distribution of the original circuit. Unfortunately, the execution cost of JigSaw scales polynomially in the number of qubits in the circuit, and when compounded by the number of circuits and iterations in VQAs, the resulting execution cost quickly turns insurmountable.
   To combat this, we propose VarSaw, which improves JigSaw in an application-tailored manner, by identifying considerable redundancy in the JigSaw approach for VQAs: spatial redundancy across subsets from different VQA circuits and temporal redundancy across globals from different VQA iterations. VarSaw then eliminates these forms of redundancy by commuting the subset circuits and selectively executing the global circuits, reducing computational cost (in terms of the number of circuits executed) over naive JigSaw for VQA by 25x on average and up to 1000x, for the same VQA accuracy. Further, it can recover, on average, 45% of the infidelity from measurement errors in the noisy VQA baseline. Finally, it improves fidelity by 55%, on average, over JigSaw for a fixed computational budget. VarSaw can be accessed here: https://github.com/siddharthdangwal/VarSaw

TI Photonic integrated chip enabling orbital angular momentum multiplexing
   for quantum communication
SO NANOPHOTONICS
AB Light carrying orbital angular momentum constitutes an important resource for both classical and quantum information technologies. Its inherently unbounded nature can be exploited to generate high-dimensional quantum states or for channel multiplexing in classical and quantum communication in order to significantly boost the data capacity and the secret key rate, respectively. While the big potentials of light owning orbital angular momentum have been widely ascertained, its technological deployment is still limited by the difficulties deriving from the fabrication of integrated and scalable photonic devices able to generate and manipulate it. Here, we present a photonic integrated chip able to excite orbital angular momentum modes in an 800 m long ring-core fiber, allowing us to perform parallel quantum key distribution using two and three different modes simultaneously. The experiment sets the first steps towards quantum orbital angular momentum division multiplexing enabled by a compact and light-weight silicon chip, and further pushes the development of integrated scalable devices supporting orbital angular momentum modes.

TI Generation of highly-retrievable atom-photon entanglement with a
   millisecond lifetime via a spatially-multiplexed cavity
SO QUANTUM
AB Qubit memory entangled with pho-tonic qubit is the building block for quantum repeaters.Cavity-enhanced spin-wave-photon entanglement with sub -second lifetime has been demonstrated by applying dual control modes onto optical-lattice atoms.However, owing to double-mode retrievals in that experi-ment, retrieval efficiency of spin-wave qubit is about one quarter lower than that for a single spin-wave mode.Here, by coupling cold atoms to two modes of a polarization-interferometer-based cav-ity,we achieve perfectly-enhanced qubit re-trieval in long-lived atom-photon entangle-ment.A write-laser beam is applied onto the cold atoms to create a magnetic-field -insensitive spin-wave qubit entangled with a photonic qubit.The spin-wave qubit is retrieved with a single-mode read-laser beam, and the quarter retrieval-efficiency loss is avoided.Our experimental data shows that zero-delay intrinsic retrieval efficiency is up to 77% and 1/e lifetime 1ms. At 50% retrieval efficiency, the stor-age time reaches 540 mu s, which is 13.5 times longer than the best reported result.

TI Combining matrix product states and noisy quantum computers for quantum
   simulation
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Matrix product states (MPSs) and matrix product operators (MPOs) have been proven to be a powerful tool to study quantum many-body systems but are restricted to moderately entangled states as the number of parameters scales exponentially with the entanglement entropy. While MPSs can efficiently find ground states of one-dimensional systems, their capacities are limited when simulating their dynamics, where the entanglement can increase ballistically with time. On the other hand, quantum devices appear as a natural platform to encode and perform the time evolution of correlated many-body states. However, accessing the regime of long-time dynamics is hampered by quantum noise. In this paper we use the best of worlds: the short-time dynamics is efficiently performed by MPSs, compiled into short-depth quantum circuits, and performed further in time on a quantum computer thanks to efficient MPO-optimized quantum circuits. We quantify the capacities of this hybrid classical-quantum scheme in terms of fidelities taking into account a noise model. We show that using classical knowledge in the form of tensor networks provides a way to better use limited quantum resources and lowers the noise requirements to reach a practical quantum advantage. Finally, we successfully demonstrate our approach with an experimental realization of the technique. Combined with efficient circuit transpilation we simulate a ten-qubit system on an actual quantum device over a longer time scale than low-bond-dimension MPSs and purely quantum Trotter evolution.

TI Switching in quantum networks: an optimization investigation
SO JOURNAL OF OPTICAL COMMUNICATIONS AND NETWORKING
AB Quantum key distribution (QKD) promises information theoretic security. However, the distances over which complete security can be achieved are fundamentally limited in the absence of quantum repeaters. Thus, a key question is how to build a quantum network (QN) given this restriction. One paradigm that has been considered is trusted node (TN) quantum networks where intermediate trusted nodes are used as relays of quantum keys. Another paradigm is to route key channels through intermediate nodes optically, either through wavelength or fiber switching, thus avoiding the use of TNs. In both of these paradigms, a QKD receiver or transmitter at a specific node can be shared between multiple QKD transmitters or receivers at different nodes in order to reduce the overall costs; this sharing can be enabled via an optical switch. In this paper, we investigate the two paradigms for designing QNs. In the TN model we assume the Decoy BB84 protocol, whereas in the non-TN model, we employ twin-field QKD (TF-QKD) due to the increased single hop distances. We present mixed integer linear program models to optimize network design in both of these paradigms and use these to investigate the viability of switching in the network models as a method of sharing devices. We show that sharing of devices can provide cost reduction in QNs up to a certain transmission requirement rate between users in the TN model, while also providing benefits even at significantly higher transmission requirements in the TF-QKD model. The specific value of this rate is dependent on the network graph; however, for mesh topology TN networks this is expected to occur at average key transmission requirements of ${\sim}1000 {-} 5000\;{\rm bits/s}$. We further use the models to investigate the effects of different network parameters, such as cooling costs, switch frequency, and device costs. We show that cooled detectors are useful in large TF-QKD networks, despite higher costs, but are only useful in TN networks when transmission requirements are very high or cooling is cheap. We also investigate how network costs vary with switching frequency and switch loss, showing that compromising for slightly faster switching times and higher loss switches does not significantly increase network costs; thus a significant effort in improving switch loss may not be necessary. Finally, we look at how the benefits of sharing devices change as the cost of devices changes, showing that for any non-negligible device cost, device sharing is always beneficial at low transmission requirements.

TI Cloaking a qubit in a cavity
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Cavity quantum electrodynamics (QED) uses a cavity to engineer the mode structure of the vacuum electromagnetic field such as to enhance the interaction between light and matter. Exploiting these ideas in solid-state systems has lead to circuit QED which has emerged as a valuable tool to explore the rich physics of quantum optics and as a platform for quantum computation. Here we introduce a simple approach to further engineer the light-matter interaction in a driven cavity by controllably decoupling a qubit from the cavity's photon population, effectively cloaking the qubit from the cavity. This is realized by driving the qubit with an external tone tailored to destructively interfere with the cavity field, leaving the qubit to interact with a cavity which appears to be in the vacuum state. Our experiment demonstrates how qubit cloaking can be exploited to cancel the ac-Stark shift and measurement-induced dephasing, and to accelerate qubit readout. In addition to qubit readout, applications of this method include qubit logical operations and the preparation of non-classical cavity states in circuit QED and other cavity-based setups.
   Circuit QED with strongly driven cavities is a powerful framework for quantum technologies, but often undesired effects on the qubit are introduced. Here, by using an external tone tailored to destructively interfere with the cavity field, the authors show how a transmon can be protected from these unwanted effects.

AB Realizing distributed architectures for quantum computing is crucial to scaling up computational power. A key component of such architectures is a scheduler that coordinates operations over a short-range quantum network required to enable the necessary non-local entangling gates between quantum processing units (QPUs). It is desirable to determine schedules of minimum make span, which in the case of networks with constrained resources hinges on their efficient usage. Here we compare and contrast two approaches to solving the make span minimization problem, an approach based on the resource constrained project scheduling (RCPSP) framework, and another based on a greedy heuristic algorithm. The workflow considered is as follows. Firstly, the computational circuit is partitioned and assigned to different QPUs such that the number of nonlocal entangling gates acting across partitions is minimized while the qubit load is nearly uniform on the individual QPUs, which can be accomplished using, e.g., the METIS solver. Secondly, the nonlocal entangling gate requirements with respect to the partitions are identified, and mapped to network operation sequences that deliver the necessary entanglement between the QPUs. Finally, the network operations are scheduled such that the make span is minimized. As illustrative examples, we analyze the implementation of a small instance of the Quantum Fourier Transform algorithm over instances of a simple hub and spoke (star) network architecture comprised of a quantum switch as the hub and QPUs as spokes, each with a finite qubit resource budget. In one instance, our results show the RCPSP approach outperforming the greedy heuristic. In another instance, we find the two performing equally well. Our results thus illustrate the effectiveness of the RCPSP framework, while also underlining the relevance and usefulness of greedy heuristics.

TI Engineering multimode interactions in circuit quantum acoustodynamics
SO NATURE PHYSICS
AB In recent years, important progress has been made towards encoding and processing quantum information in the large Hilbert space of bosonic modes. Mechanical resonators have several practical advantages for this purpose, because they confine many high-quality-factor modes into a small volume and can be easily integrated with different quantum systems. However, it is challenging to create direct interactions between different mechanical modes that can be used to emulate quantum gates. Here we demonstrate an in situ tunable beamsplitter-type interaction between several mechanical modes of a high-overtone bulk acoustic-wave resonator. The engineered interaction is mediated by a parametrically driven superconducting transmon qubit, and we show that it can be tailored to couple pairs or triplets of phononic modes. Furthermore, we use this interaction to demonstrate the Hong-Ou-Mandel effect between phonons. Our results lay the foundations for using phononic systems as quantum memories and platforms for quantum simulations.
   Quantum gates require controlled interactions between different degrees of freedom. A tunable coupling has now been demonstrated between the phonon modes of a mechanical resonator designed for storing and manipulating quantum information.

TI Quantum circuits for discrete graphical models
SO QUANTUM MACHINE INTELLIGENCE
AB Graphical models are useful tools for describing structured high-dimensional probability distributions. The development of efficient algorithms for generating samples thereof remains an active research topic. In this work, we provide a quantum algorithm that enables the generation of unbiased and independent samples from general discrete graphical models. To this end, we identify a coherent embedding of the graphical model based on a repeat-until-success sampling scheme which clearly identifies whether a drawn sample represents the underlying distribution. Furthermore, we show that the success probability for finding a valid sample can be lower bounded with a quantity that depends on the number of maximal cliques and the model parameter norm. Moreover, we rigorously proof that the quantum embedding conserves the key property of graphical models, i.e., factorization over the cliques of the underlying conditional independence structure. The quantum sampling algorithm also allows for maximum likelihood learning as well as maximum a posteriori state approximation for the graphical model. Finally, the proposed quantum method shows potential to realize interesting problems on near-term quantum processors. In fact, illustrative experiments demonstrate that our method can carry out sampling and parameter learning not only with idealized simulations of quantum computers but also on actual quantum hardware solely supported by simple readout error mitigation.

SO TRENDS IN PHARMACOLOGICAL SCIENCES
AB Clinical trials are necessary for assessing the safety and efficacy of treatments. However, trial timelines are severely delayed with minimal success due to a multilenges, lack of efficacy, absence of reliable biomarkers, etc. Each of these factors possesses a unique computational challenge, such as data management, trial simulations, statistical analyses, and trial optimization. Recent advancements in quantum computing offer a promising opportunity to overcome these hurdles. In this opinion we uniquely explore the application of quantum optimization and quantum machine learning (QML) to the design and execution of clinical trials. We examine the current capabilities and limitations of quantum computing and outline its potential to streamline clinical trials.

TI A recurrent Gaussian quantum network for online processing of quantum
   time series
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB Over the last decade, researchers have studied the interplay between quantum computing and classical machine learning algorithms. However, measurements often disturb or destroy quantum states, requiring multiple repetitions of data processing to estimate observable values. In particular, this prevents online (real-time, single-shot) processing of temporal data as measurements are commonly performed during intermediate stages. Recently, it was proposed to sidestep this issue by focusing on tasks with quantum output, eliminating the need for detectors. Inspired by reservoir computers, a model was proposed where only a subset of the internal parameters are trained while keeping the others fixed at random values. Here, we also process quantum time series, but we do so using a Recurrent Gaussian Quantum Network (RGQN) of which all internal interactions can be trained. As expected, this increased flexibility yields higher performance in benchmark tasks. Building on this, we show that the RGQN can tackle two quantum communication tasks, while also removing some hardware restrictions of the currently available methods. First, our approach is more resource efficient to enhance the transmission rate of quantum channels that experience certain memory effects. Second, it can counteract similar memory effects if they are unwanted, a task that could previously only be solved when redundantly encoded input signals could be provided. Finally, we run a small-scale version of the last task on Xanadu's photonic processor Borealis.

TI Provably Secure Symmetric Private Information Retrieval with Quantum
   Cryptography
SO ENTROPY
AB Private information retrieval (PIR) is a database query protocol that provides user privacy in that the user can learn a particular entry of the database of his interest but his query would be hidden from the data centre. Symmetric private information retrieval (SPIR) takes PIR further by additionally offering database privacy, where the user cannot learn any additional entries of the database. Unconditionally secure SPIR solutions with multiple databases are known classically, but are unrealistic because they require long shared secret keys between the parties for secure communication and shared randomness in the protocol. Here, we propose using quantum key distribution (QKD) instead for a practical implementation, which can realise both the secure communication and shared randomness requirements. We prove that QKD maintains the security of the SPIR protocol and that it is also secure against any external eavesdropper. We also show how such a classical-quantum system could be implemented practically, using the example of a two-database SPIR protocol with keys generated by measurement device-independent QKD. Through key rate calculations, we show that such an implementation is feasible at the metropolitan level with current QKD technology.

TI Quantum simulation of gauge theory via orbifold lattice
SO JOURNAL OF HIGH ENERGY PHYSICS
AB We propose a new framework for simulating U(k) Yang-Mills theory on a universal quantum computer. This construction uses the orbifold lattice formulation proposed by Kaplan, Katz, and Unsal, who originally applied it to supersymmetric gauge theories. Our proposed approach yields a novel perspective on quantum simulation of quantum field theories, carrying certain advantages over the usual Kogut-Susskind formulation. We discuss the application of our constructions to computing static properties and real-time dynamics of Yang-Mills theories, from glueball measurements to AdS/CFT, making use of a variety of quantum information techniques including qubitization, quantum signal processing, Jordan-Lee-Preskill bounds, and shadow tomography. The generalizations to certain supersymmetric Yang-Mills theories appear to be straightforward, providing a path towards the quantum simulation of quantum gravity via holographic duality.

SO PHYSICA SCRIPTA
AB Ideal deterministic quantum communication tasks require maximally entangled channels. The reality is that the maximally entangled channel is inevitably degraded to a generally entangled one because of various decoherence mechanisms, seriously deteriorating the performance of quantum communication. In most cases, entanglement purification and distillation are utilized to improve the entanglement and to construct the maximally entangled channel. In this paper, we proposed an alternative scheme to realize deterministic joint remote state preparation using a non-maximally entangled channel. Instead of spending additional entanglement resources in advance for entanglement purification or distillation, only two non-entangled ancillaries are employed in this scheme. Whether the employed quantum channel is a maximally entangled channel or a generally entangled one, remote state preparation would never fail theoretically in this investigation. This protocol provides a feasible way for the construction of practical quantum networks.

TI Upper Bounds on Device-Independent Quantum Key Distribution
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB Quantum key distribution (QKD) is a method that distributes a secret key to a sender and a receiver by the transmission of quantum particles (e.g., photons). Device-independent quantum key distribution (DIQKD) is a version of QKD with a stronger notion of security, in that the sender and receiver base their protocol only on the statistics of input and outputs of their devices as inspired by Bell's theorem. We study the rate at which DIQKD can be carried out for a given bipartite quantum state distributed between the sender and receiver or a quantum channel connecting them. We provide upper bounds on the achievable rate going beyond upper bounds possible for QKD. In particular, we construct states and channels where the QKD rate is significant while the DIQKD rate is negligible. This gap is illustrated for a practical case arising when using standard postprocessing techniques for entangled two-qubit states.

TI Dynamics of qudit gates and effects of spectator modes on optimal
   control pulses
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Qudit gates for high-dimensional quantum computing can be synthesized with high precision using numerical quantum optimal control techniques. Large circuits are broken down into modules and the tailored pulses for each module can be used as primitives for a qudit compiler. Application of the pulses of each module in the presence of extra modes may decrease their effectiveness due to crosstalk. In this paper, we address this problem by simulating qudit dynamics for circuit quantum electrodynamics systems. As a test case, we take pulses for single-qudit SWAP gates optimized in isolation and then apply them in the presence of spectator modes each of which are in Fock states. We provide an experimentally relevant scaling formula that can be used as a bound on the fidelity decay. Our results show that frequency shift from spectator mode populations has to be <0.1% of the qudit's nonlinearity in order for high-fidelity single-qudit gates to be useful in the presence of occupied spectator modes.

TI Stabilizing Wall States to Protect Quantum Information
SO IEEE CONTROL SYSTEMS LETTERS
AB A new approach to the decoupling of quantum information from undesired environmental interactions is proposed, based on the preparation and stabilization of particular "wall" states on the interface between the system of interest and the environment. These states can be selected by minimizing the purity loss of the system of interest or by identifying the dominant interaction couplings. The effectiveness of the method is discussed with numerical simulations for paradigmatic systems and different ways to stabilize the wall state. Some promising features of stabilization via strong Hamiltonian driving are highlighted in the examples.

TI Composite Short-Path Nonadiabatic Holonomic Quantum Gates
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW APPLIED
AB Nonadiabatic holonomic quantum computation (NHQC) has attracted significant attention due to its fast evolution and the geometric nature-induced resilience to local noises. However, its long operation time and complex physical implementation make it hard to surpass the dynamical scheme, and thus hindering its wide application. Here, we present to implement NHQC with the shortest path under some conditions, through the inverse Hamiltonian engineering technique, which posseses higher fidelity and stronger robustness than previous NHQC schemes. Meanwhile, the gate performance in our scheme can be further improved by using the proposed composite dynamical decoupling pulses, which can efficiently improve both the gate fidelity and robustness, making our scheme outperform the optimal dynamical scheme in a certain parameter range. Remarkably, our scheme can be readily implemented with Rydberg atoms, and a simplified implementation of the controlled-not gate in the Rydberg blockade regime can be achieved. Therefore, our scheme represents a promising progress towards future fault-tolerant quantum computation in atomic systems.

TI Asymptotic teleportation scheme bridging between standard and port-based
   teleportation
SO QUANTUM SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB Various modified quantum teleportation schemes are proposed to overcome experimental constraints or to meet specific application requirements for quantum communication. Hence, most schemes are developed and studied with unique methodologies, each with its own inherent challenges. Our research focuses on interconnecting these schemes, which appear to be unrelated to each other, based on the idea that the unique advantages of one scheme can compensate for the limitations of another. In this paper, we introduce an asymptotic teleportation scheme that requires the receiver to complete a classical selection task before performing a quantum correction. This scheme bridges standard teleportation with port-based teleportation through the transformation of joint measurements. Specifically, we categorize and analytically investigate protocols within this scheme for qubit systems. Given that the linear optics teleportation protocol without ancilla qubits is contained in the two non-trivial groups, we provide a novel perspective on its expansion. Furthermore, we discuss the potential application of a protocol from one of these groups as a universal programmable processor and extend these protocols to higher-dimensional systems while maintaining the same properties and potential, providing the analytic form of the joint measurement and its performance. These results thereby propose new avenues for developing a quantum network in higher-dimensional systems.

TI Bell Test of Quantum Entanglement in Attosecond Photoionization
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW X
AB Attosecond physics enables the study of ultrafast coherent electron dynamics in matter upon photoexcitation and photoionization, revealing spectacular effects such as hole migration and coherent Auger dynamics in molecules. In the photoionization scenario, there has been a strong focus on probing the physical manifestations of internal quantum coherence within the individual parent ion and photoelectron systems. However, quantum correlations between these two subsystems emerging from attosecond photoionization events have thus far remained much more elusive. In this work, we design theoretically and model numerically a direct probe of quantum entanglement in attosecond photoionization in the form of a Bell test. We simulate from first principles a Bell test protocol for the case of noble gas atoms photoionized by ultrashort, circularly polarized infrared laser pulses in the strong-field regime predicting robust violation of the Bell inequality. This theoretical result paves the way for the direct observation of entanglement in the context of ultrafast photoionization of many-electron systems. Our work provides a novel perspective on attosecond physics directed toward the detection of quantum correlations between systems born during attosecond photoionization and unraveling the signatures of entanglement in ultrafast coherent molecular dynamics, including in the chemical decomposition pathways of molecular ions.

TI H-QNN: A Hybrid Quantum-Classical Neural Network for Improved Binary
   Image Classification
SO AI
AB Image classification is an important application for deep learning. With the advent of quantum technology, quantum neural networks (QNNs) have become the focus of research. Traditional deep learning-based image classification involves using a convolutional neural network (CNN) to extract features from the image and a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) network to create the decision boundaries. However, quantum circuits with parameters can extract rich features from images and also create complex decision boundaries. This paper proposes a hybrid QNN (H-QNN) model designed for binary image classification that capitalizes on the strengths of quantum computing and classical neural networks. Our H-QNN model uses a compact, two-qubit quantum circuit integrated with a classical convolutional architecture, making it highly efficient for computation on noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices that are currently leading the way in practical quantum computing applications. Our H-QNN model significantly enhances classification accuracy, achieving a 90.1% accuracy rate on binary image datasets. In addition, we have extensively evaluated baseline CNN and our proposed H-QNN models for image retrieval tasks. The obtained quantitative results exhibit the generalization of our H-QNN for downstream image retrieval tasks. Furthermore, our model addresses the issue of overfitting for small datasets, making it a valuable tool for practical applications.

TI Self-healing of multipartite entanglement in optical quantum networks
SO OPTICA
AB Multipartite entanglement serves as an essential resource for constructing quantum networks and makes it possible to realize multi-user quantum information protocols outperforming their classical counterparts. Unfortunately, multipartite entanglement is fragile when distributed in complex environments. Therefore, it is urgent to address the issue of multipartite entanglement decoherence caused by complex environments. Here we demonstrate the self-healing of multipartite continuous-variable (CV) entanglement after an obstruction. In our experiment, the tripartite entanglement destroyed by the obstruction-introduced noise and loss can self-heal after free-space propagation of a certain distance due to the self-healing property of a Bessel-Gaussian (BG) beam. We show that the BG beam provides a more robust mode basis for free-space CV quantum entanglement distribution than the widely used fundamental Gaussian beam under similar conditions. In addition, we also demonstrate the self-healing of five sets of tripartite entanglement and 10 sets of bipartite entanglement in orbital-angular-momentum-multiplexed optical quantum networks. Our results pave the way for constructing obstruction-tolerant high-capacity CV optical quantum networks.

TI Quantum computing perspective for electromagnetic wave propagation in
   cold magnetized plasmas
SO PHYSICS OF PLASMAS
AB Electromagnetic waves are an inherent part of all plasmas-laboratory fusion plasmas or astrophysical plasmas. The conventional methods for studying properties of electromagnetic waves rely on discretization of Maxwell equations suitable for implementing on classical, present day, computers. The traditional methodology is not efficient for quantum computing implementation-a future computational source offering a tantalizing possibility of enormous speed up and a significant reduction in computational cost. This paper addresses two topics relevant to implementing Maxwell equations on a quantum computer. The first is on formulating a quantum Schrodinger representation of Maxwell equations for wave propagation in a cold, inhomogeneous, and magnetized plasma. This representation admits unitary, energy preserving, evolution and conveniently lends itself to appropriate discretization for a quantum computer. Riding on the coattails of these results, the second topic is on developing a sequence of unitary operators which form the basis for a qubit lattice algorithm (QLA). The QLA, suitable for quantum computers, can be implemented and tested on existing classical computers for accuracy as well as scaling of computational time with the number of available processors. In order to illustrate the QLA for Maxwell equations, results are presented from a time evolving, full wave simulation of propagation and scattering of an electromagnetic wave packet by non-dispersive dielectric medium localized in space.

TI Quantum signal processing with the one-dimensional quantum Ising model
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
AB Quantum signal processing (QSP) has emerged as a promising framework to manipulate and determine properties of quantum systems. QSP not only unifies most existing quantum algorithms but also provides tools to discover new ones. Quantum signal processing is applicable to single-qubit or multiqubit systems that can be "qubitized" so one can exploit the SU(2) structure of system evolution within special invariant two-dimensional subspaces. In the context of quantum algorithms, this SU(2) structure is artificially imposed on the system through highly nonlocal evolution operators that are difficult to implement on near -term quantum devices. In this work, we propose QSP protocols for the infinite -dimensional Onsager Lie algebra, which is relevant to the physical dynamics of quantum devices that can simulate the transverse -field Ising model. To this end, we consider QSP sequences in the Heisenberg picture, allowing us to exploit the emergent SU(2) structure in momentum space and "synthesize" QSP sequences for the Onsager algebra. Our results demonstrate a concrete connection between QSP techniques and noisy intermediate scale quantum protocols. We provide examples and applications of our approach in diverse fields ranging from space-time dual quantum circuits and quantum simulation to quantum control.

TI Unparalleled selectivity and electronic structure of heterometallic
   [LnLn′Ln] molecules as 3-qubit quantum gates
SO CHEMICAL SCIENCE
AB Heterometallic lanthanide [LnLn'] coordination complexes that are accessible thermodynamically are very scarce because the metals of this series have very similar chemical behaviour. Trinuclear systems of this category have not been reported. A coordination chemistry scaffold has been shown to produce molecules of type [LnLn'Ln] of high purity, i.e. exhibiting high metal distribution ability, based on their differences in ionic radius. Through a detailed analysis of density functional theory (DFT) based calculations, we discern the energy contributions that lead to the unparalleled chemical selectivity of this molecular system. Some of the previously reported examples are compared here with the newly prepared member of this exotic list, [Er2Pr(LA)(2)(LB)(2)(py)(H2O)(2)](NO3) (1) (H(2)LA and H2LB are two beta-diketone ligands). A magnetic analysis extracted from magnetization and calorimetry determinations identifies the necessary attributes for it to act as an addressable, conditional multiqubit spin-based quantum gate. Complementary ab initio calculations confirm the feasibility of these complexes as composite quantum gates, since they present well-isolated ground states with highly anisotropic and distinct g-tensors. The electronic structure of 1 has also been analyzed by EPR. Pulsed experiments have allowed the establishment of the quantum coherence of the transitions within the relevant spin states, as well as the feasibility of a coherent control of these states via nutation experiments.

TI Noise tolerance via reinforcement: learning a reinforced quantum
   dynamics
SO JOURNAL OF STATISTICAL MECHANICS-THEORY AND EXPERIMENT
AB The performance of quantum simulations heavily depends on the efficiency of noise mitigation techniques and error correction algorithms. Reinforcement has emerged as a powerful strategy to enhance the efficiency of learning and optimization algorithms. In this study, we demonstrate that a reinforced quantum dynamics can exhibit significant robustness against interactions with a noisy environment. We study a quantum annealing process in which reinforcement encourages the system to maintain its current state or follow a noise-free evolution. A learning algorithm is used to derive a concise approximation of these reinforced dynamics, thereby reducing the total evolution time and, consequently, the system's exposure to noisy interactions. This also avoids the complexities associated with implementing quantum feedback in such reinforcement algorithms. The efficacy of our method is demonstrated through numerical simulations of reinforced quantum annealing with one-qubit and two-qubit systems under Pauli noise.

We undertake a comparative analysis of differences and similarities between classical and quantum fair machine learning algorithms, specifying how the unique features of quantum computation alter measures, metrics and remediation strategies when quantum algorithms are subject to fairness constraints. We present the first results in quantum fair machine learning by demonstrating the use of Grover's search algorithm to satisfy statistical parity constraints imposed on quantum algorithms. We provide lower-bounds on iterations needed to achieve such statistical parity within c-tolerance. We extend canonical Lipschitz-conditioned individual fairness criteria to the quantum setting using quantum metrics. We examine the consequences for typical measures of fairness in machine learning context when quantum information processing and quantum data are involved. Finally, we propose open questions and research programmes for this new field of interest to researchers in computer science, ethics and quantum computation.

TI Filtering variational quantum algorithms for combinatorial optimization
SO QUANTUM SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB Current gate-based quantum computers have the potential to provide a computational advantage if algorithms use quantum hardware efficiently. To make combinatorial optimization more efficient, we introduce the filtering variational quantum eigensolver which utilizes filtering operators to achieve faster and more reliable convergence to the optimal solution. Additionally we explore the use of causal cones to reduce the number of qubits required on a quantum computer. Using random weighted MaxCut problems, we numerically analyze our methods and show that they perform better than the original VQE algorithm and the quantum approximate optimization algorithm. We also demonstrate the experimental feasibility of our algorithms on a Quantinuum trapped-ion quantum processor powered by Honeywell.

TI Generating random quantum channels
SO JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICAL PHYSICS
AB Several techniques of generating random quantum channels, which act on the set of d-dimensional quantum states, are investigated. We present three approaches to the problem of sampling of quantum channels and show that they are mathematically equivalent. We discuss under which conditions they give the uniform Lebesgue measure on the convex set of quantum operations and compare their advantages and computational complexity and demonstrate which of them is particularly suitable for numerical investigations. Additional results focus on the spectral gap and other spectral properties of random quantum channels and their invariant states. We compute the mean values of several quantities characterizing a given quantum channel, including its unitarity, the average output purity, and the 2-norm coherence of a channel, averaged over the entire set of the quantum channels with respect to the uniform measure. An ensemble of classical stochastic matrices obtained due to super-decoherence of random quantum stochastic maps is analyzed, and their spectral properties are studied using the Bloch representation of a classical probability vector.

AB With the imminent advent of quantum communications head-on and its landing in what is going to be called the Quantum Internet, it is essential to research different ways of how it could be done in its most efficient way. In this work, we propose a game theory based self-adaptive system that, by accumulating reward, manages to learn how to minimize the latency of packets that are sent in a congested quantum network. To begin with, we study under which circumstances the quantum protocol outperforms its classical equivalent. First, analyzing the minimum number of packets moving through the network as a function of the size of the network necessary for guaranteeing an improvement in the quantum protocol. Then, studying the minimum size of the network based on the number of nodes needed to ensure the aforementioned advantage. Furthermore, taking advantage of the concepts of non-cooperative games and reinforcement learning, a protocol is designed and the behavior of a network with quantum nodes is evaluated. In order to analyze this protocol, different algorithms and scenarios are tested by measuring their efficiency and adaptability. Copyright (c) 2022 The Authors.

TI Democratization of quantum technologies
SO QUANTUM SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB As quantum technologies (QT) advance, their potential impact on and relation with society has been developing into an important issue for exploration. In this paper, we investigate the topic of democratization in the context of QT, particularly quantum computing. The paper contains three main sections. First, we briefly introduce different theories of democracy (participatory, representative, and deliberative) and how the concept of democratization can be formulated with respect to whether democracy is taken as an intrinsic or instrumental value. Second, we give an overview of how the concept of democratization is used in the QT field. Democratization is mainly adopted by companies working on quantum computing and used in a very narrow understanding of the concept. Third, we explore various narratives and counter-narratives concerning democratization in QT. Finally, we explore the general efforts of democratization in QT such as different forms of access, formation of grassroot communities and special interest groups, the emerging culture of manifesto writing, and how these can be located within the different theories of democracy. In conclusion, we argue that although the ongoing efforts in the democratization of QT are necessary steps towards the democratization of this set of emerging technologies, they should not be accepted as sufficient to argue that QT is a democratized field. We argue that more reflexivity and responsiveness regarding the narratives and actions adopted by the actors in the QT field and making the underlying assumptions of ongoing efforts on democratization of QT explicit, can result in a better technology for society.

TI Amplitude estimation via maximum likelihood on noisy quantum computer
SO QUANTUM INFORMATION PROCESSING
AB Recently we find several candidates of quantum algorithms that may be implementable in near-term devices for estimating the amplitude of a given quantum state, which is a core subroutine in various computing tasks such as the Monte Carlo methods. One of those algorithms is based on the maximum likelihood estimate with parallelized quantum circuits. In this paper, we extend this method so that it incorporates the realistic noise effect, and then give an experimental demonstration on a superconducting IBM Quantum device. The maximum likelihood estimator is constructed based on the model assuming the depolarization noise. We then formulate the problem as a two-parameters estimation problem with respect to the target amplitude parameter and the noise parameter. In particular we show that there exist anomalous target values, where the Fisher information matrix becomes degenerate and consequently the estimation error cannot be improved even by increasing the number of amplitude amplifications. The experimental demonstration shows that the proposed maximum likelihood estimator achieves quantum speedup in the number of queries, though the estimation error saturates due to the noise. This saturated value of estimation error is consistent to the theory, which implies the validity of the depolarization noise model and thereby enables us to predict the basic requirement on the hardware components (particularly the gate error) in quantum computers to realize the quantum speedup in the amplitude estimation task.

TI Towards an efficient variational quantum algorithm for solving linear
   equations
SO COMMUNICATIONS IN THEORETICAL PHYSICS
AB Variational quantum algorithms are promising methods with the greatest potential to achieve quantum advantage, widely employed in the era of noisy intermediate-scale quantum computing. This study presents an advanced variational hybrid algorithm (EVQLSE) that leverages both quantum and classical computing paradigms to address the solution of linear equation systems. Initially, an innovative loss function is proposed, drawing inspiration from the similarity measure between two quantum states. This function exhibits a substantial improvement in computational complexity when benchmarked against the variational quantum linear solver. Subsequently, a specialized parameterized quantum circuit structure is presented for small-scale linear systems, which exhibits powerful expressive capabilities. Through rigorous numerical analysis, the expressiveness of this circuit structure is quantitatively assessed using a variational quantum regression algorithm, and it obtained the best score compared to the others. Moreover, the expansion in system size is accompanied by an increase in the number of parameters, placing considerable strain on the training process for the algorithm. To address this challenge, an optimization strategy known as quantum parameter sharing is introduced, which proficiently minimizes parameter volume while adhering to exacting precision standards. Finally, EVQLSE is successfully implemented on a quantum computing platform provided by IBM for the resolution of large-scale problems characterized by a dimensionality of 220.

TI Collective biphoton temporal waveform of photon-pair generated from
   Doppler-broadened atomic ensemble
SO QUANTUM SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB Photonic quantum states generated from atomic ensembles will play important roles in future quantum networks and long-distance quantum communication because their advantages, such as universal identity and narrow spectral bandwidth, are essential for quantum nodes and quantum repeaters based on atomic ensembles. In this study, we report the collectively coherent superposition of biphoton wavefunction emitted from different velocity classes in a Doppler-broadened cascade-type atomic ensemble. We experimentally demonstrate that the three times difference of temporal width of both biphoton temporal waveforms varies dependent on the wavelengths of the signal and idler photons from both 6S1/2-6P3/2-6D5/2 and -8S1/2 transitions of 133Cs, corresponding to the idler and signal wavelengths of 852 nm-917 nm and 852 nm-795 nm, respectively. Our results help understand the characteristics of biphoton sources from a warm atomic ensemble and can be applied to long-distance quantum networks and practical quantum repeaters based on atom-photon interactions.

TI A Quantum Algorithm for the Sub-graph Isomorphism Problem
SO ACM TRANSACTIONS ON QUANTUM COMPUTING
AB We propose a novel variational method for solving the sub-graph isomorphism problem on a gate-based quantum computer. The method relies (1) on a new representation of the adjacency matrices of the underlying graphs, which requires a number of qubits that scales logarithmically with the number of vertices of the graphs; and (2) on a new ansatz that can efficiently probe the permutation space. Simulations are then presented to showcase the approach on graphs up to 16 vertices, whereas, given the logarithmic scaling, the approach could be applied to realistic sub-graph isomorphism problem instances in the medium term.

Based on the characteristics of the coherence of quantum channels and the additivity of independent channels, our framework provides an easier way to certify whether a function is a bona fide coherence measure of quantum channels. Detailed example is given to illustrate the effectiveness and advantages of our framework.

TI Frequency-bin-encoded entanglement-based quantum key distribution in a
   reconfigurable frequency-multiplexed network
SO LIGHT-SCIENCE & APPLICATIONS
AB Large-scale quantum networks require dynamic and resource-efficient solutions to reduce system complexity with maintained security and performance to support growing number of users over large distances. Current encoding schemes including time-bin, polarization, and orbital angular momentum, suffer from the lack of reconfigurability and thus scalability issues. Here, we demonstrate the first-time implementation of frequency-bin-encoded entanglement-based quantum key distribution and a reconfigurable distribution of entanglement using frequency-bin encoding. Specifically, we demonstrate a novel scalable frequency-bin basis analyzer module that allows for a passive random basis selection as a crucial step in quantum protocols, and importantly equips each user with a single detector rather than four detectors. This minimizes massively the resource overhead, reduces the dark count contribution, vulnerability to detector side-channel attacks, and the detector imbalance, hence providing an enhanced security. Our approach offers an adaptive frequency-multiplexing capability to increase the number of channels without hardware overhead, enabling increased secret key rate and reconfigurable multi-user operations. In perspective, our approach enables dynamic resource-minimized quantum key distribution among multiple users across diverse network topologies, and facilitates scalability to large-scale quantum networks.

TI Quantum-state engineering in cavity magnomechanics formed by
   two-dimensional magnetic materials
SO NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB Cavity magnomechanics has become an ideal platform to explore macroscopic quantum effects. Bringing together magnons, phonons, and photons in a system, it opens many opportunities for quantum technologies. It was conventionally realized by an yttrium iron garnet, which exhibits a parametric magnon-phonon coupling m dagger m(b dagger+b) , with m and b being the magnon and phonon modes. Inspired by the recent realization of two-dimensional (2D) magnets, we propose a cavity magnomechanical system using a 2D magnetic material with both optical and magnetic drivings. It features the coexisting photon-phonon radiation-pressure coupling and quadratic magnon-phonon coupling m dagger m(b dagger+b)2 induced by the magnetostrictive interaction. A stable squeezing of the phonon and bi- and tri-partite entanglements among the three modes are generated in the regimes with a suppressed phonon number. Compared with previous schemes, ours does not require any extra nonlinear interaction and reservoir engineering and is robust against the thermal fluctuation. Enriching the realization of cavity magnomechanics, our system exhibits its superiority in quantum-state engineering due to the versatile interactions enabled by its 2D feature.

TI Machine Learning to Simulate Quantum Computing System Errors from

SO UNIVERSE
AB In the context of quantum computing, error correction remains a pivotal challenge, primarily due to imperfect gate operations and environmental interactions. This study introduces a machine learning-based method to simulate and analyze these errors. Utilizing a minimal scalable 2-Majorana-zero-mode (2-MZM) island model within a one-dimensional p-wave topological superconductor, this research employs a detailed Hamiltonian approach combined with a bosonic thermal bath interaction. The analysis is conducted using the Pauli master equation and Monte Carlo simulations. This work's novel contribution lies in applying Boosted Decision Tree with Gradient boosting (BDTG) and Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) machine learning techniques. These methods, trained on Monte Carlo simulation data, showed proficiency in predicting the evolution of error probabilities in the quantum system. The results indicate a significant potential for machine learning to offer a more efficient alternative for simulating quantum computing errors, thereby contributing to developing more robust quantum computing systems.

TI Quantum AI for psychiatric diagnosis: enhancing dementia classification
   with quantum machine learning
SO FRONTIERS IN PSYCHIATRY
AB Early detection of dementia is a key requirement for effective patient management. Therefore, classification of dementia is pertinent and requires a highly accurate methodology. Deep learning (DL) models process immense amounts of input data, whereas quantum machine learning (QML) models use qubits and quantum operations to enhance computational speed and data storage through algorithms. QML is a research domain that investigates the interactions between quantum computing concepts and machine learning. A quantum computer reduces training time and uses qubits that play a vital role in learning complex imaging patterns, unlike convolutional kernels. The proposed study focused on imaging data and QML because they are more efficient and accurate than ML/DL for practical applications. Therefore, a hybrid quantum-classical convolutional neural network (QCNN) is proposed that integrates both quantum and classical learning paradigms. In the proposed framework, MRI images are pre-processed through resizing and normalization, followed by the extraction of a region of interest (ROI) from the center of each image. Within the ROI, a 2x2 patch is passed to a quantum circuit, where pixel values are encoded as qubits using rotation gates (RY). A parameterized quantum circuit (PQC) with entangling layers computes expectation values to generate a quantum feature map, which is then utilized as input to the classical CNN. To further improve generalization, a knowledge distillation (KD) framework is employed, where a teacher model (a deeper CNN with high representational capacity) guides a student model (the QCNN), transferring soft-label information via a temperature-scaled softmax. This setup enables the student model to learn more discriminative features while maintaining efficiency. Comprehensive experiments are conducted on benchmark ADNI-1, ADNI-2, and OASIS-2 MRI datasets, and results are reported both with and without KD. Without KD, the QCNN achieves strong performance with accuracies of 0.9523 (ADNI-1), 0.9611 (ADNI-2), and 0.9412 (OASIS-2). With KD, the student model demonstrates enhanced sensitivity to challenging classes, achieving an accuracy of up to 0.9978, surpassing state-of-the-art approaches. Combining quantum feature extraction with teacher-student knowledge transfer yields a scalable and highly accurate framework for dementia classification in clinical practice.

TI Quantum state preparation using tensor networks
SO QUANTUM SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB Quantum state preparation is a vital routine in many quantum algorithms, including solution of linear systems of equations, Monte Carlo simulations, quantum sampling, and machine learning. However, to date, there is no established framework of encoding classical data into gate-based quantum devices. In this work, we propose a method for the encoding of vectors obtained by sampling analytical functions into quantum circuits that features polynomial runtime with respect to the number of qubits and provides >99.9% accuracy, which is better than a state-of-the-art two-qubit gate fidelity. We employ hardware-efficient variational quantum circuits, which are simulated using tensor networks, and matrix product state representation of vectors. In order to tune variational gates, we utilize Riemannian optimization incorporating auto-gradient calculation. Besides, we propose a cut once, measure twice' method, which allows us to avoid barren plateaus during gates' update, benchmarking it up to 100-qubit circuits. Remarkably, any vectors that feature low-rank structure-not limited by analytical functions-can be encoded using the presented approach. Our method can be easily implemented on modern quantum hardware, and facilitates the use of the hybrid-quantum computing architectures.

TI Rapid Quantum Squeezing by Jumping the Harmonic Oscillator Frequency
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB Quantum sensing and quantum information processing use quantum advantages such as squeezed states that encode a quantity of interest with higher precision and generate quantum correlations to outperform classical methods. In harmonic oscillators, the rate of generating squeezing is set by a quantum speed limit. Therefore, the degree to which a quantum advantage can be used in practice is limited by the time needed to create the state relative to the rate of unavoidable decoherence. Alternatively, a sudden change of harmonic oscillator's frequency projects a ground state into a squeezed state which can circumvent the time constraint. Here, we create squeezed states of atomic motion by sudden changes of the harmonic oscillation frequency of atoms in an optical lattice. Building on this protocol, we demonstrate rapid quantum amplification of a displacement operator that could be used for detecting motion. Our results can speed up quantum gates and enable quantum sensing and quantum information processing in noisy environments.

TI The controlled SWAP test for entanglement of mixed quantum states
SO EPL
AB Quantum entanglement plays a key role in the field of quantum computing and quantum communication. The controlled SWAP test has been used to detect pure state entanglement (FoULDS S. et al., Quantum Sci. Technol., 6 (2021) 035002; BECKEY J. L. et al., Phys. Rev. Lett., 127 (2021) 140501). In this paper, we investigate that quantum circuits for controlled SWAP test can be used to detect the entanglement of multipartite mixed state. Based on the measured probability, we propose entanglement criteria for detecting multipartite entanglement and genuine entanglement of pure states. In addition, we give representation of the entanglement measures based on the measured probability of the controlled SWAP tests. Numerical examples are used to illustrate the efficiency of the entanglement criteria.

TI Time-dependent Rabi frequencies to protect quantum operations on an
   atomic qutrit by continuous dynamical decoupling
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB We investigate the form required for the time-dependent Rabi frequencies involved in a procedure capable to protect the action of quantum gates on an atomic qutrit by means of external fields continuously decoupling the system from the environmental noise. Several simulations are considered to protect the action of quantum-gate models, including randomly chosen ones. We argue that the requirements for the Rabi frequencies could be nowadays experimentally met. We also investigate the transition from one gate operation to another, including protecting a qutrit memory state. We finally apply our methodology to protect from noise the application of an algorithm capable of distinguishing the parity of permutations of three elements.

TI Bias in Error-Corrected Quantum Sensing
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB The sensitivity afforded by quantum sensors is limited by decoherence. Quantum error correction (QEC) can enhance sensitivity by suppressing decoherence, but it has a side effect: it biases a sensor's output in realistic settings. If unaccounted for, this bias can systematically reduce a sensor's performance in experiment, and also give misleading values for the minimum detectable signal in theory. We analyze this effect in the experimentally motivated setting of continuous-time QEC, showing both how one can remedy it, and how incorrect results can arise when one does not.

TI TEQUILA: a platform for rapid development of quantum algorithms
SO QUANTUM SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB Variational quantum algorithms are currently the most promising class of algorithms for deployment on near-term quantum computers. In contrast to classical algorithms, there are almost no standardized methods in quantum algorithmic development yet, and the field continues to evolve rapidly. As in classical computing, heuristics play a crucial role in the development of new quantum algorithms, resulting in a high demand for flexible and reliable ways to implement, test, and share new ideas. Inspired by this demand, we introduce tequila, a development package for quantum algorithms in python, designed for fast and flexible implementation, prototyping and deployment of novel quantum algorithms in electronic structure and other fields. tequila operates with abstract expectation values which can be combined, transformed, differentiated, and optimized. On evaluation, the abstract data structures are compiled to run on state of the art quantum simulators or interfaces.

TI Semantics for Variational Quantum Programming
SO PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACM ON PROGRAMMING LANGUAGES-PACMPL
AB We consider a programming language that can manipulate both classical and quantum information. Our language is type-safe and designed for variational quantum programming, which is a hybrid classical-quantum computational paradigm. The classical subsystem of the language is the Probabilistic FixPoint Calculus (PFPC), which is a lambda calculus with mixed-variance recursive types, term recursion and probabilistic choice. The quantum subsystem is a first-order linear type system that can manipulate quantum information. The two subsystems are related by mixed classical/quantum terms that specify how classical probabilistic effects are induced by quantum measurements, and conversely, how classical (probabilistic) programs can influence the quantum dynamics. We also describe a sound and computationally adequate denotational semantics for the language. Classical probabilistic effects are interpreted using a recently-described commutative probabilistic monad on DCPO. Quantum effects and resources are interpreted in a category of von Neumann algebras that we show is enriched over (continuous) domains. This strong sense of enrichment allows us to develop novel semantic methods that we use to interpret the relationship between the quantum and classical probabilistic effects. By doing so we provide a very detailed denotational analysis that relates domain-theoretic models of classical probabilistic programming to models of quantum programming.

TI Is quantum computing green? An estimate for an energy-efficiency quantum
   advantage
SO QUANTUM SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB The quantum advantage threshold determines when a quantum processing unit (QPU) is more efficient with respect to classical computing hardware in terms of algorithmic complexity. The "green' quantum advantage threshold-based on a comparison of energetic efficiency between the two-is going to play a fundamental role in the comparison between quantum and classical hardware. Indeed, its characterization would enable better decisions on energy-saving strategies, e.g. for distributing the workload in hybrid quantum-classical algorithms. Here, we show that the green quantum advantage threshold crucially depends on (a) the quality of the experimental quantum gates and (b) the entanglement generated in the QPU. Indeed, for noisy intermediate-scale quantum hardware and algorithms requiring a moderate amount of entanglement, a classical tensor network emulation can be more energy-efficient at equal final state fidelity than quantum computation. We compute the green quantum advantage threshold for a few paradigmatic examples in terms of algorithms and hardware platforms, and identify algorithms with a power-law decay of singular values of bipartitions-with power-law exponent alpha less than or similar to 1-as the green quantum advantage threshold in the near future.

TI Quantum Codes: A Comprehensive Survey of Techniques, Challenges, and
   Future Directions
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB Quantum error correction is fundamental to enabling reliable quantum computation and communication in the presence of noise and decoherence. Over the years, a diverse range of quantum coding strategies has been developed, each offering distinct approaches to mitigate quantum errors and achieve fault tolerance. This paper presents a comprehensive survey of major quantum code families, including stabilizer codes, topological codes, quantum LDPC codes, convolutional codes, turbo codes, Reed-Muller codes, continuous-variable bosonic codes, and subsystem codes. For each class, we discuss their construction principles, operational strategies, advantages, and inherent limitations. In addition to reviewing existing methodologies, we compare different coding techniques through structured tables and highlight the practical challenges that persist, such as resource overhead, decoding complexity, and scalability. Furthermore, we identify future research directions aimed at overcoming these challenges, including hybrid error correction approaches, machine learning-assisted decoders, and fault-tolerant architectures without magic state distillation. By consolidating the landscape of quantum error correction research, this work aims to serve as a foundational reference for researchers and practitioners working toward scalable, robust quantum technologies.

TI A high-performance compilation strategy for multiplexing quantum control
   architecture
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB Quantum computers have already shown significant potential to solve specific problems more efficiently than conventional supercomputers. A major challenge towards noisy intermediate-scale quantum computing is characterizing and reducing the various control costs. Quantum programming describes the process of quantum computation as a sequence, whose elements are selected from a finite set of universal quantum gates. Quantum compilation translates quantum programs to ordered pulses to the quantum control devices subsequently and quantum compilation optimization provides a high-level solution to reduce the control cost efficiently. Here, we propose a high-performance compilation strategy for multiplexing quantum control architecture. For representative benchmarks, the utilization efficiency of control devices increased by 49.44% on average in our work, with an acceptable circuit depth expansion executing on several real superconducting quantum computers of IBM.

TI Robustness and measurement-induced percolation of the surface code
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICS A-MATHEMATICAL AND THEORETICAL
AB We examine the robustness of a logical qubit in the planar surface code subject to 'measurement-errors', i.e. to local Pauli measurements at known positions. This yields a measurement-only dynamics, which is driven by the competition between local Pauli measurements and stabilizer measurements. The setup differs from the conventional surface code for which errors are caused by decoherence and their positions are unknown. Yet, our setting allows us to examine the dynamics of the encoded logical qubit by using a combination of analytical arguments based on percolation theory and numerical simulations. Firstly, we show that for a single round of Pauli measurements only, the threshold corresponding to the irreversible loss of the logical qubit depends only on the rate of X<^>- and Z<^>-measurements, and that this loss of logical quantum information is equivalent to the bond percolation transition in a 2D square lattice. Local Y<^>-measurements, which affect both X and Z stabilizers, erase the logical qubit only if all physical qubits along one of the diagonals are measured, and are thus negligible at large code distance. Secondly, we examine the dynamics in the code by considering the interplay between rounds of Pauli measurements and rounds of stabilizer measurements. Focusing on the lifetime of the logical qubit, we obtain a rich phase diagram featuring different dynamical regimes. We argue that the loss of the logical qubit in this setting can still be understood by percolation theory and underpin our arguments with numerical simulations.

TI XYZ Ruby Code: Making a Case for a Three-Colored Graphical Calculus for
   Quantum Error Correction in Spacetime
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB Analyzing and developing new quantum error-correcting (QEC) schemes is one of the most prominent tasks in quantum computing research. In such efforts, introducing time dynamics explicitly in both analysis and design of error-correcting protocols constitutes an important cornerstone. In this work, we present a graphical formalism based on tensor networks to capture the logical action and error-correcting capabilities of any Clifford circuit with Pauli measurements. We showcase the functioning of the formalism on new Floquet codes derived from topological subsystem codes, which we call XYZ ruby codes. Based on the projective symmetries of the building blocks of the tensor network we develop a framework of Pauli flows. Pauli flows allow for a graphical understanding of all quantities entering an error-correction analysis of a circuit, including different types of QEC experiments, such as memory and stability experiments. We lay out how to derive a well-defined decoding problem from the tensor-network representation of a protocol and its Pauli flows alone, independent of any stabilizer code or fixed circuit. Importantly, this framework applies to all Clifford protocols and encompasses both measurement-based and circuit-based approaches to fault tolerance. We apply our method to our new family of dynamical codes, which are in the same topological phase as the 2 + 1-dimensional color code, making them a promising candidate for low-overhead logical gates. In contrast to its static counterpart, the dynamical protocol applies a Z3 automorphism to the logical Pauli group every three time steps. We highlight some of its topological properties and comment on the anyon physics behind a planar layout. Lastly, we benchmark the performance of the XYZ ruby code on a torus by performing both memory and stability experiments and find competitive circuit-level noise thresholds of approximately equal to 0.18%, comparable with other Floquet codes and 2 + 1-dimensional color codes.

TI Nonclassical features of an open qubit cavity QED system
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB We investigate the dynamics of quantum correlations and measurement uncertainty in a two-qubit system coupled to a cavity-QED system, characterized by various parameters such as qubit and cavity frequencies under resonant and off-resonant conditions, with equal and unequal coupling strengths. We emphasize asymmetric qubit relaxation and dephasing mechanisms, accompanied by cavity decay. In certain scenarios, separable initial states can outperform entangled states in maintaining quantum correlations over longer periods. We further uncover a trade-off between quantum correlations, measurement uncertainty, and mutual information. Additionally, we demonstrate that asymmetries in coupling strengths or qubit frequencies can enhance quantum correlations and induce irregular oscillations, suggesting new strategies for engineering robust quantum resources in open quantum systems. In comparison, we find that qubit relaxation leads to less decay than qubit dephasing. In contrast, quantum correlations are preserved much longer with appropriate tuning of the cavity decay rate. Finally, the concept of quantum speed limit is employed to assess the resourcefulness of our configuration.

TI Quantum Cryptography-as-a-Service for Secure UAV Communication:
   Applications, Challenges, and Case Study
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB The sudden demand rises in security made researchers come up with solutions that provide instantaneous safety better than the state of the art solutions. The quest for securing data began in the Spartan era. People are now looking to expand this field of research by attacking the existing paradigms and inventing new algorithms that prove to be better than their vulnerable counterparts. Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are very much prevailing due to their sleek design and flexible mobility in many sectors such as agriculture, army, healthcare, monitoring and surveillance, and many more. We discuss the growth and demand of drone technology along with its importance in this article. The paper also throws some light on the ongoing security issues in real-time scenarios and the role of quantum cryptography in securing the information over the traditional solutions. Motivated by this, we present a survey on quantum cryptography's importance, role, and benefits in securing UAV communications underlying beyond 5G networks. A novel quantum cryptography-based layered architectural solution is also proposed to achieve high data security and efficient transmission. This paper also present a case study on the battlefield application on the Internet of military things. The performance of the proposed case study system is evaluated by considering the latency, security, and reliability.

TI Can Quantum Correlations Lead to Violation of the Second Law of
   Thermodynamics?
SO ENTROPY
AB Quantum entanglement can cause the efficiency of a heat engine to be greater than the efficiency of the Carnot cycle. However, this does not mean a violation of the second law of thermodynamics, since there is no local equilibrium for pure quantum states, and, in the absence of local equilibrium, thermodynamics cannot be formulated correctly. Von Neumann entropy is not a thermodynamic quantity, although it can characterize the ordering of a system. In the case of the entanglement of the particles of the system with the environment, the concept of an isolated system should be refined. In any case, quantum correlations cannot lead to a violation of the second law of thermodynamics in any of its formulations. This article is devoted to a technical discussion of the expected results on the role of quantum entanglement in thermodynamics.

TI Frequency-multiplexed Hong-Ou-Mandel interference
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB The implementation of quantum repeaters needed for long-distance quantum communication requires the generation of quantum entanglement distributed among the elementary links. These entanglements must be swapped among the quantum repeaters through Bell-state measurements. This study aims to improve the entanglement generation rate by frequency multiplexing the Bell-state measurements. As a preliminary step of the frequency-multiplexed Bell-state measurements, three frequency modes are mapped to a temporal mode by an atomic frequency comb prepared in Pr3+ ion-doped Y2SiO5 crystals using a weak coherent state, and Hong-Ou-Mandel interference, which is a measure of the indistinguishability of two inputs, is observed in each frequency mode by coincidence detection. The visibility for all the modes was 40%-42% (theoretically up to 50%). Furthermore, we show that a mixture of different modes is avoided. The present results are connected to frequency-selective Bell-state measurements and therefore frequency-multiplexed quantum repeaters.

TI Designing High-Performance Identity-Based Quantum Signature Protocol
   With Strong Security
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB Due to the rapid advancement of quantum computers, there has been a furious race for quantum technologies in academia and industry. Quantum cryptography is an important tool for achieving security services during quantum communication. Designated verifier signature, a variant of quantum cryptography, is very useful in applications like the Internet of Things (IoT) and auctions. An identity-based quantum-designated verifier signature (QDVS) scheme is suggested in this work. Our protocol features security attributes like eavesdropping, non-repudiation, designated verification, and hiding sources attacks. Additionally, it is protected from attacks on forgery, inter-resending, and impersonation. The proposed scheme benefits from the traditional designated verifier signature schemes. In the proposed scheme, the signer encrypts a message with his or her private key, and the designated verifier validates the accompanying QDVS using the signer's public key, which is the signer's name or email address, which makes the quantum signature system's key management simpler. It uses an entangled state while signing and verifying the signature; however, the verifier is not required to compare quantum states. A detailed comparison analysis with other similar schemes provides more security for the proposed scheme. Furthermore, the proposed scheme's effectiveness and feasibility are validated using quantum simulations.

TI Students' view of Quantum Information Technologies, part 2
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ELECTRONICS AND TELECOMMUNICATIONS
AB The aim of the paper is to show how graduated engineering students in classical ICT view practically the advent of the QIT. The students do their theses in El.Eng. and ICT and were asked how to implement now or in the future the QIT in their current or future work. Most of them have strictly defined research topics and in some cases the realization stage is advanced. Thus, most of the potential QIT application areas are defined and quite narrow. In such a case, the issue to be considered is the incorporation of QIT components and interfaces into the existing ICT infrastructure, software and hardware alike, and propose a solution as a reasonable functional hybrid system. The QIT components or circuits are not standalone in most cases, they should be somehow incorporated into existing environment, with a measurable added value. Not an easy task indeed. We have to excuse the students if the proposed solutions are not ripe enough. The exercise was proposed as an on -purpose publication workshop, related strictly to the fast and fascinating development of the QIT. The paper is a continuation of publishing exercises with previous groups of students participating in QIT lectures.

TI Protocols for estimating multiple functions with quantum sensor
   networks: Geometry and performance
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB We consider the problem of estimating multiple analytic functions of a set of local parameters via qubit sensors in a quantum sensor network. To address this problem, we highlight a generalization of the sensor symmetric performance bounds of Rubio et al., [J. Phys. A 53, 344001 (2020)] and develop an optimized sequential protocol for measuring such functions. We compare the performance of both approaches to one another and to local protocols that do not utilize quantum entanglement, emphasizing the geometric significance of the coefficient vectors of the measured functions in determining the best choice of measurement protocol. We show that, in many cases, especially for a large number of sensors, the optimized sequential protocol results in more accurate measurements than the other strategies. In addition, in contrast to the sensor symmetric approach, the sequential protocol is known to always be explicitly implementable. The sequential protocol is very general and has a wide range of metrological applications.

TI Computable and Operationally Meaningful Multipartite Entanglement
   Measures
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB Multipartite entanglement is an essential resource for quantum communication, quantum computing, quantum sensing, and quantum networks. The utility of a quantum state vertical bar psi > for these applications is often directly related to the degree or type of entanglement present in vertical bar psi >. Therefore, efficiently quantifying and characterizing multipartite entanglement is of paramount importance. In this work, we introduce a family of multipartite entanglement measures, called concentratable entanglements. Several well-known entanglement measures are recovered as special cases of our family of measures, and hence we provide a general framework for quantifying multipartite entanglement. We prove that the entire family does not increase, on average, under local operations and classical communications. We also provide an operational meaning for these measures in terms of probabilistic concentration of entanglement into Bell pairs. Finally, we show that these quantities can be efficiently estimated on a quantum computer by implementing a parallelized SWAP test, opening up a research direction for measuring multipartite entanglement on quantum devices.

TI Transformation of a class of pure multipartite entangled states
SO RESULTS IN PHYSICS
AB Entanglement transformation can give insight into quantum entanglement and provide desired resources for quantum information processing. However, the complexity for analyzing entanglement transformation exponentially grows with the increased particle numbers. We find that a sort of multipartite entangled states can be described by the Valence -bond state (VBS) picture and can be decomposed into a series of cells. Thus the study of multipartite entanglement can be greatly simplified. We propose an inverse entanglement resource searching method by which one can find states that can be transformed into desired entangled resource states via local operations and classical communication (LOCC) and stochastic LOCC (SLOCC). In the case of bipartite entanglement, our method includes Nielsen's majorization theorem as a special case. We apply the method to measurement based quantum computation (MBQC) and find some resource states for MBQC that can be transformed into Cluster states via LOCC or SLOCC. We also construct the Hamiltonians of two -body nearest neighbor interactions with the found resource states as their eigenstates.

TI A quantum convolutional neural network on NISQ devices
SO AAPPS BULLETIN
AB Quantum machine learning is one of the most promising applications of quantum computing in the noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) era. We propose a quantum convolutional neural network(QCNN) inspired by convolutional neural networks (CNN), which greatly reduces the computing complexity compared with its classical counterparts, with O((log2M)6) basic gates and O(m2+e) variational parameters, where M is the input data size, m is the filter mask size, and e is the number of parameters in a Hamiltonian. Our model is robust to certain noise for image recognition tasks and the parameters are independent on the input sizes, making it friendly to near-term quantum devices. We demonstrate QCNN with two explicit examples. First, QCNN is applied to image processing, and numerical simulation of three types of spatial filtering, image smoothing, sharpening, and edge detection is performed. Secondly, we demonstrate QCNN in recognizing image, namely, the recognition of handwritten numbers. Compared with previous work, this machine learning model can provide implementable quantum circuits that accurately corresponds to a specific classical convolutional kernel. It provides an efficient avenue to transform CNN to QCNN directly and opens up the prospect of exploiting quantum power to process information in the era of big data.

TI The Rayleigh-Lorentz invariant for superconducting resonators and
   optimal adiabatic qubit-information detection
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB Dynamical properties of a resonator can be analyzed using the Rayleigh-Lorentz invariant which is not an exact constant but varies more or less over time depending on variations of parameters. We investigate the time behavior of this invariant for a superconducting nano-resonator in order for better understanding of qubit-information detection with the resonator. Superconducting resonators which uses parametric resonance in a Josephson junction circuit can be utilized in implementing diverse next generation nano-optic and nano-electronic devices such as quantum computing systems. Through the analyses of the temporal evolution of the invariant, we derive a condition for optimal adiabatic qubit-information detection with the resonator. This condition is helpful for controlling the dynamics of the resonators over long periods of time. It is necessary to consider it when designing a nano-resonator used for quantum nondemolition readouts of qubit states, crucial in quantum computation.

TI Improving quantum annealing by engineering the coupling to the
   environment
SO EPJ QUANTUM TECHNOLOGY
AB A large class of optimisation problems can be mapped to the Ising model where all details are encoded in the coupling of spins. The task of the original mathematical optimisation is then equivalent to finding the ground state of the corresponding spin system which can be achieved via quantum annealing relying on the adiabatic theorem. Some of the inherent disadvantages of this procedure can be alleviated or resolved using a stochastic approach, and by coupling to the external environment. We show that careful engineering of the system-bath coupling at an individual spin level can further improve annealing.

AB The quantum simulation kernel is an important subroutine appearing as a very long gate sequence in many quantum programs. In this paper, we propose Paulihedral, a block-wise compiler framework that can deeply optimize this subroutine by exploiting high-level program structure and optimization opportunities. Paulihedral first employs a new Pauli intermediate representation that can maintain the high-level semantics and constraints in quantum simulation kernels. This naturally enables new large-scale optimizations that are hard to implement at the low gate-level. In particular, we propose two technology-independent instruction scheduling passes, and two technology-dependent code optimization passes which reconcile the circuit synthesis, gate cancellation, and qubit mapping stages of the compiler. Experimental results show that Paulihedral can outperform state-of-the-art compiler infrastructures in a wide-range of applications on both near-term superconducting quantum processors and future fault-tolerant quantum computers.

TI Experimental entanglement quantification for unknown quantum states in a
   semi-device-independent manner
SO SCIENCE CHINA-INFORMATION SCIENCES
AB Using the concept of non-degenerate Bell inequality, we show that quantum entanglement, the critical resource for various quantum information processing tasks, can be quantified for any unknown quantum state in a semi-device-independent manner, where the quantification is based on the experimentally obtained probability distributions and prior knowledge of the quantum dimension only. Specifically, as an application of our approach to multi-level systems, we experimentally quantify the entanglement of formation and the entanglement of distillation for qutrit-qutrit quantum systems. In addition, to demonstrate our approach for multi-partite systems, we further quantify the geometric measure of entanglement of three-qubit quantum systems. Our results supply a general way to reliably quantify entanglement in multi-level and multi-partite systems, thus paving the way to characterize many-body quantum systems by quantifying the involved entanglement.

TI Inverted fine structure of a 6H-SiC qubit enabling robust spin-photon
   interface
SO NPJ QUANTUM INFORMATION
AB Controllable solid-state spin qubits are currently becoming useful building blocks for applied quantum technologies. Here, we demonstrate that in a specific type of silicon-vacancy in the 6H-SiC polytype the excited-state fine structure is inverted, compared to 4H-SiC. From the angular polarization dependencies of the emission, we reconstruct the spatial symmetry and determine the optical selection rules depending on the local deformation and spin-orbit interaction. We show that this system is well suited for the implementation of robust spin-photon entanglement schemes. Furthermore, the inverted fine structure leads to unexpected behavior of the spin readout contrast. It vanishes and recovers with lattice cooling due to two competing optical spin pumping mechanisms. Our experimental and theoretical approaches provide a deep insight into the optical and spin properties of atomic-scale qubits in SiC required for quantum communication and distributed quantum information processing.

TI Refining resource estimation for the quantum computation of vibrational
   molecular spectra through Trotter error analysis
SO QUANTUM
AB Accurate simulations of vibrational molecular spectra are expensive on conventional computers. Compared to the electronic structure problem, the vibrational structure problem with quantum computers is less investigated. In this work we accurately estimate quantum resources, such as number of logical qubits and quantum gates, required for vibrational structure calculations on a programmable quantum computer. Our approach is based on quantum phase estimation and focuses on fault-tolerant quantum devices. In addition to asymptotic estimates for generic chemical compounds, we present a more detailed analysis of the quantum resources needed for the simulation of the Hamiltonian arising in the vibrational structure calculation of acetylene-like polyynes of interest. Leveraging nested commutators, we provide an in-depth quantitative analysis of trotter errors compared to the prior investigations. Ultimately, this work serves as a guide for analyzing the potential quantum advantage within vibrational structure simulations.

TI Computing conditional entropies for quantum correlations
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB The rates of quantum cryptographic protocols are usually expressed in terms of a conditional entropy minimized over a certain set of quantum states. In particular, in the device-independent setting, the minimization is over all the quantum states jointly held by the adversary and the parties that are consistent with the statistics that are seen by the parties. Here, we introduce a method to approximate such entropic quantities. Applied to the setting of device-independent randomness generation and quantum key distribution, we obtain improvements on protocol rates in various settings. In particular, we find new upper bounds on the minimal global detection efficiency required to perform device-independent quantum key distribution without additional preprocessing. Furthermore, we show that our construction can be readily combined with the entropy accumulation theorem in order to establish full finite-key security proofs for these protocols. Simple lower bounds on the rates of device-independent quantum information protocols can often overestimate the power of the eavesdropping party. Here, the authors use new entropic quantities defined as semidefinite programs to improve bounds in several regimes without expensive computational resources

TI Optimization and performance investigation of 1-Toffoli gate quantum
   full adders for spin-torque-based n-qubit architecture
SO OPTICAL AND QUANTUM ELECTRONICS
AB Quantum computing (QC) is suitable for reversible computing due to its inherent parallel processing ability and fast speed. It also helps to address the issue of high-power dissipation in classical computing. Moreover, QC gates are the sequence of elementary operations such as single-qubit rotation and two-qubit entanglement. Elementary quantum operations are required to be reduced for the realization of complex computing. In this paper, optimization of 1-Toffoli gate-based quantum full adders (QFAs) in terms of the number of elementary operations with the help of quantum library {R-y, R-z, root SWAP} is carried out. Moreover, the performance of two different 1-Toffoli QFAs is investigated in terms of execution time, fidelity, and number of electrons required to realize the QFAs. Improvement in fidelity is 0.7% and 0.57% for QFA1 and QFA2, respectively, compared to the fidelity of 2-Toffoli QFA. A 9.97% increase in execution time is mandatory for the QFA2 compared to QFA1. The QFA2 takes 5% more number of electrons in comparison to QFA1.

TI A multi-commodity network model for optimal quantum reversible circuit
   synthesis
SO PLOS ONE
AB Quantum computing is a newly emerging computing environment that has recently attracted intense research interest in improving the output fidelity, fully utilizing its high computing power from both hardware and software perspectives. In particular, several attempts have been made to reduce the errors in quantum computing algorithms through the efficient synthesis of quantum circuits. In this study, we present an application of an optimization model for synthesizing quantum circuits with minimum implementation costs to lower the error rates by forming a simpler circuit. Our model has a unique structure that combines the arc-subset selection problem with a conventional multi-commodity network flow model. The model targets the circuit synthesis with multiple control Toffoli gates to implement Boolean reversible functions that are often used as a key component in many quantum algorithms. Compared to previous studies, the proposed model has a unifying yet straightforward structure for exploiting the operational characteristics of quantum gates. Our computational experiment shows the potential of the proposed model, obtaining quantum circuits with significantly lower quantum costs compared to prior studies. The proposed model is also applicable to various other fields where reversible logic is utilized, such as low-power computing, fault-tolerant designs, and DNA computing. In addition, our model can be applied to network-based problems, such as logistics distribution and time-stage network problems.

TI Capacities of Gaussian Quantum Channels With Passive Environment
   Assistance
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INFORMATION THEORY
AB Passive environment-assisted communication takes place via a quantum channel modeled as a unitary interaction between the information carrying system and an environment, where the latter is controlled by a passive helper, who can set its initial state such as to assist sender and receiver, but not help actively by adjusting her behaviour depending on the message. Here we investigate the information transmission capabilities in this framework by considering Gaussian unitaries acting on Bosonic systems. We consider both quantum communication and classical communication with helper, as well as classical communication with free classical coordination between sender and helper (conferencing encoders). Concerning quantum communication, we prove general coding theorems with and without energy constraints, yielding multi-letter (regularized) expressions. In the search for cases where the capacity formula is computable, we look for Gaussian unitaries that are universally degradable or anti-degradable. However, we show that no Gaussian unitary yields either a degradable or anti-degradable channel for all environment states. On the other hand, restricting to Gaussian environment states, results in universally degradable unitaries, for which we thus can give single-letter quantum capacity formulas. Concerning classical communication, we prove a general coding theorem for the classical capacity under an energy constraint, given by a multi-letter expression. Furthermore, we derive an uncertainty-type relation between the classical capacities of the sender and the helper, helped respectively by the other party, showing a lower bound on the sum of the two capacities. Then, this is used to lower bound the classical information transmission rate in the scenario of classical communication between sender and helper.

SO NANO CONVERGENCE
AB Recent development of controlling quantum systems has enabled us to utilize the systems for quantum computing, communication, and sensing. In particular, quantum sensing has attracted attention to a broad community of science and technology, as it could surpass classical limitations in measuring physical quantities such as electric and magnetic field with unprecedented precision. Among various physical platforms for quantum sensing, trapped-ion based system possesses several advantages-atomic size, outstanding quantum coherence, and quantum properties.

TI Learning to decode logical circuits
SO NATURE COMPUTATIONAL SCIENCE
AB As quantum hardware advances toward enabling error-corrected quantum circuits in the near future, the absence of an efficient polynomial-time decoding algorithm for logical circuits presents a critical bottleneck. While quantum memory decoding has been well studied, inevitable correlated errors introduced by transversal entangling logical gates prevent the straightforward generalization of quantum memory decoders. Here we introduce a data-centric, modular decoder framework, the Multi-Core Circuit Decoder (MCCD), which consists of decoder modules corresponding to each logical operation supported by the quantum hardware. The MCCD handles both single-qubit and entangling gates within a unified framework. We train MCCD using mirror-symmetric random Clifford circuits, demonstrating its ability to effectively learn correlated decoding patterns. Through extensive testing on circuits substantially deeper than those used in training, we show that MCCD maintains high logical accuracy while exhibiting competitive polynomial decoding time across increasing circuit depths and code distances. When compared with conventional decoders such as minimum weight perfect matching (MWPM), most likely error (MLE) and belief propagation with ordered statistics post-processing (BP-OSD), MCCD achieves competitive accuracy with substantially better time efficiency, particularly for circuits with entangling gates. Our approach provides a noise-model-agnostic solution to the decoding challenge in deep logical quantum circuits.

TI Towards experimental classical verification of quantum computation
SO QUANTUM SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB With today's quantum processors venturing into regimes beyond the capabilities of classical devices, we face the challenge to verify that these devices perform as intended, even when we cannot check their results on classical computers. In a recent breakthrough in computer science, a protocol was developed that allows the verification of the output of a computation performed by an untrusted quantum device based only on classical resources. Here, we follow these ideas, and demonstrate in a first, proof-of-principle experiment the verification of the output of a quantum computation using only classical means on a small trapped-ion quantum processor. We contrast this to verification protocols, which require trust and detailed hardware knowledge, as in gate-level benchmarking, or additional quantum resources in case we do not have access to or trust in the device to be tested. While our experimental demonstration uses a simplified version of Mahadev's protocol we demonstrate the necessary steps for verifying fully untrusted devices. A scaled-up version of our protocol will allow for classical verification, requiring no hardware access or detailed knowledge of the tested device. Its security relies on post-quantum secure trapdoor functions within an interactive proof. The conceptually straightforward, but technologically challenging scaled-up version of the interactive proofs, considered here, can be used for a variety of additional tasks such as verifying quantum advantage, generating and certifying quantum randomness, or composable remote state preparation.

TI A Machine Learning Study of High Robustness Quantum Walk Search
   Algorithm with Qudit Householder Coins
SO ALGORITHMS
AB In this work, the quantum random walk search algorithm with a walk coin constructed by generalized Householder reflection and phase multiplier has been studied. The coin register is one qudit with an arbitrary dimension. Monte Carlo simulations, in combination with supervised machine learning, are used to find walk coins that make the quantum algorithm more robust to deviations in the coin's parameters. This is achieved by introducing functional dependence between these parameters. The functions that give the best performance of the algorithm are studied in detail by numerical statistical methods. A thorough comparison between our modification and an algorithm, with coins made using only Householder reflection, shows significant advantages of the former. By applying a deep neural network, we make a prediction for the parameters of an optimal coin with an arbitrary size and estimate the algorithm's stability for such a coin.

TI Variational quantum compiling with double Q-learning
SO NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB Quantum compiling aims to construct a quantum circuit V by quantum gates drawn from a native gate alphabet, which is functionally equivalent to the target unitary U. It is a crucial stage for the running of quantum algorithms on noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices. However, the space for structure exploration of quantum circuit is enormous, resulting in the requirement of human expertise, hundreds of experimentations or modifications from existing quantum circuits. In this paper, we propose a variational quantum compiling (VQC) algorithm based on reinforcement learning, in order to automatically design the structure of quantum circuit for VQC with no human intervention. An agent is trained to sequentially select quantum gates from the native gate alphabet and the qubits they act on by double Q-learning with epsilon-greedy exploration strategy and experience replay. At first, the agent randomly explores a number of quantum circuits with different structures, and then iteratively discovers structures with higher performance on the learning task. Simulation results show that the proposed method can make exact compilations with less quantum gates compared to previous VQC algorithms. It can reduce the errors of quantum algorithms due to decoherence process and gate noise in NISQ devices, and enable quantum algorithms especially for complex algorithms to be executed within coherence time.

TI Review of the application of quantum annealing-related technologies in
   transportation optimization
SO QUANTUM INFORMATION PROCESSING
AB Traffic optimization remains a significant challenge in urban planning and transportation management. While efficient traffic optimization is crucial for enhancing urban mobility, reducing congestion, and promoting environmental sustainability, traditional computational methods often struggle with the complex, dynamic nature of traffic systems. Recent advances in quantum computing, particularly quantum annealing, offer promising new techniques that could revolutionize traffic flow optimization. This work systematically reviews the literature, starting with search term formulation and ending with the final set of articles. These articles are categorized into three groups: (1) traffic signal control, (2) traffic flow optimization, and (3) routing problems optimization (including vehicle routing problem and traveling salesman problem). The review critically examines current studies on quantum annealing-based traffic optimization, focusing on contributions, methods, solvers, problem suitability, key findings, benchmark fairness, and limitations. It identifies key challenges and provides recommendations for future research. Insights from this work offer researchers and practitioners a concise overview of current challenges and future directions in traffic optimization.

TI SU(d)-symmetric random unitaries: quantum scrambling, error
   correction, and machine learning
SO NPJ QUANTUM INFORMATION
AB Quantum information processing in the presence of continuous symmetry is of wide importance and exhibits many novel physical and mathematical phenomena. SU(d) is a continuous symmetry group of particular interest since it represents a fundamental type of non-Abelian symmetry and also plays a vital role in quantum computation. Here, we explicate three particularly interesting applications of SU(d)-symmetric random unitaries in diverse contexts ranging from physics to quantum computing: information scrambling with non-Abelian conserved quantities, covariant quantum error correcting random codes, and geometric quantum machine learning. First, we show that, in the presence of SU(d) symmetry, the local conserved quantities would exhibit residual values even at t -> infinity which decays as Omega(1/n3/2) under local Pauli basis for qubits and Omega(1/n(d+2)2/2)\documentclass[12pt]{minimal} \usepackage{amsmath} \usepackage{wasysym} \usepackage{amsfonts} \usepackage{amssymb} \usepackage{amsbsy} \usepackage{mathrsfs} \usepackage{upgreek} \setlength{\oddsidemargin}{-69pt} \begin{document}$$\Omega (1/{n}<^>{{(d+2)}<^>{2}/2})$$\end{document} under local symmetric basis for general qudits with respect to the system size, in contrast to O(1/n) decay for U(1) case and the exponential decay for no-symmetry case in the sense of out-of-time ordered correlator (OTOC). Second, we show that SU(d)-symmetric unitaries can be used to construct asymptotically optimal (in the sense of saturating the fundamental limits on the code error, or the approximate Eastin-Knill theorems) SU(d)-covariant codes (codes with universal transversal gates) that encode any constant number of logical qudits, extending [Kong & Liu; PRXQ 3, 020314 (2022)]. Finally, we derive an overpartameterization threshold via the quantum neural tangent kernel (QNTK) required for exponential convergence guarantee of generic ansatz for geometric quantum machine learning, which reveals that the number of parameters required scales only with the dimension of desired subspaces rather than that of the entire Hilbert space. Our work invites further research on quantum information with continuous symmetries, where the mathematical tools developed in this work are expected to be useful.

TI A Distributed and Parallel (k, n) QSS Scheme with
   Verification Capability
SO MATHEMATICS
AB This paper presents a new quantum secret sharing scheme featuring a (k, n) threshold and built-in verification. This innovative protocol takes advantage of entanglement and unfolds in three distinct phases. In anticipation of the coming of the distributed quantum computing era, this protocol is designed to function entirely in parallel within a fully distributed environment, where the spymaster and her agents are located in different places. This is a significant shift from most similar protocols that assume that all information recipients are in one location. The spymaster can send all necessary information to her agents at once, streamlining the process. Each phase runs simultaneously, which helps to reduce the overall execution cost. Given its complexity, we offer a thorough analysis to ensure its information-theoretic security, protecting against both external eavesdroppers and internal rogue agents. The protocol does away with the need for quantum signatures or pre-shared keys, making it simpler and less complex. Lastly, its potential for implementation on current quantum computers looks promising since it relies only on CNOT and Hadamard gates, with all participants using similar or identical quantum circuits.

TI Shape-preserving storage of elegant Ince-Gaussian modes in warm atomic
   vapor
SO CHINESE OPTICS LETTERS
AB Multimode photonic quantum memory could enhance the information processing speed in a quantum repeater-based quan-tum network. A large obstacle that impedes the storage of the spatial multimode in a hot atomic ensemble is atomic dif-fusion, which severely disturbs the structure of the retrieved light field. In this paper, we demonstrate that the elegant Ince-Gaussian (eIG) mode possesses the ability to resist such diffusion. Our experimental results show that the overall structure of the eIG modes under different parameters maintains well after microseconds of storage. In contrast, the standard IG modes under the same circumstance are disrupted and become unrecognizable. Our findings could promote the construc-tion of quantum networks based on room-temperature atoms.

Due to existing no-go theorems in topological quantum error correction regarding fractal noise, this gives holographic codes a specific advantage over topological codes. We then further argue that a boundary subregion in the shape of the Sierpinski gasket in AdS(5)/CFT4 does not possess these holographic quantum error correction properties.

TI Experimental Realization of a Protected Superconducting Circuit Derived
   from the 0-π Qubit
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB Encoding a qubit in logical quantum states with wave functions characterized by disjoint support and robust energies can offer simultaneous protection against relaxation and pure dephasing. One of the most promising candidates for such a fully protected superconducting qubit is the 0-pi circuit [Brooks et al., Phys. Rev. A 87, 052306 (2013)]. Here we realize the proposed circuit topology in an experimentally obtainable parameter regime, where the ground-state degeneracy is lifted but the qubit is still largely noise protected. More precisely, the logical states of this qubit feature disjoint support and are exponentially protected against relaxation and exponentially (first order) protected against dephasing due to charge (flux) noise. We name the resultant device the "soft 0-pi qubit." Multitone spectroscopy measurements reveal the energy-level structure of the system, which can be precisely described by a simple two-mode Hamiltonian. Using a Raman-type protocol, we exploit a higher-lying charge-insensitive energy level of the device to realize coherent population transfer and logical operations. The measured relaxation (T-1 = 1.6 ms) and dephasing (T-R = 9 mu s, T-2E = 25 mu s) times demonstrate that the soft 0-pi circuit not only broadens the family of superconducting qubits but also constitutes an important step toward quantum computing with intrinsically protected superconducting qubits.

TI Improved Belief Propagation Decoding Algorithms for Surface Codes
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON QUANTUM ENGINEERING
AB Quantum error correction is crucial for universal fault-tolerant quantum computing. Highly accurate and low-time-complexity decoding algorithms play an indispensable role in ensuring quantum error correction works effectively. Among existing decoding algorithms, belief propagation (BP) is notable for its nearly linear time complexity and general applicability to stabilizer codes. However, BP's decoding accuracy without postprocessing is unsatisfactory in most situations. This article focuses on improving the decoding accuracy of BP over GF(4) for surface codes. Inspired by machine learning optimization techniques, we first propose Momentum-BP and AdaGrad-BP to reduce oscillations in message updating, breaking the trapping sets of surface codes. We further propose exponential weighted average initialization belief propagation (EWAInit-BP), which adaptively updates initial probabilities and provides a one to three orders of magnitude improvement over traditional BP for planar surface code, toric code, and XZZX surface code without any postprocessing method, showing high decoding accuracy even under parallel scheduling. The theoretical O(1) time complexity under parallel implementation and high accuracy of EWAInit-BP make it a promising candidate for high-precision real-time decoders.

TI Towards a Multi-Pixel Photon-to-Digital Converter for Time-Bin Quantum
   Key Distribution
SO SENSORS
AB We present an integrated single-photon detection device custom designed for quantum key distribution (QKD) with time-bin encoded single photons. We implemented and demonstrated a prototype photon-to-digital converter (PDC) that integrates an 8 x 8 single-photon avalanche diode (SPAD) array with on-chip digital signal processing built in TSMC 65 nm CMOS. The prototype SPADs are used to validate the QKD functionalities with an array of time-to-digital converters (TDCs) to timestamp and process the photon detection events. The PDC uses window gating to reject noise counts and on-chip processing to sort the photon detections into respective time-bins. The PDC prototype achieved a 22.7 ps RMS timing resolution and demonstrated operation in a time-bin setup with 158 ps time-bins at an optical wavelength of 410 nm. This PDC can therefore be an important building block for a QKD receiver and enables compact and robust time-bin QKD systems with imaging detectors.

TI Precise image generation on current noisy quantum computing devices
SO QUANTUM SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB The quantum angle generator (QAG) is a new full quantum machine learning model designed to generate accurate images on current noise intermediate scale quantum devices. Variational quantum circuits form the core of the QAG model, and various circuit architectures are evaluated. In combination with the so-called MERA-upsampling architecture, the QAG model achieves excellent results, which are analyzed and evaluated in detail. To our knowledge, this is the first time that a quantum model has achieved such accurate results. To explore the robustness of the model to noise, an extensive quantum noise study is performed. In this paper, it is demonstrated that the model trained on a physical quantum device learns the noise characteristics of the hardware and generates outstanding results. It is verified that even a quantum hardware machine calibration change during training of up to 8% can be well tolerated. For demonstration, the model is employed in indispensable simulations in high energy physics required to measure particle energies and, ultimately, to discover unknown particles at the large Hadron Collider at CERN.

TI Quantum correlations versus spin magnitude: Transition to the classical
   limit
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Quantum-classical transitions have long attracted much attention. We study such transitions in quantum spin(j,1/2) systems at thermal equilibrium. Unlike previous work [Phys. Rev. A 73, 064302 (2006)], we find that the threshold temperature of quantum entanglement decreases with increasing spin j and completely disappears in the limit j -> infinity. In the ground state of systems with highly symmetric interactions, the discord-type quantum correlations can exist even for arbitrarily large spin. Such correlations turn out to be unstable and are destroyed by small perturbations that violate the symmetry of the Hamiltonian. The stable quantum correlations gradually degrade as the spin j grows and eventually vanish when the classical limit is reached.

TI Quantum Error Correction Realized by the Renormalization Group in Scalar
   Field Theories
SO PROGRESS OF THEORETICAL AND EXPERIMENTAL PHYSICS
AB We demonstrate that quantum error correction is realized by the renormalization group in scalar field theories. We construct q-level states by using coherent states in the IR region. By acting on them the inverse of the unitary operator U that describes the renormalization group flow of the ground state, we encode them into states in the UV region. We find the situations in which the Knill-Laflamme condition is satisfied for operators that create coherent states. We verify this to the first order in the perturbation theory. This result suggests a general relationship between the renormalization group and quantum error correction and should give insights into understanding the role played by them in the gauge/gravity correspondence.

TI On Covert Quantum Sensing and the Benefits of Entanglement
SO IEEE JOURNAL ON SELECTED AREAS IN INFORMATION THEORY
AB Motivated by applications to covert quantum radar, we analyze a covert quantum sensing problem, in which a legitimate user aims at estimating an unknown parameter taking finitely many values by probing a quantum channel while remaining undetectable from an adversary receiving the probing signals through another quantum channel. When channels are classical-quantum, we characterize the optimal error exponent under a covertness constraint for sensing strategies in which probing signals do not depend on past observations. When the legitimate user's channel is a unitary depending on the unknown parameter, we provide achievability and converse results that show how one can significantly improve covertness using an entangled input state.

TI Nonlocality of three-qubit states of a nuclear spin-7/2
SO QUANTUM INFORMATION PROCESSING
AB Advances in quantum information processing can open a way for numerous applications of the processing in various fields of science and technology: communication, precision measurement, computing, nano-scale detectors, and sensors. Classical and various quantum correlations have been studied in real spin 1/2 systems. The nonlocality measures provide a novel classification scheme for bipartite states, highlighting that nonlocality is a quantum resource distinct from other types of quantum correlations. We first studied the temperature and field dependencies of nonlocality measure in the three fictitious spin 1/2 system, which represents a nuclear spin-7/2 placed in magnetic and inhomogeneous electric fields. The relationship between nonlocality and other quantum correlations (entanglement and geometric discord) was studied. The Hamiltonian and spin operators for a spin 7/2 are represented in the basis formed by the Kronecker products of the Pauli matrices. This transformation allows us to represent a spin 7/2 as a system of three coupled fictitious spins 1/2 and, from the quantum information point of view, as an equivalent system of three coupling qubits. Well-developed methods were used to calculate measures of quantum correlations. For example, we consider 59 Co (spin 7/2) in the compounds [Co(NH3)5Cl]Cl2 and Ca3Co2O6. The interaction between the fictitious spins of 59Co nuclei depends on the magnitude and direction of the external magnetic field. Other potential cases of quantum correlations can be realized based on nuclear spins 7/2 in solid-state systems, for instance, such as 51V, 165Ho, or 123Sb.

TI Efficient algorithms for quantum information bottleneck
SO QUANTUM
AB The ability to extract relevant information is critical to learning. An ingenious approach as such is the information bottleneck, an optimi-sation problem whose solution corresponds to a faithful and memory-efficient representation of relevant information from a large system. The advent of the age of quantum computing calls for efficient methods that work on infor-mation regarding quantum systems. Here we address this by proposing a new and general algorithm for the quantum generalisation of in-formation bottleneck. Our algorithm excels in the speed and the definiteness of convergence compared with prior results. It also works for a much broader range of problems, including the quantum extension of deterministic infor-mation bottleneck, an important variant of the original information bottleneck problem. No-tably, we discover that a quantum system can achieve strictly better performance than a clas-sical system of the same size regarding quan-tum information bottleneck, providing new vi-sion on justifying the advantage of quantum machine learning.

TI Instanton-like effect caused by qubit-boson interaction in light of
   quantum simulation
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB The renormalized quantum Rabi model describing a qubit-boson interaction has the transition from SUSY to its spontaneous breaking under suitable conditions. It is caused by how the X-gate coupled to the Bose field works properly between the two symmetrical wells made by the bosons coupled to a qubit. According to Polyakov's idea, there is the possibility that an instanton tunneling the barrier between those symmetrical wells appears as the classical trajectory. In this paper, therefore, under a physical condition, we show the vestige of the particle like an instanton in the expression of the ground-state energy of the quantum Rabi model.

TI Dynamical learning of a photonics quantum-state engineering process
SO ADVANCED PHOTONICS
AB Experimental engineering of high-dimensional quantum states is a crucial task for several quantum information protocols. However, a high degree of precision in the characterization of the noisy experimental apparatus is required to apply existing quantum-state engineering protocols. This is often lacking in practical scenarios, affecting the quality of the engineered states. We implement, experimentally, an automated adaptive optimization protocol to engineer photonic orbital angular momentum (OAM) states. The protocol, given a target output state, performs an online estimation of the quality of the currently produced states, relying on output measurement statistics, and determines how to tune the experimental parameters to optimize the state generation. To achieve this, the algorithm does not need to be imbued with a description of the generation apparatus itself. Rather, it operates in a fully black-box scenario, making the scheme applicable in a wide variety of circumstances. The handles controlled by the algorithm are the rotation angles of a series of waveplates and can be used to probabilistically generate arbitrary four-dimensional OAM states. We showcase our scheme on different target states both in classical and quantum regimes and prove its robustness to external perturbations on the control parameters. This approach represents a powerful tool for automated optimizations of noisy experimental tasks for quantum information protocols and technologies.

TI Real-space blocking of qubit variables on parallel lattice gauge theory
   links for quantum simulation
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW D
AB One of the methods proposed in recent years for studying nonperturbative gauge theory physics is quantum simulation, where lattice gauge theories are mapped onto quantum devices which can be built in the laboratory, or quantum computers. While being very promising and already showing some experimental results, these methods still face several challenges related to the interface between the technological capabilities and the demands of the simulated models; in particular, one such challenge is the need to simulate infinitely dimensional local Hilbert spaces, describing the gauge fields on the links in the case of compact Lie gauge groups, requiring some truncations and approximations which are not completely understood or controllable in the general case. This work proposes a way to obtain arbitrarily large such local Hilbert spaces by using coarse graining of simple, low-dimensional qubit systems, made of components available on most quantum simulation platforms, and thus opening the way to new types of lattice gauge theory quantum simulations.

TI Randomized Compiling for Scalable Quantum Computing on a Noisy
   Superconducting Quantum Processor
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW X
AB The successful implementation of algorithms on quantum processors relies on the accurate control of quantum bits (qubits) to perform logic gate operations. In this era of noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) computing, systematic miscalibrations, drift, and crosstalk in the control of qubits can lead to a coherent form of error that has no classical analog. Coherent errors severely limit the performance of quantum algorithms in an unpredictable manner, and mitigating their impact is necessary for realizing reliable quantum computations. Moreover, the average error rates measured by randomized benchmarking and related protocols are not sensitive to the full impact of coherent errors and therefore do not reliably predict the global performance of quantum algorithms, leaving us unprepared to validate the accuracy of future large-scale quantum computations. Randomized compiling is a protocol designed to overcome these performance limitations by converting coherent errors into stochastic noise, dramatically reducing unpredictable errors in quantum algorithms and enabling accurate predictions of algorithmic performance from error rates measured via cycle benchmarking. In this work, we demonstrate significant performance gains under randomized compiling for the four-qubit quantum Fourier transform algorithm and for random circuits of variable depth on a superconducting quantum processor. Additionally, we accurately predict algorithm performance using experimentally measured error rates. Our results demonstrate that randomized compiling can be utilized to leverage and predict the capabilities of modern-day noisy quantum processors, paving the way forward for scalable quantum computing.

Results of practical experiments are also presented using D-Wave's 5,000 qubit Advantage 1.1 quantum annealer and the performance is compared to a classical solver. It is found the quantum annealer can only handle a problem size of 8 or less nodes and its performance is subpar compared to the classical solver both in terms of time and accuracy.

TI Entanglement-Assisted Entanglement Purification
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB The efficient generation of high-fidelity entangled states is the key element for long-distance quantum communication, quantum computation, and other quantum technologies, and at the same time the most resource-consuming part in many schemes. We present a class of entanglement-assisted entanglement purification protocols that can generate high-fidelity entanglement from noisy, finite-size ensembles with improved yield and fidelity as compared to previous approaches. The scheme utilizes high-dimensional auxiliary entanglement to perform entangling nonlocal measurements and determine the number and positions of errors in an ensemble in a controlled and efficient way, without disturbing the entanglement of good pairs. Our protocols can deal with arbitrary errors, but are best suited for few errors, and work particularly well for decay noise. Our methods are applicable to moderately sized ensembles, as will be important for near term quantum devices.

TI Greedy parameter optimization for diabatic quantum annealing
SO PHILOSOPHICAL TRANSACTIONS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY A-MATHEMATICAL PHYSICAL
   AND ENGINEERING SCIENCES
AB A shorter processing time is desirable for quantum computation to minimize the effects of noise. We propose a simple procedure to variationally determine a set of parameters in the transverse-field Ising model for quantum annealing (QA) appended with a field along the y-axis. The method consists of greedy optimization of the signs of coefficients of the y-field term based on the outputs of short annealing processes. We test the idea in the ferromagnetic system with all-to-all couplings and spin-glass problems, and find that the method outperforms the traditional form of QA and simulated annealing in terms of the success probability and the time to solution, in particular, in the case of shorter annealing times, achieving the goal of improved performance while avoiding noise. The non-stoquastic sigma y term can be eliminated by a rotation in the spin space, resulting in a non-trivial diabatic control of the coefficients in the stoquastic transverse-field Ising model, which may be feasible for experimental realization. This article is part of the theme issue 'Quantum annealing and computation: challenges and perspectives'.

AB We study algorithms for solving the problem of assembling a text (long string) from a dictionary (a sequence of small strings). The problem has an application in bioinformatics and has a connection with the sequence assembly method for reconstructing a long deoxyribonucleic-acid (DNA) sequence from small fragments. The problem is assembling a string t of length n from strings s(1), ..., s(m). Firstly, we provide a classical (randomized) algorithm with running time (O) over tilde (nL(0.5) + L) where L is the sum of lengths of s(1), ..., s(m). Secondly, we provide a quantum algorithm with running time (O) over tilde (nL(0.25) + root mL). Thirdly, we show the lower bound for a classical (randomized or deterministic) algorithm that is Omega(n+L). So, we obtain the quadratic quantum speed-up with respect to the parameter L; and our quantum algorithm have smaller running time comparing to any classical (randomized or deterministic) algorithm in the case of non-constant length of strings in the dictionary.

TI Future-Proofing Security for UAVs With Post-Quantum Cryptography: A
   Review
SO IEEE OPEN JOURNAL OF THE COMMUNICATIONS SOCIETY
AB Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), commonly known as drones, are increasingly being employed across a broad spectrum of applications, ranging from military operations to commercial purposes. However, as UAVs become more integrated into everyday life, security and privacy concerns are similarly escalating due to vulnerabilities arising from operating on open wireless channels and having limited onboard computational resources. Moreover, with the emergence of quantum computers, conventional cryptographic methods that ensure the security and privacy of UAV communications are at severe risk. These risks encompass the possibility of unauthorized access, breaches of data, and cyber-physical attacks that jeopardize the integrity, confidentiality, and availability of UAV operations. Quantum computers are expected to break the conventional cryptography methods, such as symmetric and asymmetric schemes, with the support of Grover's and Shor's algorithms, respectively. Consequently, traditional cryptographic algorithms must give way to quantum-resistant algorithms, referred to as Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC) algorithms. Although researchers actively develop, test, and standardize new PQC algorithms, the threat persists despite the progress made through these consistent efforts. This review article first examines the security and privacy landscape, including threats and requirements of UAVs. This article also discusses PQC and various PQC families and the status of the NIST's implementation and standardization process. Lastly, we explore challenges and future directions in implementing PQC for UAVs.

TI Utilizing Quantum Annealing in Computed Tomography Image Reconstruction
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON QUANTUM ENGINEERING
AB One of the primary difficulties in computed tomography (CT) is reconstructing cross-sectional images from measured projections of a physical object. There exist several classical methods for this task of generating a digital representation of the object, including filtered backprojection or simultaneous algebraic reconstruction technique. Our research aims to explore the potential of quantum computing in the field of industrial X-ray transmission tomography. Specifically, this work focuses on the application of a method similar to that proposed by Nau et al. (2023) on real CT data to demonstrate the feasibility of quadratic-unconstrained-binary-optimization-based tomographic reconstruction. Starting with simulated phantoms, results with simulated annealing as well as real annealing hardware are shown, leading to the application on measured cone-beam CT data. The results demonstrate that tomographic reconstruction using quantum annealing is feasible for both simulated and real-world applications. Yet, current limitations-involving the maximum processable size and bit depth of voxel values of the images, both correlated with the number of densely connected qubits within the annealing hardware-imply the need of future research to further improve the results. This approach, despite its early stage, has the potential to enable more sophisticated reconstructions, providing an alternative to traditional classical methods.

Several quantum algorithms, such as Simon's algorithm, Grover's algorithm, the Bernstein-Vazirani algorithm, Shor's algorithm, and the Grover-meets-Simon algorithm, have been proposed successively. However, almost all cryptanalysis is based on the quantum chosen-plaintext attack (qCPA) model. This paper focuses on a powerful cryptanalytic model, quantum related-key attack (qRKA), and proposes a strategy of qRKAs against symmetric ciphers using Simon's algorithm. We construct a periodic function to efficiently recover the secret key of symmetric ciphers if the attacked symmetric ciphers satisfy Simon's promise, and present the complexity analysis on specific symmetric ciphers. Then, we apply qRKA to the Even-Mansour cipher and SoEM construction, recover their secret keys, and show their complexity comparison in the distinct attack models. This work is of great significance for the qRKA cryptanalysis of existing provably secure cryptographic schemes and the design of future quantum secure cryptographic schemes.

TI Analysis and Evaluation of Post-Quantum Cryptography for DNSSEC
SO QUANTUM INFORMATION & COMPUTATION
AB The development of quantum computing poses a threat to many internet protocols because it undermines the security of current asymmetric cryptography. New types of algorithms, collectively known as post-quantum cryptography (PQC), are being developed and tested as potential replacements. Despite being engineered to counter quantum computers using Shor's algorithm, these systems frequently demand larger keys or signatures and substantial computational resources. This complicates the implementation of these algorithms in higher-level protocols, which requires thorough studies of the transition consequences. This paper evaluates the usefulness of one such PQC algorithm, FALCON-512, in the DNSSEC protocol. Using a containerized testbed, simulated DNS traffic is analyzed with a focus on key performance metrics, namely network latency and error rates, as the number of DNS clients in the network increases. The results show that PQC-enabled DNSSEC introduces higher error rates compared to today's algorithms, especially in NSEC responses used to deny the existence of DNS records, which represent a significant increase, resulting in the network's overload. The main contribution of this article is the validation of previous theoretical assumptions on the practical implications of FALCON-512 signature sizes in the implementation to DNSSEC. The differences in latency observed between nameservers in the DNS hierarchy during this study may inform DNS operators during the transition to PQC.

TI Secure Continuous Variable Quantum Cloning Based on EPR Steering
SO ACTA OPTICA SINICA
AB Objective Quantum communication is based on the three principles of uncertainty, measurement collapse, and no-cloning in quantum mechanics. Compared with traditional classical communication methods, quantum communication features security and high efficiency and has great application significance and prospect in information security. In recent years, domestic and international scientists have conducted a lot of research on theories and experiments and made outstanding achievements in long-distance transmission and practical network of quantum communication. Quantum teleportation and quantum cloning have caught extensive attention as important protocols in quantum communication. With the help of quantum entanglement and classical communication, the transmission of any unknown quantum state from one location to another can be realized. As important resources of quantum information, quantum entanglement and EPR steering are widely adopted in various quantum communication tasks. The natural asymmetry of EPR steering makes quantum steering a helpful resource in various quantum information processes. In the tasks of single-side device-independent quantum-key distribution, secure quantum teleportation, and subchannel discrimination, quantum steering can improve key acquisition rate, and enhance the protocol efficiency and security. In 2000, Cerf N J et al. proposed quantum cloning of Gaussian states with continuous variables and gave the fidelity boundary of quantum cloning as 2/3. In 2001, the Grangier P group presented the quantum and classical fidelity boundary of coherent state continuous variable quantum cloning under Heisenberg representation. For coherent state input, quantum teleportation is achieved when the fidelity exceeds the classical limit of 1/2, which is the best value that can be obtained without entanglement. However, it is necessary to have certain requirements for entangled beams to realize quantum teleportation with a fidelity greater than 2/3. In 2004, the Furusawa group applied three single-mode OPOs to obtain a continuous variable quantum teleportation network with an optimal fidelity of 0. 64, and then they utilized four OPOs to achieve quantum teleportation with a fidelity of 0. 7. In 2012, Pan J W group experimentally realized long-distance quantum teleportation. In 2018, Wei J H et al. put forward a quantum teleportation scheme using non-maximum entangled states for measurement. In 2018, Wang K et al. studied teleportation by partially entangled GHZ states. The analysis based on quantum cloning shows that for coherent state inputs, secure teleportation is guaranteed if the teleportation fidelity is greater than 2/3. To sum up, the research on remote transmission security is still a long-term important topic.
   Methods Based on the basic idea of quantum teleportation, we employ the method of combining quantum channel and classical channel to design a 1. 2 quantum cloning scheme with continuous variables by partially disembodied transport. The relationship between the fidelity of a partially disembodied transport cloning scheme and EPR entanglement source is studied theoretically. Firstly, the fidelity of two output modes in 1. 2 cloning scheme, the entanglement and steering of EPR shared entanglement source are analyzed. Secondly, the relationship between the fidelity of the output mode Clone 1 and the steering characteristics under the optimal gain is studied. Thirdly, the fidelity of the output mode Clone 2 varies with the reflectance and squeezing parameters under the optimal gain of the output mode Clone 1.
   Results and Discussions First, we analyze the variation of the steering between entanglement sources (b) over cap1 and (b) over cap2 and optimal gain with eta(1) and eta(2). Only if eta(1) > 0. 5 there is a steering of (b) over cap (2) by (b) over cap (1), and if eta(2) > 0. 5 there is a steering of (b) over cap (1) by (b) over cap (2). The results are as follows: when eta(1) > 0. 5 and eta(2) > 0. 5, there is a two- way steering between (b) over cap (1) and (b) over cap (2), and the entanglement amount between the sources increases with the improving transmission efficiency eta(1) and eta(2). The range of optimal gain g(opt) = max{g(b2| b1), g(b1| b2)} is root 2 <= g(opt) < 5, and the optimal gain corresponds to the optimal gain of output mode Clone 1, which is not optimal for output mode Clone 2. Second, the fidelity of output modes Clone 1 and Clone 2 varies with.1 and.2 under different reflectance when the optimal gain g(opt) is taken. The fidelity F-1 > 2/3 should be in the two- way steering region, but the fidelity of the two- way steering region may not always meet F-1 > 2/3. Meanwhile, the fidelity of output mode Clone 1 decreases with the increasing reflectivity, and that of output mode Clone 2 reduces with the rising reflectance. Third, the fidelity of output modes Clone 1 and Clone 2 varies with eta(1) and eta(2) under different squeezing parameters when the optimal gain g(opt) is taken. The fidelity of output mode Clone 1 in the two-way steering region is greater than 2/3, and the fidelity beyond the no-cloning threshold can also be achieved by two-way steering under smaller squeezing parameters. The fidelity of the output mode Clone 2 decreases with the increase in squeezing parameters.
   Conclusions In summary, we theoretically investigate the relationship between the fidelity of cloning and EPR steering based on the partially disembodied transport continuous variable 1 -> 2 quantum cloning scheme. Meanwhile, we explore the fidelity variation with the reflectance of the beam-splitter and squeezing parameters at a given gain. The results show that for the output mode Clone 1, when the optimal gain is obtained, the two-way steering of the entanglement source should be shared when the fidelity exceeds the no-cloning threshold, but not all two-way steering resources can make the cloning fidelity greater than 2/3. The fidelity of output mode Clone 1 decreases with the rising reflectance and decreasing squeezing parameters, and the two-way steering can also achieve fidelity beyond the no-cloning threshold under smaller squeezing parameters. Additionally, the fidelity of the output mode Clone 2 reduces with the increasing reflectance and squeezing parameters. Therefore, high cloning fidelity does not require significant squeezing and high reflectivity. Therefore, we can employ the combination of quantum channel and classical channel to improve the cloning fidelity. The two-way quantum steering state is the necessary resource for secure quantum cloning of the coherent states. The research results provide certain references for the security of quantum communication networks.

TI Erasure Detection of a Dual-Rail Qubit Encoded in a Double-Post
   Superconducting Cavity
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB Qubits with predominantly erasure errors present distinctive advantages for quantum error correction (QEC) and fault -tolerant quantum computing. Logical qubits based on dual -rail encoding that exploit erasure detection have been recently proposed in superconducting circuit architectures, with either coupled transmons or cavities. Here, we implement a dual -rail qubit encoded in a compact, double -post superconducting cavity. Using an auxiliary transmon, we perform erasure detection on the dual -rail subspace. We characterize the behavior of the code space by a novel method to perform joint-Wigner tomography. This is based on modifying the cross -Kerr interaction between the cavity modes and the transmon. We measure an erasure rate of 3.981 +/- 0.003 ( ms ) - 1 and a residual, postselected dephasing error rate up to 0.17 ( ms ) - 1 within the code space. This strong hierarchy of error rates, together with the compact and hardware -efficient nature of this novel architecture, holds promise in realizing QEC schemes with enhanced thresholds and improved scaling.

TI Mathematical modeling of processes in quantum computer elements based on
   methods of quantum theory to improve their efficiency
SO COMPUTER OPTICS
AB The paper studies entangled states of two qubits interacting with each other and with an electromagnetic field. The state of the qubits is determined by a statistical density matrix. The degree of entanglement of the state is characterized by the Peres-Gorodeckii (PG) parameter. The statistical density matrix and its evolution are determined in the energy representation within the framework of the path integral formalism. The obtained equations determine the dependence of the PG parameter on the parameters of qubit dipole-dipole interaction and the acting electromagnetic field. The results of numerical calculations are presented in graphs for the PG parameter. It is shown that it is possible to choose parameters corresponding to qubit states with a high degree of entanglement (0.99).

TI Gradient-Ascent Pulse Engineering with Feedback
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB Efficient approaches to quantum control and feedback are essential for quantum technologies, from sensing to quantum computation. Open-loop control tasks have been successfully solved using optimization techniques, including methods such as gradient-ascent pulse engineering (GRAPE) , relying on a differentiable model of the quantum dynamics. For feedback tasks, such methods are not directly applicable, since the aim is to discover strategies conditioned on measurement outcomes. In this work, we introduce feedback GRAPE, which borrows some concepts from model-free reinforcement learning to incorporate the response to strong stochastic (discrete or continuous) measurements, while still performing direct gradient ascent through the quantum dynamics. We illustrate its power considering various scenarios based on cavity-QED setups. Our method yields interpretable feedback strategies for state preparation and stabilization in the presence of noise. Our approach could be employed for discovering strategies in a wide range of feedback tasks, from calibration of multiqubit devices to linear-optics quantum computation strategies, quantum enhanced sensing with adaptive measurements, and quantum error correction.

TI Ultra-low loss quantum photonic circuits integrated with single quantum
   emitters
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB The scaling of many photonic quantum information processing systems is ultimately limited by the flux of quantum light throughout an integrated photonic circuit. Source brightness and waveguide loss set basic limits on the on-chip photon flux. While substantial progress has been made, separately, towards ultra-low loss chip-scale photonic circuits and high brightness single-photon sources, integration of these technologies has remained elusive. Here, we report the integration of a quantum emitter single-photon source with a wafer-scale, ultra-low loss silicon nitride photonic circuit. We demonstrate triggered and pure single-photon emission into a Si3N4 photonic circuit with approximate to 1dB/m propagation loss at a wavelength of approximate to 930nm. We also observe resonance fluorescence in the strong drive regime, showing promise towards coherent control of quantum emitters. These results are a step forward towards scaled chip-integrated photonic quantum information systems in which storing, time-demultiplexing or buffering of deterministically generated single-photons is critical. Applications of ultra-low-loss photonic circuitry in quantum photonics, in particular including triggered single photon sources, are rare. Here, the authors show how InAs quantum dot single photon sources can be integrated onto wafer-scale, CMOS compatible ultra-low loss silicon nitride photonic circuits.

AB The threat of quantum computers has raised concerns about the security of traditional encryption algorithms, prompting the development of post-quantum cryptography. Various solutions have been proposed by the scientific community to address the potential threat posed by quantum computing. This paper aims to conduct an analysis of quantum-secure encryption algorithms such as Kyber and Falcon, with a focus on their performance under the RISC-V Vector Extension and Cryptography Extension. The choice of RISC-V as the research platform stems from its open-source nature and scalability, providing a flexible environment for exploring and evaluating the performance of quantum-secure encryption algorithms. However, achieving a smooth transition from traditional encryption algorithms to post-quantum cryptography requires careful consideration of multiple factors, including algorithm performance, portability, and others. To better understand the performance and feasibility of these solutions, this paper conducts a detailed analysis of PQClean using SIMD Everywhere. PQClean offers not only a pure C version but also a Neon version. SIMD Everywhere can convert Neon intrinsics into RISC-V intrinsics, enabling further analysis of RISC-V code in PQC using the Neon version of PQClean. We further enhanced the performance of SIMD Everywhere through the use of the RISC-V Vector Cryptography Extensions. We analyzed the cryptographic process and conducted advanced optimizations by comparing the differences between Neon and RISC-V intrinsics in the cryptographic design. The entire experimental process was analyzed using LLVM and Spike.

AB The error rates of quantum devices are orders of magnitude higher than what is needed to run most quantum applications. To close this gap, Quantum Error Correction (QEC) encodes logical qubits and distributes information using several physical qubits. By periodically executing a syndrome extraction circuit on the logical qubits, information about errors (called syndrome) is extracted while running programs. A decoder uses these syndromes to identify and correct errors in real time, which is necessary to prevent accumulation of errors. Unfortunately, software decoders are slow and hardware decoders are fast but less accurate. Thus, almost all QEC studies so far have relied on offline decoding.
   To enable real-time decoding in near-term QEC, we propose LILLIPUT- a Lightweight Low Latency Look-Up Table decoder. LILLIPUT consists of two parts- First, it translates syndromes into error detection events that index into a Look-Up Table (LUT) whose entry provides the error information in real-time. Second, it programs the LUTs with error assignments for all possible error events by running a software decoder offline. LILLIPUT tolerates an error on any operation in the quantum hardware, including gates and measurements, and the number of tolerated errors grows with the size of the code. LILLIPUT utilizes less than 7% logic on off-the-shelf FPGAs enabling practical adoption, as FPGAs are already used to design the control and readout circuits in existing systems. LILLIPUT incurs a latency of a few nanoseconds and enables real-time decoding. We also propose Compressed LUTs (CLUTs) to reduce the memory required by LILLIPUT. By exploiting the fact that not all error events are equally likely and only storing data for the most probable error events, CLUTs reduce the memory needed by up-to 107x (from 148 MB to 1.38 MB) without degrading the accuracy.

However, these same topics have remained largely unexplored in the context of emerging interdisciplinary quantum information science (QIS) courses. We conducted 15 exploratory think-aloud interviews with students in an upper-division quantum computing course at a large R1 university cross-listed in the physics and computer science departments. Focusing on responses to one particular problem, we identify two notably consistent problem-solving strategies across students in the context of a particular interview prompt, which we term Naive Measurement Probabilities (NMP) and Virtual Quantum Computer (VQC), respectively. Operating from a resources framework, we interpret these strategies as choices of coherent (and potentially mutually-generative) sets of resources to employ and available actions to perform.

TI Witnessing quantum correlations in a nuclear ensemble via an electron
   spin qubit
SO NATURE PHYSICS
AB A coherent ensemble of spins interfaced with a proxy qubit is an attractive platform to create many-body coherences and probe the regime of collective excitations. An electron spin qubit in a semiconductor quantum dot can act as such an interface to the dense nuclear spin ensemble within the quantum dot consisting of multiple high-spin atomic species. Earlier work has shown that the electron can relay properties of its nuclear environment through the statistics of its mean-field interaction with the total nuclear polarization, namely its mean and variance. Here, we demonstrate a method to probe the spin state of a nuclear ensemble that exploits its response to collective spin excitations, enabling a species-selective reconstruction beyond the mean field. For the accessible range of optically prepared mean fields, the reconstructed populations indicate that the ensemble is in a non-thermal, correlated nuclear state. The sum over reconstructed species-resolved polarizations exceeds the classical prediction threefold. This stark deviation follows from a spin ensemble that contains inter-particle coherences, and serves as an entanglement witness that confirms the formation of a dark many-body state.
   Atoms in a semiconductor can have non-zero nuclear spins, creating a large ensemble with many quantum degrees of freedom. An electron spin coupled to the nuclei of a semiconductor quantum dot can witness the creation of entanglement within the ensemble.

TI Quantum Correlations beyond Entanglement and Discord
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB Dissimilar notions of quantum correlations have been established, each being motivated through particular applications in quantum information science and each competing for being recognized as the most relevant measure of quantumness. In this contribution, we experimentally realize a form of quantum correlation that exists even in the absence of entanglement and discord. We certify the presence of such quantum correlations via negativities in the regularized two-mode Glauber-Sudarshan function. Our data show compatibility with an incoherent mixture of orthonormal photon-number states, ruling out quantum coherence and other kinds of quantum resources. By construction, the quantumness of our state is robust against dephasing, thus requiring fewer experimental resources to ensure stability. In addition, we theoretically show how multimode entanglement can be activated based on the generated, nonentangled state. Therefore, we implement a robust kind of nonclassical photon-photon correlated state with useful applications in quantum information processing.

TI Enhancing quantum discord in v-shaped plasmonic waveguides by quantum
   feedback
SO PHYSICA SCRIPTA
AB We investigate the impact of a symmetric quantum feedback control on the quantum discord of the X state in V-shaped plasmonic waveguides. Under this feedback, the quantum discord of the Werner state is enhanced from 0 to 0.38. This value even continues to rise after reducing the decay rate of the atoms. Furthermore, we get the operational mechanism of feedback control through the evolution of the matrix elements. It confines the initial 4 x 4 matrix into a 3 x 3 subspace. As a result, the weights of each ground state in the quantum state change, which suppresses the degradation of Bell state. Lastly, we propose a direction for suggesting an improved feedback Hamiltonian.

TI Tripartite all-optical quantum steering swapping based on four-wave
   mixing process
SO ACTA PHYSICA SINICA
AB Quantum resource swapping is crucial for establishing quantum networks and achieving efficient quantum communication and it allows quantum resources to be shared and allocated between nodes in a quantum network, thereby enhancing network flexibility and quantum information processing capabilities. Quantum steering is a special type of quantum correlation that exhibits unique asymmetry compared with quantum entanglement and Bell nonlocality. This asymmetry enables quantum steering swapping to establish one-way or two-way asymmetry quantum steering between two independent optical modes, which is crucial for constructing asymmetric quantum networks. In this work, an all-optical quantum steering swapping scheme is proposed based on tripartite entangled state and bipartite entangled state. The all-optical scheme does not involve optic-electro conversion nor electro-optic conversion, but utilizes a low-noise, high-bandwidth four-wave mixing process to achieve the function of Bell state measurement in traditional schemes without measurement. After the steering swapping operation, the two originally independent entangled states without direct interaction generate quantum steering. In this work, two swapping schemes in the four-wave mixing processes, combined with linear beam splitter and nonlinear beam splitter, are investigated. By analyzing the steering characteristics of the output modes, both schemes exhibit varieties of multipartite steering types. By adjusting the transmissivity of the linear beam splitter and the gain of the four-wave mixing process, the steering relationship can be flexibly manipulated to achieve one-way and two-way asymmetry steering. This provides new possibilities for one-way quantum communication and quantum information processing, making the utilization of quantum resources more efficient and controllable. Through in-depth analysis of the steering characteristics after swapping, it is found that compared with the linear beam splitter scheme, the nonlinear beam splitter scheme not only significantly improves the capability of quantum steering, but also allows for more flexible manipulation of monogamy relations of quantum steering. By optimizing the gain parameters of the nonlinear beam splitter, the precise manipulation of the monogamy relations can be achieved over a wider range. This not only expands broader application prospects for information processing and quantum communication in quantum networks, but also lays an important foundation for building efficient and secure quantum information processing systems.

TI Engineering Four-Qubit Fuel States for Protecting Quantum Thermalization
   Machine from Decoherence
SO INFORMATION
AB Decoherence is a major issue in quantum information processing, degrading the performance of tasks or even precluding them. Quantum error-correcting codes, creating decoherence-free subspaces, and the quantum Zeno effect are among the major means for protecting quantum systems from decoherence. Increasing the number of qubits of a quantum system to be utilized in a quantum information task as a resource expands the quantum state space. This creates the opportunity to engineer the quantum state of the system in a way that improves the performance of the task and even to protect the system against decoherence. Here, we consider a quantum thermalization machine and four-qubit atomic states as its resource. Taking into account the realistic conditions such as cavity loss and atomic decoherence due to ambient temperature, we design a quantum state for the atomic resource as a classical mixture of Dicke and W states. We show that using the mixture probability as the control parameter, the negative effects of the inevitable decoherence on the machine performance almost vanish. Our work paves the way for optimizing resource systems consisting of a higher number of atoms.

TI Entanglement and Non-Locality in Quantum Protocols with Identical
   Particles
SO ENTROPY
AB We study the role of entanglement and non-locality in quantum protocols that make use of systems of identical particles. Unlike in the case of distinguishable particles, the notions of entanglement and non-locality for systems whose constituents cannot be distinguished and singly addressed are still debated. We clarify why the only approach that avoids incongruities and paradoxes is the one based on the second quantization formalism, whereby it is the entanglement of the modes that can be populated by the particles that really matters and not the particles themselves. Indeed, by means of a metrological and of a teleportation protocol, we show that inconsistencies arise in formulations that force entanglement and non-locality to be properties of the identical particles rather than of the modes they can occupy. The reason resides in the fact that orthogonal modes can always be addressed while identical particles cannot.

TI Subspace preserving quantum convolutional neural network architectures
SO QUANTUM SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB Subspace preserving quantum circuits are a class of quantum algorithms that, relying on some symmetries in the computation, can offer theoretical guarantees for their training. Those algorithms have gained extensive interest as they can offer polynomial speed-up and can be used to mimic classical machine learning algorithms. In this work, we propose a novel convolutional neural network architecture model based on Hamming weight (HW) preserving quantum circuits. In particular, we introduce convolutional layers, and measurement based pooling layers that preserve the symmetries of the quantum states while realizing non-linearity using gates that are not subspace preserving. Our proposal offers significant polynomial running time advantages over classical deep-learning architecture. We provide an open source simulation library for HW preserving quantum circuits that can simulate our techniques more efficiently with GPU-oriented libraries. Using this code, we provide examples of architectures that highlight great performances on complex image classification tasks with a limited number of qubits, and with fewer parameters than classical deep-learning architectures.

TI Sum Uncertainty Relations: Uncertainty Regions for Qubits and Qutrits
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF THEORETICAL PHYSICS
AB We investigate the notion of uncertainty region using the variance based sum uncertainty relation for qubits and qutrits. We compare uncertainty region of the qubit (a 2-level system) with that of the qutrit (3-level system) by considering sum uncertainty relation for two non-commuting Pauli-like observables, acting on the two dimensional qubit Hilbert space. We identify that physically valid uncertainty region of a qubit is smaller than that of a qutrit. This implies that an enhanced precision can be achieved in the measurement of incompatible Pauli-like observables acting on the 2-dimensional subspace of a qutrit Hilbert space. We discuss the implication of the reduced uncertainties in the steady states of ?, V, Xi types of 3-level atomic systems. Furthermore, we construct a two-qubit permutation symmetric state, corresponding to a 3-level system and show that the reduction in the sum uncertainty value - or equivalently, increased uncertainty region of a qutrit system - is a consequence of quantum entanglement in the two-qubit system. Our results suggest that uncertainty region can be used as a dimensional witness.

TI Efficient quantum simulation of nonlinear interactions using SNAP and

SO QUANTUM SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB Quantum simulations provide means to probe challenging problems within controllable quantum systems. However, implementing or simulating deep-strong nonlinear couplings between bosonic oscillators on physical platforms remains a challenge. We present a deterministic simulation technique that efficiently and accurately models nonlinear bosonic dynamics. This technique alternates between tunable Rabi and SNAP gates, both of which are available on experimental platforms such as trapped ions and superconducting circuits. Our proposed simulation method facilitates high-fidelity modeling of phenomena that emerge from higher-order bosonic interactions, with an exponential reduction in resource usage compared to other techniques. We demonstrate the potential of our technique by accurately reproducing key phenomena and other distinctive characteristics of ideal nonlinear optomechanical systems. Our technique serves as a valuable tool for simulating complex quantum interactions, simultaneously paving the way for new capabilities in quantum computing through the use of hybrid qubit-oscillator systems.

SO NPJ QUANTUM INFORMATION
AB Quantum photonic technologies, such as quantum key distribution, are already benefiting greatly from the rise of integrated photonics. However, the flexibility in design of these systems is often restricted by the properties of the integration material platforms. Here, we overcome this choice by using hybrid integration of ultra-low-loss silicon nitride waveguides with indium phosphide electro-optic modulators to produce high-performance quantum key distribution transceiver chips. Access to the best properties of both materials allows us to achieve active encoding and decoding of photonic qubits on-chip at GHz speeds and with sub-1% quantum bit error rates over long fibre distances. We demonstrate bidirectional secure bit rates of 1.82 Mbps over 10 dB channel attenuation and positive secure key rates out to 250 km of fibre. The results support the imminent utility of hybrid integration for quantum photonic circuits and the wider field of photonics.

TI Post-Quantum and Code-Based Cryptography-Some Prospective Research
   Directions
SO CRYPTOGRAPHY
AB Cryptography has been used from time immemorial for preserving the confidentiality of data/information in storage or transit. Thus, cryptography research has also been evolving from the classical Caesar cipher to the modern cryptosystems, based on modular arithmetic to the contemporary cryptosystems based on quantum computing. The emergence of quantum computing poses a major threat to the modern cryptosystems based on modular arithmetic, whereby even the computationally hard problems which constitute the strength of the modular arithmetic ciphers could be solved in polynomial time. This threat triggered post-quantum cryptography research to design and develop post-quantum algorithms that can withstand quantum computing attacks. This paper provides an overview of the various research directions that have been explored in post-quantum cryptography and, specifically, the various code-based cryptography research dimensions that have been explored. Some potential research directions that are yet to be explored in code-based cryptography research from the perspective of codes is a key contribution of this paper.

Our algorithm first deter-mines a suitable, fixed tree structure adapted to the expected entanglement generated by the quantum circuit. The gates are sequentially applied to the tree by absorbing single-qubit gates into leaf nodes, splitting two-qubit gates via singular value decomposition and thread-ing the resulting virtual bond through the tree. We theoretically analyze the applicability of the method as well as its computational cost and memory requirements and identify advan-tageous scenarios in terms of required bond dimensions as compared to a matrix product state representation. The study is comple-mented by numerical experiments for different quantum circuit layouts up to 37 qubits.

TI Quantifying the performance of bidirectional quantum teleportation
SO CANADIAN JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB Bidirectional teleportation is a fundamental protocol for exchanging quantum information between two parties by means of a shared resource state and local operations and classical communication (LOCC). In this paper, we develop two seemingly different ways of quantifying the simulation error of unideal bidirectional teleportation by means of the normalized diamond distance and the channel infidelity, and we prove that they are equivalent. By relaxing the set of operations allowed from LOCC to those that completely preserve the positivity of the partial transpose, we obtain semi-definite programming lower bounds on the simulation error of unideal bidirectional teleportation. We evaluate these bounds for several key examples: when there is no resource state at all and for isotropic and Werner states, in each case finding an analytical solution. The first aforementioned example establishes a benchmark for classical versus quantum bidirectional teleportation. Another example consists of a resource state resulting from the action of a generalized amplitude damping channel on two Bell states, for which we find an analytical expression for the simulation error that is in agreement with numerical estimates (up to numerical precision). We then evaluate the performance of some schemes for bidirectional teleportation due to (Kiktenko et al., Phys. Rev. A 93, 062305 (2016)) and find that they are suboptimal and do not go beyond the aforementioned classical limit for bidirectional teleportation. We offer a scheme alternative to theirs that is provably optimal. Finally, we generalize the whole development to the setting of bidirectional controlled teleportation, in which there is an additional assisting party who helps with the exchange of quantum information, and we establish semi-definite programming lower bounds on the simulation error for this task. More generally, we provide semi-definite programming lower bounds on the performance of bipartite and multipartite channel simulation using a shared resource state and LOCC.

TI Error-resilient Floquet geometric quantum computation
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB We propose a geometric quantum computation (GQC) scheme, called Floquet GQC (FGQC), where error-resilient geometric gates based on periodically driven two-level systems can be constructed via a non-Abelian geometric phase proposed in a recent study [V. Novicenko and G. Juzeliunas, Phys. Rev. A 100, 012127 (2019)]. Based on Rydberg atoms, we give possible implementations of universal FGQC single-qubit gates and a nontrivial FGQC two-qubit gate. By using numerical simulation, we evaluate the performance of the FGQC Z and X gates in the presence of both decoherence and a certain kind of systematic control error. For the currently available coherence time of the Rydberg state, T-2 approximate to 32 mu s, the numerical results show that the X and Z gate fidelities are about 0.900 and 0.899, respectively. In addition, we find that FGQC is robust against global control error; both analytical demonstration and numerical evidence are given. As the coherence time of various qubits grows, FGQC may provide a promising error-resilient quantum computation scheme in the future.

TI Recurrent neural network decoding of rotated surface codes based on
   distributed strategy
SO CHINESE PHYSICS B
AB Quantum error correction is a crucial technology for realizing quantum computers. These computers achieve fault-tolerant quantum computing by detecting and correcting errors using decoding algorithms. Quantum error correction using neural network-based machine learning methods is a promising approach that is adapted to physical systems without the need to build noise models. In this paper, we use a distributed decoding strategy, which effectively alleviates the problem of exponential growth of the training set required for neural networks as the code distance of quantum error-correcting codes increases. Our decoding algorithm is based on renormalization group decoding and recurrent neural network decoder. The recurrent neural network is trained through the ResNet architecture to improve its decoding accuracy. Then we test the decoding performance of our distributed strategy decoder, recurrent neural network decoder, and the classic minimum weight perfect matching (MWPM) decoder for rotated surface codes with different code distances under the circuit noise model, the thresholds of these three decoders are about 0.0052, 0.0051, and 0.0049, respectively. Our results demonstrate that the distributed strategy decoder outperforms the other two decoders, achieving approximately a 5% improvement in decoding efficiency compared to the MWPM decoder and approximately a 2% improvement compared to the recurrent neural network decoder.

TI Quantum circuit architecture search for variational quantum algorithms
SO NPJ QUANTUM INFORMATION
AB Variational quantum algorithms (VQAs) are expected to be a path to quantum advantages on noisy intermediate-scale quantum devices. However, both empirical and theoretical results exhibit that the deployed ansatz heavily affects the performance of VQAs such that an ansatz with a larger number of quantum gates enables a stronger expressivity, while the accumulated noise may render a poor trainability. To maximally improve the robustness and trainability of VQAs, here we devise a resource and runtime efficient scheme termed quantum architecture search (QAS). In particular, given a learning task, QAS automatically seeks a near-optimal ansatz (i.e., circuit architecture) to balance benefits and side-effects brought by adding more noisy quantum gates to achieve a good performance. We implement QAS on both the numerical simulator and real quantum hardware, via the IBM cloud, to accomplish data classification and quantum chemistry tasks. In the problems studied, numerical and experimental results show that QAS cannot only alleviate the influence of quantum noise and barren plateaus but also outperforms VQAs with pre-selected ansatze.

TI Computational turbulent combustion in the age of artificial intelligence
   and quantum information
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICS AND PHYSICS
AB The impact of high-performance computing on the society has been enormous, but it is easy to be taken for granted. In today's world, it is virtually impossible to imagine system design or major decision making not aided via predictive modeling and simulation. Now that we are experiencing the Data Revolution and the emergence of the Second Quantum Revolution, it is wise to consider both of these elements in computational science and engineering. Data-driven modeling approaches and demonstrated speed-ups of quantum algorithms have the potential to transform scientific discovery. This will affect the fabrics of industrialized societies in diverse disciplines. A research arena which can substantially benefit from these technologies is combustion. This field has been the subject of heavy computational research for many decades now. In this review, some examples taken from the previous works of the author are presented to demonstrate how the field of computational turbulent combustion is benefiting from modern developments in machine learning (ML) and quantum computing (QC).

TI Quantum network recovery from multinode failure using network encoding
   with GHZ states on higher-order butterfly networks
SO QUANTUM INFORMATION PROCESSING
AB We propose a protocol to transmit three quantum states crossly in a butterfly network with prior entanglement, in the form of GHZ states, between three senders. The proposed protocol requires only one qubit transmission or two classical bits transmission in each channel of the network. We generalise this protocol to higher number of qubits with multiqubit GHZ states towards quantum network operability using network coding with multiqubit GHZ states on higher-order butterfly networks.
   Quantum correlations, particularly prior entanglement across quantum states, can be harnessed for transmitting more classical information through quantum communication links through teleportation and superdense coding schemes [1-5]. The physical realisation of quantum networked systems at atomic scale distances using such entangled quantum states is key towards realising high-throughput quantum communications at such scales. The ideas from classical network coding, such as coding over butterfly networks, can be naturally extended to the quantum case, mindful of the quantum no-go theorems [6,7]. In the butterfly network, two units of information can be sent crossly and the channels can transmit only one bit, with the bottleneck being the central channel in the network.

TI All-quantum mode-adaptable communication processors: mathematical
   frameworks
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB The rapid expansion and diversity of quantum communication protocols are accelerating the development of the Quantum Internet-a global network interconnecting heterogeneous quantum communication nodes and systems. A key challenge in this effort is achieving all-quantum mode adaptation, which is essential for enabling interoperability among quantum nodes and enhancing the efficiency and scalability of quantum information transmission. This paper introduces a mathematical framework for all-quantum mode adaptation, centered on three core mechanisms: mode expansion, mode reduction, and mode mapping. These processes are fundamental to managing compatibility across different quantum signal encodings. By leveraging multiple degrees of freedom (DoFs) of photons, such as time, path, and polarization, we demonstrate the feasibility of mode-adaptable all-quantum processors capable of dynamically interfacing with varied quantum communication environments. Our results address critical real-world challenges in building a flexible, scalable, and interoperable Quantum Internet, laying a basis for architecture-level integration of heterogeneous quantum technologies.

TI Inverse iteration quantum eigensolvers assisted with a continuous
   variable
SO QUANTUM SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB The capacity for solving eigenstates with a quantum computer is key for ultimately simulating physical systems. Here we propose inverse iteration quantum eigensolvers, which exploit the power of quantum computing for the classical inverse power iteration method. A key ingredient is constructing an inverse Hamiltonian as a linear combination of coherent Hamiltonian evolution. We first consider a continuous-variable quantum mode (qumode) for realizing such a linear combination as an integral, with weights being encoded into a qumode resource state. We demonstrate the quantum algorithm with numerical simulations under finite squeezing for various physical systems, including molecules and quantum many-body models. We also discuss a hybrid quantum-classical algorithm that directly sums up Hamiltonian evolution with different durations for comparison. It is revealed that continuous-variable resources are valuable for reducing the coherent evolution time of Hamiltonians in quantum algorithms.

TI A fault-tolerant neutral-atom architecture for universal quantum
   computation
SO NATURE
AB Quantum error correction (QEC)1,2 is essential for the realization of large-scale quantum computers3,4. However, owing to the complexity of operating on the encoded 'logical' qubits5,6, understanding the physical principles for building fault-tolerant quantum devices and combining them into efficient architectures is an outstanding scientific challenge. Here we use reconfigurable arrays of up to 448 neutral atoms to implement the key elements of a universal, fault-tolerant quantum processing architecture and experimentally explore their underlying working mechanisms. We first use surface codes to study how repeated QEC suppresses errors6,7, demonstrating 2.14(13)x below-threshold performance in a four-round characterization circuit by leveraging atom loss detection and machine learning decoding8,9. We then investigate logical entanglement using transversal gates and lattice surgery10, 11-12 and extend it to universal logic through transversal teleportation with three-dimensional [[15,1,3]] codes13,14, enabling arbitrary-angle synthesis with polylogarithmic overhead5,15. Finally, we develop mid-circuit qubit reuse16, increasing experimental cycle rates by two orders of magnitude and enabling deep-circuit protocols with dozens of logical qubits and hundreds of logical teleportations17, 18, 19-20 with [[7,1,3]] and high-rate [[16,6,4]] codes while maintaining constant internal entropy. Our experiments show key principles for efficient architecture design, involving the interplay between quantum logic and entropy removal, judiciously using physical entanglement in logic gates and magic state generation, and leveraging teleportations for universality and physical qubit reset. These results establish foundations for scalable, universal error-corrected processing and its practical implementation in neutral atom systems.

TI High-dynamic-range quantum sensing of magnons and their dynamics using a
   superconducting qubit
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW APPLIED
AB Magnons, the quanta of collective spin excitations in magnetic materials, may enable functionalities, such as nonreciprocity and transduction in hybrid quantum devices. To assess the potential of such applications, it is necessary to understand magnon dynamics beyond the simple harmonic oscillator regime, where theory predicts effects like population-dependent damping and quantum fluctuations in the form of magnon shot noise. Probing these phenomena requires sensors with high sensitivity and the ability to resolve magnon properties across different excitation regimes. Here, we demonstrate accurate and sensitive detection of magnon population and decay over a wide range of occupation numbers. We use a superconducting qubit to probe magnons in a ferrimagnet over approximately 2000 excitations. Using qubit control and parametrically induced qubit-magnon interactions, we demonstrate few-excitation sensitive detection of magnons with a dynamic range of approximately 30 dB, and are able to accurately resolve their decay with few-ns sensitivity. These capabilities offer a powerful and practical technique for probing magnon dynamics in or beyond the linear regime over a wide range of excitations.

TI Decoherence-Aware Entangling and Swapping Strategy Optimization for
   Entanglement Routing in Quantum Networks
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON NETWORKING
AB Quantum teleportation enables high-security communications through end-to-end quantum entangled pairs. End-to-end entangled pairs are created by using swapping processes to consume short entangled pairs and generate long pairs. However, due to environmental interference, entangled pairs decohere over time, resulting in low fidelity. Thus, generating entangled pairs at the right time is crucial. Moreover, the swapping process also causes additional fidelity loss. To this end, this paper presents a short time slot protocol, where a time slot can only accommodate a process. It has a more flexible arrangement of entangling and swapping processes than the traditional long time slot protocol. It raises a new optimization problem TETRIS for finding strategies of entangling and swapping for each request to maximize the fidelity sum of all accepted requests. To solve the TETRIS, we design two novel algorithms with different optimization techniques. Finally, the simulation results manifest that our algorithms can outperform the existing methods by up to $60\sim 78\%$ in general, and by $20\sim 75\%$ even under low entangling probabilities.

TI Utilizing quantum algorithms to achieve carbon neutrality in urban
   areas: A systematic review
SO ALEXANDRIA ENGINEERING JOURNAL
AB In the face of climate change, urban areas, as major sources of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, are pivotal in mitigation efforts. Cities worldwide are striving to achieve carbon neutrality, aligning with the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Quantum computing (QC), with its ability to leverage qubits and surpass the limitations of classical computing, presents a promising avenue for optimizing processes in energy, transportation, and climate change mitigation. This study conducts a systematic literature review following Kitchenham's framework, analyzing 96 out of 3397 articles from four major academic databases. The review focuses on the implementation of quantum algorithms, including pure quantum algorithms (PQA), hybrid quantum-classical algorithms (HQC), and quantum-inspired classical algorithms (QIC), with 40 distinct methods such as Quantum Annealing (QA), Quantum-inspired Particle Swarm Optimization (QiPSO), and Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA). The analysis identifies key application domains: algorithmic tasks, types of implications, GHG emission sectors, and quantum methods, highlighting allocation and routing tasks as dominant themes. Notably, the transportation and energy sectors, along with the QA method, feature prominently. Furthermore, a detailed nexus analysis reveals significant interconnections between algorithmic tasks, quantum methods, and their practical implications, particularly in energy efficiency and resource allocation. The findings underscore the growing role of quantum algorithms in reducing urban GHG emissions and advancing toward carbon neutrality, showcasing QC's potential in supporting sustainable cities and effective climate action.

AB Adders are one of the most interesting circuits in quantum computing due to their use in major algorithms that benefit from the special characteristics of this type of computation. Among these algorithms, Shor's algorithm stands out, which allows decomposing numbers in a time exponentially lower than the time needed to do it with classical computation. In this work, we propose three fault-tolerant carry lookahead adders that improve the cost in terms of quantum gates and qubits with respect to the rest of quantum circuits available in the literature. Their optimal implementation in a real quantum computer is also presented. Finally, the work ends with a rigorous comparison where the advantages and disadvantages of the proposed circuits against the rest of the circuits of the state of the art are exposed. Moreover, the information obtained from such a comparison is summarized in tables that allow a quick consultation to interested researchers.

TI Variational quantum Hamiltonian engineering
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Estimating the expectation value of a Hamiltonian and performing a Hamiltonian simulation are two fundamental tasks in quantum computation, with their efficiency heavily dependent on the Pauli norm of the Hamiltonian, which sums the absolute values of its Pauli coefficients. In this work, we propose a variational quantum algorithm called variational quantum Hamiltonian engineering (VQHE) to minimize the Pauli norm of a Hamiltonian, thereby reducing the overhead for expectation value estimation and Hamiltonian simulation. We first develop a theoretical framework that transforms the Pauli norm minimization problem into a vector l1-norm minimization problem. We then design an appropriate cost function and employ parametrized quantum circuits to variationally minimize this cost function. Numerical experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of VQHE in reducing the Pauli norm for both the Ising Hamiltonian and molecular Hamiltonians. Furthermore, we show that VQHE is compatible with grouping strategies, enabling further reductions in measurement complexity for expectation value estimation. Our results highlight the potential of VQHE to enhance the efficiency of quantum algorithms in near-term quantum devices, offering a promising approach for practical quantum computing applications.

TI Quantum state protection from finite-temperature thermal noise with
   application to controlled quantum teleportation
SO CHINESE PHYSICS B
AB We propose a quantum state protection scheme via quantum feedforward control combined with environment-assisted measurement to protect arbitrary unknown initial states from the finite-temperature thermal noise (FTTN). The main strategy is to transfer the quantum system to a noise-robust state by weak measurement and feedforward control before the noise channel. Then we apply the environment-assisted measurement on the noise channel to select our desired damped states that are invertible to the initial state. After the noise channel, the reversal operations are applied to restore the initial state. We consider the protection of a single-qubit system, derive the analytical expressions of the success probability and the fidelity, and analyze the influence of key parameters on the performance of the proposed scheme. Unlike previous studies, there is no trade-off between the fidelity and the success probability in the proposed scheme; hence one could maximize them separately. Simulation results show that the proposed scheme can greatly improve the fidelity of the quantum state with a certain success probability. Moreover, the proposed scheme is successfully applied to improving the fidelity of controlled quantum teleportation through two independent FTTN channels from the perspective of protecting the shared entanglement.

AB Practical quantum computing is rapidly becoming a reality. To harness quantum computers' real potential in software applications, one needs to have an in-depth understanding of all such characteristics of quantum computing platforms (QCPs), relevant from the Software Engineering (SE) perspective. Restrictions on copying, deletion, the transmission of qubit states, a hard dependency on quantum algorithms are few, out of many, examples of QCP characteristics that have significant implications for building quantum software.
   Thus, developing quantum software requires a paradigm shift in thinking by software engineers. This paper presents the key findings from the SE perspective, resulting from an in-depth examination of state-of-the-art QCPs available today. The main contributions that we present include i) Proposing a general architecture of the QCPs, ii) Proposing a programming model for developing quantum software, iii) Determining architecturally significant characteristics of QCPs, and iv) Determining the impact of these characteristics on various Quality Attributes (QAs) and Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) activities.
   We show that the nature of QCPs makes them useful mainly in specialized application areas such as scientific computing. Except for performance and scalability, most of the other QAs (e.g., maintainability, testability, and reliability) are adversely affected by different characteristics of a QCP.

TI Fabrication of low-loss Josephson parametric devices
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
AB Superconducting circuits incorporating Josephson elements represent a promising hardware platform for quantum technologies. Potential applications include scalable quantum computing, microwave quantum networks, and quantum-limited amplifiers. However, progress in Josephson junction-based quantum technologies is facing the ongoing challenge of minimizing loss channels. This is also true for parametric superconducting devices based on nonlinear Josephson resonators. In this work, we report on the fabrication and characterization of low-loss Josephson parametric devices operated in the GHz frequency range, showing record internal quality factors. Specifically, we achieve internal quality factors Qintsignificantly exceeding 105 for both Josephson parametric converters and Josephson parametric amplifiers in the single-photon regime by fitting the scattering data. We confirm the extracted Qintvalues by analyzing purity of squeezed vacuum states generated by these devices. These low-loss devices mark a significant step forward in realizing high-performance quantum circuits, enabling further advancements in superconducting quantum technologies.

TI Geometric quantum discord signals non-factorization

AB We propose the information-theoretic quantity of geometric quantum discord (GQD) as an indicator of the factorization properties of a given quantum system. In particular, we show how non-vanishing discord implies that the corresponding partition function does not factorize, both for generic pure states and the thermofield double state as a state with a known geometric dual in light of the AdS/CFT correspondence. Via this analysis, we give a novel interpretation to the thermomixed double state as the best purely classical approximation of the Einstein-Rosen bridge.

TI Boosting quantum annealing performance through direct polynomial
   unconstrained binary optimization
SO QUANTUM SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB Quantum annealing aims at solving optimization problems of practical relevance using quantum-computing hardware. Problems of interest are typically formulated in terms of quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO) Hamiltonians. However, many optimization problems are much more naturally formulated in terms of polynomial unconstrained binary optimization (PUBO) functions of higher order. As we show with various problem examples, leveraging the PUBO formulation can bring considerable savings in terms of required number of qubits. Moreover, in numerical benchmarks for the paradigmatic 3-SAT problem, we find scenarios where the scaling of the minimum energy gap during the optimization sweep differs significantly, suggesting the possibility of an exponentially faster annealing time when using the PUBO as compared to the QUBO formulation. This advantage persists even when considering the overhead caused by the higher-order interactions necessary for PUBO cost Hamiltonians. As an interesting side effect, the analysis on minimum energy gaps of different 3-SAT instance generators reveals different degrees of hardness, which will be of interest also for classical benchmark calculations. Our findings show a promising path to improving the resource efficiency and sweeping speed of quantum annealing protocols on both analog and digital platforms, which are important prerequisites when aiming at solving larger optimization problems with relevance to industry.

TI Pointing Model for Vehicular Quantum Communication Terminals Based on
   Line-of-Sight Attitude Measurement
SO IEEE PHOTONICS JOURNAL
AB Vehicular quantum communication terminals (VQCTs) are crucial for establishing global-scale quantum networks. High-precision line-of-sight (LOS) pointing is essential for fast and reliable acquisition in satellite-based quantum key distribution (QKD). The pointing accuracy of VQCTs is affected by attitude measurement errors, mechanical structure errors, and structural instability errors resulting from platform movement. By mounting attitude sensors on the LOS of VQCTs, we directly measure the LOS attitude. This completely eliminates the impact of mechanical structure errors and structural instability errors on pointing accuracy. Furthermore, we propose a line-of-pointing calibration method and a pointing model for VQCTs based on LOS attitude measurement. The pointing accuracy of this model is primarily reliant on the accuracy of attitude sensors. Two experiments were conducted to validate the effectiveness of our model. One is the star pointing experiment, comparing with the existing pointing model for VQCTs, our model significantly reduces the pointing errors by 93%, from 1296 '' to 87.8 ''. This substantiates that our model eliminates mechanical structure errors and structural instability errors. Another is the successful acquisition of a quantum communication satellite, which demonstrates the feasibility of the proposed model for implementing the satellite-to-motion platform QKD and global-scale quantum networks.

TI Training Gaussian boson sampling by quantum machine learning
SO QUANTUM MACHINE INTELLIGENCE
AB We use neural networks to represent the characteristic function of many-body Gaussian states in the quantum phase space. By a pullback mechanism, we model transformations due to unitary operators as linear layers that can be cascaded to simulate complex multi-particle processes. We use the layered neural networks for non-classical light propagation in random interferometers, and compute boson pattern probabilities by automatic differentiation. This is a viable strategy for training Gaussian boson sampling. We demonstrate that multi-particle events in Gaussian boson sampling can be optimized by a proper design and training of the neural network weights. The results are potentially useful to the creation of new sources and complex circuits for quantum technologies.

TI Power Theft Detection in Smart Grids Using Quantum Machine Learning
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB Electricity theft can lead to enormous economic losses and cause operational and security problems for electricity networks and utilities. Most current research has focused on electricity theft detection in the consumption sector. However, the high penetration rate of distributed generation (DG) can lead to an increase in power theft attacks in this sector via smart meter manipulation. This study is an extension of prior works focused on electricity theft detection in the consumption and generation domains of a smart grid environment with DG. This study proposes a novel electricity theft detection framework based on quantum machine learning (QML). The elegant field of QML has been used to demonstrate that data classification becomes more efficient in higher-dimensional spaces. An extensive numerical study was conducted to determine the type of QML architecture that can perform well and efficiently in electricity theft detection cases. The technique presented here has not yet been extensively studied in the domain of energy theft detection. Extensive experiments were conducted to assess this approach, and an accuracy of 0.87 was achieved with respect to the classical consumption domain, whereas an accuracy of 0.977 was achieved with respect to the net metering domain.

TI Quantum annealing feature selection on light-weight medical image
   datasets
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB We investigate the use of quantum computing algorithms on real quantum hardware to tackle the computationally intensive task of feature selection for light-weight medical image datasets. Feature selection is often formulated as a k of n selection problem, where the complexity grows binomially with increasing k and n. Quantum computers, particularly quantum annealers, are well-suited for such problems, which may offer advantages under certain problem formulations. We present a method to solve larger feature selection instances than previously demonstrated on commercial quantum annealers. Our approach combines a linear Ising penalty mechanism with subsampling and thresholding techniques to enhance scalability. The method is tested in a toy problem where feature selection identifies pixel masks used to reconstruct small-scale medical images. We compare our approach against a range of feature selection strategies, including randomized baselines, classical supervised and unsupervised methods, combinatorial optimization via classical and quantum solvers, and learning-based feature representations. The results indicate that quantum annealing-based feature selection is effective for this simplified use case, demonstrating its potential in high-dimensional optimization tasks. However, its applicability to broader, real-world problems remains uncertain, given the current limitations of quantum computing hardware. While learned feature representations such as autoencoders achieve superior reconstruction performance, they do not offer the same level of interpretability or direct control over input feature selection as our approach.

TI Towards Explainable Quantum Machine Learning for Mobile Malware
   Detection and Classification
SO APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL
AB Through the years, the market for mobile devices has been rapidly increasing, and as a result of this trend, mobile malware has become sophisticated. Researchers are focused on the design and development of malware detection systems to strengthen the security and integrity of sensitive and private information. In this context, deep learning is exploited, also in cybersecurity, showing the ability to build models aimed at detecting whether an application is Trusted or malicious. Recently, with the introduction of quantum computing, we have been witnessing the introduction of quantum algorithms in Machine Learning. In this paper, we provide a comparison between five state-of-the-art Convolutional Neural Network models (i.e., AlexNet, MobileNet, EfficientNet, VGG16, and VGG19), one network developed by the authors (called Standard-CNN), and two quantum models (i.e., a hybrid quantum model and a fully quantum neural network) to classify malware. In addition to the classification, we provide explainability behind the model predictions, by adopting the Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping to highlight the areas of the image obtained from the application symptomatic of a certain prediction, to the convolutional and to the quantum models obtaining the best performances in Android malware detection. Real-world experiments were performed on a dataset composed of 8446 Android malicious and legitimate applications, obtaining interesting results.

The ASIC architecture employs in-memory computing with memristor crossbars for efficient vector-matrix multiplications (VMM). The ASIC decoder architecture includes an input layer implemented with a VMM and an analog sigmoid activation function, a recurrent layer with analog memory, and an output layer with a VMM and a threshold activation function. Cryogenic characterization of the ASIC is conducted, demonstrating its performance at both room temperature and cryogenic temperatures down to 1.2K. Results indicate stable activation function shapes and pulse responses at cryogenic temperatures. Moreover, power consumption measurements reveal consistent behavior at room and cryogenic temperatures. Overall, this study lays the foundation for developing efficient and scalable neural decoders for quantum error correction in cryogenic environments.

TI Exploring quantum correlations of two-qubit Heisenberg chain model
   influenced by magnetic dipole-dipole, magnetic field, and a symmetric
   cross interaction
SO QUANTUM INFORMATION PROCESSING
AB The concepts of concurrence, 3-steerability, and Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt (CHSH) inequality are employed to investigate the environmental impacts on the quantum correlations of the two-spin-1/2 Heisenberg XYZ chain model. In particular, the effects of a homogeneous magnetic field, symmetric cross interaction, and dipole-dipole interaction on the entanglement, degree of steerability, and non-locality are discussed. Results show that the entanglement and steering phenomena are bounded by the non-locality for both positive and negative values of dipole-dipole coupling. It has also been observed that higher symmetric cross-interaction strengthens the quantum correlations, whereas the homogeneous magnetic field weakens the quantumness of the system. The findings indicate that a magnetic field normal to the magnetic dipole yields better quantum correlations than when they are parallel.

TI Resilient Entanglement Distribution in a Multihop Quantum Network

AB The evolution of quantum networking requires architectures capable of dynamically reconfigurable entanglement distribution to meet diverse user needs and ensure tolerance against transmission disruptions. We introduce multihop quantum networks to improve network reach and resilience by enabling quantum communications across intermediate nodes, thus broadening network connectivity and increasing scalability. We present multihop two-qubit polarization-entanglement distribution within a quantum network at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory campus. Our system uses wavelength-selective switches for adaptive bandwidth management on a software-defined quantum network that integrates a quantum data plane with classical data and control planes, creating a flexible, reconfigurable mesh. Our network distributes entanglement across six nodes within three subnetworks, each located in a separate building, optimizing quantum state fidelity and transmission rate through adaptive resource management. Additionally, we demonstrate the network's resilience by implementing a link recovery approach that monitors and reroutes quantum resources to maintain service continuity despite link failures-paving the way for scalable and reliable quantum networking infrastructures.

The procedure consists of an encoding phase where classical data are mapped on the surface of the qudit's Bloch hyper-sphere via rotation encoding, followed by a rotation of the sphere and a projective measurement. The rotation is adjustable in order to control the operator to be measured, while additional weights are introduced in the encoding phase adjusting the mapping on the Bloch's hyper-surface. During the training phase, a cost function based on the average expectation value of the observable is minimized using gradient descent thereby adjusting the weights. Using examples and performing a numerical estimation of lossless memory dimension, we demonstrate that this geometrically inspired qudit model for classification is able to solve nonlinear classification problems using a small number of parameters only and without requiring entangling operations.

AB We consider entanglement-assisted communication over the qubit depolarizing channel under the security requirement of covert communication, where the transmission itself must be concealed from detection by an adversary. Previous work showed that O(root n) information bits can be reliably and covertly transmitted in n channel uses without entanglement assistance. However, Gagatsos et al. (2020) showed that entanglement assistance can increase this scaling to O(root n log n) for continuous-variable bosonic channels. Here, we present a finite-dimensional parallel, and show that O(root n log n) covert bits can be transmitted reliably over n uses of a qubit depolarizing channel. The coding scheme employs "weakly" entangled states such that their squared amplitude scales as O(1/root n) .

AB Graphical languages, like quantum circuits or ZX-calculus, have been successfully designed to represent (memory-less) quantum computations acting on a finite number of qubits. Meanwhile, delayed traces have been used as a graphical way to represent finite-memory computations on streams, in a classical setting (cartesian data types). We merge those two approaches and describe a general construction that extends any graphical language, equipped with a notion of discarding, to a graphical language of finite memory computations. In order to handle cases like the ZX-calculus, which is complete for post-selected quantum mechanics, we extend the delayed trace formalism beyond the causal case, refining the notion of causality for stream transformers. We design a stream semantics based on stateful morphism sequences and, under some assumptions, show universality and completeness results. Finally, we investigate the links of our framework with previous works on cartesian data types, signal flow graphs, and quantum channels with memories.

TI Reinforcement learning approach for finding exchange-only gate sequences
   for CNOT with optimized gate time
SO EPJ QUANTUM TECHNOLOGY
AB Exchange-only quantum computation is a version of spin-based quantum computation that entirely avoids the difficulty of controlling individual spins by a magnetic field and instead functions by sequences of exchange pulses. The challenge for exchange-only quantum computation is to find short sequences that generate the required logical quantum gates. A reduction of the total gate time of such synthesized quantum gates can help to minimize the effects of decoherence and control errors during the gate operation and thus increase the total gate fidelity. We apply reinforcement learning to the optimization of exchange-gate sequences realizing the CNOT and CZ two-qubit gates which lend themselves to the construction of universal gate sets for quantum computation. We obtain a significant improvement regarding the total gate time compared to previously published results.

TI Quantum sensing of a coherent single spin excitation in a nuclear

SO NATURE PHYSICS
AB A single excitation in a semiconductor nuclear spin ensemble is detected with parts-per-million accuracy using the coupling between the ensemble and an electron-spin quantum dot.
   Accessing an ensemble of coherently interacting objects at the level of single quanta via a proxy qubit is transformative in the investigations of emergent quantum phenomena. An isolated nuclear spin ensemble is a remarkable platform owing to its coherence, but sensing its excitations with single spin precision has remained elusive. Here we achieve quantum sensing of a single nuclear-spin excitation (a nuclear magnon) in a dense ensemble of approximately 80,000 nuclei. A Ramsey measurement on the electron proxy qubit enables us to sense the hyperfine shift induced by a single nuclear magnon. We resolve multiple magnon modes distinguished by atomic species and spin polarity via the spectral dependence of this hyperfine shift. Finally, we observe the time-dependent shift induced by collective Rabi oscillations, revealing the competition between the buildup of quantum correlations and decoherence in the ensemble. These techniques could be extended to probe the engineered quantum states of the ensemble such as long-lived memory states.

TI The shape of higher-dimensional state space: Bloch-ball analog for a
   qutrit
SO QUANTUM
AB Geometric intuition is a crucial tool to obtain deeper insight into many concepts of physics. A paradigmatic example of its power is the Bloch ball, the geometrical representation for the state space of the simplest possible quantum system, a two-level system (or qubit). However, already for a three-level system (qutrit) the state space has eight dimensions, so that its complexity exceeds the grasp of our three-dimensional space of experience. This is unfortunate, given that the geometric object describing the state space of a qutrit has a much richer structure and is in many ways more representative for a general quantum system than a qubit. In this work we demonstrate that, based on the Bloch representation of quantum states, it is possible to construct a three dimensional model for the qutrit state space that captures most of the essential geometric features of the latter. Besides being of indisputable theoretical value, this opens the door to a new type of representation, thus extending our geometric intuition beyond the simplest quantum systems.

TI Investigating delay of the media access control protocols for IoT-RoF
   using quantum entanglement
SO IET NETWORKS
AB One of the significant challenges of the Radio over fibre (RoF) Medium Access Control (MAC) protocol is the propagation delay. This delay can lead to serious issues, such as higher propagation delay resulting in collisions and unnecessary retransmissions. Quantum entanglement is an excellent candidate to overcome the propagation delay of the RoF MAC protocol. A new quantum MAC protocol is proposed, named the Quantum Entanglement-based MAC protocol (QE-MAC), in which Quantum Teleportation is utilised to address the propagation delay. Four entanglement states are employed to represent the control packets of the classical MAC protocol, and data is transmitted over the classical channel. Instead of using control packets such as acknowledgement, request to send, and Clear to send, state transitions are employed. This approach avoids the delay and collision issues associated with control packets, resulting in a significant improvement in network performance. The delay, duty cycle (DC), and power consumption of the proposed QE-MAC protocol are formulated and derived. The protocol is evaluated in terms of delay, DC, and power consumption, demonstrating superior performance compared to the classical RoF MAC protocol. In comparison to published works, our proposed approach has successfully reduced both delay and power consumption by 35%.

TI Multimode squeezed state for reconfigurable quantum networks at
   telecommunication wavelengths
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Continuous variable encoding of quantum information requires the deterministic generation of highly correlated quantum states of light in the form of quantum networks, which, in turn, necessitates the controlled generation of a large number of squeezed modes. In this paper, we present an experimental source of multimode squeezed states of light at telecommunication wavelengths. Generation at such wavelengths is especially important as it can enable quantum information processing, communication, and sensing beyond the laboratory scale. We use a single-pass spontaneous parametric down-conversion process in a nonlinear waveguide pumped with the second harmonic of a femtosecond laser. Our measurements reveal significant squeezing in more than 21 frequency modes, with a maximum squeezing value exceeding 2.5 dB. We demonstrate multiparty entanglement by measuring the state's covariance matrix. Finally, we show the source reconfigurability by preparing few-node cluster states and measure their nullifier squeezing level. These results pave the way for a scalable implementation of continuous variable quantum information protocols at telecommunication wavelengths, particularly for multiparty, entanglement-based quantum communications. Moreover, the source is compatible with additional pulse-by-pulse multiplexing, which can be utilized to construct the necessary three-dimensional entangled structures for quantum computing protocols.

TI Constant-Overhead Quantum Error Correction with Thin Planar Connectivity
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB Quantum low density parity check (LDPC) codes may provide a path to build low-overhead fault-tolerant quantum computers. However, as general LDPC codes lack geometric constraints, naive layouts couple many distant qubits with crossing connections which could be hard to build in hardware and could result in performance-degrading crosstalk. We propose a 2D layout for quantum LDPC codes by decomposing their Tanner graphs into a small number of planar layers. Each layer contains long-range connections which do not cross. For any Calderbank-Shor-Steane code with a degree-delta Tanner graph, we design stabilizer measurement circuits with depth at most (2 delta + 2) using at most inverted right perpendicular delta/21inverted left perpendicular layers. We observe a circuit-noise threshold of 0.28% for a positive-rate code family using 49 physical qubits per logical qubit. For a physical error rate of 10(-4), this family reaches a logical error rate of 10(-15) using fourteen times fewer physical qubits than the surface code.

AB As quantum technologies advance, the security of popular cryptographic protocols becomes more threatened by the capabilities of Cryptographically Relevant Quantum Computers (CRQCs). In this scenario, Post -Quantum Cryptography (PQC) has become a potential solution to prolong the life of existing Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) systems. However, PQC protocols depend on high-quality randomness for key generation and encapsulation procedures, with the quality of the entropy source potentially having a profound impact on the security of the overall system. In this work, we demonstrate a proof-of-concept enabling the incorporation of Quantum Random Number Generation (QRNG) devices within communication networks using PQC-based Transport Layer Security (TLS).Using open source cryptographic libraries and commercial QRNG hardware, we demonstrate their use as entropy sources via an Entropy-as-a-Service (EaaS) model. We highlight two particular use cases: a fully virtualized private PKI network and a connection to an external PQC-enabled server. Experimental results show that EaaS QRNG enables real-time entropy monitoring and quality assessment in cryptographic management systems, with negligible impact on TLS handshake time.

TI Quantum logical controlled-NOT gate in a lithium niobate-on-insulator
   photonic quantum walk
SO QUANTUM SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB The two-qubit controlled-NOT gate is one of the central entangling operations in quantum information technology. The controlled-NOT gate for single photon qubits is normally realized as a network of five individual beamsplitters on six optical modes. Quantum walks (QWs) are an alternative photonic architecture involving arrays of coupled waveguides, which have been successful for investigating condensed matter physics, however, have not yet been applied to quantum logical operations. Here, we engineer the tight-binding Hamiltonian of an array of lithium niobate-on-insulator waveguides to experimentally demonstrate the two-qubit controlled-NOT gate in a QW. We measure the two-qubit transfer matrix with 0.938 +/- 0.003 fidelity, and we use the gate to generate entangled qubits with 0.945 +/- 0.002 fidelity by preparing the control photon in a superposition state. Our results highlight a new application for QWs that use a compact multi-mode interaction region to realize large multi-component quantum circuits.

TI Tapestry of dualities in decohered quantum error correction codes
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
AB Quantum error correction (QEC) codes protect quantum information from errors due to decoherence. Many of them also serve as prototypical models for exotic topological quantum matters. Investigating the behavior of the QEC codes under decoherence sheds light on not only the codes' robustness against errors but also new out-of-equilibrium quantum phases driven by decoherence. The phase transitions, including the error threshold, of the decohered QEC codes can be probed by the systems' R & eacute;nyi entropies SR with different R & eacute;nyi indices R. In this paper, we study the general construction of the statistical models that characterize the R & eacute;nyi entropies of QEC codes decohered by Pauli noise. We show that these statistical models can be organized into a "tapestry" woven by rich duality relations among them. For Calderbank-Shor-Steane (CSS) codes with bit-flip and phaseflip errors, we show that each R & eacute;nyi entropy is captured by a pair of dual statistical models with randomness. For R = 2, 3, infinity, there are additional dualities that map between the two error types, relating the critical bit-flip and phase-flip error rates of the decoherence-induced phase transitions in the CSS codes. For CSS codes with an "em symmetry" between the X-type and the Z-type stabilizers, the dualities with R = 2, 3, infinity become self-dualities with super-universal self-dual error rates. These self-dualities strongly constrain the phase transitions of the code signaled by SR=2,3,infinity. For general stabilizer codes decohered by generic Pauli noise, we also construct the statistical models that characterize the systems' entropies and obtain general duality relations between Pauli noise with different error rates.

TI Deep learning enhanced noise spectroscopy of a spin qubit environment
SO MACHINE LEARNING-SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB The undesired interaction of a quantum system with its environment generally leads to a coherence decay of superposition states in time. A precise knowledge of the spectral content of the noise induced by the environment is crucial to protect qubit coherence and optimize its employment in quantum device applications. We experimentally show that the use of neural networks (NNs) can highly increase the accuracy of noise spectroscopy, by reconstructing the power spectral density that characterizes an ensemble of carbon impurities around a nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center in diamond. NNs are trained over spin coherence functions of the NV center subjected to different Carr-Purcell sequences, typically used for dynamical decoupling (DD). As a result, we determine that deep learning models can be more accurate than standard DD noise-spectroscopy techniques, by requiring at the same time a much smaller number of DD sequences.

TI Teaching quantum information science to secondary school students with
   photon polarization and which-path encoding
SO EPJ QUANTUM TECHNOLOGY
AB Research and curriculum development on quantum information science is a novel but technologically and socially significant challenge for physics education. While the debate is open on the core content, the approaches, and the strategies for addressing the need of effective instruction on the subject-matter, some indications have begun to emerge. Among them, the importance of an earlier start of education and of helping students develop not only a theoretical knowledge, but also high-level experimental skills including ideal design and conduction of experiments. Such skills are challenging to attain in existing traditional programs and may be considered inaccessible at introductory level because of the difficulties connected with qubit implementations. Here we present the design process, the structure, and a preliminary evaluation of a course for secondary school that is aimed to promote the building of a basic but integrated understanding of quantum information science, including experimental design and lab activities. The course was developed within the model of educational reconstruction, and embedded into a conceptual change framework in physics and computation. The encoding of polarization and which-path information of a photon is used to engage students in the development of a global model of logical encoding and processing, in ideal experimental design of gates and circuits, and in their implementation on the optical bench. Data show the effectiveness of the course in promoting student engagement in the modelling of gates in different encodings, in fostering an understanding of the computational role of physical setups, and a positive attitude and interest towards quantum computation and innovative teaching methods.

TI Brick wall quantum circuits with global fermionic symmetry
SO SCIPOST PHYSICS
AB We study brick wall quantum circuits enjoying a global fermionic symmetry. The constituent 2-qubit gate, and its fermionic symmetry, derive from a 2-particle scattering matrix in integrable, supersymmetric quantum field theory in 1+1 dimensions. Our 2-qubit gate, as a function of three free parameters, is of so-called free fermionic or matchgate form, allowing us to derive the spectral structure of both the brick wall unitary U(F )and its, non-trivial, Hamiltonian limit H-gamma in closed form. We find that the fermionic symmetry pins H-gamma to a surface of critical points, whereas breaking that symmetry leads to non-trivial topological phases. We briefly explore quench dynamics for this class of circuits.

TI Large-alphabet time-bin quantum key distribution and
   Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen steering via dispersive optics
SO QUANTUM SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB Quantum key distribution (QKD) has established itself as a groundbreaking technology, showcasing inherent security features that are fundamentally proven. Qubit-based QKD protocols that rely on binary encoding encounter an inherent constraint related to the secret key capacity. This limitation restricts the maximum secret key capacity to one bit per photon. On the other hand, qudit-based QKD protocols have their advantages in scenarios where photons are scarce and noise is present, as they enable the transmission of more than one secret bit per photon. While proof-of-principle entangled-based qudit QKD systems have been successfully demonstrated over the years, the current limitation lies in the maximum distribution distance, which remains at 20 km fiber distance. Moreover, in these entangled high-dimensional QKD systems, the witness and distribution of quantum steering have not been shown before. Here we present a high-dimensional time-bin QKD protocol based on energy-time entanglement that generates a secure finite-length key capacity of 2.39 bit/coincidences and secure cryptographic finite-length keys at 0.24 Mbits s-1 in a 50 km optical fiber link. Our system is built entirely using readily available commercial off-the-shelf components, and secured by nonlocal dispersion cancellation technique against collective Gaussian attacks. Furthermore, we set new records for witnessing both energy-time entanglement and quantum steering over different fiber distances. When operating with a quantum channel loss of 39 dB, our system retains its inherent characteristic of utilizing large-alphabet. This enables us to achieve a secure key rate of 0.30 kbits s-1 and a secure key capacity of 1.10 bit/coincidences, considering finite-key effects. Our experimental results closely match the theoretical upper bound limit of secure cryptographic keys in high-dimensional time-bin QKD protocols (Mower et al 2013 Phys. Rev. A 87 062322; Zhang et al 2014 Phys. Rev. Lett. 112 120506), and outperform recent state-of-the-art qubit-based QKD protocols in terms of secure key throughput using commercial single-photon detectors (Wengerowsky et al 2019 Proc. Natl Acad. Sci. 116 6684; Wengerowsky et al 2020 npj Quantum Inf. 6 5; Zhang et al 2014 Phys. Rev. Lett. 112 120506; Zhang et al 2019 Nat. Photon. 13 839; Liu et al 2019 Phys. Rev. Lett. 122 160501; Zhang et al 2020 Phys. Rev. Lett. 125 010502; Wei et al 2020 Phys. Rev. X 10 031030). The simple and robust entanglement-based high-dimensional time-bin protocol presented here provides potential for practical long-distance quantum steering and QKD with multiple secure bits-per-coincidence, and higher secure cryptographic keys compared to mature qubit-based QKD protocols.

TI Quantum control of an oscillator with a Kerr-cat qubit
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Bosonic codes offer a hardware-efficient strategy for quantum error correction by redundantly encoding quantum information in the large Hilbert space of a harmonic oscillator. However, experimental realizations of these codes are often limited by ancilla errors propagating to the encoded logical qubit during syndrome measurements. The Kerr-cat qubit has been proposed as an ancilla for these codes due to its theoretically-exponential noise bias, which would enable fault-tolerant error syndrome measurements, but the coupling required to perform these syndrome measurements has not yet been demonstrated. In this work, we experimentally realize driven parametric coupling of a Kerr-cat qubit to a high-quality-factor microwave cavity and demonstrate a gate set that would enable universal quantum control of the cavity. We measure the decoherence of the cavity in the presence of the Kerr-cat and discover excess dephasing due to heating of the Kerr-cat to excited states. By engineering frequency-selective dissipation to counteract this heating, we are able to eliminate this dephasing, thereby demonstrating a high on-off ratio of control. Our results pave the way toward using the Kerr-cat to fault-tolerantly measure error syndromes of bosonic codes.

TI Stable and efficient seismic impedance inversion using quantum annealing
   with L1 norm regularization
SO JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICS AND ENGINEERING
AB Seismic impedance inversion makes a significant contribution to locating hydrocarbons and interpreting seismic data. However, it suffers from non-unique solutions, and a direct linear inversion produces large errors. Global optimization methods, such as simulated annealing, have been applied in seismic impedance inversion and achieved promising inversion results. Over the last decades, there has been an increasing interest in quantum computing. Owing to its natural parallelism, quantum computing has a powerful computational capability and certain advantages in solving complex inverse problems. In this article, we present a stable and efficient impedance inversion using quantum annealing with L1 norm regularization, which significantly improves the inversion accuracy compared to the traditional simulated annealing method. Tests on a one-dimensional 10-layer model with noisy data demonstrate that the new method exhibits significantly improved accuracy and stability. Additionally, we perform seismic impedance inversion for synthetic data from the overthrust model and field data using two methods. These results demonstrate that the quantum annealing impedance inversion with L1 norm regularization dramatically enhances the accuracy and anti-noise ability.

AB The field of Quantum Computing (QC) has gained significant popularity in recent years, due to its potential to provide benefits in terms of efficiency and effectiveness when employed to solve certain computationally intensive tasks. In both Information Retrieval (IR) and Recommender Systems (RS) we are required to build methods that apply complex processing on large and heterogeneous datasets, it is natural therefore to wonder whether QC could also be applied to boost their performance. The tutorial aims to provide first an introduction to QC for an audience that is not familiar with the technology, then to show how to apply the QC paradigm of Quantum Annealing (QA) to solve practical problems that are currently faced by IR and RS systems. During the tutorial, participants will be provided with the fundamentals required to understand QC and to apply it in practice by using a real D-Wave quantum annealer through APIs.

TI Quantum state transfer in interacting multiple-excitation systems
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
AB Quantum state transfer (QST) describes the coherent passage of quantum information from one node in a network to another. Experiments on QST span a diverse set of platforms and currently report transport across up to tens of nodes in times of several hundred nanoseconds with fidelities that can approach 90% or more. Theoretical studies examine both the lossless time evolution associated with a given (Hermitian) lattice Hamiltonian and methods based on the master equation that allows for losses. In this paper, we describe Monte Carlo techniques which enable the discovery of a Hamiltonian that gives high-fidelity QST. We benchmark our approach in geometries appropriate to coupled optical cavity-emitter arrays and discuss connections to condensed matter Hamiltonians of localized orbitals coupled to conduction bands. The resulting Jaynes-Cummings-Hubbard and periodic Anderson models can, in principle, be engineered in appropriate hardware to give efficient QST.

TI Finite-Time Teleportation Phase Transition in Random Quantum Circuits
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB How long does it take to entangle two distant qubits in a quantum circuit evolved by generic unitary dynamics? We show that if the time evolution is followed by measurements of all but two infinitely separated test qubits, then the entanglement between them can undergo a phase transition and become nonzero at a finite critical time tc. The fidelity of teleporting a quantum state from an input qubit to an infinitely distant output qubit shows the same critical onset. Specifically, these finite-time transitions occur in short-range interacting two-dimensional random unitary circuits and in sufficiently long-range interacting one-dimensional circuits. The phase transition is understood by mapping the random continuous-time evolution to a finite-temperature thermal state of an effective spin Hamiltonian, where the inverse temperature equals the evolution time in the circuit. In this framework, the entanglement between two distant qubits at times t > tc corresponds to the emergence of long-range ferromagnetic spin correlations below the critical temperature. We verify these predictions using numerical simulation of Clifford circuits and propose potential realizations in existing platforms for quantum simulation.

TI Discrimination of bosonic dephasing quantum channels
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICS A-MATHEMATICAL AND THEORETICAL
AB We study the possibility of discriminating between two bosonic dephasing quantum channels. We show that unambiguous discrimination is not realizable. We then consider discrimination with nonzero error probability and minimize this latter in the absence of input constraints. In the presence of an input energy constraint, we derive an upper bound on the error probability. Finally, we extend these results from single-shot to multi-shot discrimination, envisaging the asymptotic behavior.

TI Real-time observation of picosecond-timescale optical quantum
   entanglement towards ultrafast quantum information processing
SO NATURE PHOTONICS
AB Entanglement is a fundamental resource for various optical quantum information processing (QIP) applications. To achieve high-speed QIP systems, entanglement should be encoded in short wavepackets. Here we report the real-time observation of ultrafast optical Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen correlation at a picosecond timescale in a continuous-wave system. Optical phase-sensitive amplification using a 6-THz-bandwidth waveguide-based optical parametric amplifier enhances the effective efficiency of 70-GHz-bandwidth homodyne detectors, mainly used in 5G telecommunication, enabling its use in real-time quantum state measurement. Although power measurement using frequency scanning, such as an optical spectrum analyser, is not performed in real time, our observation is demonstrated through the real-time amplitude measurement and can be directly used in QIP applications. The observed Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen states show quantum correlation of 4.5 dB below the shot-noise level encoded in wavepackets with 40 ps period, equivalent to 25 GHz repetition-103 times faster than previous entanglement observation in continuous-wave systems. The quantum correlation of 4.5 dB is already sufficient for several QIP applications, and our system can be readily extended to large-scale entanglement. Moreover, our scheme has high compatibility with optical communication technology such as wavelength-division multiplexing, and femtosecond-timescale observation is also feasible. Our demonstration is a paradigm shift in accelerating accessible quantum correlation-the foundational resource of all quantum applications-from the nanosecond to picosecond timescales, enabling ultrafast optical QIP.

TI A Review on the Advances, Applications, and Future Prospects of
   Post-Quantum Cryptography in Blockchain and IoT
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB With the advancement of quantum computing, classical public-key cryptosystems are increasingly vulnerable, prompting global standardization efforts by organizations such as NIST, ETSI, and ISO. This paper presents a comprehensive review of recent advancements in post-quantum cryptography (PQC), with a particular focus on lattice-based, hash-based, and multivariate approaches. The study examines the security foundations, implementation challenges, and the applicability of these approaches across various domains, including finance, blockchain, and the Internet of Things (IoT). A key contribution of this work is the proposed Hybrid Cryptographic Framework (HCF), which integrates classical and quantum-resistant primitives, facilitating a secure and interoperable transition. This framework combines hybrid key exchange mechanisms, dual-signature schemes, and PQC-compatible Merkle trees, supported by a discrete multi-objective optimization model to select algorithms that meet real-world constraints. The paper also addresses deployment challenges, such as hardware acceleration, side-channel resistance, and legacy system compatibility. Real-world case studies demonstrate how leading institutions are actively piloting PQC integration. Finally, we present a strategic roadmap for the adoption of PQC, incorporating adaptive triggers based on quantum capabilities and evolving threat models. By aligning cryptographic design with international standards and practical system requirements, this paper provides valuable guidance for constructing resilient, quantum-safe infrastructures.

TI A Low-Complexity Quantum Simulation Framework for Toeplitz-Structured
   Matrix and Its Application in Signal Processing
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON QUANTUM ENGINEERING
AB Toeplitz matrix reconstruction algorithms (TMRAs) are one of the central subroutines in array processing for wireless communication applications. The classical TMRAs have shown excellent accuracy in the spectral estimation for both uncorrelated and coherence sources in the recent era. However, TMRAs incorporate the classical eigenvalue decomposition technique for estimating the eigenvalues of the Toeplitz-structured covariance matrices that demand very high computational complexity for large arrays. We demonstrate a low-complexity quantum simulation framework exploiting the structured Hamiltonian of Toeplitz and circulant variants. In this framework, we consider two approaches for the estimation of the eigenvalue spectrum of a given Toeplitz-structured matrix: first, an analytical framework with Jordan form-based sparse-decomposition of a dense-Toeplitz matrix, and second, an approximation method for the conversion of a Toeplitz matrix into a circulant matrix embedding quantum subroutines. We have also compared the efficacy of the proposed algorithms with standard Hamiltonian simulation and quantum phase estimation techniques for different quantum time resolutions and gate complexities. We show quantum gate-complexity analysis for our proposed algorithms. Considering the large dimensions of the Toeplitz matrix, we have employed random matrix theory in deriving the error bounds for the estimated eigenvalues. The numerical results are obtained partly in a classical computer and in an IBM quantum simulator.

TI Self-aligned gates for scalable silicon quantum computing
SO APPLIED PHYSICS LETTERS
AB Silicon quantum dot spin qubits have great potential for application in large-scale quantum circuits as they share many similarities with conventional transistors that represent the prototypical example for scalable electronic platforms. However, for quantum dot formation and control, additional gates are required, which add to device complexity and, thus, hinder upscaling. Here, we meet this challenge by demonstrating the scalable integration of a multilayer gate stack in silicon quantum dot devices using self-alignment, which allows for ultrasmall gate lengths and intrinsically perfect layer-to-layer alignment. We explore the prospects of these devices as hosts for hole spin qubits that benefit from electrically driven spin control via spin-orbit interaction. Therefore, we study hole transport through a double quantum dot and observe current rectification due to the Pauli spin blockade. The application of a small magnetic field leads to lifting of the spin blockade and reveals the presence of spin-orbit interaction. From the magnitude of a singlet-triplet anticrossing at a high magnetic field, we estimate a spin orbit energy of similar to 37 mu eV, which corresponds to a spin orbit length of similar to 48nm. This work paves the way for scalable spin- based quantum circuits with fast, all-electrical qubit control. Published under license by AIP Publishing.

TI Faster variational quantum algorithms with quantum kernel-based
   surrogate models
SO QUANTUM SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB We present a new optimization strategy for small-to-intermediate scale variational quantum algorithms (VQAs) on noisy near-term quantum processors which uses a Gaussian process surrogate model equipped with a classically-evaluated quantum kernel. VQAs are typically optimized using gradient-based approaches however these are difficult to implement on current noisy devices, requiring large numbers of objective function evaluations. Our approach shifts this computational burden onto the classical optimizer component of these hybrid algorithms, greatly reducing the number of quantum circuit evaluations required from the quantum processor. We focus on the variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) algorithm and demonstrate numerically that these surrogate models are particularly well suited to the algorithm's objective function. Next, we apply these models to both noiseless and noisy VQE simulations and show that they exhibit better performance than widely-used classical kernels in terms of final accuracy and convergence speed. Compared to the typically-used stochastic gradient-descent approach to VQAs, our quantum kernel-based approach is found to consistently achieve significantly higher accuracy while requiring less than an order of magnitude fewer quantum circuit executions. We analyze the performance of the quantum kernel-based models in terms of the kernels' induced feature spaces and explicitly construct their feature maps. Finally, we describe a scheme for approximating the best-performing quantum kernel using a classically-efficient tensor network representation of its input state and so provide a pathway for scaling this strategy to larger systems.

SO IEEE OPEN JOURNAL OF THE COMPUTER SOCIETY
AB Quantum cryptography has the potential to secure the infrastructures that are vulnerable to various attacks, like classical attacks, including quantum-related attacks. Therefore, quantum cryptography seems to be a promising technology for the future secure online infrastructures and applications, like blockchain-based frameworks. In this article, we propose a generic quantum blockchain-envisioned security framework for an Internet of Things (IoT) environment. We then discuss some potential applications of the proposed framework. We also highlight the security advantages of quantum cryptography-based systems. We explain the working of blockchain, applications of blockchain, types of blockchain, the structure of blockchain, the structure of blockchain in a classical blockchain, and the structure of a block in a quantum blockchain context. Next, the adverse effects of quantum computing on the security of blockchain-based frameworks are highlighted. Furthermore, the comparisons of quantum cryptography-based security schemes, like quantum key distribution, quantum digital signature, and quantum hashing schemes, are provided. Finally, some future research directions related to the designed generic quantum blockchain-envisioned security framework for IoT are provided.

TI Constant-depth fan-out with real-time feedforward on a superconducting
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW APPLIED
AB When using unitary gate sequences, the growth in depth of many quantum circuits with output size poses significant obstacles to practical quantum computation. The quantum fan-out operation, which reduces the circuit depth of quantum algorithms such as the quantum Fourier transform and Shor's algorithm, is an example that can be realized in constant depth independent of the output size. Here, we demonstrate a quantum fan-out gate with real-time feedforward on up to four output qubits using a superconducting quantum processor. By performing quantum state tomography on the output states, we benchmark our gate with input states spanning the entire Bloch sphere. We decompose the output-state error into a set of independently characterized error contributions. We extrapolate our constant-depth circuit to offer a scaling advantage compared to the unitary fan-out sequence beyond 25 output qubits with feedforward control, or beyond 17 output qubits if the classical feedforward latency is negligible. Our work highlights the potential of midcircuit measurements combined with real-time conditional operations to improve the efficiency of complex quantum algorithms.

TI Hybrid Exchange-Measurement-Based Qubit Operations in Semiconductor
   Double-Quantum-Dot Qubits
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW APPLIED
AB Measurement-based quantum computing (MBQC) promises an alternative approach to quantum computation that has natural compatibility with error-correction codes at the cost of a polynomial increase in physical qubits. MBQC implementations have previously focused on photonic systems where twoqubit gates are difficult. On the other hand, semiconductor spin qubit systems offer fast two-qubit gates via the exchange interaction. To explore the benefits of MBQC on spin systems, two hybrid measurement-exchange schemes for full qubit control with semiconductor double-quantum-dot spin qubits are considered. Protocol 1 fully realizes the cluster-state approach to MBQC but requires singlet-triplet qubits in a magnetic field gradient. Protocol 2 implements a direct measurement-based replacement for more traditional gate-based encoded operations, without need for magnetic field gradients. Both protocols demonstrate full single-and two-qubit control through a combination of interqubit and intraqubit exchange and measurement onto the singlet-triplet basis. We show that both schemes suppress individual qubit spin-state leakage errors and offer fast gate times, up to known phase and Pauli corrections.

TI Majorana subsystem qubit codes that also correct odd-weight errors
SO NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB A potential platform for topological quantum computation is the Majorana-based tetron architecture. Its building blocks are superconducting islands called tetrons, which host four Majorana zero modes. Existing error correcting codes can correct even-weight errors on tetrons. In a previous proposal by us, we had shown that incorporating tetrons in the stabilizer group allows us to correct a combination of odd-weight errors and even-weight errors on tetrons. In this work, we show that inclusion of tetrons in the gauge group lets us create subsystem codes from conventional Pauli stabilizer codes, which can correct both kinds of errors. Compared to the previous approach, the current approach lets us construct codes with fewer stabilizer generators. This leads to shorter fault-tolerant sequence length, and improves the fault-tolerant pseudothreshold by as much as 84%.

TI Generation of all-to-all connections in a two-dimensional qubit array
   with two-body interactions
SO JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYSICS
AB All-to-all connections are required in general quantum annealing machines to solve various combinatorial optimization problems. The Lechner, Hauke, and Zoller method, which is used to realize the all-to-all connections, requires many-body interactions in locally connected qubits. Because most of the qubit interactions are two-body interactions, Lechner also proposed the construction of each four-body interaction by six controlled-NOT (CNOT) gates between two qubits. However, it is difficult to construct many CNOT gates. Herein, we show more concrete sequences to produce four-body and three-body interactions based on a two-dimensional solid-state qubit system. We show that the number of operations needed to construct the many-body interactions can be reduced using appropriate pulse sequences. These findings will help reduce quantum computation costs for solving combinatorial problems.

AB We present Benchpress, a benchmarking suite for evaluating the performance and range of functionality of multiple quantum computing software development kits.

Here we give a detailed overview of the benchmark suite and its methodology and generate representative results over seven different quantum software packages. The flexibility of the Benchpress framework enables benchmarking that not only keeps pace with quantum hardware improvements but also can preemptively gauge the quantum circuit processing costs of future device architectures.

TI Trusted execution environments for quantum computers
SO FRONTIERS IN COMPUTER SCIENCE
AB The cloud-based environments in which today's and future quantum computers will operate raise concerns about the security and privacy of user's intellectual property, whether code, or data, or both. Without dedicated security protections, quantum circuits submitted to cloud-based quantum computer providers could be accessed by the cloud provider, or malicious insiders working in the cloud provider's data centers. Furthermore, data embedded in these circuits can similarly be accessed as it is encoded using quantum gates inside the circuit. This study presents various hardware and architecture modifications that could be deployed in today's quantum computers, based on superconducting qubits, to protect both the code and data from potentially untrusted quantum computer providers or malicious insiders. Motivated by existing Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs) in classical computers, this study introduces the notion of Quantum Trusted Execution Environments (QTEEs) which leverage trusted hardware to hide or obfuscate quantum circuits executing on a remote, cloud-based quantum computer. This study presents multiple, different approaches to design of QTEEs and considers both hardware and architecture, as well as system software and operating system support necessary for realization of QTEEs. Overall, this study presents three hardware architectures, namely, QC-TEE, SoteriaQ, and CASQUE, that have been designed to protect users' circuits and data from potential threats originating from both malicious quantum computer cloud providers or insider attackers. This study further outlines a roadmap for other possible QTEEs that can be developed in the future, to account for different threat models or to support different types of quantum computer architectures.

TI A High-Dimensional Spin-Qudit Candidate of Gd(III) Center Complex with

SO CCS CHEMISTRY
AB Quantum information processing depends on the construction of a quantum bit (qubit). In particular, the intrinsic multilevel structures of 4f rare-earth complexes with high spin are suitable carriers for realizing high scalability in the molecule-based highdimensional spin qubit. A single crystal of Gd (III) complex [Gd 0.02 Y 1.98 (pydc) 6 (H 2 pip) 3 ] <middle dot> 20 H 2 O ( S = 7/2) with 3-fold axial symmetry ( C 3 ) was characterized by the X-band electron paramagnetic resonance in different orientations to resolve the energy-level structures, research the spin dynamic properties, and verify the ability to realize arbitrary quantum manipulation. The Rabi frequencies in two specific orientations, ( C 3 parallel to B 0 and C 3 perpendicular to B 0 ), were well matched with the diverse Rabi cycle model, indicating that the selective transitions in the single crystal samples could be accurately predicted in any direction along the static magnetic field B 0 .

TI Numerical Investigation of a Coupled Micropillar - Waveguide System for
   Integrated Quantum Photonic Circuits
SO ADVANCED QUANTUM TECHNOLOGIES
AB The on-chip resonant excitation of single quantum dots (QDs) via integrated microlasers represents an effective and scalable method for integrated quantum photonics applications based on on-demand single-photon emitters. In this study, the design and numerical optimization of the evanescent coupling between whispering gallery modes (WGMs) of a micropillar resonator and a nearby single-mode ridge waveguide in the Al(Ga)As/GaAs material system are presented. In this study, such systems are examined within a wavelength range of 930 nm, which is suitable for resonant excitation of typical self-assembled InGaAs quantum dots. In particular, the coupling and the transmitted optical power of a WGM resonator to a ridge waveguide are examined for a range of gap spacings, with the objective of optimizing the photon coupling efficiency and Q-factor of the monolithically integrated nanophotonic system. The findings of this study enable to identify the best device parameters for subsequent device fabrication. The findings establish a foundation for the production of highly effective photonic quantum circuits through the use of WGM microlasers integrated into evanescently coupled waveguide systems, including resonantly excited single quantum dots.
   In this work, the conceptual device of a whispering gallery mode micropillar coupled to a ridge waveguide is presented for the subsequent realization of the on-demand and on-chip resonant excitation of waveguide integrated quantum dots. The finite element method is then used to precisely characterize the quality factor and the coupling efficiency of such a device for different geometry parameters. image

TI A Two-Tier Authentication Framework Integrating Post-Quantum
   Cryptography with AI-Based Emotion Recognition
SO CONTEMPORARY MATHEMATICS
AB Quantum computing threatens mainstream cryptosystems that rely on integer factorization and discretelogarithm hardness assumptions. Although Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC) and biometric authentication have each progressed rapidly, few solutions fuse their respective advantages. We present an AI-enhanced post-quantum two-tier authentication framework that unifies cryptographic robustness with adaptive, behaviour-based biometrics. Tier 1 uses conventional factors-passwords and static biometrics-to establish a baseline identity. Tier 2 then acquires dynamic emotional cues from facial expressions, speech prosody and physiological signals, which are continuously analysed by deep-learning models. The resulting emotion signatures are bound to the credential stream via a lattice-based chameleon hash and signed with the CRYSTALS-Dilithium scheme, yielding strong resistance to spoofing, coercion and quantum adversaries. Simulation results show a True Acceptance Rate of 95.7% and a False Acceptance Rate of 2.1% under targeted adversarial attacks. These findings demonstrate that coupling emotion-aware AI biometrics with PQC primitives can deliver adaptive, quantum-resilient authentication for next-generation digital infrastructure.

By leveraging the inherent strengths of Ethernet, such as addressing, MAC layer functionality, and scalability; we propose a practical framework to support the rigorous requirements of quantum communication. Some novel protocols given in this study enable reliable end-to-end quantum entanglement over Ethernet, ensuring the adaptability needed for implementing a stable quantum internet. Detailed time-delay analyses confirm that our protocols offer superior performance compared to existing methods, with total time delay kept within the decoherence threshold of qubits. These results suggest that our approach is well-suited for deployment in realistic environments, meeting both the immediate needs of quantum networking and laying the groundwork for future advances in data exchange and quantum computational capabilities.

TI Exploring the boundary of quantum network states from inside out
SO COMMUNICATIONS PHYSICS
AB Quantum networks with bipartite resources and shared randomness present the simplest infrastructure for implementing a future quantum internet. Here, we shall investigate which kinds of entanglement can or cannot be generated from this kind of quantum network by examining their fidelity with different graph states. On the one hand, based on a standard form of graph states under local complementation and a fine-grained uncertainty relation between two projections, we establish upper bounds of fidelity that improve upon previous results by at least 25% as the dimension of local systems tends to infinity. On the other hand, in the triangle network, we propose efficient protocols to generate genuine multipartite entangled states from the network, providing significant nontrivial lower bounds of fidelity with high-dimensional GHZ states.

AB Integrating Quantum Key Distribution service with classical high-speed optical data transmission using a dense wavelength division multiplexing technique in a fiber is a cost-effective solution to improve the network's security. In this multichannel system, several noise sources degrade the quality of the quantum channel. The dominant degradation effect is determined by modeling in different cases. Optical filtering cannot decrease spontaneous Raman Scattering caused by the classical optical channels. So this nonlinear optical effect is investigated in detail with different system parameter setups. The optimal channel allocation and the required bandgap between the classical and quantum channels are determined.

TI Spin-wave quantum computing with atoms in a single-mode cavity
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB We present a method for network-capable quantum computing that relies on holographic spin-wave excitations stored collectively in ensembles of qubits. We construct an orthogonal basis of spin waves in a one-dimensional array and show that high-fidelity universal linear controllability can be achieved using only phase shifts, applied in both momentum and position space. Neither single-site addressability nor high single-qubit cooperativity is required, and the spin waves can be read out with high efficiency into a single cavity mode for quantum computing and networking applications. We describe how to establish linear quantum processing using a lambda scheme in a rubidium-atom system and calculate the expected experimental operational fidelities due to fundamental and technical errors. We derive efficient methods to achieve linear controllability in both a single-ensemble and dual-ensemble configuration. Finally, we propose to use the spin-wave processor for continuous-variable quantum information processing and present a scheme to generate large dual-rail cluster states useful for deterministic computing.

TI Robustness of quantum chaos and anomalous relaxation in open quantum
   circuits
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Dissipation is a ubiquitous phenomenon that affects the fate of chaotic quantum many-body dynamics. Here, we show that chaos can be robust against dissipation but can also assist and anomalously enhance relaxation. We compute exactly the dissipative form factor of a generic Floquet quantum circuit with arbitrary on-site dissipation modeled by quantum channels and find that, for long enough times, the system always relaxes with two distinctive regimes characterized by the presence or absence of gap-closing. While the system can sustain a robust ramp for a long (but finite) time interval in the gap-closing regime, relaxation is "assisted" by quantum chaos in the regime where the gap remains nonzero. In the latter regime, we prove that, if the thermodynamic limit is taken first, the gap does not close even in the dissipationless limit. We complement our analytical findings with numerical results for quantum qubit circuits.
   Quantum chaos is a useful framework for quantum many-body systems, but it has been mostly applied to isolated systems. Here the authors study the interplay of chaos and dissipation in open quantum circuits, showing that chaos is robust against weak dissipation but can also assist and anomalously enhance relaxation.

We contrast two-qubit and two-qudit systems by pointing out how some of the properties of two-qubit systems generalize to higher dimensions and explore emerging new properties for dimensions three or higher. One example is provided by the Werner states: when the density operator is written in the fundamental representation, we show that only two-qubit Werner states can be pure states, but not two-qudit Werner states when the qudit dimension is larger than two.

AB Post-quantum cryptography (PQC) aims to develop quantum-safe algorithms against attacks by a quantum computer. As quantum-safe algorithms require much larger keys in their operation compared to the current RSA/ECC practice, the networking latency significantly increases when executing the protocols with sending such large keys. This problem gets more challenging in the era of Web-of-Things (WoT) with low-memory devices. To tackle the problem, we propose EXPRESSPQDELIVERY, which is, to the best of our knowledge, the first immediately deployable protocol to efficiently transport large keys. It leverages the DNS infrastructure, as DNS is close to clients, guaranteeing express key delivery with a short round-trip time (RTT). We split a large PQ key along with a server's signature and feed them into several DNS records. To show the feasibility of EXPRESSPQDELIVERY, we instantiate it with TLS 1.3 [36] and demonstrate that it reduces 27% of network latency between a server and a client on average compared to the standard TLS 1.3. We deploy EXPRESSPQDELIVERY on a low-capability board with 256 KB RAM, showing a significant high gain (34%).

TI The Effect of Trap Design on the Scalability of Trapped-Ion Quantum
   Technologies
SO ENTROPY
AB To increase the power of a trapped-ion quantum information processor, the qubit number, gate speed, and gate fidelity must all increase. All three of these parameters are influenced by the trapping field, which, in turn, depends on the electrode geometry. Here, we consider how the electrode geometry affects the following radial trapping parameters: trap height, harmonicity, depth, and trap frequency. We introduce a simple multi-wafer geometry comprising a ground plane above a surface trap and compare the performance of this trap to a surface trap and a multi-wafer trap that is a miniaturized version of a linear Paul trap. We compare the voltage and frequency requirements needed to reach a desired radial trap frequency and find that the two multi-wafer trap designs provide significant improvements in expected power dissipation over the surface trap design in large part due to increased harmonicity. Finally, we consider the fabrication requirements and the path towards the integration of the necessary optical control. This work provides a basis to optimize future trap designs with scalability in mind.

TI Quantum Cardiovascular Medicine: From Hype to Hope-A Critical Review of
   Real-World Applications
SO JOURNAL OF CLINICAL MEDICINE
AB Context: As quantum technologies advance with innovations in cardiovascular medicine, it can be challenging to distinguish genuine clinical progress from mere ideas. There will also be difficult transitions involved in moving technology from proof of concept demonstrated in the lab. This transition is complicated by the excitement and hype that comes with any new technology. Aim: This work aims to assess what quantum technologies are available in cardiovascular medicine for real-world use, to identify which applications are closer to clinically relevant translation, and to differentiate realistic advances from advanced-not-yet realities. Methods: A narrative review was conducted using PubMed, EMBASE, Scopus, Web of Science, IEEE Xplore, and arXiv. While real-world use of technologies was prioritized, we included all theoretical literature, regardless of date of publication. Search terms were a combination of the vocabulary of quantum technologies and the vocabulary of cardiovascular medicine. Peer-reviewed publications included primary research, reviews, theoretical works, and conference proceedings. Two reviewers independently screened all citations, and any disagreements were resolved through consensus discussion. Results: We identified three core application areas: (1) quantum sensing, such as cardiac magnetometry, where there is potential for SQUID magnetocardiography to be used for detecting cardiomyopathy; (2) quantum computing for cardiovascular risk prediction, and (3) next-generation quantum sensors for mobile cardiac imaging. Conclusions: Quantum technology in cardiovascular medicine represents modest promise in select applications, most notably, magnetocardiography. To go from "hype to hope", clinical trials will be required to identify application domains where quantum technologies outweigh the challenges of implementation in clinical practice.

TI Formulation and evaluation of ocean dynamics problems as optimization
   problems for quantum annealing machines
SO PLOS ONE
AB Recent advancements in quantum computing suggest the potential to revolutionize computational algorithms across various scientific domains including oceanography and atmospheric science. The field is still relatively young and quantum computation is so different from classical computation that suitable frameworks to represent oceanic and atmospheric dynamics are yet to be explored. Quantum annealing (QA), one of the major paradigms, focuses on combinatorial optimization tasks. Given its potential to excel in NP-hard problems, QA may significantly accelerate the calculation of ocean and atmospheric systems described by the Navier-Stokes equations in the future. In this paper, we apply both QA and simulated annealing (SA), its classical counterpart, to a simplified ocean model known as the Stommel problem. We use the Stommel problem, which is not an NP problem and therefore does not benefit from QA today, just as an example, a first step in exploring QA for more intricate problems governed by the Navier-Stokes equations. We cast the linear partial differential equation governing the Stommel model into an optimization problem by the least-squares method and discretize the cost function in two ways: finite difference and truncated basis expansion. In either case, SA successfully reproduces the expected solution when appropriate parameters are chosen. In contrast, QA using the D-Wave quantum annealing machine fails to obtain good solutions for some cases owing to hardware limitations; in particular, the highly limited connectivity graph of the machine limits the size of the solvable problems, at least under currently available algorithms. Either expanding the machine's connectivity graph or improving the graph-embedding algorithms would probably be necessary for quantum annealing machines to be usable for oceanic and atmospheric dynamics problems.

This procedure is based on the standard randomized benchmarking protocol and provides an estimate for the fidelity of a quantum network link. We provide statistical analysis of the protocol as well as a simulated implementation inspired by nitrogen-vacancy center systems using Netsquid, a special purpose simulator for noisy quantum networks.

TI Optical charge injection and coherent control of a quantum-dot
   spin-qubit emitting at telecom wavelengths
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Long-distance quantum communication relies on interfacing qubits with telecom-band photons. Here the authors implement a solid-state spin-qubit based on a hole confined in a semiconductor quantum dot emitting photons in the telecom C-band.
   Solid-state quantum emitters with manipulable spin-qubits are promising platforms for quantum communication applications. Although such light-matter interfaces could be realized in many systems only a few allow for light emission in the telecom bands necessary for long-distance quantum networks. Here, we propose and implement an optically active solid-state spin-qubit based on a hole confined in a single InAs/GaAs quantum dot grown on an InGaAs metamorphic buffer layer emitting photons in the C-band. We lift the hole spin-degeneracy using an external magnetic field and demonstrate hole injection, initialization, read-out and complete coherent control using picosecond optical pulses. These results showcase a solid-state spin-qubit platform compatible with preexisting optical fiber networks.

TI Warm and Cold Start Quantum Annealing for Metaverse Resource
   Optimization
SO IEEE OPEN JOURNAL OF THE COMMUNICATIONS SOCIETY
AB Metaverse refers to the intersection of parallel virtual worlds with their physical counterparts by allowing users to interact with virtual people, objects, and environments. Resource allocation in various aspects of Metaverse domains, called as MetaSlices hereinafter, is a crucial optimization research problem. To serve this purpose, we consider a MetaSlice framework with the notion of sharing resources among common functions and enable placing time-sensitive services at the edge of multi-tier architecture in proximity to users. Unfortunately, the classical Integer Linear Programming is inappropriate for such heavily constrained optimization problem due to the extensive running time and memory. Hence, we model a novel Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) formulation to simultaneously optimize resources and secure Quality of Service for MetaSlices as a paradigm shift towards quantum computing. Furthermore, we propose to employ two hybrid classical-quantum strategies, Warm Start and Cold Start Quantum Annealing to optimize resource under bandwidth uncertainty, offer ultra-low running time, and increase service acceptance rate/scalability in a resource-hungry and dynamic Metaverse system.

TI Triunitary quantum circuits
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB We introduce a class of quantum circuits that are unitary along three distinct "arrows of time." These dynamics share some of the analytical tractability of "dual-unitary" circuits, while exhibiting distinctive and richer phenomenology. We find that two-point correlations in these dynamics are strictly confined to three directions in (1 + 1)-dimensional spacetime-the two light cone edges, delta x = +/-nu delta t, and the static worldline delta x = 0. Along these directions, correlation functions are obtained exactly in terms of quantum channels built from the individual gates that make up the circuit. We prove that, for a class of initial states, entanglement grows at the maximum allowed speed up to an entropy density of at least one half of the thermal value, at which point it becomes model-dependent. Finally, we extend our circuit construction to 2 + 1 dimensions, where two-point correlation functions are confined to the one-dimensional edges of a tetrahedral light cone-a subdimensional propagation of information reminiscent of "fractonic" physics.

AB Quantum circuit compilation comprises many computationally hard reasoning tasks that lie inside #P and its decision counterpart in PP. The classical simulation of universal quantum circuits is a core example. We show for the first time that a strong simulation of universal quantum circuits can be efficiently tackled through weighted model counting by providing a linear-length encoding of Clifford+T circuits. To achieve this, we exploit the stabilizer formalism by Knill, Gottesmann, and Aaronson by reinterpreting quantum states as a linear combination of stabilizer states. With an open-source simulator implementation, we demonstrate empirically that model counting often outperforms state-of-the-art simulation techniques based on the ZX calculus and decision diagrams. Our work paves the way to apply the existing array of powerful classical reasoning tools to realize efficient quantum circuit compilation; one of the obstacles on the road towards quantum supremacy.

AB To realize the full potential of quantum computers, we must mitigate qubit errors by developing noise-aware algorithms, compilers, and architectures. Thus, simulating quantum programs on high-performance computing (HPC) systems with different noise models is a de facto tool researchers use. Unfortunately, noisy simulators iteratively execute a similar circuit for thousands of trials, thereby incurring significant performance overheads.
   To address this, we propose a noisy simulation technique called Tree-Based Quantum Circuit Simulation (TQSim) 1. TQSim exploits the reusability of intermediate results during the noisy simulation, reducing computation. TQSim dynamically partitions a circuit into several subcircuits. It then reuses the intermediate results from these subcircuits during computation. Compared to a noisy Qulacs-based baseline simulator, TQSim achieves a speedup of up to 3.89x for noisy simulations. TQSim is designed to be efficient with multi-node setups while also maintaining tight fidelity bounds.

TI A new non-entangled quantum secret sharing protocol among different
   nodes in further quantum networks
SO FRONTIERS IN PHYSICS
AB As an important branch of quantum secure multi-party computation, quantum secret sharing (QSS) can distribute secret information among dishonest network nodes without revealing the secrets. In this study, a new four-party QSS protocol based on locally indistinguishable orthogonal product (LIOP) states is first proposed for quantum network communication. Then, the general multiparty QSS model based on LIOP states will be expanded. Combined with the property of LIOP states and obfuscating operation, the source node can send the secrets to different destination nodes in the quantum network. Accordingly, it is proven that the destination nodes have to work together to recover the shared secrets against some existing attacks. Furthermore, no entangled resources and complicated operations are required in the presented protocol. We hope the results could make positive effects to the development of quantum secure communication in the future.

TI Multiple beamforming of array antenna using quantum annealing
SO IEICE COMMUNICATIONS EXPRESS
AB This paper proposes a novel method for controlling the directional pattern of array antennas using a quantum computer. Phase shifters are attached to each element of the array antenna, and the problem of controlling the directional pattern is formulated as a QUBO (Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization) format. The optimal weight coefficients of the phase shifters are determined using quantum annealing. It is shown that a high-gain beam is formed in the desired direction by the proposed method. Also, a formula for forming multiple beams has been proposed. Furthermore, it is confirmed that the executing time remains stable even as the number of antenna elements is increased. Effectiveness of the proposed method for high-speed control of large-scale array antennas is demonstrated.

TI Universal Neutral-Atom Quantum Computer with Individual Optical
   Addressing and Nondestructive Readout
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB Quantum computers must achieve large-scale fault-tolerant operation to deliver on their promise of transformational processing power. This will require thousands or millions of high-fidelity quantum gates and similar numbers of qubits. Demonstrations using neutral-atom qubits trapped and manipulated by lasers have shown that this modality can provide high two-qubit gate (CZ) fidelities and scalable operation. However, the gates in these demonstrations are driven by lasers that do not resolve individual qubits, with universal computation enabled by physical midcircuit shuttling of the qubits. This relatively slow operation may greatly extend run times for useful large-scale computation. Here, we demonstrate a universal neutral-atom quantum computer with gate rates limited by optical switching times, rather than shuttling, by individually addressing tightly focused laser beams at an array of single atoms. We achieve CZ fidelity of 99.35(4)% and local single-qubit RZ gate fidelity of 99.902(8)% in both cases accounting for leakage out of the computational basis. Moreover, we demonstrate nondestructive readout of alkali-atom qubits with 0.9(3)% loss, which boosts operational speed. This technique also enables us to measure a state-of-theart CZ fidelity of 99.73(3)% when excluding atom-loss events, which may be mitigated through erasure conversion. Our results represent a critical step toward large-scale fault-tolerant neutral-atom quantum computers that can execute computations on practical timescales.

TI Representation Learning via Quantum Neural Tangent Kernels
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB Variational quantum circuits are used in quantum machine learning and variational quantum simulation tasks. Designing good variational circuits or predicting how well they perform for given learning or optimization tasks is still unclear. Here we discuss these problems, analyzing variational quantum circuits using the theory of neural tangent kernels. We define quantum neural tangent kernels, and derive dynamical equations for their associated loss function in optimization and learning tasks. We analytically solve the dynamics in the frozen limit, or lazy training regime, where variational angles change slowly and a linear perturbation is good enough. We extend the analysis to a dynamical setting, including quadratic corrections in the variational angles. We then consider a hybrid quantum classical architecture and define a large-width limit for hybrid kernels, showing that a hybrid quantum classical neural network can be approximately Gaussian. The results presented here show limits for which analytical understandings of the training dynamics for variational quantum circuits, used for quantum machine learning and optimization problems, are possible. These analytical results are supported by numerical simulations of quantum machine-learning experiments.

TI Monitoring Fast Superconducting Qubit Dynamics Using a Neural Network
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW X
AB Weak measurements of a superconducting qubit produce noisy voltage signals that are weakly correlated with the qubit state. To recover individual quantum trajectories from these noisy signals, traditional methods require slow qubit dynamics and substantial prior information in the form of calibration experiments. Monitoring rapid qubit dynamics, e.g., during quantum gates, requires more complicated methods with increased demand for prior information. Here, we experimentally demonstrate an alternative method for accurately tracking rapidly driven superconducting qubit trajectories that uses a long short-term memory (LSTM) artificial neural network with minimal prior information. Despite few training assumptions, the LSTM produces trajectories that include qubit-readout resonator correlations due to a finite detection bandwidth. In addition to revealing rotated measurement eigenstates and a reduced measurement rate in agreement with theory for a fixed drive, the trained LSTM also correctly reconstructs evolution for an unknown drive with rapid modulation. Our work enables new applications of weak measurements with faster or initially unknown qubit dynamics, such as the diagnosis of coherent errors in quantum gates.

TI Exploring the Advantages of Layout Procedure with Fully-Connected
   Quantum Computing Technologies
SO ADVANCED QUANTUM TECHNOLOGIES
AB Even though quantum algorithms are designed using an idealised high-level quantum circuit description, the execution on real devices must consider the backend physical properties. Contemporary noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) computers are characterized by limited inter-qubit connectivity and an exclusive set of native gates, whose execution is affected by non-negligible errors and non-idealities. Quantum compilation, consisting of logic and layout synthesis, aims to recast the original circuit description to the target hardware by solving the coupling-constraint and to minimize the execution time and the error rate. While a previous article addresses the first phase, the second one is the aim of this manuscript. Currently available layout tools mainly target superconducting technology. This article tries to match the unmet need for a layout synthesis library supporting a wider range of technologies. The most promising algorithms already present in the state of the art are adapted to extend the compatibility to all the supported technologies, and new approaches, which exploit the awareness of the coupling strength in fully-connected topologies, are proposed. The integrated procedures are benchmarked against IBM's Qiskit and Cambridge Quantum Computing's t|ket⟩$\textrm {t} \vert \textrm {ket} \rangle$ compilation toolchains, and even though these strategies can be further improved, the results are encouraging.
   This article presents a layout synthesis library supporting superconducting transmon qubits, quantum dots, nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), and trapped ions. It includes promising algorithms in the literature adapted to the various technologies and new algorithms for evaluating the potential benefits of a routing stage in the case of fully connected topology.image

TI LIRB-Based Quantum Circuit Fidelity Assessment and Gate Fault Diagnosis
SO CMC-COMPUTERS MATERIALS & CONTINUA
AB Quantum circuit fidelity is a crucial metric for assessing the accuracy of quantum computation results and indicating the precision of quantum algorithm execution. The primary methods for assessing quantum circuit fidelity include direct fidelity estimation and mirror circuit fidelity estimation. The former is challenging to implement in practice, while the latter requires substantial classical computational resources and numerous experimental runs. In this paper, we propose a fidelity estimation method based on Layer Interleaved Randomized Benchmarking, which decomposes a complex quantum circuit into multiple sublayers. By independently evaluating the fidelity of each layer, one can comprehensively assess the performance of the entire quantum circuit. This layered evaluation strategy not only enhances accuracy but also effectively identifies and analyzes errors in specific quantum gates or qubits through independent layer evaluation. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method improves circuit fidelity by an average of 6.8% and 4.1% compared to Layer Randomized Benchmarking and Interleaved Randomized Benchmarking methods in a thermal relaxation noise environment, and by 40% compared to Layer RB in a bit-flip noise environment. Moreover, the method detects preset faulty quantum gates in circuits generated by the Munich Quantum Toolkit Benchmark, verifying the model's validity and providing a new tool for faulty gate detection in quantum circuits.

TI Tuning and amplifying the interactions in superconducting quantum
   circuits with subradiant qubits
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB We propose a tunable coupler consisting of N fixed-frequency qubits, which can tune and even amplify the effective interaction between two superconducting quantum circuits. The tuning range of the interaction is proportional to N, with a minimum value of zero and a maximum that can exceed the physical coupling rates between the coupler and the circuits. The effective coupling rate is determined by the collective magnetic quantum number of the qubit ensemble, which takes only discrete values and is free from collective decay and decoherence. Using single-photon pi-pulses, the coupling rate can be switched between arbitrary choices of the initial and final values within the dynamic range in a single step without going through intermediate values. A cascade of the couplers for amplifying small interactions or weak signals is also discussed. These results should not only stimulate interest in exploring the collective effects in quantum information processing, but also enable development of applications in tuning and amplifying the interactions in a general cavity-QED system.

TI Quantum-enhanced learning with a controllable bosonic variational sensor
   network
SO QUANTUM SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB The emergence of quantum sensor networks has presented opportunities for enhancing complex sensing tasks, while simultaneously introducing significant challenges in designing and analyzing quantum sensing protocols due to the intricate nature of entanglement and physical processes. Supervised learning assisted by an entangled sensor network (SLAEN) (Zhuang and Zhang 2019 Phys. Rev. X 9 041023) represents a promising paradigm for automating sensor-network design through variational quantum machine learning. However, the original SLAEN, constrained by the Gaussian nature of quantum circuits, is limited to learning linearly separable data. Leveraging the universal quantum control available in cavity quantum electrodynamics experiments, we propose a generalized SLAEN capable of handling nonlinear data classification tasks. We establish a theoretical framework for physical-layer data classification to underpin our approach. Through training quantum probes and measurements, we uncover a threshold phenomenon in classification error across various tasks-when the energy of probes exceeds a certain threshold, the error drastically diminishes to zero, providing a significant improvement over the Gaussian SLAEN. Despite the non-Gaussian nature of the problem, we offer analytical insights into determining the threshold and residual error in the presence of noise. Our findings carry implications for radio-frequency photonic sensors and microwave dark matter haloscopes.

AB As the prospects for scaled quantum computing steadily improve, there is an important disruption emerging in response within the world of security: post-quantum cryptography, or PQC. In the 1990s, Peter Shor showed that if scaled quantum computers were to exist, they could be used to efficiently break trap door functions underlying our widely used public key cryptography algorithms (RSA, DSA, ECDSA, ECDH). Various US government agencies have issued reports on this concern, including NIST which embarked on a standardization effort to select new algorithms with the help of the cryptography community as of 2016. But while NIST will address the problem of new algorithms, many organizations feel puzzled at the uncertain timeline for PQC and the lack of guidance on the path forward with migration. In this paper, we discuss the problem of PQC readiness from an organization's point of view, providing recommendations on how to understand the landscape and guidance on what can and should be done in a phased manner. While scaled quantum computing may seem a distant concern, we believe there are good reasons for an organization to start now in developing its understanding of the situation and creating a phased action plan toward PQC readiness.

   computing applications
SO JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYSICS
AB Multi-tone microwave signals are crucial for advanced quantum computing applications, including frequency-multiplexed qubit control and simultaneous two-qubit gate execution. However, interference among microwave signal components can cause signal amplitudes to surpass the output limits of an arbitrary waveform generator (AWG), hindering the generation of precise signals necessary for accurate qubit manipulation. To address this issue, we introduce a method that adjusts the phase of individual microwave signal components, effectively reducing interference and maintaining signal amplitude within the AWG's operational range.

TI Unveiling Quantum Entanglement in Many-Body Systems from Partial
   Information
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB Quantum entanglement is commonly assumed to be a central resource for quantum computing and quantum simulation. Nonetheless, the capability to detect it in many-body systems is severely limited by the absence of sufficiently scalable and flexible certification tools. This issue is particularly critical in situations where the structure of entanglement is a priori unknown, and where one cannot rely on existing entanglement witnesses. Here, we implement a scheme in which the knowledge of the mean value of arbitrary observables can be used to probe multipartite entanglement in a scalable, certified, and systematic manner. Specifically, we rely on positive semidefinite conditions, independent of partial-transpositionbased criteria, necessarily obeyed if the data can be reproduced by a separable state. The violation of any of these conditions yields a specific entanglement witness, tailored to the data of interest, revealing the salient features of the data which are impossible to reproduce without entanglement. We validate this approach by probing theoretical many-body states of several hundreds of qubits relevant to existing experiments: a single-particle quench in a one-dimensional XX chain; a many-body quench in a two-dimensional XX model with 1/r(3) interactions; and thermal equilibrium states of Heisenberg and transverse-field Ising chains. In all cases, these investigations have led us to discover new entanglement witnesses, some of which could be characterized analytically, generalizing existing results in the literature. In summary, our paper introduces a flexible data-driven entanglement detection technique for uncharacterized quantum many-body states, of immediate relevance to experiments in a quantum advantage regime.

TI Adaptive neural network for quantum error mitigation
SO QUANTUM MACHINE INTELLIGENCE
AB Quantum computing holds transformative promise, but its realization is hindered by the inherent susceptibility of quantum computers to errors. Quantum error mitigation has proved to be an enabling way to reduce computational error in present noisy intermediate scale quantum computers. This research introduces an innovative approach to quantum error mitigation by leveraging machine learning, specifically employing adaptive neural networks. With experiment and simulations done on 127-qubit IBM superconducting quantum computer, we were able to develop and train a neural network architecture to dynamically adjust output expectation values based on error characteristics. The model leverages a prior classifier module outcome on simulated quantum circuits with errors, and the antecedent neural network regression module adapts its parameters and response to each error characteristics. Results demonstrate the adaptive neural network's efficacy in mitigating errors across diverse quantum circuits and noise models, showcasing its potential to surpass traditional error mitigation techniques with an accuracy of 99% using the fully adaptive neural network for quantum error mitigation. This work presents a significant application of classical machine learning methods towards enhancing the robustness and reliability of quantum computations, providing a pathway for the practical realization of quantum computing technologies.

TI Predicting Flow in Fracture Networks With Quantum Algorithms
SO WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH
AB Uncertainty quantification plays a crucial role in the modeling of subsurface flow. For instance, uncertainties in the properties of geologic fracture networks significantly impact flow, requiring numerous simulations to accurately estimate quantities of interest. However, each simulation is computationally expensive because it requires solving a large linear system to capture features that involve both small and large fractures. An example is in percolation, where the interaction of many small fractures (which cumulatively can have a large surface area) with the rock matrix must be modeled precisely. Quantum computing is an emerging tool with the potential to address this issue. Quantum algorithms offer a significant speedup in solving linear systems, achieving efficiencies that are challenging to match with classical approaches. These classical approaches include direct solvers, such as LU decomposition, and iterative methods, notably preconditioned conjugate gradient, commonly used in subsurface modeling to solve large sparse systems. However, applying quantum algorithms to geologic fracture flow requires careful attention to algorithmic and problem-specific constraints to fully realize this quantum advantage. In this work we describe a quantum algorithm for generalized Monte Carlo applications with a quadratic speedup over the classical approaches which can be combined with the quantum speedup, currently under investigation, for solving quantum linear systems for subsurface flow. We show that for quantum algorithms the computational cost of estimating a quantity of interest for a statistical ensemble of networks is roughly the same as that of a single realization, essentially implying that one can get uncertainty quantification for free.

For most quantum simulations, the targeted state will obey several symmetries inherent to the system Hamiltonian. We obtain an alternative symmetry projected basis of measurement that reduces the number of measurements needed by a constant factor. Our scheme can be implemented at no additional cost on a quantum computer, can be implemented under various measurement or tomography schemes, and is reasonably resilient under noise.

TI Improved Iterative Quantum Algorithm for Ground-State Preparation
SO ADVANCED QUANTUM TECHNOLOGIES
AB Finding the ground state of a Hamiltonian system is of great significance in many-body quantum physics and quantum chemistry. An improved iterative quantum algorithm to prepare the ground state of a Hamiltonian is proposed. The crucial point is to optimize a cost function on the state space via the quantum gradient descent (QGD) implemented on quantum devices. Practical guideline on the selection of the learning rate in QGD are provided by finding a fundamental upper bound and establishing a relationship between the algorithm and the first-order approximation of the imaginary time evolution. Furthermore, a variational quantum state preparation method is adapted as a subroutine to generate an ancillary state by utilizing only polylogarithmic quantum resources. The performance of the algorithm is demonstrated by numerical calculations of the deuteron molecule and Heisenberg model without and with noises. Compared with the existing algorithms, the approach has advantages including the higher success probability at each iteration, the measurement precision-independent sampling complexity, the lower gate complexity, and only quantum resources are required when the ancillary state is well prepared.

TI Free-space quantum key distribution transmitter system using WDM filter
   for channel integration
SO ETRI JOURNAL
AB In this study, we report a transmitter system for free-space quantum key distribution (QKD) using the BB84 protocol, which does not require an internal alignment process, by using a wavelength-division multiplexing (WDM) filter and polarization-encoding module. With a custom-made WDM filter, the signals required for QKD can be integrated by simply connecting fibers, thus avoiding the laborious internal alignment required for free-space QKD systems using conventional bulk-optic setups. The WDM filter is designed to multiplex the single-mode signals from 785-nm quantum and 1550-nm synchronization channels for spatial-mode matching while maintaining the polarization relations. The measured insertion loss and isolation are 1.8 dB and 32.6 dB for 785 nm and 0.7 dB and 28.3 dB for 1550 nm, respectively. We also evaluate the QKD performance of the proposed system. The sifted key rate and quantum bit error rate are 1.6 Mbps and 0.62%, respectively, at an operating speed of 100 MHz, rendering our system comparable to conventional systems using bulk-optic devices for channel integration.

AB Contextuality is a phenomenon at the heart of quantum mechanics different from classical behavior and has been recently identified as a resource in quantum information processing. Experimental demonstration of contextuality is thus an important goal. We experimentally demonstrate a test of state-independent contextuality in a four-dimensional Hilbert space with single photons and violate the inequality by at least 387 standard deviations. Despite imperfections and possible measurement disturbance, our results cannot be explained in non-contextual models. We also provide a theoretical analysis of a test of contextuality with a coherent light field and show how the definitions affect the emergence of non-classical correlations. Our result sheds new light on the conflict between quantum and classical physics.

TI Programmable photonic integrated meshes for modular generation of
   optical entanglement links
SO NPJ QUANTUM INFORMATION
AB Large-scale generation of quantum entanglement between individually controllable qubits is at the core of quantum computing, communications, and sensing. Modular architectures of remotely-connected quantum technologies have been proposed for a variety of physical qubits, with demonstrations reported in atomic and all-photonic systems. However, an open challenge in these architectures lies in constructing high-speed and high-fidelity reconfigurable photonic networks for optically-heralded entanglement among target qubits. Here we introduce a programmable photonic integrated circuit (PIC), realized in a piezo-actuated silicon nitride (SiN)-in-oxide CMOS-compatible process, that implements an N x N Mach-Zehnder mesh (MZM) capable of high-speed execution of linear optical transformations. The visible-spectrum photonic integrated mesh is programmed to generate optical connectivity on up to N = 8 inputs for a range of optically-heralded entanglement protocols. In particular, we experimentally demonstrated optical connections between 16 independent pairwise mode couplings through the MZM, with optical transformation fidelities averaging 0.991 +/- 0.0063. The PIC's reconfigurable optical connectivity suffices for the production of 8-qubit resource states as building blocks of larger topological cluster states for quantum computing. Our programmable PIC platform enables the fast and scalable optical switching technology necessary for network-based quantum information processors.

TI Adaptive Modulation for Continuous-Variable Quantum Key Distribution
   With Real Local Oscillators Under Phase Attack
SO IEEE PHOTONICS JOURNAL
AB Continuous-variable quantum key distribution (CV-QKD) with a real local oscillator (LO) experiences a phase attack security challenge due to the reference pulses transmitted along with quantum signals over an unsecure quantum channel. In this paper, a phase attack on reference pulses of CV-QKD with a real LO is investigated. The performance of the discrete-modulated (DM) CV-QKD under this attack is analyzed analytically and by simulation, and compared with the Gaussian-modulated (GM) CV-QKD. It is found that such an attack by an eavesdropper's, significantly reduce the transmission distance for the GM based CV-QKD, whereas, the DMbased CV-QKD shows a high tolerance to high phase noise. Based on phase attack monitoring, a new adaptive modulation scheme is proposed for CV-QKDto adaptively switch between GM and DM so as to maintain the optimum secret key rate.

TI Uncertainty of feed forward neural networks recognizing quantum

SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICS A-MATHEMATICAL AND THEORETICAL
AB The usual figure of merit characterizing the performance of neural networks applied to problems in the quantum domain is their accuracy, being the probability of a correct answer on a previously unseen input. Here we append this parameter with the uncertainty of the prediction, characterizing the degree of confidence in the answer. A powerful technique for estimating uncertainty is provided by Bayesian neural networks (BNNs). We first give simple illustrative examples of advantages brought forward by BNNs, out of which we wish to highlight their ability of reliable uncertainty estimation even after training with biased datasets. Then we apply BNNs to the problem of recognition of quantum contextuality, which shows that the uncertainty itself is an independent parameter identifying the chance of misclassification of contextuality.

TI Multipartite quantum cryptography based on the violation of Svetlichny's
   inequality
SO EUROPEAN PHYSICAL JOURNAL D
AB Multipartite cryptography is useful for some particular missions. In this paper, we present a quantum key distribution scheme in which three separated observers can securely share a set of keys by using a sequence of 3-particle GHZ states. We prove that the violation of Svetlichny's inequality can be utilized to test for eavesdropping, and even when the eavesdropper can completely control the outcomes of two participants' measurements, our scheme still ensures the security of the keys distribution. This scheme can be easily extended to the case of N-party keys distribution, and the violation of N-partite Svetlichny's inequality guarantees the security of the generalized scheme. Since the GHZ state has maximum entanglement, its perfect monogamy guarantee the device-independent security of our protocol. However, quantum entanglement is a vulnerable resource which is often decayed during transmission, so we need here to derive the secret-key rate of our protocol under the condition of using quantum states with non-maximal entanglement. We then calculate the extractable secret-key rate of the three-party key distribution protocol for the Werner state in the device-independent scenario. We find that the value of the extractable secret-key rate monotonously approaches 1 as the value of the visibility of the Werner state increases, and it reaches its maximum value 1 when the Werner state becomes the GHZ state.

TI Entanglement swapping using hyperentangled pairs of two-level neutral
   atoms
SO IET QUANTUM COMMUNICATION
AB Hyperentangled swapping is a quantum communication technique that involves the exchange of hyperentangled states, which are quantum states entangled in multiple degrees of freedom, to enable secure and efficient quantum information transfer. In this paper, we demonstrate schematics for the hyperentanglement swapping between separate pairs of neutral atoms through the mathematical framework of atomic Bragg diffraction, which is efficient and resistant to decoherence, yielding deterministic results with superior overall fidelity. The utilised cavities are in a superposition state and interact with the incoming atoms off-resonantly. Quantum information carried by the cavities is swapped through resonant interactions with two-level auxiliary atoms. We also discuss entanglement swapping under a delayed-choice scenario and provide a schematic generalisation covering multiple-qubit scenarios. Finally, we introduce specific experimental parameters to demonstrate the experimental feasibility of the scheme.

TI Hybrid Approach to Mitigate Errors in Linear Photonic Bell-State
   Measurement for Quantum Interconnects
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB Optical quantum information processing relies critically on Bell-state measurement, a ubiquitous operation for quantum communication and computing. Its practical realization involves the interference of optical modes and the detection of a single photon in an indistinguishable manner. Yet, in the absence of efficient photon-number-resolution capabilities, errors arise from multiphoton components, decreasing the overall process fidelity. Here, we introduce a hybrid detection scheme for Bell-state measurement, leveraging both on-off single-photon detection and quadrature conditioning via homodyne detection. We derive explicit fidelities for quantum teleportation and entanglement-swapping processes employing this strategy, demonstrating its efficacy. We also compare with photon-number-resolving detectors and find a strong advantage of the hybrid scheme in a wide range of parameters. This work provides a new tool for linear-optics schemes, with applications to quantum state engineering and quantum interconnects.

TI Robust implementation of generative modeling with parametrized quantum
   circuits
SO QUANTUM MACHINE INTELLIGENCE
AB Although the performance of hybrid quantum-classical algorithms is highly dependent on the selection of the classical optimizer and the circuit ansatze (Benedetti et al, npj Quantum Inf 5:45, 2019; Hamilton et al, 2018; Zhu et al, 2018), a robust and thorough assessment on-hardware of such features has been missing to date. From the optimizer perspective, the primary challenge lies in the solver's stochastic nature, and their significant variance over the random initialization. Therefore, a robust comparison requires one to perform several training curves for each solver before one can reach conclusions about their typical performance. Since each of the training curves requires the execution of thousands of quantum circuits in the quantum computer, such a robust study remained a steep challenge for most hybrid platforms available today. Here, we leverage on Rigetti's Quantum Cloud Services (QCS (TM)) to overcome this implementation barrier, and we study the on-hardware performance of the data-driven quantum circuit learning (DDQCL) for three different state-of-the-art classical solvers, and on two-different circuit ansatze associated to different entangling connectivity graphs for the same task. Additionally, we assess the gains in performance from varying circuit depths. To evaluate the typical performance associated with each of these settings in this benchmark study, we use at least five independent runs of DDQCL towards the generation of quantum generative models capable of capturing the patterns of the canonical Bars and Stripes dataset. In this experimental benchmarking, the gradient-free optimization algorithms show an outstanding performance compared to the gradient-based solver. In particular, one of them had better performance when handling the unavoidable noisy objective function to be minimized under experimental conditions.

TI Optimal calibration of gates in trapped-ion quantum computers
SO QUANTUM SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB To harness the power of quantum computing, it is essential that a quantum computer provide maximal possible fidelity for a quantum circuit. To this end, much work has been done in the context of qubit routing or embedding, i.e., mapping circuit qubits to physical qubits based on gate performance metrics to optimize the fidelity of execution. Here, we take an alternative approach that leverages a unique capability of a trapped-ion quantum computer, i.e., the all-to-all qubit connectivity. We develop a method to determine a fixed number (budget) of quantum gates that, when calibrated, will maximize the fidelity of a batch of input quantum programs. This dynamic allocation of calibration resources on randomly accessible gates, determined using our heuristics, increases, for a wide range of calibration budget, the average fidelity from 70% or lower to 90% or higher for a typical batch of jobs on an 11-qubit device, in which the fidelity of calibrated and uncalibrated gates are taken to be 99% and 90%, respectively. Our heuristics are scalable, more than 2.5 orders of magnitude faster than a randomized method for synthetic benchmark circuits generated based on real-world use cases.

TI Observation of Genuine High-dimensional Multi-partite Non-locality in
   Entangled Photon States
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Quantum information science has leaped forward with the exploration of high-dimensional quantum systems, offering greater potential than traditional qubits in quantum communication and quantum computing. To advance the field of high-dimensional quantum technology, a significant effort is underway to progressively enhance the entanglement dimension between two particles. An alternative effective strategy involves not only increasing the dimensionality but also expanding the number of particles that are entangled. We present an experimental study demonstrating multi-partite quantum non-locality beyond qubit constraints, thus moving into the realm of strongly entangled high-dimensional multi-particle quantum systems. In the experiment, quantum states were encoded in the path degree of freedom (DoF) and controlled via polarization, enabling efficient operations in a two-dimensional plane to prepare three- and four-particle Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) states in three-level systems. Our experimental results reveal ways in which high-dimensional systems can surpass qubits in terms of violating local-hidden-variable theories. Our realization of multiple complex and high-quality entanglement technologies is an important primary step for more complex quantum computing and communication protocols.

We treatthe quantum interference between the electron coupling pathways froma donor with two degenerate excited states to an acceptor and analyzethe transfer efficiency. We also examine the potential error sourcesthat enter the quantum simulations. The trapped-ion systems have favorablescalings with system size compared to those of classical computers,promising access to richer electron-transfer simulations.

TI Nonlocality in quantum cloning states
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB This study investigates the nonlocality characteristics of output states produced by a universal quantum cloning machine, with particular emphasis on the Bell-CHSH inequality violations exhibited by the two-qubit reduced states of cloned outputs. Through systematic analysis, we identify the parameter regimes where these reduced states can effectively serve as quantum channels for teleportation protocols. Our results demonstrate that within specific operational ranges of the cloning machine parameters, the two-qubit reduced states are suitable for quantum teleportation but do not exhibit violations of Bell-CHSH inequalities. Furthermore, we quantitatively characterize the monogamy relations governing Bell-CHSH violations in quantum cloning states across different parameter configurations, revealing fundamental constraints on nonlocality distribution in cloned quantum systems.

TI High-fidelity n-qubit quantum controlled-not gates on quantum-dot spins
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB Realizing high-fidelity n-qubit quantum controlled-not gates is of critical significance. Applying quantum-dot (QD) spins as qubits, an (n - 1)-qubit control 1-qubit not gate and a 1-qubit control (n - 1)-qubit not gate is constructed. By utilizing the balanced condition, even under the condition of weak coupling, the circuit including the wave-form correctors and the balanced reflection condition of the cavity may effectively reduce the noise resulting from the unequal reflectance, so that the fidelity of each quantum gate operation can be increased to unity in theory. The operational complexity is further reduced, considering that low-Q cavities are used. In addition, the control gate of m-qubit control (n - m)-qubit can also be performed with a similar device diagram, only by changing the numbers of the control qubits and target qubits. These n-qubit controlled-not gates can help construct simpler quantum computing circuits that can be widely applied in quantum information processing.

AB Distributed quantum computing (DQC) is a scalable way to build a large-scale quantum computing system. Previous compilers for DQC focus on either qubit-to-qubit inter-node gates or qubit-to-node nonlocal circuit blocks, missing opportunities of optimizing collective communication which consists of nonlocal gates over multiple nodes. In this paper, we observe that by utilizing patterns of collective communication, we can greatly reduce the amount of inter-node communication required to implement a group of nonlocal gates. We propose QuComm, the first compiler framework which unveils and analyzes collective communication patterns hidden in distributed quantum programs and efficiently routes inter-node gates on any DQC architecture based on discovered patterns, cutting down the overall communication cost of the target program. We also provide the first formalization of the communication buffer concept in DQC compiling. The communication buffer utilizes data qubits to store remote entanglement so that we can ensure enough communication resources on any DQC architecture to support the proposed optimizations for collective communication. Experimental results show that, compared to the state-of-the-art baseline, QuComm reduces the amount of inter-node communication by 54.9% on average, over various distributed quantum programs and DQC hardware configurations.

SO NATURAL COMPUTING
AB We study algorithms for solving a problem of constructing a text (a long string) from a dictionary (a sequence of small strings). The problem has an application in bioinformatics and has a connection with the sequence assembly method for reconstructing a long DNA sequence from small fragments. Our problem is the construction a string t of length n using strings s(1), ... , s(m) with possible overlapping. Firstly, we provide a classical (randomized) algorithm with running time O(n + L + m(log n)(2) (O) over tilde (n+L) where L is the sum of lengths of s(1), ... , s(m). Secondly, we provide a quantum algorithm with running time O(n+log n . (logm + log log n) . root m.L) = (O) over tilde (n+root m.L). Additionally, we show that the lower bound for a classical (randomized or deterministic) algorithm is Omega(n + L). Thus, our classical algorithm is optimal up to a log factor, and our quantum algorithm shows a speed-up when compared with any classical (randomized or deterministic) algorithm in the case of non-constant length of strings in the dictionary.

TI Nearly Optimal Quantum Algorithm for Generating the Ground State of a
   Free Quantum Field Theory
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB We devise a quasilinear quantum algorithm for generating an approximation for the ground state of a quantum field theory (QFT). Our quantum algorithm delivers a superquadratic speedup over the state-of-the-art quantum algorithm for ground-state generation, overcomes the ground-state-generation bottleneck of the prior approach and is optimal up to a polylogarithmic factor. Specifically, we establish two quantum algorithms-Fourier-based and wavelet-based-to generate the ground state of a free massive scalar bosonic QFT with gate complexity quasilinear in the number of discretized QFT modes. The Fourier-based algorithm is limited to translationally invariant QFTs. Numerical simulations show that the wavelet-based algorithm successfully yields the ground state for a QFT with broken translational invariance. Furthermore, the cost of preparing particle excitations in the wavelet approach is independent of the energy scale. Our algorithms require a routine for generating one-dimensional Gaussian (1DG) states. We replace the standard method for 1DG-state generation, which requires the quantum computer to perform lots of costly arithmetic, with a novel method based on inequality testing that significantly reduces the need for arithmetic. Our method for 1DG-state generation is generic and could be extended to preparing states whose amplitudes can be computed on the fly by a quantum computer.

TI Real-Time Adaptive Sensing of Nuclear Spins by a Single-Spin Quantum
   Sensor
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW APPLIED
AB Quantum sensing is considered to be one of the most promising subfields of quantum information to deliver practical quantum advantages in real-world applications. However, its impressive capabilities, including high sensitivity, are often hindered by the limited quantum resources available. Here, we incorporate the expected information gain (EIG) and techniques such as accelerated computation into Bayesian experimental design (BED) in order to use quantum resources more efficiently. A simulated nitrogenvacancy center in diamond is used to demonstrate real-time operation of the BED. Instead of heuristics, the EIG is used to choose optimal control parameters in real time. Moreover, combining the BED with accelerated computation and asynchronous operations, we find that up to a tenfold speedup in absolute time cost can be achieved in sensing multiple surrounding 13C nuclear spins. Our work explores the possibilities of applying the EIG to BED-based quantum-sensing tasks and provides techniques useful to integrate BED into more generalized quantum sensing systems.

TI Microwave-activated high-fidelity three-qubit gate scheme for
   fixed-frequency superconducting qubits
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW APPLIED
AB Scalable superconducting quantum processors require balancing critical constraints in coherence, control complexity, and spectral crowding. Fixed-frequency architectures suppress flux noise and simplify control via all-microwave operations but remain limited by residual ZZ crosstalk. Here we propose a microwave-activated three-qubit gate protocol for fixed-frequency transmon qubits in the large-detuning regime (|Delta| >> g), leveraging the third-order nonlinear interaction to coherently exchange |001) <leftwards arrow with vertical stroke> |110) states. By incorporating a phase-compensated optimization protocol, numerical simulations demonstrate a high average gate fidelity exceeding 99.9%. Systematic error analysis identifies static long-range ZZ coupling as the dominant error source in multiqubit systems, which can be suppressed via operations in the large-detuning regime (approximately 1 GHz). The protocol maintains process fidelities exceeding 98% under decoherence, while demonstrating intrinsic robustness to fabrication-induced parameter variations and compatibility with existing all-microwave two-qubit gate architectures. This hardware-efficient strategy advances scalable quantum computing systems by improving coherence properties, reducing spectral congestion, and expanding the experimental toolkit for error-resilient quantum operations in the noisy intermediate-scale quantum era.

TI Optimized low-depth quantum circuits for molecular electronic structure
   using a separable-pair approximation
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB We present a classically tractable model that leads to optimized low-depth quantum circuits leveraging separable-pair approximations. The obtained circuits are well suited as a baseline circuit for emerging quantum hardware and can, in the long term, provide significantly improved initial states for quantum algorithms. The associated wave functions can be represented with linear memory requirement, which allows classical optimization of the circuits and naturally defines a minimum benchmark for quantum algorithms. In this work we employ directly determined pair-natural orbitals within a basis-set-free approach. This leads to accurate representation of the one- and many-body parts for weakly correlated systems and we explicitly illustrate how the model can be integrated into other quantum algorithms for stronger correlated systems.

TI Quantum minimal surfaces from quantum error correction
SO SCIPOST PHYSICS
AB We show that complementary state-specific reconstruction of logical (bulk) operators is equivalent to the existence of a quantum minimal surface prescription for physical (boundary) entropies. This significantly generalizes both sides of an equivalence previously shown by Harlow [1]; in particular, we do not require the entanglement wedge to be the same for all states in the code space. In developing this theorem, we construct an emergent bulk geometry for general quantum codes, defining "areas" associated to arbitrary logical subsystems, and argue that this definition is "functionally unique." We also formalize a definition of bulk reconstruction that we call "state-specific product unitary" reconstruction. This definition captures the quantum error correction (QEC) properties present in holographic codes and has potential independent interest as a very broad generalization of QEC; it includes most traditional versions of QEC as special cases. Our results extend to approximate codes, and even to the "non-isometric codes" that seem to describe the interior of a black hole at late times.

TI Experimental Investigation of Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen Steering (Invited)
SO ACTA OPTICA SINICA
AB Significance Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR) steering, originating from the famous EPR paradox, describes the process that the state of one party's system could be affected by the other party's choice of measurement. As a distinct category in the hierarchy of quantum correlations, EPR steering manifests quantum correlations that are stronger than quantum entanglement yet weaker than Bell nonlocality. With the inherent directionality, EPR steering reveals the asymmetric nature of quantum nonlocal correlations and it is even possible to enable one-way EPR steering. Compared with the symmetric correlation in quantum entanglement and the statistical correlation verification of Bell nonlocality, the distinctive phenomenon of quantum steering deepens our understanding of quantum fundamentals, such as the asymmetric feature of quantum nonlocality, the concepts of reality and locality, and the completeness of quantum measurement. It also expands the application scenarios of quantum nonlocality in quantum information processing including the one-side device-independent quantum key distribution and the verification for quantum channels and entanglement. The investigation of EPR steering is a crucial endeavor for bridging the gap between the abstract foundations of quantum theory and the practical engineering of quantum technologies. Progress This article systematically reviews the investigations of EPR steering, focusing on the experimental perspective, particularly a series of works by our group based on the quantum photonic experimental platform which are introduced below. First, we demonstrate the EPR steering based on the all-versus-nothing criterion which says that Bob's normalized conditional states can be regarded as two different pure states corresponding to the two eigenvalues of the projective measurement by Alice. Within this all-versus-nothing criterion framework, we establish a method for handling experimental errors due to the impossible pure state in experiment. This work rigorously and logically experimentally verifies the quantum steering process from Alice to Bob without inequalities rendering the detection of correlations leading to a violation of steering inequalities unnecessary. This work also reveals the profound contradiction between quantum steering and classical physics. It offers a new perspective for understanding this form of quantum nonlocality, provides a scheme for remote quantum state preparation, and advances the verification of quantum steering in high-dimensional quantum systems. Second, we propose a theoretical tool to quantify EPR steering and perform the experiment to implement the asymmetric property of EPR steering and even the one-way EPR steering. The theoretical tool is called as the quantum steering radius which is constructed based on the local hidden-state model. Shown in Fig. 3, if the steering radius is larger than 1, then at least one local hidden state is beyond the Bloch sphere, which means there is no physical local hidden state and Alice could successfully steer Bob's state. Otherwise, Bob could find the local hidden states to reconstruct his conditional states and Alice fails to steer his state remotely. This work provides an intuitive and understandable perspective for understanding asymmetric quantum nonlocality and lays the foundation for the application of quantum steering in asymmetric quantum information tasks.
   Moreover, within the two-qubit system, we demonstrate the effect of local filter on the EPR steering, especially this operation on one-way EPR steering, where the information discarded during the local filter operation still possesses the property of EPR steering and can be reused to build new communication links. As shown in Fig. 4, by applying local filter operations to EPR steering, it can efficiently regulate its asymmetric properties, including reversing the directionality of one-way EPR steering and amplifying the asymmetry of EPR steering. It also could simultaneously demonstrate all structural forms of EPR steering with the suitable local filter operations. These new operation methods enrich the tools of manipulating quantum resources and have potential important applications in the construction of quantum communication networks. We further extend the two-qubit system to the multi-partite quantum system in which the EPR steering relationship between different subsystems is constrained by the monogamy. For example, in a three-qubit system consisting of Alice, Bob, and Charlie, the monogamy of EPR steering means the state of Alice can't be steered by Bob and Charlie simultaneously. Within a three-qubit system, as shown in Fig. 5, we experimentally demonstrate the shareability of multi-partite EPR steering breaking through the monogamy limitation with increasing the number of measurement settings. The outcome of this work is an important step in understanding multi-partite EPR steering and has potential applications in quantum information protocols. Besides the fundamental features of EPR steering, we further study its applications in the quantum information tasks. For example, with the EPR steering resource, as illustrated in Fig. 6, we demonstrate the subchannel discrimination task implemented with the help of an experimental Sagnac interferometer, where EPR steering can be necessarily and sufficiently characterized. That is, the EPR steering state can increase the success probability of subchannel discrimination; conversely, if the success probability of discrimination using a certain quantum state is higher than that using a single qubit state, it can be proved that this quantum state is a EPR steering state. This work clearly reveals the differences between quantum entanglement and EPR steering at the operational level. Before the application of EPR steering in practice, the evolution of EPR steering in open systems should be investigated since its properties would be affected by the environment. Experimentally, we use photon's frequency as the medium for coupling the quantum system with the environment, and utilize birefringent crystals of different lengths to achieve dynamic evolution at different time scales. We observe the evolution process of EPR steering in two environments, as shown in Fig. 7, and find that in the non-Markov environment, both EPR steering and quantum entanglement undergo a process of gradually weakening to disappearance and then recovering. In the Markov environment, both gradually disappeared and failed to recover. This work utilizes the memory effect of non-Markov processes to recover the information of EPR steering lost to the environment and paves the step to the application of EPR steering in open systems. Conclusions and Prospects With the thorough properties of EPR steering in simple quantum systems, however, there is still a vast space for investigating characteristics of EPR steering in high-dimensional many-body systems which possess unique advantages.
   Growing interest is now focused on the manipulation of EPR steering, in addition to its fundamental properties. The effective manipulation of EPR steering not only helps to deepen the understanding of physical connotations but also provides new resources for quantum information tasks. In conclusion, the physical nature of EPR steering in high-dimensional many-body systems requires further exploration, as well as more rigorous experimental validation of its practical utility.

TI Reconfigurable quantum photonic circuits based on quantum dots
SO NANOPHOTONICS
AB Quantum photonic integrated circuits, composed of linear-optical elements, offer an efficient way for encoding and processing quantum information on-chip. At their core, these circuits rely on reconfigurable phase shifters, typically constructed from classical components such as thermo- or electro-optical materials, while quantum solid-state emitters such as quantum dots are limited to acting as single-photon sources. Here, we demonstrate the potential of quantum dots as reconfigurable phase shifters. We use numerical models based on established literature parameters to show that circuits utilizing these emitters enable high-fidelity operation and are scalable. Despite the inherent imperfections associated with quantum dots, such as imperfect coupling, dephasing, or spectral diffusion, we show that circuits based on these emitters may be optimized such that these do not significantly impact the unitary infidelity. Specifically, they do not increase the infidelity by more than 0.001 in circuits with up to 10 modes, compared to those affected only by standard nanophotonic losses and routing errors. For example, we achieve fidelities of 0.9998 in quantum-dot-based circuits enacting controlled-phase and - not gates without any redundancies. These findings demonstrate the feasibility of quantum emitter-driven quantum information processing and pave the way for cryogenically-compatible, fast, and low-loss reconfigurable quantum photonic circuits.

TI Coherent spin qubit transport in silicon
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB A fault-tolerant quantum processor may be configured using stationary qubits interacting only with their nearest neighbours, but at the cost of significant overheads in physical qubits per logical qubit. Such overheads could be reduced by coherently transporting qubits across the chip, allowing connectivity beyond immediate neighbours. Here we demonstrate high-fidelity coherent transport of an electron spin qubit between quantum dots in isotopically-enriched silicon. We observe qubit precession in the inter-site tunnelling regime and assess the impact of qubit transport using Ramsey interferometry and quantum state tomography techniques. We report a polarization transfer fidelity of 99.97% and an average coherent transfer fidelity of 99.4%. Our results provide key elements for high-fidelity, on-chip quantum information distribution, as long envisaged, reinforcing the scaling prospects of silicon-based spin qubits. Long-range coherent spin-qubit transfer between semiconductor quantum dots requires understanding and control over associated errors. Here, the authors achieve high-fidelity coherent state transfer in a Si double quantum dot, underpinning the prospects of a large-scale quantum computer.

TI THz quantum gap: exploring potential approaches for generating and
   detecting non-classical states of THz light
SO NANOPHOTONICS
AB Over the past few decades, THz technology has made considerable progress, evidenced by the performance of current THz sources and detectors, as well as the emergence of several THz applications. However, in the realm of quantum technologies, the THz spectral domain is still in its infancy, unlike neighboring spectral domains that have flourished in recent years. Notably, in the microwave domain, superconducting qubits currently serve as the core of quantum computers, while quantum cryptography protocols have been successfully demonstrated in the visible and telecommunications domains through satellite links. The THz domain has lagged behind in these impressive advancements. Today, the current gap in the THz domain clearly concerns quantum technologies. Nonetheless, the emergence of quantum technologies operating at THz frequencies will potentially have a significant impact. Indeed, THz radiation holds significant promise for wireless communications with ultimate security owing to its low sensitivity to atmospheric disturbances. Moreover, it has the potential to raise the operating temperature of solid-state qubits, effectively addressing existing scalability issues. In addition, THz radiation can manipulate the quantum states of molecules, which are recognized as new platforms for quantum computation and simulation with long range interactions. Finally, its ability to penetrate generally opaque materials or its resistance to Rayleigh scattering are very appealing features for quantum sensing. In this perspective, we will discuss potential approaches that offer exciting prospects for generating and detecting non-classical states of THz light, thereby opening doors to significant breakthroughs in THz quantum technologies.

TI High-fidelity quantum teleportation through noisy channels via weak
   measurement and environment-assisted measurement
SO RESULTS IN PHYSICS
AB A perfect teleportation protocol requires pure maximally shared entangled states. While in reality the shared entanglement is drastically degraded due to the inevitable interaction with the noisy environment. Here, we propose a teleportation protocol to teleport an unknown qubit through amplitude damping channels with a fidelity up to one with a single copy of the entangled state. Our proposed teleportation protocol, while illustrated using the Bell and W entangled states as examples, can be utilized with any type of entangled states. In our protocol, we utilize environment-assisted measurement (EAM) during the entanglement distribution, and further modify the original teleportation protocol to apply weak measurement in the last step of teleportation. We find a balance between teleportation fidelity and success probability by varying the strength of the weak measurement. Furthermore, we investigate the protection of third-party assisted teleportation protocols, where all the qubits of the entangled state pass through the amplitude damping channel. In particular, for the third-party assisted teleportation with the W state, the decoherence of the shared entanglement can be totally suppressed by using EAM, hence no weak measurement is required to achieve an average teleportation fidelity of unity. The numerical simulation results reveal that our proposed teleportation protocol outperforms both the weak measurement based probabilistic teleportation protocol and the original teleportation protocols without protection.

TI The hybrid topological longitudinal transmon qubit
SO MATERIALS FOR QUANTUM TECHNOLOGY
AB We introduce a new hybrid qubit consisting of a Majorana qubit interacting with a transmon longitudinally coupled to a resonator. To do so, we equip the longitudinal transmon qubit with topological quasiparticles, supported by an array of heterostructure nanowires, and derive charge- and phase-based interactions between the Majorana qubit and the resonator and transmon degrees of freedom. Inspecting the charge coupling, we demonstrate that the Majorana self-charging can be eliminated by a judicious choice of charge offset, thereby maintaining the Majorana degeneracy regardless of the quasiparticles spatial arrangement and parity configuration. We perform analytic and numerical calculations to derive the effective qubit-qubit interaction elements and discuss their potential utility for state readout and quantum error correction. Further, we find that select interactions depend strongly on the overall superconducting parity, which may provide a direct mechanism to characterize deleterious quasiparticle poisoning processes.

TI The Degree of Quantum Contextuality in Terms of Concurrence for the KCBS
   Scenario
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF THEORETICAL PHYSICS
AB Quantum contextuality is the key concept which explains the fact that the result of a measurement is not independent of the context in which it is found. It is observed to be an intrinsic feature, i.e., neither entanglement nor spatial separation is required. In this work, we revisit the previous studies which state that entanglement is an intrinsic property called self-entanglement. Using this fact, we explicitly show the correlation between quantum contextuality and concurrence in the KCBS scenario, which is the simplest approach to observing contextuality. We also derive the equation for the maximal violation of the KCBS scenario for a given concurrence and find the linear relation between them. Using this relation, we also show how the maximal violations of the KCBS and CHSH inequalities are related for an arbitrary entanglement. Moreover, we discuss the special cases of maximal entanglement, and non-entanglement for which we have found a lower local bound.

TI Quantum sensing with tunable superconducting qubits: optimization and
   speed-up
SO NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB Sensing and metrology are crucial in both fundamental science and practical applications. They meet the constant demand for precise data, enabling more dependable assessments of theoretical models' validity. Sensors, now a common feature in many fields, play a vital role in applications like gravity imaging, geology, navigation, security, timekeeping, spectroscopy, chemistry, magnetometry, healthcare, and medicine. The advancements in quantum technologies have sparked interest in employing quantum systems as sensors, offering enhanced capabilities and new possibilities. This article describes the optimization of the quantum-enhanced sensing of magnetic fluxes with a Kitaev phase estimation algorithm based on frequency tunable transmon qubits. It provides the optimal flux biasing point for sensors with different qubit transition frequencies and gives an estimation of decoherence rates and achievable sensitivity. The use of 2- and 3-qubit entangled states are compared in simulation with the single-qubit case. The flux sensing accuracy reaches 10(-8)<middle dot> Phi 0 and scales inversely with time, which proves the speed-up of sensing with high ultimate accuracy.

TI Utilizing probabilistic entanglement between sensors in quantum networks
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW APPLIED
AB One of the most promising applications of quantum networks is entanglement-assisted sensing. The field of quantum metrology exploits quantum correlations to improve the precision bound for applications such as precision timekeeping, field sensing, and biological imaging. When measuring multiple spatially distributed parameters, current literature focuses on quantum entanglement in the discrete-variable case and quantum squeezing in the continuous-variable case, distributed amongst all of the sensors in a given network. However, it can be difficult to ensure that all sensors preshare entanglement of sufficiently high fidelity. This work probes the space between fully entangled and fully classical sensing networks by modeling a star network with probabilistic entanglement generation that is attempting to estimate the average of local parameters. The quantum Fisher information is used to determine which protocols best utilize entanglement as a resource for different network conditions. It is shown that without entanglement distillation there is a threshold fidelity below which classical sensing is preferable. For a network with a given number of sensors and links characterized by a certain initial fidelity and probability of success, this work outlines when and how to use entanglement, when to store it, and when it needs to be distilled.

AB The security of many commonly used cryptographic protocols, especially public-key cryptosystems, would be compromised if general-purpose, large-scale, fault-tolerant quantum computers become a reality. In this paper we present our experience developing and launching a course in Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC). PQC refers to cryptographic systems that are secure against both quantum and classical computers. Such systems may be achieved through classical (i.e. non-quantum) means.
   Because of progress in the design of quantum computers and the ongoing National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) process to develop post-quantum cryptographic systems, we realized that there is a need to design a course that covers the consequences of developments in quantum computing (QC), the threats of QC to currently used cryptographic schemes, and how to mitigate those threats by developing quantum-resistant schemes. We designed a new course that is attracting students interested in the future of cryptography and computing security/cybersecurity. We first offered it as an MS-level graduate course, also open to upper-level undergraduates, in Spring 2022, and followed with the second offering in Spring 2023. The course covers the PQC algorithm design process, the consequences of QC, some computationally hard problems and then discusses selected proposals for post-quantum cryptosystems designed to be resistant to known classical and quantum attacks. Three main types of such designs include lattice-based, code-based, and hash-based schemes. These three types are used both for key encapsulation methods (KEM) and digital signatures (DS), and more generally for encryption and authentication.

TI Classical capacities of memoryless but not identical quantum channels
SO REVIEWS IN MATHEMATICAL PHYSICS
AB We study quantum channels that vary on time in a deterministic way, that is, they change in an independent but not identical way from one to another use. We derive coding theorems for the entanglement-assisted and unassisted classical capacities. We then specialize the theory to lossy bosonic quantum channels and show the existence of contrasting examples where capacities can or cannot be drawn from the limiting behavior of the lossy parameter.

TI Optimal qubit circuits for quantum-enhanced telescopes
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB We propose two optimal phase-estimation schemes that can be used for quantum-enhanced long-baseline interferometry. By using distributed entanglement, it is possible to eliminate the loss of stellar photons during transmission over the baselines. The first protocol is a sequence of gates using nonlinear optical elements, optimized over all possible measurement schemes to saturate the Cramer-Rao bound. The second approach builds on an existing protocol, which encodes the time of arrival of the stellar photon into a quantum memory. Our modified version reduces both the number of ancilla qubits and the number of gate operations by a factor of two.

TI Indistinguishability-assisted two-qubit entanglement distillation
SO QUANTUM SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB Production of quantum states exhibiting a high degree of entanglement out of noisy conditions is one of the main goals of quantum information science. Here, we provide a conditional yet efficient entanglement distillation method which functions within the framework of spatially localized operations and classical communication. This method exploits indistinguishability effects due to the spatial overlap between two identical qubits in distinct sites and encompasses particle statistics imprint. We derive the general conditions for the maximum entanglement distillation out of mixed states. As applications, we give a thorough description of distilled entanglement and associated success probability starting from typical noisy states, such as thermal Gibbs states and Werner states. The influence of local temperatures and of a noise parameter is discussed, respectively, in these two cases. The proposed scheme paves the way towards quantum repeaters in composite networks made of controllable identical quantum particles.

TI Universal Measurement-Based Quantum Computation in a One-Dimensional
   Architecture Enabled by Dual-Unitary Circuits
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB A powerful tool emerging from the study of many -body quantum dynamics is that of dual -unitary circuits, which are unitary even when read "sideways, " i.e., along the spatial direction. Here, we show that this provides the ideal framework to understand and expand on the notion of measurement -based quantum computation (MBQC). In particular, applying a dual -unitary circuit to a many -body state followed by appropriate measurements effectively implements quantum computation in the spatial direction. We show how the dual -unitary dynamics generated by the dynamics of the paradigmatic one-dimensional kicked Ising chain with certain parameter choices generate resource states for universal deterministic MBQC. Specifically, after k time steps, equivalent to a depth - k quantum circuit, we obtain a resource state for universal MBQC on similar to 3 k/ 4 encoded qubits. Our protocol allows generic quantum circuits to be "rotated " in space-time and gives new ways to exchange between resources like qubit number and coherence time in quantum computers. Beyond the practical advantages, we also interpret the dual -unitary evolution as generating an infinite sequence of new symmetry -protected topological phases with spatially modulated symmetries, which gives a vast generalization of the well -studied one-dimensional cluster state and shows that our protocol is robust to symmetry -respecting deformations.

TI Solving the Bernstein-Vazirani problem using Majorana-based topological
   quantum algorithms
SO NPJ QUANTUM INFORMATION
AB Executing quantum algorithms using Majorana zero modes-a major milestone for the field of topological quantum computing-requires a platform that can be scaled to large quantum registers, can be controlled in real time and space, and a braiding protocol that uses the unique properties of these exotic particles. Here, we demonstrate the first successful simulation of a Majorana-based, fault-tolerant quantum algorithm to solve the Bernstein-Vazirani problem in two-dimensional magnet-superconductor hybrid structures from initialization to read-out of the final many-body state. Utilizing the Majorana zero modes' topological properties, we introduce an optimized braiding protocol for the algorithm and a scalable architecture for its implementation with an arbitrary number of qubits. We visualize the algorithm protocol in real time and space by computing the non-equilibrium density of states, which is proportional to the time-dependent differential conductance, and the non-equilibrium charge density, which assigns a unique signature to each final state of the algorithm.

TI Quantum entanglement between excitons in two-dimensional materials
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
AB The quantum entanglement between two excitons in two-dimensional materials, embedded in an optical microcavity, was investigated. The energy eigenstates of a Jaynes-Cummings like Hamiltonian for two qubits coupled to a single cavity mode have been calculated. The quantum entanglement between such states was estimated by calculating the concurrence between two qubits in each of these eigenstates. According to the results of our calculations, if the system is allowed to decay only through the emission of cavity photons at low temperatures, then there is a maximally entangled eigenstate, protected from decay. We demonstrated that the existence of such a state results in the counterintuitive conclusion that, for some initial states of the system, the fact that the cavity is leaky can actually lead to an increase in the average concurrence on the timescales of the average photonic lifetime. By briefly analyzing the three-qubit model, we have demonstrated that the probability for the entanglement to be preserved is enhanced when the number of qubits is increased. In addition, we calculated the time evolution of the concurrence between a pair of excitons in a strained graphene monolayer.

TI Improved Single-Shot Qubit Readout Using Twin rf-SET Charge Correlations
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB High-fidelity qubit readout is critical in order to obtain the thresholds needed to implement quantum error-correction protocols and achieve fault-tolerant quantum computing. Large-scale silicon qubit devices will have densely packed arrays of quantum dots with multiple charge sensors that are, on average, farther away from the quantum dots, entailing a reduction in readout fidelities. Here, we present a readout technique that enhances the readout fidelity in a linear SiMOS four-dot array by amplifying correlations between a pair of single-electron transistors, known as a twin SET. By recording and subsequently correlating the twin SET traces as we modulate the dot detuning across a charge transition, we demonstrate a reduction in the charge readout infidelity by over one order of magnitude compared to traditional readout methods. We also study the spin-to-charge conversion errors introduced by the modulation technique and conclude that faster modulation frequencies avoid relaxation-induced errors without introducing significant spin-flip errors, favoring the use of the technique at short integration times. This method not only allows for faster and higher-fidelity qubit measurements but it also enhances the signal corresponding to charge transitions that take place farther away from the sensors, enabling a way to circumvent the reduction in readout fidelities in large arrays of qubits.

TI Quantum entanglement recognition
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Entanglement constitutes a key characteristic feature of quantum matter. Its detection, however, still faces major challenges. In this paper, we formulate a framework for probing entanglement based on machine learning techniques. The central element is a protocol for the generation of statistical images from quantum many-body states, with which we perform image classification by means of convolutional neural networks. We show that the resulting quantum entanglement recognition task is accurate and can be assigned a well-controlled error across a wide range of quantum states. We discuss the potential use of our scheme to quantify quantum entanglement in experiments. Our developed scheme provides a generally applicable strategy for quantum entanglement recognition in both equilibrium and nonequilibrium quantum matter.

TI Alternative schemes for twin-field quantum key distribution with
   discrete-phase-randomized sources
SO FRONTIERS IN PHYSICS
AB The twin-field quantum key distribution (TF-QKD) protocol and its variants can overcome the well-known rate-loss bound without quantum repeaters, which have attracted significant attention. Generally, to ensure the security of these protocols, weak coherent states with continuous randomized phases are always assumed in the test mode. However, this assumption is difficult to meet in practice. To bridge the gap between theory and practice, we propose two alternative discrete-phase-randomized (DPR)-twin-field quantum key distribution protocols, which remove the phase sifting procedure in the code mode. Simulation results show that when compared with previous discrete-phase-randomized-twin-field quantum key distribution protocols, our modified protocols can significantly improve the secret key rate in the low channel loss range, which is very promising for practical twin-field quantum key distribution systems.

AB We design a variational quantum algorithm (VQA) to solve multi-dimensional Poisson equations with mixed boundary conditions that are typically required in various fields of computational science. Employing an objective function that is formulated with the concept of the minimal potential energy, we not only present in-depth discussion on the cost-efficient & noise-robust design of quantum circuits that are essential for evaluation of the objective function, but, more remarkably, employ the proposed algorithm to calculate bias-dependent spatial distributions of electric fields in semiconductor systems that are described with a two-dimensional domain and up to 10-qubit circuits. Extending the application scope to multi-dimensional problems with mixed boundary conditions for the first time, fairly solid computational results of this work clearly demonstrate the potential of VQAs to tackle Poisson equations derived from physically meaningful problems.

TI Characterizing entanglement using quantum discord over state extensions
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB We propose a framework to characterize entanglement with quantum discord, both asymmetric and symmetric, over state extensions. In particular, we show that the minimal Bures distance of discord over state extensions is equivalent to the Bures distance of entanglement. This equivalence places quantum discord in a more primitive position than entanglement conceptually in the sense that entanglement can be interpreted as an irreducible part of discord over all state extensions. Based on this equivalence, we also offer an operational meaning of the Bures distance of entanglement by connecting it to quantum state discrimination. Moreover, for the relative entropy part, we prove that the entanglement measure introduced by Devi and Rajagopal [A. R. U. Devi and A. K. Rajagopal, Phys. Rev. Lett. 100, 140502 (2008)] is actually equivalent to the relative entropy of entanglement. We also provide several quantifications of entanglement based on discord measures.

TI Analog quantum simulation of coupled electron-nuclear dynamics in
   molecules
SO CHEMICAL SCIENCE
AB Quantum computing has the potential to reduce the computational cost required for quantum dynamics simulations. However, existing quantum algorithms for coupled electron-nuclear dynamics simulation either require fault-tolerant devices, or involve the Born-Oppenheimer (BO) approximation and pre-calculation of electronic states on classical computers. We present the first quantum simulation approach for molecular vibronic dynamics in a pre-BO framework with an analog mapping of nuclear degrees of freedom, i.e. without the separation of electrons and nuclei, by mapping the molecular Hamiltonian to a device with coupled qubits and bosonic modes. We perform a proof-of-principle emulation of our ansatz using a single-mode model system which represents vibronic dynamics of chemical systems, such as nonadiabatic charge transfer involving polarization of the medium, and propose an implementation of our approach on a trapped-ion device. We show that our approach has exponential savings in resource and computational costs compared to the equivalent classical algorithms. Furthermore, our approach has a much smaller resource and implementation scaling than the existing pre-BO quantum algorithms for chemical dynamics. The low cost of our approach will enable an exact treatment of electron-nuclear dynamics on near-term quantum devices.

TI A Survey of Post-Quantum Cryptography Migration in Vehicles
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB The advent of quantum computers makes asymmetric cryptographic algorithms insecure and vulnerable. A promising solution to ensure the continued security attributes of confidentiality, integrity, and availability is the use of Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC) algorithms. The adoption of quantum-safe algorithms takes place at a vastly different pace in different industries. In some industries, adoption processes are slow due to the required adaptation of regulations and standards. At the same time, long-lived products with non-PQC algorithms are more likely to become insecure during their lifetime. Vehicles are a prime example of long-lived products where the adoption of PQC proceeds slowly. When quantum computers are able to break relevant key lengths of asymmetric cryptography and, thus, render current vehicle systems insecure, vehicles that are developed and produced today will most likely remain in use. In this work, we provide a structured and comprehensive overview of the current migration state of PQC algorithms in the automotive area. We address use cases involving asymmetric cryptography in the automotive context that face the challenge of adapting PQC, such as internal vehicle networks, manufacturer-specific communication, and vehicle-to-everything communication. In addition, we review the standards concerning vehicle security and their relevance to PQC. Finally, we identify and discuss open research challenges regarding the adoption of PQC in the automotive domain and further steps towards quantum-safe vehicles.

TI Quantum Algorithm for Petz Recovery Channels and Pretty Good
   Measurements
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB The Petz recovery channel plays an important role in quantum information science as an operation that approximately reverses the effect of a quantum channel. The pretty good measurement is a special case of the Petz recovery channel, and it allows for near-optimal state discrimination. A hurdle to the experimental realization of these vaunted theoretical tools is the lack of a systematic and efficient method to implement them. This Letter sets out to rectify this lack: Using the recently developed tools of quantum singular value transformation and oblivious amplitude amplification, we provide a quantum algorithm to implement the Petz recovery channel when given the ability to perform the channel that one wishes to reverse. Moreover, we prove that, in some sense, our quantum algorithm???s usage of the channel implementation cannot be improved by more than a quadratic factor. Our quantum algorithm also provides a procedure to perform pretty good measurements when given multiple copies of the states that one is trying to distinguish.

TI Conditions for Equivalent Noise Sensitivity of Geometric and Dynamical
   Quantum Gates
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB Geometric quantum gates are often expected to be more resilient than dynamical gates against certain types of error, which would make them ideal for robust quantum computing. However, this is still up for debate due to seemingly conflicting results in the literature. Here we use dynamical invariant theory in conjunction with filter functions in order to analytically characterize the noise sensitivity of an arbitrary quantum gate. For any control Hamiltonian that produces a geometric gate, we find that, under certain common conditions, one can construct another control Hamiltonian that produces an equivalent dynamical gate with identical noise sensitivity (as characterized by the filter function). Our result holds for a Hilbert space of arbitrary dimensions, but we illustrate our result by examining experimentally relevant singlequbit scenarios and providing explicit examples of equivalent geometric and dynamical gates.

TI A Flexible NTT-Based Multiplier for Post-Quantum Cryptography
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB In this work an NTT-based (Number Theoretic Transform) multiplier for code-based Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC) is presented, supporting Quasi Cyclic Low/Moderate-Density Parity-Check (QC LDPC/MDPC) codes. The cyclic matrix product, which is the fundamental operation required in this application, is treated as a polynomial product and adapted to the specific case of QC-MDPC codes proposed for Round 3 and 4 in the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) competition for PQC. The multiplier is a fundamental component in both encryption and decryption, and the proposed solution leads to a flexible NTT-based multiplier, which can efficiently handle all types of required products, where the vectors have a length asymptotic to 10(4) and can be moderately sparse. The proposed architecture is implemented using both Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) and Application Specific Integrated Circuit (ASIC) technologies and, when compared with the best published results, it features a 10 times reduction of the encryption times with the area increased by 3 times. The proposed multiplier, incorporated in the encryption and decryption stages of a code-based PQC cryptosystem, leads to an improvement over the best published results between 3 to 10 times in terms of $LC$ product (LUT times latency).

TI Quantum battery based on quantum discord at room temperature
SO QUANTUM SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB The study of advanced quantum devices for energy storage has attracted the attention of the scientific community in the past few years. Although several theoretical progresses have been achieved recently, experimental proposals of platforms operating as quantum batteries under ambient conditions are still lacking. In this context, this work presents a feasible realization of a quantum battery in a carboxylate-based metal complex, which can store a finite amount of extractable work under the form of quantum discord at room temperature, and recharge by thermalization with a reservoir. Moreover, the stored work can be evaluated through non-destructive measurements of the compound's magnetic susceptibility. These results pave the way for the development of enhanced energy storage platforms through material engineering.

TI Emulating Quantum Circuits With Generalized Ising Machines
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB The primary objective of this paper is to present an exact and general procedure for mapping any sequence of quantum gates onto a network of probabilistic p-bits which can take on one of two values 0 and 1. The first n p-bits represent the input qubits, while the other p-bits represent the qubits after the application of successive gating operations. We can view this structure as a Boltzmann machine whose states each represent a Feynman path leading from an initial configuration of qubits to a final configuration. Each such path has a complex amplitude Psi which can be associated with a complex energy. The real part of this energy can be used to generate samples of Feynman paths in the usual way, while the imaginary part is accounted for by treating the samples as complex entities, unlike ordinary Boltzmann machines where samples are positive. Quantum gates often have purely imaginary energy functions for which all configurations have the same probability and one cannot take advantage of sampling techniques. Typically this would require us to collect 2nd samples which would severely limit its utility. However, if we can use suitable transformations to introduce a real part in the energy function then powerful sampling algorithms like Gibbs sampling can be harnessed to get acceptable results with far fewer samples and perhaps even escape the exponential scaling with nd . This algorithmic acceleration can then be supplemented with special-purpose hardware accelerators like Ising Machines which can obtain a very large number of samples per second through a combination of massive parallelism, pipelining, and clockless mixed-signal operation made possible by codesigning circuits and architectures to match the algorithm. Our results for mapping an arbitrary quantum circuit to a Boltzmann machine with a complex energy function should help push the boundaries of the simulability of quantum circuits with probabilistic resources and compare them with NISQ-era quantum computers.

TI Securing IoT devices: A novel approach using blockchain and quantum
   cryptography
SO INTERNET OF THINGS
AB This paper delves into the crucial challenge of safeguarding data sensitivity and preventing security breaches, which can result in substantial losses, including significant financial costs and potential loss of lives. Notably, the United States faces the highest financial burden, with data breaches costing approximately USD 5.09 million. With the proliferation of Internet of Things (IoT) devices, enormous volumes of data are collected from diverse sources. However, the inherent limitations in computational power and memory of IoT devices render them susceptible targets for malicious attacks. This study focuses on fortifying the security of multimedia data, encompassing audio, video, and images, obtained from IoT devices. Cutting-edge technologies such as blockchain and quantum cryptography are explored as promising avenues to bolster multimedia security and preserve privacy. Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) emerges as an alternative to classical encryption and key distribution methods, offering heightened data security. Simultaneously, blockchain leverages hash functions to augment the overall security posture. By harnessing the principles of quantum mechanics, QKD facilitates secure key exchange between involved parties for data encryption and decryption. Additionally, the paper introduces innovative methodologies to enhance the security, privacy, and anonymity of IoT devices.

TI Quantum matching pursuit: A quantum algorithm for sparse representations
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Representing signals with sparse vectors has a wide spectrum of applications that ranges from image and video coding to shape representation and health monitoring. In many applications with real-time requirements or that deal with high-dimensional signals, the computational complexity of the encoder that finds the sparse representation plays an important role. Quantum computing has recently shown promising speedups in many representation learning tasks. In this work, we propose a quantum version of the well-known matching-pursuit algorithm. Assuming the availability of a fault-tolerant quantum random access memory, our quantum matching pursuit lowers the complexity of its classical counterpart by a polynomial factor, at the cost of some error in the computation of the inner products, enabling the computation of sparse representations of high-dimensional signals. Besides proving the computational complexity of our algorithm, we provide numerical experiments that show that its error is negligible in practice. This work opens the path to further research on quantum algorithms for finding sparse representations, showing suitable quantum computing applications in signal processing.

TI Strong coherent ion-electron coupling using a wire data bus
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW APPLIED
AB Ion-ion coupling over long distances represents a highly useful resource for quantum technologies, for example, to sympathetically cool or interconnect qubits in ion-based quantum computing architectures. In this respect, the recently demonstrated wire-mediated ion-ion coupling stands due to the simplification of its trap layout and its prospects for deterministic entanglement. However, the strength of such coherent ion-wire-ion coupling is typically weak, hindering its practical utilization. Here, we propose a wire-mediated scheme for coherent ion-electron coupling. The scheme not only enables the sympathetic cooling of electrons via advanced ion-cooling techniques, but also allows promotion of the effective ionion coupling strength by orders of magnitudes via electron mediation. Our work thus paves a way toward quantum information processing in ion-electron hybrid quantum systems.

TI Fast joint parity measurement via collective interactions induced by
   stimulated emission
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Parity detection is essential in quantum error correction. Error syndromes coded in parity are detected routinely by sequential CNOT gates. Here, different from the standard CNOT-gate based scheme, we propose a reliable joint parity measurement (JPM) scheme inspired by stimulated emission. By controlling the collective behavior between data qubits and syndrome qubit, we realize the parity detection and experimentally implement the weight-2 and weight-4 JPM scheme in a tunable coupling superconducting circuit, which shows comparable performance to the CNOT scheme. Moreover, with the aid of the coupling tunability in quantum system, this scheme can be further utilized for specific joint entangling state preparation (JEP) with high fidelity, such as multiqubit entangled state preparation for non-adjacent qubits. This strategy, combined with the superconducting qubit system with tunable couplers, reveals tremendous potential and applications in the surface code architecture without adding extra circuit elements. Besides, the method we develop here can readily be applied in large-scale quantum computation and quantum simulation.

TI Single-Photon Detectors for Quantum Integrated Photonics
SO PHOTONICS
AB Single-photon detectors have gained significant attention recently, driven by advancements in quantum information technology. Applications such as quantum key distribution, quantum cryptography, and quantum computation demand the ability to detect individual quanta of light and distinguish between single-photon states and multi-photon states, particularly when operating within waveguide systems. Although single-photon detector fabrication has been established for some time, integrating detectors with waveguides using new materials with suitable structural and electronic properties, especially at telecommunication wavelengths, creates more compact source-line-detector systems. This review explores the state of the art of single-photon detector research and examines the potential breakthroughs offered by novel low-dimensional materials in this field.

TI Private Computation of Phylogenetic Trees Based on Quantum Technologies
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB Individuals' privacy and legal regulations demand genomic data be handled and studied with highly secure privacy-preserving techniques. In this work, we propose a feasible Secure Multiparty Computation (SMC) system assisted with quantum cryptographic protocols that is designed to compute a phylogenetic tree from a set of private genome sequences. This system significantly improves the privacy and security of the computation thanks to three quantum cryptographic protocols that provide enhanced security against quantum computer attacks. This system adapts several distance-based methods (Unweighted Pair Group Method with Arithmetic mean, Neighbour-Joining, Fitch-Margoliash) into a private setting where the sequences owned by each party are not disclosed to the other members present in the protocol. We theoretically evaluate the performance and privacy guarantees of the system through a complexity analysis and security proof and give an extensive explanation about the implementation details and cryptographic protocols. We also implement a quantum-assisted secure phylogenetic tree computation based on the Libscapi implementation of the Yao, the PHYLIP library and simulated keys of two quantum systems: Quantum Oblivious Key Distribution and Quantum Key Distribution. This demonstrates its effectiveness and practicality. We benchmark this implementation against a classical-only solution and we conclude that both approaches render similar execution times, the only difference being the time overhead taken by the oblivious key management system of the quantum-assisted approach.

TI Training a Quantum Annealing Based Restricted Boltzmann Machine on
   Cybersecurity Data
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON EMERGING TOPICS IN COMPUTATIONAL INTELLIGENCE
AB A restricted Boltzmann machine (RBM) is a generative model that could be used in effectively balancing a cybersecurity dataset because the synthetic data a RBM generates follows the probability distribution of the training data. RBM training can be performed using contrastive divergence (CD) and quantum annealing (QA). QA-based RBM training is fundamentally different from CD and requires samples from a quantum computer. We present a real-world application that uses a quantum computer. Specifically, we train a RBM using QA for cybersecurity applications. The D-Wave 2000Q has been used to implement QA. RBMs are trained on the ISCX data, which is a benchmark dataset for cybersecurity. For comparison, RBMs are also trained using CD. CD is a commonly used method for RBM training. Our analysis of the ISCX data shows that the dataset is imbalanced. We present two different schemes to balance the training dataset before feeding it to a classifier. The first scheme is based on the undersampling of benign instances. The imbalanced training dataset is divided into five sub-datasets that are trained separately. A majority voting is then performed to get the result. Our results show the majority vote increases the classification accuracy up from 90.24% to 95.68%, in the case of CD. For the case of QA, the classification accuracy increases from 74.14% to 80.04%. In the second scheme, a RBM is used to generate synthetic data to balance the training dataset. We show that both QA and CD-trained RBM can be used to generate useful synthetic data. Balanced training data is used to evaluate several classifiers. Among the classifiers investigated, K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) and Neural Network (NN) perform better than other classifiers. They both show an accuracy of 93%. Our results show a proof-of-concept that a QA-based RBM can be trained on a 64-bit binary dataset. The illustrative example suggests the possibility to migrate many practical classification problems to QA-based techniques. Further, we show that synthetic data generated from a RBM can be used to balance the original dataset.

TI Quantum sensing of ultralow temperature in biwire ultracold polar
   molecules
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB We present a systematic study of quantum sensing of ultralow temperature in biwire ultracold polar molecules of a quasi-one-dimensional (1D) trap by exploring the dynamics of two physically different qubit models. The two models consist of a trapped impurity atom that act as a temperature quantum sensor interacting with polar molecules reservoir, where dipole moments are aligned head-to-tail across the wires. Our model takes advantage of the adjustable interwire distance to accurately control the precision ultralow temperatures measurement. We show that the system undergoes a transition from Markovian to non-Markovian dynamics, which can be controlled by changing the interwire separation, the dipole-dipole interaction (DDI), and the temperature. We characterize the thermometric performance using the quantum signal-to-noise ratio for both models and demonstrate that such a quantity exhibits a higher peak at ultralow temperature. We therefore emphasize that ultracold polar molecules are crucial for revolutionizing temperature sensing.

TI Enabling Pulse-Level Programming, Compilation, and Execution in XACC
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON COMPUTERS
AB Noisy gate-model quantum processing units (QPUs) are currently available from vendors over the cloud, and digital quantum programming approaches exist to run low-depth circuits on physical hardware. These digital representations are ultimately lowered to pulse-level instructions by vendor quantum control systems to affect unitary evolution representative of the submitted digital circuit. Vendors are beginning to open this pulse-level control system to the public via specified interfaces. Robust programming methodologies, software frameworks, and backend simulation technologies for this analog model of quantum computation will prove critical to advancing pulse-level control research and development. Prototypical use cases for this include error mitigation, optimal pulse control, and physics-inspired pulse construction. Here we present an extension to the XACC quantum-classical software framework that enables pulse-level programming for superconducting, gate-model quantum computers, and a novel, general, and extensible pulse-level simulation backend for XACC that scales on classical compute clusters via MPI. Our work enables custom backend Hamiltonian definitions and gate-level compilation to available pulses with a focus on performance and scalability. We end with a demonstration of this capability, and show how to use XACC for pertinent pulse-level programming tasks.

TI Pairwise quantum correlations in four-level quantum dot systems
SO PHYSICS LETTERS A
AB In this paper we assume quantum dots can be assimilated to Fermi Hubbard sites when the Coulomb interaction between electrons is higher compared to their tunneling. The study of pairwise entanglement in a small size array of quantum dots allows to model each pair as a quadrit-quadrit system (4 x 4 mixed state) instead of the more common and simplistic approach of describing it in quantum information as a qubit-qubit system. We study the effect of Coulomb interaction and temperature on pairwise entanglement as well as on quantum coherence and total correlations. The crucial results of this study are that entanglement resists better the increase in temperature when the Coulomb interaction is stronger. Moreover, we successfully explain the behavior of these correlations in terms of the energy spectrum, namely the ground state degeneracy and the state energy difference. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V.

TI Accuracy vs memory advantage in the quantum simulation of stochastic
   processes
SO MACHINE LEARNING-SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB Many inference scenarios rely on extracting relevant information from known data in order to make future predictions. When the underlying stochastic process satisfies certain assumptions, there is a direct mapping between its exact classical and quantum simulators, with the latter asymptotically using less memory. Here we focus on studying whether such quantum advantage persists when those assumptions are not satisfied, and the model is doomed to have imperfect accuracy. By studying the trade-off between accuracy and memory requirements, we show that quantum models can reach the same accuracy with less memory, or alternatively, better accuracy with the same memory. Finally, we discuss the implications of this result for learning tasks.

TI i-QER: An Intelligent Approach TowardsQuantum Error Reduction
SO ACM TRANSACTIONS ON QUANTUM COMPUTING
AB Quantum computing has become a promising computing approach because of its capability to solve certain problems, exponentially faster than classical computers. A n-qubit quantum system is capable of providing 2n computational space to a quantum algorithm. However, quantum computers are prone to errors. Quantum circuits that can reliably run on today's Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) devices are not only limited by their qubit counts but also by their noisy gate operations. In this article, we have introduced i-QER, a scalable machine learning-based approach to evaluate errors in a quantum circuit and reduce these without using any additional quantum resources. The i-QER predicts possible errors in a given quantum circuit using supervised learning models. If the predicted error is above a pre-specified threshold, it cuts the large quantum circuit into two smaller sub-circuits using an error-influenced fragmentation strategy for the first time to the best of our knowledge. The proposed fragmentation process is iterated until the predicted error reaches below the threshold for each sub-circuit. The sub-circuits are then executed on a quantum device. Classical reconstruction of the outputs obtained from the sub-circuits can generate the output of the complete circuit. Thus, i-QER also provides classical control over a scalable hybrid computing approach, which is a combination of quantum and classical computers. The i-QER tool is available at https://github.com/SaikatBasu90/i-QER.

TI Exact and Practical Pattern Matching for Quantum Circuit Optimization
SO ACM TRANSACTIONS ON QUANTUM COMPUTING
AB Quantum computations are typically performed as a sequence of basic operations, called quantum gates. Different gate sequences, called quantum circuits, can implement the same overall quantum computation. Since every additional quantum gate takes time and introduces noise into the system, it is important to find the smallest possible quantum circuit that implements a given computation, especially for near-term quantum devices that can execute only a limited number of quantum gates before noise renders the computation useless. An important building block for many quantum circuit optimization techniques is pattern matching: given a large and small quantum circuit, we would like to find all maximal matches of the small circuit, called a pattern, in the large circuit, considering pairwise commutation of quantum gates. In this work, we present the first classical algorithm for pattern matching that provably finds all maximal matches and is efficient enough to be practical for circuit sizes typical for near-term devices. We demonstrate numerically1 that combining our algorithm with known pattern-matching-based circuit optimization techniques reduces the gate count of a random quantum circuit by similar to 30% and can further improve practically relevant quantum circuits that were already optimized with state-of-the-art techniques.

TI Photon-Interfaced Ten-Qubit Register of Trapped Ions
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB Establishing networks of quantum processors offers a path to scalable quantum computing and applications in communication and sensing. This requires first developing efficient interfaces between photons and multiqubit registers. In this Letter, we show how to entangle each individual matter qubit in a register of ten to a separate traveling photon. The qubits are encoded in a string of cotrapped atomic ions. By switching the trap confinement, ions are brought one at a time into the waist of an optical cavity and emit a photon via a laser-driven cavity-mediated Raman transition. The result is a train of photonic qubits, each near-maximally entangled by their polarization with a different ion qubit in the string. An average ion-photon Bell state fidelity of 92% is achieved, for an average probability for detecting each single photon of 9%. The technique is directly scalable to larger ion-qubit registers and opens up the near-term possibility of entangling distributed networks of trapped-ion quantum processors, sensing arrays, and clocks.

TI Distributed Quantum Algorithm for the NISQ Era: A Novel Approach to
   Solving Simon's Problem with Reduced Resources
SO ADVANCED QUANTUM TECHNOLOGIES
AB Distributed quantum computation has gained significant interest in the noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) era. This paradigm requires each computing node to possess a reduced number of qubits and quantum gates. In this study, a Distributed Simon's Algorithm (DSA) is designed to tackle Simon's problem, which entails the discovery of a hidden string s is an element of {0, 1}n of a promised Boolean function f : {0, 1}n -> {0, 1}m, where f (x) = f (y) if and only if x = y or x circle plus y = s. Specifically, 1) our algorithm is capable of being partitioned into any t nodes, where 2 <= t <= n; 2) the number of queries required by the DSA is n - t, while that of the original Simon's algorithm (SA) is n - 1; 3) the maximum number of qubits required by our approach at a single node is max ( n0, n1, ... , nt-1 ) + m, which is fewer than the qubits required by both the SA and existing distributed Simon's algorithm. Here, nj denotes the number of computing qubits needed for the j-th node and satisfies & sum;t-1 j=0 nj = n; 4) the optimal circuit depth of the DSA is (m + 1) . 2 n t + 2, which is reduced compared to the circuit depth of the SA, (m + 1) . 2n + 2; 5) in contrast to currently distributed schemes, the DSA eliminates the need for classical queries; 6) how the DSA solves a specific Simon's problem (e.g., s = 1000) is also simulated using MindSpore Quantum, a quantum simulation software. The simulation results show that the DSA features a shallower quantum circuit, thereby demonstrating enhanced resistance to circuit noise. This characteristic makes it more feasible for implementation in the NISQ era.

AB After decades of being mainly confined to theoretical research, Quantum Computing is now becoming a useful tool for solving realistic problems. This work aims to experimentally explore the feasibility of using currently available quantum computers, based on the Quantum Annealing paradigm, to build a recommender system exploiting community detection. Community detection, by partitioning users and items into densely connected clusters, can boost the accuracy of non-personalized recommendation by assuming that users within each community share similar tastes. However, community detection is a computationally expensive process. The recent availability of Quantum Annealers as cloud-based devices, constitutes a new and promising direction to explore community detection, although effectively leveraging this new technology is a long-term path that still requires advancements in both hardware and algorithms. This work aims to begin this path by assessing the quality of community detection formulated as a Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization problem on a real recommendation scenario. Results on several datasets show that the quantum solver is able to detect communities of comparable quality with respect to classical solvers, but with better speedup, and the non-personalized recommendation models built on top of these communities exhibit improved recommendation quality. The takeaway is that quantum computing, although in its early stages of maturity and applicability, shows promise in its ability to support new recommendation models and to bring improved scalability as technology evolves.

TI Highly photon-loss-tolerant quantum computing using hybrid qubits
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB We investigate a scheme for topological quantum computing using optical hybrid qubits and make an extensive comparison with previous all-optical schemes. We show that the photon loss threshold reported by Omkar et al. [Phys. Rev. Lett. 125, 060501 (2020)] can be improved further by employing postselection and multi-Bell-state-measurement-based entangling operations to create a special cluster state, known as Raussendorf lattice for topological quantum computation. In particular, the photon loss threshold is enhanced up to 5.7 x 10(-3), which is the highest reported value given a reasonable error model. This improvement is obtained at the price of consuming more resources by an order of magnitude compared with the scheme in the aforementioned reference. Nevertheless, this scheme remains resource-efficient compared with other known optical schemes for fault-tolerant quantum computation.

TI Sequential quantum simulation of spin chains with a single circuit QED
   device
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Quantum simulations of many-body systems in materials science and chemistry are promising application areas for quantum computers. However, the limited scale and coherence of near-term quantum processors pose a significant obstacle to realizing this potential. Here, we theoretically outline how a single-mode circuit quantum electrodynamics device, consisting of a transmon qubit coupled to a long-lived cavity mode, can be used to simulate the ground state of a highly entangled quantum many-body spin chain. We exploit recently developed methods for implementing quantum operations to sequentially build up a matrix product state (MPS) representation of a many-body state. This approach reuses the transmon qubit to read out the state of each spin in the chain and exploits the large state space of the cavity as a quantum memory encoding intersite correlations and entanglement. We show, through simulation, that analog (pulse-level) control schemes can accurately prepare a known MPS representation of a quantum critical spin chain in significantly less time than digital (gate-based) methods, thereby reducing the exposure to decoherence. We then explore this analog-control approach for the variational preparation of an unknown ground state. We demonstrate that the large state space of the cavity can be used to replace multiple qubits in a qubit-only architecture, and could therefore simplify the design of quantum processors for materials simulation. We explore the practical limitations of realistic noise and decoherence and discuss avenues for scaling this approach to more complex problems that challenge classical computational methods.

TI Effect of quantum error correction on detection-induced coherent errors
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB We study the performance of quantum error correction codes (QECCs) under the detection-induced coherent error due to the imperfectness of practical implementations of stabilizer measurements, after running a quantum circuit. Considering the most promising surface code, we find that the detection-induced coherent error will result in undetected error terms, which will accumulate and evolve into logical errors. However, we show that such errors will be alleviated by increasing the code size, akin to eliminating other types of errors discussed previously. We also find that with detection-induced coherent errors, the exact surface code becomes an approximate QECC.

TI Coherent spin qubit shuttling through germanium quantum dots
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Quantum links can interconnect qubit registers and are therefore essential in networked quantum computing. Semiconductor quantum dot qubits have seen significant progress in the high-fidelity operation of small qubit registers but establishing a compelling quantum link remains a challenge. Here, we show that a spin qubit can be shuttled through multiple quantum dots while preserving its quantum information. Remarkably, we achieve these results using hole spin qubits in germanium, despite the presence of strong spin-orbit interaction. In a minimal quantum dot chain, we accomplish the shuttling of spin basis states over effective lengths beyond 300 microns and demonstrate the coherent shuttling of superposition states over effective lengths corresponding to 9 microns, which we can extend to 49 microns by incorporating dynamical decoupling. These findings indicate qubit shuttling as an effective approach to route qubits within registers and to establish quantum links between registers.
   Spin shuttling is a promising technique for establishing a quantum link between qubit registers and has been studied in several quantum dot qubit platforms. Here the authors realize coherent shuttling of a hole spin qubit in a minimal quantum dot chain in germanium despite strong spin-orbit coupling.

TI Optical transmission of microwave control signal towards large-scale
   superconducting quantum computing
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB With the rapid development of superconducting quantum computing and the implementation of surface code, large-scale quantum computing is emerging as an urgent demand. In a superconducting computing system, the qubit is maintained in a cryogenic environment to avoid thermal excitation. Thus, the transmission of control signals, which are generated at room temperature, is needed. Typically, the transmission of these signals to the qubit relies on a coaxial cable wiring approach. However, in a large-scale computing system with hundreds or even thousands of qubits, the coaxial cables will pose great space and heat load to the dilution refrigerator. Here, to tackle this problem, we propose and demonstrate a direct-modulation-based optical transmission line. In our experiment, the average single-qubit XEB error and control error are measured as 0.139% and 0.014% separately, demonstrating the feasibility of the optical wiring approach and paving the way for large-scale superconducting quantum computing.

TI Cluster dynamics of knowledge on efficiency of and demand for Russian
   studies in quantum technologies
SO NAUCHNYE I TEKHNICHESKIE BIBLIOTEKI-SCIENTIFIC AND TECHNICAL LIBRARIES
AB The author evaluates the effectiveness of Russian research studies in quantum technologies (including use of quantum computers, quantum cryptography, quantum communications) in 2011-2020. The analysis is based on the Russian Science Citation Index and scientometric indicators: researcher publication activity - yearly number of publications of research findings, citations and penetration of these publications.
   The author found that almost till the end of the reviewed decade the number of publications and citation had been constantly increasing which evidenced on the increasing interest of Russian researches toward this area not prevented even by the 2014 crisis: at the end of the period, the number of publications outstripped the minimum of 2011 four times, and in 2013, it exceeded the citation maximum two times. The author points to the fact that the highest publication activity and citation of Russian researchers was in the area of quantum computers, and the lowest - in quantum communications; the highest demand was demonstrated in 2012 in quantum communications. The maximum penetration in the area of quantum computers of 2017 is approx. by half and twice tower than the similar indicator in quantum cryptography in 2011 and quantum communications.
   The relatively low indicators of penetration of research products in 2020 via all vectors are obviously of the same nature as the low citation indexes in 2020: the delayed response of scientific community to current year publications. The highly demanded vectors of studies in various areas of quantum technologies are determined. The illustrations are provided.

TI Coherent Control of a Few-Channel Hole Type Gatemon Qubit
SO NANO LETTERS
AB Gatemon qubits are the electrically tunable cousins of superconducting transmon qubits. In this work, we demonstrate the full coherent control of a gatemon qubit based on hole carriers in a Ge/Si core/shell nanowire, with the longest coherence times in group IV material gatemons to date. The key to these results is a high-quality Josephson junction obtained using a straightforward and reproducible annealing technique. We demonstrate that the transport through the narrow junction is dominated by only two quantum channels, with transparencies up to unity. This novel qubit platform holds great promise for quantum information applications, not only because it incorporates technologically relevant materials, but also because it provides new opportunities, like an ultrastrong spin-orbit coupling in the few-channel regime of Josephson junctions.

TI Digital-Analog Quantum Simulation of Fermionic Models
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW APPLIED
AB Simulating quantum many-body systems is a highly demanding task since the required resources grow exponentially with the dimension of the system. In the case of fermionic systems, this is even harder since nonlocal interactions emerge due to the antisymmetric character of the fermionic wave function. Here, we introduce a digital-analog quantum algorithm to simulate a wide class of fermionic Hamiltonians including the paradigmatic one-dimensional Fermi-Hubbard model. These digital-analog methods allow quantum algorithms to run beyond digital versions via an efficient use of coherence time. Furthermore, we exemplify our techniques with a low-connected architecture for realistic digital-analog implementations of specific fermionic models.

AB Two stoichiometric metal-organic frameworks containing Eu3+ cations are probed as candidates for photon -based quantum information storage. Synthesis procedures for growing 0.2 mm, rod-shaped Eu(HCOO)(3) and 1-3 mm, rhombohedral Eu(HCOO)(3).(HCONH2)(2) single crystals are presented with visible precipitation as soon as 1 h into heating for Eu(HCOO)(3) and 24 h for Eu(HCOO)(3).(HCONH2)(2). Room temperature and 1.4 K photo-luminescence measurements of the D-5(0)-> 7FJ transitions of Eu3+ are analyzed for both compounds. Comparisons of peak width and intensity are discussed along with the notable first report for both of the D-5(0)-> 7F0 transition, the hyperfine structure of which has potential use in quantum memory applications. The air instability of Eu(HCOO)(3).(HCONH2)(2) and the transformation of its photoluminescence properties are discussed.

TI Quantum key distribution with a borosilicate-glass-matrix integrated
   photonic receiver
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Photonic integrated circuits (PICs) are key to advancing quantum technologies for secure communications. They offer inherent stability, low losses, and compactness compared to standard fiber-based and free-space systems. Our research demonstrates PICs' effectiveness in enhancing quantum communications; we implement a three-state BB84 protocol with a decoy-state method, and we employ an integrated receiver and superconducting nanowire single-photon detectors to achieve technological advancements. One of the most notable results is the extraction of a secret key over a 45 dB channel attenuation. This achievement in the maximum covered distance signifies the potential of integrated photonics to advance the field of quantum communication.

TI Qubit Mapping Based on Subgraph Isomorphism and Filtered Depth-Limited
   Search
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON COMPUTERS
AB Mapping logical quantum circuits to Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) devices is a challenging problem which has attracted rapidly increasing interests from both quantum and classical computing communities. This article proposes an efficient method by (i) selecting an initial mapping that takes into consideration the similarity between the architecture graph of the given NISQ device and a graph induced by the input logical circuit and (ii) searching, in a filtered and depth-limited way, a most useful swap combination that makes executable as many as possible two-qubit gates in the logical circuit. The proposed circuit transformation algorithm can significantly decrease the number of auxiliary two-qubit gates required to be added to the logical circuit, especially when it has a large number of two-qubit gates. For an extensive benchmark set of 131 circuits and IBM's current premium Q system, viz., IBM Q Tokyo, our algorithm needs, in average, 0.3801 extra two-qubit gates per input two-qubit gate, while the corresponding figures for three state-of-the-art algorithms are 0.4705, 0.8154, and 1.0066, respectively.

TI Generalized Knill-Laflamme theorem for families of isoclinic subspaces
SO CANADIAN MATHEMATICAL BULLETIN-BULLETIN CANADIEN DE MATHEMATIQUES
AB Isoclinic subspaces have been studied for over a century. Quantum error correcting codes were recently shown to define a subclass of families of isoclinic subspaces. The Knill-Laflamme theorem is a seminal result in the theory of quantum error correction, a central topic in quantum information. We show there is a generalized version of the Knill-Laflamme result and conditions that applies to all families of isoclinic subspaces. In the case of quantum stabilizer codes, the expanded conditions are shown to capture logical operators. We apply the general conditions to give a new perspective on a classical subclass of isoclinic subspaces defined by the graphs of anti-commuting unitary operators. We show how the result applies to recently studied mutually unbiased quantum measurements (MUMs), and we give a new construction of such measurements motivated by the approach.

TI Quantum computing and chemistry
SO CELL REPORTS PHYSICAL SCIENCE
AB As the year-to-year gains in speeds of classical computers continue to taper off, computational chemists are increasingly examining quantum computing as a possible route to achieve greater computational performance. Quantum computers, built upon the properties of superposition, interference, and entanglement of quantum bits, offer, in principle, the possibility to outperform classical computers for solving many important classes of problems. In the field of chemistry, quantum algorithm development offers promising propositions for solving classically intractable problems in areas such as electronic structure, chemical quantum dynamics, spectroscopy, and cheminformatics. However, physical implementations of quantum computers are still in their infancy and have yet to outperform classical computers for useful computations. Still, quantum software development for chemistry is a highly active area of research. In this perspective, we summarize recent progress in the areas of quantum computing algorithms, hardware, and software, and we describe the challenges that remain for useful implementations of quantum computing for chemical applications.

TI Finite key effects in satellite quantum key distribution
SO NPJ QUANTUM INFORMATION
AB Global quantum communications will enable long-distance secure data transfer, networked distributed quantum information processing, and other entanglement-enabled technologies. Satellite quantum communication overcomes optical fibre range limitations, with the first realisations of satellite quantum key distribution (SatQKD) being rapidly developed. However, limited transmission times between satellite and ground station severely constrains the amount of secret key due to finite-block size effects. Here, we analyse these effects and the implications for system design and operation, utilising published results from the Micius satellite to construct an empirically-derived channel and system model for a trusted-node downlink employing efficient Bennett-Brassard 1984 (BB84) weak coherent pulse decoy states with optimised parameters. We quantify practical SatQKD performance limits and examine the effects of link efficiency, background light, source quality, and overpass geometries to estimate long-term key generation capacity. Our results may guide design and analysis of future missions, and establish performance benchmarks for both sources and detectors.

TI Short quantum circuits in reinforcement learning policies for the
   vehicle routing problem
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Quantum computing and machine learning have potential for symbiosis. However, in addition to the hardware limitations from current devices, there are still basic issues that must be addressed before quantum circuits can usefully incorporate with current machine learning tasks. We report a strategy for such an integration in the context of attention models used for reinforcement learning. Agents that implement attention mechanisms have successfully been applied to certain cases of combinatorial routing problems by first encoding nodes on a graph and then sequentially decoding nodes until a route is selected. We demonstrate that simple quantum circuits can be used in place of classical attention head layers while maintaining performance. Our method modifies attention mechanisms by replacing key and query vectors for every node with quantum states that are entangled before being measured. The resulting hybrid classical-quantum agent is tested in the context of vehicle routing problems where its performance is competitive with the original classical approach. We regard our model as a prototype that can be scaled up and as an avenue for further study on the role of quantum computing in reinforcement learning.

TI Qubit Reduction and Quantum Speedup for Wireless Channel Assignment
   Problem
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON QUANTUM ENGINEERING
AB In this article, we propose a novel method of formulating an NP-hard wireless channel assignment problem as a higher-order unconstrained binary optimization (HUBO), where the Grover adaptive search (GAS) is used to provide a quadratic speedup for solving the problem. The conventional method relies on a one-hot encoding of the channel indices, resulting in a quadratic formulation. By contrast, we conceive ascending and descending binary encodings of the channel indices, construct a specific quantum circuit, and derive the exact numbers of qubits and gates required by GAS. Our analysis clarifies that the proposed HUBO formulation significantly reduces the number of qubits and the query complexity compared with the conventional quadratic formulation. This advantage is achieved at the cost of an increased number of quantum gates, which we demonstrate can be reduced by our proposed descending binary encoding.

AB Computational offloading involves the transfer of computational tasks to a separate device. We apply this concept to quantum computing, whereby particular algorithms (i.e. "quantum algorithms") are automatically recognized and executed on a quantum computer. We propose a method that utilizes program equivalence checking to discern between code suited for execution on a conventional computer and a quantum computer. This process involves comparing a quantum algorithm's implementation with code written by a programmer, with semantic equivalence between the two implying that the programmer's code should be executed on a quantum computer instead of a conventional computer. Using a novel compiler optimization verification tool named CORK, we test for semantic equivalence between a portion of Shor's algorithm (the "prototype") and various modified versions of this code (representing the arbitrary code written by a programmer). Some of the modified versions are intended to be semantically equivalent to the prototype while others semantically inequivalent. Our approach is able to correctly determine semantic equivalence or semantic inequivalence in a majority of cases.

TI Multi-LFSR Architectures for BRLWE-Based Post Quantum Cryptography
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB The advancement in quantum computing has led to a significant progress in the development of public-key cryptosystems, referred as Post Quantum Cryptography (PQC) which has robust security to withstand both classical and quantum attacks. Lattice-based cryptography, one of the most promising PQC candidate offers low complexity and has strong security proof relying on the hardness of Learning-with-errors (LWE) problem. A variant of LWE, Ring-learning-with-error (RLWE) performs arithmetic operations over a polynomial ring and has more efficient implementations compared to LWE. Recent works propose Binary-ring-learning-with-error (BRLWE), a new variant of RLWE which has less key size and more efficient implementations compared to both LWE and RLWE-based schemes. In this paper, an algorithm is developed for BRLWE-based scheme based on decomposing the arithmetic operation $H.L\; mod (x<^>{n}+1) + M$ into desired number of segments. The arithmetic operation includes polynomial multiplication and addition over the ring $x<^>{n}+1$ where H and M are two integer polynomials and L is a binary polynomial. We illustrate two efficient hardware architectures Dual-LFSR (DL) and Quad-LFSR (QL) to enable parallel execution of individual segments employing LFSR structures to have a significant reduction in latency compared to the existing works. Despite of having larger area, the reduction in latency leads to an improvement in other performance metrics such as delay, Area-Delay Product (ADP), Power-Delay Product (PDP), throughput and efficiency making the proposed structures well suitable for PQC schemes. Experimental results show that the proposed architectures when compared with the recently reported work has 23% and 25% ADP improvement with DL and QL structures respectively when n = 256.

The task is to write a short essay by each student on the hypothetical addition of a narrowly applicable QIT layer to the actual implementation of the thesis, if possible. In most cases, this is possible because QITs cover a very wide range of potential technical applications. Where this is not possible, or in the case of an undefined thesis topic, students should write a more general essay or write their personal opinion on what they think about the future of QIT. The current article is another part of a series of works on this topic with subsequent student groups.

AB An innovative solution for predictive maintenance in IIoT systems combining quantum computing with the proficiency of LSTM neural networks is proposed by us. Our concept is guided by a hybrid quantum-classical architecture to facilitate quantum computing to exploit highdimensional industrial sensor measurements while preserving crucial temporal relationships through particular quantum channels. Through the combination of the representational ingenuity of quantum circuits, along with the sequence-based modelling of classical LSTMs, QE-LSTM is uniquely positioned to handle complicated time series coming out of industrial sensors. At the heart of our methodology are the following unique elements: center dot A collaborative framework integrating quantum and classical technologies allowing for the quantum computer to manage the complex analysis of high dimensional sensor data in the industry. center dot Quantum channel designs were aimed at minimizing temporal dependencies in temporal series industrial measurements, thereby maximizing the quality of sequential analysis. center dot Under ODS hindcasting, QE-LSTM improved F1 by 4-5 percentage points on SECOM and reduced RMSE and NASA Score on C-MAPSS; trends were consistent on IMMD (Tables 1-2). In the application of failure detection of bearing, QE-LSTM improves F1 over classical baselines on SECOM by 4-5 pp, with similar gains on IMMD; results on C-MAPSS (RUL) show consistent reductions in RMSE and NASA score.

TI Bonsai Algorithm: Grow Your Own Fermion-to-Qubit Mappings
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB Fermion-to-qubit mappings are used to represent fermionic modes on quantum computers, an essential first step in many quantum algorithms for electronic structure calculations. In this work, we present a formalism to design flexible fermion-to-qubit mappings from ternary trees. We intuitively discuss the connection between the structure of the generating trees and certain properties of the resulting mapping, such as the Pauli weight and the delocalization of mode occupation. Moreover, we introduce a recipe that guarantees that Fock basis states are mapped to computational basis states in qubit space, a desirable property for many applications in quantum computing. Based on this formalism, we introduce the Bonsai algorithm, which takes as input the potentially limited topology of the qubit connectivity of a quantum device and returns a tailored fermion-to-qubit mapping that reduces the SWAP overhead compared to other paradigmatic mappings. We illustrate the algorithm by producing mappings for the heavy-hexagon topology widely used in IBM quantum computers. The resulting mappings have a favorable Pauli-weight scaling O(& RADIC;N) on this connectivity while ensuring that no SWAP gates are necessary for single-excitation operations.

TI Episodic Memory: Mental Time Travel or a Quantum "Memory Wave" Function?
SO PSYCHOLOGICAL REVIEW
AB Where do we "go" when we recollect our past? When remembering a past event, it is intuitive to imagine some part of ourselves mentally "jumping back in time" to when the event occurred. I propose an alternative view, inspired by recent evidence from my lab and others, as well as by reexamining existing models of episodic recall that suggests that this notion of mentally revisiting any specific moment of our past is at best incomplete and at worst misleading. Instead, I suggest that we retrieve information from our past by mentally casting ourselves back simultaneously to many time points from our past, much like a quantum wave function spreading its probability mass over many possible states. This revised conceptual model makes important behavioral and neural predictions about how we retrieve information about our past, and has implications for how we study episodic memory experimentally.

TI Para-particle oscillator simulations on a trapped-ion quantum computer
SO JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYSICS
AB Deformed oscillators allow for a generalization of the standard fermions and bosons, namely, for the description of para-particles. Such particles remain hypothetical and unobserved in nature; yet, they can model physical phenomena, such as topological phases of matter. Here, we report the digital quantum simulation of para-particle oscillators by mapping para-particle states to the state of a qubit register, which allows us to identify the para-particle oscillator Hamiltonian as an XY model and further digitize the system onto a universal set of gates. In both instances, the gate depth grows polynomially with the number of qubits used. To establish the validity of our results, we experimentally simulate the dynamics of para-fermions and para-bosons, demonstrating full control of para-particle oscillators on a quantum computer. Furthermore, we compare the overall performance of the digital simulation of dynamics of the driven para-Fermi oscillator to a recent analog quantum simulation result. (c) 2025 Author(s).

TI Design and analysis of parallel quantum transfer fractal priority replay
   with dynamic memory algorithm in quantum reinforcement learning for
   robotics
SO IET QUANTUM COMMUNICATION
AB This paper introduces the parallel quantum transfer fractal priority reply with dynamic memory (P-QTFPR-DM) algorithm, an innovative approach that combines quantum computing and reinforcement learning (RL) to enhance decision-making in autonomous vehicles. Leveraging quantum principles such as superposition and entanglement, P-QTFPR-DM optimises Q-value approximation through a custom quantum circuit (UQC), facilitating efficient exploration and exploitation in high-dimensional state-action spaces. This algorithm utilises a quantum neural network (QNN) with 4 qubits to encode and process Q-values. The autonomous vehicle, equipped with GPS for real-time navigation, uses P-QTFPR-DM to reach a predefined destination with coordinates 12.82,514,234,148 latitude and 80.0,451,311,962,242 longitude. Through extensive numerical simulations, P-QTFPR-DM demonstrates a 30% reduction in decision-making time and a 25% improvement in navigation accuracy compared to classical RL methods. The QNN-based approach achieves a 95% success rate in reaching the destination within a 5-m accuracy threshold, whereas traditional RL methods achieve only an 85% success rate. Dynamic memory management in P-QTFPR-DM optimises computational resources, enhancing the vehicle's adaptability to environmental changes. These results highlight the potential of quantum computing to significantly advance autonomous vehicle technology by improving both efficiency and effectiveness in complex navigation tasks. Future research will focus on refining the algorithm and exploring its real-world applications to enhance autonomous vehicle performance.
   The parallel quantum transfer fractal priority reply with dynamic memory (P-QTFPR-DM) algorithm integrates quantum computing principles with reinforcement learning techniques to enhance decision-making in robotics. By encoding Q-values into probabilities using custom quantum circuits (UQC) and leveraging quantum parallelism, P-QTFPR-DM enables rapid and adaptive navigation of dynamic environments. Empirical analysis demonstrates its superior efficiency and adaptability compared to classical approaches, representing a significant advancement in quantum computing for robotics reinforcement learning. image

TI Polarization and Orbital Angular Momentum Encoded Quantum Toffoli Gate
   Enabled by Diffractive Neural Networks
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB Controlled quantum gates play a crucial role in enabling quantum universal operations by facilitating interactions between qubits. Direct implementation of three-qubit gates simplifies the design of quantum circuits, thereby being conducive to performing complex quantum algorithms. Here, we propose and present an experimental demonstration of a quantum Toffoli gate fully exploiting the polarization and orbital angular momentum of a single photon. The Toffoli gate is implemented using the polarized diffractive neural networks scheme, achieving a mean truth table visibility of 97.27 +/- 0.20%. We characterize the gate's performance through quantum state tomography on 216 different input states and quantum process tomography, which yields a process fidelity of 94.05 +/- 0.02%. Our method offers a novel approach for realizing the Toffoli gate without requiring exponential optical elements while maintaining extensibility to the implementation of other three-qubit gates.

TI Multiuser all-optical quantum network based on metasurfaces
SO SCIENCE ADVANCES
AB A crucial aspect of quantum information is the establishment of multiuser quantum networks, ensuring secure transmission of information among separated users. However, establishing a large-scale network remains a substantial challenge, requiring massive and compact Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR) entangled states. Here, we experimentally generate a 5 by 5 continuous variable (CV) EPR entanglement array using a metalens array. Moreover, on the basis of such a compact EPR entanglement array, we establish a five-user all-optical quantum state sharing (AOQSS) network with fidelity beating the corresponding classical limit, which is currently the largest AOQSS network in the CV regime. These results provide a promising platform for the generation of massive and compact EPR entangled states and the construction of large-scale all-optical multiuser quantum networks. Our compact approach for generating CV EPR entanglement based on metasurface opens up avenues for advanced quantum networks.

TI Performance analysis of a filtering variational quantum algorithm
SO NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB Even a minor boost in solving combinatorial optimization problems can greatly benefit multiple industries. Quantum computers, with their unique information processing capabilities, hold promise for delivering such enhancements. The filtering variational quantum eigensolver (F-VQE) is a variational hybrid quantum algorithm designed to solve combinatorial optimization problems on existing quantum computers with limited qubit number, connectivity, and fidelity. In this work we employ instantaneous quantum polynomial circuits as our parameterized quantum circuits. We propose a hardware-efficient implementation that respects limited qubit connectivity and show that they halve the number of circuits necessary to evaluate the gradient with the parameter-shift rule. To assess the potential of this protocol in the context of combinatorial optimization, we conduct extensive numerical analysis. We compare the performance against three classical baseline algorithms on weighted MaxCut and the asymmetric traveling salesperson problem (ATSP). We employ noiseless simulators for problems encoded on 13-29 qubits, and up to 37 qubits on the IBMQ real quantum devices. The ATSP encoding employed reduces the number of qubits and avoids the need of constraints compared to the standard quadratic unconstrained binary optimization/Ising model. Despite some observed positive signs, we conclude that significant development is necessary for a practical advantage with F-VQE.

TI An 11-qubit atom processor in silicon
SO NATURE
AB Phosphorus atoms in silicon represent a promising platform for quantum computing, as their nuclear spins exhibit coherence times over seconds1,2 with high-fidelity readout and single-qubit control3. By placing several phosphorus atoms within a radius of a few nanometres, they couple by means of the hyperfine interaction to a single, shared electron. Such a nuclear spin register enables high-fidelity multi-qubit control4 and the execution of small-scale quantum algorithms5. An important requirement for scaling up is the ability to extend high-fidelity entanglement non-locally across several spin registers. Here we address this challenge with an 11-qubit atom processor composed of two multi-nuclear spin registers that are linked by means of electron exchange interaction. Through the advancement of calibration and control protocols, we achieve single-qubit and multi-qubit gates with all fidelities ranging from 99.10% to 99.99%. By entangling all combinations of local and non-local nuclear-spin pairs, we map out the performance of the processor and achieve state-of-the-art Bell-state fidelities of up to 99.5%. We then generate Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) states with an increasing number of qubits and show entanglement of up to eight nuclear spins. By establishing high-fidelity operation across interconnected nuclear spin registers, we realize a key milestone towards fault-tolerant quantum computation with atom processors.

TI Direct moment estimation of intensity distribution of magnetic fields
   with quantum sensing network
SO NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB A quantum sensing network is used to simultaneously detect and measure physical quantities, such as magnetic fields, at different locations. However, there is a risk that the measurement data is leaked to the third party during the communication. Many theoretical and experimental efforts have been made to realize a secure quantum sensing network where a high level of security is guaranteed. In this paper, we propose a protocol to estimate statistical quantities of the target fields at different places without knowing individual value of the target fields. We generate an entanglement between L quantum sensors, let the quantum sensor interact with local fields, and perform specific measurements on them. By calculating the quantum Fisher information to estimate the individual value of the magnetic fields, we show that we cannot obtain any information of the value of the individual fields in the limit of large L. On the other hand, in our protocol, we can estimate theoretically any moment of the field distribution by measuring a specific observable and evaluated relative uncertainty of kth ( k=1,2,3,4) order moment. Our results are a significant step towards using a quantum sensing network with security inbuilt.

TI High success standard quantum teleportation using entangled coherent
   state and two-level atoms in cavities
SO QUANTUM INFORMATION PROCESSING
AB We propose here a new idea for quantum teleportation of superposed coherent state which circumvents the problem of performing non-unitary Z(c) = |alpha ><alpha|-|- alpha-alpha| operation on coherent state qubit. The receiver only requires to perform either no unitary operation or a pi phase shift in order to recreate the information state. We use entangled resource similar to | alpha, alpha/root 2> - | - alpha,-alpha/root 2 > in contrast with the usual similar to | alpha, alpha>|- alpha,- alpha> -(both states unnormalized). Bob receives state which is then superposition of the states | +/- alpha/root 2|. Bob mixes these with even or odd coherent states involving superposition of states | +/- alpha/root 2 to obtain a two-mode state which is one of similar to | I, 0 +/- |0, I>, | I > being the information state. Bob then obtains the teleported information by using the interaction of one of these modes in two cavities with resonant two-level atoms. This scheme results in average fidelity of similar or equal to 0.95 for |alpha|2 similar or equal to 10, which increases with |alpha|(2) and tends to 1 asymptotically, varying as 1 - pi(2)/16|alpha|(2) + pi(2)(pi(2)+ 8)/256|alpha|(4) for large values of |alpha|(2).

TI Simulating lattice quantum electrodynamics on a quantum computer
SO QUANTUM SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB U(1) lattice gauge theories (LGTs) offer a way to simulate quantum electrodynamics, one of the three forces unified by the Standard Model of particles physics. Here we provide complete, quantum-gate-by-quantum-gate algorithms to simulate U(1) LGTs on a fault-tolerant quantum computer. We further perform rigorous error analysis in order to derive concrete estimates of the quantum computational resources required for an accurate simulation of U(1) LGTs using a second-order product formula. We show that U(1) LGTs in any spatial dimension can be simulated using O tilde (T-3/2 N-3/2 lambda?(-1/2) ) non-Clifford T gates, where T is the simulation time, N is the number of lattice sites, lambda is the truncation parameter for the bosonic gauge fields, and ? is the simulation error. This work paves the way towards fault-tolerant quantum simulations of physical models closely related to the Standard Model of particle physics.

TI Collision Forgery Attack on the AES-OTR Algorithm under Quantum
   Computing
SO SYMMETRY-BASEL
AB In recent years, some general cryptographic technologies have been widely used in network platforms related to the national economy and people's livelihood, effectively curbing network security risks and maintaining the orderly operation and normal order of society. However, due to the fast development and considerable benefits of quantum computing, the classical cryptosystem faces serious security threats, so it is crucial to analyze and assess the anti-quantum computing ability of cryptographic algorithms under the quantum security model, to enhance or perfect the design defects of related algorithms. However, the current design and research of anti-quantum cryptography primarily focus on the cryptographic structure or working mode under the quantum security model, and there is a lack of quantum security analysis on instantiated cryptographic algorithms. This paper investigates the security of AES-OTR, one of the third-round algorithms in the CAESAR competition, under the Q2 model. The periodic functions of the associated data were constructed by forging the associated data according to the parallel and serial structure characteristics of the AES-OTR algorithm in processing the associated data, and the periodic functions of the associated data were constructed multiple times based on the Simon quantum algorithm. By using the collision pair, two collision forgery attacks on the AES-OTR algorithm can be successfully implemented, and the period s is obtained by solving with a probability close to 1. The attacks in this paper caused a significant threat to the security of the AES-OTR algorithm.

TI Exploring New Chemical Paths in Quantum AI: Preliminary Accomplishments
   and Future Perspectives
SO ADVANCED QUANTUM TECHNOLOGIES
AB Quantum Artificial Intelligence (QAI) refers to the integration of AI with quantum information science, with the dual objective of accelerating AI development and advancing quantum computing, sensing, and communication technologies. In this work, two innovative strategies for the development of an energetically sustainable quantum information science are proposed. Both strategies originate from the Chemical AI (CAI) research line, which aims to emulate biological intelligence by designing engineered chemical systems in liquid solutions, the characteristic phase of life. The first strategy involves implementing chemical fuzzy sets and processing fuzzy logic at the molecular level, which corresponds to manipulating thermalized quantum mixed states. Although quantum superposition, interference, entanglement, and tunneling are excluded, noteworthy advancements in quantum sensing, communicating, and computing are still within reach. The second strategy arises from neuromorphic engineering in wetware. In this context, photochromic compounds are employed as dynamic surrogates of neurons operating in the phasic excitable regime. These compounds are proposed as molecular candidates that can simulate certain features of qubits. Finally, perspectives on these two novel strategies, highlighting their potential to reshape the future of quantum information science beyond traditional qubit-based paradigms, are outlined.

TI Verifier-on-a-Leash: New Schemes for Verifiable Delegated Quantum
   Computation, with Quasilinear Resources
SO THEORY OF COMPUTING
AB The problem of reliably certifying the outcome of a computation performed by a quantum device is rapidly gaining relevance. We present two protocols for a classical verifier to verifiably delegate a quantum computation to two non-communicating but entangled quantum provers, with statistical soundness. Our protocols have near-optimal complexity in terms of the total resources employed by the verifier and the honest provers, with the total number of operations of each party, including the number of entangled pairs of qubits required of the honest provers, scaling as O (g log g) for delegating a circuit of size g. This is in contrast to previous protocols, whose overhead in terms of resources employed, while polynomial, is far beyond what is feasible in practice. Our first protocol requires a number of rounds that is linear in the depth of the circuit being delegated, and is blind, meaning neither prover can learn the circuit or its input. The second protocol is not blind, but requires only a constant number of rounds of interaction. Our main technical innovation is an efficient rigidity theorem that allows a verifier to test that two entangled provers perform measurements specified by an arbitrary m-qubit tensor product of single-qubit Clifford observables on their respective halves of m shared EPR pairs, with a robustness that is independent of m . Our two- prover classical-verifier delegation protocols are obtained by combining this rigidity theorem with a single-prover quantum-verifier protocol for the verifiable delegation of a quantum computation, introduced by Broadbent (Theory of Computing, 2018).

TI Influence of Noise in Entanglement-Based Quantum Networks
SO IEEE JOURNAL ON SELECTED AREAS IN COMMUNICATIONS
AB We consider entanglement-based quantum networks, where multipartite entangled resource states are distributed and stored among the nodes and locally manipulated upon request to establish the desired target configuration. Separating the generation process from the requests enables a pre-preparation of resources, hence a reduced network latency. It also allows for an optimization of the entanglement topology, which is independent of the underlying network geometry. We concentrate on establishing Bell pairs or tripartite GHZ states between arbitrary parties. We study the influence of noise in this process, where we consider imperfections in state preparation, memories, and measurements - all of which can be modeled by local depolarizing noise. We compare different resource states corresponding to linear chains, trees, or multi-dimensional rectangular clusters, as well as centralized topologies using bipartite or tripartite entangled states. We compute the fidelity of the target states using a recently established efficient method, the noisy stabilizer formalism, and identify the best resource states within these classes. This allows us to treat networks of large size containing millions of nodes. We find that in large networks, high-dimensional cluster states are favorable and lead to a significantly higher target state fidelity.

TI Qubit gate operations in elliptically trapped polariton condensates
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB We consider bosonic condensates of exciton-polaritons optically confined in elliptical traps. A superposition of two non-degenerated p-type states of the condensate oriented along the two main axes of the trap is represented by a point on a Bloch sphere, being considered as an optically tunable qubit. We describe a set of universal single-qubit gates resulting in a controllable shift of the Bloch vector by means of an auxiliary laser beam. Moreover, we consider interaction mechanisms between two neighboring traps that enable designing two-qubit operations such as CPHASE and CNOT gates. Both the single- and two-qubit gates are analyzed in the presence of error sources in the context of polariton traps, such as pure dephasing and spontaneous relaxation mechanisms, leading to a fidelity reduction of the final qubit states and quantum concurrence, as well as the increase of Von Neumann entropy. We also discuss the applicability of our qubit proposal in the context of DiVincenzo's criteria for the realization of local quantum computing processes. Altogether, the developed set of quantum operations would pave the way to the realization of a variety of quantum algorithms in a planar microcavity with a set of optically induced elliptical traps.

TI Phase Diagram and Quantum Entanglement Properties of a Pentamer
   S=1/2 Heisenberg Spin Cluster
SO MOLECULES
AB Cluster molecular magnets prove their potential for applications in quantum technologies, encouraging studies of quantum entanglement in spin systems. In the paper we discuss quantum entanglement properties of pentamer cluster composed of spins S = 1/2 forming a tetrahedron with additional spin in its center, with geometry reproducing the smallest nonplanar graph. We model the system with isotropic Heisenberg Hamiltonian including external magnetic field and use exact diagonalization approach to explore the ground-state phase diagram and thermodynamic properties within canonical ensemble formalism. We focus the interest on two-spin entanglement quantified by Wootters concurrence. For ground state, we find two states with total cluster spin equal to 3/2 exhibiting entanglement, occurring preferably for antiferromagnetic interactions. For finite temperatures, we predict the presence of magnetic-field-induced entanglement as well as temperature-induced entanglement.

TI Quantum coding with finite thermodynamic resources
SO QUANTUM SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB Quantum direct coding or Schumacher compression generalised the ideas of Shannon theory, gave an operational meaning to the von Neumann entropy and established the term qubit. But remembering that information processing is carried out by physical processes prompts one to wonder what thermodynamic resources are required to compress quantum information and how they constrain one's ability to perform this task. That is, if Alice and Bob only have access to thermal quantum states and clocks with finite accuracy, how well can they measure, encode and decode pure quantum state messages? In this work we examine these questions by modeling Alice's typical measurement as a unitary involving a measurement probe, investigating imperfect timekeeping on encoding and decoding and considering the role of temperature in Bob's appended qubits. In doing so, we derive fidelity bounds for this protocol involving the correlations Alice can form with their measurement probe, the variance of the clock's ticks and the temperature of Bob's qubits. Finally, we give an insight into the entropy produced by these two agents throughout the compression protocol by relating the resources they use to a quantum thermodynamic cooling protocol.

TI High-rate extended binomial codes for multiqubit encoding
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB We introduce a class of bosonic quantum error-correcting codes, termed extended binomial codes, which generalize the structure of one-mode binomial codes by incorporating ideas from high-rate qubit stabilizer codes. These codes are constructed in close analogy to [[n, k, d]] qubit codes, where the parameter n corresponds to the total excitation budget rather than the number of physical qubits. Our construction achieves a significant reduction in average excitation per mode while preserving error-correcting capabilities, offering improved compatibility with hardware constraints in the strong-dispersive regime. We demonstrate that extended binomial codes not only reduce the mean excitation required for encoding but also simplify syndrome extraction and logical gate implementation, particularly the logical X<overline> operation. These advantages suggest that extended binomial codes offer a scalable and resource-efficient approach for bosonic quantum error correction.

TI LINEAR DEPENDENT TYPE THEORY FOR QUANTUM PROGRAMMING LANGUAGES
SO LOGICAL METHODS IN COMPUTER SCIENCE
AB Modern quantum programming languages integrate quantum resources and classical control. They must, on the one hand, be linearly typed to reflect the no-cloning property of quantum resources. On the other hand, high-level and practical languages should also support quantum circuits as first-class citizens, as well as families of circuits that are indexed by some classical parameters. Quantum programming languages thus need linear dependent type theory. This paper defines a general semantic structure for such a type theory via certain fibrations of monoidal categories. The categorical model of the quantum circuit description language Proto-Quipper-M in [RS17] constitutes an example of such a fibration, which means that the language can readily be integrated with dependent types. We then devise both a general linear dependent type system and a dependently typed extension of Proto-Quipper-M, and provide them with operational semantics as well as a prototype implementation.

TI Multi-Channel Quantum Dot Single-Photon Sources on a Fiber-Integrated
   Platform
SO ADVANCED OPTICAL MATERIALS
AB Scalable, reliable quantum light sources are essential for increasing quantum channel capacity and advancing quantum protocols based on photonic qubits. Although recent developments in solid-state quantum emitters have enabled the generation of single photons with high performance, the scalable integration of multiple quantum light sources onto practical optical platforms remains a challenging task. Here, a breakthrough in achieving a multiple, tunable array of quantum photonic devices is presented. An individual device transfer process allows post-characterization and selective integration of multiple single-photon sources onto a V-groove fiber platform. The nanophotonic cavity ensures efficient coupling of single photons into a standard SMF 28 fiber. Moreover, applying an electric field enables a frequency shift of the integrated single-photon device. Therefore, the fiber-integrated quantum platform realizes a scalable and reliable single-photon array within a compact fiber chip at telecom wavelengths.

TI Novel Quantum Algorithms to Minimize Switching Functions Based on Graph
   Partitions
SO CMC-COMPUTERS MATERIALS & CONTINUA
AB After Google reported its realization of quantum supremacy, Solving the classical problems with quantum computing is becoming a valuable research topic. Switching function minimization is an important problem in Electronic Design Automation (EDA) and logic synthesis, most of the solutions are based on heuristic algorithms with a classical computer, it is a good practice to solve this problem with a quantum processer. In this paper, we introduce a new hybrid classic quantum algorithm using Grover's algorithm and symmetric functions to minimize small Disjoint Sum of Product (DSOP) and Sum of Product (SOP) for Boolean switching functions. Our method is based on graph partitions for arbitrary graphs to regular graphs, which can be solved by a Grover-based quantum searching algorithm we proposed. The Oracle for this quantum algorithm is built from Boolean symmetric functions and implemented with Lattice diagrams. It is shown analytically and verified by simulations on a quantum simulator that our methods can find all solutions to these problems.

TI Dilation Theorem Via Schrodingerization, With Applications to the
   Quantum Simulation of Differential Equations
SO STUDIES IN APPLIED MATHEMATICS
AB Nagy's unitary dilation theorem in the operator theory asserts the possibility of dilating a contraction into a unitary operator. When used in quantum computing, its practical implementation primarily relies on block-encoding techniques, based on finite-dimensional scenarios. In this study, we delve into the recently devised Schrodingerization approach and demonstrate its viability as an alternative dilation technique. This approach is applicable to operators in the form of v(t)=exp(-At), which arises in wide-ranging applications, particularly in solving linear ordinary and partial differential equations. Importantly, the Schrodingerization approach is adaptable to both finite- and infinite-dimensional cases, in both countable and uncountable domains. For quantum systems lying in infinite-dimensional Hilbert space, the dilation involves adding a single infinite dimensional mode, and this is the continuous-variable version of the Schrodingerization procedure which makes it suitable for analog quantum computing. Furthermore, by discretizing continuous variables, the Schrodingerization method can also be effectively employed in finite-dimensional scenarios suitable for qubit-based quantum computing.

TI Nonunitary gate operations by dissipation engineering
SO QUANTUM SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB Irreversible logic is at odds with unitary quantum evolution. Emulating such operations by classical measurements can result in disturbances and high resource demands. To overcome these limitations, we propose protocols that harness dissipation to realize the nonunitary evolution required for irreversible gate operations. Using additional excited states subject to decay, we engineer effective decay processes that perform the desired gate operations on the smallest stable Hilbert space. These operate deterministically and in an autonomous fashion, without the need for measurements. We exemplify our approach considering several classical logic operations, such as the OR, NOR, and XOR gates. Towards experimental realization, we discuss a possible implementation in quantum dots. Our study shows that irreversible logic operations can be efficiently performed on realistic quantum systems and that dissipation engineering is an essential tool for obtaining nonunitary evolutions. The proposed operations expand the quantum engineers' toolbox and have promising applications in NISQ algorithms and quantum machine learning.

TI eMultinucleon structure and dynamics via quantum computing
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB We propose a framework for computing the structure and dynamics for second-quantized many-nucleon Hamiltonians on quantum computers. We develop an oracle-based Hamiltonian input model that computes the many-nucleon states and nonzero Hamiltonian matrix elements of the many-nucleon system. With our Fock-state based input model, we show how to implement the sparse matrix simulation algorithms to calculate the dynamics of the second-quantized many-nucleon Hamiltonian. Based on the dynamics simulation methods, we also present the methodology for structure calculations of the many-nucleon system. In this work, we provide an explicit circuit design of our input model of the second-quantized Hamiltonian within a direct encoding scheme that maps the occupation of each available single-particle state in the many-nucleon state to the state of specific qubit in a quantum register. We analyze our method and provide the asymptotic cost in computing resources for structure and dynamics calculations of many-nucleon systems. For pedagogical purposes, we demonstrate our input model with two model problems in restricted model spaces.

TI Best-Practice Aspects of Quantum-Computer Calculations: A Case Study of
   the Hydrogen Molecule
SO MOLECULES
AB Quantum computers are reaching one crucial milestone after another. Motivated by their progress in quantum chemistry, we performed an extensive series of simulations of quantum-computer runs that were aimed at inspecting the best-practice aspects of these calculations. In order to compare the performance of different setups, the ground-state energy of the hydrogen molecule was chosen as a benchmark for which the exact solution exists in the literature. Applying the variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) to a qubit Hamiltonian obtained by the Bravyi-Kitaev transformation, we analyzed the impact of various computational technicalities. These included (i) the choice of the optimization methods, (ii) the architecture of the quantum circuits, as well as (iii) the different types of noise when simulating real quantum processors. On these, we eventually performed a series of experimental runs as a complement to our simulations. The simultaneous perturbation stochastic approximation (SPSA) and constrained optimization by linear approximation (COBYLA) optimization methods clearly outperformed the Nelder-Mead and Powell methods. The results obtained when using the Ry variational form were better than those obtained when the RyRz form was used. The choice of an optimum entangling layer was sensitively interlinked with the choice of the optimization method. The circular entangling layer was found to worsen the performance of the COBYLA method, while the full-entangling layer improved it. All four optimization methods sometimes led to an energy that corresponded to an excited state rather than the ground state. We also show that a similarity analysis of measured probabilities can provide a useful insight.

AB Machine learning has achieved dramatic success in a broad spectrum of applications. Its interplay with quantum physics may lead to unprecedented perspectives for both fundamental research and commercial applications, giving rise to an emergent research frontier of quantum machine learning. Along this line, quantum classifiers, which are quantum devices that aim to solve classification problems in machine learning, have attracted tremendous attention recently. In this review, we give a relatively comprehensive overview for the studies of quantum classifiers, with a focus on recent advances. First, we will review a number of quantum classification algorithms, including quantum support vector machines, quantum kernel methods, quantum decision tree classifiers, quantum nearest neighbor algorithms, and quantum annealing based classifiers. Then, we move on to introduce the variational quantum classifiers, which are essentially variational quantum circuits for classifications. We will review different architectures for constructing variational quantum classifiers and introduce the barren plateau problem, where the training of quantum classifiers might be hindered by the exponentially vanishing gradient. In addition, the vulnerability aspect of quantum classifiers in the setting of adversarial learning and the recent experimental progress on different quantum classifiers will also be discussed.

AB The escalating threat and impact of network-based attacks necessitate innovative intrusion detection systems. Machine learning has shown promise, with recent strides in quantum machine learning offering new avenues. However, the potential of quantum computing is tempered by challenges in current noisy intermediate-scale quantum era machines. In this article, we explore quantum neural networks (QNNs) for intrusion detection, optimizing their performance within current quantum computing limitations. Our approach includes efficient classical feature encoding, QNN classifier selection, and performance tuning leveraging current quantum computational power. This study culminates in an optimized multilayered QNN architecture for network intrusion detection. A small version of the proposed architecture was implemented on IonQ's Aria-1 quantum computer, achieving a notable 0.86 F1 score using the NF-UNSW-NB15 dataset. In addition, we introduce a novel metric, certainty factor, laying the foundation for future integration of uncertainty measures in quantum classification outputs. Moreover, this factor is used to predict the noise susceptibility of our quantum binary classification system.

Current calibration techniques require complicated and verbose measurements to tune up qubits and gates, which cannot easily expand to the large-scale quantum systems. We develop a concise and automatic calibration protocol to characterize qubits and optimize gates using QubiC, which is an open source FPGA (field-programmable gate array)-based control and measurement system for superconducting quantum information processors. We propose multi-dimensional loss-based optimization of single-qubit gates and full XY-plane measurement method for the two-qubit CNOT gate calibration. We demonstrate the QubiC automatic calibration protocols are capable of delivering high-fidelity gates on the state-of-the-art transmon-type processor operating at the Advanced Quantum Testbed at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. The single-qubit and two-qubit Clifford gate infidelities measured by randomized benchmarking are of 4.9(1.1) x 10(-4) and 1.4(3) x 10(-2), respectively.

TI Characterizing correlated noise with single-qubit operations
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Spatially correlated noise poses a significant challenge to fault-tolerant quantum computation by breaking the assumption of independent errors. Existing methods such as cycle benchmarking and quantum process tomography can characterize noise correlations but require substantial resources. We propose straightforward and efficient techniques to detect and quantify these correlations by leveraging collective phenomena arising from environmental correlations in a qubit register. In these techniques, single-qubit state preparations, single-qubit gates, and single-qubit measurements, combined with classical postprocessing, suffice to uncover correlated relaxation and dephasing. Specifically, we use that correlated relaxation is connected to the superradiance effect, which we show to be accessible by single-qubit measurements. Analogously, the established parity oscillation protocol can be refined to quantify correlated dephasing without requiring the preparation of complex and entangled states.

With the advent of physical quantum computers, it has become possible to apply quantum machine learning algorithms to translate theoretical research into practical solutions. Previous studies have shown the advantages of quantum algorithms on artificially generated datasets, and initial experiments with small binary classification problems have yielded comparable outcomes to classical algorithms. However, it is essential to investigate the potential quantum advantage using real-world data. To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first to propose the utilization of quantum systems to classify neuron morphologies, thereby enhancing our understanding of the performance of automatic multiclass neuron classification using quantum kernel methods. We examined the influence of feature engineering on classification accuracy and found that quantum kernel methods achieved similar performance to classical methods, with certain advantages observed in various configurations.

TI A Systematic Literature Review of Quantum Computing for Routing Problems
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB Quantum Computing is drawing a significant attention from the current scientific community. The potential advantages offered by this revolutionary paradigm has led to an upsurge of scientific production in different fields such as economics, industry, or logistics. The main purpose of this paper is to collect, organize and systematically examine the literature published so far on the application of Quantum Computing to routing problems. To do this, we embrace the well-established procedure named as Systematic Literature Review. Specifically, we provide a unified, self-contained, and end-to-end review of 18 years of research (from 2004 to 2021) in the intersection of Quantum Computing and routing problems through the analysis of 53 different papers. Several interesting conclusions have been drawn from this analysis, which has been formulated to give a comprehensive summary of the current state of the art by providing answers related to the most recurrent type of study (practical or theoretical), preferred solving approaches (dedicated or hybrid), detected open challenges or most used Quantum Computing device, among others.

AB An n-qubit quantum circuit is said to be peaked if it has an output probability that is at least inverse-polynomially large as a function of n. We describe a classical algorithm with quasipolynomial runtime n(O(logn)) that approximately samples from the output distribution of a peaked constant-depth circuit. We give even faster algorithms for circuits composed of nearest-neighbor gates on a D-dimensional grid of qubits, with polynomial runtime n(O(1)) if D=2 and almost-polynomial runtime n(O(loglogn)) for D > 2. Our sampling algorithms can be used to estimate output probabilities of shallow circuits to within a given inverse-polynomial additive error, improving previously known methods. As a simple application, we obtain a quasipolynomial algorithm to estimate the magnitude of the expected value of any Pauli observable in the output state of a shallow circuit (which may or may not be peaked). This is a dramatic improvement over the prior state-of-the-art algorithm which had an exponential scaling in root n.

TI Hybrid superconducting-ferroelectric quantum memristor
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB The nontrivial integration of qubits with classical computing systems and the lack of quantum-memory devices remain a key obstacle in the development of quantum technologies. Here, we present a theoretical platform for hybrid quantum devices with memory characteristics. In these current-driven hybrid memristors, a ferroelectric layer serves as the tunneling barrier in a superconducting Josephson junction; thus, the potential barrier is history-dependent. A memory-integrated phase qubit and a Lagrangian description of the superconducting circuit are also presented, paving the way to highly functional, self-modulated Josephson-junction technologies.

TI Closed-loop control of a noisy qubit with reinforcement learning
SO MACHINE LEARNING-SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB The exotic nature of quantum mechanics differentiates machine learning applications in the quantum realm from classical ones. Stream learning is a powerful approach that can be applied to extract knowledge continuously from quantum systems in a wide range of tasks. In this paper, we propose a deep reinforcement learning method that uses streaming data from a continuously measured qubit in the presence of detuning, dephasing, and relaxation. The model receives streaming quantum information for learning and decision-making, providing instant feedback on the quantum system. We also explore the agent's adaptability to other quantum noise patterns through transfer learning. Our protocol offers insights into closed-loop quantum control, potentially advancing the development of quantum technologies.

TI Accelerating Grover Adaptive Search: Qubit and Gate Count Reduction
   Strategies With Higher Order Formulations
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON QUANTUM ENGINEERING
AB Grover adaptive search (GAS) is a quantum exhaustive search algorithm designed to solve binary optimization problems. In this article, we propose higher order binary formulations that can simultaneously reduce the numbers of qubits and gates required for GAS. Specifically, we consider two novel strategies: one that reduces the number of gates through polynomial factorization, and the other that halves the order of the objective function, subsequently decreasing circuit runtime and implementation cost. Our analysis demonstrates that the proposed higher order formulations improve the convergence performance of GAS by reducing both the search space size and the number of quantum gates. Our strategies are also beneficial for general combinatorial optimization problems using one-hot encoding.

TI Probing quantum correlations in many-body systems: a review of scalable
   methods
SO REPORTS ON PROGRESS IN PHYSICS
AB We review methods that allow one to detect and characterize quantum correlations in many-body systems, with a special focus on approaches which are scalable. Namely, those applicable to systems with many degrees of freedom, without requiring a number of measurements or computational resources to analyze the data that scale exponentially with the system size. We begin with introducing the concepts of quantum entanglement, Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen steering, and Bell nonlocality in the bipartite scenario, to then present their multipartite generalization. We review recent progress on characterizing these quantum correlations from partial information on the system state, such as through data-driven methods or witnesses based on low-order moments of collective observables. We then review state-of-the-art experiments that demonstrate the preparation, manipulation and detection of highly-entangled many-body systems. For each platform (e.g. atoms, ions, photons, superconducting circuits) we illustrate the available toolbox for state preparation and measurement, emphasizing the challenges that each system poses. To conclude, we present a list of timely open problems in the field.

TI Thermometry utilizing stored short-wavelength spin waves in cold atomic
   ensembles
SO CHINESE PHYSICS B
AB Temperature, as a measure of thermal motion, is a significant parameter characterizing a cold atomic ensemble optical quantum memory. In a cold gas, storage lifetime strongly depends on its temperature and is associated with the spin wave decoherence. Here we experimentally demonstrate a new spin wave thermometry method relying on this direct dependence. The short-wavelength spin waves resulting from the counter-propagating configuration of the control and the probe laser beams make this thermometry highly suitable for probing in situ the atomic motion in elongated clouds as the ones used in quantum memories. Our technique is realized with comparable precision for memories that rely on electromagnetically induced transparency as well as far-detuned Raman storage.

TI A quantum register using collective excitations in a Bose-Einstein
   condensate
SO SCIPOST PHYSICS
AB A qubit made up of an ensemble of atoms is attractive due to its resistance to atom losses. In this work, we consider an experimentally feasible protocol to coherently load a spin-dependent optical lattice from a spatially overlapping Bose-Einstein condensate. Identifying each lattice site as a qubit, with an empty or filled site as the qubit basis, we discuss how high-fidelity single-qubit operations, two-qubit gates between arbitrary pairs of qubits, and nondestructive measurements could be performed. In this setup, the effect of atom losses has been mitigated, the atoms never need to be removed from the ground state manifold, and separate storage and computational bases for the qubits are not required, all of which can be significant sources of decoherence in many other types of atomic qubits.

AB Quantum computers require a coordinated operation on a large number of quantum bits (qubits), presenting considerable obstacles such as system integration on a large scale, individual qubits control with precision, and significant error correction overhead. Silicon (Si) quantum dot (QD) spin qubits paired with CMOS control circuits promise a scalable solution due to its potential for large-scale integration utilizing well-established semiconductor technologies. This paper proposes a control addressing scheme for QD spin qubits operating on a node network architecture. Compared to the typical 2-dimensional array architecture, this approach considerably lowers the area constraint for control signal routing. Scalable circuits are designed to route the control signals for local and global operations of a surface code quantum error correction through the modular design of tiered switches controlled by demultiplexers. The proposed method is a critical step toward implementing scalable solid-state quantum processors.

TI Macroscopic Bell state between a millimeter-sized spin system and a
   superconducting qubit
SO QUANTUM SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB Entanglement is a fundamental property in quantum mechanics that systems share inseparable quantum correlation regardless of their mutual distances. Owing to the fundamental significance and versatile applications, the generation of quantum entanglement between macroscopic systems has been a focus of current research. Here we report on the deterministic generation and tomography of the macroscopically entangled Bell state in a hybrid quantum system containing a millimeter-sized spin system ( similar to 1 x 10 19 atoms) and a micrometer-sized superconducting qubit. The deterministic generation is realized by coupling the macroscopic spin system and the qubit via a microwave cavity. Also, we develop a joint tomography approach to confirming the deterministic generation of the Bell state, which gives a generation fidelity of 0.90 +/- 0.01 . Our work makes the macroscopic spin system the largest system (in the sense of atom number) capable of generating the maximally entangled quantum state.

TI Quantum Nondemolition Measurements with Optical Parametric Amplifiers
   for Ultrafast Universal Quantum Information Processing
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB Realization of a room-temperature ultrafast photon-number-resolving quantum nondemolition (QND) measurement would have significant implications for photonic quantum information processing, enabling, for example, deterministic quantum computation in discrete-variable architectures, but the requirement for strong coupling has hampered the development of scalable implementations. In this work, we propose and analyze a nonlinear-optical route to photon-number-resolving QND using quadratic (i.e., chi(2)) non-linear interactions. We show that the coherent pump field driving a frequency-detuned optical parametric amplifier (OPA) experiences displacements conditioned on the number of signal Bogoliubov excitations. A measurement of the pump displacement thus provides a QND measurement of the signal Bogoliubov excitations, projecting the signal mode to a squeezed photon-number state. We then show how our non-linear OPA dynamics can be utilized to deterministically generate Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill states with only additional Gaussian resources, offering an all-optical route for fault-tolerant quantum information processing in continuous-variable systems. Finally, we place these QND schemes into a more tradi-tional context by highlighting analogies between the frequency-detuned optical parametric oscillator and multilevel atom-cavity quantum electrodynamics systems by showing how continuous monitoring of the outcoupled pump quadrature induces conditional localization of the intracavity signal mode onto squeezed photon-number states. Our analysis suggests that our proposal may be viable in near-term chi(2) nonlinear nanophotonics, highlighting the rich potential of the OPA as a universal tool for ultrafast non-Gaussian quantum state engineering and quantum computation.

Recent findings have brought wide attention to the role of quantum mechanisms in the function and regulation of biological processes. Moreover, a number of activities have been integral in building a vibrant quantum biology community. Due to the inherent interdisciplinary nature of the field, it is a challenge for quantum biology researchers to integrate and advance findings across the physical and biological disciplines. Here we outline achievable approaches to developing a shared platform-including the establishment of standardized manipulation tools and sensors, and a common scientific lexicon. Building a shared community framework is also crucial for fostering robust interdisciplinary collaborations, enhancing knowledge sharing, and diversifying participation in quantum biology. A unified approach promises not only to deepen our understanding of biological systems at a quantum level but also to accelerate the frontiers of medical and technological innovations.

TI Quantum state engineering by steering in the presence of errors
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Quantum state engineering plays a vital role in various applications in the field of quantum information. Different strategies, including drive-and-dissipation, adiabatic cooling, and measurement-based steering, have been proposed for state generation and manipulation, each with its upsides and downsides. Here, we address a class of measurement-based state engineering protocols where a sequence of generalized measurements is employed to steer a quantum system toward a desired (pure or mixed) target state. Previously studied measurement-based protocols relied on idealized procedures and avoided exploration of the effects of various errors stemming from imperfections of experimental realizations and external noise. We employ the quantum trajectory formalism to provide a detailed analysis of the robustness of these steering protocols against multiple classes of errors. We study a set of realistic errors that can be classified as dynamic or static, depending on whether they remain unchanged while running the protocol. More specifically, we investigate the impact of the erroneous choice of detector-system coupling, erroneous re-initialization of the detector state following a measurement step, fluctuating steering directions, and environmentally induced errors in the detector-system interaction. We show that the protocol remains fully robust against the erroneous choice of detector-system coupling parameters and presents reasonable robustness against other types of errors. Our analysis employs various quantifiers such as fidelity, trace distance, and linear entropy to characterize the protocol's robustness and provide analytical results for these quantifiers against various errors. We introduce averaging hierarchies of stochastic equations describing individual quantum trajectories associated with detector readouts. Subsequently, we demonstrate the commutation between the classical expectation value and the time-ordering operator of the exponential of a Hamiltonian with multiplicative white noise, as well as the commutation of the expectation value and the partial trace with respect to detector outcomes. Our ideas are implemented and demonstrated for a specific class of steering platforms, addressing a single qubit.

TI Universal single-server blind quantum computation for classical clients
SO LASER PHYSICS LETTERS
AB Blind quantum computation (BQC) allows a client without enough quantum technologies to delegate her quantum computation to a remote quantum server, while keeping her input, output and algorithm secure. In this paper, we propose a universal single-server and almost-classical-client BQC protocol. In this protocol, the client interfaces with only one server and the only ability of the client required is to get particles from the trusted center and forward them to the server. We present an analysis of this protocol and modify it to a universal single-server and fully-classical-client BQC protocol by improving the ability of the trusted center. Based on our protocols and recent works, a new 'Cloud + Certificate Authority (CA)' style is proposed for the BQC.

TI Universal fault-tolerant quantum computing with stabilizer codes
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB The quantum logic gates used in the design of a quantum computer should be both universal, meaning arbitrary quantum computations can be performed, and fault-tolerant, meaning the gates keep errors from cascading out of control. A number of no-go theorems constrain the ways in which a set of fault-tolerant logic gates can be universal. These theorems are very restrictive, and conventional wisdom holds that a universal fault-tolerant logic gate set cannot be implemented natively, requiring us to use costly distillation procedures for quantum computation. Here, we present a general framework for universal fault-tolerant logic with stabilizer codes, together with a no-go theorem that reveals the very broad conditions constraining such gate sets. Our theorem applies to a wide range of stabilizer code families, including concatenated codes and conventional topological stabilizer codes such as the surface code. The broad applicability of our no-go theorem provides a new perspective on how the constraints on universal fault-tolerant gate sets can be overcome. In particular, we show how nonunitary implementations of logic gates provide a general approach to circumvent the no-go theorem, and we present a rich landscape of constructions for logic gate sets that are both universal and fault-tolerant. That is, rather than restricting what is possible, our no-go theorem provides a signpost to guide us to new, efficient architectures for fault-tolerant quantum computing.

TI Scalable multimode entanglement based on efficient squeezing of
   propagation eigenmodes
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Continuous-variable encoding of quantum information in the optical domain has recently yielded large temporal and spectral entangled states instrumental for quantum computing and quantum communication. We introduce a protocol for the generation of spatial multipartite entanglement based on phase-matching of a propagation eigenmode in a monolithic photonic device: the array of quadratic nonlinear waveguides. We theoretically demonstrate in the spontaneous parametric downconversion regime the generation of large multipartite entangled states useful for multimode quantum networks. Our protocol is remarkably simple and robust as it does not rely on specific values of coupling, nonlinearity, or length of the sample.

TI Universal approximation of continuous functions with minimal quantum
   circuits
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB The conventional paradigm of quantum computing is discrete: It utilizes discrete sets of gates to realize bitstring-to-bitstring mappings, some of them arguably intractable for classical computers. In parametrized quantum approaches, the input becomes continuous and the output represents real-valued functions. While the universality of discrete quantum computers is well understood, basic questions remained open in the continuous case. We focus on universality of multivariate functions. Current approaches require either a number of qubits scaling linearly with the dimension of the input for fixed encodings or a tunable encoding procedure in single-qubit circuits. The question of whether universality can be reached with a fixed encoding and sublinearly many qubits remained open for the last five years. In this paper, we answer this question in the affirmative for arbitrary multivariate functions. We provide two methods: (1) a single-qubit circuit where each coordinate of the arguments to the function to represent is input independently and (2) a multiqubit approach where all coordinates are input in one step, with number of qubits scaling logarithmically with the dimension of the argument of the function of interest. We view the first result of inherent and fundamental interest, whereas the second result opens the path toward representing functions whose arguments are densely encoded in a unitary operation, possibly encoding, for instance, quantum processes.

TI Quantum-Resistant Network for Classical Client Compatibility
SO INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY AND CONTROL
AB Quantum computing is no longer a thing of the future. Shor's algorithm proved that a quantum computer could traverse key of factoring problems in polynomial time. Because the time-complexity of the exhaustive key search for quantum computing has not reliably exceeded the reasonable expiry of crypto key validity, it is believed that current cryptography systems built on top of computational security are not quantum-safe. Quantum key distribution fundamentally solves the problem of eavesdropping; nevertheless, it requires quantum preparatory work and quantum-network infrastructure, and these remain unrealistic with classical computers. In transitioning to a mature quantum world, developing a quantum-resistant mechanism becomes a stringent problem. In this research, we innovatively tackled this challenge using a non-computational difficulty scheme with zero-knowledge proof in order to achieve repellency against quantum computing cryptanalysis attacks for universal classical clients.

TI Advancing hybrid quantum-classical computation with real-time execution
SO FRONTIERS IN PHYSICS
AB The use of mid-circuit measurement and qubit reset within quantum programs has been introduced recently and several applications demonstrated that perform conditional branching based on these measurements. In this work, we go a step further and describe a next-generation implementation of classical computation embedded within quantum programs that enables the real-time calculation and adjustment of program variables based on the mid-circuit state of measured qubits. A full-featured Quantum Intermediate Representation (QIR) model is used to describe the quantum circuit including its embedded classical computation. This integrated approach eliminates the need to evaluate and store a potentially prohibitive volume of classical data within the quantum program in order to explore multiple solution paths. It enables a new type of quantum algorithm that requires fewer round-trips between an external classical driver program and the execution of the quantum program, significantly reducing computational latency, as much of the classical computation can be performed during the coherence time of quantum program execution. We review practical challenges to implementing this approach along with developments underway to address these challenges. An implementation of this novel and powerful quantum programming pattern, a random walk phase estimation algorithm, is demonstrated on a physical quantum computer with an analysis of its benefits and feasibility as compared to existing quantum computing methods.

TI State Preparation in Quantum Algorithms for Fragment-Based Quantum
   Chemistry
SO JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL THEORY AND COMPUTATION
AB State preparation for quantum algorithms is crucial for achieving high accuracy in quantum chemistry and competing with classical algorithms. The localized active space-unitary coupled cluster (LAS-UCC) algorithm iteratively loads a fragment-based multireference wave function onto a quantum computer. In this study, we compare two state preparation methods, quantum phase estimation (QPE) and direct initialization (DI), for each fragment. We test the two state preparation methods on three systems, ranging from a model system, a set of interacting hydrogen molecules, to more realistic chemical problems, like the C-C double bond breaking in transbutadiene and the spin ladder in a bimetallic system. We analyze the impact of QPE parameters, such as the number of ancilla qubits and Trotter steps, on the prepared state. We find a trade-off between the methods, where DI requires fewer resources for smaller fragments, while QPE is more efficient for larger fragments. Our resource estimates highlight the benefits of system fragmentation in state preparation for subsequent quantum chemical calculations. These findings have broad applications for preparing multireference quantum chemical wave functions on quantum circuits that can be used for realistic chemical applications.

AB This study explores Quantum Annealing (QA) versus Classical Computing (CC) approaches in solving the Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem with Time Windows (CVRPTW), using real-world logistics data from Siemens Advanta. By modeling the problem as a Service Network Design (SND) with binary variables and framing CVRPTW within a quantum mechanical paradigm suitable for QA, this approach leverages quantum annealing in a novel manner to tackle the complex optimization challenges inherent in the VRP. Contrasting it with the performance of the traditional branch and cut solver-a specific CC technique-this research unveils the prospective benefits and existing challenges of QA in complex optimization scenarios, thereby emphasizing the need for advancing quantum computing.

TI Application-Oriented Performance Benchmarks for Quantum Computing
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON QUANTUM ENGINEERING
AB In this work, we introduce an open-source suite of quantum application-oriented performance benchmarks that is designed to measure the effectiveness of quantum computing hardware at executing quantum applications. These benchmarks probe a quantum computer's performance on various algorithms and small applications as the problem size is varied, by mapping out the fidelity of the results as a function of circuit width and depth using the framework of volumetric benchmarking. In addition to estimating the fidelity of results generated by quantum execution, the suite is designed to benchmark certain aspects of the execution pipeline in order to provide end users with a practical measure of both the quality of and the time to solution. Our methodology is constructed to anticipate advances in quantum computing hardware that are likely to emerge in the next five years. This benchmarking suite is designed to be readily accessible to a broad audience of users and provides benchmarks that correspond to many well-known quantum computing algorithms.

TI Solid-State Color Centers for Single-Photon Generation
SO PHOTONICS
AB Single-photon sources are important for integrated photonics and quantum technologies, and can be used in quantum key distribution, quantum computing, and sensing. Color centers in the solid state are a promising candidate for the development of the next generation of single-photon sources integrated in quantum photonics devices. They are point defects in a crystal lattice that absorb and emit light at given wavelengths and can emit single photons with high efficiency. The landscape of color centers has changed abruptly in recent years, with the identification of a wider set of color centers and the emergence of new solid-state platforms for room-temperature single-photon generation. This review discusses the emerging material platforms hosting single-photon-emitting color centers, with an emphasis on their potential for the development of integrated optical circuits for quantum photonics.

TI Universal quantum computation using Ising anyons from a non-semisimple
   topological quantum field theory
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB We propose a framework for topological quantum computation using newly discovered non-semisimple analogs of topological quantum field theories in 2 + 1 dimensions. These enhanced theories offer more powerful models for quantum computation. The conventional theory of Ising anyons, which is believed to describe excitations in the nu = 5/2 fractional quantum Hall state, is not universal for quantum computation via braiding of quasiparticles. However, we show that the non-semisimple theory introduces new anyon types that extend the Ising framework. By adding just one new anyon type, universal quantum computation can be achieved through braiding alone. This result opens new avenues for realizing fault-tolerant quantum computing in topologically ordered systems.

TI Accuracy and Potential of Hardware-Efficient Ansatze for Molecular
   Ground and Excited State Electronic Structure Calculations: Benchmark
   and Analysis of High-Depth Quantum Circuits
SO ACS OMEGA
AB The variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) algorithm has positioned quantum chemistry calculation methods as promising applications for noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices. In NISQ devices, where the quantum noise is considerable, it is desirable to have an ansatz for the quantum circuit that is practical to implement and capable of achieving high chemical accuracy. Hardware-efficient Ansatze (HEA), such as the RyRz linear ansatz (RLA) and its modified form that preserves physical quantities-the symmetry preserving ansatz (SPA)-are constructed using quantum gates that can be implemented easily on a quantum computer. However, the extent to which HEA can accurately yield the electronic state energies of actual molecules and the number of quantum gates required to achieve chemical accuracy-which, in practical cases, should be within 1 kcal/mol of the exact energy value-are not well understood. In this study, we aimed to gain a detailed understanding of these aspects by performing noiseless simulations to obtain the ground and low-lying excited state using high-depth HEA quantum circuits for several molecules, including LiH, H2O, BeH2, CH4, and N-2. From the results, we demonstrated that symmetry preserving HEA, such as SPA, can achieve accurate computational results that maintain CCSD-level chemical accuracy by increasing the number of layers. We quantitatively analyze how the expressibility and entangling capability of RLA and SPA quantum circuits evolve with circuit depth. Our results reveal that while increased layers generally expand accessible Hilbert space and entanglement, differences in their limitations highlight the importance of considering physically allowed entanglement for performance of a parametric quantum circuit in VQE. We also studied the potential energy surface of the dissociation of these molecules and found that quantum circuits using SPA can capture static electron correlation, which is challenging to address with classical single-reference quantum chemistry methods such as CCSD. These results from SPA demonstrate its potential to represent electronic states, as it achieves highly accurate results with fewer gate operations compared to physically inspired quantum circuits such as the Unitary Coupled Cluster (UCC) method. This study establishes a possible path for the application of quantum devices in solving quantum chemistry problems.

TI Quantum Private Array Content Comparison Based on Multi-Qubit Swap Test
SO MATHEMATICS
AB Current private comparison schemes primarily focus on comparing single secret integers using quantum technologies, while the area of private array content comparison remains relatively unexplored. To bridge this gap, we introduce a quantum private array content comparison (QPACC) scheme based on multi-qubit swap test. This scheme integrates rotation operation, quantum homomorphic encryption (QHE), and multi-qubit swap test to facilitate the equality comparison of array contents while ensuring their confidentiality. In our approach, participants encode their array elements into the phases of quantum states using rotation operations, which are then encrypted via QHE. These encrypted quantum states are sent to a semi-honest third party (TP) who decrypts the encoded quantum states and computes the modulus squared sum of the inner products of these decoded quantum states using the multi-qubit swap test, thereby determining the equality relationship of the array contents. To verify the feasibility of the proposed scheme, we conduct a case simulation using IBM Qiskit. Security analysis indicates that the proposed scheme is resistant to quantum attacks (including intercept-resend, entangle-measure, and quantum Trojan horse attacks) from outsider eavesdroppers and attempts by curious participants.

TI Effect of data encoding on the expressive power of variational
   quantum-machine-learning models
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Quantum computers can be used for supervised learning by treating parametrized quantum circuits as models that map data inputs to predictions. While a lot of work has been done to investigate the practical implications of this approach, many important theoretical properties of these models remain unknown. Here, we investigate how the strategy with which data are encoded into the model influences the expressive power of parametrized quantum circuits as function approximators. We show that one can naturally write a quantum model as a partial Fourier series in the data, where the accessible frequencies are determined by the nature of the data-encoding gates in the circuit. By repeating simple data-encoding gates multiple times, quantum models can access increasingly rich frequency spectra. We show that there exist quantum models which can realize all possible sets of Fourier coefficients, and therefore, if the accessible frequency spectrum is asymptotically rich enough, such models are universal function approximators.

TI An architecture for two-qubit encoding in neutral ytterbium-171 atoms
SO NPJ QUANTUM INFORMATION
AB We present an architecture for encoding two qubits within the optical "clock" transition and nuclear spin-1/2 degree of freedom of neutral ytterbium-171 atoms. Inspired by recent high-fidelity control of all pairs of states within this four-dimensional quotes space, we present a toolbox for intra-ququart (single-atom) one- and two-qubit gates, inter-ququart (two-atom) Rydberg-based two- and four-qubit gates, and quantum nondemolition (QND) readout. We then use this toolbox to demonstrate the advantages of the ququart encoding for entanglement distillation and quantum error correction which exhibit superior hardware efficiency and better performance in some cases since fewer two-atom operations are required. Finally, leveraging single-state QND readout in our ququart encoding, we present a unique approach to studying interactive circuits and to realizing a symmetry protected topological phase of a spin-1 chain with a shallow, constant-depth circuit.

TI Skyrmion qubits: Challenges for future quantum computing applications
SO APPLIED PHYSICS LETTERS
AB Magnetic nano-skyrmions develop quantized helicity excitations, and the quantum tunneling between nano-skyrmions possessing distinct helicities is indicative of the quantum nature of these particles. Experimental methods capable of nondestructively resolving the quantum aspects of topological spin textures, their local dynamical response, and their functionality now promise practical device architectures for quantum operations. With abilities to measure, engineer, and control matter at the atomic level, nano-skyrmions present opportunities to translate ideas into solid-state technologies. Proof-of-concept devices will offer electrical control over the helicity, opening a promising new pathway toward functionalizing collective spin states for the realization of a quantum computer based on skyrmions. This Perspective aims to discuss developments and challenges in this new research avenue in quantum magnetism and quantum information.

TI Single-shot quantum error correction in intertwined toric codes
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
AB We construct a subsystem code in three dimensions that exhibits single-shot error correction in a user-friendly and transparent way. As this code is a subsystem version of coupled toric codes, we call it the intertwined toric code (ITC). Although previous codes share the property of single-shot error correction, the ITC is distinguished by its physically motivated origin, geometrically straightforward logical operators and errors, and a simple phase diagram. The code arises from three-dimensional (3D) stabilizer toric codes in a way that emphasizes the physical origin of the single-shot property. In particular, starting with two copies of the 3D toric code, we add check operators that provide for the confinement of pointlike excitations without condensing the loop excitations. Geometrically, the bare and dressed logical operators in the ITC derive from logical operators in the underlying toric codes, creating a clear relationship between errors and measurement outcomes. The syndromes of the ITC resemble the syndromes of the single-shot code by Kubica and Vasmer, allowing us to use their decoding schemes. We also extract the phase diagram corresponding to ITC and show that it contains the phases found in the Kubica-Vasmer code. Finally, we suggest various connections to Walker-Wang models and measurementbased quantum computation.

TI Hybrid KEM-QKD Integration With Parameter Optimization for Secure
   Underwater Networks via NetSquid Simulations
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB Quantum cryptography, especially quantum key distribution (QKD), is significant for shielding communications against the dangers of quantum computing by providing information-theoretic security established in quantum mechanics. To securely generate and distribute cryptographic keys between two parties, several quantum safe protocols were proposed. Even though the BB84 protocol is a more trusted, widely implemented and standardized protocol for QKD, it suffers from 50% key loss during sifting. The next version B92 protocol is the lighter version of BB84, has critical issues such as: less tolerance to noise and photon loss and is specifically applicable for short range, lower security scenarios and as B92 has only two non-orthogonal states, it makes it more vulnerable to certain Unambiguous State Discrimination (USD) attacks. Hence, this work has taken the most widely adopted protocol BB84 as it has more advantages for underwater networks by proposing a novel hybrid approach to mitigate the fundamental efficiency challenge of key losses during the sifting phase due to basis mismatches. As this inefficiency is a significant barrier to practical deployment, particularly in resource-constrained environments like underwater networks, we propose a novel hybrid KEM-QKD protocol that eliminates the sifting process of BB84 entirely. Our primary contributions are: (i) integration of a post-quantum key encapsulation mechanism (KEM), CRYSTALS-Kyber, to securely transmit basis information prior to measurement which allows for 100% basis alignment between communicating parties, preserving the entire raw key; (ii) benchmarked our modified protocol against traditional BB84 using NetSquid, a quantum network simulator and (iii) optimized the proposed protocol's parameters using Bayesian Optimization (BO) and Genetic Algorithms (GA). Our results demonstrate two major performance enhancements: (i) a 100% raw key generation rate, a significant improvement over BB84's 50% efficiency and (ii) an increase in the maximum secure distance of up to 42% in existing optic fiber cables, with BO proving superior for parameter optimization. Further, our rigorous experimentation results showcase the potential of the proposed hybrid quantum-classical framework to enhance the practical efficiency of QKD, advancing its viability for robust, high-performance underwater quantum networks.

TI Floating Tunable Coupler for Scalable Quantum Computing Architectures
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW APPLIED
AB We propose a floating tunable coupler that does not rely on direct qubit-qubit coupling capacitances to achieve the zero-coupling condition. We show that the polarity of the qubit-coupler couplings can be engineered to offset the otherwise constant qubit-qubit coupling and attain the zero-coupling condition when the coupler frequency is above or below the qubit frequencies. We experimentally demonstrate these two operating regimes of the tunable coupler by implementing symmetric and asymmetric configurations of the superconducting pads of the coupler with respect to the qubits. Such a floating tunable coupler provides flexibility in designing large-scale quantum processors while reducing the always-on residual couplings.

TI Asymptotically Optimal Prepare-Measure Quantum Key Distribution Protocol
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF THEORETICAL PHYSICS
AB Quantum key distribution (QKD) could be the most significant application of quantum information theory. In nearly four decades, although substantial QKD protocols are developed, the BB84 protocol and its variants are still the most researched ones. It is well-known that the secure bound of qubit error rate (QBER) of BB84 protocol is about 11% while it can be increased to 12.6% by six-state protocol. It would not be surprising that employing more basis could increase the bound. However, what is the optimal protocol, and how to analyze it? In this paper, investigations of asymptotically optimal QKD protocols are proposed. Precisely, We present an abstraction of prepare-measure QKD protocols and investigate two special cases which are optimal among all protocols coding by the same states. Our analysis demonstrates that the asymptotically optimal QBER bounds coding by orthogonal qubits are about 27.28% for both memory C-NOT attacks and memoryless C-NOT attacks while the bounds coding by non-orthogonal states in two mutually unbiased bases are about 22.73% for memory and 28.69% for memoryless C-NOT attacks. The protocols are idealized but might be asymptotically realized while their optimality indicates the ultimate potential of QKD protocols. Although the analysis only contains a special kind of attack, it provides a framework for investigating such protocols.

TI Geometric quantum discord and coherence in a dipolar interacting
   magnetic system
SO PHYSICA SCRIPTA
AB The study of low-dimensional metal complexes has revealed fascinating characteristics regarding the ground-state crossover shown by spin-gaped systems. In this context, this work explores the effect of the quantum-level crossing, induced by the magnetic anisotropies of dipolar interaction, on the quantum discord and coherence of a dinuclear spin-1/2 system. The analytical expressions for the quantum discord, based on Schatten 1-norm, and the l (1) norm quantum coherence for dinuclear spin-1/2 systems, are provided in terms of the magnetic anisotropies. The results show that, while the quantum discord has a clear signature of the quantum level-crossing, the basis dependence of the axial quantum coherence hides the crossover regarding the measured basis. Moreover, global coherence was expressed in terms of the co-latitude and longitude angles of the Bloch sphere representation. Through this result, the average quantum coherence is numerically measured in order to obtain a basis-independent perspective for the l (1) quantum coherence. The results show that the average measurement revealed the signature of the energy-level crossover obtained in the measurement of quantum discord, being wholly stored within the correlations of the system, even in the absence of entanglement.

TI Nonadiabatic Holonomic Quantum Computation via Path Optimization
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW APPLIED
AB Nonadiabatic holonomic quantum computation (NHQC) is implemented by fast evolution processes in a geometric way to withstand local noises. However, recent works of implementing NHQC are sen-sitive to the systematic noise and error. Here, we present a path-optimized NHQC (PONHQC) scheme based on the non-Abelian geometric phase, and find that a geometric gate can be constructed by different evolution paths, which have different responses to systematic noises. Due to the flexibility of the PON-HQC scheme, we can choose an optimized path that can lead to excellent gate performance. Numerical simulation shows that our optimized scheme can greatly outperform the conventional NHQC scheme, in terms of both fidelity and robustness of the gates. In addition, we propose to implement our strategy on superconducting quantum circuits with decoherence-free subspace encoding with the experiment-friendly two-body exchange interaction. Therefore, we present a flexible NHQC scheme that is promising for the future robust quantum computation.

To describe the evolution of various quantum states, we use a Hubbard based model and Lindblad formalism. The suggested optimization algorithm uses the time evolution of entanglement entropy and mutual information for the determination of the system parameters to achieve high fidelity gates.

TI Quantum Artificial Intelligence: Some Strategies and Perspectives
SO AI
AB In the twenty-first century, humanity is compelled to face global challenges. Such challenges involve complex systems. However, science has some cognitive and predictive limits in dealing with complex systems. Some of these limits are related to computational complexity and the recognition of variable patterns. To overcome these limits, artificial intelligence (AI) and quantum computing (QC) appear to be helpful. Even more promising is quantum AI (QAI), which emerged from the combination of AI and QC. The combination of AI and QC produces reciprocal, synergistic effects. This work describes some of these effects. It shows that QC offers new materials for implementing AI and innovative algorithms for solving optimisation problems and enhancing machine learning algorithms. Additionally, it demonstrates how AI algorithms can help overcome many of the experimental challenges associated with implementing QC. It also outlines several perspectives for the future development of quantum artificial intelligence.

TI Shadow process tomography of quantum channels
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Quantum process tomography is a critical capability for building quantum computers, enabling quantum networks, and understanding quantum sensors. Like quantum state tomography, the process tomography of an arbitrary quantum channel requires a number of measurements that scales exponentially in the number of quantum bits affected. However, the recent field of shadow tomography, applied to quantum states, has demonstrated the ability to extract key information about a state with only polynomially many measurements. In this work, we apply the concepts of shadow state tomography to the challenge of characterizing quantum processes. We make use of the Choi isomorphism to directly apply rigorous bounds from shadow state tomography to shadow process tomography, and we find additional bounds on the number of measurements that are unique to process tomography. Our results, which include algorithms for implementing shadow process tomography, enable new techniques including evaluation of channel concatenation and the application of channels to shadows of quantum states. This provides a dramatic improvement for understanding large-scale quantum systems.

TI Millimeter-Wave Superconducting Qubit
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB Manipulating the electromagnetic spectrum at the single-photon level is fundamental for quantum experiments. In the visible and infrared ranges, this can be accomplished with atomic quantum emitters, and with superconducting qubits such control is extended to the microwave range (below 10 GHz). Meanwhile, the region between these two energy ranges presents an unexplored opportunity for innovation. We bridge this gap by scaling up a superconducting qubit to the millimeter-wave range (near 100 GHz). Working in this energy range greatly reduces sensitivity to thermal noise compared to microwave devices, enabling operation at significantly higher temperatures, up to 1 K. This has many advantages by removing the dependence on rare 3He for refrigeration, simplifying cryogenic systems, and providing orders-of-magnitude higher cooling power, lending the flexibility needed for novel quantum sensing and hybrid experiments. Using low-loss niobium trilayer junctions, we realize a qubit at 72 GHz cooled to 0.87 K using only 4He. We perform Rabi oscillations to establish control over the qubit state, and measure relaxation and dephasing times of 15.8 and 17.4 ns, respectively. This demonstration of a millimeter-wave quantum emitter offers exciting prospects for enhanced sensitivity thresholds in high-frequency photon detection, provides new options for quantum transduction and for scaling up and speeding up quantum computing, enables integration of quantum systems where 3He refrigeration units are impractical, and, importantly, paves the way for quantum experiments exploring a novel energy range.

TI Robust Hamiltonian Engineering for Interacting Qudit Systems
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW X
AB Dynamical decoupling and Hamiltonian engineering are well-established techniques that have been used to control qubit systems. However, designing the corresponding methods for qudit systems has been challenging due to the lack of a Bloch sphere representation, more complex interactions, and additional control constraints. By identifying several general structures associated with such problems, we develop a formalism for the robust dynamical decoupling and Hamiltonian engineering of strongly interacting qudit systems. Our formalism significantly simplifies qudit pulse-sequence design while naturally incorporating robustness conditions necessary for experimental practicality. We experimentally demonstrate these techniques in a strongly interacting, disordered ensemble of spin-1 nitrogen-vacancy centers, achieving more than an order-of-magnitude improvement in coherence time over existing pulse sequences. We further describe how our techniques enable the engineering of exotic many-body phenomena such as quantum many-body scars, and open up new opportunities for quantum metrology with enhanced sensitivities. These results enable wide-reaching new applications for dynamical decoupling and Hamiltonian engineering in many-body physics and quantum metrology.

TI An improved QFT-based quantum comparator and extended modular arithmetic
   using one ancilla qubit
SO NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB Quantum comparators and modular arithmetic are fundamental in many quantum algorithms. Current research mainly focuses on operations between two quantum states. However, various applications, such as integer factorization, optimization, and financial risk analysis, commonly require one of the inputs to be classical. It requires many ancillary qubits, especially when subsequent computations are involved. In this paper, we propose a quantum-classical comparator based on the quantum Fourier transform. Then we extend it to compare two quantum integers and modular arithmetic. Proposed operators only require up to one ancilla qubit, which is optimal for qubit resources. We analyze limitations in the current modular addition circuit and develop it to process arbitrary quantum states in the entire n-qubit space. The proposed algorithms reduce computing resources and make them valuable for noisy intermediate-scale quantum computers.

Our approach employs circuit partitioning for scalability with procedures to 1) reduce circuit length using approximate synthesis, 2) improve fidelity by running circuits that represent key samples in the approximation space, and 3) reason about approximation upper bound. Our evaluation results indicate that our approach of ldissimilarz approximations provides close fidelity to the original circuit. Overall, the results indicate that Quest can reduce CNOT gate count by 30-80% on ideal systems and decrease the impact of noise on existing and near-future quantum systems.

TI Quantum Architecture Search with Meta-Learning
SO ADVANCED QUANTUM TECHNOLOGIES
AB Variational quantum algorithms (VQAs) have been successfully applied to quantum approximate optimization algorithms, variational quantum compiling and quantum machine learning models. The performances of VQAs largely depend on the architecture of parameterized quantum circuits (PQCs). Quantum architecture search (QAS) aims to automate the design of PQCs in different VQAs with classical optimization algorithms. However, current QAS algorithms do not use prior experiences and search the quantum architecture from scratch for each new task, which is inefficient and time consuming. In this paper, a meta quantum architecture search (MetaQAS) algorithm is proposed, which learns good initialization heuristics of the architecture (i.e., meta-architecture), along with the meta-parameters of quantum gates from a number of training tasks such that they can adapt to new tasks with fewer gradient updates, which leads to fast learning on new tasks. The proposed MetaQAS can be used with arbitrary gradient-based QAS algorithms. Simulation results on variational quantum compiling (VQC) and quantum approximate optimization algorithm (QAOA) show that the architectures optimized by MetaQAS converge faster than a state-of-the-art gradient-based QAS algorithm, namely DQAS. MetaQAS also achieves a better solution than DQAS after fine-tuning of gate parameters.

TI Finite key performance of satellite quantum key distribution under
   practical constraints
SO COMMUNICATIONS PHYSICS
AB Finite key analysis is the gold standard in evaluating the performance of satellite-based quantum key distribution (SatQKD) but implementing a fully optimised parameter space is challenging. The authors present practical performance limits to SatQKD that account for engineering limitations and mission design trade-offs, providing valuable insight for the next generation of satellite-based missions.
   Global-scale quantum communication networks will require efficient long-distance distribution of quantum signals. While optical fibre communications are range-limited due to exponential losses in the absence of quantum memories and repeaters, satellites enable intercontinental quantum communications. However, the design of satellite quantum key distribution (SatQKD) systems has unique challenges over terrestrial networks. The typical approach to modelling SatQKD has been to estimate performances with a fully optimised protocol parameter space and with few payload and platform resource limitations. Here, we analyse how practical constraints affect the performance of SatQKD for the Bennett-Brassard 1984 (BB84) weak coherent pulse decoy state protocol with finite key size effects. We consider engineering limitations and trade-offs in mission design including limited in-orbit tunability, quantum random number generation rates and storage, and source intensity uncertainty. We quantify practical SatQKD performance limits to determine the long-term key generation capacity and provide performance benchmarks to support the design of upcoming missions.

TI Quantifying fermionic nonlinearity of quantum circuits
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Variational quantum algorithms (VQAs) have been proposed as one of the most promising approaches to demonstrate quantum advantage on noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices. However, it has been unclear whether VQAs can maintain quantum advantage under the intrinsic noise of the NISQ devices, which deteriorates the quantumness. Here we propose a measure, called fermionic nonlinearity, to quantify the classical simulatability of quantum circuits designed for simulating fermionic Hamiltonians. Specifically, we construct a Monte Carlo type classical algorithm based on the classical simulatability of fermionic linear optics, whose sampling overhead is characterized by the fermionic nonlinearity. As a demonstration of these techniques, we calculate the upper bound of the fermionic nonlinearity of a rotation gate generated by four fermionic modes under the dephasing noise. Moreover, we estimate the sampling costs of the unitary coupled cluster singles and doubles quantum circuits for hydrogen chains subject to the dephasing noise. We find that, depending on the error probability and atomic spacing, there are regions where the fermionic nonlinearity becomes very small or unity, and hence the circuits are classically simulatable. We believe that our method and results help to design quantum circuits for fermionic systems with potential quantum advantages.

TI Strong coupling of a superconducting flux qubit to single bismuth donors
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB The realization of a quantum computer represents a tremendous scientific and technological challenge due to the extreme fragility of quantum information. The physical support of information, namely the quantum bit or qubit, must at the same time be strongly coupled to other qubits by gates to compute information, and well decoupled from its environment to keep its quantum behavior. An interesting physical system for realizing such qubits are magnetic impurities in semiconductors, such as bismuth donors in silicon. Indeed, spins associated to bismuth donors can reach an extremely long coherence time - of the order of seconds. Yet it is extremely difficult to establish and control efficient gates between these spins. Here we demonstrate a protocol where single bismuth donors can coherently transfer their quantum information to a superconducting flux qubit, which acts as a mediator or quantum bus. This superconducting device allows to connect distant spins on-demand with little impact on their coherent behavior.

TI Transforming Neural Networks into Quantum-Cognitive Models: A Research
   Tutorial with Novel Applications
SO TECHNOLOGIES
AB Quantum technologies are increasingly pervasive, underpinning the operation of numerous electronic, optical and medical devices. Today, we are also witnessing rapid advancements in quantum computing and communication. However, access to quantum technologies in computation remains largely limited to professionals in research organisations and high-tech industries. This paper demonstrates how traditional neural networks can be transformed into neuromorphic quantum models, enabling anyone with a basic understanding of undergraduate-level machine learning to create quantum-inspired models that mimic the functioning of the human brain-all using a standard laptop. We present several examples of these quantum machine learning transformations and explore their potential applications, aiming to make quantum technology more accessible and practical for broader use. The examples discussed in this paper include quantum-inspired analogues of feedforward neural networks, recurrent neural networks, Echo State Network reservoir computing, and Bayesian neural networks, demonstrating that a quantum approach can both optimise the training process and equip the models with certain human-like cognitive characteristics.

TI qRobot: A Quantum Computing Approach in Mobile Robot Order Picking and
   Batching Problem Solver Optimization
SO ALGORITHMS
AB This article aims to bring quantum computing to robotics. A quantum algorithm is developed to minimize the distance traveled in warehouses and distribution centers where order picking is applied. For this, a proof of concept is proposed through a Raspberry Pi 4, generating a quantum combinatorial optimization algorithm that saves the distance travelled and the batch of orders to be made. In case of computational need, the robot will be able to parallelize part of the operations in hybrid computing (quantum + classical), accessing CPUs and QPUs distributed in a public or private cloud. We developed a stable environment (ARM64) inside the robot (Raspberry) to run gradient operations and other quantum algorithms on IBMQ, Amazon Braket (D-Wave), and Pennylane locally or remotely. The proof of concept, when run in the above stated quantum environments, showed the execution time of our algorithm with different public access simulators on the market, computational results of our picking and batching algorithm, and analyze the quantum real-time execution. Our findings are that the behavior of the Amazon Braket D-Wave is better than Gate-based Quantum Computing over 20 qubits, and that AWS-Braket has better time performance than Qiskit or Pennylane.

TI Integrated semi-quantum layered communication
SO IET QUANTUM COMMUNICATION
AB In recent times, secure quantum communication in layered networks has emerged as an important area of study. The authors harness the potential offered by multidimensional states in secure quantum communication with only one quantum participant and all the other classical participants. Three protocols are proposed for-(i) entanglement-based layered semi-quantum key distribution, (ii) layered semi-quantum secret sharing, and (iii) integrated layered semi-quantum key distribution and secret sharing to share secret information in arbitrarily layered networks. These protocols integrate the features of semi-quantum communication in layered networks. All three protocols allow for simultaneous distribution of secure information in all the layers of a network, thanks to the employment of multidimensional states. These protocols are presented for a small network of at most five participants and three layers and show the robustness of the same against various eavesdropping strategies. Finally, a detailed procedure is provided for generalisations of the proposed protocols to distribute keys/secrets in any arbitrarily structured quantum network.

TI Symmetry-invariant quantum machine learning force fields
SO NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB Machine learning techniques are essential tools to compute efficient, yet accurate, force fields for atomistic simulations. This approach has recently been extended to incorporate quantum computational methods, making use of variational quantum learning models to predict potential energy surfaces and atomic forces from ab initio training data. However, the trainability and scalability of such models are still limited, due to both theoretical and practical barriers. Inspired by recent developments in geometric classical and quantum machine learning, here we design quantum neural networks that explicitly incorporate, as a data-inspired prior, an extensive set of physically relevant symmetries. We find that our invariant quantum learning models outperform their more generic counterparts on individual molecules of growing complexity. Furthermore, we study a water dimer as a minimal example of a system with multiple components, showcasing the versatility of our proposed approach and opening the way towards larger simulations. Finally, we perform a barren plateau analysis and numerically observe that our model does not exhibit a barren plateau in the shallow depth regime. Our results suggest that molecular force fields generation can significantly profit from leveraging the framework of geometric quantum machine learning, and that chemical systems represent, in fact, an interesting and rich playground for the development and application of advanced quantum machine learning tools.

TI Designing quantum annealing schedules using Bayesian optimization
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH

We showcase our scheme with results for two paradigmatic spin models. We find that Bayesian optimization is able to identify schedules resulting in fidelities several orders of magnitude better than standard protocols for both quantum and reverse annealing, as applied to the p-spin model. We also show that our scheme can help improve the design of hybrid quantum algorithms for hard combinatorial optimization problems, such as the maximum independent set problem, and illustrate these results via experiments on a neutral-atom quantum processor available on Amazon Braket.

TI Anti-PT-symmetric qubit: Decoherence and entanglement entropy
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB We investigate the dynamics of a general two-level based anti-parity-time (anti-PT)-symmetric qubit and study its decoherence as well as entanglement entropy properties. We compare our findings with that of the corresponding parity-time (PT)-symmetric and Hermitian qubits. To begin, we consider the time-dependent Dyson map to find the exact analytical dynamics for a general non-Hermitian qubit system weakly coupled with a thermal bath for pure dephasing, before specializing it to the case of a general anti-PT-symmetric qubit. Basing the comparison under the same coupling strength or increasing the non-Hermiticity, we observe that the decoherence function and entanglement entropy of the anti-PT-symmetric qubit decays and grows more slowly, respectively, compared to the PT-symmetric and Hermitian qubits. Similarly, the corresponding variance and area of Fisher information are much higher compared to the PT-symmetric and Hermitian qubits. These results demonstrate that anti-PT-symmetric qubits may be better suited for quantum computing and quantum information processing applications than conventional Hermitian or even PT-symmetric qubits.

TI Generation of microwave-phonon and states
SO ACTA PHYSICA SINICA
AB Quantum entanglement is a key resource for performing quantum computing and building quantum communication networks. By injecting a microwave-optical dual-mode entanglement field into the system, as well as pumping the optical and microwave cavities, and by appropriately choosing the detuning relationship between the pumping field and the modes, it is shown in this work that microwave-phonon entanglement E-ab and magnon-optics entanglement E-cm can be generated simultaneously in the cavity opto-magnomechanic system, and the entanglement can be in a steady state. Specifically, the model is based on a hybrid quantum system of magnons, where a microwave-light entanglement generated by an optically pulsed superconducting electro-optical device through spontaneous parametric down-conversion process is injected as the intracavity field, and a blue-detuned microwave field is used to excite the magnon modes to produce magnon-phonon entanglement. Through the interaction between an optomechanical beam splitter and microwave-magnon state- swap, steady microwave-phonon entanglement E-ab and magnon-optics entanglement E-cm are successfully realized. The entanglement E-ab and E-cm in the system are analyzed using the logarithmic negativity. The effects of several parameters of the system, such as environment temperature, coupling strength and dissipation rate, on the degree of entanglement are investigated. In particular, the entanglement E-ab and E-cm generated in this system can exist both simultaneously and individually. Especially when g(am) = 0, the entanglement E-ab and E-cm still exist. Moreover, directly injecting entangled microwave-light into the system can significantly enhance the robustness of the entanglement against temperature, which will have broad application prospects in quantum information processing in quantum networks and hybrid quantum systems. Notably, the entanglement E-ab and E-cm exist even at a temperature of 1.3 K. Our research has potential value for applications in the fields of quantum information processing and quantum networks.

SO MATERIALS FOR QUANTUM TECHNOLOGY
AB Silicon has been a core material for digital computing owing to its high mobility, stability oxide interface, mature manufacturing technologies for more than half a century. While Moore's law seems to further advance via various technologies to extend its expiration date, some intractable problems that requires processing times growing exponentially cannot be solved in a reasonable scale of time. Meanwhile, quantum computing is a promising tool to perform calculations much more efficiently than classical computing for certain types of problems. To realize a practical quantum computer, quantum dots on group-IV semiconductor heterostructures are promising due to the long decoherence time, scalability, and compatibility with the Si very-large-scale integrated technology. In this review, we start with the advancement of group-IV undoped heterostructures since 2000 and review carrier transport properties in these undoped heterostructure. We also review the hole effective masses, spin-orbit coupling, and effective g-factors in the Ge-based heterostructures and conclude with a brief summary.

TI A Survey of Quantum Entanglement Routing Protocols-Challenges for
   Wide-Area Networks
SO ADVANCED QUANTUM TECHNOLOGIES
AB In this paper, the key challenges (loss due to distance, entanglement routing, multi-commodities) for the coming quantum internet, relying on entanglement of quantum bits (for short, qubits) on top of an existing network, are analyzed. A unifying framework enabling to compare the various entanglement distribution, purification, and routing protocols published so far is presented. With regard to entanglement routing, the introduction of different time windows will be essential in order to cope efficiently with the main challenges like complex route calculation and fidelity estimation on the one hand, actual entanglement route selection and entangled photon generation on the other hand. For a roll-out on top of existing transmission networks, all the research publications for the last 20 years start to cover pretty well the global scheme. Nevertheless, open questions remain, like the actual advantage of some task execution prior to the online quantum path selection, or the design of algorithms approximating the multi-commodities flow optimization problem, or the issue of dealing with a processing time not much longer than the qubit life time.

Furthermore, TDAG improves compared to a faster partitioning method called QuickPartitioner by 38% in terms of quality of the results with minimal overhead in execution time.

It is a hybrid quantum-classical approach that minimizes an associated cost function in order to train a parameterized ansatz. In this paper we adapt the qualitative loss landscape characterization for neural networks introduced in Goodfellow et al. (2014); Li et al. (2017) and tests for connectivity used in Draxler et al. (2018) to study the loss landscape features in PQC training. We present results for PQCs trained on a simple regression task, using the bilayer circuit ansatz, which consists of alternating layers of parameterized rotation gates and entangling gates. Multiple circuits are trained with 3 different batch gradient optimizers: stochastic gradient descent, the quantum natural gradient, and Adam. We identify large features in the landscape that can lead to faster convergence in training workflows.

TI Deterministic measurement of a Rydberg superatom qubit via
   cavity-enhanced single-photon emission
SO OPTICA
AB With Rydberg dipole interactions, a mesoscopic atomic ensemble becomes a superatom that behaves like a single atom but couples collectively with photons. It is potentially a strong candidate as a qubit in quantum information science, especially for quantum networks. In this paper, we report a cavity-enhanced single-photon interface for a Rydberg superatom and demonstrate deterministic qubit readout via a photon burst. We make use of a low-finesse ring cavity to enhance the atom-photon interaction and obtain in-fiber single-photon generation efficiency of 44%. Harnessing the dipole interaction between two Rydberg levels, we may create either a sequence of multiple single photons or nothing, conditioned on an initial qubit state. We achieve a measurement fidelity of 93.0% in 4.8 mu s. Our work complements the experimental toolbox of harnessing Rydberg superatoms for quantum information applications.

AB In this work, we propose a framework in the form of a Python package, specifically designed for the analysis of Quantum Machine Learning models. This framework is based on the PennyLane simulator and facilitates the evaluation and training of Variational Quantum Circuits. It provides additional functionality ranging from the ability to add different types of noise to the classical simulation, over different parameter initialisation strategies, to the calculation of expressibility and entanglement for a given model. As an intrinsic property of Quantum Fourier Models, it provides two methods for calculating the corresponding Fourier spectrum: one via the Fast Fourier Transform and another analytical method based on the expansion of the expectation value using trigonometric polynomials. It also provides a set of predefined approaches that allow a fast and straightforward implementation of Quantum Machine Learning models. With this framework, we extend the PennyLane simulator with a set of tools that allow researchers a more convenient start with Quantum Fourier Models and aim to unify the analysis of Variational Quantum Circuits.

TI Variational quantum algorithm for estimating the quantum Fisher
   information
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB The quantum Fisher information (QFI) quantifies the ultimate precision of estimating a parameter from a quantum state and can be regarded as a reliability measure of a quantum system as a quantum sensor. However, estimation of the QFI for a mixed state is in general a computationally demanding task. In this paper we present a variational quantum algorithm called variational quantum Fisher information estimation (VQFIE) to address this task. By estimating lower and upper bounds on the QFI, based on bounding the fidelity, VQFIE outputs a range in which the actual QFI lies. This result can then be used to variationally prepare the state that maximizes the QFI, for the application of quantum sensing. In contrast to previous approaches, VQFIE does not require knowledge of the explicit form of the sensor dynamics. We simulate the algorithm for a magnetometry setup and demonstrate the tightening of our bounds as the state purity increases. For this example, we compare our bounds with literature bounds and show that our bounds are tighter.

TI Quantum next generation reservoir computing: an efficient quantum
   algorithm for forecasting quantum dynamics
SO QUANTUM MACHINE INTELLIGENCE
AB Next Generation Reservoir Computing (NG-RC) is a modern class of model-free machine learning that enables an accurate forecasting of time series data generated by dynamical systems. We demonstrate that NG-RC can accurately predict full many-body quantum dynamics in both integrable and chaotic systems. This is in contrast to the conventional application of reservoir computing that concentrates on the prediction of the dynamics of observables. In addition, we apply a technique which we refer to as skipping ahead to predict far future states accurately without the need to extract information about the intermediate states. However, adopting a classical NG-RC for many-body quantum dynamics prediction is computationally prohibitive due to the large Hilbert space of sample input data. In this work, we propose an end-to-end quantum algorithm for many-body quantum dynamics forecasting with a quantum computational speedup via the block-encoding technique. This proposal presents an efficient model-free quantum scheme to forecast quantum dynamics coherently, bypassing inductive biases incurred in a model-based approach.

TI Maximally entangled real states and SLOCC invariants: the 3-qutrit case

AB The absolute values of polynomial SLOCC invariants (which always vanish on separable states) can be seen as entanglement measures. We study the case of real 3-qutrit systems and discover a new set of maximally entangled states (from the point of view of maximizing the hyperdeterminant). We also study the basic fundamental invariants and find real 3-qutrit states that maximize their absolute values. It is notable that the Aharonov state is a simultaneous maximizer for all three fundamental invariants. We also study the evaluation of these invariants on random real 3-qutrit systems and analyze their behavior using histograms and level-set plots. Finally, we show how to evaluate these invariants on any 3-qutrit state using basic matrix operations.

TI Equation-of-Motion Theory to Calculate Accurate Band Structures with a
   Quantum Computer
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY LETTERS
AB Band structure is a cornerstone to understand the electronic properties of materials. Accurate band structure calculations using a high-level quantum chemistry theory can be computationally very expensive. It is promising to speed up such calculations with a quantum computer. In this study, we present a quantum algorithm for band structure calculations based on the equation-of-motion (EOM) theory. First, we introduce a new variational quantum eigensolver algorithm named ADAPT-C for ground-state quantum simulation of solids, where the wave function is built adaptively from a complete set of anti-Hermitian operators. Then, on top of the ADAPT-C ground state, quasiparticle energies and the band structure can be calculated using the EOM theory in a quantum-subspace-expansion style, where the projected excitation operators guarantee that the killer condition is satisfied. As a proof of principle, such an EOM-ADAPT-C protocol is used to calculate the band structures of silicon and diamond using a quantum computer simulator.

TI Quantum Key Distribution Secured Optical Networks: A Survey
SO IEEE OPEN JOURNAL OF THE COMMUNICATIONS SOCIETY
AB Increasing incidents of cyber attacks and evolution of quantum computing poses challenges to secure existing information and communication technologies infrastructure. In recent years, quantum key distribution (QKD) is being extensively researched, and is widely accepted as a promising technology to realize secure networks. Optical fiber networks carry a huge amount of information, and are widely deployed around the world in the backbone terrestrial, submarine, metro, and access networks. Thus, instead of using separate dark fibers for quantum communication, integration of QKD with the existing classical optical networks has been proposed as a cost-efficient solution, however, this integration introduces new research challenges. In this paper, we do a comprehensive survey of the state-of-the-art QKD secured optical networks, which is going to shape communication networks in the coming decades. We elucidate the methods and protocols used in QKD secured optical networks, and describe the process of key establishment. Various methods proposed in the literature to address the networking challenges in QKD secured optical networks, specifically, routing, wavelength and time-slot allocation (RWTA), resiliency, trusted repeater node (TRN) placement, QKD for multicast service, and quantum key recycling are described and compared in detail. This survey begins with the introduction to QKD and its advantages over conventional encryption methods. Thereafter, an overview of QKD is given including quantum bits, basic QKD system, QKD schemes and protocol families along with the detailed description of QKD process based on the Bennett and Brassard-84 (BB84) protocol as it is the most widely used QKD protocol in the literature. QKD system are also prone to some specific types of attacks, hence, we describe the types of quantum hacking attacks on the QKD system along with the methods used to prevent them. Subsequently, the process of point-to-point mechanism of QKD over an optical fiber link is described in detail using the BB84 protocol. Different architectures of QKD secured optical networks are described next. Finally, major findings from this comprehensive survey are summarized with highlighting open issues and challenges in QKD secured optical networks.

TI S-QGPU: Shared quantum gate processing unit for distributed quantum
   computing
SO AVS QUANTUM SCIENCE
AB We propose a distributed quantum computing (DQC) architecture in which individual small-sized quantum computers are connected to a shared quantum gate processing unit (S-QGPU). The S-QGPU comprises a collection of hybrid two-qubit gate modules for remote gate operations. In contrast to conventional DQC systems, where each quantum computer is equipped with dedicated communication qubits, S-QGPU effectively pools the resources (e.g., the communication qubits) together for remote gate operations, and, thus, significantly reduces the cost of not only the local quantum computers but also the overall distributed system. Our preliminary analysis and simulation show that S-QGPU's shared resources for remote gate operations enable efficient resource utilization. When not all computing qubits (also called data qubits) in the system require simultaneous remote gate operations, S-QGPU-based DQC architecture demands fewer communication qubits, further decreasing the overall cost. Alternatively, with the same number of communication qubits, it can support a larger number of simultaneous remote gate operations more efficiently, especially when these operations occur in a burst mode.

TI Hacking the Least Trusted Node: Indirect Eavesdropping in Quantum
   Networks
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB We study the significance of the common trusted relay assumption in quantum networks. While most practical implementations of quantum networks rely on trusted devices, the question of security without this assumption has been rarely addressed. Device independent security attempts to minimize the assumptions made on the quantum hardware, entanglement based methods try to avoid relays to the extent possible, and multipath transmission improves robustness and security by enforcing the attacker to conquer more than just a single intermediate node. Common to all these past studies is their focus on the physical layer and direct connections. We describe an attack from the networking and routing layer. Assuming at least one node that is not perfectly tamper-proof, meaning that an attacker has established a foothold to read traffic from the inside, we show how to exploit the eavesdropping detection mechanisms of the quantum key distribution (QKD) devices to cause traffic redirection over the vulnerable node, thus defeating security under the trusted node assumption. We experimentally demonstrate how the attack works on networks of different size and topology, and thereby further substantiate the significance of the trust assumptions for end-to-end security of QKD networks.

AB Background: Quantum computing is a rapidly growing new programming paradigm that brings significant changes to the design and implementation of algorithms. Understanding quantum algorithms requires knowledge of physics and mathematics, which can be challenging for software developers. Aims: In this work, we provide a first analysis of how LLMs can support developers' understanding of quantum code. Method: We empirically analyse and compare the quality of explanations provided by three widely adopted LLMs (Gpt3.5, Llama2, and Tinyllama) using two different human-written prompt styles for seven state-of-the-art quantum algorithms. We also analyse how consistent LLM explanations are over multiple rounds and how LLMs can improve existing descriptions of quantum algorithms. Results: Llama2 provides the highest quality explanations from scratch, while Gpt3.5 emerged as the LLM best suited to improve existing explanations. In addition, we show that adding a small amount of context to the prompt significantly improves the quality of explanations. Finally, we observe how explanations are qualitatively and syntactically consistent over multiple rounds. Conclusions: This work highlights promising results, and opens challenges for future research in the field of LLMs for quantum code explanation. Future work includes refining the methods through prompt optimisation and parsing of quantum code explanations, as well as carrying out a systematic assessment of the quality of explanations.

TI Exploring Quantum contextuality with the quantum Möbius-Escher-Penrose
   hypergraph
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB This paper presents the quantum M & ouml;bius-Escher-Penrose hypergraph, drawing inspiration from paradoxical constructs such as the M & ouml;bius strip and Penrose's "impossible objects." The hypergraph is constructed using faithful orthogonal representations in Hilbert space, thereby embedding the graph within a quantum framework. Additionally, a quasiclassical realization is achieved through two-valued states and partition logic, leading to an embedding within a Boolean algebra. This dual representation delineates the distinctions between classical and quantum embeddings, with a particular focus on contextuality, highlighted by violations of exclusivity and completeness, quantified through classical and quantum probabilities. The paper also examines violations of Boole's conditions of possible experience using correlation polytopes, underscoring the inherent contextuality of the hypergraph. These results offer deeper insights into quantum contextuality and its intricate relationship with classical logic structures.

TI Vulnerability of fault-tolerant topological quantum error correction to
   quantum deviations in code space
SO PNAS NEXUS
AB Quantum computers face significant challenges from quantum deviations or coherent noise, particularly during gate operations, which pose a complex threat to the efficacy of quantum error correction (QEC) protocols. Here we scrutinize the performance of the topological toric code in 2D under the dual influence of stochastic noise and quantum deviations, especially during the critical phases of initial state preparation and error detection facilitated by multiqubit entanglement gates. By mapping the multiround error detection protocol-from the inception of an imperfectly prepared code state via imperfect stabilizer measurements-to a statistical mechanical model (3D Z2 gauge theory coupled with 2D Z2 gauge theory), we establish a link between the error threshold and the model's phase transition. Specifically, we find two distinct error thresholds that demarcate varying efficacies in QEC. The empirical threshold that signifies the operational success of QEC aligns with the theoretical ideal of flawless state preparation operations. Contrarily, below another finite theoretical threshold, a phenomenon absent in purely stochastic error models emerges: unidentifiable measurement errors precipitate QEC failure in scenarios with large code distances. For codes of finite distance d, it is revealed that maintaining the preparation error rate beneath a crossover scale, proportional to 1/logd, allows for the suppression of logical errors. Considering that fault-tolerant quantum computation is valuable only in systems with large scale and exceptionally low logical error rates, this investigation explicitly demonstrates the serious vulnerability of fault tolerant QEC based on 2D toric codes to quantum deviations in code space, highlighting the imperative to address inherent preparation noise.

TI Quantum simulation of Z2 lattice gauge theory with minimal
   resources
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW D
AB The quantum simulation of fermionic gauge field theories is one of the anticipated uses of quantum computers in the noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) era. Recently work has been done to simulate properties of the fermionic Z(2) gauge field theory in (1 + 1)D and the pure gauge theory in (2 + 1)D. In this work, we investigate various options for simulating the fermionic Z(2) gauge field theory in (2 + 1)D. To simulate the theory on a NISQ device it is vital to minimize both the number of qubits used and the circuit depth. In this work we propose ways to optimize both criteria for simulating time dynamics. In particular, we develop a new way to simulate this theory on a quantum computer, with minimal qubit requirements. We provide a quantum circuit for simulating a single first-order Trotter step that minimizes the number of 2-qubit gates needed and gives comparable results to methods requiring more qubits. Furthermore, we investigate variational Trotterization approaches that allow us to further decrease the circuit depth.

TI Continuous entanglement distribution over a transnational 248 km fiber
   link
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Reliable long-distance distribution of entanglement is a key technique for many quantum applications, most notably quantum key distribution. Here, we present a continuously working, trusted-node free international link between Austria and Slovakia, directly distributing polarization-entangled photon pairs via 248 km of deployed telecommunication fiber. Despite 79 dB loss, we observe stable detected pair rates of 9 s(-1) over 110 h. We mitigate multi-pair detections with strict temporal filtering, enabled by nonlocal compensation of chromatic dispersion and superconducting nanowire detectors. Fully automatized active polarization stabilization keeps the entangled state's visibility at 86% for altogether 82 h. In a quantum cryptography context, this corresponds to an asymptotic secure key rate of 1.4 bits/s and 258 kbit of total key, considering finite-key effects. Our work paves the way for low-maintenance, ultra-stable quantum communication over long distances, independent of weather conditions and time of day, thus constituting an important step towards the quantum internet.

TI Decoherence in exchange-coupled quantum spin-qubit systems: Impact of
   multiqubit interactions and geometric connectivity
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB We investigate the impact of different connectivities on the decoherence time in quantum systems under quasistatic Heisenberg noise. We considered three types of elementary units, including node, stick and triangle and connect them into ring, chain, and tree configurations. We find that rings exhibit greater stability compared with chains, contrary to the expectation that higher average connectivity leads to decreased stability. Additionally, the stick configuration is more stable than the triangle configuration. We also observe similar trends in entanglement entropy and return probability, indicating their potential use in characterizing decoherence time. Our findings provide insights into the interplay between connectivity and stability in quantum systems, with implications for the design of robust quantum technologies and quantum error correction strategies.

TI Fast Quantum Gates for Exchange-Only Qubits Using Simultaneous Exchange
   Pulses
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB The benefit of exchange-only qubits compared to other spin-qubit types is the universal control using only voltage-controlled exchange interactions between neighboring spins. As a compromise, qubit operations have to be constructed from nonorthogonal rotation axes of the Bloch sphere and result in rather long pulsing sequences. This paper aims to develop a faster implementation of single-qubit gates using simultaneous exchange pulses and manifests their potential for the construction of two-qubit gates. We introduce pulse sequences in which single-qubit gates could be executed faster and show that subsequences on three spins in two-qubit gates could be implemented in fewer steps. Our findings can particularly speed up gate sequences for realistic idle times between sequential pulses and we show that this advantage increases with more interconnectivity of the quantum dots. We further demonstrate how a phase operation can introduce a relative phase between the computational and some of the leakage states, which can be advantageous for the construction of two-qubit gates. In addition to our theoretical analysis, we experimentally demonstrate and characterize a simultaneous exchange implementation of X rotations in a SiGe quantum dot device and compare to the state of the art with sequential exchange pulses.

TI Review on entropic uncertainty relations
SO ACTA PHYSICA SINICA
AB The Heisenberg uncertainty principle is one of the characteristics of quantum mechanics. With the vigorousdevelopment of quantum information theory, uncertain relations have gradually played an important role in it.In particular, in order to solved the shortcomings of the concept in the initial formulation of the uncertaintyprinciple, we brought entropy into the uncertainty relation, after that, the entropic uncertainty relation hasexploited the advantages to the full in various applications. As we all know the entropic uncertainty relationhas became the core element of the security analysis of almost all quantum cryptographic protocols. This reviewmainly introduces development history and latest progress of uncertain relations. After Heisenberg's argumentthat incompatible measurement results are impossible to predict, many scholars, inspired by this viewpoint,have made further relevant investigations. They combined the quantum correlation between the observableobject and its environment, and carried out various generalizations of the uncertainty relation to obtain moregeneral formulas. In addition, it also focuses on the entropy uncertainty relationship and quantum-memory-assisted entropic uncertainty relation, and the dynamic characteristics of uncertainty in some physical systems.Finally, various applications of the entropy uncertainty relationship in the field of quantum information arediscussed, from randomnesss to wave-particle duality to quantum key distribution.

TI Erasure conversion for fault-tolerant quantum computing in alkaline
   earth Rydberg atom arrays
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Executing quantum algorithms on error-corrected logical qubits is a critical step for scalable quantum computing, but the requisite numbers of qubits and physical error rates are demanding for current experimental hardware. Recently, the development of error correcting codes tailored to particular physical noise models has helped relax these requirements. In this work, we propose a qubit encoding and gate protocol for Yb-171 neutral atom qubits that converts the dominant physical errors into erasures, that is, errors in known locations. The key idea is to encode qubits in a metastable electronic level, such that gate errors predominantly result in transitions to disjoint subspaces whose populations can be continuously monitored via fluorescence. We estimate that 98% of errors can be converted into erasures. We quantify the benefit of this approach via circuit-level simulations of the surface code, finding a threshold increase from 0.937% to 4.15%. We also observe a larger code distance near the threshold, leading to a faster decrease in the logical error rate for the same number of physical qubits, which is important for near-term implementations. Erasure conversion should benefit any error correcting code, and may also be applied to design new gates and encodings in other qubit platforms.
   In quantum computing, realistic error models can allow tailored correction schemes for specific platforms. Here, while considering the case of qubits encoded in metastable electronic levels of atomic arrays, the authors propose a way to convert a large fraction of occurring errors into detectable leakages, or erasure errors, which are vastly easier to correct.

TI Quantum circuit designs of efficient squaring
SO QUANTUM INFORMATION PROCESSING
AB Quantum squaring circuits have been used as helpful arithmetic modules in various quantum algorithms for calculating series expansions or distances of vectors, etc. Quantum multipliers can replace quantum squaring circuits, but squaring with quantum multipliers is inefficient because it involves using quantum gates for unnecessary bitwise multiplication. In this paper, we propose a depth-optimized quantum circuit dedicated to squaring by eliminating these unnecessary quantum gates and implementing quantum gates in parallel. We also discuss the optimal distribution of the partial products to reduce further the gate cost of the quantum adder used for the sum of the partial products. The proposed partial product distribution method lowers the quantum adder's number of gates and depth by half. Our quantum squaring circuit is the most efficient, with an average improvement of 68% and 79.7% in T-count and T-depth, respectively, compared to existing quantum squaring circuits. Despite the increased qubit counts caused by the depth optimization, we demonstrate that the proposed circuit has the smallest KQT\documentclass[12pt]{minimal} \usepackage{amsmath} \usepackage{wasysym} \usepackage{amsfonts} \usepackage{amssymb} \usepackage{amsbsy} \usepackage{mathrsfs} \usepackage{upgreek} \setlength{\oddsidemargin}{-69pt} \begin{document}$$\hbox {KQ}_\textrm{T}$$\end{document}.

TI Application of quantum imaging in biology
SO BIOMEDICAL OPTICS EXPRESS
AB Application of quantum imaging in biology In biology, one of the main challenges is achieving a balance between high precision and minimal invasiveness in measurements. With cutting-edge techniques, the primary limitations to experimental accuracy often stem not from device-related noise but from fundamental physical constraints. Since nature is the underlying source of these constraints, it makes sense to go to quantum mechanics, the most basic theory of matter, for a solution. Improved measurement performance may be possible through the application of quantum effects, particularly those pertaining to coherence. It offers useful tools that, at the very least, offer interesting technical solutions even when they don't fully display cohesive behaviors. One of the primary applications of quantum technologies is quantum metrology, which uses the non-classical state of light to measure physical properties with great resolution and sensitivity. For biological applications, the quantum state of light may be utilized for precision enhancement and quantum noise reduction. This explains how quantum metrology, and particularly quantum imaging, can be used to enhance picture quality, measure shifts in quantum scales in biological systems, and boost imaging precision and resolution using quantum light sources, devices, and protocols. In this study, we give a summary of the possible uses of quantum technology in biology and medicine. This review presents a comprehensive overview of how quantum technologies can be applied in biology and medicine. It also explores the latest developments in quantum biological imaging, quantum microscopy, and quantum materials, while discussing the challenges and opportunities these emerging technologies bring.

TI An NV- center in magnesium oxide as a spin qubit for hybrid
   quantum technologies
SO NPJ COMPUTATIONAL MATERIALS
AB Recent predictions suggest that oxides, such as MgO and CaO, could serve as hosts of spin defects with long coherence times and thus be promising materials for quantum applications. However, in most cases, specific defects have not yet been identified. Here, by using a high-throughput first-principles framework and advanced electronic structure methods, we identify a negatively charged complex between a nitrogen interstitial and a magnesium vacancy in MgO with favorable electronic and optical properties for hybrid quantum technologies. We show that this NV- center has stable triplet ground and excited states, with singlet shelving states enabling optical initialization and spin-dependent readout. We predict several properties, including absorption, emission, and zero-phonon line energies, as well as zero-field splitting tensor, and hyperfine interaction parameters, which can aid in the experimental identification of this defect. Our calculations show that due to a strong pseudo-Jahn Teller effect and low-frequency phonon modes, the NV- center in MgO is subject to a substantial vibronic coupling. We discuss design strategies to reduce such coupling and increase the Debye-Waller factor, including the effect of strain and the localization of the defect states. We propose that the favorable properties of the NV- defect, along with the technological maturity of MgO, could enable hybrid classical-quantum applications, such as spintronic quantum sensors and single qubit gates.

TI Efficient Classical Simulation of Random Shallow 2D Quantum Circuits
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW X
AB A central question of quantum computing is determining the source of the advantage of quantum computation over classical computation. Even though simulating quantum dynamics on a classical computer is thought to require exponential overhead in the worst case, efficient simulations are known to exist in several special cases. It was widely assumed that these easy-to-simulate cases as well as any yet undiscovered ones could be avoided by choosing a quantum circuit at random. We prove that this intuition is false by showing that certain families of constant-depth, 2D random circuits can be approximately simulated on a classical computer in time only linear in the number of qubits and gates, even though the same families are capable of universal quantum computation and are hard to exactly simulate in the worst case (under standard hardness assumptions). While our proof applies to specific random circuit families, we demonstrate numerically that typical instances of more general families of sufficiently shallow constant depth 2D random circuits are also efficiently simulable. We propose two classical simulation algorithms. One is based on first simulating spatially local regions which are then ???stitched??? together via recovery maps. The other reduces the 2D simulation problem to a problem of simulating a form of 1D dynamics consisting of alternating rounds of random local unitaries and weak measurements. Similar processes have recently been the subject of an intensive research focus, which has observed that the dynamics generally undergo a phase transition from a low-entanglement (and efficient-to-simulate) regime to a high entanglement (and inefficient-to-simulate) regime as measurement strength is varied. Via a mapping from random quantum circuits to classical statistical mechanical models, we give analytical evidence that a similar computational phase transition occurs for both of our algorithms as parameters of the circuit architecture like the local Hilbert space dimension and circuit depth are varied and, additionally, that the effective 1D dynamics corresponding to sufficiently shallow random quantum circuits falls within the efficient-to-simulate regime. Implementing the latter algorithm for the depth-3 ???brickwork??? architecture, for which exact simulation is hard, we find that a laptop could simulate typical instances on a 409 ?? 409 grid with a total variation distance error less than 0.01 in approximately one minute per sample, a task intractable for previously known circuit simulation algorithms. Numerical results support our analytic evidence that the algorithm is asymptotically efficient.

AB In the race towards quantum computing, the potential benefits of quantum neural networks (QNNs) have become increasingly apparent. However, Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) processors are prone to errors, which poses a significant challenge for the execution of complex algorithms or quantum machine learning. To ensure the quality and security of QNNs, it is crucial to explore the impact of noise on their performance. This paper provides a comprehensive analysis of the impact of noise on QNNs, examining the Mottonen state preparation algorithm under various noise models and studying the degradation of quantum states as they pass through multiple layers of QNNs. Additionally, the paper evaluates the effect of noise on the performance of pre-trained QNNs and highlights the challenges posed by noise models in quantum computing. The findings of this study have significant implications for the development of quantum software, emphasizing the importance of prioritizing stability and noise-correction measures when developing QNNs to ensure reliable and trustworthy results. This paper contributes to the growing body of literature on quantum computing and quantum machine learning, providing new insights into the impact of noise on QNNs and paving the way towards the development of more robust and efficient quantum algorithms.

AB Recent progress in quantum computing has increased interest in the question of how well the existing proposals for post-quantum cryptosystems are suited to replace RSA and ECC. While some aspects of this question have already been researched in detail (e.g. the relative computational cost of pre- and post-quantum algorithms), very little is known about the RAM footprint of the proposals and what execution time they can reach when low memory consumption rather than speed is the main optimization goal. This question is particularly important in the context of the Internet of Things (IoT) since many IoT devices are extremely constrained and possess only a few kB of RAM. We aim to contribute to answering this question by exploring the software design space of the lattice-based key-encapsulation scheme ThreeBears on an 8-bit AVR microcontroller. More concretely, we provide new techniques for the optimization of the ring arithmetic of ThreeBears (which is, in essence, a 3120-bit modular multiplication) to achieve either high speed or low RAM footprint, and we analyze in detail the trade-offs between these two metrics. A low-memory implementation of BabyBear that is secure against Chosen Plaintext Attacks (CPA) needs just about 1.7 kB RAM, which is significantly below the RAM footprint of other lattice-based cryptosystems reported in the literature. Yet, the encapsulation time of this RAM-optimized BabyBear version is below 12.5 million cycles, which is less than the execution time of scalar multiplication on Curve25519. The decapsulation is more than four times faster and takes roughly 3.4 million cycles on an ATmega1284 microcontroller.

TI Quantum sensing of the electron electric dipole moment using ultracold
   entangled Fr atoms
SO QUANTUM SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB We propose a method to measure the electron electric dipole moment (eEDM) using ultracold entangled francium (Fr) atoms trapped in an optical lattice, yielding an uncertainty below the standard quantum limit. Among the alkali atoms, Fr offers the largest enhancement factor to the eEDM. With a Fr based experiment, quantum sensing using quantum entangled states could enable a search for the eEDM at a level below 10(-30) ecm. We estimate statistical and systematic errors attached to the proposed measurement scheme based on this quantum sensing technique. A successful quantum sensing of the eEDM could enable the exploration of new physics beyond the standard model of particle physics.

TI Super-compact universal quantum logic gates with inverse-designed
   elements
SO SCIENCE ADVANCES
AB Integrated quantum photonic circuit is a promising platform for the realization of quantum information processing in the future. To achieve the large-scale quantum photonic circuits, the applied quantum logic gates should be as small as possible for the high-density integration on chips. Here, we report the implementation of supercompact universal quantum logic gates on silicon chips by the method of inverse design. In particular, the fabricated controlled-NOT gate and Hadamard gate are both nearly a vacuum wavelength, being the smallest optical quantum gates reported up to now. We further design the quantum circuit by cascading these fundamental gates to perform arbitrary quantum processing, where the corresponding size is about several orders smaller than that of previous quantum photonic circuits. Our study paves the way for the realization of largescale quantum photonic chips with integrated sources and can have important applications in the field of quantum information processes.

TI A quantum computing approach for minimum loss problems in electrical
   distribution networks
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB This paper presents an application of a novel quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO) formulation to the minimum loss problem in distribution networks. The proposed QUBO formulation was conceived to be employed in quantum annealing-a quantum computing paradigm useful for solving combinatorial optimization problems. Quantum annealing is expected to provide better and/or faster solutions to optimization problems when compared to the ones provided by classical computers. With the problem at stake, better solutions result in lower energy losses, and faster solutions contribute to the same outcome given the future need for frequent reconfiguration of distribution networks to accommodate highly volatile demand, as anticipated by recent low-carbon solutions. The paper presents the results obtained through a hybrid quantum-classical solver for a standard 33-node test network and compares them with the ones obtained from classical solvers. Our main conclusion is that quantum annealing has potential to show advantage in the near future in terms of solution quality and time-to-solution, as quantum annealers and hybrid solvers continue to improve their performance.

TI Quantum blockchain: Trends, technologies, and future directions
SO IET QUANTUM COMMUNICATION
AB Blockchain technology is a highly developed database system that shares information within a business web. It stores details in blocks connected chronologically, ensuring information integrity through consensus mechanisms that prevent unauthorised alterations. This decentralised system removes the need for a believable mediator, mitigating vulnerabilities and enhancing transaction security. Blockchain's application spans the energy, finance, media, entertainment, and retail sectors. However, classical blockchain faces threats from quantum computing advancements, necessitating the development of quantum blockchain technology. Quantum blockchain, leveraging quantum computation and information theory, offers enhanced security and immutability. In this paper, different mathematical foundations, practical implementations and effectiveness of lattice-based cryptography in securing blockchain applications are discussed. Analysis of how the cryptographic techniques can protect blockchain systems against quantum attacks is being done by using mathematical formulations and examples. Quantum computing strengthens blockchain security with advanced encryption and authentication, which is critical for safeguarding diverse sectors from evolving cyber threats. Further study on quantum-resistant design is necessary if blockchain networks are to be robust and intact in the face of future technological developments.

TI Strategies for a practical advantage of fault-tolerant circuit design in
   noisy trapped-ion quantum computers
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Fault-tolerant quantum error correction provides a strategy to protect information processed by a quantum computer against noise which would otherwise corrupt the data. A fault-tolerant universal quantum computer must implement a universal gate set on the logical level in order to perform arbitrary calculations to in principle unlimited precision. In this paper we characterize the recent demonstration of a fault-tolerant universal gate set in a trapped-ion quantum computer [Postler et al., Nature (London) 605, 7911 (2022)] and identify aspects to improve the design of experimental setups to reach an advantage of logical over physical qubit operation. We show that various criteria to assess the break-even point for fault-tolerant quantum operations are within reach for the ion trap quantum computing architecture under consideration. Furthermore, we analyze the influence of crosstalk in entangling gates for logical state preparation circuits. These circuits can be designed to respect fault tolerance for specific microscopic noise models. We find that an experimentally informed depolarizing noise model captures the essential noise dynamics of the fault-tolerant experiment that we consider, and crosstalk is negligible in the currently accessible regime of physical error rates. For deterministic Pauli state preparation, we provide a fault-tolerant unitary logical qubit initialization circuit, which can be realized without in-sequence measurement and feed-forward of classical information. Additionally, we show that nondeterministic state preparation schemes, i.e., repeat until success, for logical Pauli and magic states perform with higher logical fidelity over their deterministic counterparts for the current and anticipated future regime of physical error rates. Our results offer guidance on improvements of physical qubit operations and validate the experimentally informed noise model as a tool to predict logical failure rates in quantum computing architectures based on trapped ions.

TI Operating Semiconductor Qubits without Individual Barrier Gates
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW X
AB Semiconductor spin qubits have emerged as a promising platform for quantum computing, following a significant improvement in their control fidelities over recent years. Increasing the qubit count remains challenging, beginning with the fabrication of small features and complex fan-outs. A particular challenge has been formed by the need for individual barrier gates to control the exchange interaction between adjacent spin qubits. Here, we propose a method to vary two-qubit interactions without applying pulses on individual barrier gates while also remaining insensitive to detuning noise in first order. Experimentally we find that changing plunger gate voltages over 300 mV can tune the exchange energy J from 100 kHz to 60 MHz. This allows us to perform two-qubit operations without changing the barrier gate voltage. Based on these findings we conceptualize a spin qubit architecture without individual barrier gates, simplifying the fabrication while maintaining the control necessary for universal quantum computation.

TI Topological power pumping in quantum circuits
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB In this article, we develop a description of topological pumps as slow classical dynamical variables coupled by a quantum system. We discuss the cases of quantum Hall pumps, Thouless pumps, and the more recent Floquet pumps based frequency converters. This last case corresponds to a quantum topological coupling between classical modes described by action-angle variables on which we focus. We propose a realization of such a topological coupler based on a superconducting qutrit suitably driven by three modulated drives. A detailed experimental protocol allowing to measure the quantized topological power transfer between the different modes of a superconducting circuit is discussed.

TI Automated Distribution of Polarization-Entangled Photons Using Deployed

SO PRX QUANTUM
AB The distribution of high-fidelity high-rate entanglement over telecommunication infrastructure is one of the main paths toward large-scale quantum networks, enabling applications such as quantum encryption and network protection, blind quantum computing, distributed quantum computing, and distributed quantum sensing. However, the fragile nature of entangled photons operating in real-world fiber infrastructure has historically limited continuous operation of such networks. Here, we present a fully automated system capable of distributing polarization-entangled photons over a 34-km deployed fiber in New York City, achieving high rates of nearly 5 x 105 5 pairs/s. Separately, we demonstrate a high fidelity of approximately 99% for rates up to 2 x 104 4 pairs/s. Lastly, we achieve 15 days of continuous distribution, with a network up-time of 99.84%. Our work paves the way for practical deployment of always-on entanglement-based networks with rates and fidelity adequate for many current and future use cases.

TI Visualizing quantum mechanics in an interactive simulation - Virtual Lab
   by Quantum Flytrap
SO OPTICAL ENGINEERING
AB Virtual Lab by Quantum Flytrap is a no-code online laboratory of an optical table, presenting quantum phenomena interactively and intuitively. It supports a real-time simulation of up to three entangled photons. Users can place typical optical elements (such as beam splitters, polarizers, Faraday rotators, and detectors) with a drag-and-drop graphical interface. Virtual Lab operates in two modes. The sandbox mode allows users to compose arbitrary setups. Quantum Game serves as an introduction to Virtual Lab features, approachable for users with no prior exposure to quantum mechanics. We introduce visual representation of entangled states and entanglement measures. It includes interactive visualizations of the ket notation and a heatmap-like visualization of quantum operators. These quantum visualizations can be applied to any discrete quantum system, including quantum circuits with qubits and spin chains. These tools are available as open-source TypeScript packages - Quantum Tensors and BraKetVue. Virtual Lab makes it possible to explore the nature of quantum physics (state evolution, entanglement, and measurement), to simulate quantum computing (e.g., the Deutsch-Jozsa algorithm), to use quantum cryptography (e.g., the Ekert protocol), to explore counterintuitive quantum phenomena (e.g., quantum teleportation and the Bell inequality violation), and to recreate historical experiments (e.g., the Michelson-Morley interferometer).

TI Fault-Tolerant One-Way Noiseless Amplification for Microwave Bosonic
   Quantum Information Processing
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON QUANTUM ENGINEERING
AB Microwave quantum information networks require reliable transmission of single-photon propagating modes over lossy channels. In this article, we propose a microwave noiseless linear amplifier (NLA) suitable to circumvent the losses incurred by a flying photon undergoing an amplitude damping channel (ADC). The proposed model is constructed by engineering a simple 1-D four-node cluster state. Contrary to conventional NLAs based on quantum scissors (QS), single-photon amplification is realized without the need for photon number resolving detectors. Entanglement between nodes comprising the device's cluster is achieved by means of a controlled phase gate. Furthermore, photon measurements are implemented by quantum nondemolition detectors, which are currently available as a part of the circuit quantum electrodynamics toolbox. We analyze the performance of our device practically by considering detection inefficiency and dark count probability. We further examine the potential usage of our device in low-power quantum sensing applications and remote secret key generation (SKG). Specifically, we demonstrate the device's ability to prepare loss-free resources offline, and its capacity to overcome the repeaterless bound of SKG. We compare the performance of our device against a QS-NLA for the aforementioned applications, and highlight explicitly the operating conditions under which our device can outperform a QS-NLA. The proposed device is also suitable for applications in the optical domain.

TI Entropy of the Quantum-Classical Interface: A Potential Metric for
   Security
SO ENTROPY
AB Hybrid quantum-classical systems are emerging as key platforms in quantum computing, sensing, and communication technologies, but the quantum-classical interface (QCI)-the boundary enabling these systems-introduces unique and largely unexplored security vulnerabilities. This position paper proposes using entropy-based metrics to monitor and enhance security, specifically at the QCI. We present a theoretical security outline that leverages well-established information-theoretic entropy measures, such as Shannon entropy, von Neumann entropy, and quantum relative entropy, to detect anomalous behaviors and potential breaches at the QCI. By linking entropy fluctuations to scenarios of practical relevance-including quantum key distribution, quantum sensing, and hybrid control systems-we promote the potential value and applicability of entropy-based security monitoring. While explicitly acknowledging practical limitations and theoretical assumptions, we argue that entropy-based metrics provide a complementary approach to existing security methods, inviting further empirical studies and theoretical refinements that can strengthen future quantum technologies.

TI A multilayered Pauli tracking architecture for lattice surgery-based
   logical qubits
SO ETRI JOURNAL
AB In quantum computing, the use of Pauli frames through software traces of classical computers improves computation efficiency. In previous studies, error correction and Pauli operation tracking have been performed simultaneously using integrated Pauli frames in the physical layer. In such a complex processing structure, the number of simultaneous operations processed in the physical layer exponentially increases as the distance of the surface code encoding logical qubit increases. This study proposes a Pauli frame management architecture partitioned into two layers for a lattice surgery-based surface code and describes its structure and operation rules. To evaluate the effectiveness of our method, we generated a random circuit according to the gate ratios constituting the commonly known quantum circuits and compared the generated circuit with the existing Pauli frame and our method. Simulations show a decrease of about 5% over traditional methods. In the case of experiments that only increase the code distance of the logical qubit, it can be seen that the effect of reducing the physical operation through the logical Pauli frame becomes more important.

TI An efficient quantum algorithm for ensemble classification using bagging
SO IET QUANTUM COMMUNICATION
AB Ensemble methods aggregate predictions from multiple models, typically demonstrating improved accuracy and reduced variance compared to individual classifiers. However, they often come with significant memory usage and computational time requirements. A novel quantum algorithm that leverages quantum superposition, entanglement, and interference to construct an ensemble of classification models using bagging as an aggregation strategy is introduced. Through the generation of numerous quantum trajectories in superposition, the authors achieve B transformations of the training set with only logB $\mathit{log}\left(B\right)$ operations, allowing an exponential enlargement of the ensemble size while linearly increasing the depth of the corresponding circuit. Moreover, when assessing the algorithm's overall cost, the authors demonstrate that the training of a single weak classifier contributes additively to the overall time complexity, as opposed to the multiplicative impact commonly observed in classical ensemble methods. To illustrate the efficacy of the authors' approach, experiments on reduced real-world datasets utilising the IBM qiskit environment to demonstrate the functionality and performance of the proposed algorithm are introduced.
   A new quantum algorithm that exploits quantum superposition, entanglement, and interference to build an ensemble of classification models is introduced. Thanks to the generation of several quantum trajectories in superposition, the authors obtain an exponentially large number of base models increasing only linearly the depth of the correspondent quantum circuit.

We then present an algebraic geometry-based algorithm for embedding a problem onto a hardware that is not fully connected, along with a companion Integer Programming (IP) approach. Next, we discuss the performance of two photonic devices - the Temporal Multiplexed Ising Machine (TMIM) and the Spatial Photonic Ising Machine (SPIM) - on Max-Cut and Number Partitioning instances.

TI A memristive neural decoder for cryogenic fault-tolerant quantum error
   correction
SO QUANTUM SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB Neural decoders for quantum error correction rely on neural networks to classify syndromes extracted from error correction codes and find appropriate recovery operators to protect logical information against errors. Its ability to adapt to hardware noise and long-term drifts make neural decoders promising candidates for inclusion in a fault-tolerant quantum architecture. However, given their limited scalability, it is prudent that small-scale (local) neural decoders are treated as first stages of multi-stage decoding schemes for fault-tolerant quantum computers with millions of qubits. In this case, minimizing the decoding time to match the stabilization measurements frequency and a tight co-integration with the QPUs is highly desired. Cryogenic realizations of neural decoders can not only improve the performance of higher stage decoders, but they can minimize communication delays, and alleviate wiring bottlenecks. In this work, we design and analyze a neural decoder based on an in-memory computation (IMC) architecture, where crossbar arrays of resistive memory devices are employed to both store the synaptic weights of the neural decoder and perform analog matrix-vector multiplications. In simulations supported by experimental measurements, we investigate the impact of TiOx-based memristive devices' non-idealities on decoding fidelity. We develop hardware-aware re-training methods to mitigate the fidelity loss, restoring the ideal decoder's pseudo-threshold for the distance-3 surface code. This work provides a pathway to scalable, fast, and low-power cryogenic IMC hardware for integrated fault-tolerant quantum error correction.

TI Electric field dependence of spin qubit in a Si-MOS quantum dot
SO CHINESE PHYSICS B
AB Valley, the intrinsic feature of silicon, is an inescapable subject in silicon-based quantum computing. At the spin-valley hotspot, both Rabi frequency and state relaxation rate are significantly enhanced. With protection against charge noise, the valley degree of freedom is also conceived to encode a qubit to realize noise-resistant quantum computing. Here, based on the spin qubit composed of one or three electrons, we characterize the intrinsic properties of valley in an isotopically enriched silicon quantum dot (QD) device. For one-electron qubit, we measure two electric-dipole spin resonance (EDSR) signals which are attributed to partial occupation of two valley states. The resonance frequencies of two EDSR signals have opposite electric field dependences. Moreover, we characterize the electric field dependence of the upper valley state based on three-electron qubit experiments. The difference of electric field dependences of the two valleys is 52.02 MHz/V, which is beneficial for tuning qubit frequency to meet different experimental requirements. As an extension of electrical control spin qubits, the opposite electric field dependence is crucial for qubit addressability, individual single-qubit control and two-qubit gate approaches in scalable quantum computing.

TI Quantum process tomography with unsupervised learning and tensor
   networks
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB The impressive pace of advance of quantum technology calls for robust and scalable techniques for the characterization and validation of quantum hardware. Quantum process tomography, the reconstruction of an unknown quantum channel from measurement data, remains the quintessential primitive to completely characterize quantum devices. However, due to the exponential scaling of the required data and classical post-processing, its range of applicability is typically restricted to one- and two-qubit gates. Here, we present a technique for performing quantum process tomography that addresses these issues by combining a tensor network representation of the channel with a data-driven optimization inspired by unsupervised machine learning. We demonstrate our technique through synthetically generated data for ideal one- and two-dimensional random quantum circuits of up to 10 qubits, and a noisy 5-qubit circuit, reaching process fidelities above 0.99 using several orders of magnitude fewer (single-qubit) measurement shots than traditional tomographic techniques. Our results go far beyond state-of-the-art, providing a practical and timely tool for benchmarking quantum circuits in current and near-term quantum computers.

TI Perspective on the Current State-of-the-Art of Quantum Computing for
   Drug Discovery Applications
SO JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL THEORY AND COMPUTATION
AB Computational chemistry is an essential tool in the pharmaceutical industry. Quantum computing is a fast evolving technology that promises to completely shift the computational capabilities in many areas of chemical research by bringing into reach currently impossible calculations. This perspective illustrates the near-future applicability of quantum computation of molecules to pharmaceutical problems. We briefly summarize and compare the scaling properties of state-of-the-art quantum algorithms and provide novel estimates of the quantum computational cost of simulating progressively larger embedding regions of a pharmaceutically relevant covalent protein-drug complex involving the drug Ibrutinib. Carrying out these calculations requires an error corrected quantum architecture that we describe. Our estimates showcase that recent developments on quantum phase estimation algorithms have dramatically reduced the quantum resources needed to run fully quantum calculations in active spaces of around 50 orbitals and electrons, from estimated over 1000 years using the Trotterization approach to just a few days with sparse qubitization, painting a picture of fast and exciting progress in this nascent field.

TI Range-separated density functional theory using multiresolution analysis
   and quantum computing
SO JOURNAL OF COMPUTATIONAL CHEMISTRY
AB Quantum computers are expected to outperform classical computers for specific problems in quantum chemistry. Such calculations remain expensive, but costs can be lowered through the partition of the molecular system. In the present study, partition was achieved with range-separated density functional theory (RS-DFT). The use of RS-DFT reduces both the basis set size and the active space size dependence of the ground state energy in comparison with the use of wave function theory (WFT) alone. The utilization of pair natural orbitals (PNOs) in place of canonical molecular orbitals (MOs) results in more compact qubit Hamiltonians. To test this strategy, a basis-set independent framework, known as multiresolution analysis (MRA), was employed to generate PNOs. Tests were conducted with the variational quantum eigensolver for a number of molecules. The results show that the proposed approach reduces the number of qubits needed to reach a target energy accuracy.
   The performance of existing quantum computers is limited by noise, especially for calculations which involve large molecular systems. One possible solution is to transfer some of the computational load to a classical computer. Such transfer can be achieved by assigning one portion of the electronic repulsion to a quantum computer and the remainder to a classical computer. The use of pair natural orbitals enables a further reduction of the computational load placed on a quantum computer. image

TI Maximizing the practical achievability of quantum annealing attacks on
   factorization-based cryptography
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ELECTRONICS AND TELECOMMUNICATIONS
AB work focuses on quantum methods for cryptanalysis of schemes based on the integer factorization problem and the discrete logarithm problem. We demonstrate how to practically solve the largest instances of the factorization problem by improving an approach that combines quantum and classical computations, assuming the use of the best publicly available special-class quantum computer: the quantum annealer. We achieve new computational experiment results by solving the largest instance of the factorization problem ever announced as solved using quantum annealing, with a size of 29 bits. The core idea of the improved approach is to leverage known subexponential classical method to break the problem down into many smaller computations and perform the most critical ones on a quantum computer. This approach does not reduce the complexity class, but it assesses the pragmatic capabilities of an attacker. It also marks a step forward in the development of hybrid methods, which in practice may surpass classical methods in terms of efficiency sooner than purely quantum computations will.

TI Efficient particle-conserving symmetric quantum circuits
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB The variational quantum simulation technique on gate-based quantum processors can be made more efficient if symmetries of the Hamiltonian system of interest are factored into the design construction of the underlying parameterized quantum circuits (PQC) needed by the technique. In the first part of this work, we present an easy and practical approach that can be used to construct symmetric quantum circuits. The method we present can directly be adapted for any symmetry, though in the present work we focus explicitly on the examples of Z2, Z3, and particle number conservation. We show how to construct symmetric gates that respects the aforementioned symmetries. In the second part, we focus on numerical analysis of parameterized particle-conserving gates. In variational quantum simulation, for example, the variational quantum eigensolver (VQE), the symmetric gates of the PQC are parameterized. Since there are often many possible inequivalent parametrizations, it is often not immediately obvious which gate parametrization would be most efficient in general for a wide range of Hamiltonians that respect the symmetry. We streamline our analysis to particle-conserving circuits and Hamiltonians. We numerically analyze the efficiency of different particle-conserving gate parametrizations by studying two examples, namely, a physics problem of learning the ground state of Heisenberg spin chains, and an artificial problem of learning the random arbitary states sampled within the particle number conserved subspace.

TI Entangling quantum memories via heralded photonic Bell measurement
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB A common way to entangle quantum memories is via photonic entanglement swaps. Each of two memories, connected by an optical channel, emits a photonic qubit entangled with itself, and the photonic qubits undergo an entanglement swap on a beamsplitter in the middle of the channel. We compare two choices of encoding of the photonic qubit: single rail and dual rail. At low channel loss the dual-rail scheme outperforms the singlerail scheme. However, as expected, the high-loss rate asymptote for the dual-rail scheme scales quadratically worse with loss compared with single rail. Considering the following nonidealities: imperfect mode matching at the swap, carrier-phase mismatch across the interfered photonic qubits, and detector excess noise, we evaluate the density operator of the heralded two-qubit entangled state. We calculate a lower bound on its distillable entanglement per copy, and its fidelity (with the ideal Bell state). For both schemes, imperfect swap-visibility results in a constant-factor decrease in the rate, while excess noise results in a dropoff of distillable entanglement beyond a certain total channel loss threshold, to zero. Despite the single-rail scheme's better rate-loss scaling, it is more severely affected by excess noise. The single-rail scheme is adversely affected by stochastic carrier-phase mismatch, which does not affect the dual-rail scheme. We study entanglement distillation on the heralded noisy entangled states for both methods and outline a suite of quantum networking studies that our work could incite.

TI Quantum correlations beyond entanglement in a classical-channel model of
   gravity
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB A direct quantization of the Newtonian interaction between two masses is known to establish entanglement, which if detected would witness the quantum nature of the gravitational field. Gravitational interaction is yet compatible also with gravitational decoherence models relying on classical channels, hence unable to create entanglement. Here, we show in paradigmatic cases that, despite the absence of entanglement, a classical-channel model of gravity can still establish quantum correlations in the form of quantum discord between two masses. This is demonstrated for the Kafri-Taylor-Milburn (KTM) model and a recently proposed dissipative extension of this. In both cases, starting from an uncorrelated state, a significant amount of discord is generally created. This eventually decays in the KTM model, while it converges to a small stationary value in its dissipative extension. We also find that initial local squeezing on the state of the masses can significanlty enhance the generated discord.

TI Circuit-Based Quantum Random Access Memory for Classical Data With
   Continuous Amplitudes
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON COMPUTERS
AB Loading data in a quantum device is required in several quantum computing applications. Without an efficient loading procedure, the cost to initialize the algorithms can dominate the overall computational cost. A circuit-based quantum random access memory named FF-QRAM can load M n-bit patterns with computational cost O(CMn) to load continuous data where C depends on the data distribution. In this article, we propose a strategy to load continuous data without post-selection with computational cost O(Mn). The proposed method is based on the probabilistic quantum memory, a strategy to load binary data in quantum devices, and the FF-QRAM using standard quantum gates, and is suitable for noisy intermediate-scale quantum computers.

TI Isotopic enrichment in lanthanide coordination complexes: contribution
   to single-molecule magnets and spin qudit insights
SO CHEMICAL COMMUNICATIONS
AB Lanthanide Single-Molecule Magnets (SMMs) fascinate the scientific community due to their plethora of potential applications ranging from data storage to spintronic devices and quantum computing. This review article proposes a comprehensive description of the influence of the nuclear spin, i.e. hyperfine interaction, on the magnetic properties of lanthanide SMMs and on quantum information processing of qudit. This influence is analysed for non-Kramers and Kramers lanthanide SMMs as well as for the electronic distribution of the electron in 4f orbitals i.e. oblate and prolate ions. Then the role of magnetic interactions in isotopically enriched polynuclear Dy(iii) SMMs is discussed. Finally the possible effect of superhyperfine interaction due to the nuclear spin of elements originating from the surrounding of the lanthanide centre is analyzed. The effect of nuclear spin on the dynamics of the lanthanide SMMs is demonstrated using different techniques such as magnetometry, muon spectroscopy (mu-SR), and Mossbauer and Resonance Vibrational Spectroscopies.

TI Crosstalk analysis for simultaneously driven two-qubit gates in spin
   qubit arrays
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
AB One of the challenges when scaling up semiconductor-based quantum processors consists in the presence of crosstalk errors caused by control operations on neighboring qubits. In previous research, crosstalk in spin qubit arrays has been investigated for nondriven single qubits near individually driven quantum gates and for two simultaneously driven single-qubit gates. Nevertheless, simultaneous gates are not restricted to single-qubit operations but also include frequently used two-qubit gates such as the CNOT gate. We analyze the impact of crosstalk drives on qubit operations, such as the CNOT and CPHASE gates. We investigate the case of parallel Y and CNOT gates, and we also consider a two-dimensional arrangement of two parallel CNOT gates and find unavoidable crosstalk. To minimize crosstalk errors, we develop appropriate control protocols.

TI Crosstalk analysis for single-qubit and two-qubit gates in spin qubit
   arrays
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
AB Scaling up spin qubit systems requires high-fidelity single-qubit and two-qubit gates. Gate fidelities exceeding 98% were already demonstrated in silicon-based single and double quantum dots, whereas for the realization of larger qubit arrays, crosstalk effects on neighboring qubits must be taken into account. We analyze qubit fidelities impacted by crosstalk when performing single-qubit and two-qubit operations on neighbor qubits with a simple Heisenberg model. Furthermore, we propose conditions for driving fields to robustly synchronize Rabi oscillations and avoid crosstalk effects. In our analysis, we also consider crosstalk with two neighbors and show that double synchronization leads to a restricted choice for the driving field strength, exchange interaction, and thus gate time. Considering realistic experimental conditions, we propose a set of parameter values to perform a nearly crosstalk-free CNOT gate and so open up the pathway to scalable quantum computing devices.

TI MULTILEVEL POLARIZATION FOR QUANTUM CHANNELS
SO QUANTUM INFORMATION & COMPUTATION
AB Recently, a purely quantum version of polar codes has been proposed in [1] based on a quantum channel combining and splitting procedure, where a randomly chosen two-qubit Clifford unitary acts as a channel combining operation. Here, we consider the quantum polar code construction using the same channel combining and splitting procedure as in [1], but with a fixed two-qubit Clifford unitary. For the family of Pauli channels, we show that polarization happens in multi-levels, where synthesized quantum virtual channels tend to become completely noisy, half-noisy, or noiseless. Further, we present a quantum polar code exploiting the multilevel nature of polarization, and provide an efficient decoding for this code. We show that half-noisy channels can be frozen by fixing their inputs in either the amplitude or the phase basis, which allows reducing the number of preshared EPR pairs compared to the construction in [1]. We provide an upper bound on the number of preshared EPR pairs, which is an equality in the case of the quantum erasure channel. To improve the speed of polarization, we propose an alternative construction, which again polarizes in multi-levels, and the previous upper bound on the number of preshared EPR pairs also holds. For a quantum erasure channel, we confirm by numerical analysis that the multilevel polarization happens relatively faster for the alternative construction.

TI Quantum computing for several AGV scheduling models

AB Due to the high degree of automation, automated guided vehicles (AGVs) have been widely used in many scenarios for transportation, and traditional computing power is stretched in large-scale AGV scheduling. In recent years, quantum computing has shown incomparable performance advantages in solving specific problems, especially Combinatorial optimization problem. In this paper, quantum computing technology is introduced into the study of the AGV scheduling problem. Additionally two types of quadratic unconstrained binary optimisation (QUBO) models suitable for different scheduling objectives are constructed, and the scheduling scheme is coded into the ground state of Hamiltonian operator, and the problem is solved by using optical coherent Ising machine (CIM). The experimental results show that compared with the traditional calculation method, the optical quantum computer can save 92% computation time on average. It has great application potential.

TI Cryogenic-compatible ultrahigh rejection and narrowband sinusoidal Bragg
   filter for integrated quantum photonics
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB The cryogenic environment offers a promising platform for integrated quantum photonic systems thanks to its low noise characteristics and compatibility with key quantum components, such as superconducting detectors and quantum dots. To harness the full potential of cryogenic integrated quantum photonic circuits, the development of cryogenic adapted on-chip optical filters with exceptional performance is crucial, particularly for efficient extraction of single photon signals from intense pump light in nonlinear processes like spontaneous four-wave mixing. In this work, we demonstrate a cryogenic-compatible Bragg filter, featuring a sinusoidal coherency-broken cascaded architecture for ultrahigh rejection and narrowband. Two subwavelength gratings are deployed to eliminate the residual transverse magnetic mode photons induced by imperfect polarization alignment. Furthermore, a niobium nitride film is deposited on the chip surface as a light absorption layer to suppress background noise caused by scattered photons. The fabricated filter exhibits a rejection ratio of 82 dB at room temperature, and maintains 76 dB at a cryogenic temperature of 2.2 K, with corresponding bandwidths of 0.9 nm and 0.8 nm, respectively. These results confirm the suitability of this filter for the cryogenic working environment, providing crucial support for the cryogenic-compatible integrated quantum photonic circuits.

AB Quantum computing is emerging as a key enabler of digital transformation in data science and STEM education. This study investigates how quantum computing can be meaningfully integrated into higher education by combining a dual approach: a structured assessment of the specialized literature and a practical evaluation of educational tools. First, a science mapping study based on 281 peer-reviewed publications indexed in Scopus (2015-2024) identifies growth trends, thematic clusters, and international collaboration networks at the intersection of quantum computing, data science, and education. Second, a comparative analysis of widely used educational platforms-such as Qiskit, Quantum Inspire, QuTiP, and Amazon Braket-is conducted using pedagogical criteria including accessibility, usability, and curriculum integration. The results highlight a growing convergence between quantum technologies, artificial intelligence, and data-driven learning. A strategic framework and roadmap are proposed to support the gradual and scalable adoption of quantum literacy in university-level STEM programs.

TI Optimisation of the routing protocol for quantum wireless Ad Hoc network
SO IET QUANTUM COMMUNICATION
AB This study addresses the optimisation of on-demand routing protocols for quantum wireless Ad Hoc network. The study improves the route discovery protocol by proposing a 'reverse synchronisation method', which means after the route request is completed, the quantum channel establishment process can be carried out simultaneously with the route reply process. This method is better than the general method which builds quantum channels after the forward path establishment, reduces the time and the number of messages for quantum channel establishment, thus improving the efficiency. Accordingly, this study elaborates the specific methods, procedures and related upgrading message formats involved in quantum route discovery, quantum channel establishment and qubit information transmission of on-demand routing protocol for quantum wireless Ad Hoc network.

TI Efficient Quantum Image Classification Using Single Qubit Encoding
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON NEURAL NETWORKS AND LEARNING SYSTEMS
AB The domain of image classification has been seen to be dominated by high-performing deep-learning (DL) architectures. However, the success of this field, as seen over the past decade, has resulted in the complexity of modern methodologies scaling exponentially, commonly requiring millions of parameters. Quantum computing (QC) is an active area of research aimed toward greatly reducing problems of complexity faced in classical computing. With growing interest toward quantum machine learning (QML) for applications of image classification, many proposed algorithms require usage of numerous qubits. In the noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) era, these circuits may not always be feasible to execute effectively; therefore, we should aim to use each qubit as effectively and efficiently as possible, before adding additional qubits. This article proposes a new single-qubit-based deep quantum neural network for image classification that mimics traditional convolutional neural network (CNN) techniques, resulting in a reduced number of parameters compared with previous works. Our aim is to prove the concept of the initial proposal by demonstrating classification performance of the single-qubit-based architecture, as well as to provide a tested foundation for further development. To demonstrate this, our experiments were conducted using various datasets including MNIST, Fashion-MNIST, and ORL face datasets. To further our proposal in the context of the NISQ era, our experiments were intentionally conducted in noisy simulation environments. Initial test results appear promising, with classification accuracies of 94.6%, 89.5%, and 82.5% achieved on the subsets of MNIST, FMNIST, and ORL face datasets, respectively. In addition, proposals for further investigation and development were considered, where it is hoped that these initial results can be improved.

TI Parent Hamiltonian Reconstruction via Inverse Quantum Annealing
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB Finding a local Hamiltonian 7-1 that has a given many -body wave function b p ) as its ground state, i.e., a parent Hamiltonian, is a challenge of fundamental importance in quantum technologies. Here we introduce a numerical method, inspired by quantum annealing, that efficiently performs this task through an artificial inverse dynamics: a slow deformation of the states b p (A ( t ) ) ) , starting from a simple state b p 0 ) with a known 7-1 0 , generates an adiabatic evolution of the corresponding Hamiltonian. We name this approach inverse quantum annealing. The method, implemented through a projection onto a set of local operators, only requires the knowledge of local expectation values, and, for long annealing times, leads to an approximate parent Hamiltonian whose degree of locality depends on the correlations built up by the states b p ( A )) . We illustrate the method on two paradigmatic models: the Kitaev fermionic chain and a quantum Ising chain in longitudinal and transverse fields.

TI Fiber-cavity enhanced and high-fidelity optical memory in cold atom
   ensemble
SO ACTA PHYSICA SINICA
AB Entanglement between a photon and an atomic memory is an important tool for quantum repeater research. By using the Duan-Lukin-Cirac-Zoller (DLCZ) process in the atomic ensemble, quantum entanglement between a photon and an atomic spin-wave memory is produced. With the further development of quantum information, it is necessary to put forward higher requirements for the diversity and controllability of quantum memory. In this work, we experimentally demonstrate an optical memory in cold atomic ensemble with enhanced fiber-cavity and high-fidelity optical memory for the first time. We design a fiber cavity to enhance the coupling strength between light and atomic ensemble and then improve the optical retrieval efficiency. Unfortunately, the use of fiber cavity may lead to the decrease of fidelity. Therefore, it is vital to realize high fidelity in the enhanced fiber-cavity optical memory. The cavity has a round-trip length of 1.5 m and a free spectral range of 190 MHz. The finesse (F) of the cavity with the cold atoms in the DLCZ condition is measured to be similar to 18. In cavity-enhanced DLCZ scheme, we use a fiber cavity instead of a stationary cavity. If a stationary cavity is used, the signal light will be reflected by the end mirror of the cavity and then pass back through the atoms. The storage of the backward signal light will generate a short-wavelength spin wave and then lead to a rapid decoherence of the memory. When cavity is locked by using the PDH frequency locking technique, we observe that the production probability of the Stokes photons is increased by 4.6 times higher than that without cavity and retrieval efficiency of atomic spin wave is increased by 1.6 times that without cavity due to the optical cavity enhancement effect. The presented cavity-enhanced storage shows that the retrieval efficiency is similar to 22%, corresponding to an intrinsic retrieval efficiency of similar to 40%, at the same time the fidelity of the quantum state is similar to 92%. The accomplishment of this project will provide another effective way of realizing long-distance quantum communication and large-scale quantum network construction.

TI Quantum Key Agreement Protocol Based on Four-Particle Cluster States
SO LASER & OPTOELECTRONICS PROGRESS
AB Owing to the unique properties of quantum mechanics, the quantum key agreement has unconditional security in theory. In this paper, a quantum key agreement protocol is designed. The four-particle cluster states are used as quantum sources. Two communication parties conduct joint Bell measurements respectively, and code through the controlled NOT gate and Hadamard gate to achieve shared secret. Here, weak measurement and quantum measurement reversal methods are used to deal with decoherence during transmission. The proposed key agreement protocol not only has the ability to respond to various participant and external attacks but also has higher communication efficiency.

TI A Lattice-Reduction Aided Vector Perturbation Precoder Relying on
   Quantum Annealing
SO IEEE WIRELESS COMMUNICATIONS LETTERS
AB Quantum annealing (QA) is proposed for vector perturbation precoding (VPP) in multiple input multiple output (MIMO) communications systems. The mathematical framework of VPP is presented, outlining the problem formulation and the benefits of lattice reduction algorithms. Lattice reduction aided quantum vector perturbation (LRAQVP) is designed by harnessing physical quantum hardware, and the optimization of hardware parameters is discussed. We observe a 5dB gain over lattice reduction zero forcing precoding (LRZFP), which behaves similarly to a quantum annealing algorithm operating without a lattice reduction stage. The proposed algorithm is also shown to approach the performance of a sphere encoder, which exhibits an exponentially escalating complexity.

AB Recent increasing interest in quantum computers has spurred research into practical engineering applications for quantum algorithms. One potential application is process control. The unique quantum phenomena involved with quantum computing brings up interesting considerations for control. This work focuses on non-determinism, first through a motivating simulation utilizing a continuous stirred-tank reactor. Following this, two methods of potentially ensuring system stability in the presence of non-determinism are discussed. The first involves including an additional gate to the modified Grover's algorithm presented in our previous work, which is designed to prevent a qubit state corresponding to an undesired control input from being measured. The second method involves defining an inner region where, if the state leaves the region, a classical stabilizing controller is activated to drive the state back inside the region.

TI Integrating Machine Learning Algorithms With Quantum Annealing Solvers
   for Online Fraud Detection
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB Machine learning has been increasingly applied in identification of fraudulent transactions. However, most application systems detect duplicitous activities after they have already occurred, not at or near real time. Since spurious transactions are far fewer than the normal ones, the highly imbalanced data makes fraud detection very challenging and calls for ways to address it beyond the traditional machine learning approach. This study has proposed a detection framework, and implemented it using quantum machine learning (QML) approach by applying Support Vector Machine (SVM) enhanced with quantum annealing solvers. To evaluate its detection performance, we have further implemented twelve machine learning methods, and compared the performance of QML application with these machine learning implementations on two datasets: Israel credit card transactions (non-time series) which is moderately imbalanced, and a bank loan dataset (time series) that is highly imbalanced. The result shows that, the quantum enhanced SVM has categorically outperformed the rest in both speed and accuracy with the bank loan dataset. However, its detection accuracy is similar to others with Israel credit card transactions data. Furthermore, for both datasets, feature selection has been shown to significantly improve the detection speed, although the improvement on accuracy is marginal. These findings have demonstrated the potential of QML applications on time series based, highly imbalanced data, and the merit of traditional machine learning approaches in non-time series data. This study provides insight on selecting appropriate approach with different types of datasets while taking into consideration the tradeoffs of speed, accuracy, and cost.

TI Lindbladian Decoherence in Quantum Universal Gates: An Insight Analysis
   for Digital Noise and Thermalisation
SO ENTROPY
AB Quantum computing is an emergent field promising the improvement of processing speed in key algorithms by reducing their exponential scaling to polynomial, thus enabling solutions to problems that exceed classical computational capabilities. Gate-based quantum computing is the most common approach but still faces high levels of noise and decoherence. Gates play the role of probability mixers codifying information settled in quantum systems. However, they are deviated from their programmed behaviour due to those decoherent effects as a hidden source modifies the desired probability flux. Their quantification of such unavoidable behaviours becomes crucial for quantum error correction or mitigation. This work presents an approach to decoherence in quantum circuits using the Lindblad master equation to model the impact of noise and thermalisation underlying the ideal programmed behaviour expected for processing gates. The Lindblad approach then provides a comprehensive tool to model both probability fluxes being present in the process, thus regarding the gate and the environment. It analyses the deviation of resulting noisy states from the ideal unitary evolution of some gates considered as universal, setting some operating regimes. Thermalisation considers a radiation bath where gates are immersed as a feasible model of decoherence. Numerical simulations track the information loss as a function of the decay rate magnitude. It also exhibits the minimal impact on decoherence coming from particular quantum states being processed, but a higher impact on the number of qubits being processed by the gate. The methodology provides a unified framework to characterise the processing probability transport in quantum gates, including noise or thermalisation effects.

TI Characterising port-based teleportation as universal simulator of qubit
   channels
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICS A-MATHEMATICAL AND THEORETICAL
AB Port-based teleportation (PBT) is a teleportation protocol that employs a number of Bell pairs and a joint measurement to enact an approximate input-output identity channel. Replacing the Bell pairs with a different multi-qubit resource state changes the enacted channel and allows the PBT protocol to simulate qubit channels beyond the identity. The channel resulting from PBT using a general resource state is consequently of interest. In this work, we fully characterise the Choi matrix of the qubit channel simulated by the PBT protocol in terms of its resource state. We also characterise the PBT protocol itself, by finding a description of the map from the resource state to the Choi matrix of the channel that is simulated by using that resource state. Finally, we exploit our expressions to show improved simulations of the amplitude damping channel by means of PBT with a finite number of ports.

TI Quantum annealing for the two-level facility location problem
SO FUTURE GENERATION COMPUTER SYSTEMS-THE INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ESCIENCE
AB This study explores the effectiveness of quantum approaches in addressing combinatorial optimization problems, arising in the logistics domain. In particular, we concentrate on the two-level Facility Location Problem, which is known to be NP-hard and therefore unable to be solved in a polynomial amount of time. Due to the difficulties in addressing these problems, we explore the potential of quantum annealing techniques to solve the Quantum Unconstrained Binary Optimization formulation, using the D-Wave solver. Furthermore, given that this formulation is still underperforming for large instances, we propose a method to preprocess the logistic network. This method has been developed with the intention of reducing the size of the logistic network, thus allowing for improved system performance as the size of the instances increases. We demonstrate the efficacy of our proposed solution approach through the execution of computational experiments. The objective of these experiments is to validate the performance of quantum annealing with our preprocessing network techniques.

TI Reducing circuit depth in quantum state preparation for quantum
   simulation using measurements and feedforward
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW APPLIED
AB Reducing circuit depth and identifying an optimal trade-off between circuit depth and width is crucial for successful quantum computation. In this context, midcircuit measurement and feedforward have been shown to significantly reduce the depth of quantum circuits, particularly in implementing logical gates. By leveraging these techniques, we propose several parallelization strategies that reduce quantum circuit depth at the expense of increasing width in preparing various quantum states relevant to quantum simulation. With measurements and feedforward, we demonstrate that utilizing unary encoding as a bridge between two quantum states substantially reduces the circuit depth required for preparing quantum states, such as sparse quantum states and sums of Slater determinants within the first quantization framework, while maintaining an efficient circuit width. Additionally, we show that a Bethe wave function, characterized by its high degree of freedom in its phase, can be probabilistically prepared in a constant-depth quantum circuit using measurements and feedforward. We anticipate that our study will contribute to the reduction of circuit depth in initial state preparation, particularly for quantum simulation, which is a critical step toward achieving quantum advantage.

TI Fast Multiplexed Superconducting-Qubit Readout with Intrinsic Purcell
   Filtering Using a Multiconductor Transmission Line
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB Fast and accurate qubit measurement remains a critical challenge on the path to fault-tolerant quantum computing. In superconducting quantum circuits, fast qubit measurement has been achieved using a dispersively coupled resonator with a large externally limited linewidth. This necessitates the use of a Purcell filter that protects the qubit from relaxation through the readout channel. Here, we show that a readout resonator and filter resonator, coupled to each other both capacitively and inductively via a multiconductor transmission line, can produce a compact notch-filter circuit that effectively eliminates the Purcell decay channel through destructive interference. By utilizing linewidths as large as 42 MHz, we perform simultaneous readout of four qubits using a 56-ns integration window and benchmark an average assignment fidelity of 99.77%, with the highest qubit assignment fidelity exceeding 99.9%. Including the simulated readout ring-down time, the total readout duration was between 115 and 215 ns for the four qubits, which we anticipate can be reduced to around 100 ns with active ring-down pulse shaping. These results demonstrate a significant advancement in speed and fidelity for multiplexed superconducting-qubit readout.

TI Sweet-spot operation of a germanium hole spin qubit with highly
   anisotropic noise sensitivity
SO NATURE MATERIALS
AB Spin qubits defined by valence band hole states are attractive for quantum information processing due to their inherent coupling to electric fields, enabling fast and scalable qubit control. Heavy holes in germanium are particularly promising, with recent demonstrations of fast and high-fidelity qubit operations. However, the mechanisms and anisotropies that underlie qubit driving and decoherence remain mostly unclear. Here we report the highly anisotropic heavy-hole g-tensor and its dependence on electric fields, revealing how qubit driving and decoherence originate from electric modulations of the g-tensor. Furthermore, we confirm the predicted Ising-type hyperfine interaction and show that qubit coherence is ultimately limited by 1/f charge noise, where f is the frequency. Finally, operating the qubit at low magnetic field, we measure a dephasing time of T-2* = 17.6 mu s, maintaining single-qubit gate fidelities well above 99% even at elevated temperatures of T > 1 K. This understanding of qubit driving and decoherence mechanisms is key towards realizing scalable and highly coherent hole qubit arrays.

TI Quantum entanglement and classical correlation have the same form
SO EUROPEAN PHYSICAL JOURNAL PLUS
AB In agreement with the data, the quantum correlation between spins violates Bell's inequality by following a cosine curve when one analyzer is rotated relative to the other. In contrast, the linear correlation attributed to hidden variables has never been observed. Besides these well-established facts, we show here that classical covariance, Pearson correlation, between spins projected as up or down on the analyzer axes also follows the cosine form hitherto uniquely ascribed to the quantum mechanical expectation value. The common cause for the classical correlation is the conservation of intrinsic angular momentum that aligns the two spins antiparallel at the breakup. Thus, as long as the spins retain their orientations relative to each other, the measurement of one spin in a chosen frame of reference also discloses the opposite orientation of the other in that frame. Realizing that classical correlation has the same functional form as quantum entanglement sheds light on the foundations of modern physics and quantum computing.

TI Quantum Biology and the Potential Role of Entanglement and Tunneling in
   Non-Targeted Effects of Ionizing Radiation: A Review and Proposed Model
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MOLECULAR SCIENCES
AB It is well established that cells, tissues, and organisms exposed to low doses of ionizing radiation can induce effects in non-irradiated neighbors (non-targeted effects or NTE), but the mechanisms remain unclear. This is especially true of the initial steps leading to the release of signaling molecules contained in exosomes. Voltage-gated ion channels, photon emissions, and calcium fluxes are all involved but the precise sequence of events is not yet known. We identified what may be a quantum entanglement type of effect and this prompted us to consider whether aspects of quantum biology such as tunneling and entanglement may underlie the initial events leading to NTE. We review the field where it may be relevant to ionizing radiation processes. These include NTE, low-dose hyper-radiosensitivity, hormesis, and the adaptive response. Finally, we present a possible quantum biological-based model for NTE.

TI Investigating the use of multiple representations in university courses
   on quantum technologies
SO EPJ QUANTUM TECHNOLOGY
AB The field of Quantum Information Science and Technology (QIST) education presents unique challenges for both students and educators, such as the necessity of understanding abstract properties of quantum systems. To provide a more intuitive understanding of quantum systems, a multitude of qubit representations have been developed in recent years. Given the diversity of the field, a specific representation may be more suitable in one content area of than in another. Consequently, the choice of representation may vary considerably depending on the course orientation. However, no exhaustive analysis has been conducted into the differences between the representation of single- and multi-qubit systems in higher education QIST courses. Furthermore, the factors which influence the selection of a suitable representation remain open. To close this gap, we conducted an online survey with 25 educators at different German and Austrian universities on their use of representations in QIST-related courses. The results confirm the pivotal role of mathematical formalism in QIST education regardless of the specific course characteristics but also reveal an untapped potential for enhancing student learning through the intentional and comprehensive use of multiple external representations (MERs), especially in the case of multi-qubit systems. The findings are discussed within the context of the field of QIST and current insights into learning with MERs.

TI Estimate of the time required to perform a nonadiabatic holonomic
   quantum computation
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Nonadiabatic holonomic quantum computation has been proposed as a method to implement quantum logic gates with robustness comparable to that of adiabatic holonomic gates but with shorter execution times. In this paper, we establish an isoholonomic inequality for quantum gates, which provides a lower bound on the lengths of cyclic transformations of the computational space that generate a specific gate. Then, as a corollary, we derive a nonadiabatic execution time estimate for holonomic gates. In addition, we demonstrate that under certain dimensional conditions, the isoholonomic inequality is tight in the sense that every gate on the computational space can be implemented holonomically and unitarily in a time-optimal way. We illustrate the results by showing that the procedures for implementing a universal set of holonomic gates proposed in a pioneering paper on nonadiabatic holonomic quantum computation saturate the isoholonomic inequality and are thus time optimal.

TI Error-mitigated inference of quantum network topology
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW APPLIED
AB Paramount for performances of quantum network applications are the structure and quality of distributed entanglement. Here we propose a scalable and efficient approach to reveal the topological information of unknown quantum networks, and quantify entanglement simultaneously. The scheme exploits entropic uncertainty, an operationally meaningful measure of correlation, by performing only two local measurements on each qubit. Moreover, when measurement outcomes in each node are collectively evaluated, integrating uncertainty and mutual information enables a direct count of the number of bipartite sources between any two nodes. This surpasses what is possible via applying either approach solely. Moreover, quantum error-mitigation techniques, including probabilistic error cancellation (PEC) and virtual distillation (VD), which have been widely applied to suppress biases in single expectation value, are further incorporated to mitigate errors in entropic quantities. We find that PEC successfully removes deviations in correlation estimations. Meanwhile, VD extends the depolarizing noise strength that allows for valid bipartite entanglement certification from 8.8% to 26.4%, thus substantially enhancing robustness against bias-inducing noise in practical situations. The proposal is applicable to a broad variety of platforms and helps to spur future studies toward harnessing the advantages of quantum networks.

TI Anonymous Quantum Sensing
SO JOURNAL OF THE PHYSICAL SOCIETY OF JAPAN
AB A lot of attention has been paid to a quantum-sensing network for detecting magnetic fields in different positions. Recently, cryptographic quantum metrology was investigated where the information of the magnetic fields is transmitted in a secure way. However, sometimes, the positions where non-zero magnetic fields are generated could carry important information. Here, we propose an anonymous quantum sensor where an information of positions having non-zero magnetic fields is hidden after measuring magnetic fields with a quantum-sensing network. Suppose that participants are located in different positions and they have quantum sensors. After the quantum sensors are entangled, the participants implement quantum sensing that provides a phase information if non-zero magnetic fields exist, and POVM measurement is performed on quantum sensors. Importantly, even if the outcomes of the POVM measurement is stolen by an eavesdropper, information of the positions with non-zero magnetic fields is still unknown for the eavesdropper in our protocol. Here, tracelessness is guaranteed, and so our protocol is considered as anonymous. In addition, we evaluate the sensitivity of our proposed quantum sensors by using Fisher information when there are at most two positions having non-zero magnetic fields. We show that the sensitivity is finite unless these two (non-zero) magnetic fields have exactly the same amplitude. Our results pave the way for new applications of quantum-sensing network.
